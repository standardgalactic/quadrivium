Deflagrations

10.1.	
General features of deflagrations and detonations
There are two types of “combustion explosions”, i.e. deflagrations and detonations. There are other types of 
“explosions”, e.g. “physical explosions” of vessels by overpressure above the established limit due to overfill, 
as a result of runaway reaction, etc. The word “explosion” is rather a jargon and we will avoid applying it 
in this book where possible. Sometimes the use of term “explosion” could generate misunderstanding. For 
example, some standards do introduce wrongly from author’s point of view so-called “explosion limit”. 
This is done in spite of the fact that there can be a significant different between the “flammability limit”, 
which is relevant for deflagrations, and “detonability limit” (see further in this section).
Let us overview the most general features of gaseous deflagrations and detonations. Deflagration 
propagates with velocity below the speed of sound in the unburned mixture while detonation with 
velocity above the speed of sound. Deflagration front propagates by diffusion of active radicals and heat 
from combustion products to unburned flammable mixture. A detonation front is in principle different 
from a deflagration front. It is a complex of coupled leading shock and following the shock reaction zone 
as was for the first time suggested by Chapman (1899) and Jouguet (1905–1906).
The stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture flame propagation velocity in the open quiescent atmosphere 
in a 20 m diameter hemispherical cloud is growing up to 84 m/s, and an explosion overpressure is of the 
order of 10 kPa in the near field. Then, pressure in a blast wave decays inversely proportional to radius, 
while for high explosives the pressure decays inversely proportional to radius squared. The maximum 
deflagration pressure to initial pressure ratio in a closed vessel is essentially higher and equals to 8.15 
(BRHS, 2009). Detonation propagates faster than the speed of sound with the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) 
velocity and the CJ pressure, which for stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture are 1968 m/s and 1.56 MPa 
respectively (BRHS, 2009).

Deflagrations
Detonation is the worst case scenario for hydrogen accident. The detonability range of hydrogen in air 11-
59% by volume (Alcock et al., 2001) is narrower and within the flammability range of 4-75% by volume. 
It is worth noting that the detonability limits are not fundamental characteristics of the mixture as they 
strongly depend on the size of the experimental set up where they are measured. Indeed, a diameter of 
the tube, where detonation can propagate, should be of the order of a detonation cell size. However, the 
detonation cell size increases with approaching the detonability limits. Thus, the larger is the scale of an 
experimental apparatus the smaller is the lower detonability limit (the larger is the upper detonability 
limit). The important conclusion for practical applications is that the detonability limits of hydrogen-
air mixture of the same concentration expand with the scale of a flammable cloud. This explains the 
difference between the lower detonability limit of hydrogen 11% by volume reported by Alcock et al. 
(2001) and the “underestimated” value of 18% published in standard ISO/TR 15916:2004. Experimental 
values of the detonation cell size for a stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture are in the range 1.1–2.1 cm 
(Gavrikov et al., 2000).
Once initiated, detonation will propagate as long as the mixture is within the detonability limits subject 
of sufficient size of the cloud. The detonation wave is led by a von Neumann (1942) pressure spike, 
which has a short spatial scale of the order of one intermolecular distance, and is about double the CJ 
pressure. The detonation front has complicated 3D structure. The example of the hydrodynamic structure 
of detonation with characteristic cells is shown in Fig. 10–1 (Radulescu et al., 2005).

Some observations of DDT in hydrogen-air mixtures
Hydrogen is prone to the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). DDT can happen in different 
environment, including tubes, enclosures, etc.
The experimentally observed run-up distance for transition from deflagration-to-detonation (DDT) 
in stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture in a tube has typical length to diameter ratio of approximately 
100. The DDT phenomenon is still one of the challenging subjects for combustion research. Different 
mechanism are responsible for a flame front acceleration to a velocity close to the speed of sound in an 
unburned mixture, including but not limited to turbulence in an unburned mixture, turbulence generated 
by flame front itself, and various instabilities such as hydrodynamic, Rayleigh-Taylor, Richtmyer-Meshkov, 
Kelvin-Helmholtz, etc. Then, there is a jump from the sonic flame propagation velocity to the detonation 
velocity, which is about twice of the speed of sound at least for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture. 
The detonation wave is a complex of precursor shock and combustion wave propagates with a speed of 
von Neumann spike and its description can be found elsewhere (Zbikowski et al., 2008). Detonation 
front thickness is a distance from the precursor shock to the end of reaction zone where the Chapman-
Jouguet condition (sonic plane) condition is reached.

Deflagrations
The presence of obstacles in a tube can essentially reduce run-up distance for DDT. This is thought 
due to significant contribution of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability just before the DDT. Indeed, the 
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability increases a flame front area in both directions of a shock passage through 
the flame front as opposite to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, when only one direction is unstable to the 
pressure gradient (acceleration of flow in direction from lighter combustion products to heavier unburned 
mixture). The initiation of detonation during DDT is thought to happen in a so-called hot spot(s), which 
potentially could be located within the turbulent flame brush or ahead of it, e.g. in a focus of a strong 
shock reflection. The peculiarities of DDT mechanisms are not affecting parameters of a steady-state 
detonation wave following it.
DDT was observed during mitigation of deflagration in enclosure by the venting technique. Venting 
of a 30% hydrogen-air deflagration in a room-like enclosure with an internal jet camera and initially 
closed venting panels resulted in DDT with overpressures up to 3.5 MPa in experiments performed 
in the Kurchatov Institute by Dorofeev et al. (1995a). DDT was initiated a few milliseconds after the 
destruction of the venting panels. The photographs show the formation of an outflow followed by a 
localized explosion inside the enclosure near the panel. No effect of the igniting jet size, emerging 
from the jet camera, on the onset of detonation was observed. The volume size of the jet camera also 
had no effect, indicating the local character of the detonation onset. Authors suggested that the onset 
of detonation was not directly connected with jet ignition, but was specifically linked to the sudden 
venting. Indeed, a needle-like structured flame front with developed combustion surface can be induced 
by the venting as observed in experiments of Tsuruda and Hirano (1987). Flame front instabilities, in 
particular Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and rarefaction waves propagating into the enclosure after the 
destruction of the venting panel increase the mixing of the unburnt mixture and combustion products 
that can facilitate formation of “hot spots”. In partially reacted mixtures this may create an induction 
time gradient thereby establishing the conditions for DDT, e.g. by pressure wave amplification by the 
SWACER (Shock Wave Amplification by Coherent Energy Release, a term introduced by Lee et al., 1978) 
mechanism theoretically predicted by Zeldovich et al. (1970). The possibility of DDT initiation during 
a reflection of a pressure wave generated by the camera jet combustion cannot be excluded as well (this 
could “naturally” coincide with the start of the venting panel opening).
DDT was observed in a large-scale test carried out by Pfortner and Schneider (1984) in Fraunhofer ICT 
(Germany). The experimental set up included a “lane” (2 parallel walls 3 m apart with height 3 m and 
length 12 m) and an enclosure (driver section) of sizes LxWxH=3.0x1.5x1.5 m (6.75 m3 volume) with 
an initially open to the “lane” vent of 0.82x0.82 m. The “lane” and the enclosure were filled with the 
same 22.5% hydrogen-air mixture kept under a plastic film. Venting of 22.5% hydrogen-air deflagration 
initiated at the rear wall of the enclosure by five ignitors into the partially confined space simulating a 
“lane” resulted in DDT. At a time of 54.61 ms after ignition the DDT occurred in the “lane” at the ground 
level, when the accelerated flame emerged from the driver section touched the ground.

Deflagrations
The onset of detonation in a 17% hydrogen-air deflagration was experimentally observed in a laboratory-
scale study by Ferrara et al. (2005). The experimental rig was a cylindrical vessel with a volume of 0.2 m3 
(LxD=1.0x0.5 m) connected to a dump vessel of a volume of approximately 50 m3 through a gate valve 
of diameter 16.2 cm and vent pipe (L=1 m, D=16.2 cm). The mixture was prepared by partial pressures 
in the primary vessel only. Ignition was initiated immediately after opening of the gate valve at the rear 
wall by a 16 J combustion engine spark plug. A sudden detonation spike of 1.5 MPa appeared in the 
pressure transients in the vessel only, well after the leading edge of the flame had left the vessel-duct 
assembly. Supposedly, the short backflow of products from the duct to the vessel led to turbulisation of 
combustion inside the vessel as was demonstrated in author’s previous research back to 1980th (Molkov 
et al., 1984). The entrainment of unburned mixture pockets by the high velocity hot gases can lead 
to violent ignition and, under certain circumstances, detonation as demonstrated by Lee and Guirao 
(1982). For a 17% hydrogen-air mixture at 0.1 MPa and 300 K the detonation cell size is about 15-16 
cm and reduces to 4 cm at 400 K following data in the report by Breitung et al. (2000). This could be a 
possible explanation of no detonation onset in a 16.2 cm diameter pipe and detonation onset in 50 cm 
diameter vessel, where unburned mixture was preheated by explosion pressure compression to at least 
400 K (Ferrara et al., 2005). The occurrence of a detonation wave in the main vessel in similar venting 
configurations was reported by Medvedev et al. (1994) on even a smaller scale for highly reactive mixtures 
with initial pressures higher than ambient.

Vented deflagrations
10.3.1.	
Pressure peaks structure
The phenomenon of double peak pressure structure for vented gaseous deflagrations has been well 
established since the beginning of research at 1950th, but it has not been explained on a satisfactory 
theoretical basis for a long time (Butlin, 1975). The existence of a two-peak pressure structure during 
venting of deflagration was demonstrated theoretically by models of Yao (1974), Pasman et al. (1974), 
Bradley and Mitcheson (1978), Molkov and Nekrasov (1981). The example of typical two peaks structure 
experimental pressure transient is presented in Fig. 10–3 (Dragosavic, 1973). The first peak is due to 
vent opening and the second peak is due to high combustion rate (large surface area) at the end of the 
deflagration.

Figure 10–3. Typical experimental pressure-time curve with two characteristic  
peaks P1 and P2 (Dragosavic, 1973). Here P0 is the vent opening pressure.
Later in Cooper et al. (1986) revealed a more complex four-peak pressure structure for rectangular 
enclosures and very low vent release pressures (see Fig. 10–4, top graph). Analysis of film records showed 
that pressure peak P1 is associated with vent opening and venting of unburned gas from enclosure 
(Fig. 10–4, top, middle, bottom). Due to higher velocity of hot gas compared to cold gas at the same 
pressure drop, burned gas venting begins almost immediately after the pressure peak P1 , when vent 
opening pressure is above 7.5 kPa (Fig. 10–4, middle, bottom), and thus contributes significantly to the 
fall in pressure at this stage of vented deflagration. The second peak P2 is due to “external explosion” or 
highly turbulent combustion of unburned mixture pushed out of the vessel. External combustion is not 
important at higher vent opening pressures since only small amount of unburned gas is ejected from 
the enclosure prior to its ignition, and the second peak can no longer be seen on pressure transients. 
Decrease of flame front area after flame touches the enclosure walls is responsible for the third peak 
P3. Cooper et al. (1986) stated that the fourth peak P4 is generated when pressure waves resulting from 
the combustion process couple with the acoustic modes of the vessel and set up sustained pressure 
oscillations thus satisfying the Rayleigh criterion (Rayleigh, 1945). The third P3 and fourth P4 peaks still 
occur at failure pressure 7.5 kPa (see Fig. 10–4, middle). At the highest vent opening pressure of 21.7 kPa 
(Fig. 10–4, bottom) only two peaks are observed. The second major peak is clearly due to acoustically 
enhanced combustion (Cooper et al., 1986). The peak P3 is no longer observed since the onset of the 
rapid combustion process responsible for P4 occurs prior to any significant reduction in flame area due 
to interaction of the flame front with the enclosure walls.

Deflagrations
It is worth noting that by increasing the failure pressure of relief panel above 7.5 kPa two pressure peaks 
becoming the dominant features of the observed pressure-time profiles (Fig. 10–4, middle and bottom 
graphs). This value has to be confirmed for hydrogen-air deflagrations as experiments by Cooper et al. 
(1986) were carried out with other flammable gas. Requirements in many industrial situations preclude 
the use of low failure pressure reliefs. In circumstances where a high failure pressure relief is employed 
the four pressure peaks identified by Cooper et al. (1986) will not all be discernible on any pressure 
trace as can be seen in Fig. 10–4. Moreover, the relative ease, with which the fourth acoustically driven 
peak can be significantly reduced in magnitude or eliminated altogether, suggests that in most practical 
situations acoustically enhanced pressures will be of little or no importance (Cooper et al., 1986; van 
Wingerden and Zeeuwen, 1983).
10.3.2.	
 Lumped parameter models of vented deflagrations
Why bother trying to improve lumped parameters models of vented deflagrations, when there exist much 
more powerful tools of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)? An answer given by Rasus and Krause 
(2001) is hard to disagree with: “For practical purposes, the detailed modelling of vented explosions, 
e.g. based on CFD codes, can be excessively sophisticated and time consuming and even not feasible 
for large and complex geometries”.
First lumped parameter theories of vented explosion dynamics were presented by Yao (1974) and Pasman 
et al. (1974). Detailed theory of spherical vented gaseous deflagration was published by Bradley and 
Mitcheson (1978). Further developments were made by an original theory of Molkov and Nekrasov (1981) 
when for the first time two lumped parameters were introduced into the model (turbulence factor and 
discharge coefficient). Over the years, the theory has been shown to predict reasonably well dynamics 
of gaseous deflagrations for both closed and vented enclosures for a wide range of explosion conditions. 
The history of development of this model is outlined briefly in (Molkov, 1995). Razus and Krause (2001) 
published a comparative study of a number of vent sizing approaches. From their work, Fig.1 p. 14, one 
can see that the model (Molkov and Nekrasov, 1981) compares favourably to its analogues in predicting 
vented deflagration overpressures. The accuracy of the model predictions for different fuel-air mixtures 
has been found to be higher in 90% cases of available experimental data (Molkov, 1999a) than those 
made using the approach offered in the standard NFPA 68 (2002).
The model by Molkov and Nekrasov (1981) has been successfully used since then for enclosures with 
inertia-free covers. The increase of the mass burning rate due to the growth of flame front area, flame front 
instabilities, and turbulence generated by venting process is taken into account by the turbulence factor, 
c, which is the first lumped parameter of the model. The second lumped parameter is the generalised 
discharge coefficient, m, whose value takes into account possible gas movement inside the enclosure that 
gives larger values as compared to small orifices in large vessels, when gas velocity within the vessel can 
be taken as zero with high accuracy.

Deflagrations
The model (Molkov and Nekrasov, 1981) has been validated broadly against experiments with non-inertial 
vent covers for different fuel-air mixtures, see e.g. (Molkov et al., 2000). The code CINDY, developed 
at the University of Ulster, includes the mentioned deflagration model, augmented by features enabling 
the user to predict pressure dynamics for various inertial vent cover designs, providing safety engineers 
with a sorely needed tool for vent sizing of inertial covers. Features of the CINDY code include several 
vent cover opening mechanisms, an option of multiple vents, original modelling of gas flows nearby the 
vent cover, and user-controlled variation of the turbulence factor and discharge coefficient over time.
10.3.3. Vented deflagrations with inertial vent covers
The first studies on the influence of vent cover inertia on explosion pressure were performed in the UK 
in the 1950’s by Wilson (1954), Cubbage and Simmonds (1955). Korotkikh and Baratov (1978) suggested 
that the cause of building destruction by internal deflagration was in most cases not insufficient vent 
area but excessive inertia of vent cover(s) and high release pressure. An important issue in inertial cover 
design is the upper limit of inertia that a given application might accept. Above the upper limit, the 
design might fail to open sufficiently, negating its purpose. To neglect the influence of vent cover inertia 
different values have been suggested: from 10 kg/m2 (Bartknecht, 1978) to 120 kg/m2 in relevant Russian 
standard. Details of the published results of various investigators into inertial effects are summarised in 
Molkov et al. (2004a).
In this section we present the next step in development that enables the lumped parameter model by 
Molkov and Nekrasov (1981) to take into account inertial venting devices of various types (Grigorash et 
al., 2004). We start with presenting a modification of the governing equations to include multiple vents 
of arbitrary nature acting concurrently. We continue with a description of our modelling of two types 
of inertial venting devices: translation panels, that include spring-loaded valves, and hinged doors. We 
conclude with reproducing our validation results for both types of these covers against the experiments 
by Höchst and Leuckel’s (1998) on vented gaseous deflagrations with inertial covers (surface density up 
to 124 kg/m2) in a large-scale 50-m3 silo, and experiments of Wilson (1954) with spring-loaded venting 
valves. 
10.3.3.1. Model assumptions and derivation of governing equations
It is assumed that a deflagration in uniform gaseous flammable mixture is initiated by an ignition source 
with low energy re­lease like a spark. The “low” means negligible in comparison with the internal energy 
of the mixture. The ignition source may reside anywhere inside an enclosure of arbitrary shape, volume 
V, with the ratio of the longest overall dimension to the shortest one not more than 5:1 (when pressure 
non-uniformity and wave effects could become important). The initial pressure and temperature are 
equal p
i and Tui respectively. In general case, obstacles can be distributed throughout the enclosure.

num­ber, S/cu, relating the flame velocity S and the speed of sound cu in the unburnt mixture, doesn’t exceed 
the value of about 0.1. This allows one to con­si­der pres­sure uniform throughout the space of enclosure, and 
changing only in time. The flamelet model of turbulent combustion is assumed for the conversion of fresh 
gases into combustion products. The conversion happens in the flame front that is negligibly thin. Heat 
losses are neglected because the deflagration time is short in comparison with the characteristic heat trans­
fer time from hot gases to walls and obstacles. The difference between the calculated adiabatic isochoric 
complete combustion pressure and the experimental one is roughly 10% (Kumar et al., 1989). Compression 
and expansion of gases comply with the adiabatic equation. Maché effect is neglected. Indeed, it was shown 
previ­ously that the influence of the phenomenon of non-uniform distribution of temperature throughout the 
space of the vessel is negligible, even for burning velocity determination by constant volume bomb technique 
(Metghalchi and Keck, 1982). This is even more correct for vented deflagration where the pressures are less 
due to venting. The specific heats ratios of unburnt gu and burnt gb gases are constant during deflagration. 
The molecular masses of unburnt and burnt gases are constant too. The gases themselves are assumed ideal.
Vents may appear as single or multiple units, either inertia-free or inertial of mass m. A latching pressure pv may 
be used to prevent vent opening until the target pressure is reached. An inertia-free vent opens instantaneously. 
The venting area Fj of each vent j with inertial cover varies with time, since inertial covers open gradually. The 
area Fj is calculated as the gap area between the edges of the cover and the vent opening, depending on the 
type of the cover (translating panel or hinged door), its size, and, in case of hinged doors, shape.

Deflagrations
Derivation of the vented deflagration model for the case of a single inertia-free venting device can be 
found elsewhere (Molkov and Nekrasov, 1981; Molkov, 1995). Here we will demonstrate how the model, 
and this derivation, changes in the case of multiple inertial venting devices. At the same time, let us 
introduce the entire necessary notation.
Let us refer the real flame front area Ff(t) at any moment t of time to the surface area Fs(t)=4p0rb
2  of a 
sphere of radius rb to which burnt gas inside the enclosure could be gathered at the same moment, and 
call this ratio, according to historically settled terminology, a turbulence factor c(t)=Ff(t)/Fs(t). Here 
p0 denotes “pi” number. The dependence of the burning velocity on temperature and pressure can be 
expressed as, see e.g. (Nagy et al., 1969; Bradley and Mitcheson, 1978), Su = Sui (Tu/Tui)m(p/pi)n, where 
subscript “i” stands for initial conditions. From the adiabatic equation pVg = const together with the 
ideal gas state equation one can easily derive the relationship, in which the dimensionless pressure is 
the ratio of current pressure to I nitial pressure in the vessel p= p/pi
T/Ti = (p/pi)(g-1)/g = p1-1/g.
(10–1)
This proportion allows one to express the burning velocity in the form
Su=Suipe,
(10–2)
where the values of thermokinetic factor e = m+n-m/gu along with the initial burning velocity Sui can be 
determined by the inverse problem method, i.e. by processing a pressure transient recorded in a closed 
spherical bomb, and are tabulated for some mixtures, see e.g. references in (Molkov, 1995). Denote su 
= ru/ri the relative density of the unburnt gas, where ri and ru are the initial and the current unburnt 
gas densities respectively. From the adiabatic equation written in the form p(m/r)g = const , where m is 
the mass, for both the initial and the current densities, one can see that

Denote nu = mu/mi and nb = mb/mi the relative masses; wu = Vu/V and wb = Vb/V the relative volumes

relative density of burnt gases throughout the enclosure we have

The above formula expresses the instantaneous change in the unburnt gases mass within the vessel due 
to combustion. In the following, we account for the other change to this mass is due to venting.
To distinguish between the unburnt and burnt gas outflows, the fraction of the area Fj(t) of a vent “j” 
occupied by burnt gas during outflow at any moment is denoted Aj(t). Then unburnt gases occupy (1-
Aj(t)) fraction of Fj(t). In the most general case of vented deflagration, only unburnt gases outflow from 
a vent at the beginning of venting, A=0. After that, joint outflow of unburnt and burnt gases takes place. 
At the end of the process, the outflow has to be accomplished by burnt gases only, A=1. An exception is 
the case of ignition in the close proximity of a relatively small vent, when burnt gases occupy the whole 
of the vent cross-section from the very start of venting, A=1. 
In 1997 author has analyzed motion pictures of vented deflagrations by various authors and showed that, 
in general, A=r2 is a reasonable estimate of the joint outflow. Particularly, this estimate is closer to the 
experimental results than the Yao’s (1974) estimate A=nb/(nb+nu). It should be noticed, however, that the 
estimate A=r2 gives unsatisfactory results under the special condition that the maximum deflagration 
pressure is comparable to the vent release pressure (denoted pv below). In the CINDY code, created at 
the University of Ulster, the user can control the estimate of A, by choosing the location of the ignition 
source position relative to the vent, as follow

Thus, equations (10–15), (10–16) and (10–24) constitute the system of governing equations. At the 
beginning of the integration (t = 0) of the governing equations, the following conditions are assumed: 
p = 1 since the pressure equals pi; nu= 1 and n­b = 0 since nothing has burnt yet. The integration of the 
governing equations can be done by any known method of solution of a system of ordinary differential 
equations. At any given moment of time, a number of dimensional deflagration parameters can be 
obtained, using the following simple formulae: t=t×a/Sui - the time of deflagration, sec; p=p×pi - the 
current pressure, Pa; Su=Sui×pe - the current burning velocity, m/sec; rb=r×a -the current radius of the 
imaginable spherical flame, m;

10.3.3.2.	 Modelling of vent covers
Equations (10–15), (10–16) and (10–24) above depend on the current venting area that changes with time, 
but the character of this change is not specified. This allows vent covers of any type to be “plugged in” 
the calculations, as long as the value of the current venting area F(t) can be calculated at each integration 
step. For any vent cover, in conditions of pressure growing with time, at some moment tvj, when the 
internal explosion pressure is equal to the pre-set “latch release” pressure pvj, the release of vent cover “j” 
occurs and outflow of gases from enclosure through vent “j” begins into the space. Depending on the 
vent cover type, the venting area either immediately becomes equal to the nominal vent area FN (non-
inertial or light vent covers, or rupture membranes) or increases gradually while vent cover moves away 
by the pressure force. Two common types of inertial venting devices are translation panels and hinged 
doors. The spring-loaded vent covers make a sub-class of the translation panels.

A translation panel is an inertial cover modeled as a flat solid body. Vertically translating panels may 
move either upwards from or downwards towards their starting position, while horizontally translating 
panels can only move horizontally away from their starting position. The translation of the panel is either 
unrestricted or constrained by an inelastic arrester or a linear spring.
The force of reduced pressure that invokes movement of a translation panel deserves separate attention. 
With the simplest approach to model vent cover displacement, the force f(t) of reduced pressure is

Equation (10-26) assumes the same magnitude of pressure applied across the entire internal (p(t)) and 
external (pa) surfaces of the vent cover. Application of the CINDY code, utilizing (10–26) to simulate both 
pressure and displacement in experiments by Höchst and Leuckel (1998) showed that while overpressures 
are successfully matched, backfitted displacements were too rapid compared to the experimental data 
(Molkov et al., 2003).
To account for the excessive displacement that the simple approach with (10–26) produces, consider 
the vent cover that has already travelled some distance away from the vent cross-section. The cover 
obstructs gases escaping from the vessel, and makes the gas flow change its direction by 90°. Thus some 
time after vent release, a jet forms under the moving vent cover. Molkov et al. (2003) have derived for a 
circular cover of radius R0 that taking this jet effect into account halves the value of the initial pressure 
force (10–26) as will be demonstrated in the next section

Simulations with CINDY code written according to the developed model showed that taking the jet 
effect into account by formula (10-27) produces a good match of the simulated panel displacement and 
pressure transients with the experimental data by Höchst and Leuckel (1998).
All in all, the procedure to calculate the pressure force is as follows. If a massive panel is completely 
covering a vent then the static pressure force that must overcome the gravity or spring load to lift the 
panel is given by formula (10–26). Formula (10–27) represents the pressure force when the jet effect is 
accounted for. We assume that transition from the “pressure” regime of formula (10–26) for the closed 
vent to the “jet” regime of formula (10–27) for the partially open vent is continuous. In the absence 
of evidence to the contrary, it is in direct proportion to the current venting area. The “jet fraction” 
parameter Ajet decides the fraction of the nominal venting area FN at reaching which the vent finds itself 
in the “jet” regime.

where a(t) is the vent cover acceleration, f(t) is the pressure force described above, m is the panel mass. 
The gravity acceleration g is directional. If the vent is located in the floor of the enclosure, formula  
(10–28) can be used with negative g. If the translation panel is mounted on the wall of the enclosure, 
then the gravity effects are neglected by setting g=0. If spring load is present, its contribution is expressed 
via the linear spring (Hooke’s) constant k, N/m, and the current panel displacement l, m. The venting 
area is calculated as the gap area between the edges of the panel and the vent opening, as F=lp, where p 
is the vent panel perimeter. This area is zero for a closed vent and is allowed to increase until it reaches 
the maximum value equal to the nominal vent area FN.
Hinged doors
A hinged door is an inertial cover modelled as a solid rectangle able to swing about one of its edges, the 
hinge, fixed on the enclosure (see Fig. 10–5). Denote b the length of the hinged side, i.e. the length of 
the door; L the length of the pivoting side, i.e. the width of the door. Then the nominal area of the vent 
opening and the area of the hinged door is FN = bL. 
Figure 10–5. Hinged door.
Let j be the angle between the vent opening and the hinged door. We assume the current venting area 
F(j) to be the gap area between the edges of the cover and the vent opening. The gap, see Fig. 10–5, is 
formed from one rectangular region, based on the door edge opposite to the hinge, and two triangular 
regions, based on the pivoting edges of the door. The current venting area is then

This area is zero for a closed vent (j=0) and is allowed to increase until it reaches the maximum value

the door is inelastically arrested at j = 90°.

To calculate the gas pressure force acting on the hinged door, we take into account the following. When 
the vent is closed, the pressure force is uniform throughout the door surface, and is determined as  
f = p(t)F­N=p(t)bL. When the vent commences to open, the picture changes. Firstly, the pressure of the 
moving gases on the door is smaller than the pressure inside the enclosure. Secondly, the pressure is not 
uniform along the door surface any more. 
We address the first issue by using the continuity law for the gas flowing between the enclosure insides, 
the vent cross-section and the current venting area(10–29). We deal with the second issue assuming 
that the pressure along the door surface changes as a linear function of the position on the width of the 
door. That results in the following formula for the torque applied by the gas static pressure force to turn 
the door on its hinge (Molkov et al., 2004b)

Our assumed linear change of pressure results in very easy derivations, picking up at least a part of the 
actual pressure change on the turning door. However, one realizes that the true pressure distribution 
may be anything but linear; the whole vent cover pushing phenomenon being three-dimensional, non-
stationary and dependent on the geometry of the cover and vent opening. To date, we have not been able 
to find a suitable theoretical explanation of the gas pressure distribution on the opening door. Therefore, 
it was decided to settle on the linear distribution augmented by an empirical coefficient Cjet as follows

The Cjet will compensate for the true non-linear, non-stationary and geometry dependent character of 
the hinged door movement. Notice that when the door is closed, j = 0, formula (10–30) gives 3 times 
smaller value than the torque should be

Therefore, we have to use different formulae for a closed or almost closed door and a sufficiently wide open 
door. When the door is shut or is opened within some small range of angles, we apply formula (10–32). 
Above a certain angle, we have to apply formula (10–31). Similarly to translation panels, transition from 
the “internal pressure” regime of formula (10–32) to the “jet” regime of formula (10–31) is assumed 
to be linear with respect to F(j)(10–29), with the empirical parameter Ajet looking after distinguishing 
between the two regimes. For consistency, we have to assume Cjet>⅓, such that formula (10–31) would not 
result in a value greater than formula (10–32) would, for the same pressures and the cover dimensions.

The applicability of formula (10-31) is limited in the angle j of the door opening. The formula will work only 
for the angles at which the current venting area F(j) is less than the nominal area FN . At a certain angle jN 
such that F(jN )=FN the area of the flow through the gap between the enclosure and the vent cover is equal to 
the area of the flow from an unrestricted vent of the same area. At j >jN , the vent is considered fully open. 
The continuing opening of the door does not affect the pressure dynamics inside the vessel. In our calculations, 
therefore, we assume that at angles of opening larger than jN, only gravity affects the door motion.
Having obtained the above formulae for the pressure force torque, one can determine the angular 
acceleration of the door from the following torque balance equations

for ceiling-mounted vents. The gravity acceleration g in these equations acts against the opening of the 
door. Equation (10–34) thus represents a ceiling-mounted vent, and equation (10–33) represents a wall-
mounted vent with the door hinged at its top horizontal edge. Letting g = 0 gives a wall-mounted vent 
with the door hinged at its vertical (side) edge. Letting g < 0 gives the situation when gravity helps the 
door opening. Then equation (10-34) represents a floor-mounted vent that opens downwards. Equation 
(10–33) represents a wall-mounted vent with the door hinged at its bottom horizontal edge, a device 
that can be found, e.g. in (Zalosh, 1978).
Comparison with experiments
Our models of vented deflagration with inertial vent covers described in the previous section depend 
on empirical parameter Ajet, and also Cjet for hinged doors. To find the values of these parameters and 
to check the overall plausibility of the models, we have validated them against large scale experiments 
on vented methane-air deflagrations (Höchst and Leuckel, 1998). The paper by Höchst and Leuckel 
(1998) is rare in that it contains both pressure and displacement histories, for both translation panels 
and hinged doors. In what follows, “experiment 3-A” or “3-A” denotes experimental results plotted in 
Fig. 3a on page 92 of (Höchst and Leuckel, 1998), similarly “3-B”, “3-C” and “3-D” correspond to Figs. 
3b, 3c and 3d on page 92 of (Höchst and Leuckel, 1998). All experiments were performed in a 50-m3 silo 
with a venting device(s) on its top. In explosions 3-A and 3-C the cover of a single vent was a circular 
translation panel of inertia 89 kg/m2 and 42 kg/m2 with an arrester. Explosions 3-B and 3-D were vented 
each with a couple of rectangular hinged doors of inertia 124 kg/m2 and 73 kg/m2. Explosions 3-A and 
3-B were performed in initially quiescent mixtures, 3-C and 3-D in fan-assisted turbulent mixtures.
For venting with translation panels, cases 3-A and 3-C, a detailed description of the cover dimensions, 
initial values, and matching the model to the data is done in (Molkov et al., 2003). Here, Fig. 10–6 
compares our best-match computed transients with the experimental results.

Höchst and Leuckel (1998) noticed that their translation panel in experiment 3-A was 3 degrees tilted 
in motion. The displacement curves for 3-A reflect the movement of the faster and the slower edge 
of the panel, respectively. In experiment 3-C there was no panel tilt. All the four computed curves in  
Fig. 10–6 were achieved with the same value of the empirical vent cover parameter: Ajet = 0.1.
Validation of the case with spring-loaded covers is presented for a number of experiments in paper 
by Molkov et al. (2005). Example of our calculations of experiment 17A (Wilson, 1954) are shown in 
Fig. 10–7 for both displacement and pressure dynamics. Results indicate that the model matches the 
experiment with spring-loaded inertial covers well, in a way similar to the translation panels described 
above. The main details of experiment 17A (Wilson, 1954) in the apparatus with free volume of 1.72 
m3 and a single spring-loaded valve, opening outwards horizontally, of the 0.46 m diameter are: 2% by 
volume pentane-air mixture, 40.1 kg vent cover (244.5 kg/m2 surface density).

For venting with hinged doors, cases 3-B and 3-D (Höchst and Leuckel, 1998), the initial data were as 
follows. Each test was performed with two identical doors that acted simultaneously, exhibiting the same 
behaviour. From the experimental data by Höchst and Leuckel (1998) we derived that in the case 3-B 
each door mass was 118.7 kg and the opening pressure was 1.03 × 105 Pa, in the case 3-D the respective 
values were 69.88 kg and 1.02 × 105 Pa. The other parameters were the same in both cases: gu = 1.39, gb 
= 1.25, e = 0.3, Sui = 0.38 m/s, Mui = 27.24 kg/kmol, Tui = 298 K, Ei = 7.4, V = 50 m3, pa = pi = 1.0 × 105 
Pa, b = 1.383 m and L = 0.692 m. Figure 10–8 presents our best-match computed curves in comparison 
with the experimental transients. Simulations completed when there was no unburt gases left. In the 
case 3-B, this happened before the doors have reached 70o of opening.

For hinged vent covers, Ajet and Cjet were determined through matching of CINDY code predictions of 
experiments 3-B and 3-D. Ajet for the hinged covers was selected for the same reason as for the translating 
covers: it represents a threshold below which jetting flows are not yet fully established. Then sequences of values 
of c and m were found giving the best fit of the calculated pressure to the experiments. The calculated versus 
experimental cover angular displacements were then compared and a new Ajet selected as necessary. When both 
the calculated and experimental pressures and displacements were well matched, Ajet had a value of 0.05. The 
best overall curve match was achieved at Cjet = 1.4. The optimization of the found empirical values of Ajet , Cjet 
is discussed in detail in (Molkov et al., 2004b). The turbulence factor c varied as a piecewise-linear function 
as the calculations progressed, the best-fit values of c for the two experiments were as shown in Fig. 10–9.

10.3.3.3. Inertial vent cover jet effect
Here we will demonstrat that the formation of a jet of escaping gases under a vent cover drastically 
influences transient explosion pressure and cover movement. Mathematical modelling of the pressure 
distribution, including the effect of jetting flow of deflagration products, results in a pressure force on 
vent cover half that predicted by traditional “straight forward” theory (applied in the previous section). 
It is determined by comparison with experimental data that the change from full pressure to reduced 
due to jet effect pressure on the inertial vent panel comes when the virtual venting area reaches 5–10% 
of the full venting area. 
Disadvantages of thin bursting discs and similar devices include their sensitivity to fatigue caused by 
pressure fluctuations, poor heat insulation from the external environment, which often causes problems, 
e.g. with water condensation, unplanned “increase” of their mass, e.g. due to snow deposition, etc. To 
avoid these problems with above mentioned venting devices an inertial explosion door or pop-out 
panel can be applied. There are many types of explosion doors and similar pressure venting elements 
as considered in previous section: translation, spring-loaded, hinged. During vent cover movement, 
the size of the opening between the venting element and the vessel is taken as the actual venting area.
Translating pressure relief devices can be dangerous in operation because they could become missiles 
if unrestrained. Debris missiles and their trajectories have already received attention in the safety 
engineering community, see for example studies by Efimenko et al. (1998), Kao and Duh (2002), Baker et 
al. (1983), etc. It is important to accurately model forces acting on vent cover to predict distances at which 
unrestrained inertial venting elements could have damaging action and thus affect separation distance.
Let us consider a typical deflagration protection system, when a heavy vent cover is located over the 
vent at the top of enclosure, e.g. the restrained vertically translating cover used by Höchst and Leuckel 
(1998). The simplest “obvious” approach to model vent cover displacement is as follows. The total pressure 
force applied to the vent cover consists of the pressure force, due to the difference of the pressure on its 
internal (transient explosion pressure inside enclosure) and external (atmospheric pressure) surfaces.

, where A is the 
nominal vent area, m2; p(t) is the transient explosion pressure inside the vessel, Pa; pa is atmospheric 
pressure, Pa; and f(t) is the total force applied to the vent cover, N. This equation assumes the same 
magnitude of pressure applied across the entire internal, p(t), and external, pa, surfaces of the vent cover. 
That is definitely true at the moment of cover release. However, the use of this equation gives too fast 
calculated displacement of the inertial vent cover as compared to experimental displacement recorded 
by Höchst and Leuckel (1998).
Several phenomena affecting inertial vent cover displacement were examined, including drag effects of 
the moving cover, air cushioning effects of the vent cover on its constraints, and vent cover jet flows 
affecting the pressure distribution on the internal vent cover surface (Molkov et al., 2003). The results 
of the drag effect and air cushioning effect analyses suggested that these phenomena were insufficient 
to account for the experimentally observed displacement of the circular inertial vent cover. Only the 
vent cover jet flows effect provided the successful modelling of the relationship between pressure forces 
generated by a deflagration and the motive behaviour of a translating inertial vent cover.

the following general form of the second Newton’s law is applied

. The drag 
force was added to the right-hand side of equation (10-35). It was found that a drag coefficient CD well 
over 1000 would be required to properly match the model displacement predictions to the experimental 
data. However, the literature clearly indicated that a circular plate perpendicular to the flow should have 
a drag coefficient, CD, of 1.1–1.2, see e.g. (Haberman and John, 1988). A review of the available literature 
further corroborated these values. 
Air cushioning effect
The air cushioning effect between vent cover and damping material (Höchst and Leuckel, 1998) was 
estimated next. The potential for air cushioning, affecting the motion of a translating cover, occurs when 
the cover translation is restricted. If the cover is constrained by a frame including an arrester consisting 
of a solid piece of material, then air between the cover and the frame may act as a cushion, slowing the 
cover velocity as in experiments by Höchst and Leuckel (1998).

In determining the pressure distribution above the cover in the cushion the pressure at the edge of 
the vent cover R0 is atmospheric pressure, pa. According to the Bernoulli equation, at some radius r 
the pressure on the external surface of the vent cover, pe(r,t), relative to its value pe(0,t) at the centre of 
external surface of the cover, where the velocity is equal to zero, is

where the first factor is the cover area, the second is the dynamic pressure, and the last could be denoted as 
a coefficient for air cushioning, CC , by analogy to the drag coefficient, CD, for the drag force. Substituting 
for L(t) in terms of R0, the results show that CC ≤ 1 at L ≥ 0.35R0 (approximately). Utilising the value 
given by equation (10–48) for a gap distance L of 0.1R0, CC only reaches 12.5. In fact, CC would only reach 
the sort of values disclosed by the original backfit only for gap distances between cover and damper of 
0.01R0 or less, and a value of 100 at approximately L = 0.035R0. CC only reaches values of 1000 or greater 
when L(t) = 0.011R0, within the last 3% of the total available travel distance. Over most of the vent cover 
travel distance, CC is much lower, only reaching 100 when L = 0.035R0. As a result, over most of the vent 
cover travel path, the drag coefficient associated with the cushioning effect is significantly less than 1000.

Thus, drag and air cushioning effects alone cannot account for the observed behaviour of the vent cover 
displacement.
Jet effect
The idea of the jet effect is as follows. The vent cover obstructs gases escaping from the vessel. Some 
time after a vent release is initiated, a jet forms under the circular cover. As a result, the gas velocity 
vector changes its direction by 90°. The pressure force acting on the moving cover, f(t), can be found 
by integration

where p(r,t) is a pressure acting on the bottom surface of the vent cover at radius r at moment t, pa is 
the atmospheric pressure, R0 is vent cover radius. 
Using the Bernoulli equation, the total pressure at any point of the internal surface (vessel side) of the 
vent cover can be written as composed of the static pressure, p(r,t), pushing the vent cover, and dynamic 
pressure, rur
2(t)/2, where the vector of ur(t) is parallel to the vent cover surface as gases escaping the 
vessel are turned 90° to form the jet beneath the cover. The total pressure at the centre of the vent cover 
is equal in our model to the transient pressure in the enclosure, p(t), as the velocity at the centre of the 
vent is equal to zero (stagnation point). The total pressure at any point of bottom surface of the vent 
cover is constant. Hence, one can write for three points, i.e. at the centre of the vent cover, its edge and 
at any arbitrary radius r the following equation

As a result one can conclude that the pressure force on cover when jet is formed is only half the pressure

for when calculating distance that explosion debris (missiles) could be thrown from an accident scene.

Deflagrations
10.3.3.4. Scaling of vent cover inertia
The phenomenon of the double pressure peak in vented gaseous deflagrations with vent opening pressure of 
relief panel above 7.5 kPa has been well established since the beginning of research at 1950th. It seems that 
Cubbage and Simmonds (1955) were the first who made the statement that inertia of the vent panel, at least 
over the range of conditions of their tests, had no effect on the second pressure peak. It was demonstrated 
then by Zalosh (1978), for tests in a 0.19 m3 vessel with the same vent area but different vent release pressures, 
that the second peak pressures were almost identical, even though the first peaks differed by a factor of 2.5. 
The phenomenon has been explained theoretically in our paper (Molkov, 1999b). The mentioned conclusion 
by Zalosh (1978) is expected to be correct only in cases when the vent cover is opened fully before the 
completion of deflagration. Experimental results on vented deflagration in a small-scale duct with ignition 
at rear wall have shown that the phenomenon of independence of the second pressure peak on the first 
one does not work always (Ibrahim and Masri, 2001). The case of central ignition in an enclosure with the 
ratio of the smallest to the largest sizes less than 1:3 is considered here. We will employ the phenomenon 
of independence of the second pressure peak on the vent cover release pressure in our further calculations.
Cubbage and Marshall (1973) suggested a formula for the maximum explosion pressure at the first 
pressure peak that appears after the release of the inertial vent cover

where K is the vent area coefficient (ratio of the area of enclosure cross section to the area of relief); and 
w is the inertia of vent cover, kg/m2. This equation is based on experiments in chambers of volumes up 
to 30 m3 using a variety of fuel gases to maximize the range of burning velocity. Unlike the Cubbage 
and Simmonds (1955) formula for freely lying horizontal relief panels, this latter correlation was devised 
from the experiments with relief panels that were positively fixed and had to be physically broken by 
the overpressure in order to create an open vent (Pv is larger than about 2 kPa). 
The fact that the overpressure is proportional to the square 
2
u
S  of the burning velocity, and not to 
u
S , 
leads to some overestimation of the deflagration pressure for mixtures with 
u
S  > 0.5 m/s. On the basis of 
experiments with such mixtures, British Gas (1990) recommended that the coefficient in the correlation 
should be reduced from 0.023 to 0.007. There is even an opinion that this equation (Cubbage and Marshall, 
1973) can be applied with confidence to empty rooms of volumes up to 200–300 m3 (Lautkaski, 1997).
Let us consider enclosures able to withstand internal overpressure not more than 1 bar. It means that 
the first of the two equations of the vented deflagrations (Molkov, 2001b) can be used to calculate the 
second pressure peak. Hence, for initial pressure in the enclosure equal to atmospheric we can write

where Brt is the turbulent Bradley number (see “Vent sizing technique” section for notations). For the 
overpressure at the second peak to be less than 1 bar the turbulent Bradley number has to be equal to 
2 or greater.

Deflagrations
To author’s knowledge there is no reasonable relationship that would calculate the upper limit of the 
cover inertia dependent on the enclosure volume, the vent size, the mixture characteristics and the 
venting generated turbulence. A cost-efficient design of deflagration mitigation system implies that the 
vent area is equal to its lower limit and the inertia may be equal to its upper limit. The first pressure 
peak value, which depends on vent cover inertia, has to be equal to or less than the second peak value, 
that depends on venting area. 
The upper limit for the inertia of a vent cover can be derived from this assumption after simple calculations 
with two equations above and presented in the form

where the burning velocity,
u
S , has been multiplied on the turbulence factor, c,as a conservative measure.
Let us calculate the upper limits for the vent cover inertia of enclosures of different volume of 0.1, 10, 
100, and 1000 m3 for the following model conditions. Let us assume for simplicity that enclosures have 
a cubical form, and a relief panel is mounted in one side only and has an area enough to ensure the 
reduced pressure 30 kPa. Let us assume further that for all enclosures the vent cover release pressure is 
equal to Pv=1.03 bar and near-stoichiometric propane-air mixture is used as a fuel (
u
S =0.31 m/s; 
iE
=7.9; 
u
γ =1.365; 
XL
F =335 m/s). 
These values of reduced pressure and vent release pressure have been used to determine the value of 
the turbulent Bradley number Brt=3.4 by the first of the two equations of the conservative form of vent 
sizing correlation (Molkov, 2001b). The turbulent Bradley number is the same for all cases. The DOI 
numbers, c/m, were calculated by the corresponding correlation (see section “Vent sizing technique”). 
The values for the turbulence factor were calculated from the DOI numbers with a characteristic value 
of the discharge coefficient m=0.6 for all enclosures. The vent areas F, and hence the respective ratios  
F/Acs, were calculated by the application of the conservative form of the vent sizing correlations (Molkov, 
2001b) descrived in detail here in the section “Vent sizing technique”. General initial and intermediate data 
and the results of calculation of the upper limit of the vent cover inertia for different enclosures are given in 
Table 10–1.

Deflagrations
Results of calculations shown in Table 10–1 demonstrate that the upper limit of the vent cover inertia 
depend strongly on the enclosure volume (for the same reduced deflagration pressure of 30 kPa in thios 
particular case). Nevertheless all vent covers are of 100% “efficiency”, i.e. fully opened before deflagrative 
combustion withing enclosure is finished. The same vent cover material can be “heavy” for small-scale 
vessels and “light” for large-scale enclosure. For example, the density of glass is about 2470–2560 kg/
m3 and hence the inertia of panes with thickness in the range of 2–5 mm constitutes 5–13 kg/m2. Such 
inertia practically has no influence on the value of the first pressure peak in empty room-size enclosures 
and enclosures of bigger volume without initial turbulence. However, glass is unacceptable for use as 
a vent cover material for enclosures with volume of about 0.1 m3 or less. On the other hand, we have 
calculated that the upper limit of the inertia for the vent covers in large-scale enclosures of volume about 
1000 m3 is about 800 kg/m2 even if the estimate is conservative. This value is well above those from 0.5 
to 20 kg/m2 that are under discussions for implementation into international standards.
10.3.3.5. Concluding remarks
The theoretical model of vented gaseous deflagration with non-inertial vent covers or initially opened vents by 
Molkov and Nekrasov (1981) has been extended to include multiple vents that can be either inertial or inertia-
free. Modified dimensionless governing equations of explosion dynamics have been derived. Modelling of 
inertial venting devices motion has been demonstrated for the case of translation panels, spring-loaded 
covers and hinged doors. Experimental data for hydrocerbon-air vented deflagrations are reproduced well. 
There is no experimental data on vented hydrogen-air deflagrations with inertial vent covers.

Deflagrations
Vent cover jet effect, originally discovered for translating panels was further confirmed for hinged doors. 
In all cases the satisfactory model predictions were obtained after taking into account the jet effect of the 
escaping gases on the vent cover surface. The calculated values of the explosion overpressure transients 
and the cover displacement transients are in good match with their experimental values published by 
Höchst and Leuckel (1998) and Wilson (1954). The determined empirical coefficients Ajet and Cjet assume 
plausible values, thereby confirming that the modelling of vented deflagration dynamics with inertial 
vent covers is reasonable and the CINDY code could be used as a predictive tool in safety engineering. 
10.3.4.	
 Vent sizing technique
Deflagration venting is the most widespread and cost-effective “explosion” mitigation technique. It 
reduces deflagration-incurred pressure to an acceptable level by venting gases out of an enclosure through 
a vent or number of vents of sufficient area during the deflagration. Design of explosion vents may be 
based on the vent sizing correlations or application of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 
In general, the vent sizing formulas of NFPA 68 standard (2007) and its European version EN 14994 
(2007) are not applicable to hydrogen because of its high KG index. Indeed, the vent sizing area formulas 
adopted by NFPA and EN standards are only applicable for a value of KG inferior or equal to 550 bar-m/
sec. As shown in Fig. C.1 of Annex C of the NFPA 68 (2007), the KG index of hydrogen increases with 
volume. For instance, the KG index of hydrogen rises from 550 bar-m/sec for a volume of 0.005 m3 to 
780 bar-m/sec for a volume of 10 m3. This simply means that the NFPA 68 (2007) vent sizing approach 
for hydrogen-air mixtures is not applicable for volumes larger than 5 L.
The dimensionless correlation for vented gaseous deflagrations was suggested for the first time by Molkov 
(1995) and was updated several times following validation against a wider range of experiments with 
hydrocarbon-air and hydrogen-air mixtures (Molkov, 1995; Molkov et al., 1997a; Molkov et al., 1997b; 
Molkov, 1999a; Molkov et al., 1999; Molkov et al., 2000; Molkov, 2001; Molkov, 2002, Molkov et al., 
2008a). This list includes the correlation for hydrocarbon-air vented deflagrations at elevated initial 
pressures (Molkov, 2001a). 
The conservative form of the correlation (Molkov, 2001b) created to meet the requirements of the CEN/
TC 305 expert group led by Kees van Wingerden who drew up the EN 14994 (2007). Unfortunately, 
by unknown to author reasons, the novel technique was not included in the final published version of 
the European standard EN 14994 (2007). Later, the innovative vent sizing methodology for hydrogen-
air deflagrations (Molkov et al., 2008a) has been included into the European Installation Permitting 
Guidance for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Stationary Applications (HYPER, 2008), and Biennial Report 
on Hydrogen Safety (BRHS, 2009).

Deflagrations
The technique by Molkov et al. (2008a) presented in this book is designed for hydrogen-air vented 
deflagrations only. In this section the comparison of experimental data on vented hydrogen-air 
deflagrations with predictions by the innovative vent sizing technique (Molkov et al., 2008a) and NFPA 
68 (2007) is presented. The predictions of the NFPA 68 (2007) were calculated using the value KG=550 
bar-m/sec. Experimental configurations included spherical and cylindrical vessels as well as a tunnel. 
Hydrogen concentrations were in the range 10–30% by volume. The vent sizing methodologies which were 
previously validated compared against experimental data on vented explosions in enclosures of volumes 
from 1 m3 (Pasman et al., 1974) to 6 m3 (Kumar et al., 1989) were updated to include new experimental 
data on uniform 40 m3 volume hydrogen-air deflagrations in a 78.5 m length tunnel (Sato et al., 2006).
10.3.4.1. NFPA 68 (Edition 2007) standard for vent sizing and its limitations
It worth noting that both standards, i.e. NFPA 68 (2007) and EN 14994 (2007), use equations by Bartknecht 
(1993) that have a limited range of applicability as opposite to the vent sizing technique (Molkov et al., 
2008a) that applicable throughout the whole range of possible deflagration conditions.
The equation for high-strength enclosures, i.e. enclosures capable of withstanding reduced pressure 
(deflagration pressure in vented enclosure minus atmospheric pressure) of more than 0.1 bar, is

where F is the vent area, m2; KG is the deflagration index, bar-m/sec; Pred is the reduced pressure, bar 
gauge; V is the volume of enclosure, m3; Pstat is the static vent activation pressure, bar gauge. We use this 
equation, not equation for low-strength enclosures, as all experimental data available for inter-comparison 
of different vent sizing techniques have reduced pressure above 0.1 bar.
Bartknecht’s equation (10–59) has a very limited application range. It is applicable only for reduced 
pressures of more than 0.1 bar and less than 2 bar, static vent activation pressures of less than 0.5 bar, 
initial pressure before ignition of less than 0.2 bar, enclosures with length-to-diameter ratio of less or 
equal to 2, and a deflagration index KG below 550 bar-m/sec. There is no information in NFPA 68 (2007) 
on how equation (10–59) was validated for volumes of up to 1000 m3.
Due to the limitation of KG≤550 bar-m/sec Bartknecht’s equation is not, strictly speaking, applicable to 
hydrogen-air mixtures since all the available values of KG for hydrogen are above 550 bar-m/sec (see 
Figure C.1 in NFPA 68, 2007). The current “consensus” for application of the NFPA 68 (2007) standard 
to hydrogen is to use Table E1 of NFPA 68 (2007) with a value KG=550 bar-m/sec for hydrogen in order 
to calculate the vent area using Bartknecht’s equation. It is clear that such an approach ignores the 
quite strong dependence of KG on enclosure volume, and hence does not account for the dependence 
of vent area on mixture reactivity, i.e. hydrogen concentration. The predictions of vent size or reduced 
pressures would be significantly overestimated in many situations and would therefore affect the cost of 
a deflagration mitigation system.

where 
#
V  is the dimensionless volume, V#=V/(1 m3). The “old” value of empirical coefficients e=10 and 
g=0.33 were obtained by calibration of the DOI number correlation (10–63) against experimental data 
on vented hydrogen-air explosions in enclosures of 1m3 (Pasman et al., 1974) and 6 m3 (Kumar et al., 
1989) volume only (Molkov, 2001b). 
Later (Molkov et al., 2008a) the DOI number correlation has been upgraded to apply to further tests by 
Kumar et al. (Kumar et al., 1989) and larger scale tests on deflagrations in a 37.4 m3 uniform hydrogen-
air mixture10 m long in the center of a 78.5 m tunnel (Sato et al., 2006). The inclusion of these new 
experiments into the validation set has affected the DOI number correlation (10–63) through the 
modification of two empirical coefficients only, i.e. “new” values e=2 and g=0.94, to comply with larger 
scale experiments by Sato et al. (2006).
The procedure for calculating the vent area for an empty enclosure fully filled with a quiescent hydrogen-
air or enclosure with insignificant influence of obstacles is as follows:
1. Calculate the dimensionless reduced explosion overpressure πred = Pred/Pi;
2. Determine the dimensionless static activation pressure πv = (Pstat + Pi)/ Pi;
3. Calculate the dimensionless pressure complex

the expansion ratio for the suitable hydrogen-air mixture (by volumetric fraction of hydrogen in 
air). For instance, for stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture at NPT, the following values can be used 
for the purpose of vent sizing: Ei=6.88, Su0=1.96 m/s (Lamoureux et al., 2003; Tse et al., 2000). The

10.3.4.3. The innovative vent sizing technique versus Bartknecht’s equation
The innovative vent sizing technique (Molkov et al., 2008a) has no inherent limitations compared to 
the empirical equation by Bartknecht used in NFPA 68 (2007) and EN 14994 (2007). In particular, the 
reduced pressures can be calculated over a range from close to zero up to the maximum deflagration 
overpressure in a closed vessel. The technique is applicable to mixtures of different fuel-air compositions.

Deflagrations
The prediction capabilities of two vent sizing methodologies are compared against three sets of 
experimental hydrogen-air deflagrations. The first set of experiments (“K” series in Table 10–2) was 
carried out by Kumar et al. (1989) in 2.3 m diameter spherical vessel of 6.85 m3 volume vented through 
a 3 m long and 45 cm diameter duct. Both the vessel and the duct were filled with a hydrogen-air 
mixture. An initially closed vent of diameter 15 cm, 25 cm or 45 cm was mounted at the end of the duct 
to separate the combustible mixture from the atmosphere. The reported vent relief overpressure was less 
than 10 kPa and this value was accepted for calibration of the correlations. Hydrogen concentration was in 
the range 6–20% by volume. However, the reproducibility of the experiments was good only at hydrogen 
concentrations above 10% by volume. The ignition source was located in the centre of the vessel, near 
or far from the venting duct. Experiments were carried out at an initial pressure near-atmospheric and 
a temperature of 22 °C.
The second set of two experiments (“P” series in Table 10–2) was performed by Pasman et al. (1974) in 
a 0.95 m3 cylindrical vessel of 0.97 m diameter and 1.50 m length. A flange was located at the back of 
the vessel to accommodate a rupture membrane. The hydrogen-air mixture was ignited in the centre of 
the vessel. Experiments with a stoichiometric (29.6%) hydrogen-air mixture were performed with two 
different vent areas of 0.3 m2 (0.62 m diameter) and 0.2 m2 (0.50 m diameter). The initial pressure in 
the vessel was equal to 101.8 kPa and the temperature was 281 K.
The third set of experiments (“SRI” series in Table 10–2) was performed in a 78.5 m long tunnel with a 
height of 1.84 m and horseshoe shape cross section area of 3.74 m2 (Sato et al., 2006). Uniform 15, 20 
and 30% by volume hydrogen-air mixtures of 37.4 m3 volume (10 m long clouds) were prepared in the 
middle of the unobstructed tunnel and ignited at the centre of the tunnel at floor level. The quantities 
of hydrogen in the 30%, 20% and 15% hydrogen-air clouds were equal to 1 kg, 0.667 kg and 0.5 kg 
respectively. 
An additional experiment with obstructions was carried out (Sato et al., 2006) only for the case of a 
30% hydrogen-air mixture. Mock “vehicles” of size LxWxH=940x362x343 mm were used as obstacles. 
The separation distance between the obstacles was equal to a “vehicle” length. The blockage ratio for 
this type of obstacle is 0.03. Sato et al. (2006) concluded, based on the experimental observations, that 
there was no difference between the maximum overpressures generated by hydrogen-air explosions in 
the tunnel without and with obstacles. The uniform mixture deflagrations in the tunnel were considered 
as vented deflagrations in the following interpretation: the volume of uniform hydrogen-air mixture is 
taken as the “enclosure volume” and the “vent area” of such a “vented enclosure” is equal to the double 
cross sectional area of the tunnel.

A comparison between the experiments and the predictions made by the Bartknecht’s equation from 
current standards and the vent sizing technique (Molkov et al., 2008a) is presented in Table 10–2. The 
innovative vent sizing technique remains conservative across the complete range of experimental data 
available and predicts vent size and reduced pressure significantly closer to experiments compared to 
predictions using NFPA 68 (2007) and EN 14994 (2007). Predictions made using Bartknecht’s equation 
occasionally overestimates the experimental data considerably. Indeed, for test K10-15R the vent area 
is over predicted by a factor of 25 (2435%) and the reduced pressure is significantly over predicted by a 
factor of 228 (22807%). In other cases, e.g. test P1-C, the methodology applied in standards demonstrates 
non-conservative character and under predicts by -45% the vent area and by -64% the reduced pressure.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Table 10–2. Comparison between experiments and predictions by the vent sizing correlations and Bartknecht’s equation (NFPA 68, 2007).
The vent sizing technique (Molkov et al., 2008a) demonstrates its advanced capability to predict explosion 
pressure during vented deflagration of uniform initially quiescent hydrogen-air mixture not only in vessels yet 
in vessels with venting ducts and in large scale tunnels, including in the presence of obstructions with a small 
blockage ratio. In all cases it predicts experimental data better than the current standards (see Table 10–2).
10.3.5.	
The inverse problem method 
In the early studies of vented gaseous deflagrations (Yao, 1974; Pasman et al., 1974) only one parameter, i.e. 
the turbulence factor c, was used to “tune” theoretical pressure transients in attempt to match experimental 
pressure-time curves. As a consequence of this “restriction”, the reproduction of experimental data 
was poor and unexplainable in many cases. This in turn was making impossible the generalisation of

Deflagrations
Since the first paper of author on vented gaseous deflagrations (Molkov and Nekrasov, 1981) it has been 
proved that more reasonable agreement between theoretical and experimental pressure transients could 
be achieved if the second unknown in advance theoretical parameter, i.e. the generalized discharge 
coefficient m, is “tuned” along with the turbulence factor c during experimental pressure–time curve 
processing. 
The inverse problem method has been applied widely in our research to find two parameters, i.e. c and 
m , which are characteristic for particular experimental conditions. The inverse problem method is the 
only available technique for investigation of macro- and micro-scale phenomena that are not accessible 
for direct assessment. The method was routinely applied by changing parameters c and m until the best 
reproduction of recorded pressure in achieved. The approximation that both adjustable parameters, c 
and m, are constants during the course of a particular deflagration usually works well. 
The generalized discharge coefficient m is not only the discharge coefficient in a common sense as a part 
of the standard orifice equations. It has been shown during processing of experimental data on vented 
deflagrations by that the generalised discharge coefficient m can be more than 1 or less than widely 
accepted value 0.6 for orifices. The explanation of this “weird” observation is in fact very simple. The 
standard orifice equations, where the discharge coefficient is applied, are derived in the assumption of 
zero velocity within the vessel. This is valid for small holes in large vessels, and is not valid when vent 
area is comparable with cross-section area of vented enclosure. To compensate the use of the orifice 
equations in conditions when they cannot be strictly applied, the inverse problem method yields higher 
than usually accepted values of m even higher than 1. Contrary, values less than m =0.6 can be generated by 
the inverse problem method when for example vent ducts are used in the deflagration mitigation system.
It has been demonstrated that deflagration overpressure correlates not just with turbulence factor, c, 
yet with the deflagration–outflow interaction (DOI) number, c/m. The DOI number can reach a value 
of about c/m =20–30 for vented hydrocarbon-air deflagration of an initially quiescent mixture in an 
unobstructed enclosure of volume 4000 m3 (Molkov et al., 2000).
10.3.6. Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue for vented deflagrations 
The fundamental Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue for vented deflagrations that was for the first 
time formulated by Molkov et al. (1993) is discussed in detail in this section. The Le Chatelier-Brown 
principle analogue for vented deflagration states that the gas dynamics of combustion in a vented vessel 
responds to external changes in process conditions in such a way as to weaken the effect of the external 
influence. In spite of differences between the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of hydrocarbon-air 
and hydrogen-air systems, they both obey the same general regularities for vented deflagrations, including 
the Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue and the form of the deflagration–outflow interaction (DOI) 
number correlation (Molkov et al., 2000).

The application of the zero isocline method to the system of governing equations describing vented 
deflagration phenomena, it is easy to obtain a simple formula for the dependence of the dimensionless

(10–65)
This theoretically derived equation practically reproduces the empirical correlation for vented 
deflagration with the only difference being the value of exponent “2” not “2.5”. Let us demonstrate that 
this general principle is applicable for both hydrocarbon-air and hydrogen-air systems and should be 
taken into account by safety engineers for the design of reliable explosion protection systems and during 
investigations of accidents with gaseous deflagrations in equipment and buildings.
It seems obvious from equation (10–65) that an increase of the vent area, F, by two times would decrease 
the deflagration reduced pressure, pred, by four times. However, the application of equation (10–65) to 
estimate the deflagration overpressure, pred, is not straight forward as suggested. According to the Le 
Chatelier-Brown principle analogue, the increase of vent area, F, is always (!) accompanied by an increase 
of the deflagration–outflow interaction number, c/m, to weaken the effect of the “external influence” 
(increase of vent area). 
For example, for propane–air mixtures in experiments by Pasman et al. (1974), the twofold increase of vent 
area is accompanied by an increase of 1.57 times in c/m (Molkov et al., 2000). For hydrogen-air mixtures 
in experiments at similar conditions, a 1.5 times increase of the vent area is accompanied by a 1.25 times 
increase of c/m; in the experiments by Kumar et al. (1989), a ninefold growth of vent area was accompanied 
by an increase in c/m of 2.79 times for a 10% hydrogen-air mixture and 2.93 times for a 20% mixture. 
Moreover, in the experiments of Harrison and Eyre (1987) in a 30.4 m3 enclosure, a 2.06 times increase 
of vent area was practically compensated by a 1.87 times increase of c/m. One likely reason for this is 
the stronger effect of external deflagration on the internal deflagration turbulence, c, and the generalised 
discharge coefficient, m, with the increase of vent area in experiments by Harrison and Eyre (1987). 
As a result of the Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue, the effective increase of the vent area in this 
experiment, which is equal to F/(c/m), is often much less than would be expected. In this particular case, 
the effective increase of vent area is just 2.06/1.87=1.1 (10% only), and not as much as 2.06! We believe 
that this example explains why an increase of vent area is not always effective in engineering practice to 
mitigate deflagrations to a level of pressure an enclosure can withstand. 
Some vented deflagration parameters like position of the ignition source and vent release pressure do 
not usually have significantly effect, excluding situations when external deflagration has strong influence 
(coherent deflagrations) or vent cover inertia is important.

Deflagrations
Other examples of manifestation of the Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue are as follows. The large 
decrease of the generalised discharge coefficient m by 2.25 times with the vent diameter increase from 
15 to 45 cm, due to the influence of losses in the vent duct in experiments by Kumar et al. (1989), 
was accompanied by a 1.12 times decrease in the turbulence factor c. From the other side, a 1.5 times 
increase of c in experiments by Yao (1974) was compensated partially by a 1.25 times increase of in the 
generalized discharge coefficient m. 
Another example of the universality of the Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue is related to the 
burning velocity. A sixfold increase of initial burning velocity Sui, when hydrogen concentration in air 
changes from 10% to 20% by volume, is accompanied by a slight, but nevertheless a 1.15 times decrease 
of the turbulence factor c. The important feature of the Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue for 
vented deflagrations follows from the examples given above and has to be especially emphasized: the 
compensation action is always weaker than the primary action.
Very simple general physical ideas underlie the principle being discussed. Indeed, it is easy to imagine 
that an increase of vent area with all other conditions the same would increase the disturbance of the 
flame front and hence increase the value of the turbulence factor. It is expected that a growth of the 
turbulence factor induces an increase of m due to a higher velocity of flow in a vent (it is well known 
that the discharge coefficient grows with flow velocity). Similarly, a decrease of m could be a reason for 
a decrease of c due to a relative decrease of the outflow velocity.
It has been demonstrated (Molkov et al., 1997b) that the principle is also valid for obstructed enclosures. 
This underlines the universality of the Le Chatelier-Brown principle analogue for vented deflagrations.
10.4.	
Large eddy simulation (LES) of large-scale deflagrations
Considered above lumped parameter models are one-dimensional and have limitations in prediction 
of gaseous deflagration dynamics compare to three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
models. The limitations include deflagrations in enclosures with complex geometry, large length to 
diameter ratio, internal obstacles, etc. It is very difficult to apply one-dimensional models to simulate 
deflagration dynamics in a system of enclosures or series of vessels, or coherent deflagrations (Molkov 
et al., 2006b) when the role of external deflagration cannot be ignored. One-dimensional models also 
have a limited ability to describe heat losses to enclosure walls, as they don’t identify the real flame front 
position relative to walls and obstacles, especially in complex geometries. Finally, lumped parameter 
models cannot be used to simulate transitional combustion processes like deflagration-to-detonation 
transition (DDT).
CFD is the recognised powerful tool to model and simulate fundamental and applied problems of 
hydrogen safety. This is supported by the ever-increasing performance of hardware and software. However, 
implementation of CFD into practice requires thorough validation of numerical simulations against 
experimental data (AIAA, 1998).

Deflagrations
LES is promising for deflagration simulation as it avoids time averaging and allows better prediction of highly 
non-isotropic turbulent flows and large-scale flame-flow interaction at the resolved level (Vervisch and 
Veynante, 2000; Hawkes and Cant, 2001). Large length-scales and small flame stretch rates are characteristic 
of accidental gaseous deflagrations, unlike those in many turbulent flames in other engineering applications 
(Bradley, 1999), e.g. industrial combustors and furnaces, internal combustion engines, etc.
The LES model does not assume a priori an isotropic turbulence throughout the whole calculation 
domain and doesn’t require solving additional differential equations for turbulence parameters. The LES 
model is able to partially resolve the flame front wrinkling at scale of several cells and the rest has to be 
modelled on the sub-grid scale (SGS) level. 
Hydrogen safety engineering requires contemporary tools such as CFD that are able to simulate problems 
at a real scale of tens of meters and are thoroughly validated against large-scale experiments. The LES 
technique is generally recognised as fundamentally stronger as compared to Reynolds Averaged Navier-
Stokes (RANS), whose vitality is caused mainly by an affordable computational cost for practical flow 
applications compared to conventional LES. Hundreds of RANS models have been developed, ranging 
from simple algebraic models to the advanced differential Reynolds Stress Transport Models. Nonetheless, 
the hopes that a universal, i.e. applicable to arbitrary turbulent flow, RANS turbulence model of whatever 
complexity will be created sometime are now lower than ever before (Strelets, 2003). This pessimism is 
caused by realising the crucial importance of the “coherent” structures observed in most turbulent flows 
of practical interest. In LES of non-reacting flows the transport processes of interest are affected by the 
resolved, large-scale motions, and there is a cascade of energy, dominantly from the resolved large scales, to 
the statistically isotropic and universal small scales. LES may provide a more reliable turbulence model than 
RANS especially if there are large-scale unsteady motions. The quantities of interest and the rate-controlling 
processes are determined for non-reacting flows by the resolved large scales. In turbulent combustion at high 
Reynolds and Damkohler numbers, the picture is quite different (Pope, 2004). The essential rate-controlling 
processes of molecular mixing and chemical reaction occur at the smallest scales which are much thinner 
than the resolved scales (Peters, 2000). Hence, these processes have to be modelled.
10.4.1.	
Physical requirements
Depending on fuel and mixture properties, the outward propagating spherical flame front remains 
laminar up to a radius of the order of some centimetres. Then cellular structure appears on the flame 
surface. Afterwards flame becomes wrinkled. A wide spectrum of instability wavelengths, from several 
millimetres to the flame front radius, gives rise to a fractal-like flame wrinkling (Bradley, 1999). The 
development of the cellular structure leads to an increase of the flame front area, which, in turn, leads to 
growth of the combustion rate and, eventually, through wrinkled flame to the self-turbulising regime of 
the flame front propagation. In near stoichiometric initially quiescent hydrogen-air mixture the transition 
from laminar to self-similar fully developed turbulent regime of flame propagation happens at distance 
1.0–1.2 m from the ignition source (Gostintsev et al., 1988). Thus, character and structure of the flame 
front, propagating in an initially quiescent mixture, changes with flame radius (Bradley, 1999).

Deflagrations
Selective diffusion, effects of hydrodynamic and other premixed combustion instabilities on flame 
propagation velocity usually take place at scales comparable with a laminar flame from thickness of the 
order of fractions of millimetre. These phenomena cannot be resolved in CFD simulations of large-scale 
problems of several meters to hundreds of meters due to limitations on mesh size in large calculation 
domains. The effect of these combustion instabilities has to be modelled rather than resolved. This is 
done in our case by accounting for these different physical phenomena through the turbulent burning 
velocity model.
Large eddy simulation (LES) is an approach to numerical simulations of reacting flows which provides 
the instantaneous resolved field and explicitly computes the large structures of the flow, allowing a better 
description of the turbulence-combustion interaction (Hawkes and Cant, 1999; Poinsot and Veynante, 
2001; Chakravarthy and Menon, 2001). 
Originally LES was developed for non-reacting flows. It is worth noting that various models for the 
combustion reaction rate based on Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach or sub-grid scale 
closures for LES feature strong similarities (Vervisch and Veynante, 2000).
A classical spectrum of isotropic flow turbulence decaying with eddy size in non-reacting flow is not 
strictly speaking applicable to large-scale combustion problems. A number of physical phenomena 
affecting the turbulent burning velocity, e.g. the turbulence generated by flame front itself and selective 
diffusion, act at scales much smaller compared to typical for hydrogen safety problems cell size of tens of 
centimetres. Moreover, this small-scale phenomena drastically affect the growth of the total flame front 
area and, given a limited computational power of modern computers, cannot be currently resolved at 
real accident scale of tens and hundreds of meters. The only way is the SGS modelling of the phenomena. 
10.4.2.	
Numerical requirements
There is a numerical requirement to a minimum number of computational cells through the any numerical 
“front”, e.g. flame or shock wave. The flame front thickness of at least 4 control volumes of rectangular 
grid was recommended by Catlin et al. (1995). For tetrahedral unstructured grids 4–5 points through 
the numerical flame front thickness can be “collected” at a distance equal to 2–3 edges of tetrahedral 
control volume. It means that LES can resolve elements of a flame front structure with a size larger than 
at least 4-6 edges of the tetrahedron. Smaller sub-grid structures can only be modelled.
The performance of LES on tetrahedral unstructured grids was studied by Jansen (1997), where the 
simplest filter, i.e. top-hat filter, was found to be the most successful. Kaufmann et al. (2002) recommended 
unstructured grids for LES applications in complex geometries. The LES model used in Ulster is of 
numerical type, as defined by Pope (2004) for a case of equivalency between LES filter and cell size. The 
model does not include an “artificial, i.e. non-physical parameter D” (Pope, 2004) applied in some LES 
models in a source term of the progress variable equation.

Deflagrations
Unfortunately, it is not feasible to resolve 80% of scales of turbulent eddies for large-scale problems of 
tens of meters as usually accepted for “standard” LES, especially for reacting flows. Indeed, a difference 
of physical scales is at least five orders of magnitude whereas only two-three orders of largest scale 
resolution is currently feasible in simulations (based on number of equally sized control volumes in a 
calculation domain 106-109). 
10.4.3. Governing fluid flow equations
The governing equations, employed here for LES, were obtained by filtering the following three-
dimensional instantaneous conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy for compressible 
Newtonian fluid and are described in (Makarov and Molkov, 2004)

In the laminar flamelet regime chemical kinetics enters the combustion system only through its influence

Various models for the combustion reaction rate feature strong similarities (Vervisch and Veynante,

Besides, the method treats the flame front movement and the effect of merging interfaces naturally 
without additional computational cost.
LES explicitly resolves the flame front wrinkling on a mesh scale. However, unresolved effects of different 
combustion instabilities affecting turbulent burning rate at the sub-grid scale (SGS) should be accounted 
using the SGS “turbulence” factor 
SGS
Ξ
, which is a multiplier to the laminar burning velocity and includes 
by definition effects of different physical mechanisms influencing premixed combustion. Apparently, the 
smaller the control volume size used the larger the fraction of the flame front wrinkling resolved explicitly 
in simulations and, thus, the smaller the SGS turbulence factor. In the limit of the fine enough grid and 
small scale problem the SGS wrinkling factor can be taken as 
0.1

where N is chosen from the consideration of the flame front thickness (N≥1). This approach has a potential 
to decrease the flame front thickness due to the faster change in the progress variable value and, at the 
same time, preserving the total mass burning rate, because the integral of 
N

across the flame front 
thickness is always equal to unity regardless N value. Choosing the value of N it needs to keep in mind that 
too high value of N can lead to unacceptably thin flame front and numerical instabilities in solution process.

It should be noted that being the result of the processing of experimental pressure-time curve by the 
lumped parameter model, the burning velocity Su0 and overall thermokinetic index e incorporate all effects 
of combustion instabilities on the burning velocity. At the same time, the cellular structure (wrinkling) 
of the flame front will be explicitly partially resolved in LES. It means that the effect of cellular structure 
on combustion rate will be accounted for with “excess”. Thus, the simulated deflagration dynamics can 
be expected to be faster than the experimental pressure transient at accepted given values of Su and e. 
Unfortunately, it was impossible to find values of Su and e for stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture for 
elevated initial temperature of 100oC.
The composition of the burned mixture was calculated using a thermodynamic equilibrium model 
(Kee et al., 2000) under isohoric conditions, i.e. the internal energy is constant, and taking into account 
21 species. The constant value of the heat of reaction, “averaged” through the whole deflagration 
process, was used in simulations (Makarov and Molkov, 2004). It was determined as a difference of 
internal energies of unburned mixture and combustion products at initial temperature of experiment,

and aforementioned properties were assumed to be independent of pressure.

According to Groff (1982), for stoichiometric propane-air deflagration the onset of cellular structure due 
to hydrodynamic instability occurs at the flame Reynolds number about 104 when the flame radius is 
0.056 m. If this critical value is accepted as universal and valid for hydrogen-air flame then the cellular 
structure would onset at the flame front radius

lean hydrogen-air mixtures can be “wrinkled” earlier by the selective diffusion phenomenon (higher 
diffusion of hydrogen that results in local redistribution of hydrogen concentration in air close to the 
wrinkled flame front).

10–14. At this stage the characteristic size of the resolved cells reached 0.35 m with the average flame 
front radius of about 1.05 m.

Figure 10–14. The numerical snapshot of resolved flame cellular structure: Case 4, t=44.4 ms.
Development of the resolved cellular structure in simulations leads to an increase of the flame front area 
and, thus, to an increase of the mass burning rate. The resolved wrinkling factor can be calculated as: 
b
C
F
F
5.0
=

Ξ
, where 
5.0

F
 is the area of iso-surface c=0.5, and 
b
F  is the area of the imaginary sphere 
of the same volume as the volume inside of simulated iso-surface 
5.0
=
c
. The resolved in simulations 
flame front wrinkling factor is growing with time and reaches values 1.03 and 1.09 in Case 1 and Case 
2 respectively. The higher wrinkling factor for Case 2 in comparison with Case 1 is, apparently, due to 
the finer grid, which provides a better resolution of the flame front.
The simulated flame thickness 
ff
∆
 was calculated as the volume between iso-surfaces of the progress 
variable c = 0.01 and  c = 0.99, divided by the area of the iso-surface 
5.0
=
c
. It is convenient to normalise 
the simulated flame front thickness using the size of initial cell edge 
=
∆ 0.07m. The variation of the 
front thickness normalised in such a way, expressed in an equivalent number of the original control 
volumes, is shown in Fig. 10–15.

In simulations the combustion was initiated not from the point ignition source as in experiment, but 
by near spherical pre-ignited region, which means that the simulation results should be adjusted using 
the time of flame propagation through the pre-ignited region. Theoretically the flame front radius at 
the initial moment is zero and at the initial stage of combustion, when the dependence of the burning 
velocity on pressure rise can be neglected, the flame front velocity is constant and equal to 
0
0 E
Su
 
(
0
E  – expansion coefficient, 
b
u
E
ρ
ρ
=

), and the flame front radius grows linearly. The correction 
times were obtained by imposing the simulated flame front radius with its analytical dependence after 
the flame separated from the pre-ignited region. As a result, extra time 3.75, 4.0, 3.75 and 4.5 ms were 
added to the original simulation time in Cases 1–4 respectively.
The analysis of the flame front thickness is meaningful only between the moment when numerical flame 
propagation is established after the ignition, and the moment when iso-surface c = 0.01 contacts the 
wall for the first time. Figure 10–15 demonstrates that the use of one level of solution adaptive mesh 
refinement, i.e. the decrease of characteristic control volume size by two times, reduces the simulated 
flame front thickness by about two times two as expected. Application of the modified gradient method 
(N=2) decreases the flame front thickness further by about two times, which is close to the size of the 
original control volume edge size.
There are some consequences of the flame front thickness reduction. In particular, the time between the 
moment when iso-surface c=0.01 touches the vessel wall and the moment when combustion is completed 
changes from 5.7 ms (Case 1) and 4.4 ms (Case 2), both N=1, to 1.5 ms (Case 3) and 1.9 ms (Case 4), 
both N=2, respectively.
It is worth mentioning that in unstructured tetrahedral grid the computational cells are oriented randomly 
and the simulated flame front still occupies about four control volumes even for the modified gradient 
method (N=2). Not less than four computational cells were required for the resolution of the premixed 
turbulent flame in study by Catlin et al. (1995) also. It can be presumed that if the simulated flame 
front thickness would decrease below this value, which is in agreement with one of the main numerical 
requirement to simulation of propagating “discontinuities”, can result in a slower flame front propagation. 
This can be explained by the fact that for “sharp” numerical front the integral of (
)
c
grad
 across the 
numerically flame front will be below 1 due to the insufficient smoothness of c profile. This is supported 
by results in Fig. 10–16 and Fig. 10–17.

Thus, it is not a “wonder” that the lumped parameter model provided the best agreement with the 
experimental pressure-time curve except the final part, where experimental pressure drops due to the 
heat losses to the vessel walls. This allows us to use data obtained with the lumped parameter model 
at the interval t=0-46 ms for verification of the LES model against data not measured in experiment.

The maximum explosion pressure, obtained in the LES simulations, is in the range from 625.5 kPa 
to 627.8  kPa for all considered cases. This is in agreement with the theoretical value of the 
deflagration pressure calculated according to thermodynamic equilibrium model for closed vessel 
(p=623  Pa), and slightly lower than the maximum pressure according to the lumped parameter 
model (p=648.4 Pa). This close agreement is due to the fact that the adopted heat of reaction was 
calculated at isohoric conditions, which is lower than the heat of reaction for the isobaric process

After t=46  ms the second derivative of the experimental pressure transient changes its sign from  
positive to negative because of heat losses into the vessel walls. In lumped parameter model calculations 
and LES simulations the heat losses were neglected. This is why the second pressure derivative  
in the lumped parameter model calculations is always positive. However, in the LES simulations the 
second pressure derivative changes its sign at the end of combustion. The reason is as follows. Once the 
leading edge (c=0.01) of the thick numerical flame front touches the wall (see Fig. 10–16), its thickness 
decreases with time. This causes a decrease in the mass burning rate as the integral of (grad c) over the 
rest of numerical flame front is now below 1. The decrease of mass burning rate affects the pressure 
dynamics. The earlier flame front attachment to the vessel walls is observed for the standard gradient 
method (N=1).

The best agreement with the experimental pressure dynamics is for Case 4 (see Fig. 10–16). However, 
as was mentioned earlier, the LES model used the burning velocity at initial conditions and the overall 
thermokinetic index that were obtained by the inverse problem method from the same experimental 
data assuming the ideally spherical shape of the flame front. This means that the values of initial burning 
velocity and overall thermokinetic index implicitly account for the cellular structure developing in the 
deflagration progress. On the other hand, the LES results have demonstrated that at least a part of cellular 
flame front structure was explicitly resolved in simulations. Thus, the effect of cellular structure was 
accounted more than once. This implies that in Fig. 10–16 the LES pressure transient has to be moved 
to the left of the experimental curve. 
The finer grid will provide numerical resolution of smaller and smaller elements of the cellular structure. 
This will cause faster flame propagation due to larger flame surface and further move of the simulated 
pressure curve to the left of the experimental pressure record. This statement is supported by simulations: 
Case 1 and Case 2 (see Fig. 10–16). Unfortunately, investigation of further grid refinement on pressure 
dynamics and flame front structure was not possible due to the demanding computer resources, required 
by such simulations in 2004. Finally, the deviation of simulated pressure transients from experimental 
is less than 10% and can be treated as acceptable.
10.4.5.3. Flame propagation velocity
The flame front propagation velocity was calculated as the propagation velocity of the iso-surface 
5.0
=
c
 
(Makarov and Molkov, 2004). Data on the flame propagation is not available from the experiment (Kumar 
et al., 1983). By this reason the simulation results were compared against results of the lumped parameter 
model (see Fig. 10–17). The initial period of the flame propagation and its final part from the moment 
when the leading flame edge (c = 0.01) touches the vessel wall to the complete burnout of the mixture, 
are excluded from the analysis.
The lumped parameter model gives nearly constant flame front propagation velocity of 23 m×s-1 during 
the most of combustion process excluding the final stage of the deflagration. At the end of the deflagration 
the flame propagation velocity reaches 26 m×s-1 as a result of competition between an increase of laminar 
burning velocity due to pressure growth and a decrease of propagation velocity when flame approaches 
wall and the propagation velocity tends to be equal to the burning velocity. The effect of pressure built-
up on the burning velocity for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture deflagration in closed vessel is 
stronger than the effect of flame deceleration close to the vessel wall. 
The numerically simulated flame front propagation velocity is in a qualitative agreement with the 
results of the lumped parameter model, i.e. the flame propagation velocity increases at the final stage of 
combustion. The faster growth of the LES flame front propagation velocity compared to results obtained 
from the lumped parameters model (see Fig. 10–17) can be explained by explicit partial resolution of 
the developing flame cellular structure.

10.4.6. Cellular structure of large-scale premixed flames
The regularities of cellular structure development for initially quiescent stoichiometric hydrogen-air 
deflagration propagation from a central ignition source in a large-scale 2.3 m diameter spherical vessel 
(Kumar et al., 1983) are described in this section. The observed in experiments with hydrocarbon-air 
mixtures growth of cell sizes with flame radius as result of hydrodynamic instability is reproduced 
numerically for hydrogen-air mixture. 
The minimum resolved in the simulations (Molkov et al., 2004c) size of the flame cells is of the order 
of the simulated flame front thickness that which is about 3 control volume edges. The use of 3.5 cm 
mesh size in simulations around the flame front allows to resolve cells with sizes as small as about 10 
cm. The “resolved” fractal dimension of the wrinkled flame front surface grows and reaches at the end of 
deflagration a value of 2.15 that is close to the lower limit of the fractal dimension observed in experiments.
For hydrogen-air flames at normal temperature and pressure stable preferential-diffusion conditions 
are observed at fuel-equivalence ratios above roughly 0.7 (Aung et al., 1997). The neutral preferential-
diffusion condition shifts toward fuel-rich conditions with increasing pressure (Aung et al., 1998). It 
could lead to the development of preferential-diffusion instability at pressures above 4 atm when one 
could expect that chaotically irregular surfaces will develop. However, a stabilising effect of temperature 
growth could be assumed as the burning velocity is increasing with temperature. That could compensate 
for the destabilising influence of the growing pressure. 
The influence of preferential diffusion is taken into account in our LES model through the value of burning 
velocity. The only remaining reason for the developing of the flame front wrinkling in simulations is 
hydrodynamic instability.
The resolved by LES wrinkled flame front is shown in Fig. 10–18 for four different moments: 6.6, 13.6, 
27.3, and 36.6 ms after ignition. The vessel wall is given as an outer thin circle. It is clearly seen that 
the flame front has an evolving in time cellular structure. At the moment t=6.6 ms the flame front 
radius is about 26 cm, and cells are not yet pronounced enough. It is easy to observe the appearance 
and evolution of the fractal structure of the flame surface in time by following the development of two 
randomly chosen cells, indicated by arrows in Fig. 10–18, to demonstrate that they grow and then split 
according to theoretical predictions.

Figure 10–18 shows that the cell size grows in time, and along with this growth the further cells of 
smaller size are created on primary cell surface, giving a rise to a fractal-like flame wrinkling. In spite 
of the fact that small-scale perturbations of real flame front below LES filter are not resolved, one can 
identify the cascade of different cell sizes in Fig. 10-18. This numerical result is in agreement with the 
fractals theory and flame stability analysis by Bradley (1999).
The numerical flame front wrinkling factor is a function of the simulated flame front thickness. The 
thinner the flame front the smaller resolved wrinkles. Resolved fraction of the cell size spectrum increases 
with flame front radius and more plausible simulation results can be expected at the end of the deflagration. 
The flame front radius at four different moments, the respective values of the resolved flame front wrinkling 
factor and the fractal dimension are given in Table 1 for simulation results with the average grid size

. This is close to the fractal dimension values D=2.14–2.24 reported for turbulent premixed 
combustion in Bunsen-type burners by Gulder et al. (2000). A wider range of experimental values of 
fractal dimension D=2.11–2.36 has been cited for various premixed combustion applications by Gulder 
(1990). In spite of LES limitation to resolve flame front wrinkling below filter width the obtained values 
of fractal dimension at the end of combustion are reasonable. Yet, unresolved sub-grid scale flame 
wrinkling needs to be modelled in the LES SGS combustion sub-model. The observation that simulated 
fractal dimension is increasing with time, i.e. with the flame front radius, could be related to the growing 
fraction of the resolved scales of wrinkles with radius rather than a physical phenomenon.

The range of cell sizes resolved in simulations is given in Fig. 10–19. The cell sizes were obtained from the 
numerical flame front snapshots using 3 independent expert measurements and then weight-averaged. 
The scatter between the highest and the lowest values of the cell sizes are shown by solid vertical lines. 
It is easy to see that simulated flame front cellular structure obeys the theoretical conclusion by Bradley 
(1999) that the size of cells at outer cut-off increases with the flame radius and the size of inner cut-off 
(about three CV sizes in this case) remains practically constant.

Figure 10–19. Experimental (methane-air and propane-air, Bradley et al., 2001)  
and simulated (hydrogen-air) dependencies of flame front cell sizes on radius.  
Vertical lines show the range of cell sizes resolved in simulations.
Weight-averaged cell sizes of simulated flame front are indicated by “square” symbols in Fig. 10–19 and 
grow up to 20 cm at radius of about 1 m. The author is not aware of any large-scale experimental results 
on hydrogen-air flame propagation, where flame front cell sizes were analysed. Figure 10–19 demonstrates 
that LES results for hydrogen-air mixture are in quantitative agreement with the experimental data on 
cell sizes obtained for large-scale hemispherical methane-air and propane-air explosion flames (Bradley et 
al., 2001). The experiments (Bradley et al., 2001) were part of the SOLVEX (Shell Offshore Large Vented 
Explosions) research program and were performed in 547 m3 volume vessel. Experimentally obtained cell 
sizes for both methane-air and propane-air mixtures at flame radii from 1 to 2.5 m were close to each 
other and are shown in Fig. 10–19 by triangles and circles respectively. Bradley et al. (2001) commented 
that when flame front radius reached approximately Rff=2.5 m, the flame front propagation couldn’t be 
considered as non-vented and hemispherical anymore, and the average cell size decreased drastically.
The fact that cell sizes simulated for hydrogen-air mixture are similar to observed experimentally by 
Bradley et al. (2001) for mixtures with quite different chemistry and fine flame front structure might be 
an evidence that the hydrodynamic instability is responsible for self-acceleration of large-scale explosion 
flames rather than other effects. This conclusion encourages the LES model application to simulation of 
accidental combustion at larger scales.

10.4.7.  The nature of coherent deflagrations
The nature of coherent deflagration phenomena in a vented enclosure-atmosphere system is analysed in 
this section. The work is based on experimental observations of SOLVEX programme in the empty 547-
m3 vented enclosure and consequent analysis of the test by large eddy simulations (LES). A comparison 
between simulated and experimental pressure transients and dynamics of flame front propagation inside 
and outside the enclosure gave an insight into the nature of the complex simultaneous interactions 
between flow, turbulence and combustion inside and outside the enclosure (coherent deflagrations). It 
is revealed through LES processing of experimental data that the substantial intensification of premixed 
combustion occurs only outside the empty SOLVEX enclosure and this leads to steep coherent pressure 
rise in both internal and external deflagrations. The external highly turbulent premixed combustion does 
not affect burning rate inside the enclosure. There is only one ad hoc parameter in the LES model, which 
is used to account for unresolved sub-grid scale (SGS) increase of the flame surface density outside the 
enclosure. The LES model allows reaching an excellent match between theory and experiment for coherent 
deflagrations in the empty SOLVEX facility. The hypothetical mechanism of combustion intensification 
in the atmosphere is discussed and the quantitative estimation of the model ad hoc parameter is given.
CFD simulation of deflagrations is a demanding task due to the non-linearities and range of time scales 
involved in combustion process in turbulent compressible flows (Hjertager, 2002). One of unresolved 
questions is the nature of interaction between internal premixed combustion during vented deflagration 
and so-called “external explosion” of a flammable mixture pushed out of the enclosure after ignition and 
then partially diluted by atmospheric air on the contact surface (Molkov et al., 2006b).

10.4.7.1. “External explosions”
In 1957 Swedish scientists carried out the first experimental study emphasising the important role of the 
external explosion during vented deflagration (Report of committee for explosion testing, 1958). It was 
reported that in some cases the maximum explosion pressure outside the 203-m3 enclosure exceeded 
the maximum overpressure inside of the enclosure.
Solberg et al. (1980) further highlighted hazards associated with external explosions. They observed 
that the flame front propagation velocity could reach 100 m/s in the direction perpendicular to the 
axis normal to the vent during vented deflagration in a 35 m3 vessel. The flame propagated up to 30 m 
beyond the vent, even though the vessel was only 4 m long. Cooper et al. (1986) discussed the role and 
conditions for onset of pressure peak inside an enclosure due to external explosion. Harrison and Eyre 
(1987) came to the conclusion that for “large vents, where the internally generated pressures are low, 
the external explosion can be the dominating influence on the internal pressure” and that this influence 
“could be very important for large volume low strength structures such as buildings or off-shore modules”.
Harrison and Eyre (1987) simultaneously with Swift and Epstein (1987) suggested that the influence of 
external explosion on the internal pressure dynamics is to decrease the mass flow rate through the vent. 
Theoretical analysis by Molkov (1997) based on the processing the experimental data by Harrison and 
Eyre (1987) confirmed that the turbulence factor inside the enclosure was practically not affected by the 
external explosion. Instead, the substantial decrease of the generalised discharge coefficient in the lumped 
parameter model, and thus the mass outflow, was found for tests with distinct external combustion. It 
was concluded that the decrease in a pressure drop on the vent due to combustion outside the enclosure 
is the main reason for reduced venting of gas outside enclosure.
Catlin (1991) studied the scaling of external explosions. He found that external overpressure increases 
proportionally to the velocity of combustion products emerging from the vent and igniting the fuel-air 
mixture in a starting vortex outside the enclosure. Later Catlin with colleagues (1993) developed an 
engineering model to assess the hazard from external explosion based on the previous study by Catlin 
(1991) and validated against large scale experiments in enclosures of volumes up to 91 m3.
Puttock et al. (1996) observed the external explosions during experiments in the SOLVEX facility with 
and without internal obstacles. It was reported that “the effect of the external explosion, giving the final 
peak pressure in pressure transients, is particularly marked in the case of an enclosure without internal 
obstacles, increasing the internal pressure by about a factor of four above the previous peak”. The effective 
epicentre of the external explosion, i.e. the centre of the fireball at the moment when the maximum 
pressure is measured in front of the vent, was only five meters in front of the vent. This is similar to 
observations by Solberg et al. (1980) and Harrison and Eyre (1987), who found that the centre of the 
external explosion was very close to the vent.

Former simulations of the SOLVEX test with internal obstacles by means of CFD (Watterson et al., 1998) 
over predicted the maximum pressure by two orders of magnitude and under predicted the time to the 
peak pressure by two orders compared to the experimental data. Fairweather et al. (1999) stressed that 
“improvements in the accuracy with which the combustion process external to the vessel is modelled” 
are required.
10.4.7.2. SOLVEX methane-air deflagration analysis
The SOLVEX facility (Fig. 10–20) is a large-scale enclosure of 547-m3 volume with sizes 
HxWxL=6.25x8.75x10.0 m and a vent HxW=4.66x5.86 m located in the centre of the HxW=6.25x8.75 
m wall. Experiments were performed with initially quiescent 10.5% methane-air mixture inside the 
enclosure ignited by a point source located at the centre of the wall opposite to the vent (Puttock et al., 
1996). There was no special agitation of air in the surrounding atmosphere before ignition. The vent 
cover was removed just before ignition. The SOLVEX test without obstacles inside the enclosure was 
chosen for simulations. The repeatability of experiments was excellent that makes them a reliable source 
of data for validation of the LES model.

Figure 10–22. Experimental pressure transients inside and outside the enclosure (Molkov et al., 2006b).
To facilitate a comparison between experimental and simulated flame propagation (snapshots) and 
pressure dynamics it was assumed that the appearance of the flame front in the vent (snap-shot A in Fig. 
10–21) corresponds to the first pressure peak on the internal pressure-time curve (t=923 ms). Indeed, 
it is well known that the first pressure peak inside the enclosure (time A in Fig. 10–22) is caused by 
the start of venting of combustion products (venting of gases with higher temperature, i.e. combustion 
products, is more efficient for reduction of pressure compared to venting of gases with lower temperature, 
i.e. unburned mixture).

The time of the first flame front appearance in the vent (frame A in Fig. 10–21) was identified 
approximately. This is because the piece of a plastic sheet, used to cover the vent and removed shortly 
before ignition, screened the flame. This is why the first flame appearance in Fig. 10–21A is seen at 
some distance from the vent. The movement of the piece of plastic film can be easily recognised through 
snapshots in Fig. 10–21.
The combustion outside the enclosure commences in moderate regime between frames A and B in Fig. 
10–21. A rapid intensification of combustion starts after the flame emerging from the enclosure reaches 
the vent edges (the instant between frames B and C). The external pressure reaches a maximum in a 
short time of about 70 ms after the intensification started (frame D). The maximum pressure inside 
the enclosure occurs shortly after 1103 ms (frame E). At 1137 ms (frame F) the pressure dynamics is 
at the decay phase. At 1203 ms (frame G) the pressure is close to its minimum at the negative pressure 
phase of the deflagration. The experimental video records show that there is still intense turbulent 
combustion, which proceeds at the top part of the vent. Frame H shows that at the final stage of the 
process the combustion inside the enclosure continues only at the lower part of the enclosure. This fact 
was confirmed by numerical simulations.
At the same moment when the pressure inside the enclosure starts to decrease due to more effective 
venting of combustion products compared to preceding venting of a heavier methane-air mixture (time 
close to A in Figs. 10–21 and 10–22) the pressure outside the enclosure starts to grow rapidly due to the 
initiation of turbulent combustion of the flammable mixture outside the enclosure (Fig. 10–22, A to B). 
The phenomenon is called coherent deflagrations as the steep rise of pressure inside the enclosure 
coincides with the pressure rise in the atmosphere. During this period video records demonstrate rapid 
intensification of combustion in a turbulent wake behind the vent edges outside the enclosure (time C 
in Fig. 10–22). 
There are no video records of what is happening with combustion inside the enclosure at this time. 
The nature of observed coherent deflagrations inside the vented enclosure and in the atmosphere is not 
obvious from the analysis of experimental data only. Harrison and Eyre (1987) pointed out that “there 
is a widely held belief that any increase in internal pressure that is not predicted by simple venting 
theory should be attributed to an increase in the combustion rate inside the chamber” yet “it is wrong 
to attempt to represent the peaks caused by external explosions in this way”. This means that Harrison 
and Eyre (1987) as well as Swift and Epstein (1987) and later Molkov (1997) dealt with experiments 
when the decrease in pressure drop through the vent was a leading phenomenon. However, Catlin et 
al. (1993) stated that “the combustion external to the enclosure can provide a source of overpressure 
and velocity which upon arrival at the vent can interact with the flame inside the enclosure to cause a 
marked increase in burning rate”.

Deflagrations
The main question that remains after the performed analysis of experimental observations is whether the 
rapid acceleration of combustion in the atmosphere during the empty SOLVEX test affects the burning 
rate of internal deflagration and if “yes” to what extent? 
10.4.7.3. Modelling and LES of SOLVEX methane-air deflagration
The deflagration flame front propagation was simulated using the progress variable equation and the 
gradient method was used for the model mass burning rate

The laminar burning velocity and the heat of reaction in simulations were dependent on the methane 
concentration in the flammable mixture. The combustion products composition did not vary with the 
methane concentration and were equal to those of the initial 10.5% methane-air mixture and led to a 
negligible error in the molecular mass and the specific heat capacity used in the model.
Figure 10–23 shows the calculation domain. It comprised the enclosure itself and a relatively large 
hemispherical area around the enclosure (R=60 m) to exclude the effects of boundary conditions on 
the external combustion and to accommodate the diverging pressure wave generated by the coherent 
deflagrations. The calculation domain was meshed using an unstructured tetrahedral grid, which allows 
meshing of arbitrary complex calculation domains and concentrating control volumes (CVs) locally in 
the area of interest reducing the total number of CVs. It does not have preferential directions compared 
to structured grids. The average edge size of CVs was 0.8 m inside and outside the enclosure where 
combustion occurred. The characteristic CV size was smoothly increased up to 23 m in the rest of the 
domain. The total number of CVs was 87,156 that is relatively moderate, keeping in mind the complex 
geometry and scale of the problem.

Boundary conditions used for simulations included: no-slip, non-permeable, adiabatic conditions on all 
walls and ground surfaces and non-reflecting flow conditions at the domain boundary at the atmosphere. 
At initial conditions the flammable mixture inside the enclosure and air in the atmosphere were quiescent, 
pressure was equal to atmospheric, p=101325 Pa, and temperature was equal to T=285K. The initial 
values c=0, Yf =0.061, Ya=0.939 were used inside the enclosure and c=0, Yf =0, Ya=1 in the atmosphere. 
Combustion was initiated by a slow increase of the progress variable in one CV at the centre of the rear 
wall over the first 50 ms.

Deflagrations
The direct application of the LES model to simulate coherent deflagrations in the empty SOLVEX facility, 
with the turbulence factor X=1, failed to reproduce experimental pressure dynamics in different locations 
inside and outside the enclosure. Carried out numerical experiments proved that only introduction of 
an ad hoc parameter to the model, accounting for unresolved increase of burning rate in the starting 
vortex region outside the enclosure, enables to reproduce experimental pressure transients of the coherent 
deflagrations (concurrent premixed combustion inside and outside the enclosure). 
Presented below results of numerical simulations were obtained with the turbulence factor X linearly 
growing in the model in the area outside the enclosure from its default value 1 to 2 during the interval 
of 100 ms following the flame front emerging from the edge of the vent. The reason for the introduction 
of this ad hoc wrinkling factor in the area of turbulent wake behind the vent edges is apparent: to resolve 
small-scale swirls generated in this region a much finer grid would be required compared to the applied 
grid with average cell size in the combustion area of 0.8 m. 
Figure 10–24 shows the simulated deflagration flame front propagation and locations of flammable 
mixture and methane concentrations outside of enclosure.

Figure 10–25. Simulated pressure transients of the coherent deflagrations inside and outside the enclosure.
The development of a simulated turbulent combustion zone outside the enclosure (Fig. 10–24) is similar 
to the experimentally observed (Fig. 10–21). The geometrical centre of the external explosion at the 
final stage of combustion (Fig. 10–24, frame H’) is at a distance of about 5–6 m from the vent, which 
corresponds to the experimental observations by Puttock et al. (1996). Formation of the vortex structure 
in the flammable mixture flowing out to the atmosphere through the vent is clearly seen in Fig. 10–24.
Simulated pressure dynamics of coherent deflagrations given in Fig. 10–25 matches experimental pressure 
transients (Fig. 10–22). Flame arrival time to the vent is very close to the experimental time.
The LES model reproduces the internal deflagration during the whole period of the coherent deflagrations 
development without introduction of any ad hoc parameter to describe complex interactions of flow, 
turbulence and combustion inside the enclosure. 
The internal pressure dynamics is reproduced in simulations for the whole period of combustion, 
including the first pressure peak associated with a start of combustion products outflow from the 
enclosure, the second pressure peak associated with the coherent external/internal deflagrations, and 
the negative pressure peak related to the momentum of expanding products of the “external explosion”. 
The amplitude of the negative pressure peak for simulated external explosion at a location 6.1 m outside 
the enclosure is about half that found in experiment.

Deflagrations
Combustion at the top part of the vent at the time 1203 ms (frame G in Fig. 10–21 and frame H’ in Fig. 
10–24) is not apparent in Fig. 10–24 yet simulations demonstrated that there is still flammable mixture 
at the top of the vessel at this moment. The explanation could be that Fig. 10–24 shows snapshots of the 
process in the centre-line vertical cross-section whereas experimental video records show combustion 
at the upper part of the vent originating from the top corners of the enclosure. 
Finally, there is a “residual” combustion at the bottom side of the enclosure (after the time 1203 ms 
in Fig. 10–24, frame H’) that gives rise to somewhat higher pressure in the enclosure compared to the 
outside pressure following the negative pressure peak.
The development of coherent deflagrations inside and outside the enclosure generates an outward 
propagating pressure wave. Pressure outside of the SOLVEX enclosure was measured by pressure gauges, 
installed at distances 6.1, 30.3, 53.9 m far from the vent along the vessel centre-line. Comparison of 
experimental pressure dynamics at 6.1 m and experimental maximum pressures at 30.3 and 53.9 m with 
simulated pressure dynamics at the same locations is shown in Fig. 10–26. The simulations provide an 
excellent agreement with experimental data.

Deflagrations
10.4.7.4. Concluding remarks
The phenomenon of coherent deflagrations in the SOLVEX empty facility-atmosphere system is analysed 
experimentally and numerically. The processing of experimental pressure transients inside and outside 
enclosure by the LES deflagration model underpinned important conclusions on the nature of coherent 
deflagrations. The formation of the starting turbulent vortex in the flammable mixture pushed out of the 
enclosure during the internal deflagration is a prerequisite for a subsequent intensification of turbulent 
combustion outside the enclosure. 
The rapid increase of the burning rate outside the enclosure commences not at the moment when the 
flame front emerges from the vent but after the flame front reaches the edges of the vent. The coherent 
steep pressure rise is observed both inside and outside the enclosure after this instance. The pressure rise 
in the atmosphere is a direct consequence of the highly turbulent deflagration outside the enclosure. At 
the same time there is no increase of the burning rate inside the enclosure. The pressure rise inside the 
enclosure is caused by the decrease of mass flow rate from the enclosure to the atmosphere due to the 
decrease of pressure drop at the vent as a result of intensive combustion of emerged flammable mixture 
in the atmosphere in front of the vent.
The ad hoc parameter should be introduced into the LES model to account for increase of the burning 
rate outside the enclosure due to generation of small-scale swirling structures in the flow downstream 
the vent edges that is unresolved in the simulations on a quite course grid with average control volume 
edge size in the area of combustion 0.8 m. The LES model correctly reproduces experimental pressures 
at different locations inside and outside the enclosure and the development of the deflagration in the 
atmosphere when the ad hoc parameter is gradually increased outside the enclosure from its default 
value of 1 to 2 in a time equal to the completion of the external combustion. The application of an ad hoc 
parameter inside the enclosure, or both inside and outside the enclosure, leads to inadequate dynamics 
of the coherent deflagrations (Molkov and Makarov, 2006c). 
10.4.8.	
Large-scale hydrogen-air deflagrations in the open atmosphere
The emphasis in combustion research for energy applications differs from that in accidental combustion 
research, e.g. hydrogen safety. Large flow turbulence, high flame strain rates and relatively small scales 
of inhomogeneous regions are characteristic for most combustion devices. These features can differ 
radically from that in large-scale unwanted deflagrations. The initial stage of flame propagation at 
accident often takes place in a quiescent or moderately agitated mixture in a quasi-laminar mode. While 
combustion research is mainly focused on the aspects of flame behaviour to increase the efficiency of 
burning, hydrogen safety research is focused on deflagration mitigation. Conventional models, used to 
design combustion devices, may not be appropriate to analyse large-scale deflagrations as regularities and 
physical phenomena for freely propagating accidental flames can be different from those for stabilised 
flames, e.g. burner flames.

Deflagrations
Theoretical considerations by Zeldovich et al. (1980) admit deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) of free 
spherical premixed combustion due to flame front instabilities and acceleration. Hydrogen-air deflagrations in 
unconfined conditions were studied experimentally by Makeev et al. (1983). A spark with energy of 1 J was 
used to ignite a mixture in the centre of a rubber balloon of initial volume 35 m3 or 86 m3 of diameter about 
4 m and 5.5 m respectively. Experiments in a 4 m diameter balloon demonstrated that flame front acceleration 
at the initial stage of combustion ceased and flame propagated with a practically constant velocity of 38 m/s 
in a mixture with 35% by volume of hydrogen in air. In a 5.5 m diameter balloon test the flame propagation 
velocity was continuously increasing to 105 m/s for the mixture with the same concentration of hydrogen. 
The authors (Makeev et al., 1983) concluded that the maximum velocity is increasing with diameter of initial 
cloud and for volume larger than 500 m3, diameter larger than 10 m, DDT is possible. In the same year 1983 
experimental studies of large-scale hydrogen-air deflagrations with hemispherical volumes of up to 2094 m3 
were performed in Germany (Pförtner and Schneider, 1983, 1984; Pförtner, 1985; Becker and Ebert, 1985). 
Tests were conducted with ignition sources of energy within the range from 10 to 1000 J in near stoichiometric 
hydrogen-air clouds with diameter of hemisphere up to 20 m. No DDT was registered.
Characteristics of a blast wave from unconfined deflagration differ from that of high explosives. For 
example, in a near-field the overpressure from the positive phase of gaseous explosion is much less 
compared to high explosives, while the duration of this phase is greater. In a far-field, pressure waves from 
deflagrations decay slower with distance from a source of initiation and cannot be described by means 
of the TNT-equivalence concept (Gorev, 1982; Dorofeev et al., 1995b). The TNT-equivalence concept is 
inadequate to describe the large amplitude of the negative phase of gaseous explosions (Dorofeev et al., 
1995b), which is larger than the positive phase amplitude for deflagrations (Gorev, 1982).

Deflagrations
Bradley (1999) suggested that in case of large-scale deflagration flames “the fractal analyses is probably 
valid because of the large length-scales and small flame stretch rates, unlike turbulent flames in many 
engineering applications where the flame stretch rate usually reduces the burning rate”. This statement 
is in line with the results of analysis of 20 unconfined gaseous deflagrations carried out by Gostintsev 
et al. (1988). They described the behaviour of spherical turbulent premixed flames propagation as a 
self-similar process in which a total flame front surface area grows R1/3 times faster (theoretical fractal 
dimension D=2.33) than surface of a sphere with the same radius. 
According to the fractal theory a ratio of the turbulent flame front area At to the area of the smooth 
laminar spherical flame Au0 is equal to

li can be accepted as a constant, the turbulent burning velocity St is a function of the average flame 
front radius R:

, where St0 is the turbulent burning velocity at radius R0. Gostintsev 
et al. (1988) reported that for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures a self-similar regime of flame 
propagation is established at critical radius of 1.0–1.2 m. After the critical radius the turbulent flame 
front surface is contorted and thus the fractal theory can be applied.
Different values have been proposed for the fractal dimension, D. Gouldin (1987) used D=2.37 adopted 
from Abdel-Gayed et al. (1984). A wide range of experimental values of fractal dimension D=2.11–2.36 
was cited for premixed combustion by Gulder (1990). Bradley (1999) suggested to apply the theoretical 
value D=2.33 for freely propagating flames. Gostintsev et al. (1999) suggested for self-similar freely 
propagating flames the fractal dimension in the range D=2.2–2.33. Gulder et al. (2000) reported the fractal 
dimension within the range D=2.14–2.24 for turbulent premixed combustion in Bunsen-type burners.
This section is devoted to further development of the LES model of large-scale deflagrations and validation 
of the model. Two combustion sub-models will be tested, one is based on the renormalization group (RNG) 
theory and another on the fractal theory. Numerical simulations will be compared against the largest ever 
performed experiment on stoichiometric hydrogen-air deflagration in 20 m diameter hemisphere in the open 
atmosphere GHT 34 (Pförtner and Schneider, 1983). The comparison will be carried out for flame radius, 
flame shape and pressure transients at different distances from the ignition source (Molkov et al., 2006a).
10.4.8.1. Largest hydrogen-air deflagration test in atmosphere
A series of experiments with near stoichiometric hydrogen-air deflagrations in unconfined hemispherical 
volumes was performed by Pförtner and Schneider (1983) in the Fraunhofer Institute for Fuels and 
Explosive Materials. The experimental conditions and maximum observed flame speed are presented in 
Table 10–4. The principal aim of these experiments was to investigate the dependency of flame propagation 
velocity on the hydrogen-air cloud size. Mixtures were ignited at the ground level inside the shell made 
of thin polyethylene (PE) film to exclude the effect of reflected pressure waves. Burnout of the cloud 
occurs approximately at two initial diameters that is approximately equal to the cubic root of the products 
expansion coefficient.

* – experiments with rhombus-shaped wire net over the hemispherical balloon (in GHT 34 test the rhombus-wire net was laid over 
balloon to compensate approximately 7500 N buoyant force).
Table 10–4. Experimental conditions and results for different tests (Pförtner and Schneider, 1983).
After burnout the peak deflagration overpressure decays in the form of pressure wave with positive and 
negative phases. The duration of the positive and the negative phases is independent of the distance for 
any given size of balloon. The amplitude of negative pressure peak was usually somewhat larger than that 
of the positive pressure phase and the negative phase being of shorter duration. Pförtner and Schneider 
(1983) for spherical sonic waves cited a theoretical result derived by Landau that at any distance the 
integral of overpressure in time should be equal to zero. This theoretical result complies with experimental 
records of the outward propagating pressure wave outside the combustion area (see pressure transients 
at distance 35 m and 80 m from the ignition point below). 
Processing of visual images of the flame propagation yielded a continuous increase in flame propagation 
velocity up to a maximum value, which was reached at a distance between the initial radius of the 
cloud Rhsph and 1.5 Rhsph. For initially quiescent stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture this upper limit was 
estimated as 125 m/s with a peak overpressure 13 kPa assuming the validity of the approach by Pförtner 
and Schneider (1983) based on simple turbulent combustion models of Damkohler and Karlovitz. The 
experimental results indicate that the flame propagation velocity approaches the upper limit with the 
increase of the cloud size.
In test GHT 34, with 29.7% by volume hydrogen-air mixture in a 20 m diameter hemisphere, the 
maximum flame propagation velocity was 84 m/s with the initial burning velocity estimated by Pförtner 
and Schneider (1983) as 2.39 m/s (the expansion coefficient of combustion products was calculated as 
7.26 with a density of combustible mixture 0.8775 kg/m3 and a speed of sound 397.3 m/s). Errors in 
velocity measurements were assessed as +5% without taking into account certain asymmetries in flame 
propagation. In the 2094 m3 hemisphere experiment, GHT 34, a rhombus-shaped wire net was laid over 
the hemispherical balloon which was fastened to the ground at 16 points to compensate buoyancy force.

In order to make the hydrogen-air flame visible in daylight finely ground NaCl powder was dispersed 
inside the balloon at the end of filling process to produce a yellow-coloured flame. Generally 10 to 12 
piezo-resistive Kistler pressure sensors (100 kPa range, natural frequency 14 kHz) were used. These 
were mounted in a steel case having a mass of 20 kg in a way that their pressure-sensitive surfaces were 
fitted flush with the surface of the ground and covered with a 2 mm thick layer of silicone grease on the 
membrane to avoid the influence of temperature and heat radiation. In addition a sensor, located at 5-m 
distance from the ignition source, was protected by means of a laminated plastic plate screwed to the 
steel casing and having an opening of 4 mm diameter in the middle. For the GHT 34 test an additional 
pressure sensor was installed at a right angles to the axis with main sensors and mounted on a vertical 
timber wall 1x1 m2 (head-on measurement). 
The deflagration pressure was measured at distances 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 6.5, 8.0, 18, 25, 35, 60, and 80 m from 
the initiation point. The mixture was ignited by pyrotechnical charges with total ignition energy 150 
J. The pressure transients of sensors inside the combustion products did not return to zero after the 
negative pressure phase, except for the sensor installed at 5 m. This can be attributed to the fact that the 
transducers were thermalized to high temperatures during the explosion. Since they did not remain at 
the temperature at which they were calibrated, they were no longer calibrated and did not return to the 
baseline. This is an indication that the protective measures taken by the experimenters to insulate these 
transducers were insufficient for this large test.

Figure 10–28 shows that the flame propagated in an almost hemispherical form. The balloon shell first 
stretched slightly outwards until it burst when the flame had reached about half of the original radius 
of the balloon 0.5R0.

10.4.8.2. Modelling and LES (RNG-Karlovits and fractal sub-models)
The dilution of hydrogen-air mixture by ambient air on the contact surface of the flammable cloud 
with the atmosphere was accounted for similar to our previous studies. The propagation of flame was 
simulated by the progress variable equation with the gradient method applied for the source term

. The gradient method allows decoupling between a physical requirement to keep the 
turbulent mass burning rate equal to 
t

ρ
 and a numerical requirement for a simulated flame front to 
occupy 4-5 control volumes, independent of a mesh size and a scale of a problem. Indeed, the integral 
of the source term throughout a numerical flame front thickness always gives a physically correct value 
for the mass burning rate per unit area, i.e. 
t
uS
ρ
, independent of the numerical flame front thickness.
As a result of the gradient method use, simulations of flame front propagation and pressure dynamics 
will not be affected noticeably, regardless of the fact that the structure and size of a numerical flame 
front are not actual characteristics of the real flame front. Furthermore, tackling problems of practical 
interest with a scale of tens and hundreds of meters, there is no chance to resolve a structure of real 
turbulent flame front, where for example the turbulence generated by flame front itself plays a role at 
scales comparable with thickness of laminar flamelets of the order of millimetre. Nevertheless, the giving 
up of a fine flame front structure resolution allows one to reproduce reasonably hydrodynamics of flows 
ahead and behind of the numerical flame front, overall flame propagation and deflagration pressure 
dynamics because the energy release in the flame front is kept physically correct.

The first model of turbulent burning velocity

Fractal combustion sub-model (R>R0)
The second combustion sub-model, applied at the stage of the LES model development in 2006 to simulate 
the open atmosphere hydrogen-air deflagration, is based on the fractal analysis of the freely propagating 
premixed flames, and was described by Makarov et al. (2007a). Following the conclusions of the fractal 
theory the burning velocity is modelled as

takes place at flame radii above the critical

. Hence, the fractal combustion sub-model can be 
applied with confidence only after that. 
It is important to note that the simulations of the transitional stage of the deflagration (flame radii

were performed by the RNG-Karlovits combustion sub-model. The value of burning velocity, extracted 
from the RNG-Karlovits sub-model at R=R0 for implementation in formula (10-83) of the fractal sub-
model, was calculated as 
0
R
tS
=6.44 m/s by the following procedure. The location of a simulated flame 
front, at any moment of time, was determined by the averaging of coordinates of all control volumes 
with values of the progress variable within the range c=0.01-0.99. At the moment when radius of the 
flame front became equal to R0 a total mass burning rate in the flame front was calculated. Then, to 
obtain the sought burning velocity, the mass burning rate was divided by the product of a combustible 
mixture density and the area of the hemisphere with radius R0. The obtained value 
0
R
tS
=6.44 m/s is by χ
=6.44/1.91=3.37 times larger compared to initial laminar burning velocity of 29.7% by volume hydrogen-

front itself and flow turbulence. The augmentation of burning velocity for radii

by the fractal combustion sub-model, equation (10–88), instead equations (10–86) and (10–87) in the

Numerical details
Initial temperature and pressure were taken as in the experiment 283  K and 98.9  kPa respectively. 
Hydrogen-air mixture and ambient air were quiescent at the moment of ignition, u=0. The progress

Ignition was modelled by increase of the progress variable from c=0 to c=1 in one control volume (CV) 
during a period Dt=22 ms calculated as a time of flame propagation through spherical CV equal by 
volume to the ignition tetrahedral CV. The value c=1 was kept in the ignition CV until moment 29 ms. 
No adjustment of simulation results in time (pressure transient shift along the time axis) was required 
with this procedure.
The calculation domain with sides LxWxH=200x200x100 m was created to simulate both the flame front 
and the pressure wave propagation. The characteristic size of the tetrahedral CVs in the flame propagation 
area (R≤22m) was about 1m and the characteristic size of the hexahedral CVs in the rest of the domain 
(R≤30m) was 4 m. The transitional area (22<R<30m) was meshed using tetrahedral mesh with CV size 
changing from 1 to 4 m. The total number of CVs was 294,296. 
The grid sensitivity analysis was conducted for the RNG-Karlovits combustion sub-model. Two similar 
grids with a characteristic CV size in the area of flame propagation 1.0 m and 0.5 m, respectively, were 
used. The difference in the flame front propagation dynamics, i.e. the growth of the flame front radius 
in time, was about 5%. This difference is due to better resolution of the flame front wrinkling by the 
hydrodynamic instability for a finer grid, which provides a larger mass burning rate and, thus, faster 
flame propagation.
The FLUENT 6.2.16 solver was employed as a platform for the realisation of the LES model. The double 
precision parallel version of the solver was used with explicit linearisation of the governing equations. 
The second order upwind scheme was used for convection terms and the central difference scheme for 
diffusion terms. 4-stage Runge-Kutta scheme was applied for time stepping. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy 
number was equal 
8.0
=
CFL
 to ensure stability. Simulation of real time of deflagration and pressure 
wave propagation up to 0.63 s takes about 6 days on a workstation IBM630 (12GB RAM, 2CPUx1.2GHz 
Power 4, 1CPU SPECfp=961).
Simulation results: flame shape
Figure 10-29 shoes the simulated flame front propagation for experiment GHT 34. Distinctive large-scale 
wrinkling of the flame front by the hydrodynamic instability can be seen. The cascade of characteristic 
wrinkles above a LES filter size, i.e. cell size in the numerical LES approach (Pope, 2004), of 1m are 
close in size to experimentally observed hydrogen-air flame wrinkles (Pförtner and Schneider, 1983).

Figures 10–30, 10–31 and 10–32 show a comparison between experimental results (test GHT 34) and 
numerical simulations. Experimental data on flame propagation dynamics are represented in Figs. 10–30

flame front is shown in Fig. 10–30a by hatched area with the leading flame edge depicted by solid line. 
At final stages of the deflagration the thickness of the numerical flame front is about 4 m which is close 
to experimental observations (Molkov et al., 2007a).

Both considered combustion sub-models reproduce the deceleration of flame at the final stage of the 
explosion. This deceleration is caused by dilution of the initial hydrogen-air mixture by ambient air and 
thus the decrease of the burning rate (see Fig. 10–31a). The deceleration of the numerical flame front 
is more pronounced compared to the experiment. This could be attributed to noticeably large cell sizes 
used in the simulations in the areas of mixture non-uniformity. Performing simulations on an adaptive 
grid in the area of large hydrogen concentration gradients could improve predictive capability of the 
model at final stages of the deflagration.

Deflagrations
For the RNG- Karlovits combustion sub-model the maximum deviation of the simulated leading flame 
front edge from the experimental one does not exceed 1 m. With this obviously “not bad” agreement 
between the LES model and the experiment, the acceleration of the real flame front is reproduced only in 
the initial stage of the deflagration. At later stages simulations give practically constant flame propagation 
velocity (Fig. 10–30a). 
The simulated pressure dynamics (Figs. 10–30, b-d) is close to experimental pressure transients at 
locations of properly functioning transducers at distances 5 m, 35 m, and 80 m. Both positive and negative 
phases of the pressure wave are reproduced by the numerical experiment, including arrival time, duration 
and decay of the pressure wave with distance. The amplitude of the positive phase of the pressure wave 
is reproduced in simulations exactly with a bit faster arrival time in a far-field. However, amplitude of 
the negative phase is up to 30% less than in experiment. The simulated rear front of the positive phase 
overpressure wave passes ahead of experimental one due to significantly stronger deceleration of the 
flame front in simulation at the end of the simulated deflagration compared to the experiment.
Simulation results of the flame front propagation for two cases, with fractal dimensions D=2.33 and 
D=2.22, are presented in Fig. 10–31a. The fractal sub-model reproduces the monotonic increase of the 
flame front propagation velocity similar to the experiment. Deflagration overpressure dynamics is shown 
in Figs. 10–31, b-d. The simulation with theoretical fractal dimension D=2.33 obviously over predicts 
both flame propagation and overpressure dynamics. During numerical experiments it was found that 
a best fit value for the flame propagation dynamics for the fractal sub-model is D=2.22. This is within 
the range D=2.20–2.33 reported by Gostintsev et al. (1988). One of possible reasons for the backfitted 
fractal dimension D=2.22 to be below the theoretical value 2.33 is a partial resolution of the flame front 
wrinkling structure by LES. Indeed, it was found that for spherical flames the resolved fractal dimension 
is within the range 2.02–2.15 (Molkov et al., 2004c). 
Along with a good agreement in prediction of the amplitude of the negative phase of the pressure wave 
the fractal sub-model over predicts the amplitude of the positive phase by up to 50%. The reason for 
over prediction of the positive pressure peak by the fractal model is not clear. This could be due to the 
effect of PE balloon on the pressure wave. Indeed, segments of a balloon could “consume” part of the 
energy in the pressure wave in the test. The effect of PE balloon segments is weakened at later stages 
and as a result the negative phase amplitude could be less affected.

5 m, 8 m, and 18 m, are shown in Fig. 10–32. Transducers located at 2 m, 8 m, and 18 m from the 
ignition source were affected by the combustion products as their pressure transients didn’t return back 
to atmospheric pressure after the explosion. Still, pressure readings from these transducers may be used 
for explosion analysis until time of flame arrival.

A distinctive sharp overpressure peak

 of about 10 kPa in the pressure transients followed flame 
propagation (see Figs. 10–32, b–c). The simulations reproduced an overpressure peak at the moment when 
the flame front arrived at the sensor’s location. Experimental pressure peak appears somewhat earlier 
compared to simulation results. This is in agreement with experimental data (Pförtner and Schneider, 
1983) where it was reported that the flame proliferates along the pressure measurement axis much more 
rapidly than in other directions. The fact of higher 
F

 at 5 m and 8 m transducers could be explained 
by the intensification of combustion after the balloon shell had burst when the flame reached about half 
of the original radius of the balloon 0.5R0. The underlying physical phenomenon could be Rayleigh-Taylor 
instability, when flame front is unstable to acceleration from a lighter to a heavier gas.

Concluding remarks
The LES model of large-scale accidental combustion is advanced further and applied to simulate the 
dynamics of the largest unconfined hydrogen-air deflagration ever performed Molkov et al., 2006a). Two 
combustion sub-models were applied to analyse experimental data, one derived from the RNG theory along 
with findings of Karlovits et al. (1951) and Gostintsev et al. (1988), and another from the fractal theory. 
The LES model demonstrates good convergence on different grids. The results of simulations vary by 
less than 5% for two unstructured tetrahedral grids with a difference in characteristic cell size of 2 times.
Formation and decay of the pressure wave are reproduced in simulations, including the experimental 
observation that a negative phase has shorter duration and higher amplitude compared to a positive phase.
There is more pronounced deceleration of simulated flame front at the end of the deflagration compared 
to the experiment. This is thought due to the course grid and affects slightly the duration of the positive 
phase of the pressure wave. Simulations on adaptive grid in the area of hydrogen concentration gradients 
would better reproduce experimental data.
In the RNG-Karlovits combustion sub-model the effect of flow turbulence on the turbulent burning 
velocity is taken into account by implementation of the Yakhot’s (1988) equation for the turbulent premixed 
flame propagation velocity, which does not include either adjustable parameters or empirical coefficients. 
The RNG-Karlovits sub-model reproduces initial flame acceleration yet gives practically constant flame 
front propagation velocity after that. The RNG-Karlovits sub-model is closer to experimental results in 
prediction of the positive phase but under predicts by up to 30% the negative phase amplitude.
The fractal combustion sub-model, that exploits the RNG-Karlovits sub-model until the critical radius 
R0, gives the best fit to the experimental flame propagation with a fractal dimension D=2.22, which is 
within the range 2.20–2.33 reported by Gostintsev et al. (1999) for large-scale unconfined deflagrations. 
Simulation with D=2.22 reproduces accurately the experimentally observed flame front acceleration 
during the whole process of deflagration, the negative phase of the explosion pressure wave and over 
estimates by up to 50% the positive phase. Higher pressure peak of the positive phase in simulation 
compared to experiment could be attributed to the effect of PE balloon. Simulations with theoretical value 
D=2.33 apparently over predicts both the experimental flame propagation and the pressure dynamics.
Numerical simulations partially resolve the flame front wrinkling caused by hydrodynamic instability. 
This contributes by a factor of the order of 1.1 to the flame propagation velocity. The flow turbulence in the 
RNG sub-model contributes by an additional factor of the order of 1.15 to the turbulent burning velocity. 
Fractals increase the flame surface area in the fractal sub-model by a factor of the order of (R/1.2)0.22 
depending on the flame front radius, e.g. 1.74 for flame radius R=15 m. Yet, the main contribution to 
the augmentation of the turbulent burning velocity is the turbulence generated by flame front itself 
(Karlovits et al., 1951) that is a multiplier of 3.6 to the initial laminar burning velocity for stoichiometric 
hydrogen-air mixture (Molkov et al., 2006a).

Both sub-models reproduce quite closely the experimental flame front propagation dynamics up 
to maximum 40 m diameter and pressure dynamics up to maximum available 80 m, i.e. at scales 
characteristic for hydrogen safety engineering problems. The agreement between numerical simulations 
and experimental data demonstrates the merits of the LES model for large-scale accidental premixed 
combustion. 
10.4.8.3. A series of deflagrations in the open atmosphere
The updated version of the LES model described above was applied to simulate a series of experiments 
by Pförtner and Schneider (1983) on near stoichiometric hydrogen-air deflagrations in hemispherical 
balloons of different radii: 1.53 m, 5.00 m, and 10.00 m. The main features of the LES model applied are 
published elsewhere (Molkov et al., 2007b).
The effect of flow turbulence on a turbulent burning velocity was modelled by the modified Yakhot’s

. Simulations with a fine enough mesh, sufficient to resolve 
flame propagation until the critical radius of the transitional stage R0, have demonstrated that value y=0.7 
is typical for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures. The transitional period of flame propagation 
from the ignition source until the critical radius for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures is accepted 
as R0=1.2 m (Gostintsev et al., 1988).
The increase of fractal surface of the turbulent flame with growth of its outer cut-off (flame radius)

Deflagrations
The difference of this turbulent burning velocity combustion model from the simple fractal model 
tested above is the application of the fractal model along with the Yakhot’s formula accounting for the 
flow turbulence. This is related to insufficient resolution of the fractal structure of turbulent flame front 
by the LES model when tackling large-scale problems. As a result the fractal’s sub-model becomes the 
contributor to the SGS level of unresolved physical phenomena, i.e. the term defined by equation (10–92) 
is a multiplier to the laminar burning velocity in the original transcendental equation for turbulent 
burning velocity by Yakhot (1988). 
Experiments
The LES model described above in this section was applied to simulate the following experiments by 
Pförtner and Schneider (1983): GHT 23, GHT 26, GHT 11, GHT 13, GHT 34*. Experimental parameters 
are given above in Table 10–4. A maximum positive peak pressure was constant within the combustion 
zone of approximate size 2Rb and decreased inversely proportional with distance outside this zone. 
In a far field the pressure wave propagated with a form and duration of positive and negative phases 
independent of the distance for each balloon size.
Three pressure peaks were identified by experimentalists in a positive phase of pressure wave. The balloon 
shell stretched slightly outwards until it bursted when the flame reached distance 0.5Rb. The first pressure 
peak Dp1 corresponds to the moment of bursting of the balloon shell. Pressure gauges inside the balloon 
recorded noticeable peak Dp1 because of pressure relief during bursting. After balloon shell bursting the 
flame front accelerates. The acceleration of the flame front gives rise to peak pressure Dp2 in outgoing 
pressure wave. The experimental report suggests that the flame front decelerates approaching shell 
fragments with subsequent reduction in pressure. After this the flame accelerates again and a pressure 
peak Dp3 is observed. Analysis of experimental records indicates that the pressure peak Dp3 could be 
attributed to the combustion of unburnt mixture flown outside the balloon shell fragments. For pressure 
sensors installed within the combustion area, the additional pressure peak Dpf, corresponding to the 
moment of flame passing over pressure sensor, is registered. Typical experimentally observed pressure 
peaks Dpf, Dp1, Dp2 and Dp3 are shown for test GHT 34 further in this section in Fig. 10–38.
Numerical details and ignition procedure
The area of combustion in calculation domain was meshed by tetrahedral control volumes (CVs), while the 
area of outgoing pressure wave by hexahedral CVs. A numerical grid for simulation of 1.53 m deflagration 
is essentially the same as for 5.0 m deflagration and was obtained by scaling with factor 3.268 (Fig. 10–33). 
Details of calculation domains and meshes used in simulations are given in Table 10–5. Initial temperature 
and pressure are those in experiments (see Table 10–4). The mixture is initially quiescent, u=0. Hydrogen 
mass concentration inside balloon area, R≤R0, is equal YH2=0.0287 (corresponds to volume fraction 29.7%) 
and YH2= 0 outside, R>R0, in all cases. The initial burning velocity 1.91 m/s is accepted for all simulations 
in this study. The ground boundary is modelled as non-slip, adiabatic, non-permeable surface. Boundary 
representing atmosphere is modelled by non-reflecting boundary conditions.

Ignition is modelled using a linear increase of the progress variable from 0 to 1 in one control volume 
(CV), located at the centre of a hemisphere at ground level. Duration for the increase of the progress 
variable was calculated as a time of laminar flame propagation over half of the ignition CV edge,

Simulated location of the flame front was identified by the leading edge of the flame front by averaging 
through CVs with values of the progress variable in the range c=0.01–0.10 similar to Molkov et al. 
(2006a). The simulated flame front radius starts from a size of one cell in which ignition is initiated. 
All simulations were performed with initial burning velocity 1.91 m/s for stoichiometric hydrogen-air 
mixture of 29.7% (Lamoureux et al., 2003), and the same fractal dimension D=2.20.

at 2.07, 2.87, and 4.95 m from the ignition source for 1.53 m radius hemisphere deflagration at tests 
GHT 23 and GHT 26 are shown in Fig. 10–34. Under prediction of negative pressure amplitude could be 
explained for example by fast condensation of a fraction of water vapour in combustion products when 
mixing with cold air radiation losses from high temperature products. Comparison between experimental 
(GHT26) and simulated peak pressures Dp2 and Dp3 is shown in Fig. 10–35.

Deflagrations
For the largest known hydrogen-air deflagration (test GHT 34) in 10.0 m diameter hemisphere the 
comparison between experiment and simulations (Molkov et al., 2007b) is shown in Fig. 10–38 and Fig. 
10–39. Pressure dynamics registered at distances 5 m, 35 m and 80 m from the ignition source is presented 
in Fig. 10–38. The model grid sensitivity was studied for test GHT 34. The original grid (“course” grid 
of 353,422 CV), used for this simulation, was then adapted in the vicinity of the flame front to decrease 
CV size twice. The model enables to simulate flame propagation dynamics on two grids with ratio of 
cell size equal to two with a difference below 10%. This complies with a requirement to LES models 
performance on different grids (Pope, 2004).

Deflagrations
Concluding remarks
The LES model of large-scale gaseous deflagrations (Molkov et al., 2007b) incorporates the turbulent 
burning velocity combustion sub-model based on interaction of three mechanisms, i.e. the turbulence 
generated by flame front itself, the fractal growth of turbulent flame surface area with scale, and the flow 
turbulence. The modified transcendental equation by Yakhot (1988) for the turbulent burning velocity 
includes the SGS wrinkling velocity instead of the laminar burning velocity, and the fluctuating velocity 
at the resolved level. 
The performance of the LES model has been compared against a series of near stoichiometric hydrogen-
air deflagrations in hemispherical polyethylene balloons of radius 1.53, 5.00, and 10.00 m with central 
ignition. Applied to simulation of all experiments the fractal dimension D=2.20 complies well with 
reported previously values of the fractal dimension. Taking into account that all simulations were 
performed with the same values of initial burning velocity 1.91 m/s and fractal dimension 2.20 the LES 
predictions can be assessed as close to the experimental data.
Simulations reproduced experimentally observed pressure peaks Dp2 and Dp3, which were attributed 
to effect of PE balloon by the experimentalists (Pförtner and Schneider, 1983). Indeed, experimental 
peak Dp2 is somewhat larger than simulated that confirms an influence of PE shell burst on the flame 
acceleration. Still, the presence of Dp2 in simulations should be understood.

10.4.8.4. Blast wave overpressure in the atmosphere
Gaseous deflagrations in the open atmosphere generate outgoing pressure waves. The acoustic theory

this formula is that the pressure wave peak depends on both the flame propagation velocity and the 
flame acceleration, especially at large radii. Deceleration of the flame front results in a pressure drop 
in the pressure wave. This formula states as well that the pressure wave decays inversely proportional 
to the distance from the ignition source. Author leaves the validation of this formula by the GHT34 
experiment to a reader.

LES of hydrogen-air deflagrations in a 78.5 m tunnel
The LES model previously validated against a series of deflagrations in the open atmosphere, including the 
largest known 20-m diameter deflagration, is applied in this section to reproduce experimental data on 20% 
and 30% hydrogen-air deflagrations in a central part of a 78.5-m long tunnel (Groethe et al., 2005). The model 
enables the transient modelling of deflagration dynamics with a laminar flamelet burning velocity which 
alters with mixture composition, pressure, and temperature. The turbulent burning velocity is computed 
using Yakhot’s transcendental equation for premixed combustion. Yakhot’s equation is essentially modified 
to account for the transitional phenomena of turbulence generated by the flame front itself and the fractal 
structure of the turbulent flame surface at unresolved sub-grid scale (SGS) level. 
The LES model (Molkov et al., 2008b) reproduced experimental data for both mixtures in an unobstructed 
and an obstructed tunnel. The simulations gave insight into the dynamics of flame propagation and the 
pressure build up within and outside of the tunnel. The LES model enabled the analysis of phenomena 
which were not reported in the experimental study. For example, a significant increase in the maximum 
explosion overpressure was observed in the vicinity of obstacles due to obstacle side-on pressure wave 
reflection in later stages of the event.

Deflagrations
The hydrogen economy has become a part of our everyday life. Characteristic hazards, associated with 
different kinds of hydrogen applications, have to be first understood in order to prevent or mitigate 
accidents. Hydrogen fuelled buses and cars are already on the roads. The safety of hydrogen automotive 
applications and the related infrastructure, including garages, maintenance workshops, parking, and 
tunnels is one area of concern. A typical amount of on-board stored hydrogen in a passenger car is about 
6 kg and in a bus is up to 40 kg. The release of several kilograms of hydrogen from a hydrogen powered 
vehicle during an accident in a tunnel followed by an ignition and thus deflagration is a possible accident 
scenario. The pressure and impulse generated by such deflagrations should be calculated with reasonable 
accuracy for hazards and risk assessment. The role of obstacles, i.e. vehicles, on deflagration dynamics 
in a tunnel has to be clarified. A recent numerical study by Gamezo et al. (2007) of the deflagration-
to-detonation transition (DDT) in an obstructed small-scale tube containing a hydrogen-air mixture 
gave an insight into the physics of the phenomenon. The authors demonstrated that the reflection of a 
developing shock on repeated obstacles is a reason for shock-to-detonation transition, including through 
the role of Richtmayer-Meshkov instability.
10.4.9.1. Overview of experiments 
Large-scale experiments on hydrogen-air deflagrations were performed in a 1/5th real scale tunnel 
78.5 m in length, 1.84 m in height, with a horseshoe shape cross sectional area of 3.74 m2 by Groethe 
et al. (2005). Uniform 20% and 30% hydrogen-air mixtures of 37.4 m3 volume (10 m long cloud) were 
prepared in the middle of the unobstructed tunnel and ignited at the centre of the tunnel at floor level. 
The amount of hydrogen in near stoichiometric 30% hydrogen-air cloud was equal to 1 kg. An additional 
experiment with obstructions was carried out only for a 30% hydrogen-air mixture. Mock vehicles of 
size LxWxH=940x362x343 mm were used as obstacles. The separation distance between the obstacles 
was equal to a “vehicle” length. A blockage ratio for this type of obstacle is 0.03.
Maximum overpressures along the tunnel for all three tests, one transient pressure measurement and 
impulse at a distance 34 m from the ignition source for 30% hydrogen-air mixture in the unobstructed 
tunnel test were the only experimental data reported (Groethe et al., 2005). There is no information 
reported on the exact location of the pressure transducers used in the experiments, other than their 
distance from the ignition source. The experimentalists concluded that there was no difference between 
the maximum overpressures generated by hydrogen-air explosion in the tunnel without and with 
obstacles.

10.4.9.2.  The LES model and numerical details
The LES model used for the tunnel deflagration (Molkov et al., 2008b) is exactly the same as in our 
recent study (Molkov et al., 2007b) with one exception, i.e. the theoretical fractal dimension D =2.33 was 
accepted in circumstances of absence of any preliminary information on D in geometries like tunnels. 
The calculation domain dimensions were LxWxH=300x150x75 m. The domain included both the tunnel 
and the surroundings in order to minimize the effect of boundary conditions and to simulate a pressure 
wave propagating out of the tunnel into the open atmosphere. An unstructured tetrahedral mesh with 
an average control volume (CV) size of about 0.3 m was used inside the tunnel. External to the tunnel, 
part of the calculation domain was meshed using a structured hexahedral mesh with a CV size of 4.0 m 
in order to minimize computational time. One grid was generated for the unobstructed tunnel with a 
total number of 166502 CVs, and another for the tunnel with obstacles comprising 125884 CVs. The 
grid for the unobstructed tunnel was partially refined to increase the accuracy of simulation of the blast 
wave propagating outside of the tunnel. The numerical grid for the whole calculation domain and the 
part inside the tunnel with obstacles is shown in Fig. 10–40.
Figure 10–40. The numerical grid of the calculation domain (top) and its part inside the obstructed tunnel section (bottom).
The grid sensitivity of the LES model was studied previously and it was demonstrated that the decrease 
of CV size twice results in maximum 5–10% increase of the maximum pressure at particular time, which 
arise from a better resolved flame front wrinkling and, thus, higher mass burning rate. 
The initial pressure and temperature were equal to those recorded in the experiments: T=295 K, p=101.325 
kPa. All walls and surfaces were modelled as adiabatic impermeable surfaces. Non-reflecting pressure-
far-field boundary conditions were used on the boundaries representing the atmosphere. FLUENT 6.2 
software was used as a CFD engine to realize the LES model. A coupled compressible solver with explicit 
linearization of the equation set was used with CFL=0.8. A second-order upwind scheme was used for 
discretization of the convection terms and a second-order central difference scheme was applied for the 
diffusion terms. The thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-air mixture and combustion products were 
calculated using the CHEMKIN software (Kee et al., 2000).

10.4.9.3. Results and discussion
A comparison between maximum experimental and simulated overpressures along the tunnel is 
presented in Fig. 10–41 for all three experiments. Side-on obstacle overpressure is available for numerical 
simulations only. There is good agreement for all cases with insignificant under prediction of the 
maximum overpressures in simulations. This result is very positive for the LES model validation bearing 
in mind that the model was “calibrated” for very different conditions of unconfined deflagrations.
Figure 10–41. Maximum deflagration overpressures along the tunnel (distance is given from the tunnel centre): 20% hydrogen-air 
mixture ( – experiment;  – simulations); 30% hydrogen-air mixture, unobstructed tunnel (r – experiment; p – simulations); 30% 
hydrogen-air mixture, obstructed tunnel ( – experiment;  – simulations, ceiling; ® – simulations, obstacle).
The LES analysis of cases without and with obstructions inside the tunnel demonstrated significantly higher 
deflagration generated overpressures on the obstacle surfaces (® in Fig. 10–41) compared to overpressures 
measured at the ceiling level (■ in Fig. 10–41). Indeed, in the agreement with experimental data the maximum 
overpressures simulated above the obstacle level are practically the same as those measured experimentally 
for the cases with and without obstacles. However, with increasing distance from the ignition source, the 
difference between static side-on obstacle overpressure and the static overpressure on the ceiling increases. 
This is an indication that the initial pressure wave from combustion forms a shock, which reflects from the 
rigid “vehicle” surface, thus increasing the static pressure at the stagnation area. 
The pressure in the reflected shock, p3, can be estimated from values of the initial pressure, p1, and the 
incident shock, p2, using the formula (Landau and Lifshits, 1988)

For a specific heat ratio of g=1.4, p1=1 bar and p2=2.5 bar the ratio is about p3/ p2=2.2. Because the 
formation of the shock is not yet finished and the reflection is not exactly normal the simulated ratio is 
lower than theoretical and only about p3/ p2=1.5. The numerical requirement to have 3-5 control volumes 
through any “discontinuity” in simulations could contribute to this difference too.

The simulated shock wave structure at a distance of 34 m from the ignition source reproduced transient 
pressures and impulse quite close to those measured in the experiments (Fig. 10–42). The simulated 
arrival time of the shock practically coincides with the experimental value. Somewhat faster arrival times 
of simulated oscillating pressure waves can be observed in Fig. 10–42. This could be explained by the 
higher speed of sound in the combustion products in the simulations. Indeed, the model does not include 
heat losses from combustion products. This would reduce the temperature and hence the speed of sound.

ignition source: experimental pressure dynamics (circles) and impulse (triangles), simulated pressure dynamics and impulse (solid lines).

Figure 10–43 shows simulated pressure dynamics at different distances from the ignition source along the 
tunnel. The formation of the shock wave with a steep leading edge from the initial sloping shape pressure 
wave during deflagration progression is seen. The maximum overpressure is practically the same along the 
tunnel. Bearing in mind a level of overpressure observed in experiments and reproduced in simulations, 
a serious damage to life and property inside the tunnel can be expected for the considered scenario for 
the whole duration of a tunnel as a shock wave does not indicate the tendency to decay with distance. 
Figure 10–43. The formation of shock wave during pressure wave propagation along the tunnel (ceiling level).  
Simulated pressure transients at distances 2.8, 6.2, 10.5, 14, 18, 22, 30, and 34 m from the ignition source.
The difference in dynamics of the overpressure at ceiling level and side-on obstacle overpressure along 
the tunnel is shown in Fig. 10–44. The shock is formed at the end of the tunnel. Pressure transients 
have similar dynamics at various locations along the tunnel cross section. An exception is a part of the 
pressure-time curve close to the maximum overpressure which is affected by the absence (ceiling) or 
presence (obstacle’s side) of the blast wave reflection. There is no experimental data available on the 
flame propagation inside the tunnel. There are distinctive phases of the leading edge of the flame front 
acceleration and deceleration in simulations (Fig. 10–44). The flame front reaches the end of the right 
part of the tunnel about 270 ms after ignition.

Figure 10–44. Simulated static overpressure dynamics (dotted (gray) lines – ceiling overpressures; solid lines – side-on  
obstacle overpressures; location of the computational pressure gauges can be read from the ordinate axis)  
and flame propagation dynamics (position of flame on tunnel’s centre line in time). 
In order to understand the dynamics of the deflagration in the tunnel in more detail the simulation 
results have been analysed. This analysis is presented in Fig. 10–45 (left), along with data on hydrogen 
concentration in air which is presented in Fig. 10–45 (right). 
Computational visualization of the overpressure field in the tunnel, overlapped with locations of the 
turbulent flame front brush (c=0.1–0.9), for a series of consequent moments is shown in Fig. 10–45 (left). 
This confirms the flame acceleration at initial stage, then deceleration and acceleration again up to almost 
the moment when the flame front exits the tunnel approximately 270 ms after ignition. The formation 
of the shock with time is clearly seen. Areas of high side-on obstacle pressure can be identified. The 
shock leaves the tunnel at approximately 131 ms, at this time the flame has only passed half way along 
the tunnel. The rarefaction wave is seen in Fig. 10–45 (left), this propagates inside the tunnel after the 
shock wave leaves the tunnel. This rarefaction wave, and the resulting flow induced, is responsible for 
the second acceleration of the flame. 
Fig. 10–45 (right) shows the movement of the flammable hydrogen-air mixture in a range of concentrations 
relative to the flame position; from an initial concentration of 30% down to the lower flammability 
limit of 4% of hydrogen in air. The dilution with time of the initially uniform near stoichiometric 30% 
hydrogen-air mixture (black colour in Fig. 10–45, right) by the air at the contact surface is seen. There is 
an essential decrease in the volume of flammable mixture present at approximately 140 ms. The flammable 
cloud at this time is above the level of the obstacles. Slow combustion of the hydrogen-air mixture with 
concentrations close to the lower flammability limit continues up to t=350 ms. After 140 ms combustion 
no longer has a significant effect on the flow dynamics, to the contrary the flow induced by the pressure 
waves is responsible for the second flame “acceleration” and the reverse movement of the flame back to 
the centre of the tunnel after 290 ms.

Figure 10–45. Left column: pressure and rarefaction waves, flame front (c=0.1-0.9, t<270 ms), and combustion products  
(c=0.1-0.9, t>270 ms). Right column: flammable hydrogen-air mixture propagation in the tunnel (black colour refers to 30%  
by volume of hydrogen in air, grey colour corresponds to 4% of hydrogen). Time after ignition refers to both columns.
From the analysis of Fig. 10–45 (left) and Fig. 10–45 (right) it follows that approximately 140 ms after 
ignition the premixed combustion proceeds in the upper part of the tunnel above the obstacles and 
a large mixing layer of combustion products and air develops. This can assist in the assessment of a 
thermal hazard inside the tunnel.

From Fig. 10–44 it is seen that the deceleration of flame is started at approximately 80-90 ms. There can 
be two main reasons for the flame deceleration. The first is a reduction in the transient total flame front 
area and the second is a decrease in the laminar burning velocity in the flamelets. Indeed, at approximately 
85 ms the flame reached the ceiling and the flame surface area begins to reduce. 
Let us analyse the temporal behaviour of the laminar burning velocity,

, during the deflagration. 
A value of Sui=1.96 m/s is accepted in this study as an initial value for the laminar burning velocity for 
a 30% hydrogen-air mixture (Lamoureux et al., 2003). Fig. 10–46 shows the scattering of values of the 
laminar burning velocity in the cells of the numerical flame brush for the duration of the deflagration. It 
can be seen from Fig. 10–46 that up to approximately 50 ms after ignition the laminar burning velocity is 
practically the same in the different cells of the flame front brush, i.e. there is no scattering. 
The laminar burning velocity increases slightly due to adiabatic compression according to the equation

Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Table 10–6. Temperature, baric, and thermokinetic indices for hydrogen-air  
laminar burning velocity as a function of hydrogen concentration at NTP.
Approximately 60 ms after ignition a scattering in the values of laminar burning velocity in different 
flame front locations can be observed. The scattering reaches a maximum at a time approximately 85 ms 
after ignition. At this time both the pressure effect associated with a maximum value of laminar burning 
velocity, and the dilution effect, associated with a minimum value in the scattered data, are pronounced. 
Beyond this point the dilution of the hydrogen-air mixture by the surrounding air on the contact surface 
dominates and the laminar burning velocity decreases monotonically to zero at a time of approximately 
350 ms. At this time there is no hydrogen-air mixture remaining in the tunnel at concentrations above 
the lower flammability limit (see Fig. 10–45, right).

The pressure transients at two locations at the end of the tunnel and two just outside the tunnel are 
shown in Fig. 10–47. The pressure drops quite fast to achieve a value of approximately 5 kPa at a distance 
approximately 1 diameter outside the tunnel.

source (outside the tunnel, 0.75 m and 2.75 m respectively) at 1.2 m and 1.5 m from the ground level respectively. 
10.4.9.4. Concluding remarks
The LES model, calibrated previously to predict the dynamics of large-scale hydrogen-air deflagrations 
in the open atmosphere, is validated against experimental hydrogen-air explosions in a quite different 
environment of a 78.5-m long tunnel. The simulation reproduced the experimental results for both 20% 
and 30% hydrogen-air deflagrations, and included deflagrations in an unobstructed tunnel and a tunnel 
with obstacles.
Hydrogen-air deflagrations in confined spaces present more severe hazards and associated risks compared 
to deflagrations in the open atmosphere. Indeed, overpressures registered during the near stoichiometric 
hydrogen-air deflagration of 1 kg of hydrogen in the tunnel are in the range 150–175 kPa (Groethe et 
al., 2005). This is essentially higher than overpressures of the order of only 6–10 kPa that were recorded 
during the stoichiometric hydrogen-air deflagration of significantly larger amounts of hydrogen of 55.5 
kg in the open atmosphere (Pfortner and Schneider, 1983).
The simulations confirmed experimental observations that obstacles with a blockage ratio of 0.03, as per 
the tested configuration, have no significant effect on the maximum explosion pressure in the tunnel 
beyond the immediate vicinity of the obstacles. Both experiment and numerical simulations show small 
variance in maximum pressure along the tunnel. Based on the LES analysis it is demonstrated that side-
on obstacle overpressure can increase significantly due to reflection of the shock wave formed in the 
tunnel during the deflagration.

Deflagrations
Numerical experiments should be undertaken to apply the validated LES models to assess the consequences 
of realistic releases of hydrogen in the real scale tunnels. “Optimisation” of potential accidental releases 
has to be undertaken to exclude formation of hydrogen-air clouds that able to jeopardise life. For 
example, most of released hydrogen should be mixed with air below or close to the lower flammability 
limit. The possibility of shock-to-detonation transition should be estimated to assess the potential risk 
associated with an accident involving a hydrogen fuelled vehicle in a tunnel. Following this, a scenario 
of non-uniform mixture deflagration, created by realistic hydrogen release and dispersion, should be 
simulated to access realistic hazards.
10.4.10. Lean hydrogen-air mixture combustion and non-uniform deflagrations
Most of numerical studies are devoted to uniform gaseous deflagrations. Hydrogen safety engineering 
requires prediction of pressure loads for realistic scenarios which are practically always include formation 
and consequent combustion of non-uniform flammable mixture. To be considered as a reliable predictive 
tool CFD models have to be validated against large-scale experiments which reproduce real life conditions. 
For non-reacting flows, the quantities of interest in LES are determined by the resolved large scales. 
In turbulent combustion, the essential rate-controlling processes of molecular mixing and chemical 
reaction occur at the scales which are much smaller than the resolved ones (Pope, 2004). Hence, these 
SGS processes have to be modelled. It is generally agreed that if more than 20% of turbulent scales are 
not resolved and have to be modelled then the method is called very large eddy simulations (VLES) 
rather then LES. However, we will continue to use the term LES.

Deflagrations
The LES model previously applied for prediction of large scale unconfined stoichiometric hydrogen-air 
deflagrations, and 20–30% hydrogen-air deflagrations in a 78.5 m long tunnel, has been developed further 
to reproduce dynamics of lean uniform and non-uniform (gradient) hydrogen-air premixed combustion 
in a 5.7 m height and 1.5 m diameter cylindrical vessel (Molkov, 2009c; Verbecke et al., 2009). 
Similar to previous studies the turbulent burning velocity model includes three interacting mechanisms: 
flow turbulence that is computed by Yakhot’s (1988) equation for premixed turbulent combustion; 
evolution of the turbulence generated by flame front itself with the maximum value calculated from the 
Karlovitz et al. (1951) theory; and change of a total flame front area with the integral flame scale (outer 
cut-off) and the flame front thickness (inner cut-off) following the fractal theory. 
An additional mechanism based on the leading point concept as formulated by Kuznetsov and Sabel’nikov 
and implemented by Zimont and Lipatnikov is introduced into the LES model. The results of numerical 
simulations reproduced experimental data on flame propagation in the uniform 12.8%, 14%, 16% and 20% 
by volume hydrogen-air mixtures in the large-scale vessel. The model is further applied to simulate non-
uniform hydrogen-air deflagration: a mixture with concentration gradient (27% by volume of hydrogen at 
the top of the vessel and 2.5% at the bottom, average concentration 12.6%). Good agreement is achieved 
between simulations and experimental data for dynamics of both pressure and flame propagation only 
when the fourth mechanism, i.e. the leading point concept based on the selective diffusion phenomenon, 
is introduced to the LES model. The fractal sub-model was modified as well. Instead of a constant fractal 
dimension a fractal dimension as a function of burning velocity and r.m.s. velocity is introduced to make 
the fractal sub-model more universal (North and Santavicca, 1990).
10.4.10.1. Overview of experiments 
Experiments were carried out in a hermetically sealed 5.7 m height and 1.5 m internal diameter cylindrical 
vessel. All experiments were performed with dry hydrogen-air mixtures at 25°C ± 3°C. Ignition source was 
located 15 cm beneath the top of the vessel. Several fine-wire (75 micron diameter) thermocouples were 
located on both sides along the vessel’s axis to detect the flame position in the vessel. The thermocouples 
were spaced 0.55 m apart vertically in a plane passing through the axis. Several piezoelectric transducers 
were installed at different intervals along the axis of the cylinder. 
For uniform hydrogen-air mixtures, three fans were used to homogenise the mixture. For 12.8%, 14%, 
16%, and 20% uniform hydrogen-air mixtures only data on flame propagations along the cylinder axis 
are available (Kumar and Bowles, 1990).

Deflagrations
To establish concentration gradients, the hydrogen and air were first premixed in a small chamber prior 
to entering the top of the cylinder, then hydrogen was introduced continually by increased hydrogen 
concentration in the vessel. The rate of hydrogen increase was pre-determined on the test by test basis 
to create the desire gradient. After the concentration gradient was established, hydrogen concentrations 
were measured at the vertical sampling locations (Whitehouse et al., 1996). For a non-uniform mixture 
with 12.6% by volume average concentration the hydrogen distribution along the vessel axis is reported 
in (Whitehouse et al., 1996): 27% at the top of the vessel, and decaying to 2.5% at the bottom. Pressure 
dynamics and flame propagation in the 12.6% by volume gradient hydrogen-air mixture were compared 
with those in a well-mixed uniform 12.8% by volume mixture containing equivalent amount of hydrogen 
(Kumar and Bowles, 1990).
10.4.10.2.  The LES model (2009 version) 
Selective diffusion and leading point concept
Combustion instabilities, including preferential-diffusive-thermal and hydrodynamic, cause perturbations 
of the laminar flame triggering formation of a cellular flame structure and then flame wrinkling, e.g. 
(Bradley, 1999; Bradley et al., 2001; Lipatnikov and Chomiak, 2005; Lipatnikov, 2007; Dorofeev, 2008; 
Ciccarelli and Dorofeev, 2008). 
The selective diffusion phenomenon destabilises flat laminar flame front of lean hydrogen-air mixtures. 
Protruded (convex) into unburned mixture wrinkles propagates with higher velocity compared to concave 
wrinkles due to redistribution of hydrogen close to these wrinkles. Indeed, due to higher diffusivity of 
hydrogen its concentration at convex wrinkles will grow and at concave will decrease. Consequently, the 
burning velocity will increase or decrease respectively. This will lead to the increase of wrinkles amplitude. 
The selective diffusion effect depends on wrinkle curvature, i.e. reciprocal to radius. 
There is a curvature of wrinkle at which the effect of selective diffusion on mass burning rate is maximum. 
Because a real flame has a spectrum of wrinkles of different curvature, the flame will be led by those 
wrinkles that have this optimum from a point of view of maximum burning rate curvature. These 
wrinkles will be responsible for propagation of a leading edge of flame front and called “leading points”. 
The concept of leading points was first suggested by Zeldovich and then developed further. Thus, an 
increase in the flame speed results from the development of the cellular structure in combination with 
formation of leading flamelet structures, i.e. leading points (Kuznetsov and Sabelnikov, 1990; Bradley, 
1999; Bradley et al., 2001).
Kuznetsov and Sabelnikov (1990) stated that the turbulent flame speed is controlled by the burning 
velocity of these leading point flamelets, where the mixture composition is locally altered due to different 
diffusivity of fuel and oxidiser, i.e. preferential diffusion. Based on the assumption of a critically strained 
structure for the leading point and different diffusivities of fuel and oxidiser, they derived the model for 
a local change in the mixture composition within the leading point combustion zone as follows

To account for preferential diffusion effects for curved hydrogen flames the leading point concept as 
proposed by Kuznetsov and Sabel’nikov (1990) and implemented by Zimont and Lipatnikov (1995), who 
determined the hydrogen concentration at the leading points and found their corresponding burning 
velocities by linear interpolation of the experimental data provided by Karpov and Severin, was applied 
in the LES model (Verbecke, 2009). Figure 10–48 shows the augmentation of burning velocity by the 
leading point phenomenon, clp. Lean mixtures are all affected by this mechanism. For example, for 10% 
hydrogen-air mixture the laminar burning velocity has to be multiplied by the factor 2.4.

The preferential diffusion effect coupled with flame curvature is pronounced for lean hydrogen-air 
mixtures and has to be accounted for in the premixed combustion model through an additional “leading 
point” turbulence factor. This fourth mechanism of the turbulent burning velocity enhancement causes 
flamelet perturbations in the proximity of these leading flamelets cannot be resolved on meshes applied 
for large-scale problems and thus has to be modelled at SGS level. The leading point flame wrinkling 
factor

is introduced in the combustion model to correct the SGS burning velocity. It is assumed 
that the leading point turbulence coefficient develops linearly with radius to reach the maximum (see

Update of the fractal sub-model (2009)
As the flame propagates, the Peclet number Pe (ratio of flame radius to flame thickness) increases 
beyond the second critical Peclet number, Pecl, from which the flame becomes self-similar, self-turbulized 
(Bradley, 1999; Bradley et al., 2001). The nature of combustion in the regime for 
FO
3H
3H t
 is referred as 
fractal-like flame wrinkling and is responsible for a further increase of the turbulent burning velocity. 
Gostintsev et al. (1988) suggested that there is a transition from a cellular flame to a self-similar flame 
propagation regime at critical radius 1.0–1.2 m for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures, i.e. at the 
critical Peclet number of about 100,000 when a flame thickness is estimated as a/Su where a stands for 
the thermal diffusivity. Bradley (1997) reported that in every case the burning velocity was about three 
times the laminar burning velocity just after the suggested transition.

The fractal theory was developed to provide a tool for description of highly contorted surfaces. Fully 
developed turbulent flame in the flamelet regime can be considered as such kind of surface. If R0 is a 
critical radius of a spherical flame at which the transition from laminar to turbulent self-similar regime 
of flame propagation is accomplished (R0=1.0-1.2 m for near stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures 
according to Gostintsev et al., 1988) then the following formula is applied to calculate the growth of 
turbulent burning velocity at radius R due to fractal structure of turbulent flame

A wide range of experimental values were suggested for the fractal dimension of flames. Gouldin (1988) 
argued that for low intensity turbulence the fractal dimension is lower than 7/3, and found D=2.11 for 
very low turbulent flow intensities. Murayama and Takeno (1988), obtained fractal dimension data 
varying in a range D=2.2–2.35, with an average value around 2.26 for open atmosphere turbulent flames. 
Similar values D=2.2–2.33 were reported by Gostintsev et al. (1999) for freely propagating premixed 
flames. Bradley (1999) suggested a theoretical value of D=2.33. Gülder et al. (2000) reported fractal 
dimensions within a range D=2.14-2.24. 
The choice of the fractal dimension from the wide range of mentioned values is ambiguous. To make the 
LES model more universal the fractal sub-model has to exclude as much as possible adjustable by user 
parameters. North and Santavicca (1990) defined the fractal dimension by an empirical parameterization 
as a function of the ratio of the fluctuating velocity to the laminar burning velocity, u’/Su,

see equation (10–99). There is only one empirical constant, i.e. ψ , available for a calibration of the LES 
model. There is a reservation for value of the critical diameter R0 for lean and reach mixtures.
Numerical details
The calculation domain was designed according to the specification of the facility description (Kumar

Results and discussion
A comparison between experimental and simulated flame propagation along the vessel axis for uniform 
12.8%, 14%, 16% and 20% hydrogen-air mixtures is presented in Fig. 10–50. There is a reasonably good 
agreement for all mixtures with a calibration constant ψ = 1. It is worth noting that using exactly the 
same LES model as described in this section for large-scale unconfined near stoichiometric hydrogen-air 
deflagrations, and 20% and 30% hydrogen-air deflagrations in a 78.5 m long tunnel, the best agreement 
with experiments was achieved with ψ = 0.5 (Verbecke, 2009). This may be attributed to instabilities, 
e.g. flame front interaction with acoustic waves, which are not resolved for this large-scale vessel and 
are not yet modelled at SGS level. Flame propagation in enclosure generates acoustic waves that, after 
reflections from the walls, interact with the flame front and develop flame perturbations, see for example 
(Dorofeev, 2008; Ciccarelli and Dorofeev, 2008).
Figure 10–50. Experimental and simulated flame propagation dynamics along the vessel axis  
for 20%, 16%, 14%, and 12.8% hydrogen-air mixtures (Verbecke et al., 2009).
Modelling studies confirmed experimental findings that the enhancement of flame front wrinkling in 
a changing pressure field is associated with generation of vorticity through baroclinic effects (Liu et al., 
1993; Batley et al., 1996). Bradley and Harper (1994) showed that Rayleigh-Taylor instability is the most 
probable source of turbulence arising from the baroclinic term

 in the vorticity equation. 
In its turn, the vorticity generation is promoted by flame-acoustic interaction, distorting the flame and 
further increasing the flame surface area. This mechanism is not yet resolved or modelled in the LES 
model. 
Another possible reason for the increase of ψ from 0.5 for near stoichiometric to 1 for lean hydrogen-
air mixtures is approaching a theoretical maximum for the turbulence generated by flame front itself 
in lean slowly burning mixtures, when “closing” of wrinkles is slower due to smaller burning velocity.

Deflagrations
The leading point mechanism is essential for modelling lean hydrogen-air deflagrations as seen in  
Fig. 10–51. Without the implementation of leading point factor into the turbulent burning velocity model, 
the flame propagation is significantly underestimated compared to the experimental data. Indeed, for 
20% hydrogen-air mixture the flame propagation velocity is equal to 44 m/s at distance 1 m from the 
ignition source and 162 m/s at distance 3 m with the turbulent burning velocity corrected by the leading 
point factor, and it is only 22 m/s and 50 m/s at 1 m and 3 m respectively without the correction. In 
the case of uniform 12.8% hydrogen-air mixture, the flame speed is 7.7 m/s at 1 m with correction and 
only 2.95 m/s without correction. 
Figure 10–51. Experimental and simulated flame propagation with/without implementation  
of the leading point correction for uniform 12.8% and 20% hydrogen-air mixtures.
Figure 10–52 shows flame propagation dynamics for the uniform (12.8% vol.) and the gradient (average 
12.6% vol.) hydrogen-air mixtures. For a scenario with practically the same amount of hydrogen released, 
flame propagates much faster in the mixture with concentration gradient. This can be explained by 
higher hydrogen concentration at location of the ignition source, i.e. 27% by volume hydrogen that is 
close to the stoichiometry. It can be estimated that for the gradient hydrogen-air mixture the flame speed 
reaches 57 m/s and 209 m/s at 1 m and 3 m from the ignition source respectively. For the uniform 12.8% 
hydrogen-air mixture the flame speed at the same locations reaches only 7.7 m/s and 9 m/s respectively.

Comparison of experimental and simulated pressure dynamics for 12.8% uniform hydrogen-air mixture 
and 12.6% gradient hydrogen-air mixture is shown in Fig. 10–53. The pressure rise is much steeper 
in the mixture with the hydrogen concentration gradient compared to the uniform 12.8% hydrogen-
air mixture. This is consistent with observed flame speeds and conclusions of the experimental study 
(Whitehouse et al., 1996) for top ignition: mixtures with hydrogen concentration gradient have much 
shorter times to peak overpressure than uniform mixtures with the same quantity of hydrogen because 
of higher hydrogen concentration at the ignition point.

Figure 10–53. Experimental and simulated pressure dynamics for uniform 12.8% hydrogen-air 
mixture and non-uniform (12.6% averaged) gradient hydrogen-air mixture.
It is worth noting that the best fit simulation for the gradient (average 12.6% vol.) hydrogen-air mixture 
deflagration was obtained with ψ = 0.7 as compared to ψ = 1 for all uniform lean hydrogen-air mixtures 
in a range of concentrations 12.8-20.0% by volume. The possible reason may be the fact that in the 
gradient mixture the hydrogen concentration in the ignition region is near stoichiometric (27% vol.) 
with typically lower value of ψ. This is probably due to more pronounced intrinsic feature of lean flames 
to generate Karlovitz turbulence closer to its theoretical maximum.
The simulated pressure for non-uniform mixture is close to experiment. Contrary, simulated pressure develops 
faster than experimental pressure transients for the uniform mixture. This can be explained by absence of 
heat losses from hot combustion products to walls in the simulations. Heat losses have to grow with time. 
Concluding remarks
The LES model, calibrated previously to predict dynamics of large-scale hydrogen-air deflagrations in 
the open atmosphere and in a 78.5 m length tunnel, is developed further to reproduce experimental 
data on dynamics of lean uniform and non-uniform hydrogen-air deflagrations in 5.7 m height and 1.5 
m diameter closed vessel. 
The turbulent burning velocity model accounts for four mechanisms affecting turbulent burning velocity. In 
addition to three mechanisms applied in the previous versions of the model, i.e. flow turbulence, turbulence 
generated by the flame front itself, and fractal increase of flame front area with an integral flame scale, 
the model is amended by the fourth so-called leading point mechanism , affecting the mass burning rate 
through the synergy of preferential diffusion instability and spectrum of flamelets of different curvature 
(Kuznetsov and Sabelnikov, 1990; Zimont and Lipatnikov, 1995). The fractal sub-model is modified by the 
introduction of the inner cut-off dependence of deflagration pressure and temperature, which is taken as the 
flame front thickness, and the “universal” equation for the fractal dimension by North and Santavicca (1990).

The LES model update enables to reproduce the experimental flame propagation and pressure dynamics 
of lean uniform hydrogen-air mixtures in the range from 12.8% to 20% by volume of hydrogen in air. 
It is demonstrated that without correction of turbulent burning velocity by the preferential diffusion 
factor the flame propagation dynamics in lean hydrogen-air mixtures (12.8–20% vol.) is significantly 
under predicted.
Experimental data on flame propagation and deflagration pressure dynamics in the gradient (average 
12.6% vol.) hydrogen-air mixture are reproduced by the LES model. In full agreement with experiment 
the pressure build up and flame propagation are much faster in the gradient mixture compared to the 
uniform mixture with practically the same amount of hydrogen.
The role of Rayleigh-Taylor instability, enhanced by flame-acoustic interaction within closed cylinder 
geometry, on the increase of the only calibration parameter of the model coefficient ψ is discussed briefly. 
It is suggested that the turbulence generated by slower burning lean hydrogen-air flames is closer to the 
theoretical maximum of the Karlovitz’s turbulence compared to near stoichiometric mixtures. However, 
more research is needed to understand the dependence of ψ on deflagration parameters. 
10.4.11. Multi-phenomena turbulent burning velocity model of deflagrations
The multi-phenomena turbulent burning velocity model for LES of large-scale deflagrations is being 
continuously developed at the University of Ulster since 2002. The model is summarised in this section. 
There was no adjustment of any model parameters compared to the last version of the model published 
(Molkov, 2009c; Verbecke et al., 2009). Recently the model has been successfully applied to simulated 
distorted tulip flame in a small-scale closed duct (Xiao et al., 2012).
The compressible LES governing equations are obtained by filtering the three-dimensional conservation 
equations of mass, momentum, energy and the progress variable equation. The sub-grid scale (SGS) 
turbulence model derived from the renormalization group (RNG) theory by Yakhot and Orszag (1986) 
is adopted. The RNG model is purely theoretical and does not contain any empirical parameters. It is 
able to reproduce laminar, transitional and turbulent flows. 
The progress variable equation is used to model the flame front propagation. The mass burning rate is 
described by the gradient method (Prudnikov, 1967). The gradient method ensures that the prescribed 
mass burning rate
t
uS
ρ
 takes place in the simulations independent of the grid resolution. The numerical 
requirement to the gradient method is that a simulated flame thickness spreads over 4-5 control volumes.
The model is based on the assumption of a flamelet regime of premixed turbulent combustion that is 
thought to be valid for accidental combustion with comparatively large scales and moderate turbulence. 
In the model, the mass burning rate is determined in general as a product of the local burning velocity 
in a flamelet and the surface area of flamelets both being affected by different instabilities, etc.

10.4.11.1. Effect pressure, temperature and concentration on the burning velocity 
The values of laminar burning velocity for the whole hydrogen flammable range can be found in the 
literatures (Zimont and Lipatnikov, 1995; Tse et al., 2000; Lamoureux et al., 2003). The dependence 
of laminar burning velocity on temperature and pressure during deflagration simulations uses the 
assumption of adiabatic compression or expansion similar to previous studies (Molkov and Nekrasov, 
1981)

10.4.11.2. Effect of flow turbulence on the burning rate 
When turbulence occurs in the flow during combustion wave propagation the flame front would be 
distorted and the burning rate will be enhanced consequently. The flame thickness is normally a fraction 
of a millimeter (Aung et al., 1997) and it is impractical to resolve in simulations the three-dimensional real 
flame thickness and the flow turbulence at all scales, i.e. it is impossible to perform DNS at comparatively 
large scales characteristic for most of hydrogen safety problems.

The effect of flow turbulence on the flame front wrinkling is partially resolved by LES at scales comparable 
to applied mesh. The effect of unresolved SGS flow turbulence is modeled following the Yakhot’s

However, the Yakhot’s equation cannot be used in its original form in the LES of large-scale deflagrations 
as the mesh size is large compared to the flame front thickness and thus phenomena affecting the 
turbulent burning rate at scales of flame thickness cannot be resolved in simulations. In order to account 
for various mechanisms enhancing turbulent burning velocity and unresolved on a comparatively large 
mesh, i.e. selective diffusion and flamelet curvature as well as turbulence generated by flame front itself 
and fractals structure of the flame front, the laminar burning velocity in the original Yakhot’s equation 
is substituted by a SGS wrinkling velocity in the model

This is the principle difference in the application of the Yakhot’s equation compared to other studies. 
As the SGS physical mechanisms cannot be resolved directly, the methods used to account for these 
mechanisms are overviewed below.
10.4.11.3 Effect of turbulence generated by flame front itself 
The wrinkled or turbulent flame front generates additional turbulence in the near-field region (Karlovits 
et al., 1951). The increase of surface area of the flame front due to the turbulence generated by the flame 
front itself cannot be resolved with current computing power even for moderate scale practical problems. 
The upper limit for a flame wrinkling factor due to the self-induced turbulence can be derived for high 
Reynolds number flows as (Molkov et l., 1984)

10.4.11.4. Effect of preferential diffusion coupled with flamelet curvature (leading point) 
The hydrogen flame with a Lewis number less than unity is affected by the preferential diffusion effect. 
For a given mixture composition, there exists a flame curvature radius which corresponds to the 
maximum mass burning rate. According to Zeldovich’s idea the flamelets of such curvature will lead the 
turbulent premixed flame propagation. Zimont and Lipatnikov (1995), based on the work of Kuznetsov 
and Sabelnikov (1990), calculated a leading point coefficient

Turbulent flame has a contorted surface. Thus, the conclusions of the fractal theory are applied to model 
change of fractal surface area of a turbulent flame as a function of the outer cut-off that is usually the 
flame size, and the inner cut-off that is currently chosen as the flame front thickness. The enhancement

turbulence generated by flame front itself, the leading point mechanisms, and the fractal increase of 
turbulent flame front area. The turbulent burning velocity is modeled as

11	 Detonations
11.1.	
Direct initiation of detonation
The ability of a hydrogen-air mixture to direct initiation of detonation is greater than that of hydrocarbons. 
The direct initiation of hydrogen-air mixture detonation is possible by 1.1 g of high explosive tetryl 
(BRHS, 2009). Only 1.86 g of high explosive TNT (trinitrotoluene) is needed to initiate detonation in 
34.7% hydrogen-air mixture in the open atmosphere. However, for 20% hydrogen-air mixture the critical 
TNT charge increases significantly to 190 g. 
For comparison, release of energy during explosive reaction of 1 g TNT is arbitrarily standardized as 
4.184 kJ (a gram of TNT releases 4.1–4.602 kJ upon explosion, see Wikipedia), and the lower heat of 
combustion of 1 g of hydrogen is equal to (241.7 kJ/mol / 2.016 g/mol) = 119.89 kJ. Thus, the TNT 
equivalent of hydrogen is high: 28.65, i.e. 28.65 g of TNT is energetic equivalent of 1 g of hydrogen. 
11.2.	
LES of hydrogen-air detonations
The large eddy simulation (LES) model of hydrogen-air detonation at very large scales, which doesn’t 
require Arrhenius chemistry, is presented in this section (Zbikowski et al., 2008). The progress variable 
equation is applied for the first time to simulate propagation of a reaction front following and coupled 
with a leading shock. The gradient method, based on a product of pre-shock mixture density and 
detonation velocity, is employed as a source term in the progress variable equation. Chemical kinetics 
enters the combustion model only through its influence on the detonation velocity and modelling of 
detailed chemistry is omitted. 
The LES model is verified against theoretical solution by the Zeldovich-von Neumann-Döring (ZND) 
theory for a case of planar 29.05% hydrogen-air detonation in elongated 3x3x100 m calculation domain. 
Thermodynamically calculated values of the specific heats ratio for burned mixture g=1.22 and the 
standard heat of combustion DHc=3.2 MJ/kg are applied without any adjustment often applied in other 
models to achieve better reproduction of experimental data. 
Numerical simulation reproduced theoretical values of von Neumann spike, Chapman-Jouguet pressure, 
Taylor wave and prescribed detonation propagation velocity. There are no adjustable parameters in the 
model. Practically no grid sensitivity for the planar detonation wave is demonstrated by this LES model. 
Detonation velocity and pressures are shown to be nearly independent of the computational cell size in a 
wide range of cell sizes 0.1–1.0 m. Impulse depends to some extent on a cell size. There is no intention to 
use this oriented on large-scale applications LES model to reproduce fine structure of the detonation wave.

Detonation is a worst case scenario for accidents with unscheduled hydrogen release. Higher propensity 
of hydrogen-air mixtures to deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) compared to hydrocarbon-
air mixtures, along with lower ignition energy and wider detonability limits, require special technical 
and organizational measures to guarantee the same level of safety for emerging hydrogen-powered 
technologies as for today’s fossil-fuelled economy. Contemporary engineering tools are needed to simulate 
pressure effects of hydrogen explosions in the open atmosphere and complex geometries at practical 
scales. Prediction of detonation pressure effects, i.e. pressure and impulse, as well as blast parameters 
beyond the detonation zone are important for hydrogen safety engineering, particularly for hazard and 
risk assessment through realistic safety distance assessment for hydrogen infrastructure and development 
of mitigation techniques.
The Zeldovich – von Neumann – Döring (ZND) theory, developed by Zeldovich (1940), von Neumann 
(1942) and Döring (1943) following the analysis of one-dimensional shock with energy feeding performed 
earlier independently by Chapman (1899) and Jouguet (1905–1906), implies that detonation is a complex 
of precursor shock and combustion wave. This shock compresses the fresh mixture and enables it to 
react. The end of reaction zone is defined by the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) condition (sonic plane).
Expansion of the combustion products in the reaction zone creates the thrust supporting the leading 
shock (Lee, 2008a). An ideal detonation travels at a near constant supersonic speed of von Neumann 
shock 1.5–3 km/s with a propagation Mach number between 4.5 and 9 (Ficket and Davis, 2000). The 
reacting flow is subsonic relative to the shock, and the local Mach number M (M<1) increases with the 
distance from the leading shock due to the heat release by the chemical reaction (Clavin, 2004). 
Detonation front thickness is a distance from the precursor shock to the end of reaction zone where the 
CJ condition is reached. Each wave of the ZND type has a minimum sustainable detonation speed known 
as the CJ speed in which a sonic plane (relative to the detonation shock speed) arises at the CJ point. 
The reaction zone in detonation is usually less than 10 mm for most stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures and 
less than 0.1 mm for fuel-oxygen mixtures (Bauwens, 2006), which is due to the fact that in detonation 
a material is consumed 103 to 108 times faster than in an ordinary premixed flame making detonation 
“easily distinguishable from other combustion processes” (Ficket and Davis, 2000).
Combustion energy released in reaction front feeds the leading shock by sonic waves. The speed of 
detonation wave and the thermodynamic state at the CJ point are determined by the initial upstream 
shock state and by the equation of state for the reaction products alone. Rapid combustion occurs in 
the detonation as a result of the exponential dependence of the chemical reaction rate on temperature 
which in consequence supports the shock (Lee, 1984; Oran, 1999). The particular form of the reaction 
rate law and the equation of state for partially reacted material affect only the interior structure of the 
reaction zone (Ficket and Davis, 2000; Short, 2005).

Downstream of the sonic plane is a region where an expansion wave, i.e. Taylor wave, connects the state 
at the CJ plane to the rear boundary. The Taylor wave does not have to be attached to the final point, 
i.e. CJ point (Ficket and Davis, 2000; Short, 2005). The expansion fan is not strictly a part of either the 
CJ or ZND models. The products beyond the CJ plane continue to accelerate as they expand and their 
temperature and pressure continue to drop. Taylor (1950) was the first to examine the distribution of 
velocity in this region. Gas velocity at the CJ plane is about ⅓ of D (Nettleton, 1987). The pressure 
gradient in the expansion wave for particular pressure depends only on the distance of the front from 
the detonation origin. At the end of the Taylor wave for planar detonation the pressure is about 0.375 
of PCJ (Nettleton, 1987).
Euler equations with Arrhenius chemistry are commonly used for numerical simulation of detonations. 
The application of Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is more promising approach (Sharpe, 2001) enabling 
DDT modelling and simulation. However, as mentioned by Fujiwara and Fukiba (2001) the unsteadiness 
in multidimensional detonation makes it extremely difficult to use NS equations, because of a number 
of unsteady shear layers existing not only on the tube walls but also down-stream of the curved and 
intersecting shock waves.

Detonations
Real detonation wave structure is far more complex than in the ZND model of planar detonation, and 
involves interactions between incident shocks, Mach stems, transverse waves, and boundary layers 
through which detonation is moving (Lee, 2008b). At the interaction of a transverse wave, Mach stem and 
incident shock, triple points are formed and create patterns called detonation cells, which size depends 
on the mixture composition and the chemical reaction mechanism (Oran, 1999). Resolution of these 
three-dimensional structures would require grid size of the order of few microns. Such resolution has 
to be naturally given up in tackling large-scale industrial problems.
Over 100 points are required in the half-reaction length of steady planar detonation to obtain a truly 
converged solution when Arrhenius chemistry is applied (Sharpe, 2000). Resolutions of less than about 
20 points per half-reaction length give very poor or else entirely spurious solutions. Short and Quirk 
(1997) have shown that for pulsating detonations with realistic chain-branching reactions, a few hundred 
points per half-reaction length may be required to obtain even the qualitatively correct solutions. The 
resolution required to obtain converged solutions in multi-dimensional cellular detonation simulations 
is likely to be higher than that for the simpler pulsating detonations. 
Generation of high-accuracy solution-adaptive grids resolving all such highly-unsteady shear layers is 
impossible within the present computational capabilities as a required mesh of 1 micron necessitates 
2x1010 grid points for a 2D domain of only 10x20 cm which is far too small for accident scales of tens and 
hundreds of meters. Increase of cell size makes even one step irreversible Arrhenius chemistry incapable 
of reproduction of experimental explosion characteristics without “recalibration” for each particular grid. 
An important feature of the Arrhenius reaction rate detonation models at large scales is that numerical 
mesh doesn’t allow to resolve the detonation front and its simulated thickness is much larger than the 
physical one, hence the reaction rate is grid-sensitive. As a result the application of Arrhenius reaction 
rate equation to large-scale detonation modelling requires calibration of grid-dependent pre-exponential 
factor and activation energy, as well as calibration of a value of the heat of combustion in some cases, 
to provide CJ detonation propagation speed. Modelling of the planar ZND detonation using CFD and 
Arrhenius reaction rate chemistry would require resolution of the reaction zone with a grid size of 
the order of microns, otherwise, “tuning” of constants in the Arrhenius equation with the grid size is 
necessary. This makes detonation simulations with Arrhenius chemistry on large grids “loose”. Thus, 
Arrhenius chemistry approach can hardly be suggested as a grid independent tool for hydrogen safety 
engineering to tackle large-scale problems. Alternative methods of detonation modelling should be 
developed, verified by recognised theories and validated against large-scale experiments. 
A few publications on simulation of comparatively large-scale hydrogen-air detonations can be found 
in literature (Breitung et al., 1996; Armand et al., 1997; Ng et al., 2007; Vaagsaether et al., 2007; Bedard-
Tremblay et al., 2009; Heidari et al., 2009). Some details of these studies are overviewed below.

Detonations
The simulations of hydrogen-air detonation experiment in the RUT facility using Euler equations were 
presented by Breitung et al. (1996). The authors used one-step Arrhenius chemical reaction and the 
uniform cubic mesh size of 1 cm. Simulation of 25% hydrogen-air mixture detonation demonstrated a 
close agreement between the simulated and the observed pressure peak arrival time. Difference between 
the experimental and the simulated pressure impulse was within 10%. However, the simulation of 16% 
hydrogen-air mixture detonation required introduction of two-step reaction chemistry on the 1 cm size 
mesh.
Reduced chemistry with five reactions was used in (Armand et al., 1997) to model detonations, including 
the hydrogen-air detonation experiments in the RUT facility. The authors performed 3D simulations, but 
1D and 2D calibration studies were used prior to detonation simulations to find suitable pre-exponential 
factor and activation energy which would reproduce the experimentally observed detonation pressures 
and propagation velocity.
The detonation simulations by Heidari et al. (2009) were based on the Euler equation set and single 
step chemistry with grid resolution of the order of 5 cm. The constants of the Arrhenius reaction, i.e. 
pre-exponential factor and activation energy, had to be adjusted to ensure that CJ pressure and velocity 
are reproduced. The authors paid special attention to shock capturing and used Van Leer (TVD family) 
scheme.
Detonation of non-uniform hydrogen-air mixture, resulted from accidental hydrogen release in the 
electrolyser facility with sizes 4.0x2.54 m and the reformer facilities with sizes 2.9x2.1 m, was simulated 
by Bedard-Tremblay et al. (2009) using 2D formulation. The authors used one step Arrhenius reaction 
rate chemistry and Euler equations. A flux limiter scheme was used close to the shock for the better shock 
capturing and second order accurate in space and time schemes were used in the rest of the domain. 2D 
formulation allowed to use the numerical mesh size as small as 1.4 mm.
Comprehensive review of detonation modelling and numerical simulations may be found elsewhere 
(Gamezo and Oran, 2005). Detonation models were used to solve combustion and detonation problems 
including shock–flame interactions and predictive DDT (Oran et al., 2008). A review of an alternative 
method for detonation/DDT simulations to Arrhenius chemistry can be found in (Cant et al., 2004).
Numerical simulations are performed sometimes not only with different Arrhenius constants yet with 
thermodynamic parameters different from actual ones to achieve better agreement with experiment. 
These can include increased heat of combustion or reduced ratio of specific heats for combustion products 
of hydrogen-air mixtures, e.g. γ=1.16–1.17 instead of 1.24 for stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture, etc. 
The LES detonation model developed at Ulster is free from such adjustments.

The DDT phenomenon includes both deflagration, i.e. subsonic propagation of combustion wave, 
and detonation, i.e. supersonic propagation of coupled shock and reaction front structure, as well as 
their interaction with shocks, shock reflections, boundary layers, etc. (Oran et al., 2008). Contrary to 
detonation, where effects of viscosity play negligible role and which may be modelled using inviscid Euler 
equations, a DDT model requires solution of Navier-Stokes equations as viscosity and turbulence are 
important part of the DDT process. Thus, DDT simulations (Gamezo et al., 2008) were based on solution 
of the Navier-Stokes equation set, one-step Arrhenius reaction mechanism; the calculation domain was 
2x128 cm only. It is worth to mention that the required resolution in this simulation was of the order 
4.8 microns. Simulations of DDT at larger scale pipe of 0.107x4 m was attempted in (Vaagsaether et 
al., 2007). The authors also solved Navier-Stokes equations and used two-step Arrhenius reaction rate 
mechanism on 2 mm grid.
In this section we test the LES model to reproduce parameters of hydrogen-air detonation without 
Arrhenius chemistry. The objective is verification of a new LES methodology to simulate planar hydrogen-
air detonation at scales of hundred of meters against a solution by the ZND theory. 
The LES model will be applied in this section to simulate detonation of near stoichiometric 29.05% 
hydrogen-air mixture at initial conditions of 0.099 MPa and 304 K, that travels at 1954 m/s with a 
propagation Mach number M=4.8 and the detonation front thickness 5.21 mm according to the ZND 
theory (Brown and Shepherd, 2006).

11.2.2.	
The LES model of detonation and its verification against the ZND theory 
The LES models of deflagration and detonation exhibit similarities. The underlying idea of this approach 
is a transient simulation of deflagration through the DDT to detonation in the future using the same 
model and software.
The governing equations are the same as for the LES deflagration model described in the previous chapter, 
and include the continuity equation for mass conservation, the Navier-Stokes equations for momentum 
conservation, and the energy conservation equation. The progress variable equation for detonation 
propagation has the same form as for gaseous deflagrations with only one difference, i.e. the turbulent 
burning velocity being substituted by the detonation velocity in the source term. The renormalization 
group (RNG) model is applied for sub-grid scale (SGS) modelling of turbulence. 
Combustion model 
The extent of reaction in the detonation wave can be measured in terms of the progress variable, 
which has zero value c=0 immediately behind the leading shock and c=1 at the CJ plane at which 
reaction is complete (Nettleton, 1987). Chemical kinetics enters the combustion model only through 
its influence on the detonation velocity and modelling of detailed chemistry is omitted in this 
approach. This creates conditions for grid independency of the numerical methodology when the 
gradient method is applied. 
The combustion model applied for detonation front tracking is based on the same progress variable equation 
as for the LES model of deflagration, with the gradient method for a source term, 
c

. The 
only difference between deflagration and detonation mathematical models, as mentioned above, is the 
substitution of turbulent burning velocity by detonation velocity. Integration of the source term through 
the numerical reaction front thickness reproduces independent on an actual numerical thickness of  
the front a physically correct mass consumption rate per unit area of the planar detonation wave, i.e. 
D
u ⋅
ρ
. The mass flow rate of mixture entering the unit area of the planar shock is equal to the mixture 
mass consumed at time unit per unit area of reaction front following the shock.
Detonation velocity, D, is pre-calculated for each mixture composition, e.g. with use of the Shock and 
Detonation Toolbox (http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/EDL/public/cantera/html/SD_Toolbox/index.html).

29.05% hydrogen-air mixture

=3.2 MJ/kg is applied. Similar to the heat of combustion, the specific 
heats ratios for unburned and burnt mixtures calculated thermodynamically without any adjustment 
were adopted. Specific heats of unburned and burnt mixtures throughout the calculation domain were 
approximated as piecewise-polynomial functions of temperature with polynomial coefficients calculated 
according to mass-weighted mixing law of composing species. The ratios of specific heats for fresh and 
burnt mixture were calculated as γu =1.4 and γb =1.22 respectively. The ratio of specific heats for burnt 
mixture was determined for isobaric conditions at CJ plane.
The gradient method does not define the exact location of the reaction front as an interface in a computational 
cell or between cells, but represents it as a monotonous change of the progress variable through a number 
of control volumes (CV) as underlined by Oran and Boris (2001). The numerical requirement for a flame 
front thickness simulated by the gradient method is about 4–5 CVs (Hawkes and Cant, 2001). Bearing in 
mind that a real reacting zone thickness in detonation wave is a few millimetres, there is a full understanding 
that a simulated reaction zone for large-scale problems could occupy up to a few meters, e.g. in case of 1 
m mesh, and simulation of a fine structure of the detonation wave has to be given up. 
This requirement of 4-5 cells is valid not for reaction front yet for the shock resolution too. It is worth 
noting that simulated shock is essentially thickened compared to real von Neumann shock of a few free path 
distances. This numerical requirement to simulated “fronts” should be correctly addressed in the numerical 
realisation of the model to keep reaction front behind the shock without their non-physical overlap. This 
numerical peculiarity could lead to “loss” of a part of released combustion energy out of feeding the leading 
shock and as a result to “not resolving” von Neumann spike and other non-physical simulated parameters.
It is clear that the fine structure of detonation wave cannot be resolved by this methodology at large scale like 
by other techniques. However, as demonstrated later, the method reproduces overall detonation parameters 
needed for explosion safety engineering, i.e. pressure, impulse and propagation velocity, quite well.
Calculation domain, initial and boundary conditions 
Numerical experiments with LES of planar detonation wave propagation were performed in elongated 
calculation domain of 3x3x100 m with one closed end. Three hexahedral grids were built of control 
volumes with sizes 0.5x0.5x1 m (3600 CVs), 0.5x0.5x0.25 m (14400 CVs), 0.5x0.5x0.5 m (7200 CVs), and 
0.5x0.5x0.1 m (36000 CVs). Detonation was initiated at the closed end of the calculation domain. The 
symmetry conditions were defined on the “walls” and on the “ground” to simulate the planar detonation 
propagation in a 3D geometry.

Initial conditions are taken as in the experiment by Pförtner and Schneider (1984), temperature 304 
K and pressure 99.9 kPa. Mixture is initially quiescent, u=0 m/s. Hydrogen and air concentrations are 
equal to YH2=0.02789 and Ya=0.9721 respectively. The progress variable is c=0 in the whole domain except 
the area of detonation initiation. Initiation of detonation is simulated by defining the following initial 
conditions in one slice of control volume at the closed end of the channel: pressure 10 MPa, temperature 
3000 K and the progress variable c=1. 
Numerical scheme 
The Fluent 6.3 solver was employed as a platform for the realization of the LES model of detonation. 
The double precision parallel version of the solver was used with explicit linearization of the governing 
equations. To compute the convective fluxes the Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM+) was 
used (Liou, 1996) and the central difference scheme for diffusion terms. The 4-order Runge–Kutt scheme 
was applied for time stepping. 
The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number was equal to CFL=0.05. This number was found to provide 
solution stability and convergence for simulation as the detonation speed is higher than the speed of 
sound used in the CFL definition. Sensitivity of numerical simulations to CFL number was tested. For 
CFL between 0.05 and 0.2 the numerical solution was converging and stable with no noticeable difference 
in detonation overpressure. For larger CFL values numerical instabilities occur and theoretical pressure 
peak was not reproduced. The physical explanation of small CFL numbers is quite obvious. Indeed, the 
original CFL number definition for compressible flows is reciprocal to the sum of a flow velocity and 
the speed of sound in a computational cell. However, the characteristic velocity for detonation process 
is larger than the speed of sound. Hence, a smaller CFL number is needed to provide a time step in 
explicit solver at which, for example, von Neumann spike propagates through a cell in a few steps rather 
than “jumps” through a number of cells in one time step.
Results and discussion
The simulation results are compared against solution by the ZND theory for a planar detonation wave. 
The theoretical parameters of planar detonation are calculated by methods (Brown and Shepherd, 2005 
and 2006; http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/EDL/public/cantera/html/SD_Toolbox/index.html) built on the 
one-dimensional detonation theory and presented in Table 11–1 along with results of LES for four grids 
applied with longitudinal cell size 0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m. The LES model is slightly conservative 
relative to the theoretical predictions for 29.05% hydrogen-air mixture.

is a small secondary shock propagating after the leading shock (see Figs. 11–1 and 11–4). This shock is 
created by expanding driver gas (Edwards et al., 1975) and can be affected by numerical procedure of

at time 24.8 ms (shock is at 49 m), D=0.1 m (Zbikowski et al., 2008).
Figure 11–2 demonstrates the pressure distribution in space when detonation was initiated differently. 
The progress variable was “slowly” increased (linearly) from 0 to 1 during 25 ms in one slice of CVs with 
initial conditions as in the rest of domain. The secondary pressure wave moves with sonic velocity away 
from the ignition point and finally evolves into a weak shock. In the experimental investigations only a 
short period of the pressure time history is recorded during the passage of the detonation for each probe 
position. Therefore, no further information on the waves following the detonation is available from the 
experiments (Bielert and Sichel, 1998).

Figure 11–3. Typical profiles of pressure and temperature in the detonation wave.
The simulated von Neumann spike is 2.73 MPa for a grid with CV size 0.5x0.5x0.1 m. This is very 
close to the theoretical value 2.69 MPa calculated by the ZND theory. The LES results are practically 
independent of mesh size as seen from Table 11–1 (see Fig. 11–6 also). In the numerical experiment 
the detonation wave propagates with velocity 1960 m/s (grid 0.5x0.5x0.1 m) despite the fact that it is a 
pre-defined constant equal to 1956 m/s according to calculation by the ZND theory. This is a numerical 
error which can be caused, in particular, by a fact that the integral of the source term (gradient of the 
progress variable) through the thickness of the numerical flame front is not equal to 1 on the grid applied. 
However, the accuracy of the order of 0.2% in this particular case of the numerical simulation of a strong 
shock followed by a reaction front on quite coarse grid can be treated as satisfactory. 
At CJ plane that corresponds to the end of the reaction zone and where the progress variable is equal c=1 
the simulated pressure in detonation wave equals to its theoretical ZND value of 1.45 MPa. Simulated 
temperature at von Neumann spike is 1650 K (ZND predicts 1528 K). Spatial distribution of pressure 
at different moments of time is shown in Fig. 11–4. Pressure at the end of the Taylor wave predicted by 
the LES model is 0.48-0.51 MPa and the theoretical (Taylor, 1950; Nettleton, 1987) estimate is 5.4 MPa.

Figure 11–4. Pressure dynamics of 29.05% planar hydrogen-air detonation along 100 m channel, D=0.1m.
The combustion energy has to be released behind the maximum peak of pressure to feed it (Fig. 11–5). 
In the ZND theory detonation speed depends on a value of heat release only when real thermodynamic 
parameters of the mixture are adopted. The correct value of the heat of combustion 3.2 MJ/kg applied 
in this study assures a proper value of the numerical detonation velocity of 1960 m/s.
Figure 11–5. Spatial distribution of detonation pressure and heat release rate at time 24.8 ms (shock is at 49 m), D=0.1 m.
It is worth noting that the simulation results were obtained using extremely large size of numerical 
mesh in a range D=0.1–1.0 m. In spite of the fact that numerical shock and reaction zone are extremely 
thickened on applied grid the general laws of the ZND theory and physical mechanism of detonation 
propagation are conserved in the numerical simulations.

Graphical presentation of grid sensitivity of the LES model of detonation is given in Fig. 11–6 for the 
maximum overpressure in the detonation wave and the detonation propagation velocity. Detonation 
parameters exhibit non-monotonic change with CV size. Tenfold increase of a cell size doesn’t change 
the detonation parameters on more than about ±5%.

Impulse is another important parameter for explosion safety engineering along with maximum overpressure 
(Baker et al., 1983). For instance, it is of importance when predicting the extent of building destruction. 
Figure 11–7 demonstrates temporal change of simulated overpressure dynamics and impulse as a function 
of mesh size. Simulated impulse is more sensitive to mesh size compared to the maximum pressure because 
of thickening of the numerical shock with cell size. Indeed, the von Neumann pressure spike magnitude in 
our approach is independent of mesh while the thickness of detonation front increases proportional to CV 
size (4–5 CVs). 
Figure 11–7. Simulated detonation overpressure and impulse dynamics for different control volumes: D=0.1, 0.5, 1 m.
The most common numerical schemes used to model detonation front are the second order Godunov 
scheme with Flux Corrected Transport method (Oran and Boris, 2001), or the MUSCL scheme with TVD 
method (Eto et al., 2005). Accurate simulation of detonations requires sophisticated numerical methods. 
These methods must be able to capture strong shocks and accurately compute the turbulent shear flows 
which arise as a result of the explosion. Genin et al. (2005) states that shock capturing methods have 
significant numerical dissipation to prevent generating unphysical oscillations near the shock, but this 
dissipation tends to smear out fine-scale turbulent structures in the flow. On the other hand, highly 
accurate numerical schemes developed to simulate smooth flow tend to produce unphysical oscillations 
in regions of strong gradients and/or discontinuities. In numerical studies of detonation with inclusion 
of Arrhenius chemistry it was pointed out that the physical phenomena obtained from calculation are 
highly dependent on grid resolution and numerical scheme (Fryxell et al., 2005).
Numerical models, schemes and codes need to be thoroughly tested and for this a Riemann problem 
(RP) is commonly used. It gives an exact solution to non-linear equations like the Euler equations. The 
solution consists of constant regions separated by waves. For the Euler equations the exact solution of 
the RP is well-known, self-similar, and consists of a combination of three wave types: shocks, rarefaction 
waves, and contact discontinuities. In our simulations AUSM+ numerical scheme is used which gives a 
proper solution of the strong shocks (Liou, 1996). High pressure region of 10 MPa was set as an initial 
condition at the distance of 2 m from the closed end. On the right hand side overpressure was equal 0. 
The CFL number in this numerical experiment was 0.05. 3D calculation domain of 1x1x10 m consists 
of hexahedral CVs of 0.1x0.1x0.1 m with the symmetry conditions at walls, ground and ceiling.

Figure 11–8 shows the comparison between analytical solution and numerical simulation of the Riemann 
problem on the grid with longitudinal CV size 0.1 m. It can be seen that the LES model of planar 
detonation and the numerical scheme applied are able to reproduce pressure levels in a shock and a 
rarefaction wave. However, they give up the resolution of the shock leading front compared to physical 
reality and the analytical solution. The increased thickness of a leading front of the numerical shock 
should be properly addressed by any model to keep the physics of the phenomenon right.
Figure 11–8. Comparison between analytical solution and numerical simulation of the  
Riemann problem for cbb 10 MPa discontinuity decay, time 2.58 ms.
Similar result is observed in LES of the detonation wave. Indeed, in spite of the fact that a leading 
front of the detonation shock is located over 3–5 CVs the simulated pressure peak is equal to the von 
Neumann spike in the ZND theory. In the ZND theory detonation propagates with velocity of the leading 
precursor shock, i.e. von Neumann spike. The LES model requirement to reproduce the von Neumann 
pressure peak provides physically correct detonation propagation velocity. The model is realised in a 
way that all combustion energy is released behind the shock to feed the shock peak rather than disperse 
released energy among parts of numerical leading front of the shock when pressure and reaction fronts 
are collapsed into one non-physical complex (or partially overlap).
Many of recent numerical studies of detonation were focused on resolving of detonation wave fine 
structure and modelling of detailed chemistry. They require fine mesh of few microns (Tsuboi, 2007). 
For hydrogen safety engineering such mesh is impractical and the resolution of the fine structure of 
detonation wave has to be given up. It is more important to reproduce with reasonable accuracy the 
overall parameters of detonation such as maximum pressure, impulse and propagation velocity.
From the physical point of view it is very important to reproduce von Neumann peak in numerical 
simulations. Indeed, it will provide correct value of detonation propagation velocity and arrival times. From 
the engineering point of view the influence of von Neumann pressure spike on the structural response is 
usually neglected since the spike thickness is of such a short length compared to typical length of structural 
element, that an influence on the structural response is small in comparison with the effects of the main 
loading produced by the Taylor-Zeldovich pressure profile behind the detonation front (Shepherd, 2006).

In the open atmosphere or semi confined geometries any consideration of detonation pressure effect and its 
decay with distance should be carried out with taking into account the fact that total destruction of buildings 
occur at pressures above 70100 Pa and impulse above 770 Pa×s (Baker et al., 1983; Dorofeev, 2005). For 
life safety considerations a maximum pressure in a shock or decaying blast wave plays an important role.
Figure 11–9 shows comparison between the LES model predictions and the ZND theory overpressures 
for lean hydrogen-air mixtures down to 20% of hydrogen concentration by volume. The discrepancy is 
within acceptable for engineering purposes 5%.

Screening simulation is performed on a tetrahedral mesh of characteristic size of 0.5 m in a calculation 
domain 6x6x25 m. Simulated overpressure is less than obtained on the hexahedral mesh in longer 
calculation domain. The von Neumann pressure peak is 25.5 MPa, i.e. 5% below the ZND theory. 
Propagation velocity as well is slightly under predicted by about 5% with value 1850 m/s. The effect of 
tetrahedral grid on the overall detonation parameters should be studied further in more detail.
Concluding remarks
The LES model of large scale planar detonation is proposed for prediction of pressure effects at large scale 
accidents. The combustion model is based on the progress variable equation with the gradient method 
for the source term modelling and doesn’t require Arrhenius chemistry. The LES model is verified against 
solutions of the ZND theory. Simulated detonation velocity, von Neumann spike pressure, Chapman-
Jouguet pressure and Taylor wave parameters are in good agreement with theoretical values. There is 
some over prediction of impulse with increase of cell size. The model is practically grid independent in 
the range of tested cell sizes 0.1-1.0 m and doesn’t require any “calibration” of the heat of combustion and 
the ratio of specific heats. This original approach to detonation simulation is proved to work successfully 
for the planar case. The next step is application of this methodology to LES of spherical large scale 
hydrogen-air detonation.

11.2.3.1. Detonation of 30% hydrogen-air mixture in 5.23 m hemisphere
The LES model was applied to simulate a hemispherical detonation of 30% hydrogen-air mixture in a 
polyethylene balloon of radius 5.23 m propagating through unobstructed environment (Groethe et al., 
2005). Direct initiation of the detonation was at the ground level. Figure 11–10 gives snapshots of the 
experiment. Blast wave overpressure dynamics was recorded at distance 15.6 m and the corresponding 
blast wave impulse was calculated.

Figure 11–10. Hemispherical detonation of 30% hydrogen-air mixture in a polyethylene balloon of radius 5.23 m (Groethe, 2005).
The detonation was initiated in the same way as in deflagration simulation, i.e. by the increase of the 
progress variable from 0 to 1 in one control volume, corresponding to position of the ignition source. 
The duration of numerical initiation corresponds to the detonation wave propagation through half of 
the ignition control volume. Calculation domain was meshed using tetrahedral control volumes close 
to ignition area and hexahedral control volumes everywhere else.
The detonation (Chapmen-Jouguet) velocity for 30% hydrogen-air mixture determined according to 
(Brown and Shepherd, 2004) is D=1977  m/s. The simulated combustion wave propagation velocity, 
smoothed through oscillations, is shown in Fig. 11–11 (Makarov et al., 2007b). The simulated velocity 
is in good agreement with theoretical value. There are higher values of the detonation wave propagation 
velocity immediately after initiation and at the end of the process (probably due to the decrease of a 
number of control volumes in numerical combustion front at the end of the process).

Neither von Neumann (2.85 MPa) no Chapmen-Jouguet (1.53 MPa) pressures for planar detonation were 
achieved in this simulation of spherical detonation. The maximum simulated detonation overpressure is 
about 0.9 MPa. Unfortunately, experimental data on the maximum detonation pressure is absent. Pressure 
distribution within combustion area is an agreement with theoretically expected solution (Nettleton, 
1987): Tailor expansion wave occupies about 50% of the burnt mixture radius with the pressure at the 
end of the expansion wave about 0.4 MPa.

11.2.3.2	 Detonation of 29.05% hydrogen-air mixture in 2.95 m radius balloon
Here results of a simulation of spherical detonation in a 2.95 m radius balloon are presented (Zbikowski, 2010).
Experiment
In experiment by Pförtner and Schneider (1984) hemispherical balloon with radius 2.95 m was filled 
with 29.05% hydrogen-air mixture. Measurements of pressure inside the balloon were carried out with 
piezoelectric transducers of frequency 450 kHz (PBC) and in the fare field piezoresistive transducers 
with frequency 70 kHz (Kistler). Detonation was initiated by the 50 g of high explosive charge which 
was located in the middle of the balloon. Detonation velocity measured in the experiment was 1956 
m/s. Initial temperature 304K.

Numerical details
The calculation domain was created according to the experimental description (Pförtner and Schneider, 
1984) and meshed using uniform hexahedral mesh targeting uniform control volumes with size 
0.1x0.1x0.1 m, in the area of hydrogen-air mixture. In the volume defined as a far filed (only air) 
tetrahedral CVs are used with the size of 1 m. Numerical detonation was initiated by defining pressure 
20 MPa, temperature 6000 K and progress variable c = 1 in one CV. Non-slip boundary conditions 
for the momentum equations, adiabatic boundary conditions for the energy equation, and zero flux 
boundary conditions for the progress variable equation were imposed at all walls. At the moment of 
ignition mixture was quiescent, u = 0 m/s. Hydrogen and air mass fractions were YH2 = 0.0278 and Ya 
= 0.9721 respectively. The progress variable was set to c = 0 in the whole domain except the area of 
detonation initiation.
The Fluent 6.3 software was used as an engine for the LES model simulations. The combustion model 
was implemented through the User Defined Function in Fluent. The double precision parallel version 
of the solver was used with explicit linearization of the governing equations. To compute the convective 
fluxes the Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM+) by Liou (1996) and the central difference 
scheme for diffusion terms were applied. The 4th-order Runge-Kutta scheme was used for time stepping. 
The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number was equal to 0.1. In the area of pressure gradient adaptive 
mesh was used with 2 levels of adaptation. Model was normalized by scaling and adaptation was initiated 
dynamically every 5th iteration. Coarsen Threshold was 0.4 and Refine Threshold 0.8.
Results
Results of 3D simulation of detonation are presented below. Records were taken by the pressure gauges P1, 
P2, P3 located at a distances 0.75, 1.5, 1.75 m from the ignition point respectively (all inside the balloon). 
Data from three pressure transducers was used to compare results of the simulation with experiments.
Figure 11–14 shows the pressure dynamics of the detonation front at the distance 0.75 m from the 
ignition source. Simulated detonation velocity is reproduced the experimental velocity (1954 m/s). 
Maximum experimental pressure peak is 2.85 MPa yet in simulation it is only 1.45 MPa (theoretical von 
Neumann spike for planar detonation is PvN = 2.69 MPa, i.e. the detonation was overdriven). Another 
reason for the lower simulated overpressure is overlapping of numerical reaction front and shock front 
in the vicinity of the initiation point.

Detonation pressure was registered by the gauge positioned at half of the balloon radius, i.e. 1.5 m 
(see Fig. 11–15). At this location the experimental detonation is stabilized and propagates with the CJ 
detonation velocity of 1954 m/s. The maximum pressure peak for spherical detonation is practically the 
same for both the experiment and simulations, i.e. 1.9 MPa. This is below PvN for the planar detonation, 
and above PCJ=1.45 MPa.

Simulations showed similar results for pressure decay in the Taylor wave at different locations. However, 
there is some delay of pressure in the numerical Taylor wave. This could be explained by thickened 
numerical reaction zone and leading shock front when solving large-scale problems.

Figures 11–17 and 11–18 present the dynamics of decaying blast wave from the detonation at the distance 
of 3.25 m and 5 m from the ignition source respectively. Velocity of the blast wave is well resolved due 
to a proper simulation of the energy release. Maximum peak of pressure for the first location (3.25m) is 
under predicted by 30% (Fig. 11–17), probably due to the coarse mesh. Simulated blast wave pressure 
dynamics at distance 5 m from the ignition source (Fig. 11–18) is in good agreement with the experimental

LES of detonation in the RUT facility
The LES model was tested against two large-scale experiments in the RUT facility (Zbikowski et al., 2010). 
The facility was 27.6 × 6.3 × 6.55 m compartment with complex three-dimensional geometry. Experiments 
with 20% and 25.5% hydrogen-air mixture and different location of direct detonation initiation were 
simulated. Sensitivity of 3D simulations to control volume size and type were tested and found to be 
stringent compared to the planar detonation case. The maximum simulated pressure peak was found to 
be lower than the theoretical von Neumann spike value for the planar detonation and larger than the 
Chapman-Jouguet pressure thus indicating that it is more challenging to keep numerical reaction zone 
behind a leading front of numerical shock for curved fronts. The simulations demonstrated agreement 
with the experimental data. 
11.2.4.1. Experiments
Large scale hydrogen-air detonation experiments were carried out in the RUT facility and described in 
(Breitung et al., 1996) and later in more detail in (Efimenko and Gavrikov, 2007). The RUT facility is a 
steel-lined reinforced concrete structure shown in Fig. 11–19.

hydrogen-air mixture initiated at point B. High-frequency measurement system, including piezoelectric 
pressure transducers Kistler, models 701 and 7031, tenso-resistive pressure transducers ENDEVCO, models 
8511A-5K and 8530B-1000, signal amplifiers, cables, digital transient recorder DL-2800 and computer for data 
processing and storage were used. Signal was recorded with the DL-2800 register with a sample rate of 5 ms. 
Two lines of pressure transducers were arranged inside the experimental volume. The first one was placed 
in the canyon (lower part of the facility) and included transducers 1-6 (line 1). The second one was placed 
in the channel with transducers 7–11 (line 2). The pressure transducers number 2 to 5 were located on 
the longitudinal wall of the canyon, and the transducers 7 to 11 on the opposite wall of the channel as 
depicted in Fig. 11–19 (right). Transducers 1, 6, 11 were placed in the middle of the transversal walls. 
High explosive charges of 200 g were used as initiators being located at distance 80 cm from the floor and 
50 cm from the wall. The initial mixture temperature and pressure were 20oC and 0.1 MPa respectively 
in both tests. Mixing of hydrogen and air was assured by fans. Hydrogen concentration and mixture 
uniformity were checked taking samples from two different points of the flammable volume. The non-
uniformity was less than 0.5% by volume of hydrogen. 
11.2.4.2. Modelling and numerical details
The applied LES detonation model was verified previously against analytical solution of the ZND theory 
for the planar detonation wave and provided an excellent agreement for von Neumann spike pressure, 
detonation propagation velocity, etc. The LES detonation model demonstrated the capability to capture 
strong shocks and reproduce major detonation parameters. The model was found to be grid independent 
for planar detonation in a wide range of CV sizes from 10 cm to 1 m.

The aim of these simulations is a validation of the LES detonation model, which is fully compatible with 
the LES deflagration model described above, in a complex geometry. The detonation model is paired to 
the LES multi-phenomena deflagration model. The gradient method for the source term in the progress 
variable equation is applied. It does not resolve real reaction front, but represents it as a monotonous 
change of the progress variable through a number of CVs (Laskey et al., 1988). The numerical requirement 
is that the flame front thickness simulated by the gradient method is about 4-5 CVs. It is clear that the 
real detonation wave thickness is given up when large control volumes are used to tackle industrial scale 
problems without any adjustment of simulation parameters.
The chemical kinetics is incorporated within the detonation velocity value, which was pre-calculated 
using the Shock and Detonation (SD) Toolbox (http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/EDL/public/cantera/html/
SD_Toolbox/index.html) built on the CANTERA software (Goodwin, 2005). Thermodynamic and 
thermokinetic data used in the simulations are presented in Table 11–2 along with near stoichiometric 
29.05% hydrogen-air mixture data.

To make the heat release in the numerical reaction zone able to feed the leading shock one should keep 
the simulated reaction (heat release) zone behind the peak of the leading shock without their numerical 
“non-physical” overlapping that “kills” the von Neumann spike in numerical simulations when this physics 
is ignored. Failure to address it results in under-prediction of maximum pressure in the von Neumann 
spike. To achieve this in simulations the source term for the progress variable is kept equal to zero when the 
pressure derivative with time in the considered CV is positive (before the pressure peak), and is “switched 
on“ only when the pressure derivative with time becomes negative (close or after the pressure peak). 
The calculation domain was designed according to the experimental description and meshed using hexahedral 
CVs targeting uniform grid with the mesh size 0.1x0.1x0.1 m totalling 237,005 CVs. In simulations the 
detonation was initiated by defining pressure 20 MPa, temperature 6000 K and progress variable c=1 in the 
region of 0.2x0.2x0.2m (2x2x2 CVs) at the ignition source location. Such initiation allows creation of the strong 
shock which is then supported by the heat release in the reaction front. Model itself is not sensitive to ignition 
parameters like it is in Arrhenius chemistry based codes. Pressure and temperature are needed to create strong 
shock wave which is then supported by the reaction heat release. Otherwise value of the source term in the 
energy equation is too small to support decaying leading shock on a course mesh. This phenomenon can be 
explained by numerical diffusion which cannot be avoided when shock is curved.

The non-slip boundary condition for the momentum equations, adiabatic boundary conditions for the 
energy equation, and zero flux boundary condition for the progress variable equation were imposed at 
the walls. The mixture is initially quiescent, u=0 m/s. Hydrogen and air mass fractions for 20% and 25.5% 
are Y20%H2= 0.017 and Ya= 0.983, and Y25.5%H2= 0.024 and Ya= 0.976 respectively. The progress variable is 
set to c=0 in the whole domain except the area of detonation initiation. Heat release is kept behind the 
maximum peak of pressure by defining condition that the source term in the progress variable equation 
in front of this peak is equal to zero and allowed to grow in cells behind the peak.
The Fluent 6.3 software was used as a CFD engine for the LES model realisation. The double precision 
parallel version of the solver was used with explicit linearization of the governing equations. To compute 
the convective fluxes the AUSM+ (Liou, 1996) and the central difference scheme for diffusion terms were 
applied. The 4th-order Runge–Kutta scheme was used for time stepping. The CFL number was equal to 
0.05. The so low number was chosen to guarantee stability and converging solution in situation when 
the characteristic speed in the problem is the detonation speed, which is higher than the speed of sound 
used by default in the CFL number.
11.2.4.3. Results
Important conclusions of the study (Zbikowski et al., 2008) are: the LES model of detonation is practically 
grid independent for planar detonation simulations in the range of cell sizes 0.1–1.0 m; and it doesn’t 
require any “calibration” of the heat of combustion and the ratio of specific heats (no Arrhenius chemistry 
parameters dependence either due to use of pre-calculated detonation velocity), which are often applied 
in other models to better reproduce experimental data. 
The profiles of numerical detonation wave structure for the planar detonation of near stoichiometric 
29.05% hydrogen-air mixture at different distances from the initiation plane (calculation domain 100 
m, mesh size 0.1 m) is shown in Fig. 11–20. It is seen that simulated structure of the detonation wave is 
practically the same at different locations of the 1000 CVs calculation domain. This demonstrates that 
there is no “numerical diffusion” in simulations that could be attributed as very useful inherent feature 
to the gradient method coupled with the progress variable equation.

The progress variable graphs in Fig. 11–20 demonstrate that the number of CVs in the combustion front 
is about 10. The maximum pressure peak is located at CV number 10 where the progress variable is just 
between 0.1 and 0.2. This behaviour does not have any influence on the propagation of detonation wave 
while heat release is located between values 0.45 and 0.6 of the progress variable c. The physics behind 
this arrangement is to keep the heat release behind the maximum peak of pressure (von Neumann spike) 
to overcome the numerical requirement for any numerical front (here the shock front) to be spread at 
least through 4-5 cells and thus allow released heat to feed the leading numerical shock.
The verification procedure used previously for the stoichiometric hydrogen-air planar detonation was 
applied in this study for 20% and 25.5% hydrogen-air planar detonations before proceeding to the 
simulations in the RUT facility. Simulations of planar detonations were performed in the calculation 
domain of 3x3x100 m with one closed end and hexahedral mesh with CV size 0.5x0.5x0.1 m (36,000 
CVs) for both 20% and 25.5% of hydrogen-air mixtures. Simulated detonation velocity, von Neumann 
spike pressure, Chapman-Jouguet pressure and Taylor wave parameters (0.375 of PCJ) are in a good 
agreement with the theoretical values (see Table 11–3).

model for 20%, 25.5%, 29.05% hydrogen-air mixture.
A profile of simulated pressure and the progress variable for the planar detonation is shown in Fig. 
11–21. The thickness of the simulated detonation wave is of the order of one meter due to the large 
cell size of 0.1 m used and the requirement of the model to keep the reaction zone (area of changing 
progress variable) behind the von Neumann spike. Yet, the maximum peak of pressure (von Neumann 
spike), temperature and detonation velocity in CJ plane are grid independent for this model in case of 
planar detonation (Zbikowski, 2008). It is also seen that the progress variable profile starts to change 
after the pressure peak, giving rise to the heat release behind the leading shock, which is a key element 
of the model realisation as only with such model arrangements the heat released in the reaction front 
feeds the leading shock.

The simulated pressure profile for each pressure transducer is in a reasonably good agreement with 
the experiment if the strong initiation pressure peak is taken into account. Velocity of the numerical 
detonation is somewhat under predicted (6%). This could be caused by the overlapping to some extent 
of the numerical reaction zone and the numerical shock in 3D simulations and/or quite large difference 
in numerical shock and reaction zone radii in the beginning of the process especially when control 
volume size is as large as 10 cm. Another possible reason is the behaviour of the detonation wave in 
the experiment. The experimental results show overdriven detonation in the pressure gauge 5, affected 
by the spherical detonation blast created by the initiator in the experiment. Then the detonation wave 
decays to the theoretical value of CJ detonation velocity (1703 m/s) as it is in the experiment. 
Looking into detailed structure of the pressure dynamics we may see that when the detonation wave is 
reflected from the wall (second pressure peek on the pressure dynamics of gauge 2, Fig. 11–22) simulation 
results over predict the maximum peak of the experimental reflected pressure wave. This is probably 
caused by thickened numerical shock when CV size of 0.1 m is applied and related increase of density of 
the unburned mixture in location of numerical gauge 2. Thus, simulations with shock reflections might 
require finer mesh for better reproduction of pressure transients with this model.
In the second simulated experiment with 25.5% hydrogen-air mixture the detonation was initiated at 
location “B” (see Fig. 11–19, right). Figure 11–23 shows comparison of simulated and experimental 
pressure dynamics for sensors 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, located at the wall of the channel along the main way 
of the experimental detonation wave propagation. The detonation wave propagates from the right to 
the left. In this experiment multiple reflections affect the pressure readings in gauges 2–6, so they are 
excluded from the analysis.

Figure 11–23 shows that the pressure signal of the simulated detonation and rarefaction waves are close to 
the experimental transients with all major experimental peaks having their simulated pairs. Over-predicted 
detonation velocity, observed in pressure gauge 11, in the authors opinion is due to behaviour of the 
detonation wave in the channel bend. According to the experimental results in a laboratory scale (Frolov 
et al., 2007) a detonation front propagating in a bend tube is subjected to temporary attenuation with the 
velocity drop of about 15%, which is then followed by the recovery of the propagation velocity in the straight 
tube section downstream from the bend. This seems to be the case in the considered experiment: arrival of 
the detonation to gauge 11, located after the bend, is “delayed”, though the detonation velocity during its 
further propagation along the straight part of the channel is close to the theoretical value. Experimental and 
simulated pressure peak arrival time in location of pressure transducers 10, 9, 8, 7 are in a perfect agreement, 
which means the simulated propagation velocity is in the agreement with the experimental one. Maximum 
peak of pressure in the leading front is somewhat under predicted. This is particularly pronounced in the 
pressure gauge 11, 9, and 7 (leading peak pressure 1.7, 2.1 and 2.1 MPa respectively), and in a less degree 
in sensor 8 (leading peak pressure 2.4 MPa). In location of sensor 10 the simulated leading peak pressure 
reached value is 3.6 MPa, i.e. higher than the theoretical von Neumann pressure 2.67 MPa. This is thought 
due to reflection effect of thickened numerical detonation wave.
The instantaneous simulated pressure, progress variable and temperature profiles for 25.5% hydrogen-air 
mixture detonation between gauges 10 and 11 are shown in Fig. 11–24. 
Figure 11–24. Detonation parameter profile in 3D simulations (25.5% hydrogen-air mixture, CV size 0.1 m, hexahedral grid):  
left – overpressure (vertical line identifies the pressure peak) and the progress variable, right – overpressure and temperature.
Figure 11–24 shows that the leading shock wave smoothly increases to the maximum value due to 3D 
effects, which start to affect the detonation wave propagation in this experimental geometry. Yet the 
model is capable to handle discontinuities on the large control volumes. This result is achieved due to 
the proper amount of the released energy, calculated using the gradient method, and the proper location 
of the energy release within the detonation wave structure, i.e. behind the leading shock wave. It is also 
seen that the mentioned above requirement for the numerical reaction front thickness resolution by at 
least 4–5 CVs is valid for the leading shock front too.

Maximum pressure peak differs for each pressure gauge located along the wall for both experiment and 
simulations in two processed tests (see Fig. 11–25). Simulated pressures follow the experimental trend 
with some under-prediction except pressure gauge 7 where computed pressure peak is slightly higher. 
There is a noticeable under-prediction in location of gauge 5 that is easy to explain by the vicinity of the 
initiating charge to this pressure gauge.

(25.5% hydrogen-air mixture); right – gauges 5–1 (20% hydrogen-air mixture).
Sensitivity of the LES model in 3D simulations to the CV size and mesh type was tested using 25.5% 
hydrogen-air mixture detonation. CV size varied between 0.05 and 0.5 m, and hexahedral and tetrahedral 
meshes were used in simulations. The simulations were unstable for CV size bigger than 0.1 m. The 
same situation is for the tetrahedral mesh with CV size in the range 0.1–0.5 m. The grid sensitivity 
analysis showed that for CV size larger than 0.1 m numerical diffusion starts to play a dominant role in 
3D complex geometries when the model is applied. This behaviour can be clearly seen during the shock 
wave diffraction. Computational cost of simulations with CV size less than 0.1 m for both hexahedral 
and tetrahedral meshes was prohibitively high. 
The sensitivity of the model was tested with one level of adaptive to the pressure gradient mesh refinement 
(CV size in refinement 0.05 m). The pressure and temperature profiles obtained with the refined grid are 
shown in Fig. 11–26. Measurement of the numerical pressure and temperature were obtained in pressure 
gauge number 10. The general shape of the pressure profiles is similar to those obtained without grid 
refinement (see Fig. 11–24). The simulated von Neumann pressure peak is equal to its theoretical value.

11.2.4.4. Concluding remarks
The LES detonation model, developed and verified earlier against the ZND theory of planar detonation has 
been tested against two large scale detonation experiment in the RUT facility with uniform hydrogen-air 
mixtures of 20% and 25.5% by volume of hydrogen in air and different location of detonation initiation. 
The LES model of detonation is based on the progress variable equation coupled with the gradient method 
where chemical kinetics is incorporated into the value of the detonation velocity. Simulations are in good 
agreement with experimental pressure transients in different locations within the experimental facility 
for both mixtures and ignition locations. 
Detonation velocity in simulations is not constant that could be attributed to the effect of walls on the 
solution of the progress variable equation. Differently to the planar detonation simulations, the LES model 
demonstrates a degree of grid dependency for the 3D detonation propagation in the complex geometry 
with reflections: maximum size of CV for simulation stability was equal 0.1 m using hexahedral CVs. 
The grid adaptation improves results of large scale detonation simulations without significant increase 
of the computational effort. The presented LES detonation model is considered as a platform for a future 
DDT model development and as a contemporary tool for hydrogen safety engineering.

Safety strategies and mitigation techniques
12	 Safety strategies and mitigation 
techniques
The main general safety strategy to deal with hydrogen leaks is to minimize its mass flow rate and piping 
diameter, and “let it go” to prevent its accumulation to a hazardous level when a flammable hydrogen-
air mixture represents unacceptable hazards and risks. This chapter gives some examples of hydrogen 
safety engineering.
The standard “Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems” (ISO/TR 15916:2004) gives some 
general recommendations to minimize the severity of the consequences of a potential mishap: 
• Minimize the quantity of hydrogen that is stored and involved in an operation;
• Isolate hydrogen from oxidizers, hazardous materials and dangerous equipment;
• Identify and, if possible, separate or eliminate potential ignition sources;
• Separate people and facilities from the potential effects of fire, deflagration, or detonation 
originating from the failure of hydrogen equipment or storage systems;
• Elevate hydrogen systems or vent them above other facilities;
• Prevent hydrogen-oxidizer mixtures from accumulating in confined spaces (under the eaves 
of roofs, in equipment shacks or cabinets, or within equipment covers or cowlings);

Safety strategies and mitigation techniques
• Minimize personnel exposure by limiting the number of people exposed, the time that the 
personnel are exposed; 
• Use of personal protective equipment;
• Use of alarms and warning devices (including hydrogen and fire detectors), and area control 
around a hydrogen system;
• Practice good housekeeping, such as keeping access and evacuation routes clear and keeping 
weeds and other debris away from hydrogen systems;
• Observe safe operational requirements, such as working in pairs when operating in a 
hazardous situation.
Design of buildings and rooms in which hydrogen is stored or used should address safety issues such as 
the following, in order to minimize the hydrogen hazards: pressure relief systems to mitigate deflagrations 
by venting technique (ISO/TR 15916:2004). Explosion‑proof equipment should be used in all locations 
described above unless it can be shown that it is not necessary, or required by local, regional or national 
regulations (ISO/TR 15916:2004).
12.1.	
Inherently safer design of fuel cell systems
Inherently safer design is an approach that focuses on reducing or eliminating hazards associated with 
the product or the process. Consider how a fuel cell (FC) safety system could be improved by reducing 
hazards without interfering the technology itself. Unfortunately, current fuel cell systems are often 
designed using piping diameters of 5–15 mm and pressures of 0.5–1.5 MPa without consideration of 
hazards. The mass flow through a 5 mm diameter orifice at storage pressure of 0.5 MPa can be calculated 
using the under-expanded jet theory, and is about 6 g/s. For a pipe of 15 mm diameter and pressure 1.5 
MPa the mass flow rate is 170 g/s.
Now let us estimate the mass flow rate for a 50 kW FC system for providing energy for large facilities such 
as hotels, hospitals, office buildings, and multi-family dwellings. Assuming that an electrical efficiency of 
FC is 45%, and the upper heat of reaction (combustion) of hydrogen with air is [(286.1 kJ/mol)/( 2.016 
g/mol)] = 141.92 kJ/g, the mass flow rate for the FC functioning at maximum power can be calculated 
as (50 kW)/0.45/(141.92 kJ/g)=0.78 g/s. For example, this mass flow rate can be provided at a pressure 
0.5 MPa through a restrictor in the storage or piping system with an orifice diameter of only about 1.8 
mm, or at pressure 0.2 MPa through a diameter orifice of about 2.9 mm. 
The separation distance for unignited release can be estimated as proportional to a nozzle diameter and 
square root from a storage pressure. Thus, decrease of pipe diameter from 15 mm to 2.9 mm and pressure 
from 1.5 MPa to 0.2 MPa could decrease separation distance by more than 14 times!

Safety strategies and mitigation techniques
Further analysis can be performed to compare separation distances for these two options: option 1 – 
pressure 0.5 MPa and pipe diameter 1.8 mm; option 2 – 0.2 MPa and 2.9 mm. The ratio of separation 
distances for unignited releases in option 1 and 2 in assumption of full bore rupture can be estimated 
as 0.98, i.e. they are practically the same. These examples clearly demonstrate advantages of the science-
informed safety design of hydrogen and fuel cell systems to essentially reduce separation distances without 
affecting the performance parameters of FC.
12.2.	
Mitigation of release consequences
The similarity law (5–21) with substitution of hydrogen density in the real nozzle exit is a simple and 
thoroughly validated tool for hydrogen safety engineering for both expanded and under-expanded round 
jets. For example, let us calculate a diameter of a pressure relief device (PRD) for a forklift onboard storage 
to obey the following safety strategy. In the case of an upward release from the onboard storage at 35 MPa 
we would like to exclude formation of a flammable layer under a ceiling which is 10 m above the PRD. 
To realize this strategy the concentration on the jet axis at distance 10 m should be equal or below 4% 
by volume (corresponding mass fraction of hydrogen is Cax=0.00288). The density of hydrogen in the 
nozzle exit, calculated by the under-expanded jet theory for the storage pressure of 35 MPa, is rN=14.6 
kg/m3. Thus, the diameter of the PRD can be calculated straight forward from the similarity law (5–21) 
as equal or less than 1.5 mm

To finalize this safety strategy for use of hydrogen-powered forklifts in the warehouse a requirement to 
fire-resistance rating of the onboard storage tank must be formulated and testing carried out. Indeed, the 
fire-resistance rating should be greater than the blowdown time (the time to empty the storage vessel) 
of the storage tank to exclude its catastrophic failure in the case of external fire. It is clear that the use 
of a PRD with a larger diameter would create a flammable cloud or a jet flame with higher hazards, e.g. 
dangerous overpressure during “delayed ignition” or deflagration of initial cloud, and associated risks.
12.3.	
Reduction of separation distances for high debit pipes
Since 1969 Air Products operates in Houston (Texas, USA) 232 km of hydrogen pipelines of diameter 
11.4 cm to 22 cm at a pressure of 5.8 MPa. For these parameters the under-expanded jet theory gives 
the maximum notional nozzle exit diameter 120 cm and mass flow rate 133.2 kg/s (for a scenario of full 
bore rupture of pipe with 22 cm internal diameter at 5.8 MPa). 
Distance to 4% by volume of hydrogen in the horizontal jet, if it is assumed to be in the momentum-
controlled regime, can be calculated graphically directly from the nomogram in Fig. 5–6 or by the 
following simple equation (assuming for air rS=1.204 kg/m3)

Safety strategies and mitigation techniques
where D is the maximum actual diameter of the release (0.22 m). The density in the nozzle at storage 
pressure of 5.8 MPa can be calculated by the under-expanded jet theory, e.g. from the lower graph in 
Fig. 5–6, and is equal to rN=2.87 kg/m3. Thus, the distance to 4% by volume calculated by the above 
equation, i.e. in the assumption of momentum-dominated jet, is 587 m!
Fortunately, the jet is not momentum-controlled at the range of concentration of interest. Indeed, the 
Froude number calculated by flow parameters at the notional nozzle exit is Fr=5.1. Analysis of Fig. 5–8 
with Fr=5.1 gives that the jet becomes buoyancy-controlled (intersection of vertical line from Fr=5.1 
with the curve denoted “Downward”) at Log (x/D)=2 (notional nozzle is applied to use Fig. 5–8), i.e. at 
distance x=100.D=120 m! This distance is 4.9 times shorter compared to the safety distance determined 
without accounting for the effect of hydrogen buoyancy.
12.4.	
Mitigation by barriers
Sandia National Laboratories performed a series of experimental and numerical studies in order to assess 
the effectiveness of barriers to reduce the hazard from unintended releases of hydrogen, including within 
the HYPER project international collaboration. For the conditions investigated, i.e. 13.79 MPa source 
pressure and 3.175 mm diameter round leak, the barrier configurations studied were found to reduce 
horizontal jet flame impingement hazard by deflecting the jet flame, reduce radiation hazard distances 
for horizontal jet flames and reduce horizontal unignited jet flammability hazard distances. 
For the 1-wall vertical barrier and 3-wall barrier configurations the simulations of the peak overpressures 
from ignition were found to be approximately 40 kPa on the release side of the barrier while approximately 
3-5 kPa on downstream backside of the barrier.
12.5.	
Mitigation of deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT)
Strategies to minimize the potential for flame acceleration or detonation include (ISO/TR 15916:2004):
• Avoiding confinement and congestion where flammable hydrogen-air mixtures might form;
• Using flame arrestors, small orifices, or channels to prevent deflagration and detonation 
from propagating within a system;
• Using diluents, like steam or carbon dioxide, or oxygen depletion techniques where possible 
and water spray or mist systems to retard flame acceleration. This recommendation of the 
standard (ISO/TR 15916:2004) should be taken with care as hydrogen-air flames are difficult 
to quench and they can burn or even accelerate around the droplets in heavy sprays of water 
(Shebeko et al., 1990);
• Reduce size of a system where possible to narrow detonability limits.

Safety strategies and mitigation techniques
A low carbon economy will more and more exploit fuels with addition of hydrogen. Knowing that hydro-
gen combustion is prone to DDT, especially at large scales, there are serious concerns on how technologies 
could be made safer. For such kind of applications, the safety strategy can be, in the author’s opinion, 
to organize and control the process of combustion of a hydrogen-contained mixture in a way that the 
mixture supplied to the burner is between the lower flammability limit and the lower detonability limit.
12.6.	
Prevention of DDT within a fuel cell
In experiments of Pro-Science (Friedrich et al., 2009) in a mock up of fuel cell (FC), a significant flame 
acceleration was recorded leading to a high overpressure, for the total injected mass of 15 g and 25 g, 
sufficient for complete demolition of the experimental rig. Both experimental and numerical studies 
of the FC mock up suggest that the total injected mass should be less than 6 g for the configuration 
studied in order to keep overpressures below 10 to 20 kPa. Missile effects could be still possible for this 
6 g inventory. So, an inventory of 1 g seems a good target for safety for accidental release within this 
FC mock up. This research result can be used to formulate requirements to a shut down safety system 
for fuel cells.
The feed line pressure and diameter of a pipe and restrictor orifice should, by design, limit the mass flow 
rate of hydrogen to a technological level that is required for the FC to function. The release duration, due 
to the time required to detect the leak and operate the valve should be reduced as much as possible to 
exclude release of more than 1 g of hydrogen. An estimate shows that for a 50 kW fuel cell, that needs 
consumption rate of hydrogen just below 1 g/s, a leak detection time and time of shutting down supply 
line should be together less than 1 s. Any reduction of this time would have a positive impact on safety. 
This requirement is difficult to achieve for currently available sensors. Innovative systems of leak detection, 
e.g. based on supply pressure fluctuation analysis, have to be developed and implemented to provide 
acceptable level of safety. The grid obstacle, used in the Pro-Science experiments to mimic the congestion 
within real fuel cell, led to strong flame acceleration (Friedrich et al., 2009). The congestion of internal 
space of the FC enclosure should be avoided as much as possible by a careful design.
12.7.	
Detection and hydrogen sensors
The addition of an odorant to hydrogen would ease the detection of small leaks. However, this is not 
practicable in most situations, e.g. this would poison an expensive catalyst in fuel cells. Moreover, this is 
not feasible for liquefied hydrogen as any added substance would be in a solid state at the temperature 
of liquefied hydrogen of 20 K. Hydrogen fire detection can be based on registration of infrared radiation 
of flames which are not seen in a day light.

Safety strategies and mitigation techniques
In 2009 INERIS (France) conducted a test program within the HYPER (2008) project based on 
the international standard parts IEC 61779-1&4 (1998) and aimed at assessing the performance of 
commercially available hydrogen detectors. These devices were of electrochemical and catalytic types, i.e. 
the two types most often used in industry. The catalytic sensor was 5 times faster than the electrochemical 
one to respond to a sudden exposure of hydrogen. However, the response time was approximately 10 s 
for the catalytic sensor and 50 s for the electrochemical sensor. These figures also apply for the recovery 
time. In many practical scenarios this long time is hardly acceptable.
Catalytic detectors studied within the HYPER (2008) project were also prone to loss of sensitivity and 
drift of zero after a prolonged exposure to hydrogen. This emphasizes the need to regularly calibrate these 
devices. Higher humidity tended to increase the reading of the catalytic detector for constant hydrogen 
content. The catalytic detector was very sensitive to the presence of carbon monoxide but the interfering 
was only temporary, i.e. when the CO exposure ceases the detector behaves in an ordinary way.
Research by Joint Research Centre, Institute for Energy, The European Commission within the HYPER 
(2008) project demonstrated that the time required by the electrochemical sensor to respond to hydrogen 
exposure of known concentration becomes longer when the gas flow rate is reduced, i.e. it could be twice 
longer by solely reducing the flow rate from 100 to 30 ml/min. This finding is particularly important 
when the sensor is intended to control the formation of an explosive atmosphere within a FC cabinet.
There is another issue related to faster catalytic sensors that is not yet sufficiently addressed in literature. 
This is a potential to ignite hydrogen-air mixture with high concentrations of hydrogen by the sensor. The 
ignition of hydrogen-air mixtures with high content of hydrogen by recombiners was already observed 
(Blanchat and Malliakos, 1998).
A variety of methods and sensor types are commercially available to detect the presence of hydrogen 
(ISO/TR 15916:2004). Many of these detectors are suitable for use in automatic warning and operating 
systems, see for example ISO 26142:2010 for details concerning stationary systems.

Concluding remarks
Concluding remarks
We tend to treat our current fuels, notably petrol and natural gas, quite ‘casually’ due to familiarity with 
them, whereas hydrogen is viewed with some trepidation as it is ‘unknown’ and wrongly linked as a 
reason to past ‘catastrophic’ events like Hindenburg dirigible. The inevitability of the hydrogen economy 
and the important role of hydrogen safety, especially the hydrogen safety engineering, in its underpinning 
are introduced. Hydrogen safety engineering is defined as an application of scientific and engineering 
principles to the protection of life, property and environment from adverse effects of incidents/accidents 
involving hydrogen. These princ.iples have to be formulated and tools to carry out hydrogen safety 
engineering developed and validated against experimental data
Hydrogen is not more dangerous or safer than other energy carriers. Hydrogen is different and requires 
professional safety knowledge and skills at all stages starting from design of hydrogen and fuel cell (HFC) 
systems through their certification, permitting and commissioning to new safety culture in use of these 
technologies by public.
Safety of HFC systems and infrastructure is a paramount for their commercial competitiveness and public 
acceptance. The activities of the European Network of Excellence HySafe (2004–2009) and currently of 
the International Association for Hydrogen Safety (IA HySafe) along with national and international 
programs, e.g. funded by European Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking and US Department 
of Energy, are a firm guarantee of the progress in closing numerous knowledge gaps, development of 
innovative safety strategies and breakthrough engineering solutions. The progress achieved so far cannot 
be interpreted as a closure of safety issues. New processes of hydrogen production, storage, transportation 
and use in HFC systems will appear that will require both basic and applied research.
Hazards and associated risks have to be fully understood and addressed. The role of risk assessment 
methods should not be overestimated in the absence of reliable statistics on probable potential benefits for 
the business and in no way at the cost of public safety. Car manufacturers carrying out own competitive 
research on hydrogen-powered vehicles should be more open and cooperative in solving common for 
all safety problems. The opinion “there are no safety issues” for HFC technologies should be considered 
as not professional and misleading public. 
The examples of innovative safety strategies and inherently safer engineered systems should be 
disseminated as wide as possible instead. The test results of safety performance of hydrogen-fuelled 
vehicles should be publicly available and activities on improvement of safety characteristics should be 
continuously reported to public to prevent rumours and non-professional interpretations.

Concluding remarks
Conclusion is drawn that onboard storage and pressure relief devices (PRDs) currently available for 
hydrogen-powered vehicles should be redesigned to mitigate potential accidents especially in confined 
spaces as garages, car parks, maintenance shops, tunnels, etc. This requires at least reduction of mass 
flow rate during release through the PRD and increase of fire resistance rating of the onboard storage 
from current 1–6 minutes by an order of magnitude. The underestimation of the role of safety for HFC 
products and following accidents, which will happen as for any other technology, would have catastrophic 
consequences and thus imply further delays for the commercialization. That is what no one working in 
the field of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies wants to happen.
Inherently safer design of HFC systems has to be the primary goal of developers. For example, parameters 
of piping system, i.e. pressure and internal diameter, have to be minimized to provide technological 
requirements on mass flow rate but not more. It is demonstrate that separation distances could be reduced 
by more than order of magnitude if system developers are educated in carrying out hydrogen safety 
engineering. Another example of inherently safer design is as follows. The safety strategy for burners 
and turbines using mixtures of hydrogen with other gases could be a provision that the mixture supplied 
to the combustion device is between the lower flammability limit and the lower detonability limit to 
sustain combustion yet to prevent detonation.

Concluding remarks
There is a clear need in the development of an overarching performance-based standard for carrying 
out hydrogen safety engineering of HFC applications and infrastructure that is scientifically informed. 
Indeed, current RCS in the field are fragmented, are far from being complete, have grown in number, 
are prepared mainly by the industry and for the industry, are difficult to interpret, and are sometimes 
contradicting available knowledge being by definition at least 3 years old. This novel for hydrogen safety 
standard should have organizational and technical frameworks on how to carry our hydrogen safety 
engineering and gather together in one place description of technical sub-systems, e.g. through so-called 
“published documents” similar to British standard BS 7974 approach for fire safety engineering (BSI, 
2001). The concept of the standard and the structure of technical sub-systems allow for their continuous 
update by research results and are convenient for new people to get rapidly into the emerging profession 
of hydrogen safety engineering. 
Professional workforce having a higher education degree to lead hydrogen safety activities in industry, 
regulatory bodies, research organizations and academia is another important element in securing the 
safe introduction of HFC technologies to the market.
The main progress in closing knowledge gaps in hydrogen safety science and engineering can be briefly 
summarized, based on the research results presented in this book, as follows. 
For non-reacting hydrogen releases:
• The under-expanded jet theory is developed for prediction of flow parameters at the actual 
nozzle and notional nozzle exits. The theory accounts for non-ideal behaviour of hydrogen 
at high pressures by the Abel-Noble equation. For example, the use of the ideal gas law will 
overestimate the hydrogen mass released from 70 MPa storage tank by about 45%. 
• The similarity law for hydrogen concentration decay in both expanded and under-expanded 
momentum-controlled jets is proposed and validated. 
• A methodology to define where a jet transition from momentum- to buoyancy-controlled 
regime takes place is developed. This is of importance to essentially reduce separation 
distance, e.g. for high debit jets from pipelines.

Concluding remarks
For ignitions and hydrogen fires:
• The dimensional correlation for hydrogen jet flame length is developed. The conservative 
estimate of the flame length is 50% longer than the best fit curve. 
• The novel dimensionless correlation for a jet flame length accounting for dependence on Fr, 
Re, M numbers and covering the full spectrum of hydrogen releases, including laminar and 
turbulent flows, buoyancy- and momentum-controlled leaks, expanded and under-expanded 
jets is developed. There are three distinguishable parts in this innovative correlation: 
traditional ascending buoyancy-controlled, traditional momentum-dominated plateau for 
expanded jets, and a new third ascending part that represents under-expanded momentum-
controlled jet fires. The dimensionless flame length in the last part of correlation depends 
on Reynolds rather than Froude number. There is no saturation of the dimensionless flame 
length at value LF/D=230 observed in previous studies with expanded jets, instead reported 
experiments demonstrate values up to LF/D=3000.
• The contradictory statements available in combustion literature about the location of a 
turbulent non-premixed flame tip are clarified. It is established that the flame tip is located 
for momentum-controlled jets (both expanded and under-expanded) at the distance from 
the leak source where the axial concentration of hydrogen in an unignited jet is 11% by 
volume (in the range from 8% to 16%). This is far below the stoichiometric concentration of 
29.5% by volume as was stated previously. 
• The potential of sensors to ignite mixture at high concentration of hydrogen has to be 
addressed from the beginning of hydrogen detector development. Relevant testing methods 
have to be developed and included into RCS.
• The LES model of hydrogen ignition during sudden releases, including to complex 
geometries like T-shaped channel, is validated against experimental observations.
For hydrogen deflagrations and detonations:
• Delayed ignition of hydrogen releases produces highly turbulent deflagration. It has been 
demonstrated in experiments by HSL that with the ignition delay of 0.8 s the release from 
20.5 MPa storage through 9.5 mm orifice generates overpressure of 16.5 kPa for free jet, 42 
kPa if 90o barrier wall is installed, and 57 kPa if 60o barrier is applied. This is comparable 
with the moderate level of damage to structures by overpressure (17 kPa), severe damage 
(above 35 kPa), and total structure destruction (above 83 kPa). At the same series of 
experiments no overpressure was observed for nozzle diameter of 1.5 mm.
• Mitigation by barriers study performed by Sandia National Laboratories for 13.79 MPa 
release through 3.175 mm diameter round leak demonstrated that for different barrier 
configurations the peak overpressure to be approximately 40 kPa on the release side of the 
barrier and only 3–5 kPa on downstream backside of the barrier.

Concluding remarks
• Experimental and numerical studies show that turbulence of mixture during sudden 
release of high pressure hydrogen to the atmosphere has a greater effect on the deflagration 
overpressure than the total amount of released gas or the volume of flammable mixture.
• Deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) phenomenon is not yet studied enough to have 
predictive contemporary models and tools for solving large-scale engineering problems. 
Detonation is the worst case scenario for an accident involving hydrogen and all measures 
should be undertaken to prevent it. Indeed, the energetic equivalent of 1 g of hydrogen is 
quite high, i.e. 28.65 g of TNT.
• Results obtained by Pro-Science during the FP6 HYPER project indicate that the accidental 
release of no more than 1 g of hydrogen inside the fuel cell is a good target for hydrogen 
safety engineers to prevent DDT.
• The LES models of deflagrations and detonations are being developed and validated. They 
can be used as contemporary tools for hydrogen safety engineering.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

Appendix 1. Glossary
Appendix 1. Glossary
Accident is an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance causing loss or injury.
Auto-ignition temperature is the minimum temperature required to initiate combustion reaction of 
fuel-oxidiser mixture in the absence of an external source of ignition.
Boiling point is the temperature to which a fuel must be cooled in order to store and use it as a liquid. 
The normal boiling point (NBP) of a liquid is the case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals 
the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level (1 atmosphere or 101,325 Pa). The standard boiling point 
(SBP) is defined as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 bar (100,000 Pa).
Deflagration and detonation are propagation of a combustion zone at a velocity that is respectively less 
than and greater than the speed of sound in the unreacted mixture.
Equivalence ratio is the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio.
Fire-resistance rating is a measure of time for which a passive fire protection system can withstand a 
standard fire resistance test. 
Flammability range is the range of concentrations between the lower and the upper flammability limits. 
The lower flammability limit (LFL) is the lowest concentration of a combustible substance in a gaseous 
oxidizer that will propagate a flame. The upper flammability limit (UFL) is the highest concentration of 
a combustible substance in a gaseous oxidizer that will propagate a flame.
Flashpoint is the lowest temperature at which the fuel produces enough vapours to form a flammable 
mixture with air at its surface.
Hazard is a chemical or physical condition that has the potential for causing damage to people, property 
and the environment.
Hydrogen safety engineering (HSE) is application of scientific and engineering principles to the protection 
of life, property and environment from adverse effects of incidents/accidents involving hydrogen.
Incident is something that occurs casually in connection with something else. 
Laminar burning velocity is the rate of flame propagation relative to the velocity of the unburned gas 
that is ahead of it, under stated conditions of composition, temperature, and pressure of the unburned gas.

Appendix 1. Glossary
Limiting oxygen index is the minimum concentration of oxygen that will support flame propagation 
in a mixture of fuel, air, and nitrogen.
Mach disk is a strong shock normal to the under-expanded jet flow direction.
Maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of flammable gases and vapours is the lowest value of the safe 
gap measured according to IEC 60079-1-1 (2002) by varying the composition of the mixture. The safe 
gap is the gap width (determined with a gap length of 25 mm) at which in the case of a given mixture 
composition, a flashback just fails to occur.
Minimum ignition energy (MIE) of flammable gases and vapours is the minimum value of the electric 
energy, stored in the discharge circuit with as small a loss in the leads as possible, which (upon discharge 
across a spark gap) just ignites the quiescent mixture in the most ignitable composition. For a given 
mixture composition the following parameters of the discharge circuit must be varied to get the optimum 
conditions: capacitance, inductivity, charging voltage, as well as shape and dimensions of the electrodes 
and the distance between electrodes. 
Normal Temperature and Pressure (NTP) conditions are: temperature 293.15 K and pressure 101.325 
kPa.
Quenching distance is the maximum distance between two parallel plates that will extinguish a flame 
passing between the plates.
Quenching gap is the spark gap between two flat parallel-plate electrodes at which ignition of combustible 
fuel-air mixtures is suppressed. The quenching gap is the passage gap dimension requirement to prevent 
propagation of an open flame through a flammable fuel-air mixture that fills the passage.
Permeation is the movement of atoms, molecules, or ions into or through a porous or permeable 
substance.
Separation distance is the minimum separation between a hazard source and an object (human, 
equipment or environment) which will mitigate the effect of a likely foreseeable incident and prevent a 
minor incident escalating into a larger incident.
Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance, both at 
the same temperature and pressure.
