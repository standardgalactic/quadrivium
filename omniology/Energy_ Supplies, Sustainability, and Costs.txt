least reduced energy dependence, became increasingly
important. In 2003 the United States was again at war
with Iraq, and by 2004 imported oil accounted for a
record 57.8% of U.S. oil consumption. (See Figure 1.6.)
That year net imports of petroleum (that is, total imports
minus total exports) reached 25.5 quadrillion Btu. (See
Table 1.2.)
Although the United States imports energy, primarily
in the form of oil, it exports small amounts of energy in
the form of coal and oil. In 2004 coal exports totaled 1.3
quadrillion Btu, about 28% of U.S. energy exports. (See
Figure 1.7 and Table 1.2.) The United States also exports
some oil (petroleum). The reasons for exporting oil are
complicated but have to do with the cost of transporting
Alaskan oil; the sale of certain types of petroleum used to
make steel; and exchanges with Canada and Mexico of
crude products for refined products.
FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION PRICES
Production prices are the value of fuel produced. The
combined production prices of fossil fuels (crude oil,
natural gas, and coal) slowly declined from 1949 through
1972. (See fossil fuel composite, Figure 1.8.) These
prices then increased dramatically from 1973 through
1981, and fell just as dramatically through 1998: The
composite value of all fossil fuel prices (in real dollars,
which account for inflation) dropped from $4.64 per
million Btu in 1981 to $1.46 per million Btu in 1998, a
decrease of more than two-thirds. (See Table 1.3.) This
huge drop created economic problems in fuel-producing

TABLE OF CONTENTS
PREFACE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii
CHAPTER 1
An Energy Overview. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1
Energy is essential to human existence. The need for ever-increasing
amounts of energy has resulted in some of the most profound social
changes in human history. This chapter explores some of those
changes, as well as current and future trends in energy production
and consumption, public policy, and environmental concerns.
CHAPTER 2
Oil . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19
This chapter focuses on one of the planet’s most important nat-
ural resources: oil. The discussion includes such topics as domestic
and international production and consumption, price and demand
trends, fluctuations in employment, and environmental concerns
stemming from oil spills.
CHAPTER 3
Natural Gas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35
At the beginning of this century natural gas was second only to
coal in the share of U.S. energy produced. This chapter covers the
processes involved in producing, storing, and delivering natural
gas; current trends in production and consumption; and predic-
tions about the future of the gas industry.
CHAPTER 4
Coal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51
Coal first rose to prominence as an energy source in the nine-
teenth century. After a period in which it was supplanted by oil as
the world’s primary energy source, coal regained some of its
popularity during the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s.
Besides tracing coal’s rise, fall, and resurgence, this chapter dis-
cusses the different types and classifications of coal; mining meth-
ods; trends in price, production, and consumption; health and
safety risks associated with mining; and the numerous environ-
mental concerns that surround the use of this fossil fuel.
CHAPTER 5
Nuclear Energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65
Nuclear energy offers significant advantages over fossil fuels, but there
are also significant downsides, including the disposal of radioactive
waste and the risk of nuclear-plant meltdowns, such as the Chernobyl
disaster of 1986. The future of nuclear power is also discussed.
CHAPTER 6
Renewable Energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 81
Renewable energy sources—including hydropower, solar and
wind energy, geothermal power, and hydrogen—replenish them-
selves naturally. They are all attractive alternatives to fossil-fuel
sources, but they are not without their disadvantages. This chap-
ter details some of these alternative sources, trends in their use,
and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
CHAPTER 7
Energy Reserves—Oil, Gas, Coal, and Uranium . . . . 97
Because oil, gas, coal, and uranium are nonrenewable resources—
they are formed more slowly than they are consumed—it is
important to know how much of each is recoverable, or poten-
tially recoverable, from the earth. This chapter addresses that
issue, focusing on domestic and international reserves of these
resources; worldwide trends in the exploration for them; and the
environmental impact of that exploration.
CHAPTER 8
Electricity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .107
Electricity is one type of energy produced using the resources
discussed in previous chapters. Among the topics discussed are
domestic and international production and consumption of elec-
tricity; the attempt at deregulation of electric utilities in the Uni-
ted States; and projected trends in the domestic electric industry.
CHAPTER 9
Energy Conservation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .119
Public health is inextricably linked to the health of the environ-
ment, and the health of the environment is largely determined by
how we use and dispose of our energy sources. This chapter
analyzes this complex web, focusing on global warming, manu-
facturers’ attempts to build more efficient automobiles and appli-
ances, and projected trends in energy conservation.

PREFACE
Energy: Supplies, Sustainability, and Costs is part of
the Information Plus Reference Series. The purpose of
each volume of the series is to present the latest facts on a
topic of pressing concern in modern American life. These
topics include today’s most controversial and most stu-
died social issues: abortion, capital punishment, care for
the elderly, crime, health care, energy, the environment,
immigration, minorities, social welfare, women, youth,
and many more. Although written especially for the high
school and undergraduate student, this series is an excel-
lent resource for anyone in need of factual information on
current affairs.
By presenting the facts, it is Thomson Gale’s inten-
tion to provide its readers with everything they need to
reach an informed opinion on current issues. To that end,
there is a particular emphasis in this series on the pre-
sentation of scientific studies, surveys, and statistics.
These data are generally presented in the form of tables,
charts, and other graphics placed within the text of each
book. Every graphic is directly referred to and carefully
explained in the text. The source of each graphic is pre-
sented within the graphic itself. The data used in these
graphics are drawn from the most reputable and reliable
sources, in particular from the various branches of the
U.S. government and from major independent polling
organizations. Every effort was made to secure the most
recent information available. The reader should bear in
mind that many major studies take years to conduct and
that additional years often pass before the data from these
studies are made available to the public. Therefore, in
many cases the most recent information available in
2007 dated from 2004 or 2005. Older statistics are some-
times presented as well, if they are of particular interest
and no more-recent information exists.
Although statistics are a major focus of the Informa-
tion Plus Reference Series, they are by no means its only
content. Each book also presents the widely held positions
and important ideas that shape how the book’s subject is
discussed in the United States. These positions are
explained in detail and, where possible, in the words of
those who support them. Some of the other material to be
found in these books includes: historical background;
descriptions of major events related to the subject; relevant
laws and court cases; and examples of how these issues play
out in American life. Some books also feature primary
documents or have pro and con debate sections giving the
words and opinions of prominent Americans on both sides
of a controversial topic. All material is presented in an
evenhanded and unbiased manner; the reader will never
be encouraged to accept one view of an issue over another.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The United States is the world’s largest consumer of
energy in all its forms. Gasoline and other fossil fuels power
the nation’s cars, trucks, trains, and aircraft. Electricity
generated by burning oil, coal, and natural gas—or from
nuclear or hydroelectric plants—runs America’s lights, tele-
phones, televisions, computers, and appliances. Without a
steady, affordable, and massive amount of energy, modern
America could not exist. This book presents the latest
information on U.S. energy consumption and production,
compared with years past. Controversial issues such as the
U.S. dependence on foreign oil, the possibility of exhaust-
ing fossil fuel supplies, and the harm done to the environ-
ment by mining, drilling, and pollution are explored.
Energy: Supplies, Sustainability, and Costs consists
of nine chapters and three appendixes. Each of the major
elements of the U.S. energy system—such as coal,
nuclear power, renewable energy sources, and electricity
generation—has a chapter devoted to it. For a summary of
the information covered in each chapter, please see the
synopses provided in the Table of Contents at the front
of the book. Chapters generally begin with an overview
of the basic facts and background information on the
Energy
vii

chapter’s topic, then proceed to examine subtopics of
particular interest. For example, Chapter 7: Energy
Reserves—Oil, Gas, Coal, and Uranium begins with a
description of the different ways in which natural
resource reserves are measured and their reliability. The
chapter then moves into an examination of proved U.S.
reserves of oil and natural gas. Statistics on known and
estimated reserves are presented, as are projections of
how long these reserves will last if they continue to be
consumed at current rates. The controversial possibility of
drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is
discussed. This is followed by an examination of the
methods, costs, and consequences of oil and gas explora-
tion. After this are sections on U.S. coal and uranium
reserves. Then the chapter presents similar statistics on
worldwide reserves of oil, coal, gas, and uranium. Read-
ers can find their way through a chapter by looking for the
section and subsection headings, which are clearly set off
from the text. Or, they can refer to the book’s extensive
Index, if they already know what they are looking for.
Statistical Information
The tables and figures featured throughout Energy: Sup-
plies, Sustainability, and Costs will be of particular use to the
reader in learning about this topic. These tables and figures
represent an extensive collection of the most recent and
valuable statistics on energy production and consumption;
for example: the amount of coal mined in the United States in
a year, the rate at which energy consumption is increasing in
the United States, and the percentage of U.S. energy that
comes from renewable sources. Thomson Gale believes that
making this information available to the reader is the most
important way in which we fulfill the goal of this book: to
help readers understand the topic of energy and reach their
own conclusions about controversial issues related to energy
use and conservation in the United States.
Each table or figure has a unique identifier appearing
above it, for ease of identification and reference. Titles for the
tables and figures explain their purpose. At the end of each
table or figure, the original source of the data is provided.
In order to help readers understand these often com-
plicated statistics, all tables and figures are explained in
the text. References in the text direct the reader to the
relevant statistics. Furthermore, the contents of all tables
and figures are fully indexed. Please see the opening
section of the Index at the back of this volume for a
description of how to find tables and figures within it.
Appendixes
In addition to the main body text and images, Energy:
Supplies, Sustainability, and Costs has three appendixes.
The first is the Important Names and Addresses directory.
Here the reader will find contact information for a number
of organizations that study energy. The second appendix
is the Resources section, which is provided to assist the
reader in conducting his or her own research. In this
section the author and editors of Energy: Supplies, Sus-
tainability, and Costs describe some of the sources that
were most useful during the compilation of this book. The
final appendix is this book’s Index.

CHAPTER 1
AN ENERGY OVERVIEW
Energy is essential to life. Living creatures draw on
energy flowing through the environment and convert it
to forms they can use. The most fundamental energy
flow for living creatures is the energy of sunlight, and
the most important conversion is the act of primary
production, in which plants and phytoplankton convert
sunlight into biomass by photosynthesis. Earth’s web of
life, including human beings, rests on this foundation.
—Energy in the United States: 1635–2000, U.S. Energy Infor-
mation Administration (2001)
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Before the Twentieth Century
People have always found ways to harness energy,
such as using animals to do work or inventing machines
to tap the power of wind or water. The industrialization
of the modern world was accompanied by the widespread
use of such fossil fuels as coal, oil, and natural gas.
Significant use and management of energy resulted
in one of the most profound social changes in history
within a few generations. In the early 1800s most Amer-
icans lived in rural areas and worked in agriculture. The
country ran mainly on wood fuel. One hundred years
later, most Americans were city dwellers and worked in
industry. America had become the world’s largest produ-
cer and consumer of fossil fuels, had roughly tripled its
use of energy per capita, and had become a global super-
power.
The United States has always been a resource-abundant
nation, but it was not until the Industrial Revolution in the
mid-1800s that the total work output of engines surpassed
that of work animals. As the country industrialized, coal
began to replace wood as a primary fuel. Then petroleum
and natural gas began to replace coal for many applications.
The United States has since relied heavily on these three
fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas.
The Twentieth and Early Twenty-First Centuries
For much of its history the United States has been
nearly energy self-sufficient, although small amounts of
coal were imported from Britain in colonial times.
Through the 1950s domestic energy production and con-
sumption were nearly equal. During the 1960s consump-
tion slightly outpaced production. In the 1970s the gap
widened considerably, narrowed somewhat in the early
1980s, and then widened year after year. By 2004 the gap
between domestic energy production and consumption
was quite significant. (See Figure 1.1.) Since the 1970s
energy imports have been used to try to close the gap
between energy production and consumption. However,
America’s dependence on other countries for energy has
created significant problems.
OIL CRISIS IN THE 1970S. In 1973 the United States
supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War, which was
fought between Israel and neighboring Arab countries.
In response, several Arab nations cut off exports of oil to
the United States and decreased exports to the rest of the
world. The embargo was lifted six months later, but the
price of oil had tripled from the 1973 average to about
$12 per barrel. (See Figure 1.2.) Not only did Americans
(and others around the world) face sudden price hikes for
products produced from oil, such as gasoline and home
heating oil, but they faced temporary shortages as well.
The energy problem quickly became an energy crisis,
which led to occasional blackouts in cities and industries,
temporary shutdowns of factories and schools, and fre-
quent lines at gasoline service stations. The sudden
increase in energy prices in the early 1970s is widely
considered to have been a major cause of the economic
recession of 1974 and 1975.
Oil prices increased even more in the late 1970s. A
revolution in Iran resulted in a significant drop in Iranian
oil production from 1978 to 1981. During this same
period the Iran-Iraq war began, and many other Persian
Energy
1

Gulf countries decreased their oil output as well. Com-
panies and governments began to stockpile oil. As a
result, prices continued to rise and reached a peak in
1981. (See Figure 1.2.)
OIL PRICES FALL IN THE 1980S. In early 1981 the U.S.
government responded to the oil crisis by removing price
and allocation controls on the oil industry. By no longer
controlling domestic crude oil prices or restricting
exports of petroleum products, it allowed the marketplace
and competition to determine the price of crude oil.
Therefore, domestic oil prices rose to the level of foreign
oil prices.
As a result of these increasingly high prices, individuals
and industry used less oil, stepped up their conservation
efforts, or switched to alternative fuels. The demand for
crude oil declined. However, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), and particularly Saudi Arabia,
cut its output during the first half of the 1980s to keep the
price from declining dramatically. (In 2006 the member
countries of OPEC were Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.)
In 1985 Saudi Arabia moved to increase its market
share of crude oil exports by increasing its production.
(Saudi Arabia was and still is the world’s largest produ-
cer and exporter of oil and is a key member of OPEC.)
Other OPEC members followed suit, which resulted in a
glut of crude oil on the world market. Crude oil prices fell
sharply in early 1986, and imports to the United States
increased.
THE UPS AND DOWNS OF OIL PRICES FROM THE 1990S
THROUGH 2002. In August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait. The
United Nations responded by placing an embargo on all
crude oil and oil products from both countries. Oil prices
rose suddenly and sharply, but non-OPEC countries in
Central America, western Europe, and Asia, along with
the United States, stepped up their production to fill the
gap in world supplies. After the United Nations (UN)
approved the use of force against Iraq, starting in October
1990, prices fell quickly. (See Figure 1.2.)
The collapse of Asian economies in the mid-1990s
led to a further drop in the demand for energy, and
petroleum prices dipped sharply in the late 1990s. OPEC
reacted by curtailing production, which boosted prices in
2000. (See Figure 1.2.) World crude oil prices then
declined through 2001 as global demand dropped because
of weakening economies (especially in the United States)
and reduced demand for jet fuel following the September
11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. Fear of an
increased worldwide economic downturn also added to
the decline in crude oil prices.
In late 2002 attacks and counterattacks between
Palestinians and Israelis caused concerns that Iraq might
halt its crude oil shipments to countries that supported the
Jewish state of Israel over Islamic Palestine. Addition-
ally, concerns existed that the Middle East region might
become destabilized should the United States invade Iraq,
which has the second-largest oil reserve in the world.
Moreover, Venezuelan oil workers went on strike, which
cut off exports from Venezuela. These three factors were
the primary causes of the rise in crude oil prices by the
end of 2002. (See Figure 1.2.)
VOLATILITY AND RECORD HIGHS IN OIL PRICES
FROM 2003 TO 2006. In early 2003 a U.S. war with Iraq
seemed imminent. In addition, because of a cold winter
and the Venezuelan strike, U.S. crude oil inventories had
declined. As a result the price of crude oil rose to nearly
$40 per barrel in February 2003, the highest in twenty-
nine months. When the war began on March 19, 2003,
Iraqi oil fields were shut down. Other oil-producing
countries stepped up production to offset the shortfall,
however. In addition, the Venezuelan strike had ended.
The price of oil declined dramatically to about $27 per
barrel by the beginning of May 2003. (See Figure 1.2.)
The lower price did not prevail, however. By June
2003 the price of oil rose above $30 per barrel, largely
because supplies of crude oil were low and demand was
high: Summer, when Americans drive the most, was just
starting. The price of crude oil continued to climb over
the summer and was pushed higher in the fall when the
U.S. dollar sank to a record low against the euro. By
December 2003 it had risen to nearly $34 per barrel. (See
Figure 1.2.)

An Energy Overview
Energy

In 2004 crude oil prices continued to rise because of
political uncertainty, the weakened U.S. dollar, the
weather, and tight supplies. Increases reflected growing
demand from the world’s three largest oil consumers—
the United States, China, and Japan—as well as concern
about terrorist attacks in Spain, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia, and other areas. Moreover, sabotage of Iraq’s
northern
oil
pipelines
prevented
the
country
from
producing the amount of oil that was expected. By
March 2004 the price soared to a thirteen-year high of
about $38 per barrel. By August the price of crude
reached more than $45 per barrel. Then in September
Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf of Mexico, forcing the eva-
cuation of oil workers from offshore platforms and delay-
ing oil tankers from Venezuela. By October 2004 a barrel
of crude oil cost more than $50 for the first time. (See
Figure 1.2.)
In March 2005 sabotage forced Iraq to close the
northern pipeline it used to export crude oil. In the
following months OPEC agreed to increase its production
to allow more oil into the world market to help reduce
prices. In August 2005, however, Hurricane Katrina hit
the Gulf Coast of the United States, severely affecting oil
and natural gas production and oil refining there. (See
Figure 1.2.) Hurricane Rita struck the Gulf Coast a month
later. Because of the hurricanes, more than a quarter of
U.S. oil refining capacity was shut down. In response,
President Bush directed the Department of Energy (DOE)
to release as much as 30 million barrels of crude oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. (See Chapter 2.) To
bring the price of oil down on the world market, the
International Energy Agency released 60 million tons of
crude oil to the United States. The crude oil price began
to drop, falling below $60 per barrel in October and to
$56 per barrel in November. However, by December
2005 the price bounced back up.
The effects of the hurricanes on U.S. refining capa-
city lasted into 2006. The price of oil was pushed higher

by other events in the world as well. For example, unrest
in Nigeria, the world’s twelfth-largest oil producer,
reduced production by more than half a million barrels
of crude oil per day. By late April 2006, the price of
crude oil surpassed $70 per barrel.
GOVERNMENTAL ENERGY POLICIES
Under President Ronald Reagan
In a televised speech in 1977, President Jimmy Carter,
a Democrat, said the country could have ‘‘an effective and
comprehensive energy policy only if the government takes
responsibility for it and if the people understand the ser-
iousness of the challenge and are willing to make sacri-
fices’’ (Vital Speeches of the Day, 1977). When Republican
Ronald Reagan took over the presidency in 1981, however,
he downplayed the importance of governmental responsi-
bility. His administration sharply cut federal programs for
energy and opposed governmental intervention in energy
markets. For example, the administration did not tax energy
imports, even though doing so might have stimulated
domestic production and conservation. His administration
transferred decision-making to the states, the private sector,
and individuals.
Under President George H. W. Bush
The subsequent Republican administration of Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush continued the Reagan policy.
In 1991 President Bush unveiled an energy policy that
promised to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by
expanding domestic oil production into new areas and
by simplifying the permit process for construction of
nuclear power plants. Both proposals put him in conflict
with conservationists, who objected to increased off-
shore drilling, especially in the coastal plain of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. They also
wanted to see automobile fuel economy improved and
conservation methods stressed, rather than the use of
nuclear power. President Bush’s proposals did not
include government-directed conservation efforts or tax
incentives.
Under President Bill Clinton
The Democratic administration of President Bill
Clinton sought a larger role for government in energy
and environmental issues, although the major energy bills
it proposed were not passed by the Republican-dominated
Congress. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration did
increase funds for alternative-energy research, mandate
new energy-efficiency measures, and enforce emission
standards. The administration also opened up several
areas for oil exploration, including some Alaskan and
offshore areas.
Under President George W. Bush
The major policy goals of the first term of Repub-
lican President George W. Bush were to increase and
diversify the country’s sources of oil and to make energy
security a priority. For example, his administration
encouraged efforts to import more Russian crude oil into
the United States and reopened the U.S. embassy in
Equatorial Guinea, an oil-rich nation.
However, in his second term in office, President Bush
began to advocate policies that would curb dependence on
foreign oil and to promote efforts to make America less
dependent on oil and other fossil fuels. In August 2005 he
signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL-109-
58), which set new minimum energy-efficiency standards
for appliances; provided tax credits for energy-efficient
improvements to homes and for use of energy-efficient
heat pumps, water heaters, and air conditioners; and
sought to reduce the use of energy by the federal govern-
ment. President Bush followed that with an Advanced
Energy Initiative, unveiled in February 2006, the goals
of which were ‘‘promoting energy conservation, repairing
and modernizing our energy infrastructure, and increasing
our energy supplies in ways that protect and improve the
environment’’ (http://www.whitehouse.gov/stateoftheunion/
2006/energy/print/index.html). He also proposed developing
new kinds of alternative-fuel vehicles and using nuclear,
solar, wind, and ‘‘clean coal’’ technologies to help power
homes and businesses.
DOMESTIC ENERGY USAGE
Domestic Production
The total domestic energy production of the United
States—the amount of fossil fuels and other forms of
energy that were mined, pumped, or otherwise originated
in the United States—has more than doubled since 1949,
rising from 31.7 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in
1949 to 70.4 quadrillion Btu in 2004. (See Table 1.1 and
Figure 1.3; Figure 1.3 shows how energy production
related to energy consumption as of 2004.) One quadril-
lion Btu equals the energy produced by approximately
170 million barrels of crude oil. Large production and
consumption figures are given in these units to make it
easier to compare the various types of energy, which
come in different forms.
Table 1.1 and Figure 1.4 show that after declining in
the 1950s, energy produced from coal increased fairly
steadily between 1960 and 2004, with its highest level
recorded in 1998 (23.9 quadrillion Btu). The production
of oil rose from 1949 through 1970, but by 2004 it had
declined to about the level produced in 1950. Natural gas
production quadrupled between 1949 and 1970, from 5.4
quadrillion Btu to 21.7 quadrillion Btu; after peaking at
22.3 quadrillion Btu in 1971, natural gas production has
generally ranged between 17 and 21 quadrillion Btu since

that time. Energy produced from nuclear power rose
dramatically during the 1970s, from 0.2 quadrillion Btu
in 1970 to 3 quadrillion Btu in 1978; it had doubled again
by the early 1990s and reached a peak of 8.2 quadrillion
Btu in 2004. Hydroelectric and biofuel power production
(wood, waste, alcohol) reached their highest levels during
the mid-1990s but have not shown dramatic changes over
the past several decades. At 22.7 quadrillion Btu, more
energy was produced from coal in the United States
during 2004 than from any other energy source. Energy
produced from natural gas was second (19.3 quadrillion
Btu), followed by oil (11.5 quadrillion Btu), and nuclear
electric power (8.2 quadrillion Btu).
Domestic Consumption
Although total domestic energy production more than
doubled from 1949 to 2004, total domestic energy con-
sumption—the amount of energy used in the United
States—more than tripled during that time. (See Figure
1.1.) This increase did not happen in an even progression
over those years. A doubling of domestic energy con-
sumption occurred from 1949 to 1973, increasing from
30 quadrillion Btu to 74 quadrillion Btu. However, after
huge oil price increases in 1973, energy consumption fell,
then rose, and then fell again, eventually returning to 1973
levels by 1984. The level of domestic energy consumption
remained relatively stable through 1986, but following a
drop in the price of crude oil that year, imports of oil
began to rise and energy consumption increased quite
steadily. In 2004 domestic energy consumption reached
an all-time high of 99.7 quadrillion Btu.
One of the reasons that energy consumption has
grown in the United States is the number of people who
use it: According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the U.S.
population grew from 151.3 million in 1950 to 281.4

storage reservoirs is generated by plants other than pumped-storage plants; thus, the associated energy is already accounted for in other data columns in this table (such as 
“conventional hydroelectric power,” “coal,” “natural gas,” and so on). Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding.

million in 2000, an increase of 88%. However, energy
consumption rose by 181% during the same period.
While consumption grew fairly steadily, it slowed some-
what after the 1973 oil crisis. (See Figure 1.1.) For a
time, Americans became more efficient and used less
energy per capita.
Figure 1.5 shows energy production and consumption
flows, including types of energy sources, in 2004. Coal,
which in 1973 accounted for 17% of all energy con-
sumed, accounted for 22.4 quadrillion Btu in 2004, or
22.5% of the total consumed. Nuclear electric power,
which contributed barely 1% of the nation’s consumption
in 1973, had grown considerably by 2004 to 8.2 quad-
rillion Btu, or 8.3% of the total energy consumed.
ENERGY IMPORTS AND EXPORTS
As indicated in Figure 1.1, since the late 1950s
energy consumption in the United States has outpaced
energy production, and the difference has been made up
by importing energy sources. Imports (mainly oil) grew
rapidly from 1953 through 1973 as the U.S. economy
expanded using inexpensive oil. In 1973 net imports of
petroleum reached almost 13 quadrillion Btu.
Although the Arab oil embargo of 1973–74—
coupled with increased oil prices—momentarily slowed
growth in petroleum imports, the general increase con-
tinued, with imports exceeding 19 quadrillion Btu in
1977 through 1979. During those years U.S. dependence
on petroleum imports rose to more than 45% of the
nation’s oil consumption. Despite the lesson of 1973, it
took a second round of price increases in 1979–80,
accompanied by lengthy and frustrating lines at gas sta-
tions, to persuade Americans to become less dependent
on imported oil, conserve resources, or both. By 1985
U.S. dependence on foreign oil had decreased sharply, to
27.3% of oil consumption. (See Figure 1.6.)
After 1985 U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil
increased gradually, as a drop in the price of crude oil
drove up demand. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
the potential threat to the flow of oil to America and other
industrialized nations was one of the reasons the United
States challenged Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert
Storm. However, after the terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001, and the Bush administration’s subsequent ‘‘war
on terror,’’ the concept of energy independence, or at

An Energy Overview

American states, such as Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Montana, West Virginia, and Ohio, and in energy-exporting
countries, such as many Middle Eastern nations, Nigeria,
Indonesia, Venezuela, and Trinidad. However, it was a
windfall for industries that used a lot of energy, such as
airlines, electric utilities, steel mills, and trucking companies.
Since 1998 the combined production prices of fossil fuels
have been generally rising, reaching $3.35 (in real dollars)
per million Btu in 2004.
The production prices of both crude oil (the most
expensive of the fossil fuels) and natural gas followed a
pattern of rising and falling similar to that of the fossil fuel
composite price from 1949 to 2000. (See Figure 1.8.) After
slowly declining from 1949, the crude oil production price
rose dramatically—the most dramatically of all the fossil
fuels—from 1972, when it was $1.94 per million Btu, to
1981, when it topped at $9.27 per million Btu. The price
then tumbled to $1.94 in 1998. (See Table 1.3.) However, it
rose sharply during the next two years, reaching $4.61 in
2000. After a bit of a decline in 2001 and 2002, the crude oil
production price rose to $4.48 in 2003 and $5.86 in 2004.
For natural gas, the price sank from $3.55 per million Btu in

An Energy Overview
Energy

1984 to $1.83 in 1998. It rose to an all-time high of $4.59
per million Btu by 2004. (See Table 1.3.)
The story of coal prices is a bit different from that of the
other fossil fuels. Coal production prices rose from 1970
($0.97 per million Btu) to 1975 ($2.22), but then—unlike
the production prices for natural gas and crude oil—declined
steadily through 2000 ($0.80). Coal prices rose a bit in 2004
to $0.90 per million Btu. (See Figure 1.8 and Table 1.3.)
ENERGY USE BY SECTOR
Energy use can be classified into four main ‘‘end-use’’
sectors: commercial, industrial, residential, and transpor-
tation. Historically, industry has been the largest energy-
consuming sector of the economy. In 2004 industry used
about 33 quadrillion Btu, compared with approximately
28 quadrillion Btu in the transportation sector, 21 quad-
rillion Btu in the residential sector, and 18 quadrillion Btu
in the commercial sector. (See Figure 1.9.)
Within sectors, energy sources have changed over
time. For example, in the commercial sector, coal was
the leading energy source through 1953 but declined
dramatically in favor of petroleum (through 1962) and
then natural gas. In 1990 energy in the form of electricity
pulled ahead as the leading energy source. (See Figure
1.10.) Similarly, coal was the leading energy source in
the residential sector in 1949. (See Figure 1.11.) Natural
gas quickly took over, with petroleum in second place. In
1979 electricity took over second place from petroleum.
Industry used more coal than natural gas or petroleum
through 1957, but after that natural gas and petroleum
took over as nearly equally preferred energy sources.
(See Figure 1.12.) In transportation, reliance on petro-
leum has been increasing since 1949. (See Figure 1.13.)
Not included in the four main sectors of energy con-
sumption is the electric power sector. This sector includes
electric utilities that generate, transmit, distribute, and sell
electricity for use by the other four sectors—in homes,
businesses, and industry. Figure 1.14 shows that most of
the electricity for the United States is generated by burning
coal. The electric power sector consumed approximately 20
quadrillion Btu of coal in 2004, almost all the coal used in
the United States. Electricity is also generated by nuclear
power, natural gas, renewable energy sources (hydroelec-
tric, wood, waste, geothermal, solar, and wind), and petro-
leum. As Figure 1.14 shows, renewable sources generate
very little of the nation’s electricity.
INTERNATIONAL ENERGY USAGE
World Production
World production of energy rose from 215.4 quad-
rillion Btu in 1970 to 417.1 quadrillion Btu in 2003. (See
Table 1.4.) The Energy Information Administration
(EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy stated in its
report Annual Energy Review 2004 (2005) that the
world’s total output of primary energy increased by
94% from 1970 to 2003. In 2002 fossil fuels were the
most heavily produced fuel, accounting for 86% of
all
energy produced worldwide. Renewable

accounted for 8% of all energy produced worldwide that
year, and nuclear power accounted for 6%.
In 2003 the United States, Russia, and China were by
far the leading producers of energy, followed by Saudi
Arabia, Canada, and Iran. (See Figure 1.15.) According
to the EIA, almost all the energy produced in the Middle
East is in the form of oil or natural gas, while coal is a
major source in China. Canada is the leading producer of
hydroelectric power and alone accounted for 12.6% of
world production of this form of power in 2003. France
produces the highest percentage of its energy from
nuclear power—more than 75% in 2004.
World Consumption
Table 1.5 shows world consumption of energy by
region from 1980 to 2003. The five countries singled
out in the table—the United States, China, Russia, Japan,
and Germany—together consumed about 50% of the
world’s total energy supply in 2003. The United States,
by far the world’s largest consumer of energy, used about
98.8 quadrillion Btu in 2003, or 23% of the energy
consumed worldwide. This amount was more than twice
the 45.5 quadrillion Btu consumed in China. Russia
consumed 29.1 quadrillion Btu in 2003.
FUTURE TRENDS IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION,
PRODUCTION, AND PRICES
The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook, which forecasts
energy supply, demand, and prices, is used by decision
makers in the public and private sectors. The EIA’s
projections, through 2030, are based on current U.S.
laws, regulations, and economic conditions.
Total energy consumption in the United States is
projected to increase from 99.7 quadrillion Btu in 2004
to 133.9 quadrillion Btu in 2030, an average annual
increase of 1.1%. (See Table 1.6.) That projection may

An Energy Overview
Energy

be greatly affected by such factors as economic growth
and world oil prices.
The consumption of petroleum, natural gas, coal, and
nonhydroelectric renewable energy sources is expected to
rise significantly from 2004 to 2030. (See Figure 1.16.)
The EIA projects that total petroleum demand will
increase from 20.8 million barrels of oil per day in
2004 to 27.6 million barrels per day in 2030. Coal,
natural gas, and renewable fuels consumption is projected
to grow in part to meet the increased demand for elec-
tricity. Consumption of hydroelectric power and electri-
city generated from nuclear power will remain steady.
The rising consumption of petroleum by Americans is
projected to lead to increasing petroleum imports by the
United States through 2030. (See Figure 1.17.) Gross oil
imports are projected to increase from 13.1 million barrels
per day in 2004 to 18.3 million barrels per day in 2030. The
EIA projects that gross petroleum imports will account for
64% of the total U.S. petroleum supply in 2030.
Electricity prices in the United States are projected to
decline slightly through 2015 (after an initial jump) because
of falling natural gas prices, but will then increase slowly as
natural gas prices go up. (See Figure 1.18.) From 2004 to
2030 coal prices will remain relatively stable, but petroleum
prices will mirror quite closely the rise, then fall, then slow
rise of natural gas prices.

CHAPTER 2
OIL
THE QUEST FOR OIL
On August 27, 1859, Edwin Drake struck oil sixty-
nine feet below the surface of the earth near Titusville,
Pennsylvania. This was the first successful modern oil
well, which ushered in the ‘‘Age of Petroleum.’’ Not only
did petroleum help meet the growing demand for new
and better fuels for heating and lighting, it also proved to
be an excellent fuel for the internal combustion engine,
which was developed in the late 1800s.
Sources of Oil
Almost all oil comes from underground reservoirs.
The most widely accepted explanation of how oil and gas
are formed within the earth is that these fuels are the
products of intense heat and pressure applied over mil-
lions of years to organic (formerly alive) sediments bur-
ied in geological formations. For this reason they are
called fossil fuels. They are limited (nonrenewable)
resources, which means that they are formed much more
slowly than they are used, so they are finite in supply.
At one time it was believed that crude oil flowed in
underground streams and accumulated in lakes or caverns
in the earth. Today, scientists know that a petroleum
reservoir is usually a solid sandstone or limestone forma-
tion overlaid with a layer of impermeable rock or shale,
which creates a shield. The petroleum accumulates within
the pores and fractures of the rock and is trapped beneath
the shield. Anticlines (archlike folds in a bed of rock),
faults, and salt domes are common trapping formations.
(See Figure 2.1.) Oil and natural gas deposits can be
found at varying depths. Wells are drilled to reach the
reservoirs and extract the oil.
How Oil Is Drilled and Recovered
Most oil wells are drilled with a rotary drilling sys-
tem, or rotary rig, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. The rotat-
ing bit at the end of a pipe drills a hole into the ground.
Drilling mud is pushed down through the pipe and the
drill bit, forcing small pieces of drilled rock to the sur-
face, as shown by the arrows in the diagram. As the well
gets deeper, more pipe is added. The oil derrick above the
ground supports equipment that can lift the pipe and drill
bit from the well when drill bits need to be changed or
replaced.
After oil reservoirs have been tapped for several
years or decades, their supply of oil becomes depleted.
Several techniques can be used to recover additional
petroleum, including the injection of water, chemicals,
or steam to force more oil from the rock. These recovery
techniques can be expensive and add to the cost of
producing each barrel of crude oil.
TYPES OF OIL
While crude oil is usually dark when it comes from
the ground, it may also be green, red, yellow, or color-
less, depending on its chemical composition and the
amount of sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and trace minerals
present. Its viscosity (thickness, or resistance to flow) can
range from as thin as water to as thick as tar. Crude oil is
refined, or chemically processed, into finished petroleum
products; it has limited uses in its natural form.
Crude oils vary in quality. ‘‘Sweet’’ crudes have little
sulfur, refine easily, and are worth more than ‘‘sour’’
crudes, which contain more impurities. ‘‘Light’’ crudes,
which have more short molecules, yield more gasoline
and are more profitable than ‘‘heavy’’ crudes, which have
more long molecules and bring a lower price in the
market.
In addition to crude oil, there are two other sources of
petroleum: lease condensate and natural gas plant liquids.
Lease condensate is a liquid recovered from natural gas at
the well. It consists primarily of chemical compounds
called pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons and is generally
Energy
19

blended with crude oil for refining. Natural gas plant
liquids, such as butane and propane, are recovered during
the refinement of natural gas in processing plants.
USES FOR OIL
Many of the uses for petroleum are well known:
gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and lubricants for transpor-
tation; heating oil, residual oil, and kerosene for heat; and
heavy residuals for paving and roofing. Petroleum by-
products are also vital to the chemical industry, ending up
in many different foams, plastics, synthetic fabrics,
paints, dyes, inks, and even pharmaceutical drugs. Many
chemical plants, because of their dependence on petro-
leum, are directly connected by pipelines to nearby refi-
neries.
HOW OIL IS REFINED
Before they can be used by consumers, crude oil,
lease condensate, and natural gas plant liquids must be
processed into finished products. The first step in refining
is distillation, in which crude oil molecules are separated
according to size and weight.
During distillation, crude oil is heated until it turns to
vapor. (See Figure 2.3.) The vaporized crude oil enters the
bottom of a distillation column, where it rises and condenses
on trays. The lightest vapors, such as those of gasoline, rise
to the top. The middleweight vapors, such as those of
kerosene, rise about halfway up the column. The heaviest
vapors, such as those of heavy gas oil, stay at the bottom.
The vapors at each level condense into liquids as they are
cooled. These liquids are drawn off, and processes called
cracking and reforming further refine each portion. Crack-
ing converts the heaviest fractions of separated petroleum
into lighter fractions to produce jet fuel, motor gasoline,
home heating oil, and less-residual fuel oils, which are
heavier and used for naval ships, commercial and industrial
heating, and some power generation. Reforming is used to
increase the octane rating of gasoline.

Refining is a continuous process, with crude oil entering
the refinery at the same time that finished products leave by
pipeline, truck, and train. At most refineries storage capacity
is limited, so if there is a malfunction and products cannot
be refined, the oil may be burned off (flared) rather than
stored. While a small flare is normal at a refinery or a
chemical plant, large flares or many flares likely indicate a
processing problem.
REFINERY NUMBERS AND CAPACITY
One hundred forty-nine refineries were operating in
the United States in 2004, a drop from 336 in 1949 and
324 in 1981. (See Table 2.1.) Refinery capacity in 2004
was about 16.9 million barrels per day, below the 1981
peak of 18.6 million barrels. As of 2004 U.S. refineries
were operating near full capacity. Utilization rates gen-
erally increased from a low of 68.6% in 1981—a period
of low demand because of economic recession—to a high
of 95.6% in 1998. Although capacity fell slightly in the
years since 1998, it was still high in 2004.
As Table 2.1 shows, fewer refineries were operating
in the United States in the early twenty-first century than
in the past. The number dropped partly because the
petroleum industry shut down older, inefficient refineries
and concentrated production in more efficient plants,
which tended to be newer and larger. The industry also
consolidated. For example, the merging of Gulf Oil
Corporation into Chevron Corporation in 1984 led to the
closing of two large refineries. Many other large mergers
and closings followed. According to the Government
Accountability Office (GAO), more than 2,600 mergers
have occurred in the U.S. petroleum industry since the
1990s, ‘‘most frequently among firms involved in oil
exploration and production’’ (GAO Highlights: Energy
Markets,
May
2004;
http://www.gao.gov/highlights/
d0496high.pdf). Industry officials told the GAO that
mergers increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve a
company’s ability to control prices.
An equally important reason for the drop in the
number of U.S. refineries is that some members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
started refining their own oil products in order to obtain
higher
prices
in
the
world
market.
This
strategy,
employed particularly by Saudi Arabia, was intended to
maximize profits.
The last large refinery built in the United States was
completed in 1976, and the last new refinery of any size
began operation in Valdez, Alaska, in 1993. However, the
demand for U.S.-refined petroleum continues to grow.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) stated in
Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (2006; http://www.eia.doe.
gov/oiaf/aeo/) that refinery expansion is expected from
2010 to 2030. A start-up company has announced plans
to open a major new refinery in Arizona in 2010.
LOSS AND VOLATILITY OF OIL INDUSTRY JOBS
The oil industry has experienced both rapid expan-
sions and contractions in its history as it responds to
changes in demand, the development of new technolo-
gies, and other economic imperatives. Corporate mergers,
for example, not only restructure companies and reduce
the number of refineries; they also affect the number of
jobs. Overall the oil and gas extraction industry has been
in an employment decline since reaching a peak of
264,500 in 1982. By 1992, when employees numbered
182,200, for example, about 31% of petroleum jobs had
been lost, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics. As of 2005, employment in the oil and gas extraction
industry segment was 125,900, up 4.7% from the all-time
low of 120,200 experienced in 2003, but 52.4% below the
1982 figure.

Oil
Energy

Oil prices have created some of the volatility experi-
enced in oil employment. In 1996, after a decade of low
oil prices, drilling slowed and the demand for rigs col-
lapsed. New rig construction stopped altogether. Thou-
sands of rigs were left idle, sold for scrap metal, or
shipped overseas, and their crews were put out of work.
Idle rigs became a source of spare parts for those still
operating. In 1997, following a rise in oil prices, the
demand for rigs soared, but by 1998 the market for rigs
had once again dwindled as oil prices sank. Rising oil
prices in 1999 eventually boosted the demand for drilling
equipment. Although crude oil prices declined in 2001,
they rose again in 2003 and reached an all-time high in
April 2006, again spurring demand for oil rigs. According
to Baker Hughes Inc., a company that has tallied weekly
U.S. drilling activity since 1940, domestic oil drilling has
rebounded sharply since late April 1999.
Jobs have also been lost in other parts of the oil
industry. The number of seismic land crews and marine
vessels searching for oil in the United States and its
waters decreased sharply after 1981. In Texas, once the
center of the U.S. oil industry, jobs plummeted from
80,000 in 1981 to 25,000 in 1996. In 1998 the Texas
Comptroller of Public Accounts estimated that for every
$1 drop in the price of oil per barrel, 10,000 jobs were
lost in the Texas economy. That translated into 100,000
jobs lost in Texas from October 1997 to December 1998.
However,
domestic
oil
drilling
rebounded
sharply
between mid-1999 and early 2006, creating an upswing
in numbers of oil industry jobs.
DOMESTIC PRODUCTION
U.S. production of petroleum reached its highest
level in 1970 at 11.3 million barrels per day. (See Table
2.2.) Of that amount, 9.6 million barrels per day were
crude oil. After 1970 domestic production of petroleum
first declined, then rose from 1977 through 1985, and
finally declined fairly steadily. (See Figure 2.4.) By 2004
U.S. domestic production averaged about 7.2 million
barrels per day. Of that amount, 5.4 million barrels per
day were crude oil. Figure 2.5 shows the overall flow of
petroleum in the United States for 2004.
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004 (Energy
Information Administration, 2005; http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/
FTPROOT/multifuel/038404.pdf), the 510,000 producing
wells in the United States in 2004 produced less than eleven
barrels per day per well, significantly below peak levels of
more than eighteen barrels per day per well in the early
1970s. Of the country’s thirteen largest oil fields, seven are
at least 80% depleted.
The United States is considered to be in a ‘‘mature’’
oil development phase, meaning that much of its oil has
already been found. The amount of oil discovered per
foot of exploratory well in the United States has fallen to
less than half the rate of the early 1970s. Geological
studies have estimated that 34% of the country’s
untapped oil resources are in Alaska.
Most domestic oil is produced in only a few states.
Texas, Alaska, Louisiana, California, and the offshore
areas around these states produce about 75% of the
nation’s oil. Most domestic oil (3.6 million barrels per
day, or about 66%) comes from onshore drilling, while
the remaining 1.9 million barrels come from offshore
sources. (See Figure 2.6.) Supplies from Alaska, which
increased with the construction of a pipeline in the late
1970s, have begun to decline. Notice the gap between
‘‘Total’’ and ‘‘48 States’’ in Figure 2.7; the difference is
Alaska’s share of U.S. oil production.
Unless protected wildlife refuges in Alaska are
opened for drilling, U.S. oil production will likely con-
tinue to decline. The Alaskan government and the admin-
istration of President George W. Bush strongly support
drilling for oil in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. But this proposal is highly controversial for
environmental reasons. Legislation to allow the drilling
has been stalled in Congress several times.
Domestic production is also affected by another fac-
tor: the expense of drilling and recovering oil. U.S. pro-
ducers spend about $14 to produce a barrel of oil, not
counting royalty payments and taxes, according to esti-
mates by the U.S. Department of Energy. Middle Eastern
producers, by contrast, drill and extract crude oil from
enormous, easily accessible reservoirs for around $2 per
barrel. When the cost of extraction severely reduces the
profit margin on a barrel of oil, U.S. producers may shut
down their most expensive wells.
DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION
In 2004 most petroleum was used for transportation
(13.6 million barrels per day, or 66%), followed by
industrial use (5.1 million barrels per day; 25%), residen-
tial use (0.9 million barrels per day; 4%), electric utilities
(0.5 million barrels per day; 3%), and commercial use
(0.4 million barrels per day; 2%). (See Figure 2.8.)
Most petroleum used in the transportation sector is
for motor gasoline. In the residential and commercial
sectors, distillate fuel oil (refined fuels used for space
heaters, diesel engines, and electric power generation)
accounts for most petroleum use. Liquid petroleum gas
(LPG) is the primary oil used in the industrial sector. In
electric utilities residual fuel oils are used the most.
A modest decline in residual fuel oil consumption
resulted when electric utilities and plants were converted
to coal or natural gas. An initial decline in the amount of
motor gasoline used, beginning in 1978, was attributed to
the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations,
which required increased miles-per-gallon efficiency in
Energy
Oil
23

new automobiles. However, motor gasoline use has
increased steadily since then, partly because the number
of users has increased and partly because vehicle effi-
ciency has leveled off—consumers once again prefer
less efficient vehicles, such as sport-utility vehicles
(SUVs).
WORLD OIL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
Total world petroleum production has increased
somewhat steadily, reaching 72.5 million barrels per
day in 2004, after a downturn in the early 1980s. (See
Table 2.3.) The largest producer in 2004 was Saudi
Arabia, followed by Russia, the United States, Iran,
China, Mexico, Norway, Venezuela, Nigeria, the United
Arab Emirates, Canada, Kuwait, Iraq, and the United
Kingdom. (See Figure 2.9.) Together, Saudi Arabia,
Russia, and the United States accounted for 32% of the
world’s crude oil production.
Like total world petroleum production, total world
petroleum consumption has increased somewhat steadily,
reaching 80.1 million barrels per day in 2003. (See Table
2.4.) In 2003 the United States was by far the leading
consumer, using 20 million barrels per day, followed by
Japan (5.6 million barrels per day), China (5.6 million
barrels per day), and Germany and Russia (2.7 million
barrels per day each). Other leading petroleum consumers
were
India,
Canada,
South
Korea,
Brazil,
France,
Mexico, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain. (See
Figure 2.10.)
OIL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS
Countries that have surplus oil (Saudi Arabia, for
example) sell their excess to countries that need more
than they can produce, such as the United States, China,
Japan, and western European countries. They sell petro-
leum as both crude oil and refined products, although the

Energy

trend has been moving toward refined products because
they bring higher profits. According to the Annual
Energy Review 2004, the leading supplier of petroleum
to the United States in 2004 was Canada, followed by
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iraq, the United
Kingdom, and Norway.
Though the United States produces a significant
amount of petroleum, it has been importing oil since
World War II (1939–45). Initially, the imported oil was
cheap and available, suiting the demands of a growing
American population and economy. Furthermore, rela-
tively low world crude oil prices often resulted in reduced
domestic oil production: When the world price was lower
than the cost of producing oil from some U.S. wells,
domestic oil became unprofitable and was not produced.
So more oil was imported.
The amount of oil imported to the United States has
fluctuated over the years. Total net imports—imports
minus exports—rose from 4.3 million barrels per day in
1982 to 11.9 million barrels per day by 2004. (See Table
2.2.) In 1985 imported oil supplied only 27.3% of Amer-
ican oil consumption. Just five years later, in 1990, the
proportion had risen to 42% and by 2004 to 57.8%. (See
Figure 1.6 in Chapter 1.)
CONCERN ABOUT OIL DEPENDENCY
In the 1970s U.S. leaders were concerned that so
much of the country’s economic structure, based heavily
on imported oil, was dependent upon decisions in OPEC
countries. Oil resources became an issue of national
security, and OPEC countries, especially the Arab mem-
bers, were often portrayed as potentially strangling the
U.S. economy. Efforts were made to reduce imports by
raising public awareness and by encouraging industry to
create more energy-efficient products, such as auto-
mobiles that got better gas mileage. However, the Ronald
Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations in the
1980s and early 1990s took a different view. They saw
oil supply as an economic, rather than political, issue and
allowed energy issues to be handled by the marketplace.
During the Clinton administration America’s dependence
on foreign oil continued largely because low prices
throughout most of the 1990s set back energy-conservation
efforts. In fact, efficiency gains in automobiles were offset
by the public’s growing preference for large vehicles, such
as SUVs. By 2004 about 65% of the nation’s crude oil
supply (10 million barrels out of a total 15.5 million
barrels per day) came from outside the country. (See
Figure 2.5.) About 44% of that crude oil came from
OPEC nations, according to the Annual Energy Review
2004.
Other factors diverted the public’s attention from
America’s dependence on foreign oil. For example, a
‘‘comfort level’’ had been achieved through oil reserves,
such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the United
States and government-required reserves in Europe, and
the knowledge that, in emergencies, non-OPEC oil pro-
ducers such as the United Kingdom and Norway could
increase their output. Furthermore, increased use of pipe-
lines across Saudi Arabia and Turkey lessened concern
about the disruption of supplies. The pipelines allow
tankers to load oil in the Red Sea or the Mediterranean
Sea, rather than in the potentially dangerous Persian Gulf.
Ships do not have to navigate through the narrow Strait of
Hormuz, where an enemy might be able to stop the flow
of oil.
Concern that America’s dependence on foreign oil,
especially OPEC oil, represented a threat to national
security or national stability changed somewhat after
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It was heigh-
tened by the ‘‘war on terror,’’ the war with Iraq, and the
consequent unrest in Middle Eastern nations. Still,
demand for the product persisted. By early 2006 demand
had grown, oil prices had increased dramatically, and oil
supplies and reserves were tight.
PROJECTED OIL SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION
The
Energy
Information
Administration,
in
its
Annual Energy Outlook 2006, projected that domestic
crude oil production would increase from 5.4 million
barrels per day in 2004 to a peak of 5.9 million barrels
per day in 2014, with the peak attributed to offshore
production, particularly in the deep water of the Gulf of
Mexico. After 2014, production was projected to fall to

4.6 million barrels per day in 2030. However, while
domestic supply was expected to remain relatively con-
stant though 2030, demand was projected to increase
significantly. (See Figure 2.11.) Thus, the agency fore-
sees an increasing dependence on petroleum imports.
STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
Early in the twentieth century a Naval Petroleum
Reserve was established to ensure that the U.S. Navy
would have adequate fuel in the event of war. Large
tracts of government land with known deposits of oil
were set aside. In 1975, in response to the growing con-
cern
over
America’s
energy
dependence,
Congress
expanded the concept and created the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. Oil and refined products are stored in forty-one
deep salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas. (The caverns
are used because oil does not dissolve salt the way water
does.) If the United States suddenly finds its supplies cut
off, the reserves can be connected to existing pipelines
and the oil pumped out.
At the end of 2004 the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
contained 676 million barrels of oil (see Figure 2.12),
equal to fifty-seven days’ worth of imported oil. Figure
2.13 shows a decline in the reserves in terms of days’
worth of net imports, from a high of 115 days in 1985 to
57 days in 2002 through 2004. This decline reflects the
country’s increasing reliance on imports since 1985. As
the nation has imported a greater amount of oil, the days
of net import replacement represented by the amount of
oil in the reserves have dropped.
OIL PRICES
The law of supply (availability) and demand (need)
usually explains the change in the oil price. Higher prices
lead to increased production—it becomes profitable to
operate more expensive wells—and reduced demand—
consumers lower usage and increase conservation efforts.
The factors also work the other way: Reduced demand or
increased supply generally cause the price of oil to drop.

The demand for petroleum products varies. Heating
oil demand rises during the winter. A cold spell, which
leads to a sharp rise in demand, may result in a corres-
ponding price increase. A warm winter may be reflected
in lower prices as suppliers try to clear out their inven-
tory. Gasoline demand rises during the summer—people
drive more for recreation—so gas prices rise as a conse-
quence. Petroleum demand also reflects the general con-
dition of the economy. During a recession, demand for
and production of petroleum products drops. Wars and
other types of political unrest in oil-producing nations
add volatility to petroleum prices, which fluctuate—
sometimes dramatically—depending on the situation at
the time.
While consumers prefer low prices that allow them to
save money or get more for the same price, producers
naturally prefer to keep prices high. Some oil-producing
countries formed the OPEC cartel in 1960. A cartel is a
group of businesses that agree to control production and
marketing to avoid competing with one another. Since
1973 OPEC has tried to control the oil supply to achieve
higher prices.
OPEC has faced long-term problems, however,
because high prices in the late 1970s to mid-1980s
encouraged conservation, reducing demand for oil and
leading to a sharp decline in oil prices. As a result of
the decreased demand for oil and lower prices, OPEC

lost some of its ability to control its members and,
consequently, prices.
Nevertheless, OPEC actions can still effectively
influence the petroleum market. For example, in an
attempt to halt the downward slide of oil prices in
1999, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Venezuela agreed to
cut production by 1.6% to two million barrels per day.
Many other oil-producing nations also limited their
production. The limitations worked: During the summer
of 2000 oil prices climbed. According to Annual Energy
Review
2000
(Energy
Information
Administration,
2001), refiners paid $16.71 in real dollars per barrel
of crude oil in 1999. In 2000 the price had risen to
$26.40 per barrel.
Gasoline Prices
Many
middle-aged
and
older
Americans
can
remember when gas cost thirty cents per gallon. From
1972 to 1980, the price of a gallon of leaded regular
gasoline (in current dollars that do not consider infla-
tion) more than tripled, while the price in real dollars
(adjusted for inflation) rose 83%. (See Table 2.5.) In
1981 the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline
was $2.33 in real dollars. However, after 1981, as a
result of the international oil glut, real prices tumbled.
In 1998 the price per gallon was only $1.10, and after
price increases in 1999, the price of unleaded gas still
averaged only $1.51 in 2000 and less in 2001 through
2003. By 2004, however, gasoline prices had risen to
$1.74 per gallon.
By the end of April 2006, prices at the pump had
soared in the United States. In many major cities, prices
hovered around $3 per gallon for regular gasoline. Oil
prices were rising all over the world in response to high
demand, especially in the United States, China, Japan,
and India. In addition, the U.S. government was changing
the additives required in certain fuel blends, which
caused shortages in parts of the country, pushing fuel
prices up even more.
To confront the high gasoline prices, President Bush
announced a four-part plan on April 25, 2006. The plan
included:
1. Investigating whether the price of gas had been
unfairly manipulated since Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita hit the Gulf Coast in the summer 2005
2. Promoting greater fuel efficiency by providing tax
credits for all hybrid and ‘‘clean diesel’’ vehicles
sold in 2006
3. Boosting supplies of crude oil and gas by temporarily
halting deposits to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
4. Calling on Congress to support the Advanced
Energy Initiative (see Chapter 1)
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT
OIL TRANSPORTATION
Transporting oil carries significant environmental risks.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, oil tanker
accidents are the cause of most transportation spills.
The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill
While a number of events have influenced American
attitudes toward oil production and use, one of the most
notable occurred in March 1989, when the Exxon Valdez,
an oil tanker, hit a reef in Alaska and spilled eleven
million gallons of crude oil into the waters of Prince

William Sound. The cleanup cost Exxon $1.28 billion, a
sum that does not include legal costs or any valuation for
the wildlife lost. The spill was an environmental disaster
for a formerly pristine area. Even measures used to clean
up the spill, such as washing the beaches with hot water,
caused additional damage.
The Exxon Valdez spill led to debate in the United
States about tanker safety and design. Tankers are bigger
than ever before. In 1945 the largest tanker held 16,500
tons of oil; today supertankers carry more than 550,000
tons. These ships are difficult to maneuver because of
their size and are likely to spill more oil if damaged.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990
The Exxon Valdez oil spill led Congress to pass the
Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (PL 101-380), which increased,
but still limited, oil spillers’ federal liability (financial
responsibility) as long as spills were not the result of
‘‘gross negligence.’’ The bill also mandated compensa-
tion to those who were economically injured by oil spills.
Damages that can be charged to oil companies were
limited to $60 million for tanker accidents and $75 mil-
lion for accidents at offshore facilities. The law specified
that the rest of the cleanup costs were to be paid from a
$500 million oil-spill fund generated by a $0.013-per-
barrel tax on oil. Individual states still have the right to
impose unlimited liability on spillers. Oil companies
were also required to phase in double-hulled vessels by
2015. Essentially, a double-hulled vessel carries its oil in
a container inside another container, providing extra pro-
tection in case of an accident.
Oil Spills Still Occur Worldwide
In November 2002 the twenty-six-year-old, single-
hulled tanker Prestige was damaged off the coast of Spain
and spilled approximately 5,000 tons of heavy fuel oil,
according to Spanish government estimates. The ship
continued to leak, so Spanish authorities ordered the leak-
ing vessel towed to the open ocean. Several thousand
more tons of oil were released as it sank, although much
of the oil may have solidified inside the ship in the cold
water at the bottom of the ocean. Scientists have estimated
that the oil spilled from the Prestige caused the deaths of
nearly 250,000 seabirds. It also killed unknown numbers
of fish and dolphins and was responsible for economic
damage to the Spanish fish and shellfish industries.
Smaller oil spills occur as well. For example, oil
frequently washes ashore on Newfoundland’s south
coast. The oil often comes from bilge water—waste water
contaminated with oil that accumulates in the bottoms of
ships. Bilge water should be properly dumped, but it is
often pumped into the ocean to save dumping costs.
Not All Oil Spills Are Due to Oil Transportation
Hurricane Katrina, which hit the coast of Louisiana
and Mississippi in 2005, triggered 575 spills of petroleum
and hazardous chemicals (generally refinery products),
according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The Gulf Coast is home to many oil refineries with scores
of oil storage tanks and miles of oil pipeline. Some tanks
and pipelines did not withstand the floodwater, releasing
an estimated eight million gallons of oil and refinery
products into the soil and buildings of New Orleans.
Before people can safely move back into these areas,
the oil and other refinery products must be cleaned up
because these chemicals can be hazardous: Short-term
exposure to certain chemicals in the oil causes dizziness
and nausea; long-term exposure has been linked to leu-
kemia and other serious ailments.

CHAPTER 3
NATURAL GAS
Natural gas is an important source of energy in the
United States. Like petroleum, natural gas is composed of
hydrocarbons, which are chemical compounds containing
both hydrogen and carbon. The molecular structure of
hydrocarbon
compounds
varies
from
the
simplest,
methane (CH4), to very heavy and very complex mole-
cules, such as those found in petroleum.
Methane, ethane, and propane are the primary con-
stituents of natural gas, with methane making up 73% to
95% of the total. Consumer-grade natural gas is ‘‘dry
gas,’’ which means that it has been processed to remove
water vapor, nonhydrocarbon gases (such as helium and
nitrogen), and certain compounds that liquefy during the
processing (such as lease condensate and natural gas
plant liquids). Lease condensate is a liquid mix of heavy
hydrocarbons recovered during natural gas processing at
a lease, or field separation, facility. Natural gas plant
liquids are compounds such as propane and butane recov-
ered as liquids at other facilities later in the processing.
The natural gas industry developed out of the petro-
leum industry. Wells drilled for oil often produced con-
siderable amounts of natural gas, but early oilmen had no
idea what to do with it. Originally considered a waste by-
product, natural gas had no market. Even if a use for
natural gas had been known at the time, there were no
transmission lines to deliver it. As a result, the gas was
flared, or burned off. Pictures of southeast Texas in the
early twentieth century show thousands of wooden dril-
ling rigs, each topped with a plume of flaming gas. Even
today, flaring sites are sometimes the brightest spots in
nighttime satellite images, outshining even the largest
urban areas.
Eventually, researchers found ways to use natural gas
for lighting, cooking, and heat. In 1925 the first natural
gas pipeline, more than 200 miles long, was built from
Louisiana to Texas. U.S. demand grew rapidly, especially
after World War II. By the 1950s natural gas was provid-
ing one-quarter of the nation’s energy needs. At the
beginning of this century natural gas was second only
to coal in the share of U.S. energy produced. Crude oil
was third. (See Table 1.1 in Chapter 1.) A vast pipeline
transmission system now connects production facilities in
the United States, Canada, and Mexico with natural gas
distributors. Figure 3.1 shows the production and con-
sumption figures for natural gas for 2004. Figure 3.2
shows the pattern of natural gas supply and distribution
in the United States in 2004.
THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS
Natural gas is produced from gas and oil wells. There
is little delay between production and consumption,
except for gas that is placed in storage. Changes in
demand are almost immediately reflected by changes in
wellhead flows, or supply.
Total U.S. natural gas production in 2004 was 18.8
trillion cubic feet (see Figure 3.3), well below the peak
levels of more than 21 trillion cubic feet produced from
1970 through 1973. According to the Annual Energy
Review
2004
(Energy
Information
Administration,
2005), Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma accounted for
36% of the natural gas produced in the United States in
2004. Although production is increasing because of
demand and rising prices, it continues to be outpaced
by consumption. Imported gas makes up the difference
between supply and demand.
Natural Gas Wells
In 2004 about 385,000 gas wells were in operation in
the United States. (See Figure 3.4.) Although the number
of producing wells increased steadily after 1960 and
more sharply after the mid-1970s, the number of gas
wells in operation fluctuates from year to year because
new wells are opened and old wells are closed. Weather
and economic conditions also affect well operations.
Energy
35

The average productivity of natural gas wells peaked
in 1971, then dropped throughout most of the 1970s and
the mid-1980s; it has remained at a relatively steady low
level since then. (See Figure 3.5.)
Offshore Production
Offshore wells—most are in the Gulf of Mexico
and off the coast of California—accounted for nearly
4.7 trillion of the estimated 23.9 trillion cubic feet of
gross withdrawals of natural gas in 2004, or nearly one-
fifth of the total U.S. production. (See Figure 3.6.)
Offshore production is expected to increase to meet
the nation’s growing need for energy. The U.S. Depart-
ment of the Interior has leased more than 1.5 billion
acres of offshore areas to oil companies for offshore
drilling.
Offshore drilling generally occurs on the outer con-
tinental shelf, in waters up to 200 meters deep (about 650
feet). Figure 3.7 is a diagram of a continental margin. The
continental shelf varies from one coastal area to another:
the shelf is relatively narrow along the Pacific coast, wide
along much of the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Alaska,
and widest in the Gulf of Mexico.
The development of offshore oil and gas resources
began with the drilling of the Summerland oil field along
the coast of California in 1896, where about 400 wells
were drilled. Since then the industry has continually
improved drilling technology. Today, deepwater petro-
leum and natural gas exploration occurs from platforms
and drill ships, while shallow-water explorations occur
from gravel islands and mobile units.
Even though most natural gas is transported by pipe-
lines, rather than tanker ships, accidents such as the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and the Prestige oil spill
off the coast of Spain in 2002 have focused attention on
all types of offshore drilling and tanker transport. Even
before the Exxon Valdez oil spill, environmentalists were
calling for the curtailment of offshore drilling for both oil
and gas. The spills from refining and storage facilities
triggered by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 raised additional
concerns. (See Chapter 2.)
Natural Gas Reserves
Reserves are estimated volumes of gas in known
deposits that are believed to be recoverable in the future.
Proved reserves are those gas volumes that geological

and engineering data show with reasonable certainty to
be recoverable. Proved reserves of natural gas amounted
to 197.1 trillion cubic feet in 2003. (See Table 3.1.)
Natural gas reserves in North America are generally
more abundant than crude oil reserves, although historically
they have been difficult to assess with any accuracy. At
one time the U.S. Department of Energy estimated that
proven supplies of recoverable gas in the United States
would last fewer than eight years. However, with new
discoveries and technological improvements, it now esti-
mates that recoverable supplies will last approximately
twelve years; that is, it would take twelve years to deplete
the proven reserves if current production rates are main-
tained and no new reserves are found (http://www.eia.
doe.gov/emeu/perfpro/fig15.htm).
The North Slope fields of Alaska are estimated to
contain reserves amounting to 35 trillion cubic feet.
However, in early 2006 there was still no easy way to
transport those reserves to the lower forty-eight states.
A pipeline has been proposed but as of 2006 was not
being pursued. If built, it could deliver an estimated 4.5
billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to the lower
forty-eight states, or 5% of the nation’s future daily
natural
gas
consumption
(http://www.ferc.gov/legal/
staff-reports/angta-second.pdf).
Underground Storage
Because of seasonal, daily, and even hourly changes
in demand, substantial natural gas storage facilities have
been created. Many are depleted gas reservoirs located
near transmission lines and marketing areas. Gas is
injected into storage when market needs are lower than
the available gas flow, and gas is withdrawn from storage
when supplies from producing fields and the capacity of
transmission lines are not adequate to meet peak
demands. At the end of 2004 gas in underground storage
totaled approximately 6.9 trillion cubic feet, according to
the U.S. Department of Energy. (See Figure 3.8.)

TRANSMISSION OF NATURAL GAS
A vast network of natural gas pipelines crisscrosses
the United States. The natural gas in this quarter-million-
mile system generally flows northeastward, primarily
from Texas and Louisiana, the two major gas-producing
states, and from Oklahoma and New Mexico. (See Figure
3.9.) It also flows west to California.
Imports of natural gas enter the United States via
pipeline from Canada into Idaho, Maine, Michigan,
Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota,
Washington, and Vermont. Natural gas also enters via
pipeline into Texas from Mexico. According to the
Natural Gas Annual 2004 (Energy Information Admin-
istration, 2005), 85% of imported natural gas arrived
in the United States by pipeline in 2004. The remain-
der was shipped as liquefied natural gas, arriving by
tanker from Algeria, Australia, Malaysia, Nigeria,
Oman, Qatar, and Trinidad. Liquefied natural gas is
produced by cooling natural gas to 260 Fahrenheit;
at this temperature natural gas changes from a gas to a
liquid.

DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS CONSUMPTION
Natural gas fulfills an important part of the country’s
energy needs. It is an attractive fuel not only because its
price is relatively low but also because it burns cleanly
and efficiently, which helps the country meet its environ-
mental goals.
Nationally, natural gas consumption rose from 1949
through 1972, then generally declined through 1986.
Since 1986 natural gas consumption has been rising,
hitting an all-time high of 23.3 trillion cubic feet in
2000, and then declining to 22.3 trillion cubic feet by
2004. (See Table 3.2.) In 2004, 0.7 trillion cubic feet
(about 3% of the natural gas supply) was used to trans-
port the gas through pipelines; 8.4 trillion cubic feet
(38%) was used by industry; 5.4 trillion cubic feet
(24%) by electric utilities; 3 trillion cubic feet (13%) by
commercial customers; and 4.9 trillion cubic feet (22%)
by residences. (See Figure 3.1 and Table 3.2.)
Residential energy consumption depends heavily on
weather-related heating demands. According to the U.S.
Census Bureau in Statistical Abstract of the United
States: 2006, about 57% of all residential energy consu-
mers in the United States used gas to heat their homes in
2003
(http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/
06s0961.xls). Residential consumption is also affected
by conservation practices and the efficiency of gas appli-
ances such as water heaters and stoves. The Natural Gas
Annual 2004 lists California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey as the largest residential
users by volume.
In 2004 the commercial sector used 3 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas. (See Table 3.2.) Its use, like residen-
tial consumption, depends heavily on seasonal require-
ments, as well as the number of users and conservation
measures they have taken.
The industrial sector has historically been the largest
consumer of natural gas. Consumption in this sector in
2004 was 8.4 trillion cubic feet, up slightly from 8.3
trillion cubic feet in 2003, but below the high of 10.2
trillion cubic feet used in 1973. (See Table 3.2.) After
1973, natural gas consumption in the industrial sector
declined quite steadily through 1986, increased through
1997, and then generally declined through 2004. Indus-
trial use grew from 1986 through 1997 because natural
gas was substituted for petroleum for some purposes.
NATURAL GAS PRICES
Natural gas prices can vary across the nation because
federal and state rate structures differ. Region also plays
a role. For example, prices are lower in major natural
gas-producing areas where transmission costs are lower.
From the mid-twentieth century through the early 1970s
natural gas prices were relatively stable as reported in
Annual Energy Review 2004. (See Figure 3.10.) Then

Natural Gas
Energy

governmental deregulation of the industry, as well as
restructuring of companies, brought about a period of
sharply rising prices, with wellhead prices (the value of
natural gas at the mouth of the well) reaching a high in
1983, generally declining through 1995, and then gener-
ally increasing through 2004. The average price of nat-
ural gas at the wellhead was $5.07 in real dollars (that is,
adjusted for inflation) per 1,000 cubic feet in 2004,
sharply up from $2.83 in 2002.
At the retail price level (in real dollars), residential
customers paid $9.92 per thousand cubic feet of natural
gas in 2004, compared with $7.58 in 2002. (See Table
3.3.) Commercial consumers paid $8.56 per thousand
cubic feet in 2004, while industrial consumers paid
$5.91 per thousand cubic feet that year.
Much of the variation in natural gas prices through
the years can be attributed to changes in the natural gas
industry. The passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act of
1978 (PL 95-621) allowed prices at the wellhead to rise
sharply. (See Figure 3.10.) On January 1, 1985, prices for
new gas were deregulated, and additional volumes of
onshore production were deregulated on July 1, 1987.
In 1988 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation
removing all remaining wellhead price controls by 1993.
The 1978 law not only allowed prices to go up; it also
opened the market to the forces of supply and demand.
Now that prices are deregulated and the industry is no
longer constrained by federal controls, the natural gas
industry has become more sensitive to market signals and
responds more quickly to changes in economic conditions.
NATURAL GAS IMPORTS AND EXPORTS
U.S. natural gas trading was limited to the neighbor-
ing countries of Mexico and Canada until shipment of
natural gas in liquefied form became a feasible alterna-
tive to pipelines. In 1969 the first shipments of liquefied
natural gas were sent from Alaska to Japan, and U.S.
imports of liquefied natural gas from Algeria began the
following year.
In 2004 U.S. net imports of natural gas (total
imports minus total exports) by all routes totaled 3.4
trillion cubic feet, or 15.3% of domestic consumption.
Natural gas imports have been increasing significantly
since 1986. Historically, Canada has been by far the
major supplier of U.S. natural gas imports, accounting
for 85% of the natural gas imported in 2004. (See Figure
3.11.)
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004, the
United States exported 854 billion cubic feet of natural
gas in 2004. Mexico bought the largest amount (397
billion cubic feet), followed by Canada (395 billion cubic
feet) and Japan (62 billion cubic feet).
INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS USAGE
World Production
World production of dry natural gas totaled 95.2
trillion cubic feet in 2003, according to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Energy. (See Table 3.4.) Russia accounted for
21.8 trillion cubic feet, while the United States produced
19 trillion cubic feet.

World Consumption
The Annual Energy Review 2004 shows that the
world consumption of natural gas has increased steadily
over the past several decades, from 52.9 trillion cubic feet
in 1980 to 95.5 trillion cubic feet in 2003. The United
States consumed the largest amount of natural gas in
2003, followed by Russia. (See Figure 3.12.) Combined,
they accounted for 39% of world consumption.
FUTURE TRENDS IN THE GAS INDUSTRY
The Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (Energy Informa-
tion Administration, 2006) predicts that, by 2030, total
U.S. natural gas production will decrease. However, con-
sumption will increase, so imports will increase as well.
Natural gas prices for residential customers are projected
to decline from 2006 through 2016, then increase.
Domestic Production
Total domestic natural gas production, according to
Annual Energy Outlook 2006, is projected to decrease
from 2004 through 2030. Only two sources would pro-
vide increases during this period: (1) unconventional
resources in the lower forty-eight states and (2) Alaska,
if a natural gas pipeline becomes operational in 2015.
Other sources are expected to decline. Figure 3.13 shows
projected figures for these different types of natural gas
production. Unconventional sources are those from which
it is more difficult and less economically sound to extract
natural gas because the technology to reach it has not been
developed fully or is too expensive. Note that the abbrevia-
tion NA in Figure 3.13 stands for nonassociated natural gas,
which is gas that is not found with crude oil. The abbrevia-
tion AD, on the other hand, stands for associated-dissolved
natural gas, which is found in a dissolved state with oil,
much like oxygen dissolved in aquarium water.

Domestic Consumption
The Annual Energy Outlook 2006 projects that con-
sumption of natural gas will increase from 22.4 trillion
cubic feet in 2004 to 26.9 trillion cubic feet in 2030.
Demand for natural gas by industrial consumers is
expected to grow slowly because of high prices from
8.5 trillion cubic feet in 2004 to 10.0 trillion cubic feet
in 2030. High prices will also limit growth in the resi-
dential and commercial sectors (see Figure 3.14), where
natural gas use will grow from a combined 7.9 trillion
cubic feet in 2004 to 9.6 trillion cubic feet in 2030.
Because of its efficiency and low emissions, natural gas
will be used in more electricity-generating plants, which
will replace some of the nation’s aging nuclear electri-
city-generating plants. The Energy Information Adminis-
tration estimates that, to meet growing demand, natural
gas pipeline capacity will have to be expanded, particu-
larly along the corridors that move supplies to the Pacific
Coast and the East. A new pipeline from the North Slope
in Alaska would help meet the predicted demand.
Imports and Exports
Net imports of natural gas are projected to increase to
meet demand from 2004 to 2030. Most of these imports
will come from overseas in the form of liquefied natural
gas. (See Figure 3.15.) A decline in Canada’s non-Arctic
conventional natural gas production will be only partially
offset by its Arctic and unconventional production. Nat-
ural gas exports to Mexico are expected to peak in 2006
(shown as a negative import value in Figure 3.15) and
then decline for a period as Mexico develops its own
natural gas infrastructure. However, exports to Mexico
are expected to increase again fairly steadily beginning in
about 2015.

CHAPTER 4
COAL
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Although it had been a source of energy for centuries,
coal was first used on a large scale during the Industrial
Revolution in England. From the mid-eighteenth to the
mid-nineteenth centuries, the sky was filled with billowing
columns of black smoke. Soot covered the towns and cities,
and workers breathed the thick coal dust swirling around
them. Environmental issues, if they were considered at all,
were far less important than the jobs the factories provided.
Factory owners had little reason or incentive to control the
smoke pouring out of their plants—the environmental and
public health effects of pollution were not as well under-
stood as they are today, so government imposed little, if
any, regulation on manufacturing.
In the United States early colonists used wood to heat
their homes because it was so plentiful. Coal was not as
readily available and far more expensive. Before the Civil
War (1861–65), some industries used coal as a source of
energy, but its use expanded greatly with the building of
railroads across the country. In fact, coal became such a
fundamental part of American industrialization that some
have called this era the Coal Age. As in England, Americans
considered the development of industry a source of national
pride. Photographs and postcards of the time proudly
featured trains and steel mills belching dark smoke into gray
skies.
By the early twentieth century coal had become the
major fuel in the United States, accounting for nearly
90% of the nation’s energy requirements. However, as
oil—which was much cleaner—became a favored fuel
for heating homes and offices, and gasoline powered
the growing number of cars, coal’s dominance declined.
According to the Energy Information Administration, by
1945 coal accounted for approximately 40% of the
energy consumed (Annual Energy Review 2004, 2005).
It fell further out of favor in the 1950s and 1960s until, in
the early 1970s, coal provided as little as 17% of the
nation’s energy. By then it had been overtaken by con-
cerns about pollution, along with the emergence of
nuclear power as a promising energy source.
In 1973, however, the oil embargo by the Organiza-
tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries made many Amer-
icans reconsider. The embargo clearly demonstrated the
nation’s heavy reliance on foreign sources of energy and
the potentially crippling effect that dependence could
have on the U.S. economy. Consequently, the nation
revived its interest in domestic coal as a plentiful and
economical energy source.
In 1977 President Jimmy Carter called for an
increase in domestic coal production by two-thirds—to
about 1 billion tons annually by 1985. He proposed a ten-
year, $10 billion program to spark that production. He
also asked utility companies and other large industries to
convert their operations to coal. In 2004 more coal was
produced in the United States than any other form of
energy: 22.7 quadrillion Btu, or 32% of all energy pro-
duced. (See Table 1.1 and Figure 1.4 in Chapter 1.) Coal
was the third-largest source of energy consumed in the
United States in 2004, after petroleum and natural gas.
(See Figure 1.5 in Chapter 1.)
WHAT IS COAL?
Coal is a black, combustible, mineral solid. It devel-
oped over millions of years as plant matter decomposed
in an airless space under increased temperature and pres-
sure. Coal beds, sometimes called seams, are found in the
earth between beds of sandstone, shale, and limestone
and range in thickness from less than an inch to more
than one hundred feet. Approximately five to ten feet of
ancient plant material were compressed to create each
foot of coal.
Coal is used as a fuel and in the production of coal
gas, water gas, many coal-tar compounds, and coke (the
Energy
51

solid substance left after coal gas and coal tar have been
extracted from coal). When coal is burned, its fossil
energy—sunlight converted and stored by plants over
millions of years—is released. One ton of coal produces
22 million Btu on average, about the same heating value
as 22,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 160 gallons of home
heating oil, or a stack of seasoned firewood measuring
404080.
CLASSIFICATIONS OF COAL
There are four basic types of coal. Classifications, or
‘‘coal ranks,’’ are based on how much carbon, volatile
matter, and heating value are contained in the coal:
• Anthracite, or hard coal, is the highest ranked coal. It
is hard and jet-black, with moisture content of less
than 15%. It contains approximately 22 million to 28
million Btu per ton, with an ignition temperature of
approximately 925 to 970 Fahrenheit. Anthracite,
which is used for generating electricity and for space
heating, is mined mainly in northeastern Pennsylva-
nia. (See Figure 4.1.)
• Bituminous, or soft coal, is the most common. It is
dense and black, with moisture content of less than
20% and an ignition range of 700 to 900 Fahrenheit.
With a heating value of 19 million to 30 million Btu
per ton, bituminous coal is used to generate electri-
city, for space heating, and to produce coke. It is
mined chiefly in the Appalachian and Midwest
regions of the United States. (See Figure 4.1.)
• Subbituminous coal, or black lignite, is dull black in
color and generally contains 20% to 30% moisture.
Used for generating electricity and for space heating,
it contains 16 million to 24 million Btu per ton. Black
lignite is mined primarily in the western United
States. (See Figure 4.1.)
• Lignite, the lowest ranked coal, is brownish-black in
color and has a high moisture content. It tends to
disintegrate when exposed to weather. Lignite con-
tains about 9 million to 17 million Btu per ton and is
used mainly to generate electricity. Most lignite is
mined in North Dakota, Montana, Texas, California,
and Louisiana. (See Figure 4.1.)
In 2004 domestic mines produced more than 1.1
billion short tons of all types of coal. (A short ton of coal
is 2,000 pounds.) About 92% of it was bituminous (546.6
million short tons) and subbituminous coal (479.6 million
short tons). Lignite accounted for much of the remainder.
Very little of the total was anthracite. (See Table 4.1.)
LOCATIONS OF COAL DEPOSITS
Coal is found in about 450,000 square miles, or 13%,
of the total land area of the United States. Figure 4.1
shows the coal-bearing areas of the United States. Geol-
ogists have divided U.S. coalfields into the Appalachian,
Interior, and Western regions. The Appalachian region is
subdivided into three areas: Northern (Maryland, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia); Central (east-
ern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and southern West
Virginia); and Southern Appalachia (Alabama). The
Interior region includes mines in Arkansas, Illinois, Indi-
ana, Iowa, Kansas, western Kentucky, Louisiana, Mis-
souri, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Western region is
divided into the Northern Great Plains (northern Color-
ado, Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming);
the Rocky Mountains; the Southwest (Arizona, southern
Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah); and the Northwest
(Alaska and Washington).
Before 1999 most of the nation’s coal was mined east
of the Mississippi River. Miners had been digging deeper
and deeper into the Appalachian Mountains for years
before the bulldozers cut open the rich seams of eastern
Montana. In 1965, according to the U.S. Department of
Energy in Annual Energy Review 2004, western mines
produced 27.4 million short tons, only 5% of the national
total.
By
1999,
however,
western
production
had
increased more than twentyfold, to 570.8 million short
tons, or 52% of the total. (See Table 4.1.) The amount of
coal mined east of the Mississippi that year was 529.6
million short tons. In 2004 mines west of the Mississippi
produced 627.3 million short tons—56% of the total—
while eastern mines produced 484.1 million short tons.
The growth in coal production in the western states
resulted, in part, because of an increased demand for low-
sulfur coal, which is concentrated there. Low-sulfur coal
burns cleaner and is considered less dangerous to the
environment. In addition, the coal is closer to the surface,
so it can be extracted by surface mining, which is cheaper
and more efficient. Improved rail service has also made it
easier to deliver this low-sulfur coal to electric power
plants located east of the Mississippi River.
COAL-MINING METHODS
The method used to mine coal depends on the terrain
and the depth of the coal. Before the early 1970s most
coal was taken from underground mines. Since then coal
production has shifted to surface mines. (See Table 4.1
and Figure 4.2.)
Underground mining is required when the coal lies
more than two hundred feet below ground. The depth of
most underground mines is less than 1,000 feet, but a few
are 2,000 feet deep. In underground mines some coal
must be left untouched to form pillars that prevent the
mines from caving in.
Figure 4.3 shows three types of underground mines: a
shaft mine, a slope mine, and a drift mine. In a shaft
mine, elevators take miners and equipment up and down
52
Coal
Energy

a vertical shaft to the coal deposit. Entrance to a slope
mine, by contrast, is an incline from the aboveground
opening. In a drift mine, the mineshaft runs horizontally
from the opening in the hillside. As Figure 4.3 shows,
workers and equipment are moved externally up the side
of a hill or mountain to the entry.
Surface mines are usually less than two hundred feet
deep and can be developed in flat or hilly terrain. On
large plots of relatively flat ground workers use a tech-
nique known as area surface mining. Rock and soil that
lie above the coal—called ‘‘overburden’’ or ‘‘spoil’’—are
loosened by drilling and blasting and then dug away.
Another technique, contour surface mining, follows coal
deposits along hillsides. (See Figure 4.3.) Open pit
mining—a combination of area and contour mining—is
used to mine thick, steeply inclined coal deposits.
Growth of surface mining and the closure of nonpro-
ductive mines led to increases in coal-mining productivity

through the 1980s and 1990s. (See Figure 4.4.) Because
surface mines are easier to work, they average up to three
times the productivity of underground mines. According
to the Annual Energy Review 2004, the productivity for
surface mines was 10.5 short tons of coal per miner hour
in 2004, while productivity for underground mines was 4
short tons per miner hour. In 2000 the combined average
productivity for both mining methods reached an all-time
high of 7 short tons per miner hour. In 2004 combined
average productivity was 6.8 short tons per miner hour.
COAL-MINING SAFETY AND HEALTH RISKS
Mining safety in the United States is overseen by the
Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA), which
was formed in 1978 after Congress passed the Federal
Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (PL 91-173; amended
by PL 95-164). The law established mandatory health and
safety standards for mines and required that mine opera-
tors and miners comply with them. It also provided
assistance to the states to develop and enforce effective
state mine health and safety programs and expanded

research and development aimed at preventing accidents
and diseases associated with mining occupations.
Throughout its history coal mining has been a physi-
cally challenging and dangerous occupation, with a
recognized risk for injury or disease. As early as 1822
the term ‘‘miner’s asthma’’ was used to describe the
breathing difficulties and coughing often experienced by
mine
workers
(http://www.umwa.org/blacklung/black
lung.-shtml). In addition, mine accidents can occur with-
out warning, including cave-ins, fires, underground
floods, equipment failures, and gas explosions. (Flam-
mable gases, notably methane, are found naturally in
coal mines.) In underground mines these accidents carry
the additional risk of trapping miners in the mine with-
out air, water, or food.
Fatalities
According to the MSHA, a total of 104,631 people were
killed in coal-mining accidents between 1900 and July 2006
(http://www.msha.gov/stats/centurystats/coalstats.htm).

In records dating back to 1839, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health found that 13,805 fatalities
in the United States had resulted from 614 coal-mine
disasters (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/statistics/discoal.
htm); a ‘‘mine disaster’’ is a mine accident that claims
five or more lives. The number of disasters peaked
during the period 1901 through 1925, when 297 large
accidents occurred. The most deadly event in U.S.
history occurred when explosions in the Monongah
mines in Monongah, West Virginia, claimed 363 lives
in December 1907; 1907 was, in fact, the deadliest year
on record, with 3,242 fatalities. Of the twenty-six U.S.
disasters that caused one hundred or more fatalities,
seventeen of them took place between 1901 and 1925.
With a death toll of 125 and more than 1,100 injured,
the deadliest coal-mining accident in recent decades was
the massive Buffalo Creek flood in southern West Virgi-
nia in February 1972. After several days of heavy rain, a
dam burst that was holding mine wastewater in a series of
hillside pools. More than 132 million gallons of water
then poured out and rushed through the valley below in
the form of a black wave that reached fifteen to twenty
feet high. The power of the water smashed structures and
moved whole houses and railroad cars downstream. Ter-
rified residents ran up nearby hills to get above the water
level. Within minutes several communities located along
a seventeen-mile stretch of Buffalo Creek were deva-
stated, and the town of Saunders was completely
destroyed
(http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/buffcreek/
bctitle.html).
Coal mining has dramatically increased its safety
record since the early and mid-twentieth century. Tighter
regulations, improvements in technology, and preventive
programs are credited with lowering—though not elim-
inating—many of the risks undertaken by miners. From
1981 to 2006 there were eleven coal-mine disasters that
killed five or more people. The worst accident during this
period was a mine fire that claimed twenty-seven lives at
the Wilberg Mine in Orangeville, Utah, in December
1984. The year 2005 saw the fewest fatalities ever in
the coal-mining industry: twenty-two.
Nonetheless, mine disasters and deaths can still
occur. In January 2006 a mine disaster at the Sago Mine
in Tallmansville, West Virginia, claimed the lives of
twelve miners. One miner survived. The miners were
trapped following an explosion of methane gas that may
have been triggered by a lightning strike; investigators
have theorized that a buildup of gas over the holidays
might have contributed to the disaster, as the blast
occurred shortly after the first shift returned to work on
January 2. The explosion disabled the mine’s internal
communication system, which interfered with rescue
operations. Rescue was also delayed because the air in
the
mine
contained
high
concentrations
of
carbon
monoxide and methane, which made it unsafe for rescue
workers. Of those who perished, one was believed to
have been killed by the initial blast, and the others suc-
cumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning. Sago was the
worst mining disaster in the United States since thirteen
miners were killed in 2001 in a mine in Brookwood,
Alabama, and the worst in West Virginia since seventy-
eight were killed at the Consol No. 9 mine in Farmington
in 1968.
Long-Term Health Risks
In addition to the risk of injury or death, coal
miners face a wide range of long-term health concerns,
including muscle and joint conditions, hearing loss
brought on by excessive noise, and respiratory ill-
nesses associated with dust, fumes, and chemical expo-
sure. One serious illness associated with mining is coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis, known as black lung dis-
ease, which results from repeated inhalation of coal
dust. This risk has been drastically reduced, however,
through the use of dust masks and respirators; by
covering the walls of mine tunnels and shafts with
pulverized white rock to lower the level of the dust;
and by spraying water to settle the dust. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in
1993, 1,631 people died as a result of black lung
disease; by 2002 (the latest year for which figures
have been released) the number had been reduced to 858
(http://www2a.cdc.gov/drds/WorldReportData/FigureTable
Details.asp?FigureTableID¼24).
COAL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET
Overall Production and Consumption
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004, the
nation consumed 558.4 million short tons of coal in 1974.
Thirty years later, in 2004, consumption had grown to
slightly more than 1.1 billion short tons—nearly twice as
much. (Figure 4.5 shows the flow of coal in 2004.) Most
increases in consumption were in the electric power
sector, as existing power plants were switched to coal
from more expensive oil and natural gas and many new
coal-fired power plants were constructed. Consumption
of coal in the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors decreased from 1949 to 2004.
Coal Consumption by Sector
In the electric power sector, coal is pulverized and
burned to heat boilers that produce steam, which drives
generators that create electricity. Each ton of coal used to
drive a generator produces about 2,000 kilowatt-hours of
electricity. In household terms, each pound of coal pro-
duces enough electricity to light ten 100-watt light bulbs
for one hour.

Energy

solid substance left after coal gas and coal tar have been
extracted from coal). When coal is burned, its fossil
energy—sunlight converted and stored by plants over
millions of years—is released. One ton of coal produces
22 million Btu on average, about the same heating value
as 22,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 160 gallons of home
heating oil, or a stack of seasoned firewood measuring
404080.
CLASSIFICATIONS OF COAL
There are four basic types of coal. Classifications, or
‘‘coal ranks,’’ are based on how much carbon, volatile
matter, and heating value are contained in the coal:
• Anthracite, or hard coal, is the highest ranked coal. It
is hard and jet-black, with moisture content of less
than 15%. It contains approximately 22 million to 28
million Btu per ton, with an ignition temperature of
approximately 925 to 970 Fahrenheit. Anthracite,
which is used for generating electricity and for space
heating, is mined mainly in northeastern Pennsylva-
nia. (See Figure 4.1.)
• Bituminous, or soft coal, is the most common. It is
dense and black, with moisture content of less than
20% and an ignition range of 700 to 900 Fahrenheit.
With a heating value of 19 million to 30 million Btu
per ton, bituminous coal is used to generate electri-
city, for space heating, and to produce coke. It is
mined chiefly in the Appalachian and Midwest
regions of the United States. (See Figure 4.1.)
• Subbituminous coal, or black lignite, is dull black in
color and generally contains 20% to 30% moisture.
Used for generating electricity and for space heating,
it contains 16 million to 24 million Btu per ton. Black
lignite is mined primarily in the western United
States. (See Figure 4.1.)
• Lignite, the lowest ranked coal, is brownish-black in
color and has a high moisture content. It tends to
disintegrate when exposed to weather. Lignite con-
tains about 9 million to 17 million Btu per ton and is
used mainly to generate electricity. Most lignite is
mined in North Dakota, Montana, Texas, California,
and Louisiana. (See Figure 4.1.)
In 2004 domestic mines produced more than 1.1
billion short tons of all types of coal. (A short ton of coal
is 2,000 pounds.) About 92% of it was bituminous (546.6
million short tons) and subbituminous coal (479.6 million
short tons). Lignite accounted for much of the remainder.
Very little of the total was anthracite. (See Table 4.1.)
LOCATIONS OF COAL DEPOSITS
Coal is found in about 450,000 square miles, or 13%,
of the total land area of the United States. Figure 4.1
shows the coal-bearing areas of the United States. Geol-
ogists have divided U.S. coalfields into the Appalachian,
Interior, and Western regions. The Appalachian region is
subdivided into three areas: Northern (Maryland, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia); Central (east-
ern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and southern West
Virginia); and Southern Appalachia (Alabama). The
Interior region includes mines in Arkansas, Illinois, Indi-
ana, Iowa, Kansas, western Kentucky, Louisiana, Mis-
souri, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Western region is
divided into the Northern Great Plains (northern Color-
ado, Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming);
the Rocky Mountains; the Southwest (Arizona, southern
Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah); and the Northwest
(Alaska and Washington).
Before 1999 most of the nation’s coal was mined east
of the Mississippi River. Miners had been digging deeper
and deeper into the Appalachian Mountains for years
before the bulldozers cut open the rich seams of eastern
Montana. In 1965, according to the U.S. Department of
Energy in Annual Energy Review 2004, western mines
produced 27.4 million short tons, only 5% of the national
total.
By
1999,
however,
western
production
had
increased more than twentyfold, to 570.8 million short
tons, or 52% of the total. (See Table 4.1.) The amount of
coal mined east of the Mississippi that year was 529.6
million short tons. In 2004 mines west of the Mississippi
produced 627.3 million short tons—56% of the total—
while eastern mines produced 484.1 million short tons.
The growth in coal production in the western states
resulted, in part, because of an increased demand for low-
sulfur coal, which is concentrated there. Low-sulfur coal
burns cleaner and is considered less dangerous to the
environment. In addition, the coal is closer to the surface,
so it can be extracted by surface mining, which is cheaper
and more efficient. Improved rail service has also made it
easier to deliver this low-sulfur coal to electric power
plants located east of the Mississippi River.
COAL-MINING METHODS
The method used to mine coal depends on the terrain
and the depth of the coal. Before the early 1970s most
coal was taken from underground mines. Since then coal
production has shifted to surface mines. (See Table 4.1
and Figure 4.2.)
Underground mining is required when the coal lies
more than two hundred feet below ground. The depth of
most underground mines is less than 1,000 feet, but a few
are 2,000 feet deep. In underground mines some coal
must be left untouched to form pillars that prevent the
mines from caving in.
Figure 4.3 shows three types of underground mines: a
shaft mine, a slope mine, and a drift mine. In a shaft
mine, elevators take miners and equipment up and down
52

Energy

a vertical shaft to the coal deposit. Entrance to a slope
mine, by contrast, is an incline from the aboveground
opening. In a drift mine, the mineshaft runs horizontally
from the opening in the hillside. As Figure 4.3 shows,
workers and equipment are moved externally up the side
of a hill or mountain to the entry.
Surface mines are usually less than two hundred feet
deep and can be developed in flat or hilly terrain. On
large plots of relatively flat ground workers use a tech-
nique known as area surface mining. Rock and soil that
lie above the coal—called ‘‘overburden’’ or ‘‘spoil’’—are
loosened by drilling and blasting and then dug away.
Another technique, contour surface mining, follows coal
deposits along hillsides. (See Figure 4.3.) Open pit
mining—a combination of area and contour mining—is
used to mine thick, steeply inclined coal deposits.
Growth of surface mining and the closure of nonpro-
ductive mines led to increases in coal-mining productivity

through the 1980s and 1990s. (See Figure 4.4.) Because
surface mines are easier to work, they average up to three
times the productivity of underground mines. According
to the Annual Energy Review 2004, the productivity for
surface mines was 10.5 short tons of coal per miner hour
in 2004, while productivity for underground mines was 4
short tons per miner hour. In 2000 the combined average
productivity for both mining methods reached an all-time
high of 7 short tons per miner hour. In 2004 combined
average productivity was 6.8 short tons per miner hour.
COAL-MINING SAFETY AND HEALTH RISKS
Mining safety in the United States is overseen by the
Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA), which
was formed in 1978 after Congress passed the Federal
Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (PL 91-173; amended
by PL 95-164). The law established mandatory health and
safety standards for mines and required that mine opera-
tors and miners comply with them. It also provided
assistance to the states to develop and enforce effective
state mine health and safety programs and expanded

research and development aimed at preventing accidents
and diseases associated with mining occupations.
Throughout its history coal mining has been a physi-
cally challenging and dangerous occupation, with a
recognized risk for injury or disease. As early as 1822
the term ‘‘miner’s asthma’’ was used to describe the
breathing difficulties and coughing often experienced by
mine
workers
(http://www.umwa.org/blacklung/black
lung.-shtml). In addition, mine accidents can occur with-
out warning, including cave-ins, fires, underground
floods, equipment failures, and gas explosions. (Flam-
mable gases, notably methane, are found naturally in
coal mines.) In underground mines these accidents carry
the additional risk of trapping miners in the mine with-
out air, water, or food.
Fatalities
According to the MSHA, a total of 104,631 people were
killed in coal-mining accidents between 1900 and July 2006
(http://www.msha.gov/stats/centurystats/coalstats.htm).

In records dating back to 1839, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health found that 13,805 fatalities
in the United States had resulted from 614 coal-mine
disasters (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/statistics/discoal.
htm); a ‘‘mine disaster’’ is a mine accident that claims
five or more lives. The number of disasters peaked
during the period 1901 through 1925, when 297 large
accidents occurred. The most deadly event in U.S.
history occurred when explosions in the Monongah
mines in Monongah, West Virginia, claimed 363 lives
in December 1907; 1907 was, in fact, the deadliest year
on record, with 3,242 fatalities. Of the twenty-six U.S.
disasters that caused one hundred or more fatalities,
seventeen of them took place between 1901 and 1925.
With a death toll of 125 and more than 1,100 injured,
the deadliest coal-mining accident in recent decades was
the massive Buffalo Creek flood in southern West Virgi-
nia in February 1972. After several days of heavy rain, a
dam burst that was holding mine wastewater in a series of
hillside pools. More than 132 million gallons of water
then poured out and rushed through the valley below in
the form of a black wave that reached fifteen to twenty
feet high. The power of the water smashed structures and
moved whole houses and railroad cars downstream. Ter-
rified residents ran up nearby hills to get above the water
level. Within minutes several communities located along
a seventeen-mile stretch of Buffalo Creek were deva-
stated, and the town of Saunders was completely
destroyed
(http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/buffcreek/
bctitle.html).
Coal mining has dramatically increased its safety
record since the early and mid-twentieth century. Tighter
regulations, improvements in technology, and preventive
programs are credited with lowering—though not elim-
inating—many of the risks undertaken by miners. From
1981 to 2006 there were eleven coal-mine disasters that
killed five or more people. The worst accident during this
period was a mine fire that claimed twenty-seven lives at
the Wilberg Mine in Orangeville, Utah, in December
1984. The year 2005 saw the fewest fatalities ever in
the coal-mining industry: twenty-two.
Nonetheless, mine disasters and deaths can still
occur. In January 2006 a mine disaster at the Sago Mine
in Tallmansville, West Virginia, claimed the lives of
twelve miners. One miner survived. The miners were
trapped following an explosion of methane gas that may
have been triggered by a lightning strike; investigators
have theorized that a buildup of gas over the holidays
might have contributed to the disaster, as the blast
occurred shortly after the first shift returned to work on
January 2. The explosion disabled the mine’s internal
communication system, which interfered with rescue
operations. Rescue was also delayed because the air in
the
mine
contained
high
concentrations
of
carbon
monoxide and methane, which made it unsafe for rescue
workers. Of those who perished, one was believed to
have been killed by the initial blast, and the others suc-
cumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning. Sago was the
worst mining disaster in the United States since thirteen
miners were killed in 2001 in a mine in Brookwood,
Alabama, and the worst in West Virginia since seventy-
eight were killed at the Consol No. 9 mine in Farmington
in 1968.
Long-Term Health Risks
In addition to the risk of injury or death, coal
miners face a wide range of long-term health concerns,
including muscle and joint conditions, hearing loss
brought on by excessive noise, and respiratory ill-
nesses associated with dust, fumes, and chemical expo-
sure. One serious illness associated with mining is coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis, known as black lung dis-
ease, which results from repeated inhalation of coal
dust. This risk has been drastically reduced, however,
through the use of dust masks and respirators; by
covering the walls of mine tunnels and shafts with
pulverized white rock to lower the level of the dust;
and by spraying water to settle the dust. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in
1993, 1,631 people died as a result of black lung
disease; by 2002 (the latest year for which figures
have been released) the number had been reduced to 858
(http://www2a.cdc.gov/drds/WorldReportData/FigureTable
Details.asp?FigureTableID¼24).
COAL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET
Overall Production and Consumption
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004, the
nation consumed 558.4 million short tons of coal in 1974.
Thirty years later, in 2004, consumption had grown to
slightly more than 1.1 billion short tons—nearly twice as
much. (Figure 4.5 shows the flow of coal in 2004.) Most
increases in consumption were in the electric power
sector, as existing power plants were switched to coal
from more expensive oil and natural gas and many new
coal-fired power plants were constructed. Consumption
of coal in the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors decreased from 1949 to 2004.
Coal Consumption by Sector
In the electric power sector, coal is pulverized and
burned to heat boilers that produce steam, which drives
generators that create electricity. Each ton of coal used to
drive a generator produces about 2,000 kilowatt-hours of
electricity. In household terms, each pound of coal pro-
duces enough electricity to light ten 100-watt light bulbs
for one hour.

Coal
Energy

Electric power companies are by far the largest con-
sumers of coal today. (See Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6.)
They accounted for 92% of domestic coal consumption,
or slightly more than 1 billion short tons, in 2004.
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004, coal-fired
plants produced 2 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity, or
50% of U.S. electricity net generation, in 2004. (Net
generation refers to the power available to the system—
it does not include power used at the generating plant, but
it does include power that may be lost during transmis-
sion and distribution.)
The industrial sector was the second-largest consu-
mer of coal in 2004, accounting for 8% of coal use (see
Figure 4.6), or 84.9 million short tons (see Figure 4.5).
Coal is used in many industrial applications, including
the chemical, cement, paper, synthetic fuels, metals, and
food-processing industries.
Coal was once a significant fuel source in the resi-
dential and commercial sectors. (See Figure 4.6.) In 1949
these sectors used 116.5 million short tons of coal. After
the 1940s, however, coal was replaced by oil, natural gas,
and electricity, which are cleaner and more convenient.
By 1970, notes the Annual Energy Review 2004, only
16.1 million short tons of coal were used in the residen-
tial and commercial sectors. Since then residential and
commercial coal use has continued to decline, falling to
4.3 million short tons in 2004, or far less than 1% of total
coal use.
The Price of Coal
In 2004 the average price of a short ton of coal had
fallen to $18.34 in real dollars—that is, adjusted for
inflation—slightly higher than the all-time low of
$16.78 in 2000 and only 36% of the 1975 price. (See
Table 4.2.) On a per-Btu basis, coal remains the least
expensive fossil fuel. In 2001 the average cost of coal
was $1.29 per million Btu, compared with $6.87 per
million Btu for natural gas and $3.99 per million Btu
for residential fuel oil, according to the Annual Energy
Review 2004.
COAL AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Problems
In 1306 King Edward I of England so objected to the
noxious smoke from London’s coal-burning fires that he
banned the use of coal by everyone except blacksmiths.
Since then, the potential for pollution has multiplied

exponentially, given the amount of fossil fuels, such as
coal, that are burned worldwide.
THE
‘‘GREENHOUSE
EFFECT.’’ Coal-fired electric
power plants emit gases that are considered harmful to
the environment. Scientists believe that burning huge
quantities of fossil fuels causes a ‘‘greenhouse effect,’’
in which gases released from the fuels trap heat in Earth’s
atmosphere, raising temperatures. According to the
Energy Information Administration, Earth has warmed
about 1 Fahrenheit in the past 100 years. Some of the
effects of the added heat are immediate, while others
happen over long periods of time.
Much of the gas that causes the greenhouse effect is
carbon dioxide. In 2003 the combustion of coal in the
United States produced 2.1 billion metric tons of carbon
dioxide, or 36% of total carbon dioxide emissions from
all fossil fuels used in the United States. (See Figure
4.7.)
ACID RAIN. Acid rain is any form of precipitation that
contains a greater-than-normal amount of acid. In many
parts of the world it has caused significant damage to
forests and lakes.
Even nonpolluted rain is slightly acidic: rainwater
combines with the carbon dioxide normally found in the
air to produce a weak acid called carbonic acid. However,
pollutants in the air can increase the acidity of rain and
other forms of precipitation, such as snow and fog. Che-
micals such as oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, for instance,
which are released during the combustion of fossil fuels,
create highly acidic precipitation. The amount of these
oxides in the air is directly related to the amount and
content of automobile exhaust and industrial and power
plant emissions.
COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES. Emissions from coal-
fired power plants include mercury, sulfur oxides, and
nitrogen oxides. Mercury can reach humans when they
eat fish contaminated by mercury that, after being
emitted into the air, settles in lakes and streams. Mercury
can cause birth defects in newborns exposed to it in the
womb. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides contribute to air
pollution, which is known to cause respiratory impair-
ments. (See Table 4.3.)
Solutions
THE CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY LAW. In 1984 Con-
gress established the Clean Coal Technology program
(PL 98-473), which directed the Department of Energy
to administer projects that would demonstrate that coal
could be used in environmentally and economically effi-
cient ways. The cost of the projects was to be shared by
industry and government.
CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY AND THE CLEAN AIR
ACT. The stated goal of both Congress and the Depart-
ment of Energy has been to develop cost-effective ways
to burn coal more cleanly, both to control acid rain and
air pollution and to reduce the nation’s dependence on
imported fuels. One strategy is a slow, phased-in
approach that allows utility companies and states to
reduce their emissions in stages.
The burning of coal can be made cleaner by using
physical or chemical methods. Scrubbers, a common
physical method used to reduce sulfur dioxide emis-
sions, filter coal emissions by spraying lime or a
calcium compound and water across the emission
stream before it leaves the smokestack. The sulfur
dioxide bonds to the spray and settles as a mudlike
substance that can be pumped out for disposal. How-
ever, scrubbers are expensive to operate, so mechan-
ical and fabric particulate collectors are the most com-
mon emissions cleaners. While they are cheaper to
operate than scrubbers, they are less effective. Some
utilities use cooling towers to reduce the heat in emis-
sions before they are released into the atmosphere and
to reduce some pollutants. Chemical cleaning, a rela-
tively new technology, uses biological or chemical
agents to clean emissions.

gigawatts (1 gigawatt equals 1,000 megawatts). Statis-
tics were collected on three types of environmental
equipment: particulate collectors, cooling towers, and
scrubbers. Some plants had all three types of equip-
ment; some had two, and some had only one. All the
plants had particulate collectors, nearly half had cooling
towers, but less than one-third had scrubbers.
The Clean Air Act of 1990 (PL 101–549) placed
restrictions on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emis-
sions, which first took effect in 1995 and were tightened
in 2000. Each round of regulation requires utilities to find
lower-sulfur coal or to install cleaner technology, such as
scrubbers. The first Clean Air Act, passed in 1970, sought
to change air-quality standards at new generating stations
while exempting existing coal-fired plants. Under the
1990 act, older plants are also bound by the 1970 regula-
tions. In addition, plants with coal-fired boilers must be
built to reduce sulfur emissions by 70% to 90%. When
new plants that burn high-sulfur coal are built, about 30%
of their construction costs are spent on pollution control
equipment. Up to 5% of the plants’ power output is used
to operate this equipment. Research is under way to
develop technology to lower these costs.
When President George W. Bush took office in 2001,
he promised to ease the regulations for older coal-burning
plants to keep them up and running. His energy policy
would have allowed the plants to modify their equipment
and structures without adding pollution control measures,
as long as they met certain conditions. Fifteen state
governments and environmental and public health groups
brought suit to stop this interpretation of the Clean Air
Act. In April 2006 the Bush policy was rejected by the
courts.
THE CLEAN AIR INTERSTATE RULE AND THE CLEAN
AIR MERCURY RULE. In March 2005 the Environmental
Protection Agency announced the Clean Air Interstate
Rule. It focused on twenty-eight eastern states and the
District of Columbia where sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide emissions contributed significantly to fine particle
and ozone pollution in downwind states. Under the

regulations, coal-burning power plants would have to
install advanced pollution-control technologies, use coal
that burned cleaner, or make other changes to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When
fully implemented, the rule is expected to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions by 70% and nitrogen oxide emissions
by 60% from 2003 levels. The agency also announced
the Clean Air Mercury Rule, which made the United
States the first country to regulate mercury emissions
from power plants. Mercury, when ingested by children,
can have serious health consequences. When fully
implemented, the two rules are expected to reduce
mercury emissions from electric power plants by nearly
70% from 1999 levels.
COAL EXPORTS
Since 1950 the United States has produced more coal
than it has consumed, allowing it to become a significant
exporter. However, exports of this energy source have
declined dramatically since 1991, when the U.S. exported
109 million short tons of coal. In 2004 the U.S. exported
48 million short tons. (See Table 4.4.)
In 2004 coal made up 28% of all U.S. energy
exports. (See Figure 1.7 in Chapter 1.) The countries
that bought the most U.S. coal were Canada, Brazil,
Japan, the Netherlands, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
(See Table 4.4.)
INTERNATIONAL COAL PRODUCTION
AND CONSUMPTION
The Annual Energy Review 2004 reported that
slightly more than 5.4 billion short tons of coal were
produced worldwide in 2003, accounting for 24% of
world energy production. China produced the most
coal—more than 1.6 billion short tons—followed by the
United States, which mined almost 1.1 billion short tons.
(See Figure 4.8.) Other major coal producers were India,
Australia, Russia, South Africa, Germany, and Poland.
World consumption of coal in 2003 totaled slightly
more than 5.4 billion short tons. China consumed the most,
using more than 1.5 billion short tons, followed by the
United States, which used slightly less than 1.1 billion short
tons. (See Figure 4.9.) Other major consumers included
India, Germany, Russia, South Africa, and Japan.
FUTURE TRENDS IN THE COAL INDUSTRY
The Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (Energy Informa-
tion Administration, 2006) provides forecasts for domes-
tic coal production. Output is expected to increase to
nearly 1.3 billion short tons by 2015, to more than 1.5
billion short tons by 2025, and to 1.7 billion short tons by
2030. (See Table 4.5.) Domestic coal consumption is
projected to match (2015) and surpass (2025 and 2030)

production, reaching nearly 1.3 billion short tons in 2015,
almost 1.6 billion short tons by 2025, and nearly 1.8
billion short tons by 2030. Electric power generation is
expected to use the majority of the coal produced in 2015
(approximately 1.2 billion short tons), 2025 (nearly 1.4
billion short tons), and 2030 (1.5 billion short tons). The
projections assume the provisions of the Clean Air Act,
the Clean Air Interstate Rule, and the Clean Air Mercury
Rule are being enforced.
Coal minemouth prices—the price of coal at the
mouth of the mine before transportation and other costs
are added—are projected to rise slightly from $20.07 per
short ton in 2004 (see Table 4.5) to $20.39 in 2015, to
$20.63 in 2025, and to $21.73 in 2030. Prices are
expected to go up because of increased demand for coal
from the electric power sector.
The Annual Energy Outlook 2006 also predicts that
U.S. coal exports—about 4% of the coal mined in 2004—
will decline by 2030 to only 1% of coal mined. All
projections expect the United States to become a net
importer of coal over the 2004–2030 period.
All of the projections could be affected by new
environmental legislation—more stringent acid rain
regulations, for example—as well as by conservation
initiatives
and
additional
clean-coal
technologies.
Furthermore, because pollutants travel as winds circle
the globe, the U.S. environment and the domestic coal
industry may be affected by coal use in other coun-
tries. For instance, China, with nearly five times the
population of the United States and a growing econ-
omy, may surpass the United States in carbon emis-
sions by 2020.

CHAPTER 5
NUCLEAR ENERGY
In the early 1970s many Americans favored the use
of nuclear power to generate electricity. Reactors had
been in operation since 1956, providing what appeared
to be cleaner, more efficient energy than power plants
that burned fossil fuels. In addition, the nation had plenty
of uranium, the fuel used in U.S. reactors, so nuclear
plants could help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources.
By the beginning of this century, however, opinion
had turned: Voices were being raised in the United
States—as well as around the world—in opposition to
building additional nuclear power plants. In fact, some
people wanted existing plants shut down. Two inci-
dents—an accident in 1979 at the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, in which the reactor
core lost coolant and partially melted, and the 1986
catastrophe at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, in which
a reactor exploded and released huge amounts of radio-
activity into the atmosphere—greatly increased concerns
about the safety of nuclear power. Reports of design
flaws, cracks, and leaks in other reactors fueled public
fears. Furthermore, the safe disposal of radioactive waste,
which is a by-product of nuclear energy, had become a
scientific and political headache.
Supporters of nuclear power say that it is as safe as
any other form of energy production, as long as it is
monitored properly. They point to the growing problems
related to the use of fossil fuels: global warming, acid
rain, and the damage caused by mining and transporting
fossil fuels. This concern over fossil fuels has led a small
number of environmentalists who had previously opposed
nuclear power to reconsider their position. Nonetheless,
environmental, safety, and economic concerns have
restrained growth in the nuclear industry since the mid-
1970s. Figure 5.1 shows that from 1988 through 2004
nuclear energy’s share of electricity production leveled
off at about 20%.
HOW NUCLEAR ENERGY WORKS
In a nuclear power plant, fuel (uranium in the United
States) in the core of the reactor generates a nuclear
reaction (fission) that produces heat. In a pressurized
water reactor (see Figure 5.2), the heat from the reaction
is carried away by water under high pressure, which heats
a second water stream, producing steam. The steam runs
through a turbine, making the attached generator spin,
which produces electricity. The large cooling towers
associated with nuclear plants cool the steam after it has
run through the turbines. A boiling water reactor works
much the same way, except that the water surrounding
the core boils and directly produces the steam, which is
then piped to the turbine generator.
The challenges faced by those who operate a nuclear
power reactor include finding fuel (uranium 235) that
will sustain a chain reaction; maintaining the reaction at
a level that yields heat but does not escalate out of control
and explode; and coping with the radiation produced by
the chain reaction.
Radioactivity
Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of energy
and/or high-energy particles from the nucleus of an atom.
One type of radioactivity is produced naturally and is
emitted by radioactive isotopes (or radioisotopes), such
as radioactive carbon (carbon 14, or C-14) and radio-
active hydrogen (H-3, or tritium). The energy and high-
energy particles that radioactive isotopes emit include
alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays.
Isotopes are atoms of an element that have the usual
number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in
their nuclei. For example, twelve protons and twelve
neutrons make up the nucleus of the element carbon.
One isotope of carbon, C-14, has twelve protons and
fourteen neutrons in its nucleus.
Energy
65

Radioisotopes (such as C-14) are unstable isotopes,
and their nuclei decay, or break apart, at a steady rate.
Decaying radioisotopes produce other isotopes as they
emit energy and/or high-energy particles. If the newly
formed nuclei are radioactive as well, they emit radiation
and change into other nuclei. The final products in this
chain are stable, nonradioactive nuclei.
Radiation and radioisotopes reach our bodies daily,
emitted from sources in outer space and from rocks and
soil on Earth. Figure 5.3 shows that radon is the largest
source of radiation to which humans are exposed. This
gas is formed in rocks and soil from the radioactive decay
of radium. Most prevalent in the northern half of the
United States, radon can enter cracks in basement walls
and remain trapped there. Prolonged exposure to high
levels of radioactive radon is thought to lead to lung
cancer. Other radioisotopes, in minute quantities, are
used in medicine as diagnostic tools.
Radiation was discovered at the beginning of the
twentieth century by Antoine Henri Becquerel, Marie
Curie, and Pierre Curie. Decades later other scientists
determined that they could unleash energy by artificially
breaking apart atomic nuclei. Such a process is called
nuclear fission. Scientists discovered that they could pro-
duce the most energy by bombarding the nuclei of an
isotope of uranium called uranium 235, or U-235. The
fission of a U-235 atom releases several neutrons, which
have the potential to penetrate other U-235 atomic nuclei
and cause them to fission. In this way the fission of a
single U-235 atom begins a cascading chain of nuclear
reactions, as shown in Figure 5.4. If this series of reac-
tions is regulated to occur slowly, as it is in nuclear
power plants, the energy emitted can be captured for a
variety of uses, such as generating electricity. If this
series of reactions is allowed to occur all at once, as in
an atomic bomb, the energy emitted is explosive. (Pluto-
nium 239 can also be used to generate a chain reaction
similar to that of U-235.)
Mining Nuclear Fuel
In the United States, U-235 is used as nuclear fuel.
Most of it is found in the form of ore in Wyoming and

New Mexico, where it is mined using methods similar to
those for other metal ores. The one difference is that
uranium mining can expose workers to radioactivity.
Uranium atoms split by themselves at a slow rate, caus-
ing radioactive substances such as radon to accumulate
slowly in the deposits.
After it is mined, uranium must be concentrated,
because uranium ore generally contains only 0.1% ura-
nium metal by weight. To concentrate the uranium, it
goes through a process called milling: The ore is first
crushed, and then various chemicals are poured slowly
through the crushed ore to dissolve the uranium. When
the uranium—called yellowcake because of its color—is
extracted from this chemical solution, it is 85% pure by
weight. However, this uranium is 99.3% nonfissionable
U-238 and only 0.7% fissionable U-235. Other processes
are necessary to create enriched uranium, which has a
higher percentage of fissionable uranium.
To enrich uranium, yellowcake is first converted into
uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Cylinders of this gas are sent
to a gaseous diffusion plant, shown in Figure 5.5, where
the uranium is heated in a furnace (UF6 vaporization). The
enriched uranium is then converted into oxide powder
(UO2), which is made into fingertip-sized fuel pellets.
The pellets are less than one-half inch in diameter, but
each one can produce as much energy as 120 gallons of
oil. The pellets are stacked in rods, which are tubes about
twelve feet long. Many rods are bundled together in
assemblies, and hundreds of these assemblies make up
the core of a nuclear reactor.
DOMESTIC NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCTION
The percentage of U.S. electricity supplied by
nuclear power grew considerably during the 1970s and
early to mid-1980s and then leveled off. (See Figure 5.1.)
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004 (Energy
Information Administration, 2005, http://tonto.eia.doe.
gov/FTPROOT/multifuel/038404.pdf),
nuclear
power
supplied only 4.5% of the total electricity generated in
the United States in 1973. In 2004 nuclear electricity net
generation reached 788.6 billion kilowatt-hours, or about
20% of the nation’s electricity. Thirty-one states had 104
nuclear reactors in operation. Figure 5.6 shows that most
of these reactors were located east of the Mississippi
River.
No new nuclear power plants have been ordered
since 1978, and many have closed. (See Table 5.1.)
As shown in Figure 5.7, the number of operable nuclear
generating units peaked in 1990 with 112 units; as of
2004, 104 units were operating. The decline in nuclear
power plants stems from several related issues. Finan-
cing is difficult to find, and construction has become
more expensive, partly because of longer delays for
licensing, but also because of regulations instituted

CHAPTER 5
NUCLEAR ENERGY
In the early 1970s many Americans favored the use
of nuclear power to generate electricity. Reactors had
been in operation since 1956, providing what appeared
to be cleaner, more efficient energy than power plants
that burned fossil fuels. In addition, the nation had plenty
of uranium, the fuel used in U.S. reactors, so nuclear
plants could help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources.
By the beginning of this century, however, opinion
had turned: Voices were being raised in the United
States—as well as around the world—in opposition to
building additional nuclear power plants. In fact, some
people wanted existing plants shut down. Two inci-
dents—an accident in 1979 at the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, in which the reactor
core lost coolant and partially melted, and the 1986
catastrophe at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, in which
a reactor exploded and released huge amounts of radio-
activity into the atmosphere—greatly increased concerns
about the safety of nuclear power. Reports of design
flaws, cracks, and leaks in other reactors fueled public
fears. Furthermore, the safe disposal of radioactive waste,
which is a by-product of nuclear energy, had become a
scientific and political headache.
Supporters of nuclear power say that it is as safe as
any other form of energy production, as long as it is
monitored properly. They point to the growing problems
related to the use of fossil fuels: global warming, acid
rain, and the damage caused by mining and transporting
fossil fuels. This concern over fossil fuels has led a small
number of environmentalists who had previously opposed
nuclear power to reconsider their position. Nonetheless,
environmental, safety, and economic concerns have
restrained growth in the nuclear industry since the mid-
1970s. Figure 5.1 shows that from 1988 through 2004
nuclear energy’s share of electricity production leveled
off at about 20%.
HOW NUCLEAR ENERGY WORKS
In a nuclear power plant, fuel (uranium in the United
States) in the core of the reactor generates a nuclear
reaction (fission) that produces heat. In a pressurized
water reactor (see Figure 5.2), the heat from the reaction
is carried away by water under high pressure, which heats
a second water stream, producing steam. The steam runs
through a turbine, making the attached generator spin,
which produces electricity. The large cooling towers
associated with nuclear plants cool the steam after it has
run through the turbines. A boiling water reactor works
much the same way, except that the water surrounding
the core boils and directly produces the steam, which is
then piped to the turbine generator.
The challenges faced by those who operate a nuclear
power reactor include finding fuel (uranium 235) that
will sustain a chain reaction; maintaining the reaction at
a level that yields heat but does not escalate out of control
and explode; and coping with the radiation produced by
the chain reaction.
Radioactivity
Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of energy
and/or high-energy particles from the nucleus of an atom.
One type of radioactivity is produced naturally and is
emitted by radioactive isotopes (or radioisotopes), such
as radioactive carbon (carbon 14, or C-14) and radio-
active hydrogen (H-3, or tritium). The energy and high-
energy particles that radioactive isotopes emit include
alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays.
Isotopes are atoms of an element that have the usual
number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in
their nuclei. For example, twelve protons and twelve
neutrons make up the nucleus of the element carbon.
One isotope of carbon, C-14, has twelve protons and
fourteen neutrons in its nucleus.
Energy

Radioisotopes (such as C-14) are unstable isotopes,
and their nuclei decay, or break apart, at a steady rate.
Decaying radioisotopes produce other isotopes as they
emit energy and/or high-energy particles. If the newly
formed nuclei are radioactive as well, they emit radiation
and change into other nuclei. The final products in this
chain are stable, nonradioactive nuclei.
Radiation and radioisotopes reach our bodies daily,
emitted from sources in outer space and from rocks and
soil on Earth. Figure 5.3 shows that radon is the largest
source of radiation to which humans are exposed. This
gas is formed in rocks and soil from the radioactive decay
of radium. Most prevalent in the northern half of the
United States, radon can enter cracks in basement walls
and remain trapped there. Prolonged exposure to high
levels of radioactive radon is thought to lead to lung
cancer. Other radioisotopes, in minute quantities, are
used in medicine as diagnostic tools.
Radiation was discovered at the beginning of the
twentieth century by Antoine Henri Becquerel, Marie
Curie, and Pierre Curie. Decades later other scientists
determined that they could unleash energy by artificially
breaking apart atomic nuclei. Such a process is called
nuclear fission. Scientists discovered that they could pro-
duce the most energy by bombarding the nuclei of an
isotope of uranium called uranium 235, or U-235. The
fission of a U-235 atom releases several neutrons, which
have the potential to penetrate other U-235 atomic nuclei
and cause them to fission. In this way the fission of a
single U-235 atom begins a cascading chain of nuclear
reactions, as shown in Figure 5.4. If this series of reac-
tions is regulated to occur slowly, as it is in nuclear
power plants, the energy emitted can be captured for a
variety of uses, such as generating electricity. If this
series of reactions is allowed to occur all at once, as in
an atomic bomb, the energy emitted is explosive. (Pluto-
nium 239 can also be used to generate a chain reaction
similar to that of U-235.)
Mining Nuclear Fuel
In the United States, U-235 is used as nuclear fuel.
Most of it is found in the form of ore in Wyoming and

New Mexico, where it is mined using methods similar to
those for other metal ores. The one difference is that
uranium mining can expose workers to radioactivity.
Uranium atoms split by themselves at a slow rate, caus-
ing radioactive substances such as radon to accumulate
slowly in the deposits.
After it is mined, uranium must be concentrated,
because uranium ore generally contains only 0.1% ura-
nium metal by weight. To concentrate the uranium, it
goes through a process called milling: The ore is first
crushed, and then various chemicals are poured slowly
through the crushed ore to dissolve the uranium. When
the uranium—called yellowcake because of its color—is
extracted from this chemical solution, it is 85% pure by
weight. However, this uranium is 99.3% nonfissionable
U-238 and only 0.7% fissionable U-235. Other processes
are necessary to create enriched uranium, which has a
higher percentage of fissionable uranium.
To enrich uranium, yellowcake is first converted into
uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Cylinders of this gas are sent
to a gaseous diffusion plant, shown in Figure 5.5, where
the uranium is heated in a furnace (UF6 vaporization). The
enriched uranium is then converted into oxide powder
(UO2), which is made into fingertip-sized fuel pellets.
The pellets are less than one-half inch in diameter, but
each one can produce as much energy as 120 gallons of
oil. The pellets are stacked in rods, which are tubes about
twelve feet long. Many rods are bundled together in
assemblies, and hundreds of these assemblies make up
the core of a nuclear reactor.
DOMESTIC NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCTION
The percentage of U.S. electricity supplied by
nuclear power grew considerably during the 1970s and
early to mid-1980s and then leveled off. (See Figure 5.1.)
According to the Annual Energy Review 2004 (Energy
Information Administration, 2005, http://tonto.eia.doe.
gov/FTPROOT/multifuel/038404.pdf),
nuclear
power
supplied only 4.5% of the total electricity generated in
the United States in 1973. In 2004 nuclear electricity net
generation reached 788.6 billion kilowatt-hours, or about
20% of the nation’s electricity. Thirty-one states had 104
nuclear reactors in operation. Figure 5.6 shows that most
of these reactors were located east of the Mississippi
River.
No new nuclear power plants have been ordered
since 1978, and many have closed. (See Table 5.1.)
As shown in Figure 5.7, the number of operable nuclear
generating units peaked in 1990 with 112 units; as of
2004, 104 units were operating. The decline in nuclear
power plants stems from several related issues. Finan-
cing is difficult to find, and construction has become
more expensive, partly because of longer delays for
licensing, but also because of regulations instituted

following the Three Mile Island accident. Still, output
of electricity at existing plants has increased, achieved
largely through an increase in average capacity factor.
The capacity factor is the proportion of electricity pro-
duced to what could have been produced at full-power
operation. The Annual Energy Review 2004 reveals that
in 2004 the average capacity factor for U.S. nuclear
power plants was 90.5%, an all-time high. Better train-
ing for operators, longer operating cycles between
refueling, and control-system improvements contributed
to increased plant performance.
OUTLOOK FOR DOMESTIC NUCLEAR ENERGY
In its Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (2006, http://
www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/index.html), the Energy Infor-
mation Administration predicted that capacity of nuclear
power plants would increase from 99.6 gigawatts in 2004
to 108.8 gigawatts in 2030. About 6.0 gigawatts of capa-
city would come from new plants and 3.2 gigawatts from
power uprates—an increase in the power output of a
nuclear power plant. A power uprate is accomplished
by adding a more highly enriched uranium fuel to the
existing fuel. The plant must be able to operate safely at
the higher power level.
The forecasts are based on continued operation of
all existing nuclear plants through 2030. Nuclear gen-
eration is predicted to grow from 780 billion kilowatt-
hours in 2004 to 871 billion kilowatt-hours in 2030.
However, the agency notes that even with such an
increase in production, the share that nuclear power
contributes to electricity generation in the United
States will decrease from 20% in 2004 to about 15%
in 2030.
INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION
At 2,523.1 billion kilowatt-hours, nuclear power pro-
vided about 16% of the total 15,843.9 billion kilowatt-
hours of electricity produced in the world during 2003.
(See Table 5.2.) This amounted to 6.4% of the world’s
total energy, according to the Annual Energy Review
2004. As of December 31, 2004, electricity was being
produced by 440 nuclear plants worldwide. Fifty-two
other plants were under construction, on order, or had
had their construction halted (Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission, Information Digest 2005–2006, 2005, http://
www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr
1350/).
In 2003 the United States led the world in nuclear
power electricity generation with 763.7 billion kilowatt-
hours, followed by France (419 billion) and Japan
(237.2 billion). (See Table 5.2.) Together the three
countries generated 56% of the world’s nuclear electric
power. About 78% of France’s electrical power is pro-
duced by nuclear energy, followed by Belgium (57%),
Sweden (49%), and Switzerland (41%). Japan produced
23% of its electricity by nuclear power generation, and
the United States 20%. Canada produced less than 13%
of its electricity with nuclear power.
Worldwide, the Energy Information Administration
projected nuclear generating capacity would increase
slightly from 361 gigawatts in 2002 to 422 gigawatts in
2025 (International Energy Outlook 2005, 2005, http://
www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/ieo05/index.html).
Some
countries whose capacities are projected to increase are:
• Canada, from 10.6 gigawatts in 2002 to 14.5 gigawatts
in 2020, then decreasing to 13.8 gigawatts by 2025
• Japan, from 45.9 gigawatts to 54.8 gigawatts by 2025

2025

Some countries were planning to cut nuclear capa-
city, largely for environmental reasons. Sweden, for
example, had legislated a nuclear phase-out by 2010 after
a referendum in 1980. However, because of economic
considerations, only two of its nuclear reactors had been
shut down by early 2006.
AGING NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS
At some point, the nuclear plants now operating
worldwide may need to be retired. Most of them were
designed to last about thirty years. Some plants showed
serious levels of deterioration after as few as fifteen
years; some have lasted well beyond their thirty-year
expectations. There are three methods of retiring, or
decommissioning, a reactor. Safe enclosure, or mothbal-
ling, involves removing the fuel from the plant, monitor-
ing any radioactive contamination (which is usually very
low or nonexistent), and guarding the structure to prevent
anyone from entering until eventual dismantling and
decontamination activities occur. Entombment, which
was used at Chernobyl, involves permanently encasing
the structure in a long-lived material such as concrete.
This procedure allows the radioactive material to remain
safely on-site. Immediate dismantling involves deconta-
minating and tearing down the facility within a few
months or years. This method is initially more expensive
than the other options but removes the long-term costs of
monitoring both the structure and the radiation levels. It
also frees the site for other uses, including the construction
of another nuclear power plant. Nuclear power companies
are also seeking alternative uses for nuclear shells, includ-
ing the conversion of old nuclear plants to gas-fired plants.

Paying for the closing, decontamination, or disman-
tling of nuclear plants has become an issue of intense
public debate. The industry contends that the cost of
decommissioning retired plants and handling radioactive
wastes will continue to escalate, causing serious financial
problems for electric utilities.

In 2001 the Generation IV International Forum, a
group of nuclear nations, agreed to work together to
create a new generation of nuclear reactors. Their intent
was to develop new systems by 2030 that ‘‘present sig-
nificant improvements in economics, safety and reliabil-
ity and sustainability over currently operating reactor
technologies’’
(Generation
IV
International
Forum,
http://gif.inel.gov/roadmap/). As of 2006 the members
included Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the European Union,
France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
The group chose six nuclear power technologies for
development:
• Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR)—This technology
would provide a closed system, helium-cooled reactor
that minimizes long-lived radioactive waste by recy-
cling it.
• Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR)—With core
outlet temperatures reaching 1,000 Celsius (1,832
Fahrenheit), the VHTR would be used to produce
hydrogen and to meet specific high-temperature heat-
ing needs of the petrochemical industry and others.
• Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR)—SWCR
is a high-temperature, high-pressure water-cooled reac-
tor that increases efficiency by operating above the
thermodynamic critical point of water. Water under
high pressure does not boil and turn to steam; the
thermodynamic critical point of water refers to the
temperature and pressure at which the liquid state
ceases to exist and the liquid and gaseous forms become
indistinguishable. For water, this point is 374 Celsius
(705 Fahrenheit).
• Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR)—Intended for
electricity generation, this system uses a sodium-
cooled reactor and a closed fuel cycle to increase
safety and reduce high-level radioactive waste.
• Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR)—Designed with
small electricity grids and developing countries in
mind, the LFR proposes a factory-built system that
would need refueling only every fifteen to twenty
years. It features a fast-spectrum lead or liquid metal-
cooled reactor and a closed cycle for reducing waste.
• Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)—In this system, the fuel
is a liquid mixture of sodium, zirconium, and uranium
fluorides, which eliminates the need for fuel produc-
tion. By-products can be recycled back into the fuel
mixture.
Each of the new technologies builds on the knowl-
edge gained during the three other periods of nuclear
reactor development: Generation I—the experimental
reactors developed in the 1950s and 1960s; Generation
II—large, central-station nuclear power reactors, such as
the 104 plants still operating in the United States, built in
the 1970s and 1980s; and Generation III—the advanced
light-water reactors built in the 1990s, primarily in East
Asia, to meet that region’s expanding electricity needs. In
February 2005 the United States joined Canada, France,
Japan, and the United Kingdom in an agreement to
develop these six nuclear energy systems. In February
2006 the United States also signed an agreement with
France and Japan to work together to develop sodium-
cooled fast reactor systems.
NUCLEAR SAFETY
Safety has been an issue from the beginning of the
industry. For example, some plant sites, especially those
near earthquake fault lines, have raised serious questions
for governments, industry leaders, and environmentalists.
Plants can be shut down for a variety of reasons. For
example, in 1987 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shut
down the Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Delta, Pennsylva-
nia, because control-room operators were found sleeping
on duty. In February 2005 the Kewaunee power station in
Carlton, Wisconsin, was shut down after it was discovered
that emergency shutdown systems could be compromised
by flooding from water storage tanks located in an adjacent
part of the plant. Although no flood actually occurred,
operations at the plant were halted until the shutdown
systems could be protected from a potential water threat.
Most safety questions, however, have been focused by
major accidents since the late 1970s.

Three Mile Island
On March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear
facility near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the
worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. Information
released several years after the accident revealed that Unit
2, one of the reactors operating at the site, came much
closer to meltdown than either the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission or the industry had previously indicated.
Temperatures inside the reactor, which were first said to
have reached 3,500 Fahrenheit, are now known to have
reached at least 4,800 Fahrenheit. The temperature
needed to melt uranium dioxide fuel is 5,080 Fahrenheit.
When meltdown occurs, an uncontrolled explosion may
result, unlike the controlled nuclear reaction of normal
operation.
The emergency system at Three Mile Island was
designed to dump water on the hot core of the reactor
and spray water into the reactor building to stop the
production of steam. During the accident, however, the
valves leading to the emergency water pumps closed.
Another valve was stuck in the open position, drawing
water away from the core, which then became partially
uncovered and began to melt.
The accident resulted in no deaths or injuries to plant
workers or the nearby community. On average, area
residents were exposed to less radiation than that of a
chest X-ray. Nevertheless, the incident raised concerns
about nuclear safety, which resulted in more rigorous
safety standards in the nuclear power industry and at
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Antinuclear senti-
ment was fueled as well, heightening Americans’ wari-
ness of nuclear power as an energy source.
The nuclear reactor in Unit 2 at Three Mile Island
has been in monitored storage since it underwent cleanup.
Operation of the reactor in Unit 1 resumed in 1985.
Chernobyl
On April 26, 1986, the most serious nuclear accident
ever occurred at Chernobyl, a nuclear plant in what is now
Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union). At least thirty-one
people died and hundreds were injured when one of the
four reactors exploded during a badly run test. Millions of
people were exposed to some levels of radiation when
radioactive particles were released into the atmosphere.
About 350,000 people were eventually evacuated from the
area, including residents of what are now the neighboring
nations of Belarus and the Russian Federation, who were
endangered by fallout carried by prevailing winds.
The cleanup was a huge project. Helicopters dropped
tons of limestone, sand, clay, lead, and boron on the
smoldering reactor to stop the radiation leakage and
reduce the heat. Workers built a giant steel and cement
sarcophagus to entomb the remains of the reactor and
contain the radioactive waste.
According
to
the
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency (Chernobyl’s Legacy: Health, Environmental,
and Socio-Economic Impacts, 2005, http://www.iaea.org/
Publications/Booklets/Chernobyl/chernobyl.pdf), about
1,000 people involved in the initial cleanup, including
emergency workers and the military, received high doses
of radiation. Eventually more than 600,000 people would
be involved in decontamination and containment activ-
ities. The long-term effects of whatever exposure they
received is being monitored. The most measurable effect
of the radiation, according to the agency, has been the
incidence of thyroid cancer in children. At least 4,000
children—considered a very large number, given the size
of the population—have been treated for the cancer,
almost all successfully.
While some of the evacuated land has been declared
fit for habitation again, several areas that received heavy
concentrations of radiation are expected to be closed for
decades. The three remaining nuclear reactors at Cherno-
byl continue to operate. The site itself is off-limits to all
but official personnel.
An International Agreement on Safety
In September 1994 forty nations, including the Uni-
ted States, signed the International Convention on
Nuclear Safety, an agreement that requires them to shut
down nuclear power plants if necessary safety measures
cannot be guaranteed. The agreement applies to land-
based civil nuclear power plants and seeks to avert acci-
dents like the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl. Ukraine,
which inherited the Chernobyl plant after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, signed the agreement. Signers must
submit reports on atomic installations and, if necessary,
make improvements to upgrade safety at the sites. Neigh-
boring countries may call for an urgent study if they are
concerned about a reactor’s safety and the potential fall-
out that could affect their own population or crops.
RADIOACTIVE WASTE
Working in a laboratory in Chicago, Illinois, in
1942, physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–54) assembled
enough uranium to cause a nuclear fission reaction.
His discovery transformed both warfare and energy
production. The experiment also produced a small
packet of radioactive waste material that may remain
dangerous for 100,000 years. That first radioactive
waste lies buried under a foot of concrete and two feet
of dirt on a hillside in Illinois.
Radioactive waste is produced at all stages of the
nuclear fuel cycle, from the initial mining of the uranium
to the final disposal of the spent fuel from the reactor.
Radioactive waste is a term that encompasses a broad
Energy
Nuclear Energy
73

range of material with widely varying characteristics.
Some is barely radioactive and safe to handle, while other
types are intensely hot and highly radioactive. Some
waste decays to safe levels of radioactivity in a matter
of days or weeks, while other types will remain danger-
ous for thousands of years. The U.S. Department of
Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have
defined the major types of radioactive waste.
Uranium Mill Tailings
Uranium mill tailings are sandlike wastes produced
in uranium refining operations. Although they emit low
levels of radiation, their large volumes (10 million to 15
million tons annually) pose a hazard, particularly from
radon emissions and groundwater contamination. The
dangers of uranium mill tailings were not realized until
the early 1970s, so many miners and residents of the
western United States were exposed to them. Cancer
incidences are high among miners who worked prior to
the 1970s. In addition, the World Information Source on
Energy reports that those residing near uranium mills
have shown increased risks of leukemia, lung and renal
cancer, and birth defects (http://www.wise-uranium.org/
uhr.html).
Low-Level Waste
Low-level waste, which contains lesser levels of
radioactivity, includes trash (such as wiping rags, swabs,
and syringes), contaminated clothing (such as shoe cov-
ers and protective gloves), and hardware (such as lumi-
nous dials, filters, and tools). This waste comes from
nuclear reactors, industrial users, government users (but
not nuclear weapons sites), research universities, and
medical facilities. In general, low-level waste decays
relatively quickly (in ten to one hundred years).
High-Level Waste
Spent nuclear fuel (used reactor fuel) is high-level
radioactive waste. Uranium fuel can be used for twelve to
eighteen months, after which it is no longer as efficient in
splitting its atoms and producing the heat needed to
generate electricity. It must be removed from the reactor
and replaced with fresh fuel. Some of the spent fuel is
reprocessed to recover the usable uranium and plutonium,
but the radioactive material that remains is dangerous for
thousands of years.
Transuranic (TRU) Wastes
Transuranic wastes are eleven man-made radioactive
elements with atomic numbers greater than that of ura-
nium (ninety-two) and therefore beyond (trans-) uranium
(-uranic) on the periodic table of the elements. Their
half-lives—the time it takes for half the radioisotopes
present
in
a
sample
to
decay
to
nonradioactive
elements—are thousands of years. They are found in
trash produced mainly by nuclear weapons plants and
are therefore part of the nuclear waste problem but not
directly the concern of nuclear power utilities.
Mixed Waste
Mixed waste is high-level, low-level, or transuranic
waste that also contains hazardous nonradioactive waste.
Such waste poses serious institutional problems, because
the radioactive portion is regulated by the Department of
Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the
Atomic Energy Act (PL 83-703), while the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency regulates the nonradioactive ele-
ments under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (PL 95-510).
RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL
Disposing of radioactive waste is unquestionably one
of the major problems associated with the development
of nuclear power; radioactive waste is also a by-product
of nuclear weapons plants, hospitals, and scientific
research. Although federal policy is based on the assump-
tion that radioactive waste can be disposed of safely, new
storage and disposal facilities for all types of radioactive
waste have frequently been delayed or blocked by con-
cerns about safety, health, and the environment.
The highly toxic wastes must be isolated from the
environment until the radioactivity decays to a safe level.
In the case of plutonium, for example, the half-life (or,
the point at which half of the radioactive nuclei have
decayed) is 26,000 years. At that rate, it will take at least
100,000 years before radioactive plutonium is no longer
dangerous. Any facilities built to store such materials
must last at least that long.
Regulation of Radioactive Waste Disposal
As of January 2006 the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion had entered into agreements with thirty-three states
to regulate the management, storage, and disposal of
certain nuclear waste within their borders.
Disposal of Uranium Mill Tailings
Mill tailings are usually deposited in large piles next
to the mill that processed the ore. In 1978 Congress
passed the Uranium Mill Tailing Radiation Control Act
(PL 95-604), which requires mill owners to follow Envir-
onmental Protection Agency standards for cleanup of
uranium and thorium after milling operations have per-
manently closed. The companies must cover the mill
tailings to control the release of radon gas for 1,000
years. Figure 5.8 shows the locations of uranium mill
tailings disposal sites, which are close to deposits of
uranium ore.

Disposal of Low-level Waste
According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as
of March 2005 three low-level licensed nuclear waste
facilities were operating in the United States (Information
Digest, 2005–2006 Edition): in Barnwell, South Carolina,
in Richland, Washington, and in a remote part of Utah,
where Envirocare of Utah accepts large amounts of mill
tailings and low-level waste, such as contaminated soil or
debris from demolished buildings. Four low-level radio-
active waste facilities have been closed: in West Valley,
New York (closed 1975); in Morehead/Maxey Flats,
Kentucky (closed 1977); in Sheffield, Illinois (closed
1978); and in Beatty, Nevada (closed 1993).
The design of a low-level waste facility is shown in
Figure 5.9. Wastes are buried in shallow underground
sites in specially designed canisters. Underground storage
may or may not include protection by concrete vaults.
The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amend-
ments Act of 1985 (PL 99-240) encouraged states to enter
into compacts, which are legal agreements among states
for low-level radioactive waste disposal. Figure 5.10
shows these compacts. Although each compact is respon-
sible for the development of disposal capacity for the
low-level waste generated within the compact, new dis-
posal sites have yet to be built. As Figure 5.10 shows,
two of the three operational low-level sites are located in
the Northwest Compact and one is in the Atlantic
Compact. Nuclear power facilities located in compacts
without low-level waste disposal sites must petition the
compact to export their low-level radioactive waste to
one of the three operating disposal sites.
Disposal of High-Level Waste
A major step toward shifting the responsibility for
disposal of high-level radioactive wastes (spent fuel)
from the nuclear power industry to the federal govern-
ment was taken in 1982, when Congress passed the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act (PL 97-425). It established
national policy; set a detailed timetable for the disposal
and management of high-level nuclear waste; and author-
ized construction of the first high-level nuclear waste
repository. A 1987 amendment to the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act directed investigation of Yucca Mountain in
Nevada as a potential site. In early 2006 no long-term,
permanent
disposal
repository
for
high-level
waste
existed. While waiting for the development of the Yucca
Mountain site, spent fuel was being stored at away-from-
reactor storage facilities, such as the General Electric
Company facility in Morris, Illinois, or at the nuclear
power plants that generated the waste.
In July 2002 the Congress approved the Yucca
Mountain site. The State of Nevada challenged the deci-
sion, but in 2004 federal courts dismissed the challenge.
In April 2006 the Secretary of Energy announced propo-
sals to facilitate licensing and construction of the reposi-
tory, which was expected to take about five years.
Figure 5.11 shows the location of the proposed dis-
posal facility at Yucca Mountain. Aboveground struc-
tures for handling and packaging nuclear waste would
cover approximately 400 acres and be surrounded by a
three-mile buffer zone. Underground about 1,400 acres
would be mined, with tunnels leading to areas where
sealed metal containers would be placed. This type of
deep geologic disposal is widely considered by govern-
ments, scientists, and engineers to be the best option for
isolating highly radioactive waste.
The repository would be designed to contain radioactive
material by using layers of man-made and natural barriers.
Regulations require that a repository isolate waste until the
radiation decays to a level that is about the same as that from
a natural underground uranium deposit. This decay time was
originally estimated at be about 10,000 years, but the
National Academy of Sciences has more recently recom-
mended a higher standard of about 300,000 years.
After the repository has been filled to capacity, reg-
ulations require the Department of Energy to keep the
facility open and to monitor it for at least fifty years from
the fill date. Eventually, the repository shafts would be
filled with rock and earth and sealed. At ground level,

facilities would be removed and, as much as possible, the
site returned to its original condition.
Scientists expect some of the man-made barriers in a
repository to break down over thousands of years. Once that
happens, natural barriers will be counted on to stop or slow
the movement of radiation particles. The most likely way for
particles to reach humans and the environment would be
through water, which is why the low water tables at Yucca
Mountain are so crucial. In addition, Yucca Mountain con-
tains minerals called zeolites that would stick to the particles
and slow their movement throughout the environment.
The long delay in providing disposal sites for spent
nuclear fuel has been expensive for the industry. Several
aging power plants are being maintained at a cost of $20

million per reactor per year simply because there is no
place to send the waste once the plants are decommis-
sioned. Table 5.3 shows that as of 2002 more than 47,000
metric tonnes (tons) of nuclear uranium waste were sit-
ting in spent fuel pools at the 104 operating and nineteen
permanently closed nuclear power plants.
Disposal of Transuranic Waste
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is the first disposal
facility licensed to dispose of transuranic waste, and does
not accept waste from commercial sources or electrical
power plants. It opened in March 1999 in the desert in
southeastern New Mexico. Its disposal rooms were
mined 2,150 feet underground in a 2,000-foot-thick salt
formation that has been stable for more than 200 mil-
lion years. Beginning with one or two shipments per
week, operations grew over the years, expanding to an
all-time high of 33 shipments received during a single
week in February 2006. In September 2006 the plant
received its 5,000th shipment of transuranic waste and
announced that thirteen sites around the country, most
notably the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology site
in Colorado, had been completely cleaned-up by that
time.

Disposal of Mixed Waste
Several commercial facilities in the United States
accept mixed waste. However, only the Envirocare facil-
ity in Clive, Utah, is permitted to accept solid mixed
waste. It stores the waste in aboveground, capped
embankments designed to last at least 1,000 years. The
storage facility is located in an isolated area twenty miles
from the nearest water supply and more than forty miles
from the nearest populated area. Containment efforts are
supported by area soil and weather conditions, as well,
with little permeability in the clay soil and fewer than six
inches of rain per year.
Sites in Florida, Tennessee, and Texas offer storage
for liquid or sludge materials or use thermal or chemical
processes to neutralize them. Among them, Diversified
Scientific Services, Inc. in Kingston, Tennessee, gener-
ates electrical power from liquid mixed waste through an
industrial boiler system, and Texas-based NSSI provides
drum storage.

CHAPTER 6
RENEWABLE ENERGY
WHAT IS RENEWABLE ENERGY?
Imagine energy sources that use no oil, produce no
pollution, create no radioactive waste, cannot be affected
by political events and cartels, and yet are economical.
Although it sounds impossible, some experts claim that
technological advances could make wide use of renew-
able energy sources possible within a few decades. They
may become substantially better energy sources than
fossil fuels and nuclear power.
Renewable energy is naturally regenerated. Sources
include the sun (solar), wind, water (hydropower), vege-
tation (biomass), and the heat of the earth (geothermal).
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Before the eighteenth century, most energy came
from renewable sources. People burned wood for heat,
used sails to harness the wind and propel boats, and
installed waterwheels on streams to run mills that ground
grain. The large-scale shift to nonrenewable energy
sources began in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution,
a period marked by the rise of factories, first in Europe and
then in North America. As demand for energy grew, coal
replaced wood as the main fuel. Coal was the most effi-
cient fuel for the steam engine, one of the most important
inventions of the Industrial Revolution.
Until the early 1970s most Americans were uncon-
cerned about the sources of the nation’s energy. Supplies
of coal and oil, which together provided more than 90% of
U.S. energy, were believed to be plentiful. The decades
preceding the 1970s were characterized by cheap gasoline
and little public discussion of energy conservation.
That carefree approach to energy consumption ended
in the 1970s. An oil crisis, caused in part by the devaluation
of the dollar, but largely by an oil embargo by the Organ-
ization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, made Americans
acutely aware of their dependence on foreign energy.
Throughout the United States, people waited in line to fill
their gas tanks—in some places gasoline was rationed—
and lower heat settings for offices and homes were encour-
aged. In a country where mobility and convenience were
highly valued, the oil crisis was a shock to the system.
Developing alternative sources of energy to supplement
and perhaps eventually replace fossil fuels became sud-
denly important. As a result, the administration of President
Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) encouraged federal funding for
research into alternative energy sources.
In 1978 Congress passed the Public Utilities Regula-
tory Policies Act (PL 95-617), which was designed to
help the struggling alternative energy industry. The act
exempted small alternative producers from state and fed-
eral utility regulations and required existing local utilities
to buy electricity from them. The renewable energy
industries grew rapidly, gaining experience, improving
technologies, and lowering costs. This law was the single
most important factor in the development of the commer-
cial renewable energy market.
In the 1980s President Ronald Reagan favored
private-sector financing, so he proposed the reduction or
elimination of federal expenditures for alternative energy
sources. Although federal funds were severely cut, the
U.S. Department of Energy continued to support some
research and development. President Bill Clinton’s
administration reemphasized the importance of renew-
able energy and increased funding in several areas. The
administration of President George W. Bush supported
funding for research and development of renewable tech-
nologies and tax credits for the purchase of hybrid and
alternative-fuel cars.
DOMESTIC RENEWABLE ENERGY USAGE
In 2004 the United States consumed approximately
6.1 quadrillion Btu of renewable energy, about 6% of the
nation’s total energy consumption. (See Table 6.1 and
Energy
81

Figure 6.1.) Biomass sources (wood, waste, and alcohol)
contributed 2.8 quadrillion Btu, while hydroelectric
power provided 2.7 quadrillion Btu. Together, biomass
and hydroelectric power provided more than 90% of
renewable energy in 2004. Geothermal energy was the
third-largest source, with about 0.3 quadrillion Btu. Solar
power contributed 0.06 quadrillion Btu, and wind pro-
vided 0.1 quadrillion Btu.
BIOMASS ENERGY
Biomass refers to organic material such as plant and
animal waste, wood, seaweed and algae, and garbage.
The use of biomass is not without environmental pro-
blems. Deforestation can occur from widespread use of
wood, especially if forests are clear-cut, which can result
in soil erosion and mudslides. Burning wood, like burn-
ing fossil fuels, also pollutes the environment. Biomass
can be burned directly or converted to biofuel by thermo-
chemical conversion and biochemical conversion.
Direct Burning
Direct combustion is the easiest and most commonly
used method of using biomass as fuel. Materials such as
dry wood or agricultural wastes are chopped and burned
to produce steam, electricity, or heat for industries, uti-
lities, and homes. Industrial-size wood boilers are operat-
ing throughout the country. The burning of agricultural
wastes is also becoming more widespread. In Florida,
sugarcane producers use the residue from harvested cane
to generate much of their energy. Residential use of wood
as fuel generated 332 trillion Btu in 2004, considerably
less than the 860 trillion–940 trillion Btu generated in
homes in the 1980s (Energy Information Administration,
Annual Energy Review 2004, 2005).

Thermochemical Conversion
Thermochemical conversion involves heating bio-
mass in an oxygen-free or low-oxygen atmosphere,
which transforms the material into simpler substances
that can be used as fuels. Products such as charcoal and
methanol are produced this way.
Biochemical Conversion
Biochemical conversion uses enzymes, fungi, or
other microorganisms to convert high-moisture biomass
into either liquid or gaseous fuels. Bacteria convert man-
ure, agricultural wastes, paper, and algae into methane,
which is used as fuel. Sewage treatment plants have used
anaerobic (oxygen-free) digestion for many years to gen-
erate methane gas. Small-scale digesters have been used
on farms, primarily in Europe and Asia, for hundreds of
years. Biogas pits (a biomass-based technology) are a
significant source of energy in China.
Another type of biochemical conversion, fermenta-
tion, uses yeast to decompose carbohydrates, yielding
ethyl alcohol (ethanol), a colorless, nearly odorless, flam-
mable liquid, and carbon dioxide. Most of the ethanol
manufactured for use as fuel in the United States is
derived from corn, wood, and sugar. Ethanol is mixed

with gasoline to create gasohol, which is sold in three
blends: 10% gasohol, which is a mixture of 10% ethanol
and 90% gasoline; 7.7% gasohol, which is at least 7.7%
ethanol but less than 10%; and 5.7% gasohol, which is at
least 5.7% ethanol but less than 7.7%. The Federal High-
way Administration estimated that in 2003 Americans
used about 20.5 billion gallons of 10% gasohol, up from
16.3 billion gallons in 2000. In 2003 Americans used
slightly more than 12 billion gallons of less-than-10%
gasohol.
The use of ethanol is expected to increase. The
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL 109-58) required fuel
suppliers to nearly double their use of ethanol by 2012
to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign fuel
sources. Fuel distributors are also being required by
several major cities and more than twenty-five states to
remove the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or
MTBE, from gasoline. MTBE is known to contaminate
groundwater. Many suppliers are replacing the additive
with ethanol.
Automobiles can be built to run directly on ethanol or
on any mixture of gasoline and ethanol. However, etha-
nol is difficult and expensive to produce in bulk. Devel-
opment of this fuel source may depend more on the
political support of legislators from farming states and a
desire for energy independence than on savings at the gas
pump.
Some scientists have suggested that ethanol made
from refuse—for example, corncobs and rice hulls—
could liberate the alcohol fuel industry from its depen-
dence on food crops, such as corn and sugarcane, and
make the fuel cheaper. Worldwide enough corncobs and
rice hulls are left after crop production to produce more
than 40 billion gallons of ethanol. Other scientists argue
that wood-derived ethanol could eventually create a
sustainable liquid fuel industry. If new trees were planted
to replace those that were cut for fuel, they say, those
trees would not only be available for harvesting years
later but, in the meantime, would also alleviate global
warming by processing carbon dioxide. Other scientists
counter with the warning that an increased demand for
wood for transportation fuels might accelerate the
destruction of old-growth forests and endanger ecosys-
tems.
Another alternative fuel is ethanol-85 (E-85), which
is a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% unleaded gasoline. In
2006 there were approximately 1.5 million automobiles
on U.S. roads capable of using E-85 as a fuel. Such
vehicles are called ‘‘flex-fuel’’ vehicles because they
can run on E-85, gasohol, or gasoline.
Methanol (methyl alcohol) fuels have also been
tested successfully. Using methanol instead of diesel fuel
virtually eliminates sulfur emissions and reduces other
environmental pollutants usually emitted from trucks and
buses. Producing methanol is costly, however.
Burning biofuels in vehicle engines is part of the
‘‘carbon cycle,’’ in which vegetation makes use of the
products of automobile combustion. (See Figure 6.2.)
Automobile exhaust generated from fossil fuels, how-
ever, contains pollutants. In addition, generating exces-
sive amounts of carbon dioxide from either fossil fuels or
biofuels is thought to add to global warming because it
traps heat in the atmosphere.
Municipal Waste Recovery
Each year millions of tons of garbage are buried in
landfills and city dumps. This method of disposal is
becoming increasingly costly, and many landfills across
the nation are near capacity. Some communities discov-
ered that they could solve both problems—cost and capa-
city—by constructing waste-to-energy plants. Not only is
the garbage burned and reduced in volume by 90%,
energy in the form of steam or electricity is also gener-
ated in a cost-effective way.
Use of municipal waste as fuel has increased steadily
since the 1980s. According to the Annual Energy Review
2004, municipal waste (including landfill gas, sludge
waste, tires, and agricultural by-products) generated
22.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2004, up from
0.1 billion kilowatt-hours in 1982. (See Table 6.2.)
MASS BURN SYSTEMS. Most waste-to-energy plants in
the United States use the mass burn system (also called
direct combustion). Because the waste does not have to
be sorted or prepared before burning—except for remov-
ing obviously noncombustible, oversized objects—the
system eliminates expensive sorting, shredding, and
transportation machinery that may be prone to break
down. The waste is simply carried to the plant in trash
trucks and dropped into a storage pit. Overhead cranes
lift the garbage into a hopper that controls the amount of
waste that is fed into the furnace. The burning waste
produces heat, which is used to produce steam. The steam
can be used directly for industrial needs or can be sent
through a turbine to power a generator to produce elec-
tricity.
REFUSE-DERIVED FUEL SYSTEMS. At refuse-derived
fuel plants, waste is first processed to remove noncombus-
tible objects and to create homogeneous and uniformly
sized fuel. Large items such as bedsprings, dangerous
materials, and flammable liquids are removed by hand.
The trash is then shredded and screened to remove glass,
rocks, and other material that cannot be burned. The
remaining material is usually sifted a second time with an
air separator to yield fluff, which is placed in storage bins. It
can also be compressed into pellets or briquettes for long-
term storage. This fuel can be used by itself or with other
fuels, such as coal or wood.

PERFORMANCE OF WASTE-TO-ENERGY SYSTEMS. Most
waste-to-energy systems can produce two to four pounds of
steamforeverypoundofgarbageburned.A1,000-ton-per-day
mass burn system usually converts an average of 310,250 tons
of trash each year and recovers 2 trillion Btu of energy. In
addition, the plant will emit 96,000 tons of ash (32% of waste
input) for landfill disposal. A refuse-derived fuel plant
produces less ash but sends almost the same amount of waste
tothelandfillbecauseofthenoncombustiblesthatareremoved
from the trash before it is burned.
DISADVANTAGES OF WASTE-TO-ENERGY PLANTS. The
major problem with increasing the use of municipal waste-
to-energy plants is their effect on the environment. The
emission of particles into the air is partially controlled by
electrostatic precipitators, and many gases can be eliminated
by proper combustion techniques. However, large amounts
of dioxin (a dangerous air pollutant) and other toxins are
often emitted from these plants. Noise from trucks, fans,
and processing equipment can also be unpleasant for nearby
residents.
Landfill Gas Recovery
Landfills contain a large amount of biodegradable mat-
ter that is compacted and covered with soil. Methanogens,
which are anaerobic microorganisms, thrive in this oxygen-
depleted environment. They metabolize the biodegradable
matter in the landfill, producing methane gas and carbon
dioxide as by-products. In the past, as landfills aged, these
gases built up and leaked out, which prompted some com-
munities to drill holes in landfills and burn off the methane to
prevent dangerously large amounts from exploding.
The energy crisis of the 1970s made landfill methane
gas an energy resource too valuable to waste. The first
landfill gas recovery site was built in 1975 at the Palos
Verdes Landfill in Rolling Hills Estates, California. By
December 2005, according to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA), 395 landfill gas energy sites were
operating in the United States and another 600 landfill
sites had been identified for potential development (http://
www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/index.htm). The EPA estimated

that landfill gas generated about 9 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity per year.
In a typical operation, garbage is allowed to decompose
for several months. When a sufficient amount of methane
gas has developed, it is piped to a generating plant, where it
is used to create electricity. In its purest form, methane gas
can be used like natural gas. Depending on the extraction
rates, most sites can produce gas for about twenty years.
Besides the energy provided, tapping the methane reduces
landfill odors and the chances of explosions.
HYDROPOWER
In the past, flowing water turned waterwheels of
mills to grind grain; today hydropower plants convert
the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy,
turning turbines to create electricity. Hydropower is the
most widely used renewable energy source in the world.
In the United States it provided 75% of all electricity
produced from renewable sources in 2004. (See Table
6.2.)
Advantages and Disadvantages of Hydropower
Today hydropower is the only means of storing large
quantities of energy for almost instant use. Water is held
in a large reservoir behind a dam, with a hydroelectric
power plant below. The dam creates a height from which
water can flow at a fast rate. When it reaches the power
plant, it pushes the turbine blades attached to the elec-
trical generator. Whenever power is needed, the valves
are opened, the moving water spins the turbines, and the
generator quickly produces electricity.
Nearly all the best sites for large hydropower plants
are being used in the United States. Small hydropower
plants are expensive to build but may eventually become
economical because of their low operating costs. One of
the disadvantages of small hydropower generators is their
reliance on rain and melting snow to fill reservoirs;
drought conditions can affect the water supply. Addition-
ally, environmental groups strongly protest the construc-
tion of new dams, pointing to ruined streams, dried up
waterfalls, and altered aquatic habitats.
The Future of Hydropower
The last federally funded hydropower dam, com-
pleted by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1986, was the
Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake on the Savannah River,
which forms the border between South Carolina and Geor-
gia. Since then, local governments have been required to
contribute half the cost of any new dam proposed in the
United States. While expansion and efficiency improve-
ments at existing dams offer significant potential for addi-
tional energy, hydropower’s future contribution to U.S.
energy generation should remain relatively constant.
Additional supplies of hydroelectric power for the United
States will likely come from Canada.
Most of the new development in hydropower is
occurring in developing nations, which see it as an effec-
tive method of supplying power to growing populations.
These massive public-works projects usually require
huge amounts of money—most of it borrowed from the
developed world. Hydroelectric dams are considered
worth the cost and potential environmental threats
because they bring cheap electric power to the citizenry.
In May 2006 the Chinese government announced that
construction was completed on the world’s largest dam,
the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in
Hubei province, China (http://english.gov.cn/2006-05/
20/content_286525.htm). Five times the size of the Hoover

Dam in the United States, the dam is 185 meters (607 feet)
tall and 2,309 meters (7,575 feet, or 1.4 miles) in length. It
is scheduled to begin generating power in 2009, after its
twenty-six generators have been installed and water has
filled the giant reservoir. Once operational, the dam is
expected to produce 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electri-
city per year.
GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
Although bubbling hot springs became public baths
as early as ancient Rome, using hot water and under-
ground steam to produce power is a relatively recent
development. Electricity was first generated from natural
steam in Italy in 1904. The world’s first natural steam
power plant was built in 1958 in a volcanic region of
New Zealand. A field of twenty-eight geothermal power
plants covering thirty square miles in northern California
was completed in 1960.
What Is Geothermal Energy?
Geothermal energy is the natural, internal heat of
Earth trapped in rock formations deep underground. Only
a fraction of it can be extracted, usually through large
fractures in Earth’s crust. Hot springs, geysers, and
fumaroles (holes in or near volcanoes from which vapor
escapes) are the most easily exploitable sources. (See
Figure 6.3.) Geothermal reservoirs provide hot water or
steam that can be used for heating buildings and proces-
sing food. Pressurized hot water or steam can also be
directed toward turbines, which spin, generating electri-
city for residential and commercial customers.
Types of Geothermal Energy
Like most natural energy sources, geothermal energy
is usable only when it is concentrated in one spot—in
this case, in what is known as a ‘‘thermal reservoir.’’
There are four types of reservoirs, including hydrothermal

reservoirs, dry rock reservoirs, geopressurized reservoirs,
and magma. Most of the known reservoirs for geothermal
power in the United States are located west of the Missis-
sippi River, and the highest-temperature geothermal
resources occur for the most part west of the Rocky Moun-
tains.
HYDROTHERMAL RESERVOIRS. Hydrothermal reser-
voirs are underground pools of hot water covered by a
permeable formation through which steam escapes under
pressure. Once at the surface the steam is purified and
piped directly to the electrical generating station. These
systems are the cheapest and simplest form of geothermal
energy. The Geysers thermal field, ninety miles north of
San Francisco, California, is the world’s largest source of
geothermal power. According to the Web site of Calpine
Corporation, which operates nineteen of the twenty-one
power generating plants at the site, as of 2006 The
Geysers generated enough electricity to satisfy the power
needs of a city the size of San Francisco and provided
nearly 60% of the electricity used in the region extending
northward from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon
border (http://www.geysers.com/).
DRY ROCK. These formations are the most common
geothermal sources, especially in the West. However,
reservoirs of this type are typically more than 6,000 feet
below the surface, which poses numerous difficulties. To
tap them, water is injected into hot rock formations that
have been fractured, and the resulting steam or water is
collected. Hot dry rock technologies were developed and
tested at New Mexico’s Fenton Hill plant, which operated
between 1970 and 1996.
GEOPRESSURIZED RESERVOIRS. These sedimentary
formations contain hot water and methane gas. Supplies
of geopressurized energy remain uncertain, and drilling is
expensive. Scientists are developing new technology to
exploit the methane content in these reservoirs.
MAGMA. This molten or partially liquefied rock is
found from 10,000 to 33,000 feet below Earth’s surface.
Because magma is so hot, ranging from 1,650 to 2,200
Fahrenheit, it is a good geothermal resource. Extracting
energy from magma is still in the experimental stages.
Domestic Production of Geothermal Energy
In 2004 geothermal energy produced 14.4 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity, or 4% of the 358.8 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity produced by renewable
energy sources in the United States. (See Table 6.2.)
According to the International Geothermal Association,
at the end of 2003 the United States had 24% of the
installed geothermal generating capacity of the world
and the largest installed generating capacity of any single
country. However, most of the easily exploited geother-
mal reserves in the United States have already been
developed. Continued growth in the U.S. market depends
on the regulatory environment, oil price trends, who pays
for the new plants, and the success of new technologies to
exploit previously inaccessible reserves.
International Production of Geothermal Energy
According to the International Geothermal Associ-
ation, nearly 8,000 megawatts of geothermal electrical
generating capacity was present in more than twenty
countries in 2000. By 2004, according to John W. Lund
of the Geo-Heat Center at the Oregon Institute of Tech-
nology, the worldwide installed capacity of direct
geothermal utilization was 9,047 megawatts distributed
among thirty-eight countries.
This output is considered only a small fraction of the
overall potential: Many countries are believed to have in
excess of 100,000 megawatts of geothermal energy avail-
able. As with other fuel sources, however, world geother-
mal reserves are unevenly distributed. They occur mostly
in seismically active areas at the margins or borders of
the planet’s nine tectonic plates. Areas rich in geothermal
reserves include the west coasts of North and South
America, Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
Disadvantages of Geothermal Energy
Geothermal plants, which are not very efficient, must
be built near a geothermal source, so they are not acces-
sible to many consumers. They also produce unpleasant
odors when sulfur is released during processing and gen-
erate considerable noise. Environmental concerns have
been raised about potentially harmful pollutants, such as
ammonia, arsenic, boron, hydrogen sulfide, and radon,
that are often found in geothermal waters. Other concerns
are the collapse of the land from which the water is being
drained and water shortages from massive withdrawals.
WIND ENERGY
Winds are created by the uneven heating of the atmo-
sphere by the sun, the irregularities of Earth’s surface,
and the rotation of the planet. They are strongly influ-
enced by bodies of water, weather patterns, vegetation,
and other factors. When ‘‘harvested’’ by turbines, wind
can be used to generate electricity.
Early windmills produced mechanical energy to
pump water and grind grain in mills. By the late 1890s,
Americans had begun experimenting with wind power to
generate electricity. Their early efforts produced enough
electricity to light one or two modern light bulbs.
Beginning in the late twentieth century, industrial
and developing countries alike started using wind power
on a significant scale to complement existing power
sources and to bring electricity to remote regions. Wind
turbines cost less to install per unit of kilowatt capacity
than either coal or nuclear facilities. After installing a
windmill, there are few additional costs.

with gasoline to create gasohol, which is sold in three
blends: 10% gasohol, which is a mixture of 10% ethanol
and 90% gasoline; 7.7% gasohol, which is at least 7.7%
ethanol but less than 10%; and 5.7% gasohol, which is at
least 5.7% ethanol but less than 7.7%. The Federal High-
way Administration estimated that in 2003 Americans
used about 20.5 billion gallons of 10% gasohol, up from
16.3 billion gallons in 2000. In 2003 Americans used
slightly more than 12 billion gallons of less-than-10%
gasohol.
The use of ethanol is expected to increase. The
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL 109-58) required fuel
suppliers to nearly double their use of ethanol by 2012
to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign fuel
sources. Fuel distributors are also being required by
several major cities and more than twenty-five states to
remove the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or
MTBE, from gasoline. MTBE is known to contaminate
groundwater. Many suppliers are replacing the additive
with ethanol.
Automobiles can be built to run directly on ethanol or
on any mixture of gasoline and ethanol. However, etha-
nol is difficult and expensive to produce in bulk. Devel-
opment of this fuel source may depend more on the
political support of legislators from farming states and a
desire for energy independence than on savings at the gas
pump.
Some scientists have suggested that ethanol made
from refuse—for example, corncobs and rice hulls—
could liberate the alcohol fuel industry from its depen-
dence on food crops, such as corn and sugarcane, and
make the fuel cheaper. Worldwide enough corncobs and
rice hulls are left after crop production to produce more
than 40 billion gallons of ethanol. Other scientists argue
that wood-derived ethanol could eventually create a
sustainable liquid fuel industry. If new trees were planted
to replace those that were cut for fuel, they say, those
trees would not only be available for harvesting years
later but, in the meantime, would also alleviate global
warming by processing carbon dioxide. Other scientists
counter with the warning that an increased demand for
wood for transportation fuels might accelerate the
destruction of old-growth forests and endanger ecosys-
tems.
Another alternative fuel is ethanol-85 (E-85), which
is a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% unleaded gasoline. In
2006 there were approximately 1.5 million automobiles
on U.S. roads capable of using E-85 as a fuel. Such
vehicles are called ‘‘flex-fuel’’ vehicles because they
can run on E-85, gasohol, or gasoline.
Methanol (methyl alcohol) fuels have also been
tested successfully. Using methanol instead of diesel fuel
virtually eliminates sulfur emissions and reduces other
environmental pollutants usually emitted from trucks and
buses. Producing methanol is costly, however.
Burning biofuels in vehicle engines is part of the
‘‘carbon cycle,’’ in which vegetation makes use of the
products of automobile combustion. (See Figure 6.2.)
Automobile exhaust generated from fossil fuels, how-
ever, contains pollutants. In addition, generating exces-
sive amounts of carbon dioxide from either fossil fuels or
biofuels is thought to add to global warming because it
traps heat in the atmosphere.
Municipal Waste Recovery
Each year millions of tons of garbage are buried in
landfills and city dumps. This method of disposal is
becoming increasingly costly, and many landfills across
the nation are near capacity. Some communities discov-
ered that they could solve both problems—cost and capa-
city—by constructing waste-to-energy plants. Not only is
the garbage burned and reduced in volume by 90%,
energy in the form of steam or electricity is also gener-
ated in a cost-effective way.
Use of municipal waste as fuel has increased steadily
since the 1980s. According to the Annual Energy Review
2004, municipal waste (including landfill gas, sludge
waste, tires, and agricultural by-products) generated
22.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2004, up from
0.1 billion kilowatt-hours in 1982. (See Table 6.2.)
MASS BURN SYSTEMS. Most waste-to-energy plants in
the United States use the mass burn system (also called
direct combustion). Because the waste does not have to
be sorted or prepared before burning—except for remov-
ing obviously noncombustible, oversized objects—the
system eliminates expensive sorting, shredding, and
transportation machinery that may be prone to break
down. The waste is simply carried to the plant in trash
trucks and dropped into a storage pit. Overhead cranes
lift the garbage into a hopper that controls the amount of
waste that is fed into the furnace. The burning waste
produces heat, which is used to produce steam. The steam
can be used directly for industrial needs or can be sent
through a turbine to power a generator to produce elec-
tricity.
REFUSE-DERIVED FUEL SYSTEMS. At refuse-derived
fuel plants, waste is first processed to remove noncombus-
tible objects and to create homogeneous and uniformly
sized fuel. Large items such as bedsprings, dangerous
materials, and flammable liquids are removed by hand.
The trash is then shredded and screened to remove glass,
rocks, and other material that cannot be burned. The
remaining material is usually sifted a second time with an
air separator to yield fluff, which is placed in storage bins. It
can also be compressed into pellets or briquettes for long-
term storage. This fuel can be used by itself or with other
fuels, such as coal or wood.

PERFORMANCE OF WASTE-TO-ENERGY SYSTEMS. Most
waste-to-energy systems can produce two to four pounds of
steamforeverypoundofgarbageburned.A1,000-ton-per-day
mass burn system usually converts an average of 310,250 tons
of trash each year and recovers 2 trillion Btu of energy. In
addition, the plant will emit 96,000 tons of ash (32% of waste
input) for landfill disposal. A refuse-derived fuel plant
produces less ash but sends almost the same amount of waste
tothelandfillbecauseofthenoncombustiblesthatareremoved
from the trash before it is burned.
DISADVANTAGES OF WASTE-TO-ENERGY PLANTS. The
major problem with increasing the use of municipal waste-
to-energy plants is their effect on the environment. The
emission of particles into the air is partially controlled by
electrostatic precipitators, and many gases can be eliminated
by proper combustion techniques. However, large amounts
of dioxin (a dangerous air pollutant) and other toxins are
often emitted from these plants. Noise from trucks, fans,
and processing equipment can also be unpleasant for nearby
residents.
Landfill Gas Recovery
Landfills contain a large amount of biodegradable mat-
ter that is compacted and covered with soil. Methanogens,
which are anaerobic microorganisms, thrive in this oxygen-
depleted environment. They metabolize the biodegradable
matter in the landfill, producing methane gas and carbon
dioxide as by-products. In the past, as landfills aged, these
gases built up and leaked out, which prompted some com-
munities to drill holes in landfills and burn off the methane to
prevent dangerously large amounts from exploding.
The energy crisis of the 1970s made landfill methane
gas an energy resource too valuable to waste. The first
landfill gas recovery site was built in 1975 at the Palos
Verdes Landfill in Rolling Hills Estates, California. By
December 2005, according to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA), 395 landfill gas energy sites were
operating in the United States and another 600 landfill
sites had been identified for potential development (http://
www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/index.htm). The EPA estimated

that landfill gas generated about 9 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity per year.
In a typical operation, garbage is allowed to decompose
for several months. When a sufficient amount of methane
gas has developed, it is piped to a generating plant, where it
is used to create electricity. In its purest form, methane gas
can be used like natural gas. Depending on the extraction
rates, most sites can produce gas for about twenty years.
Besides the energy provided, tapping the methane reduces
landfill odors and the chances of explosions.
HYDROPOWER
In the past, flowing water turned waterwheels of
mills to grind grain; today hydropower plants convert
the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy,
turning turbines to create electricity. Hydropower is the
most widely used renewable energy source in the world.
In the United States it provided 75% of all electricity
produced from renewable sources in 2004. (See Table
6.2.)
Advantages and Disadvantages of Hydropower
Today hydropower is the only means of storing large
quantities of energy for almost instant use. Water is held
in a large reservoir behind a dam, with a hydroelectric
power plant below. The dam creates a height from which
water can flow at a fast rate. When it reaches the power
plant, it pushes the turbine blades attached to the elec-
trical generator. Whenever power is needed, the valves
are opened, the moving water spins the turbines, and the
generator quickly produces electricity.
Nearly all the best sites for large hydropower plants
are being used in the United States. Small hydropower
plants are expensive to build but may eventually become
economical because of their low operating costs. One of
the disadvantages of small hydropower generators is their
reliance on rain and melting snow to fill reservoirs;
drought conditions can affect the water supply. Addition-
ally, environmental groups strongly protest the construc-
tion of new dams, pointing to ruined streams, dried up
waterfalls, and altered aquatic habitats.
The Future of Hydropower
The last federally funded hydropower dam, com-
pleted by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1986, was the
Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake on the Savannah River,
which forms the border between South Carolina and Geor-
gia. Since then, local governments have been required to
contribute half the cost of any new dam proposed in the
United States. While expansion and efficiency improve-
ments at existing dams offer significant potential for addi-
tional energy, hydropower’s future contribution to U.S.
energy generation should remain relatively constant.
Additional supplies of hydroelectric power for the United
States will likely come from Canada.
Most of the new development in hydropower is
occurring in developing nations, which see it as an effec-
tive method of supplying power to growing populations.
These massive public-works projects usually require
huge amounts of money—most of it borrowed from the
developed world. Hydroelectric dams are considered
worth the cost and potential environmental threats
because they bring cheap electric power to the citizenry.
In May 2006 the Chinese government announced that
construction was completed on the world’s largest dam,
the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in
Hubei province, China (http://english.gov.cn/2006-05/
20/content_286525.htm). Five times the size of the Hoover

Dam in the United States, the dam is 185 meters (607 feet)
tall and 2,309 meters (7,575 feet, or 1.4 miles) in length. It
is scheduled to begin generating power in 2009, after its
twenty-six generators have been installed and water has
filled the giant reservoir. Once operational, the dam is
expected to produce 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electri-
city per year.
GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
Although bubbling hot springs became public baths
as early as ancient Rome, using hot water and under-
ground steam to produce power is a relatively recent
development. Electricity was first generated from natural
steam in Italy in 1904. The world’s first natural steam
power plant was built in 1958 in a volcanic region of
New Zealand. A field of twenty-eight geothermal power
plants covering thirty square miles in northern California
was completed in 1960.
What Is Geothermal Energy?
Geothermal energy is the natural, internal heat of
Earth trapped in rock formations deep underground. Only
a fraction of it can be extracted, usually through large
fractures in Earth’s crust. Hot springs, geysers, and
fumaroles (holes in or near volcanoes from which vapor
escapes) are the most easily exploitable sources. (See
Figure 6.3.) Geothermal reservoirs provide hot water or
steam that can be used for heating buildings and proces-
sing food. Pressurized hot water or steam can also be
directed toward turbines, which spin, generating electri-
city for residential and commercial customers.
Types of Geothermal Energy
Like most natural energy sources, geothermal energy
is usable only when it is concentrated in one spot—in
this case, in what is known as a ‘‘thermal reservoir.’’
There are four types of reservoirs, including hydrothermal

reservoirs, dry rock reservoirs, geopressurized reservoirs,
and magma. Most of the known reservoirs for geothermal
power in the United States are located west of the Missis-
sippi River, and the highest-temperature geothermal
resources occur for the most part west of the Rocky Moun-
tains.
HYDROTHERMAL RESERVOIRS. Hydrothermal reser-
voirs are underground pools of hot water covered by a
permeable formation through which steam escapes under
pressure. Once at the surface the steam is purified and
piped directly to the electrical generating station. These
systems are the cheapest and simplest form of geothermal
energy. The Geysers thermal field, ninety miles north of
San Francisco, California, is the world’s largest source of
geothermal power. According to the Web site of Calpine
Corporation, which operates nineteen of the twenty-one
power generating plants at the site, as of 2006 The
Geysers generated enough electricity to satisfy the power
needs of a city the size of San Francisco and provided
nearly 60% of the electricity used in the region extending
northward from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon
border (http://www.geysers.com/).
DRY ROCK. These formations are the most common
geothermal sources, especially in the West. However,
reservoirs of this type are typically more than 6,000 feet
below the surface, which poses numerous difficulties. To
tap them, water is injected into hot rock formations that
have been fractured, and the resulting steam or water is
collected. Hot dry rock technologies were developed and
tested at New Mexico’s Fenton Hill plant, which operated
between 1970 and 1996.
GEOPRESSURIZED RESERVOIRS. These sedimentary
formations contain hot water and methane gas. Supplies
of geopressurized energy remain uncertain, and drilling is
expensive. Scientists are developing new technology to
exploit the methane content in these reservoirs.
MAGMA. This molten or partially liquefied rock is
found from 10,000 to 33,000 feet below Earth’s surface.
Because magma is so hot, ranging from 1,650 to 2,200
Fahrenheit, it is a good geothermal resource. Extracting
energy from magma is still in the experimental stages.
Domestic Production of Geothermal Energy
In 2004 geothermal energy produced 14.4 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity, or 4% of the 358.8 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity produced by renewable
energy sources in the United States. (See Table 6.2.)
According to the International Geothermal Association,
at the end of 2003 the United States had 24% of the
installed geothermal generating capacity of the world
and the largest installed generating capacity of any single
country. However, most of the easily exploited geother-
mal reserves in the United States have already been
developed. Continued growth in the U.S. market depends
on the regulatory environment, oil price trends, who pays
for the new plants, and the success of new technologies to
exploit previously inaccessible reserves.
International Production of Geothermal Energy
According to the International Geothermal Associ-
ation, nearly 8,000 megawatts of geothermal electrical
generating capacity was present in more than twenty
countries in 2000. By 2004, according to John W. Lund
of the Geo-Heat Center at the Oregon Institute of Tech-
nology, the worldwide installed capacity of direct
geothermal utilization was 9,047 megawatts distributed
among thirty-eight countries.
This output is considered only a small fraction of the
overall potential: Many countries are believed to have in
excess of 100,000 megawatts of geothermal energy avail-
able. As with other fuel sources, however, world geother-
mal reserves are unevenly distributed. They occur mostly
in seismically active areas at the margins or borders of
the planet’s nine tectonic plates. Areas rich in geothermal
reserves include the west coasts of North and South
America, Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
Disadvantages of Geothermal Energy
Geothermal plants, which are not very efficient, must
be built near a geothermal source, so they are not acces-
sible to many consumers. They also produce unpleasant
odors when sulfur is released during processing and gen-
erate considerable noise. Environmental concerns have
been raised about potentially harmful pollutants, such as
ammonia, arsenic, boron, hydrogen sulfide, and radon,
that are often found in geothermal waters. Other concerns
are the collapse of the land from which the water is being
drained and water shortages from massive withdrawals.
WIND ENERGY
Winds are created by the uneven heating of the atmo-
sphere by the sun, the irregularities of Earth’s surface,
and the rotation of the planet. They are strongly influ-
enced by bodies of water, weather patterns, vegetation,
and other factors. When ‘‘harvested’’ by turbines, wind
can be used to generate electricity.
Early windmills produced mechanical energy to
pump water and grind grain in mills. By the late 1890s,
Americans had begun experimenting with wind power to
generate electricity. Their early efforts produced enough
electricity to light one or two modern light bulbs.
Beginning in the late twentieth century, industrial

than either coal or nuclear facilities. After installing a

Compared with the pinwheel-shaped farm windmills
that still dot rural America, today’s state-of-the-art wind
turbines look more like airplane propellers. Their sleek
fiberglass design allows them to generate an abundance
of mechanical energy, which can be converted to electri-
city.
The most favorable locations for wind turbines are in
mountain passes and along coastlines, where wind speeds
are generally highest and most consistent. Of all the
places in the world, Europe has the greatest coastal wind
resources.
Western
Europe
and
the
United
States
accounted for nearly 90% of all new wind energy instal-
lations in 2003 (International Energy Outlook 2005,
Energy Information Administration, 2005). As of 2004,
electricity-producing wind turbines operated in ninety-
five countries.
Domestic Energy Production by Wind Turbines
The U.S. wind energy industry began in California in
1981 with the installation of 144 relatively small turbines
with a combined capacity of 7 megawatts of electricity.
Within a year the number of turbines had increased ten
times and by 1986 a hundred times.
During 1998 and 1999, wind farm activity expanded
into other states, motivated by financial incentives (such as
tax credits for wind energy production), regulatory incen-
tives, and state mandates (in Iowa and Minnesota). In 1999
Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas added capacity exceeding 100
megawatts each. In 2003 the total installed generating
capacity of the United States was 6,374 megawatts, and
wind power plants operated in thirty-two states. (See Figure
6.4.) By 2004, according to the American Wind Energy
Association, twelve states—California, Colorado, Iowa,

In Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (2006), the Energy
Information Administration projected that wind power
capacity in the United States would triple from 2004 to
2030. Refinements in wind-turbine technology would
drive some of the increase. Government encouragement
would also be important, however. Wind Powering

U.S. Department of Energy, sought to have 80,000 mega-
watts of generation capacity in place by 2020 and to have
wind power provide 5% of the nation’s electricity. In
addition,
the

Program,
announced in 2005 by the Bureau of Land Management
(part of the Department of the Interior), focused on
development of wind energy on public lands in eleven
western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washing-
ton, and Wyoming (http://windeis.anl.gov/documents/

International Development of Wind Energy
During the decade following the 1973 oil embargo,
more than 10,000 wind machines were installed world-
wide, ranging in size from portable units to multimega-
watt turbines. In China, for example, small wind turbines
allow people to watch their favorite television shows, an
activity that has increased wind energy demand. In fact,
in 2001 China was the world’s largest manufacturer of
small wind turbines.
According to the Global Wind Energy Council, global
wind-power-generating capacity was 47,000 megawatts
in 2004, up from 3,531 megawatts in 1994 (http://www.
gwec.net/fileadmin/documents/GWEC_Brochure.pdf).
Europe accounted for 72% of the global wind power in
2004. The World Wind Energy Association projected in
2004 that global wind-power capacity would top 100,000
megawatts by 2008.
Interest in wind energy has been driven, in part, by the
declining cost of capturing wind energy. For new turbines
at sites with strong winds, prices declined from more than
$0.38 per kilowatt-hour in 1980 to about $0.04 per
kilowatt-hour in 2002 (Lester R. Brown, ‘‘Wind Power
Set to Become World’s Leading Energy Source,’’ Earth
Policy Institute, 2003). Decreasing costs could make wind
power competitive with gas and coal power plants, even
before considering wind’s environmental advantages.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Energy
The main problem with wind energy is that the wind
does not always blow. In addition, some people find the
whirring noise of wind turbines annoying and object to
clusters of wind turbines in mountain passes and along
shorelines, where they interfere with scenic views. Envir-
onmentalists also point out that wind turbines are respon-
sible for the loss of thousands of endangered birds that
inadvertently fly into the blades. Birds frequently use
windy passages in their travel patterns. However, wind
farms do not emit climate-altering carbon dioxide and
other pollutants, respiratory irritants, or radioactive waste.
Because wind farms do not require water to operate, they
are especially well suited to semiarid and arid regions.
SOLAR ENERGY
Solar energy, which comes from the sun, is a renew-
able, widely available energy source that does not gen-
erate huge amounts of pollution or radioactive waste.
Solar-powered cars have competed in long-distance
races, and solar energy has been used for many years to
power spacecraft. Although many people consider solar
energy a product of the space age, architectural research-
ers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built the
first solar-heated house in 1939.
Solar radiation is nearly constant outside Earth’s atmo-
sphere, but the amount of solar energy reaching any point on
Earth varies with changing atmospheric conditions, such as
clouds and dust, and the changing position of Earth relative
to the sun. In the United States, exposure to the sun’s rays is
greatest in the Southwest, although almost all regions have
some solar resources. (See Figure 6.5.)
Passive and Active Solar Systems
Passive solar energy systems, such as greenhouses or
windows with a southern exposure, use heat flow, eva-
poration, or other natural processes to collect and transfer
heat. (See Figure 6.6.) They are considered the least
costly and least difficult solar systems to implement.
Active solar systems require collectors and storage
devices as well as motors, pumps, and valves to operate
the systems that transfer heat. (See Figure 6.6.) Collectors
consist of an absorbing plate that transfers the sun’s heat
to a working fluid (liquid or gas), a translucent cover
plate that prevents the heat from radiating back into the
atmosphere, and insulation on the back of the collector
panel to further reduce heat loss. Excess solar energy is
transferred to a storage facility so it may provide power
on cloudy days.
In both passive and active systems, the conversion of
solar energy into a form of power is made at the site
where it is used. The most common and least expensive
active solar systems are used for heating water.
Solar Thermal Energy Systems
In a solar thermal energy system, mirrors or lenses
constantly track the sun’s position and focus its rays onto
solar receivers that contain water or other fluids. The
90
Renewable Energy
Energy

fluid is heated to more than 750 Fahrenheit; that heat is
used to power an electric generator. In a distributed solar
thermal system, the collected energy powers irrigation
pumps, provides electricity for small communities, or
captures normally wasted heat from the sun in industrial
areas. In a central solar thermal system, the energy is
collected at a central location and used by utility net-
works for a large number of customers.
Other systems include solar ponds and trough sys-
tems. Solar ponds are pools filled with water and salt.
Because saltwater is denser than freshwater, the saltwater
on the bottom absorbs the heat, which is trapped by the
freshwater on top. Trough systems use U-shaped mirrors
to concentrate the sunshine on water or on oil-filled tubes.
Photovoltaic Conversion Systems
The
photovoltaic
cell
system
converts
sunlight
directly into electricity without the use of mechanical
generators. Photovoltaic cells have no moving parts, are
easy to install, require little maintenance, and can last up
FIGURE 6.5

to twenty years. The cells are commonly used to power
small devices, such as watches or calculators. On a larger
scale they provide electricity for rural households, recrea-
tional vehicles, and businesses. Solar panels using photo-
voltaic cells have generated electricity for space stations
and satellites for many years.
The cells produce the most power around noon, when
sunlight is the most intense. They are usually connected
to storage batteries that provide electricity during cloudy
days and at night. A backup energy supply is usually
required.
The use of photovoltaic cells is expanding around the
world. Because they contain no turbines or other moving
parts, operating costs are low, and maintenance is mini-
mal. Above all, the fuel source (sunshine) is free and
plentiful. The main disadvantage of photovoltaic cell
systems is the high initial cost, although prices have
fallen considerably. While toxic materials are often used
in the construction of the cells, researchers are investigat-
ing new materials, recycling, and disposal.
Solar Energy Usage
Use of solar energy is difficult to measure because it
is rarely connected to any kind of metered grid. However,
shipments of solar equipment can be used as an indicator
of use. According to the Annual Energy Review 2004,
total shipments of solar thermal collectors peaked in 1981
at more than 21 million square feet, fell to 6.6 million
square feet in 1991, and rose again to more than 11
million square feet in 2001 through 2003. (See Figure
6.7.) In 2003 most solar thermal collectors were sold for
residential purposes in Sunbelt states, usually to heat
water for swimming pools. (See Figure 6.8 and Figure
6.9.) The market for solar energy space heating has
virtually disappeared. Only a small proportion of solar
thermal collectors are used for commercial purposes,
although some state and municipal power companies
have solar energy systems they can use for additional
power during peak hours.
Solar Power as an International Rural Solution
Getting electricity to rural areas has long been more
expensive than serving cities. In the United States most
farmers did not receive electrical power until 1935, when
the Rural Electrification Administration provided low-
cost financing to rural electric cooperatives. In places
such as western China, the Himalayan foothills, and the
Amazon basin today, the cost of connecting new rural
customers to electricity grids remains very high.
While rural families may not have access to electrical
grid systems, they do have sunlight: In most tropical
countries, considerable sunlight falls on rooftops. Photo-
voltaic cells can be installed on them to run water pumps,
lights, refrigerators, and communications equipment.
Electricity produced by photovoltaic cells was initially
too expensive—as much as a thousand times more than

electricity produced by conventional power plants—but
prices have continually fallen, making solar energy a
competitive choice in some areas.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Solar Energy
The primary advantage of solar energy is its inexhaus-
tible supply. It is especially useful in rural or remote areas
that cannot be easily connected to an electrical power grid.
Although solar power still costs more than three times as
much as fossil fuel energy, utilities often turn to solar
energy to provide ‘‘peaking power’’ on extremely hot or
cold days. Building solar energy systems to provide peak
power capacity is often cheaper than building the backup
diesel generators that are often used.
Solar power’s primary disadvantage is its reliance on
a consistently sunny climate, which is possible in limited
areas. It also requires a large amount of land for the most
efficient collection of solar energy by electricity plants.
POWER FROM THE OCEAN
Oceans are not as easily controlled as rivers or water
directed through canals into turbines, so unlocking their
potential power is far more challenging. Three ideas
undergoing experimentation are tidal plants, wave power,
and ocean thermal energy conversion.
Tidal Power
Tidal plants use the movement of water as it ebbs and
flows to generate power. A minimum tidal range of three
to five yards is generally considered necessary for an
economically feasible plant. (The tidal range is the dif-
ference in height between consecutive high and low tides.)
The largest existing tidal facility is the 240-megawatt
plant at the La Rance estuary in northern France, built in
1965. Canada built a smaller 40-megawatt unit at the Bay
of Fundy, which has a fifteen-yard tidal range, the largest
in the world. A larger plant for that site is under consid-
eration. Russia has a small 400-kilowatt plant near Mur-
mansk, close to the Barents Sea. The world’s first offshore
tidal turbine, in the ocean about a mile from Devon,
England, began producing energy in 2003.
Wave Energy
One type of wave power plant is the oscillating water
column; the first significant examples were built at Tof-
testallen, on Norway’s Atlantic coast. In this system, the
arrival of a wave forces water up a hollow 65-foot tower,
displacing the air in the tower. The air rushes out the top
through a turbine, whose rotors spin, generating electri-
city. When the wave falls back and the water level falls,
air is sucked back in through the turbine, again generat-
ing electricity. Similar systems have been tested in China,
India, Japan, Portugal, and Scotland.
A second type of wave power plant uses the overflow
of high ocean waves. As the waves splash against the top
of a dam, some of the water goes over and is trapped in a
reservoir on the other side. The water is then directed
through a turbine as it flows back to the sea.

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
Ocean thermal energy conversion uses the temperature
difference between warm surface water and the cooler
water in the ocean’s depths to produce heat energy, which
can power a heat engine to produce electricity. The systems
can be installed on ships, barges, or offshore platforms with
underwater cables that transmit electricity to shore.
HYDROGEN: A FUEL OF THE FUTURE?
Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant chemical ele-
ment, is the ideal fuel from the environmental point of view.
Its combustion produces only water vapor, and it is entirely
carbon free. Three-quarters of the mass of the universe is
hydrogen, so in theory the supply is ample. However, the
combustible form of hydrogen is a gas and is not found in
nature. The many compounds containing hydrogen—water,
for example—cannot be converted into pure hydrogen with-
out the expenditure of considerable energy. Usually, the
amount of energy required to make hydrogen gas is equal
to the amount of energy obtained by the combustion of that
gas. Therefore, with today’s technology, little or nothing
could be gained from an energy point of view.
Hydrogen fuel cells are similar to batteries, but they
use hydrogen as a fuel. They can be used to produce
electricity and heat and to power cars. Their development
is also in experimental stages.
Research into the use of hydrogen as a fuel got a
boost when President George W. Bush announced a
hydrogen fuel initiative in his 2003 State of the Union
Address. Congress appropriated $159 million for hydro-
gen and fuel cell research and development in fiscal year
2004; $223 million in fiscal year 2005; and $243 million
in fiscal year 2006. Goals of the initiative include redu-
cing the cost of hydrogen fuel to make it comparable to
gasoline, resolving issues for safe in-vehicle storage of
reserve fuel, and lowering the cost of hydrogen power
systems to compete with internal combustion engines.
Researchers project that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles could
reduce U.S. demand for oil by about eleven million
barrels per day—the amount the United States now
imports’’—by
2040
(http://www1.eere.energy.gov/
hydrogenandfuelcells/presidents_initiative.html).
FUTURE TRENDS IN U.S. RENEWABLE
ENERGY USE
In its Annual Energy Outlook 2006, the Energy
Information Administration forecasted that total renew-
able fuel consumption, including ethanol for transpor-
tation, would increase from 6 quadrillion Btu in 2004
to 9.6 quadrillion Btu in 2030. About 60% of the
projected demand would be for electricity generation.
Renewable fuel is expected to remain a small contri-
butor to overall electricity generation, rising slightly
from 9% of the total generation in 2004 to 9.4% in
2030.
Hydropower is expected to remain the largest source
of renewable electricity generation through 2030, but its
share of total generation will fall from 6.8% in 2004 to
5.1% in 2030. The production of other renewables should
increase steadily. (See Figure 6.10.) The largest source of
renewable generation after hydropower is biomass, which
is projected to more than double from 2004 to 2030. (See
Figure 6.11.) The agency projected that wind power
would increase from 0.4% of total generation in 2004 to
1.1% in 2030 and that high-output geothermal capacity
would increase from 0.4% of total generation in 2004 to
0.9% in 2030.
Energy production from municipal solid waste and
landfill gas is expected to stay static from 2004 to 2030,
remaining at 0.5% of total generation. Solar energy is not
expected to contribute much to the total of centrally
generated electricity.

CHAPTER 7
ENERGY RESERVES—OIL, GAS, COAL, AND URANIUM
Congress requires the Department of Energy to pre-
pare estimates of the quantities of crude oil, natural gas,
coal, and uranium that exist in the earth and can be used
as fuel. These estimates, which include deposits in the
United States and other parts of the world, are considered
essential to the development, implementation, and eva-
luation of national energy policies. The estimates are also
important because these resources are nonrenewable,
which means they can be used up: They are formed much
more slowly than it takes to consume them.
The focus of the estimates is recoverable reserves.
‘‘Proved reserves’’ are deposits of fuel in known loca-
tions that, based on the geological and engineering data,
can be recovered using existing technology. Drilling
or mining for these fuels also makes sense, given cur-
rent economic conditions. Undiscovered recoverable
resources, by contrast, are quantities of fuel that are
thought to exist in favorable geologic settings. It would
be feasible to retrieve these resources using existing
technology, although it might not be feasible under cur-
rent economic conditions.
CRUDE OIL
U.S. proved reserves of crude oil declined from 1994
through 1996, rose and then fell in 1997 and 1998,
climbed through 2002, then fell again in 2003 and
2004. On December 31, 2004, crude oil reserves totaled
21.4 billion barrels—near the 1998 reserves level (U.S.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids
Reserves
2004
Annual
Report,
Energy
Information
Administration, 2005). Together, Texas, Alaska, Califor-
nia, and offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico accounted
for 77% of U.S. proved reserves in December 2004. (See
Figure 7.1.) Of the four regions, only Texas reported an
increase in proved reserves in 2004.
Proved reserves of crude oil rose in 1970 with the
inclusion of Alaska’s North Slope oil fields. As the oil
has been extracted, reserves have steadily declined. In
1987 Alaska’s proved reserves totaled 13.2 billion barrels
of crude oil; by 2004 the state had only 4.3 billion
barrels. (See Figure 7.1.) Proved reserves of crude oil fell
by 119 million barrels in Alaska from 2003 through 2004.
The Gulf of Mexico federal offshore areas had about
4.1 billion barrels of proved reserves in 2004, down 410
million barrels from 2003. (See Figure 7.1.) Hurricane
Ivan in September 2004 damaged some of the oil drilling
platforms in the ocean, so a portion of the reserves
became at least temporarily unrecoverable.
In 1996 scientists turned their attention to the dry lands
of the Permian basin in western Texas and southeastern
New Mexico. They found plenty of potential for crude oil;
in fact, it became one of the most active onshore areas for
new exploration. In 2004 Texas had about 4.6 billion bar-
rels of crude oil proved reserves, up 30 million barrels from
2003. Proved reserves in New Mexico, however, dropped
by 8 million barrels from 2003 through 2004.
NATURAL GAS
Figure 7.2 shows the distribution of U.S. proved
reserves of dry natural gas in 2004, which totaled 192.5
trillion cubic feet, an increase of 3.5 billion cubic feet
from 2003. The United States also had 201.2 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas liquid proved reserves, a 2%
increase from the volume reported in 2003 in the lower
48 states and a 1% increase in Alaska.
UNDISCOVERED OIL AND GAS RESOURCES
Other resources are believed to exist based on past
geological experience, although they are not yet proved.
The Energy Information Administration estimates that
105 billion barrels of crude oil, 682 trillion cubic feet
of dry natural gas, and 8 billion barrels of natural gas
liquids remain undiscovered in the United States.

Looking for Oil and Gas
Finding oil and gas usually takes two steps. First,
geological and geophysical exploration identifies areas
where oil and gas are most likely to be found. Much of
this exploration is seismic, using shock waves to deter-
mine the formations below the surface of the earth. Dif-
ferent rock formations transmit shock waves at different
velocities, so they help determine if the geological fea-
tures most often associated with oil and gas accumula-
tions are present. After the seismic testing has been
completed—and if it has been successful—exploratory
wells are drilled to determine if oil or gas is present.
Drilling activity has declined dramatically since 1981,
when 91,553 exploratory wells were drilled. (See Table 7.1.)
Nearly 70% of them found oil and gas deposits. In 2004 only
34,925 were attempted, but 87.5% were successful. In 1981
oil companies had 3,970 rotary rigs in operation; by 2004
only 1,192 were operating. (See Figure 7.3.) Of this number,
according to the Energy Information Administration, 165
rigs drilled for oil and 1,025 drilled for natural gas. There
were 1,095 onshore rigs and 97 offshore rigs. The average
depth of exploratory and development wells has steadily
increased, from 3,635 feet in 1949 to 5,770 feet in 2004.
Gas wells (averaging 6,045 feet in 2004) are typically deeper
than oil wells (averaging 5,249 feet in 2004).
The Cost to Drill
In 2003 the average cost of drilling oil and gas wells
was about $1,131,700 in real dollars—that is, adjusted for
inflation—or $204 per foot. (See Table 7.2.) Historically,
it has cost more to drill a gas well than an oil well
because gas wells are deeper. In 2003, however, the cost
of drilling an average gas well ($1,106,000) was not

much higher than the cost of drilling an oil well
($1,037,300) because the average cost per foot of drilling
an oil well (about $221) was higher than that of drilling a
foot of gas well (about $190). Although drilling costs have
fluctuated in recent years, it costs considerably more to
drill a well today than it did in the 1960s and 1970s, not
only because of inflation but also because all wells must
now be drilled deeper.
The estimated expenditures on exploration for, and
development of, oil and gas fields around the world by
major U.S. companies peaked at $76.8 billion in 2000, a
huge increase from each of the fifteen previous years. In
1984 the companies spent $65.3 billion, another high
point. (See Table 7.3.) In 2003 U.S. energy companies
spent $55.4 billion on oil and gas exploration around the
world, with about half of that, $27.2 billion, spent for
exploration in the United States.
Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Controversy has developed over opening part of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil explora-
tion. Oil fields in Prudhoe Bay, directly west of the
refuge, supply about 60% of Alaska’s oil and 20% of
the country’s domestic oil, although production is drop-
ping steadily as the oil is extracted. In 1980 Congress
passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation
Act (PL 96-487), which set aside more than 104 million
acres for parks and wilderness areas, including 19 million
acres for the wildlife refuge. The conservation act did
not, however, include the coastal plain.

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
Ocean thermal energy conversion uses the temperature
difference between warm surface water and the cooler
water in the ocean’s depths to produce heat energy, which
can power a heat engine to produce electricity. The systems
can be installed on ships, barges, or offshore platforms with
underwater cables that transmit electricity to shore.
HYDROGEN: A FUEL OF THE FUTURE?
Hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant chemical ele-
ment, is the ideal fuel from the environmental point of view.
Its combustion produces only water vapor, and it is entirely
carbon free. Three-quarters of the mass of the universe is
hydrogen, so in theory the supply is ample. However, the
combustible form of hydrogen is a gas and is not found in
nature. The many compounds containing hydrogen—water,
for example—cannot be converted into pure hydrogen with-
out the expenditure of considerable energy. Usually, the
amount of energy required to make hydrogen gas is equal
to the amount of energy obtained by the combustion of that
gas. Therefore, with today’s technology, little or nothing
could be gained from an energy point of view.
Hydrogen fuel cells are similar to batteries, but they
use hydrogen as a fuel. They can be used to produce
electricity and heat and to power cars. Their development
is also in experimental stages.
Research into the use of hydrogen as a fuel got a
boost when President George W. Bush announced a
hydrogen fuel initiative in his 2003 State of the Union
Address. Congress appropriated $159 million for hydro-
gen and fuel cell research and development in fiscal year
2004; $223 million in fiscal year 2005; and $243 million
in fiscal year 2006. Goals of the initiative include redu-
cing the cost of hydrogen fuel to make it comparable to
gasoline, resolving issues for safe in-vehicle storage of
reserve fuel, and lowering the cost of hydrogen power
systems to compete with internal combustion engines.
Researchers project that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles could
reduce U.S. demand for oil by about eleven million
barrels per day—the amount the United States now
imports’’—by
2040
(http://www1.eere.energy.gov/
hydrogenandfuelcells/presidents_initiative.html).
FUTURE TRENDS IN U.S. RENEWABLE
ENERGY USE
In its Annual Energy Outlook 2006, the Energy
Information Administration forecasted that total renew-
able fuel consumption, including ethanol for transpor-
tation, would increase from 6 quadrillion Btu in 2004
to 9.6 quadrillion Btu in 2030. About 60% of the
projected demand would be for electricity generation.
Renewable fuel is expected to remain a small contri-
butor to overall electricity generation, rising slightly
from 9% of the total generation in 2004 to 9.4% in
2030.
Hydropower is expected to remain the largest source
of renewable electricity generation through 2030, but its
share of total generation will fall from 6.8% in 2004 to
5.1% in 2030. The production of other renewables should
increase steadily. (See Figure 6.10.) The largest source of
renewable generation after hydropower is biomass, which
is projected to more than double from 2004 to 2030. (See
Figure 6.11.) The agency projected that wind power
would increase from 0.4% of total generation in 2004 to
1.1% in 2030 and that high-output geothermal capacity
would increase from 0.4% of total generation in 2004 to
0.9% in 2030.
Energy production from municipal solid waste and
landfill gas is expected to stay static from 2004 to 2030,
remaining at 0.5% of total generation. Solar energy is not
expected to contribute much to the total of centrally
generated electricity.

CHAPTER 7
ENERGY RESERVES—OIL, GAS, COAL, AND URANIUM
Congress requires the Department of Energy to pre-
pare estimates of the quantities of crude oil, natural gas,
coal, and uranium that exist in the earth and can be used
as fuel. These estimates, which include deposits in the
United States and other parts of the world, are considered
essential to the development, implementation, and eva-
luation of national energy policies. The estimates are also
important because these resources are nonrenewable,
which means they can be used up: They are formed much
more slowly than it takes to consume them.
The focus of the estimates is recoverable reserves.
‘‘Proved reserves’’ are deposits of fuel in known loca-
tions that, based on the geological and engineering data,
can be recovered using existing technology. Drilling
or mining for these fuels also makes sense, given cur-
rent economic conditions. Undiscovered recoverable
resources, by contrast, are quantities of fuel that are
thought to exist in favorable geologic settings. It would
be feasible to retrieve these resources using existing
technology, although it might not be feasible under cur-
rent economic conditions.
CRUDE OIL
U.S. proved reserves of crude oil declined from 1994
through 1996, rose and then fell in 1997 and 1998,
climbed through 2002, then fell again in 2003 and
2004. On December 31, 2004, crude oil reserves totaled
21.4 billion barrels—near the 1998 reserves level (U.S.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids
Reserves
2004
Annual
Report,
Energy
Information
Administration, 2005). Together, Texas, Alaska, Califor-
nia, and offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico accounted
for 77% of U.S. proved reserves in December 2004. (See
Figure 7.1.) Of the four regions, only Texas reported an
increase in proved reserves in 2004.
Proved reserves of crude oil rose in 1970 with the
inclusion of Alaska’s North Slope oil fields. As the oil
has been extracted, reserves have steadily declined. In
1987 Alaska’s proved reserves totaled 13.2 billion barrels
of crude oil; by 2004 the state had only 4.3 billion
barrels. (See Figure 7.1.) Proved reserves of crude oil fell
by 119 million barrels in Alaska from 2003 through 2004.
The Gulf of Mexico federal offshore areas had about
4.1 billion barrels of proved reserves in 2004, down 410
million barrels from 2003. (See Figure 7.1.) Hurricane
Ivan in September 2004 damaged some of the oil drilling
platforms in the ocean, so a portion of the reserves
became at least temporarily unrecoverable.
In 1996 scientists turned their attention to the dry lands
of the Permian basin in western Texas and southeastern
New Mexico. They found plenty of potential for crude oil;
in fact, it became one of the most active onshore areas for
new exploration. In 2004 Texas had about 4.6 billion bar-
rels of crude oil proved reserves, up 30 million barrels from
2003. Proved reserves in New Mexico, however, dropped
by 8 million barrels from 2003 through 2004.
NATURAL GAS
Figure 7.2 shows the distribution of U.S. proved
reserves of dry natural gas in 2004, which totaled 192.5
trillion cubic feet, an increase of 3.5 billion cubic feet
from 2003. The United States also had 201.2 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas liquid proved reserves, a 2%
increase from the volume reported in 2003 in the lower
48 states and a 1% increase in Alaska.
UNDISCOVERED OIL AND GAS RESOURCES
Other resources are believed to exist based on past
geological experience, although they are not yet proved.
The Energy Information Administration estimates that
105 billion barrels of crude oil, 682 trillion cubic feet
of dry natural gas, and 8 billion barrels of natural gas
liquids remain undiscovered in the United States.

Looking for Oil and Gas
Finding oil and gas usually takes two steps. First,
geological and geophysical exploration identifies areas
where oil and gas are most likely to be found. Much of
this exploration is seismic, using shock waves to deter-
mine the formations below the surface of the earth. Dif-
ferent rock formations transmit shock waves at different
velocities, so they help determine if the geological fea-
tures most often associated with oil and gas accumula-
tions are present. After the seismic testing has been
completed—and if it has been successful—exploratory
wells are drilled to determine if oil or gas is present.
Drilling activity has declined dramatically since 1981,
when 91,553 exploratory wells were drilled. (See Table 7.1.)
Nearly 70% of them found oil and gas deposits. In 2004 only
34,925 were attempted, but 87.5% were successful. In 1981
oil companies had 3,970 rotary rigs in operation; by 2004
only 1,192 were operating. (See Figure 7.3.) Of this number,
according to the Energy Information Administration, 165
rigs drilled for oil and 1,025 drilled for natural gas. There
were 1,095 onshore rigs and 97 offshore rigs. The average
depth of exploratory and development wells has steadily
increased, from 3,635 feet in 1949 to 5,770 feet in 2004.
Gas wells (averaging 6,045 feet in 2004) are typically deeper
than oil wells (averaging 5,249 feet in 2004).
The Cost to Drill
In 2003 the average cost of drilling oil and gas wells
was about $1,131,700 in real dollars—that is, adjusted for
inflation—or $204 per foot. (See Table 7.2.) Historically,
it has cost more to drill a gas well than an oil well
because gas wells are deeper. In 2003, however, the cost
of drilling an average gas well ($1,106,000) was not

much higher than the cost of drilling an oil well
($1,037,300) because the average cost per foot of drilling
an oil well (about $221) was higher than that of drilling a
foot of gas well (about $190). Although drilling costs have
fluctuated in recent years, it costs considerably more to
drill a well today than it did in the 1960s and 1970s, not
only because of inflation but also because all wells must
now be drilled deeper.
The estimated expenditures on exploration for, and
development of, oil and gas fields around the world by
major U.S. companies peaked at $76.8 billion in 2000, a
huge increase from each of the fifteen previous years. In
1984 the companies spent $65.3 billion, another high
point. (See Table 7.3.) In 2003 U.S. energy companies
spent $55.4 billion on oil and gas exploration around the
world, with about half of that, $27.2 billion, spent for
exploration in the United States.
Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Controversy has developed over opening part of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil explora-
tion. Oil fields in Prudhoe Bay, directly west of the
refuge, supply about 60% of Alaska’s oil and 20% of
the country’s domestic oil, although production is drop-
ping steadily as the oil is extracted. In 1980 Congress
passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation
Act (PL 96-487), which set aside more than 104 million
acres for parks and wilderness areas, including 19 million
acres for the wildlife refuge. The conservation act did
not, however, include the coastal plain.

The U.S. Department of the Interior, in a 1987 report
to Congress, recommended that the 1.5-million-acre
coastal plain be opened for exploration and extraction.
It estimated that 3.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil
exist in the area. It also predicted a 46% chance of
recovering the oil, a high figure by industry standards.
Vast quantities of natural gas are also likely to be found
in the area.
Alaskan corporations supported the proposal because
they wanted to share in the proceeds. Environmentalists
strongly opposed the plan because of potential damage to
the habitats and migration patterns of wildlife such as
caribou, polar and grizzly bears, musk ox, wolves, Arctic
foxes, and millions of nesting birds.
The government report did state that oil exploration
could have a major effect on the migratory caribou herds,
which number about 180,000 animals. While environ-
mentalists estimated that 20% to 40% of the animals
would be threatened, Department of Interior officials
predicted that the caribou would change their migratory
habits.
If the coastal plain were opened to drilling and major
oil reserves were found, oil companies could operate
there for several decades. Debate over opening the region
to oil drilling has continued for decades, but as of mid-
2006 it remained closed to development.
COAL
The Energy Information Administration estimated
U.S. coal reserves at 496.1 billion short tons on January
1, 2004. (See Table 7.4.) About 42% of this coal, 210.8
billion short tons, is underground bituminous coal.
Montana, Illinois, and Wyoming have the largest reserves
of all types of coal.
In addition to untapped coal reserves, large stockpiles
of coal are maintained by coal producers, distributors,
and major consumers (such as electric utility companies
and
industrial
plants)
to
compensate

Notes: Data are for all wells. Service wells, stratigraphic tests, and core tests are excluded. For 1949–1959, data represent wells completed in a given year. For 1960–1969, data are for
well completion reports received by the American Petroleum Institute during the reporting year. For 1970 forward, the data represent wells completed in a given year. The as-received
well completion data for recent years are incomplete due to delays in the reporting of wells drilled. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) therefore statistically imputes the
missing data to provide estimates of total well completions and footage where necessary. Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding. Average depth may not
equal average of components due to independent rounding For data not shown for 1951–1969, see http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/resource.html. For related information, see

interruptions in supply. Although there is little seasonal
change in demand for coal, supply can be affected by
such factors as miners’ strikes and bad weather. Accord-
ing to the Annual Energy Review 2004 (Energy Informa-
tion Administration, 2005), coal stockpiles totaled 147.2
million short tons in 2004. Electric utilities held slightly
more than 72% of this coal, while coal producers and
distributors stocked 24%.
URANIUM
The United States has enough uranium to fuel exist-
ing nuclear reactors for more than forty years, so
exploration for new reserves has been reduced. In
2003 uranium reserves totaled 1.4 billion pounds of
uranium oxide, mostly in Wyoming and New Mexico.
The number of uranium mills producing uranium con-
centrate dropped from eleven at the end of 1997 to two
at the end of 2003, but then rose to five at the end of
December 2005, according to the Energy Information
Administration in its quarterly Domestic Uranium Pro-
duction
Report
(http://eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/dupr/
qupd.html).
INTERNATIONAL RESERVES
Crude Oil
Estimated world crude oil reserves total approxi-
mately one trillion barrels (as of January 1, 2004), with
most of it located in the Middle East. (See Table 7.5,
which provides two different sets of estimates—one from
PennWell’s Oil & Gas Journal and one from Gulf Pub-
lishing Company’s World Oil.) Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iran, Canada, Venezuela,
and Russia have the largest reserves. The United States
has about twenty-two billion barrels of reserves, or 2% of
the world’s total oil reserves.
While countries with large proved reserves have
fewer incentives to find new fields, companies from
many nations have turned their attention to areas where
production has been limited or nonexistent, such as Azer-
baijan, Kazakhstan, and other areas around the Caspian
Sea; the northeast Greenland Shelf; the Niger and Congo
delta areas in Africa; and off Suriname in South America.
The
Energy
Information
Administration
predicts
increased offshore exploration, including in deep water
(International Energy Outlook 2004, 2005). Offshore
production is expected to increase near Algeria, Brazil,
Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela, and in
the North Sea. Deep-sea exploration is expensive, but
could be profitable if oil prices rise.
Natural Gas
Depending on the estimate, Russia and the Middle
East have 4,198.2 trillion or 4,880.2 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas reserves (as of 2004), which amount to
69% or 71% of the world’s estimated reserves. (See
Table 7.5.) Russia has almost twice as much natural
gas in reserve as any other country, while Iran and
Qatar possess the largest natural gas reserves in the
Middle East. Large reserves (more than 100 trillion
cubic feet) are also located in the United Arab Emir-
ates, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Algeria, Vene-
zuela, Nigeria, and Iraq.
Coal
In 2002 worldwide recoverable reserves of coal were
estimated at one trillion short tons. The three countries
with the most plentiful coal reserves are the United States
(271 billion short tons), Russia (173 billion short tons),
and China (126 billion short tons). (See Figure 7.4.)
(Note that the data for the United States are from Decem-
ber 31, 2003, while those for other countries are from
December 31, 2002, the latest figures available.)
Uranium
The countries with the largest known uranium reserves
as of June 2006, according to the World Nuclear Association
(http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/printable_information_
papers/inf75print.htm), are Australia, Kazakhstan, Canada,
the United States, South Africa, Namibia, Brazil, Niger, the
Russian Federation, and Uzbekistan. Australia is estimated
to hold 1.1 million tons, or 24% of the world total, and
Kazakhstan has 816,000 tons (17%). The United States
possesses 7% of the total world reserves of uranium, which
are estimated at 4.7 million tons.

Notes: The information reported for 1964 and prior years is not strictly comparable to that in more recent surveys. Average cost is the arithmetic mean and includes all costs for drilling
and equipping wells and for surface-producing facilities. Wells drilled include exploratory and development wells; excludes service wells, stratigraphic tests, and core tests. For related

CHAPTER 8
ELECTRICITY
Since 1879, when Thomas Edison flipped the first
switch to light Menlo Park, New Jersey, the use of
electrical power has become nearly universal in the Uni-
ted States.
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the
movement of charged particles, such as electrons (nega-
tively charged subatomic particles) and protons (posi-
tively charged subatomic particles). Static electricity,
for example, is caused by friction: When one material
rubs against another it transfers charged particles. The
zap you might feel and the spark you might see when you
drag your feet along the carpet and then touch a metal
doorknob demonstrate static electricity—electrons being
transferred between you and the doorknob.
Electric current is the flow of electric charge; it is
measured in amperes (amps). Electrical power is the rate
at which energy is transferred by electric current. A watt
is the standard measure of electrical power, named after
the Scottish engineer James Watt (1736–1819). The term
wattage refers to the amount of electrical power required
to operate a particular appliance or device. A kilowatt is a
unit of electrical power equal to 1,000 watts, while a
kilowatt-hour is a unit of electrical work equal to that
done by one kilowatt acting for one hour.
Electrical Capacity
The generating capacity of an electrical power plant,
measured in watts, indicates its ability to produce elec-
trical power. A 1,000-kilowatt generator running at full
capacity for one hour supplies 1,000 kilowatt-hours of
power. That generator operating continuously for an
entire year could produce 8.76 million kilowatt-hours of
electricity (1,000 kilowatts  24 hours per day  365
days per year). However, no generator can operate at
100% capacity during an entire year because of legal
restrictions and downtime for routine maintenance and
outages. On average about one-fourth of the generating
capacity of an electrical plant is not available at any
given time.
Electricity demands vary daily and seasonally, so the
continuous operation of electrical generators is usually
not necessary. Utilities depend on steam, nuclear energy,
and large hydroelectric plants to meet routine demand.
Auxiliary gas, turbine, internal combustion, and smaller
hydroelectric plants are used during short periods of high
demand.
An Electric Power System
An electric power system has several components.
Figure 8.1 illustrates a simple electric system. Generating
units (power plants) produce electricity, transmission
lines carry electricity over long distances, and distribu-
tion lines deliver the electricity to customers. Substations
connect the pieces of the system together, while energy
control centers coordinate the operation of all the com-
ponents.
U.S. ELECTRICITY USAGE
In 2004 net generation of electricity totaled nearly 4
trillion kilowatt-hours. Table 8.1 shows that electricity
use in the United States—measured by retail sales of
utility companies—has increased continually since 1949.
In the thirty years between 1974 and 2004 retail sales of
electricity increased 108%, from 1.7 trillion kilowatt-
hours to 3.6 trillion kilowatt-hours.
According to the Energy Information Administration
(Annual Energy Review 2004, 2005, http://tonto.eia.doe.
gov/FTPROOT/multifuel/038404.pdf), coal has been and
continues to be the most-used raw source for electricity
production in the United States. It accounted for approxi-
mately 2 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2004,
about half of the electricity generated. (See Figure 8.2
Energy
107

and Figure 8.3.) Nuclear power was the second-largest
source of electricity (789 billion kilowatt-hours, or 20%
of the total), followed by natural gas (619 billion kilowatt-
hours, or 18%) and hydroelectric power, a renewable
energy source (265 billion kilowatt-hours, or 7%). Very
little electricity (59 billion kilowatt-hours, nearly 4%)
was generated by all other renewable sources combined,
such as geothermal, solar, and wind power.
From 1949 through the early 1990s the industrial
sector was the largest consumer of electricity in the Uni-
ted States. Since then sales to the residential sector have
been higher. After 1998 sales in the commercial sector
became higher than sales in the industrial sector as well.
(See Table 8.2.) In 2004 about 1.3 trillion kilowatt-hours
went to residential users, 1.2 trillion kilowatt-hours to
commercial customers, and 1 trillion kilowatt-hours to
industrial users.
Consumption of electricity in general is growing
because electricity is being used increasingly to perform
tasks that were once done with coal, natural gas, or
human muscle: manufacturing steel, assembling cars,
and milking cows. Electricity is used extensively in tech-
nology fields, such as the computer industry, and resi-
dential and commercial customers need electricity to run
appliances and machinery, such as air conditioners.
THE ELECTRIC BILL
The cost of electricity is affected by the amount of
energy used to create the electricity and move it to the
consumer. In 2004, for example, about 40.8 quadrillion
Btu of energy were consumed by U.S. utilities to generate
14.2 quadrillion Btu of electricity. After accounting for
energy used by the power plants themselves, only 13.5
quadrillion Btu were net generation—the amount avail-
able for transmission to customers. (See Figure 8.2.)

Energy

Almost 27.3 quadrillion Btu were lost when fuel was
converted, and about 1.3 quadrillion Btu were lost during
transmission and distribution (labeled T & D losses in
Figure 8.2). In the end, for every three units of energy
that were converted to create electricity in 2004, slightly
less than one unit actually reached the end user.
Between 1960 and 1970, the price of electricity
declined, but it began to increase during the 1970s because
of an oil embargo by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. (See Figure 8.4.) From the mid-
1980s to 2004 the price of electricity dropped because
prices of energy resources declined. Prices often varied
by location. As Figure 8.5 shows, in 2004 electricity was
most expensive in Hawaii, New York, California, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Alaska, Rhode Island, Massachu-
setts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. According to the
Electric Power Annual 2004 (Energy Information Admin-
istration, 2005, http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/
epa/epa_sum.html), the average price of electricity sold
to the residential sector was $0.09 per kilowatt-hour
in 2004, while the commercial sector paid $0.082 per
kilowatt-hour. Industrial users paid only $0.053 per
kilowatt-hour in 2004 because the huge amounts of electri-
city they use allowed them to receive volume discounts.
The average price for all sectors across the United States
in 2004 was $0.076 per kilowatt-hour.
DEREGULATION OF ELECTRIC UTILITIES
Regulated by the government for decades, electric
utilities are in the midst of a highly controversial shift
toward unregulated markets and increased competition.
In 1978 Congress passed the Public Utilities Regulatory

Policies Act (PL 95-617), which required utilities to buy
electricity from private companies when that would be
cheaper than building their own power plants. The
Energy Policy Act of 1992 (PL 102-486) gave other
electricity generators greater access to the market, result-
ing in widespread debates about regulatory, economic,
energy, and environmental policies. State public utility
commissions conducted proceedings and crafted rules
related to competition.
California was a leader in deregulation. In the sum-
mer of 2000, however, the state experienced rolling elec-
trical blackouts, and electricity bills doubled for many
customers. Fearful of similar blackouts and price spikes,
most other states had slowed or stopped their efforts to
deregulate their electricity markets by the spring of 2001.
At that time, twenty-four states and the District of
Columbia had begun deregulation. Then, during an inves-
tigation of Enron Corporation, documents were found
that
showed
how
Enron’s
electricity
traders
had
boosted profits by using strategies that added to elec-
tricity costs and congestion on transmission lines. As a
result, public confidence in power companies, in gen-
eral, and deregulation, in particular, eroded. As of
February 2003 only seventeen states plus the District
of Columbia were actively engaged in restructuring
their utilities. (See Figure 8.6, which shows the most
recent data available.) In addition, five states had
delayed deregulation, and California had suspended
its restructuring activities. Restructuring was not active
in twenty-seven states.

2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours generated by hydroelectric
power, 2.5 trillion kilowatt-hours from nuclear power
sources, and 0.3 trillion kilowatt-hours from wood, waste,
wind, and other sources. (See Figure 8.7.) According to the
Annual Energy Review 2004, the United States accounted
for 24.7% of this production; China, 11.4%; Japan, 6.3%;
and Russia, 5.7%. Figure 8.8 shows net generation of
electricity by type and by region of the world.
World Consumption
According to the International Energy Annual 2004
(Energy Information Administration, 2005, http://www.
eia.doe.gov/iea/elec.html), total world electricity con-
sumption increased from 9 trillion kilowatt-hours in
1986 to 14.8 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2003. North Amer-
ica, Central America, and South America consumed 5.2
trillion kilowatt-hours, or 35% of the total; Asia and
Oceania used 4.4 trillion kilowatt-hours (30%); Europe,
3.1 trillion (about 21%); and Eurasia, 1.2 trillion (7.9%).
The Middle East and Africa each consumed about 3% of
the world’s electricity.
TRENDS IN THE U.S. ELECTRICAL
POWER INDUSTRY
In Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (2006, http://
www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/index.html), the Energy Infor-
mation Administration predicted that from 2004 to 2025,
total electricity consumption would grow at a rate of
1.6% annually. This compares with 7% growth per year
during the 1960s. Several factors led to this diminished
growth in consumption. For example, in the 1960s con-
sumers were just beginning to switch to electrical appli-
ances, which increased the amount of electricity each
household used; by 2004 appliances were commonplace
and new purchases often replaced existing appliances and
did not drive up total consumption. The efficiency of
appliances had also improved by 2004, so each one used
less electricity. Commercial demand was expected to
grow by 2.2% per year between 2004 and 2025 because
of growth in commercial floor space, while industrial
demand was expected to increase by 1.6% per year as
industrial output rises.
Demand for electricity in the United States has
always been related to economic growth. However, elec-
tricity use is expected to grow more slowly than the gross
domestic product, a measure of economic growth. Figure
8.9 shows how electricity sales are related more to eco-
nomic growth than to population growth. Note that the
phrase five-year moving average means that each point
on the graph is an average for that year’s data plus the
previous four years’ data. This type of averaging is used
to determine long-term averages without the weight of
such cyclical influences as the weather.
The rate of growth of consumption carries financial
risks for electric companies. If the industry underestimates
future needs for electricity, consumers could experience
power shortages or losses. Excessive projections of the

nation’s needs, by contrast, could mean billions of dollars
spent on unneeded equipment.
The Energy Information Administration estimated
that the United States would need 347 gigawatts (a giga-
watt, pronounced ‘‘jigawatt,’’ equals one billion watts) of
new generating capacity from 2005 to 2030 to meet
growing demand for electricity and to replace aging
power plants, most of it after 2015. From 2005 to 2030,
sixty-five gigawatts of capacity are expected to be taken
out of production, mainly old fossil-fired plants that are
not competitive with newer types of fossil-fired plants.
The agency noted that the high cost of natural gas,
petroleum, and coal in 2004–05 led to a jump in electri-
city prices. By 2015, however, as new sources of natural
gas and coal are brought on line, electricity prices should
fall to $0.071 per kilowatt-hour. After 2015, natural gas
and petroleum prices would rise but electricity producers
would rely more on coal for power generation. The result
would be a slow rise in electricity prices to $0.075 cents
per kilowatt-hour in 2030.
Continued concerns about pollution and global warming
could result in tightened environmental emission standards,
which could, in turn, have an impact on electrical utility
expansion, supply, and prices. Advances in solar and wind
turbine technology could make renewable sources of
electrical power more economical. Some energy experts
and environmentalists claim that increased efficiency and
conservation efforts are the most sensible alternatives to
new construction or to the burning of more fossil fuels in
existing plants.

CHAPTER 9
ENERGY CONSERVATION
ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY
Energy conservation is the efficient use of energy,
without necessarily curtailing the services that energy
provides. Conservation occurs when societies develop
efficient technologies that reduce energy needs. Environ-
mental concerns, such as acid rain and the potential for
global warming, have increased public awareness about
the importance of energy conservation.
Energy efficiency can be measured by two indicators.
The first is energy consumption per person (per capita) per
year. Annual per person energy consumption in the United
States was 215 million Btu in 1949. It topped out at
360 million Btu in 1978 and 1979; dropped to 313 million
Btu by 1983; and then slowly rose until it reached 352
million Btu in 2000. It leveled off until 2004, when the
annual rate of consumption per capita was 340 million Btu.
(See Figure 9.1.)
The second indicator of efficiency is energy con-
sumption per dollar of gross domestic product, the total
value of goods and services produced by a nation. When
a country grows in its energy efficiency, it uses less
energy to produce the same amount of goods and
services. In 1949 nearly 19,600 Btu of energy were con-
sumed for each dollar of gross domestic product. (See
Figure 9.2.) In 1970 about 17,990 Btu of energy were
consumed per dollar, and by 2004 only 9,200 Btu were
used per dollar of gross domestic product.
ENERGY CONSERVATION, PUBLIC HEALTH,
AND THE ENVIRONMENT
People living in cities with high levels of pollution
have higher risks of mortality from certain diseases
than those living in less polluted cities. Energy-related
emissions generate a vast majority of these polluting
chemicals. (Table 4.3 in Chapter 4 shows some air pollu-
tants and their sources.) According to the American Lung
Association, air pollution has been related to such dis-
eases as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer.
The group estimated the annual health costs of exposure
to the most serious air pollutants to be in the billions.
Clean and efficient energy technologies, they say, repre-
sent a cost-effective investment in public health.
Global warming is long-term climate change—a
worldwide temperature increase—caused by the ‘‘green-
house effect.’’ This occurs when heat is trapped within
the atmosphere by high levels of carbon dioxide,
methane,
nitrogen
oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, sulfur
dioxides, and perfluorocarbons. Just as the glass of a
greenhouse or the windows of a car trap heat, the ‘‘green-
house gases’’ keep Earth warmer than it would be if the
atmosphere contained only oxygen and nitrogen.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
In 1988 the United Nations established the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 2,000
of the world’s leading scientists. It reported in 1995 that
global warming is real, serious, and accelerating. The
most likely cause, the group said, is primarily the burning
of coal, oil, and gasoline, which has increased the amount
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. Deforestation is another factor, because it
reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed and
stored in plants.
In its Third Assessment Report in 2001 (another is
scheduled for publication in 2007), the group said it had a
clearer understanding of the causes and consequences of
global warming,
largely because
so much climate
research and environmental monitoring had been under-
taken. The group described the effect that global warm-
ing would have on weather patterns, water resources, the
seasons, ecosystems, and extreme climate events, and it
urged governments to move quickly with policies to
protect the planet.

The Kyoto Protocol
In December 1997 the United Nations convened a
160-nation conference on global warming in Kyoto,
Japan, to develop a treaty on climate change that would
place binding caps on industrial emissions. The initial
draft of the treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (or
simply the Kyoto Protocol), bound industrialized nations
to reducing their emissions of six greenhouse gases below
1990 levels. It marked the first time nations made such
sweeping pledges to cut emissions.
Each country had a different target to reach by 2012:
the United States was to cut emissions by 7%, most
European nations by 8%, and Japan by 6%. Reductions
were to begin by 2008. Developing nations were not
required to make such pledges. The United States had
proposed a program of voluntary pledges by developing
nations, but that section was deleted, as was a tough
system of enforcement. Instead, each country was to
decide for itself how to achieve its goal. The draft treaty
provided market-driven tools for reducing emissions. For
example, nations would be allowed to sell emissions
‘‘credits’’ to other nations. The draft treaty also set up a
Clean Development Fund to help poorer nations with
technology to reduce their emissions.
Getting the treaty ratified proved difficult, however.
President Bill Clinton signed the protocol but the U.S.
Senate did not ratify it. To save the treaty, diplomats
from 178 nations met in Bonn, Germany, in July 2001
and drafted a compromise treaty. In October 2001, 2,000
delegates from 160 countries worked for 12 days in
Marrakech, Morocco, to complete a final draft of the
Kyoto Protocol.
President George W. Bush rejected that final draft of
the Kyoto Protocol, characterizing it as ‘‘fatally flawed.’’
He said implementation of the treaty would harm the U.S.
economy and unfairly require only the industrial nations
to cut emissions. In particular, he noted that neither
China, the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse
gases, nor India, another high emitter, were bound by the
protocol. He said at the time:
Our country, the United States, is the world’s largest
emitter of man-made greenhouse gases. We account for
almost 20% of the world’s man-made greenhouse emis-
sions. We also account for about one-quarter of the
world’s economic output. We recognize the responsi-
bility to reduce our emissions. We also recognize the
other part of the story—that the rest of the world emits
80% of all greenhouse gases. And many of those emis-
sions come from developing countries. . . .
We recognize our responsibility and will meet it—at
home, in our hemisphere, and in the world. My Cabinet-
level working group on climate change is recommend-
ing a number of initial steps, and will continue to work
on additional ideas. The working group proposes the
United States help lead the way by advancing the
science on climate change, advancing the technology
to monitor and reduce greenhouse gases, and creating
partnerships within our hemisphere and beyond to
monitor and measure and mitigate emissions.
When Russia ratified the treaty in November 2004
the Kyoto Protocol had support from countries whose
emissions totaled 55% of the world’s greenhouse gases,
which was the minimum needed for the treaty to go into
effect. At the end of that year 130 countries had signed
on, including all the European Union members, Japan,
and Norway. The Kyoto Protocol took effect on February
16, 2005, without the support of the United States and
Australia.

U.S. attitudes about the Kyoto Protocol varied
widely. Most business leaders said the treaty went too
far and was too costly for the U.S. economy, while
environmentalists said the treaty’s standards did not go
far enough. Some experts doubted that any action emer-
ging from Kyoto would be sufficient to prevent the
doubling
of
greenhouse
gases.
In
May
2005—in
response to the Bush administration’s policies—mayors
from 132 cities in the United States joined a bipartisan
coalition to fight global warming on the local level. The
coalition pledged to have their cities meet Kyoto Pro-
tocol requirements for the United States: a reduction
of heat-trapping gas emissions to 7% below 1990 levels
by 2012.
Levels of greenhouse gas emissions for the United
States for 1990 and from 1998 to 2004 are shown in
Table 9.1 in teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalents
(Tg C02 Eq.). A teragram is a trillion grams. Each gas
in the table is reported by its global-warming potential in
Tg, which allows these numbers to be compared. Higher
numbers indicate greater harm done to the environment
by the gas. Conversely, numbers in parentheses are for
sources, such as land-use change and forestry, that reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by the carbon equivalents
shown. In 2004 emissions of greenhouse gases in the
United States reached 6,294.3 Tg, which was 1,085.7
Tg, or 21%, higher than emissions in 1990.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN TRANSPORTATION
The U.S. transportation system plays a central role in
the economy. Highway transportation is dependent on
vehicles with internal combustion engines, which are
fueled almost exclusively by petroleum. According to
the Energy Information Administration of the U.S.
Department of Energy (Annual Energy Review 2004,
2005), the transportation sector accounted for 28% of
all energy consumed in the United States in 2004.
Americans used 27.8 quadrillion Btu of energy for trans-
portation that year (see Figure 1.9 in Chapter 1), of which
petroleum made up 97%. Despite the improvements in
transportation efficiency in recent decades, the agency
expects the transportation sector to consume 37.3 quad-
rillion Btu in 2030 (International Energy Outlook 2006,
2006).
Automotive Efficiency
Policy makers interested in the energy used for trans-
portation have an array of conservation options. (See
Table 9.2.) However, not all options are mutually sup-
portive. For example, efforts to promote a freer flow of
automobile traffic, such as high-occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes or free parking for car pools, may sabotage
efforts to shift travelers to mass transit or to reduce trip
lengths and frequency.
In the United States the automobile dominates the
transportation sector; cars and light-duty vehicles used
83% of all transportation energy in 2006, as reported by
the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (National Trans-
portation Statistics, 2006, 2006). The Annual Energy
Review 2004 also noted that motor gasoline, which is
divided among passenger cars, light- and heavy-duty
trucks, aircraft, and miscellaneous other modes of trans-
portation, consumed about 68% of the oil used in the
United States in 2004.
The major growth in fuel use since the 1970s has
been that consumed by pickup trucks and, in more recent
years, that consumed by vans and sport-utility vehicles.
In 2004 the amount used in pickup trucks, vans, and sport-
utility vehicles was approximately 75% of the amount
used in automobiles and motorcycles. Meanwhile, the use
of automobile fuel has remained fairly constant because
increases in fuel efficiency have offset the growth in car
miles traveled. Boosting efficiency of trucks, vans, and
sport-utility vehicles will become increasingly important
in controlling the demand for oil.
THE
CORPORATE
AVERAGE
FUEL
ECONOMY
STANDARDS. The 1973 oil embargo by the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries painfully reminded
the United States how dependent it had become on for-
eign sources of fuel. It prompted Congress to pass the
1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (PL 94-163),
which set the initial Corporate Average Fuel Economy
standards. The standards were modified in 1980 with the
Automobile Fuel Efficiency Act (PL 96-425).
The standards required domestic automakers to
increase the average mileage of new cars sold to 27.5
miles per gallon (mpg) by 1985. Manufacturers could
still sell large, less efficient cars, but to meet the aver-
age fuel efficiency rates, they also had to sell smaller,
more efficient cars. Automakers that failed to meet each
year’s standards were fined; those that managed to
surpass the rates earned credits that they could use in
years when they fell below the requirements. While
keeping their cars relatively large and roomy, compa-
nies managed to improve mileage with such innovations
as electronic fuel injection, which supplied fuel to an
automotive engine more efficiently than its predecessor,
the carburetor.
The standards have had a significant effect. Fuel
economy of all motor vehicles (which includes passen-
ger cars, vans, pickup trucks, sport-utility vehicles, and
trucks) increased from 11.9 miles per gallon (mpg) in
1973 to 17 mpg in 2003. (See Table 9.3.) Greater gains
have been made in the economy of passenger cars. In
1974, just after the oil embargo, cars averaged 13.6
mpg; in 2003 the average new-car fuel economy was
22.3 mpg.

121

The Environmental Protection Agency computes the
data in a different way, using a procedure called a three-
year moving average. A graph of their results (see Figure
9.3) shows that the fuel economy of cars and trucks
increased rapidly from 1975 to the mid-1980s. The
increase slowed through the late 1980s, declined through
the mid-1990s, and then remained relatively stable.
The total fuel economy of automobiles is expected to
increase as more fuel-efficient cars enter the market and
older, less fuel-efficient autos drop out of operation.
However, new-car fuel economy has risen only slightly
since 1986, and nearly all gains in automobile efficiency
have been offset by increased weight and power in new
vehicles since 1988.

Fuel economy is expected to increase for the light-
truck automotive group that includes sport-utility vehi-
cles, vans, and pickup trucks. It is the fastest-growing
segment of the auto industry, accounting for about half of
the U.S. light-vehicle market in 2004 (see Figure 9.4) and
producing most of the profits of the major auto compa-
nies. In 1996 Congress authorized the Department of
Transportation to set a standard of 20.7 mpg for light
trucks. That standard was increased to 21 mpg for model
year 2005, to 21.6 mpg for model year 2006, and to 22.2
mpg for model year 2007.
In
1999
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
imposed regulations tightening emissions standards on
cars, minivans, small pickup trucks, and sport-utility vehi-
cles weighing less than 8,500 pounds. This was the first
time that sport-utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks
became subject to the same national pollution standards as
cars. The standard of an average of 0.07 grams per mile
for nitrogen oxides went into effect in 2004. Standards for
hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and
particulates were phased in, beginning through 2008.
The potential for increased fuel economy in large
trucks is considered huge, because their current fuel
economy is so much lower than that of automobiles. In
2004 the National Commission on Energy Policy noted
that tractor-trailers consumed two-thirds of all truck
fuel—1.5 million barrels per day in 2000. Research
sponsored by the commission determined that the aver-
age fuel economy for new tractor-trailers could be raised
by 29% in 2008 and by 58% in 2015. If the heavy-truck
fleet were to reach a fuel efficiency of 10 mpg through
technological improvements, projected oil demand would
drop by 300,000 barrels per day.
Cheap gasoline prices throughout the 1990s took away
the sense of urgency surrounding fuel efficiency, which
was demonstrated by the high growth of large-vehicle sales.
In addition, after repeal of the federal law that set the speed
limit at 55 miles per hour, many states allowed higher speed
limits, which lowered fuel efficiency.
Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
NUMBERSANDTYPES.In1995almost250,000alternative-
fuel vehicles were on U.S. roads. By 2004 that total had
increased to 547,904. (See Table 9.4.) These totals include
vehicles originally manufactured to run on alternative fuels as
wellasgasolineordieselvehiclesthathadbeenconverted.The
manufacture of new alternative-fuel vehicles has increased
steadily.
A number of different types of fuels are used in these
vehicles, as shown in Table 9.4:
• Liquefied petroleum gas is a mixture of propane and
butane. Thirty-five percent of all alternative-fuel vehi-
cles ran on liquefied petroleum gas in 2004.
• Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a grain alcohol, mixed with
gasoline and sold as gasohol. The 85% formulation of
gasohol was the second most common fuel for these
vehicles in 2004, powering 27% of them.
• Compressed natural gas is natural gas that is stored in
pressurized tanks. When burned, it releases one-tenth
the carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitrogen of

gasoline. It powered 26% of alternative-fuel vehicles
in 2004.
• Electricity, used by 10% of alternative-fuel vehicles
in 2004, can be used for battery-powered, fuel-cell, or
hybrid vehicles.
• Methanol is a liquid fuel that can be produced from
natural gas, coal, or biomass (plant material, vegeta-
tion, or agricultural waste). The 85% formulation of
methanol was used by only 0.8% of all alternative-
fuel vehicles in 2004. Its use is declining.
• Liquefied natural gas is natural gas (mostly methane)
that has been liquefied by reducing its temperature to
260 Fahrenheit. It was used by only 0.6% of all
alternative-fuel vehicles in 2004.
• Biodiesels (not listed in Table 9.4) are liquid biofuels
made from soybean, rapeseed, or sunflower oil. They
can also be made from animal tallow and such agri-
cultural by-products as rice hulls.
The largest numbers of alternative-fuel vehicles are
located in California, Texas, New York, and Oklahoma.
(See Table 9.5.) In 2004 U.S. cities had 9,116 alternative-
fuel buses on their streets. Most were transit buses, rather
than school buses, intercity buses, or trolleys (‘‘Table 35:
Number of Onroad Alternative Fuel Buses in Use by
Transit Agencies, by Bus Type, Fuel Type and Configu-
ration, 2004,’’ Energy Information Administration, http://
www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/atftables/t3504.xls).
ALTERNATIVE-FUEL VEHICLES AND THE MARKET-
PLACE. A fuel supply must be readily available if
alternative-fuel vehicles are to become a viable transpor-
tation option. Ideally, an infrastructure for supplying
alternative fuels would be developed simultaneously with
the vehicles. Table 9.6 shows the types and numbers of
alternative-fuel stations available in each state. In April
2006 more than 5,000 alternative fueling sites were in
operation in the United States. Privately owned vehicles
used 319 million gallons, or 71% of the total 447.2
million gallons of alternative fuel consumed in the United
States during 2004; state and local vehicles used 115.8
million gallons (26%), and federal vehicles used 12.4
million gallons (3%). (See Table 9.7.)
Chrysler Corporation stopped making natural-gas
vehicles after model year 1997 because it had lost money,
selling only 4,000 of them after production began in
1992. General Motors, which had suspended sales of
natural-gas vehicles in 1994, resumed sales in 1997. Ford
began selling some natural-gas versions of its cars and
trucks in 1995. Commercial fleets (airport vehicles,
school and transit buses, and taxicabs), not retail custo-
mers, are the main buyers of natural-gas vehicles.
In the early days of the automobile, electric cars
outnumbered vehicles with internal-combustion engines.
With the introduction of technology for producing low-
cost gasoline, however, electric vehicles fell out of favor.
However, as cities became choked with air pollution, the
idea of an efficient electric car reemerged. To make it
acceptable to the public, several considerations have had
to be addressed: How many miles could an electric car be
driven before it needed to be recharged? How lightweight
would the vehicle need to be? And could the electric car

keep up with the speed and driving conditions of busy
freeways and highways?
Electric vehicles can be battery powered, run on fuel
cells, or be hybrids, which are powered by both an
electric motor and a small conventional engine. EV1, a
two-seater by General Motors (GM), was the first com-
mercially available electric car. In 1999 the company
introduced its second-generation electric car, the Gen II,
which used a lead-acid battery pack and had a driving
range of approximately ninety-five miles. The Gen II was
also offered with an optional nickel-metal hydride battery
pack, which increased its range to 130 miles. However,
after the California Air Resources Board relaxed automobile-
emissions requirements, phasing them in through 2017,
rather than by 2003, GM found that it could no longer
market the electric cars effectively. When leases on the
cars ran out in 2003, GM began reclaiming them.
Fuel-cell electric vehicles use an electrochemical
process that converts a fuel’s energy into usable electricity.
Fuel cells produce very little sulfur and nitrogen dioxide
and generate less than half the carbon dioxide of internal-
combustion engines. Rather than needing to be recharged,
they are simply refueled. Hydrogen, natural gas, methanol,
and gasoline can all be used with a fuel cell.
DaimlerChrysler’s Mercedes-Benz division unveiled
the first drivable fuel-cell car in 1999. Called the New
Electric Car, it produced zero emissions, ran on liquid
hydrogen, and traveled 280 miles on a full 11-gallon
tank. Several models have been road tested since. Eco-
star, an alliance between Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and
Ballard Power Systems, is also working on developing
new fuel cells to power vehicles. In 2006 about 300 fuel-
cell cars were being tested worldwide. Hydrogen fuel-
cell cars are expected to be available to consumers in
2010.
Hybrid cars have both an electric motor and a small
internal-combustion engine. A sophisticated computer
system automatically shifts from the electric motor to

the gas engine, as needed, for optimum driving. The
electric motor is recharged while the car is driving and
braking. Because the gasoline engine does only part of
the work, fuel economy is high. The engines are also
designed to produce very low emissions.
In 2002 two hybrid passenger cars were introduced in
the United States: the Toyota Prius, a sedan with front
and back seating, and the two-passenger Honda Insight.
Both cars were sold in Japan for several years before
being introduced to the U.S. market. In model year
2005 Ford offered the first hybrid sport-utility vehicle,
the Escape, which won the 2004 North American Truck
of the Year award. The vehicle is reported to get 35 mpg
with city driving, traveling about 400 miles on a 15-
gallon tank. By model year 2006 many auto manufac-
turers—including Honda, Ford, Toyota, Lexus, and
Mercury—offered gas-electric hybrids.
MANDATING ALTERNATIVE FUELS. Several laws have
been passed to encourage or mandate the use of vehicles
powered by fuels other than gasoline. The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (PL 101-549) required certain busi-
nesses and local governments with fleets of ten or more
vehicles in twenty-one metropolitan areas to phase in
alternative-fuel vehicles over time—20% of those fleets
had to be alternative-fuel vehicles by 1998. While great
strides have been made, compliance with the mandates
cannot be determined because reporting and enforcement
methods are inadequate.
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (PL 102-486) was
passed in the wake of the 1991 Persian Gulf War to
conserve energy and increase the proportion of energy
supplied domestically. It required that 75% of all vehicles
purchased by the federal government in 1999 and there-
after be alternative-fuel vehicles. Agency budget cuts and
inadequate enforcement have slowed compliance with
these regulations. Still, many municipal governments
and the U.S. Postal Service have put into operation fleets
of natural-gas vehicles, such as garbage trucks, transit
buses, and postal vans.

industrialized
world,
air
travel
is
replacing
more
energy-efficient rail or bus travel. According to the
Bureau of Transportation Statistics (part of the Depart-
ment of Transportation), jet fuel consumption rose
from 12.7 billion gallons in 1995 to 13 billion gallons
in 2003.
Jet fuel consumption can affect global warming.
Airplanes spew nearly four million tons of nitrogen
oxide into the air each year, much of it while cruising
in the tropospheric zone five to seven miles above the
planet, where ozone is formed. (See Figure 9.5.) The
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that air
traffic accounts for about 3% of all global greenhouse
warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, which was established by the United Nations,
noted that emissions deposited directly into the atmo-
sphere do greater harm than those released at ground
level.
Although each generation of airplane engines gets
cleaner and more fuel efficient, there are also other
engines in the airline industry—those in the trucks, cars,
and carts that service airplane fleets. Electric utility
companies, including the Edison Electric Institute and
the Electric Power Research Institute, launched a pro-
gram in 1993 to electrify airports. By converting term-
inal transport buses, food trucks, and baggage-handling
carts to electricity, airports could reduce air pollution
considerably. As of December 2005, only a few U.S.
airports and airlines were operating significant numbers
of electric ground-support equipment. However, airport
electrification
implementation
and
research
were
ongoing.
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL
CONSERVATION
Total energy use in buildings in the United States has
increased because the numbers of people, households, and
offices has increased. However, energy use per unit area
(commercial) or per person (residential) has roughly stabi-
lized through a variety of efficiency measures. The sources
of energy in buildings have changed dramatically. Use of
fuel oil has dropped, with natural gas making up most of the
difference. At the same time, other energy demands have
risen. Electronic office equipment, such as computers, fax
machines, printers, and copiers, have sharply increased elec-
tricity loads in commercial buildings. According to the
Annual Energy Review 2004, energy use in the residential
and commercial sectors accounted for an increasing share of
total U.S. energy consumption: 29% in 1950, 33% in 1970,
and 39% in 2004.
Building Efficiency
Energy conservation in buildings in both the residen-
tial and commercial sectors has improved considerably
since the early 1980s. Among the techniques for reducing
energy use are advanced window designs, ‘‘daylighting’’
(letting light in from the outside by adding a skylight or
building a large building around an atrium), solar water
heating, landscaping, and planting trees.
Residential energy consumption has been reduced by
building more efficient new housing and appliances,
improving energy efficiency in existing housing, and
building more multiple-family units. Also, many people
have migrated to the South and West, where their
combined use of heating and cooling has generally been
lower than usage in other parts of the country.

aThe remaining portion of 85-percent methanol and both ethanol fuels is gasoline.
bIn 1997, some vehicle manufacturers began including E85-fueling capability in certain model lines of vehicles. For 2002, the EIA estimated that the number of E-85 vehicles that are
capable of operating on E85, gasoline, or both, is about 4.1 million. Many of these alternative-fueled vehicles (AFVs) are sold and used as traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. In this
table, AFVs in use include only those E85 vehicles believed to be intended for use as AFVs. These are primarily fleet-operated vehicles.
cExcludes gasoline-electric hybrids.

In the residential sector the largest share of energy
savings has been the result of better construction, higher
quality insulation, and more energy-efficient windows and
doors. According to the Office of Technology Assessment
(Building Energy Efficiency, 1992), roughly one-fourth the
energy used to heat and cool buildings is lost through poor
insulation and poorly insulated windows. Before the 1973
energy crisis, 70% of new windows sold were single-glazed
(only a single pane of glass). By 1990, because of changes
in building codes and public interest, 80% of windows sold
were double-glazed, cutting energy loss in half. Double-
glazed windows have two panes of glass sandwiched
together with a small space in between. The glass may be
specially treated or the space between the panes may be
filled with a gas, either of which increases the insulating
effectiveness of the window.

Energy Conservation
Energy

Overall, however, energy consumption per household
has remained fairly steady since 1982. Technology gains
have been offset by an increase in the size of new homes
and more demand for energy services. (See Figure 9.6.)
As in the residential sector, improved technology,
materials, and construction methods have helped to slow
the growth of energy use in commercial buildings. Glass-
walled buildings, especially, have undergone transforma-
tion: Certain types of glass are now chosen for their
ability to divert the heat of the sun and reduce the amount
of energy needed for cooling. Like homes, many com-
mercial structures are now designed to take advantage of
breezes and to deflect the coldest winter winds.

*The remaining portion of 85-percent methanol and both ethanol fuels is gasoline. Consumption data include the gasoline portion of the fuel.
Notes: Fuel quantities are expressed in a common base unit of gasoline-equivalent gallons to allow comparisons of different fuel types. Gasoline-equivalent gallons do not represent gasoline displacement. Gasoline equivalent is computed by dividing the
lower heating value of the alternative fuel by the lower heating value of gasoline and multiplying this result by the alternative fuel consumption value. Lower heating value refers to the Btu content per unit of fuel excluding the heat produced by
condensation of water vapor in the fuel. Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding. Estimates for 2004, are based on plans or projections. Estimates for historical years maybe revised in future reports if new information
becomes available.

the
Energy
Information
Administration,
residential
energy use accounted for slightly more than 21% of total
national energy consumption in 2004. In 2001 (the most
recent year for which the agency has compiled data) space
heating used 47% of the total residential energy con-
sumed, down from 51% in 1997; appliances 30%, up from
27%; water heating 17%, down from 19%; and air condi-
tioners 6%, up from 4%.
The number of electrical appliances in U.S. house-
holds has increased steadily over the past few of decades.
(See Figure 9.7, which is based on the most recent data
compiled by the Energy Information Administration.) By
2001 about 99% of American homes had color tele-
visions, 86% had microwave ovens, 79% had clothes
washers, and 56% had personal computers.
In 1987 Congress passed the National Appliance Energy
Conservation Act (PL 100-12), which gave the Department
of Energy the authority to formulate minimum efficiency
requirements for thirteen classes of consumer products. It
could also revise and update those standards as technologies
and economic conditions changed. Table 9.8 shows the
products affected and the years in which appliance efficiency
standards were established or revised for each, as well as the
future effective dates of standards.
Energy efficiency has increased for all major household
appliances but most dramatically for refrigerators and free-
zers.Since1972theenergyefficiencyofnewrefrigeratorsand
freezers has more than tripled because of better insulation,
motors, compressors, and accessories such as automatic
defrost (Brian Halweill, ‘‘Good Stuff? A Behind-the-Scenes
Guide to the Things We Buy: Appliances,’’ World Watch
Institute, 2006, http://www.worldwatch.org/pubs/goodstuff/
appliances/this.href). These improvements have been accom-
plished at relatively low cost to manufacturers. In addition,
efficiencylabelsarenowrequiredonappliances,whichmakes
purchasing efficient models easier.
According the Department of Energy, by the early
2000s, air conditioners and heat pumps, another major
group of appliances, had shown a 30% to 50% improve-
ment
in
energy
efficiency
since
the
mid-1970s.
Although this improvement in energy efficiency was
less than the improvements in refrigerators and freezers,
it is significant because these appliances are large
energy users.
Efficiency of water heaters and furnaces improved
between 5% and 20% from the mid-1970s to the early
2000s. However, the technological improvements in
these appliances are relatively costly compared with the
overall price of the products, so energy-conserving
models have higher retail prices. This discourages many
consumers from purchasing them, even though the more
efficient models may save money in the long run. In
addition, many water heaters and furnaces are bought
by builders, who have little incentive to pay more for
the most efficient models, or by homeowners in emer-
gency situations, when availability and installation seem
much more important than energy efficiency.

In addition to concerns about efficiency, appliance
makers—especially those who make refrigerators and
air-conditioning
systems—are
developing
alternative
cooling
techniques
to
replace
chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), which are ozone-damaging chemicals that can
no longer be legally sold in the United States. CFCs
were initially substituted with somewhat less dangerous
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), but they are now
being replaced with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which
lack chlorine. In Europe, other substances, such as
propane and butane, are being used as refrigerants.
Known as ‘‘greenfreeze’’ technology, these materials
are rapidly replacing HCFCs.
Lawn and Garden Equipment
In
1994
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
reported that as much as 10% of the nation’s air pollution
was generated by gasoline-powered lawn and garden
equipment, including lawn mowers, chain saws, and golf
carts. Carol Browner, who was the agency’s administra-
tor at the time, estimated that Americans used eighty-nine
million pieces of such equipment, with lawn mowers
alone accounting for 5% of the nation’s air pollution.
Under Browner, the agency established engine label and
warranty requirements, exhaust emissions standards, and test
procedures, requiring that engine makers meet the new
requirements by 1996. Effective that year, new products were
equipped with improved carburetion systems, and additional
standards were scheduled for subsequent years. Agency
officials reported in 2000 that the new regulations had
reduced smog-forming hydrocarbon emissions by 32% and
projected that additional standards, to be phased in by 2007,
would reduce hydrocarbon emissions an additional 10%.
INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS
OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS
One test of a country’s efficiency is the amount of energy
itconsumesforeverydollarofgoodsandservicesitproduces.
According to the Energy Information Administration (Inter-
national Energy Annual 2003, 2005), the United States lags
behind some industrialized countries in energy efficiency and
conservation efforts, but is also considerably ahead of others.
In 2003 the United States consumed 9,521 Btu per dollar (in
2000 U.S. dollars) of gross domestic product compared with
8,269 for France, 7,545 for Germany, and 4,605 for Japan.
That same year, however, Canada consumed 17,863 Btu per
dollar of gross domestic product; Belgium, 11,465; and
Spain, 10,217. If fuel prices continue to increase, countries
that are least efficient could face serious economic challenges
from those that have embraced efficiency and conservation.
Because the United States is the world’s largest
producer of greenhouse gases, its emissions per capita are
also significantly higher than those in other industrialized
countries. For instance, the International Energy Annual
2003 determined the ‘‘carbon intensity’’ of countries by
comparing the metric tons of carbon dioxide they produce
per thousand dollars of gross domestic product. The figures
for 2003 showed that the carbon intensity of the United
States was substantially higher than that of many other
industrialized nations. For example, the carbon intensity
of the United States was 0.56, while Germany’s was 0.45,
France’s was 0.30, and Japan’s was 0.25. Spain’s carbon

Canada’s was 0.80 and Belgium’s was 0.60.
FUTURE TRENDS IN CONSERVATION
According to the Annual Energy Outlook 2006
(Energy Information Administration, 2006), U.S. total
energy consumption is expected to increase at a fairly
steady rate from nearly 100 quadrillion Btu in 2004 to
about 130 quadrillion Btu in 2030, even with efficiency
standards for new equipment taken into consideration.
Per capita energy use is expected to increase slightly by
0.3% per year from 2004 through 2030. (See Figure 9.8.)
According to the projections, homes would be larger
in 2030, but electricity would be used more efficiently.
Higher energy prices would encourage conservation.
Although annual personal highway and air travel would
increase, efficiency improvements would offset much of
that increase. Energy use per dollar of gross domestic
product is expected to decrease at an average annual rate
of 1.8% from 2004 to 2030 as efficiency gains are made.
The agency also projected that transportation fuel
efficiency
for
light-duty
vehicles
would
improve
slowly from 2004 through 2030. The average fuel
economy for new light-duty vehicles is expected to
rise to 29.2 mpg in 2030. (See Figure 9.9.) It dropped
from 1987 through 2004 because the standard for light
trucks, which are included in this group, was set at
20.7 mpg, rather than the 27.5 mpg standard for cars.
However,
the
standard
for
these
vehicles
(which
include sport-utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup
trucks) was increased to 21 mpg for model year
2005; to 21.6 mpg for model year 2006; and to 22.2
mpg for model year 2007. Additional increases are
proposed for model years 2008 through 2011.
The Annual Energy Outlook 2004 predicted that the
market for alternative-fuel vehicles would grow as a result
of federal and state mandates. By 2025, about 3.9 million
alternative-fuel vehicles are expected to be sold—about
19% of total light-duty vehicle sales. Alternative fuels
could replace about 166,500 barrels of oil per day by
2025, or 2.1% of all light-vehicle consumption.
