Photoshop CS All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies

T
here’s a reason why Photoshop is the world’s industry standard in image-editing soft-
ware. The depth and breadth of the program is unheralded. Photoshop immediately
sucks you in with its easy-to-use interface and powerful tools and commands. It is so fea-
ture rich that you soon begin to lose track of time and start blowing off your commitments
just to try one more thing. And just when you think you’ve finally explored every nook and
cranny and mastered the program, you suddenly read a tip in a book or magazine that enlight-
ens you about something you didn’t know. Or even more likely, you stumble upon some great
effect while working on a late-night project. That’s the beauty of Photoshop. It’s the program
that just keeps giving.
The depth and breadth of Photoshop has downsides, too, of course. You must make a major
time commitment and invest much effort to master it — hence the large number of books writ-
ten on the program. Walk into your neighborhood bookstore or type Photoshop in the Search
field at any online bookseller’s site, and you’ll see a barrage of choices. Some books are gen-
eral reference books, some are targeted toward the novice user, and others focus on a specific
mission, such as color management or restoration and retouching.
About This Book
This book is written for the person who has a good grasp of using a computer and navigating
the operating system and at least a cursory knowledge of Photoshop. It is intended to be a
comprehensive reference book that you can read cover to cover or reach for when you’re
looking for specific information about a particular task.
Introduction

What’s in This Book
2
Wherever I can, I sneak in a useful tip or an interesting technique to help you put Photoshop
to work for your project needs.
Numbered steps
When you see a sequence of triangles just before a section heading, you know that the section
you’re about to read contains a numbered sequence that shows you how to complete a spe-
cific task. Steps appear in an easy-to-follow, two-column format, along with plenty of images to
help you out.
If you see a black box around a step number, it indicates that a figure accompanies that step.
For example, if the 2 in Step 2 has a black box around it, a figure that follows corresponds with
that step. The figure itself will have a numbered callout referencing the step number.
Putting It Together
Sometimes, knowing how to use a tool doesn’t necessarily mean that you know what to do
with it. That’s why this book contains several exercises that help you make a connection
between the multiple Photoshop tools at your disposal and the very specific task you need to
accomplish. Want to get the red out of a subject’s eyes or create a collage? Just check out the
Putting-It-Together sections in Books III through X. These sections present info in easy-to-
follow numbered steps, in a hands-on style, building on what’s presented in the chapter so
that you can go to the next level, put concepts to work, and move on to the next task.
What’s in This Book
This book is broken down into minibooks, each covering a general topic. Each minibook con-
tains several chapters, each covering a more specific topic under the general one. Each chap-
ter is then divided into sections, and some of those sections have subsections. I’m sure you
get the picture.
You can read the book from front to back, or you can dive right into the minibook or chapter
of your choice. Either way works just fine. Anytime a concept is mentioned that isn’t covered
in depth in that chapter, you find a cross-reference to another book and chapter where you
find all the details. If you’re looking for something specific, check out either the Table of
Contents or the index.
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of the book helps you remember all the shortcuts you’ll use
most often. Tear it out, tape it to your monitor, and don’t forget to say, “Thanks.” You’re very
welcome.
And finally, I’ve got pictures. Lots of them. And many of these pictures have callouts that point
to specific steps or identify important concepts, buttons, tools, or options. With a program
like Photoshop, an image often speaks louder than words.
This book contains ten minibooks. The following sections offer a quick synopsis of what each
book contains.

Book I: Photoshop Fundamentals
Ready to get your feet wet with the basics of Photoshop? Head to Book I. Here’s where you get
familiar with the Photoshop environment — the desktop, the menus, and the palettes. I also
briefly introduce the tools and explain what each one does.
In this book, I cover how to get started on Photoshop and how to view and navigate your
image window. Here’s also where I give you all the important details about the o’mighty File
Browser and also how to customize your workspace and preference settings. 
Finally, I go into the bare basics of printing, and then how to save files and close Photoshop.
Book II: Image Essentials
This book covers all those nitpicky — but critical — details about images, such as size, resolu-
tion, pixel dimension, image mode, and file format. Turn to this book to find out how to safely
resize your image without causing undue damage. 
You can also find out how to crop images and increase their canvas size. In addition, I breeze
through basic color theory and get you started using and managing color.
But wait, there’s more. I give you the lowdown on the History palette and brushing and eras-
ing to history. And, if that’s not enough, I throw in a chapter on applying annotations and
notes to your image and using and creating actions for enhanced productivity.
Book III: Selections
This important book gives you all the juicy details and techniques on creating and modifying
selections and paths. You find out about each of the selection tools and also the powerful —
albeit sometimes unruly — Pen tool and its accompanying Paths palette.
Book IV: Painting, Drawing, and Typing
If you want to know about the drawing and painting tools, this is the book for you. Here I
cover the Brush and Pencil tools, along with the once again improved Brushes palette. I also
show you how to create vector shapes by using the shape tools, and how to fill and stroke
selections. 
Head to this book to find out how to create both gradients and patterns and, last but not least,
become familiar with the type tools and how to use them to create and edit both standard
type, type on and in a path, and type with special effects.
Book V: Working with Layers
Layers are an integral component in a Photoshop image, and Book V is where I explain them.
In this book, you discover how to create and edit layers and how to use multiple images to
create a multilayered composite image. I also introduce you to the various ways that you can
manage layers for maximum efficiency, including using the new Layer Comps palette. Finally, I
show you how to enhance your layers by applying different blend modes, opacity settings,
layer styles, styles, and clipping groups.

Book VI: Channels and Masks
This book gives you all the how-tos you need to work with channels and masks. I show you
how to save and edit selections as alpha channels so that you can reload them later. And I
show you how to work with the various kinds of masks — quick masks, layer masks, and
channel masks — and how you can use each to select difficult elements. I also cover other
masking techniques, such as erasing and using the Color Range command.
Book VII: Filters and Distortions
I filled this book with tons of handy tips and techniques on using filters to correct your images
to make them sharper, blurrier, cleaner, and smoother — whatever fits your fancy. You also
find out how to use filters to give your image a certain special effect, such as a deckled edge
or water droplets. Then I introduce the Liquify command so that you can see the wonder of its
distortion tools — and how they can turn your image into digital taffy.
Book VIII: Retouching and Restoration
Everything you need to know about color correction or color enhancement can be found in
Book VIII — getting rid of colorcasts, improving contrast and saturation, remapping, and
replacing colors.
In addition, I included a chapter on using the focus and toning tools to manually lighten,
darken, smooth, soften, and sharpen areas of your image. You get to see how you can use the
Clone Stamp tool, and the Healing Brush and Patch tools to fix flaws and imperfections in your
images, making them good as new. And finally, I introduce you to the new Color Replacement
tool and show you how to replace your image’s original color with the foreground color.
Book IX: Photoshop and the Web
This book gives you the lowdown on preparing your images for the Web. Find out how to opti-
mize your images for maximum quality and quick download times. You also find information
on slicing your images and creating a photo gallery that you can easily post on the Web. I
show you where Photoshop comes to an end with its Web-friendly tools and where
ImageReady then picks up the ball.
Book X: Photoshop and Print
If you need to get the scoop on how to prep your images for print, this is the book you need to
check out. Here you find the details on how to get the right resolution, image mode, and file
format for various applications. You also discover how to set up both process and spot color
separations. If you also work with other programs, I provide a chapter on how Photoshop
plays nicely with other programs. And, for good measure, I throw in a chapter on how to
create contact sheets and picture packages from your digital masterpieces.

Conventions Used in This Book

Appendix A: Working with Digital Cameras and Scanners
If you own either a digital camera or a scanner, be sure to take a gander at Appendix A. You
find lots of juicy tidbits on prepping your images for scanning and then cleaning them up
afterward. I also include some useful information on getting images from your camera into
Photoshop.
Appendix B: A Visual Reference of Photoshop Tools
If you’re like me, you’re probably reeling from all the tools and options. Which one does what?
How do you know which to choose? Check out Appendix B for a visual reference that shows
you each of the tools — as well as what the tools do. How’s that for handy?
Color Insert
Trying to illustrate the powers of Photoshop without showing some images in full, living color
is about as useful as if I handed you a broken umbrella on a rainy day. The 16-page color insert
does just that, so don’t miss it.
Conventions Used in This Book
You’ll find that this book is cross-platform. Windows commands are given first, followed by
Mac commands in parentheses, like this:
Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
And occasionally, text is specific to one platform or another. You’ll find that figures are divided
into both platforms as well.
Often the commands given involve using the keyboard along with the mouse. For example,
“Press Shift while dragging with the Rectangular Marquee tool to create a square,” or
“Alt+click (Option+click) on the eyeball to redisplay all layers.”
When you see a command arrow (➪) in the text, it indicates that you should select a com-
mand from the menu bar. For example, “choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape” means to click
the Edit menu and then choose the Define Custom Shape option.
While this book has been written using Photoshop CS, you can still glean valuable info if you’re
using Version 6 or 7. It may take a little more time to understand how a palette or options
have changed, and of course, the topics covering new features won’t be applicable. But hey,
when you see the cool Version CS features, you may get the impetus you need to go out and
upgrade!

Icons Used in This Book
While perusing this book, you’ll notice some icons beckoning you for your attention. Don’t
ignore them; embrace them! These icons point out fun, useful, and memorable tidbits about
Photoshop, plus facts you’d be unwise to ignore.
This icon indicates information that makes your Photoshop experience easier. It also gives
you an icebreaker at your next cocktail party. Whipping out, “Did you know that pressing
the bracket keys enlarges or shrinks your brush tip?” is bound to make you the center of
conversation.
Seasoned users will appreciate this icon, which kindly points out new features introduced in
Photoshop CS.
This icon is a reminder of things that I already mentioned and want to gently re-emphasize.
Or I might be pointing out things that I want you to take note of in your future Photoshop

Fundamentals


A
s environments go, the Photoshop working environment
is pretty cool: as inviting as a landscaped backyard and
not nearly as likely to work you into a sweat. Each of the
many tools in Photoshop is custom-designed for a specific
chore and chock-full of more options than a Swiss Army knife.
When you’re familiar with your surroundings, you’ll be eager to
make like Monet in his garden, surrounded by palettes,
brushes, buckets of paint, and swatches of color, ready to
tackle the canvas in front of you.
Getting a Warm Welcome
When you launch Photoshop CS for the first time, you’re
greeted by Photoshop’s rendition of the friendly neighbor-
hood welcome wagon. The handy Welcome Screen, shown
in Figure 1-1, provides a virtual plethora of goodies for
everyone from the beginner to the advanced user. New
feature descriptions, tutorials, tips, tricks, and help with set-
ting up color management are all at your fingertips. Don’t
worry about exploring every item when you first launch
Photoshop. You can call up the Welcome Screen anytime
by choosing Help➪Welcome Screen. Some of the informa-
tion provided is in PDF (Portable Document Format)
format, which can be read in Adobe Acrobat Reader (a
free download from www.adobe.com). Other information
is available through links to the Adobe Web site. There’s
even a movie that details all the new features. So grab
some popcorn and enjoy.
If you prefer to access the Welcome Screen at your own leisure
and don’t want it to appear every time you launch Photoshop,
deselect the Show This Dialog at Startup option in the bottom-
left corner of the Welcome Screen window.

Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop
You start Photoshop just as you launch any other program under Windows or the Mac OS. As
with other programs, you can choose the method you find the easiest and most convenient.
Here’s a quick summary of your options:

Launch from the Windows Start menu. Windows PCs have a handy pop-up Programs
menu that includes your most frequently used applications. Just locate the program on
the menu and select it.

Launch from the Windows taskbar or Macintosh OS X Dock. You may have inserted
icons for your really mission-critical programs in these readily accessible launching
bars, usually found at the bottom (or sometimes sides) of your screen. Click the
Photoshop icon to start.

Launch Photoshop by double-clicking a shortcut or alias icon placed on your
desktop.

Double-click an image file associated with Photoshop. When you installed Photoshop,
the setup program let you specify which type of common image file types (.TIF, .PSD,
.PCX, and so forth) you wanted to be associated with (or linked to, for launching pur-
poses) Photoshop, ImageReady, or neither (Windows only). Double-clicking an icon,
shortcut, or alias representing the file type you chose launches Photoshop.
When you launch Photoshop, the desktop workspace, shown in Figure 1-2, appears. Like the
real-world desktop where your keyboard and monitor reside, the Photoshop desktop is a
place for you to put all the documents you’re working with.
The desktop consists of a main window, called the application window if you’re using Windows
(and called the document window if you’re using the Mac OS), which takes up the majority of
your screen by default. Within the main window, you see a variety of other windows and
boxes, such as the image document window that enables you to view and edit images.
Figure 1-1

Launching Photoshop and Customizing the Desktop
11
The main window contains the stuff you’re probably used to seeing in other programs — a
title bar at the top of the window, a status bar at the bottom (unless you have it turned off) if
you’re a Windows user, and menus to help you execute commands and get important informa-
tion about your image files. But the arrangement of controls may be a little unfamiliar to you.
Photoshop arranges controls into groups called palettes.
In Windows, borders mark the left and right edges of the Photoshop window — even if the
main application window’s contents fill up more than your screen can show.
Your virtual desktop can become as cluttered as the real thing, but Adobe has built in some
special features (located on the Options bar, which I discuss later in this chapter) that let you
keep stuff close at hand but tuck things away so they’re not constantly underfoot (or under-
mouse, so to speak). After you’ve arranged your Photoshop desktop just as you like it for a spe-
cific project, you can even save the desktop and reuse it whenever you work on that project.

Every document you ever work on appears within the confines of this window and can’t leave
its borders. You can move around some other components, such as the various palettes and
the Options bar, both inside and outside the Photoshop application window.
Windows users can close, minimize, and restore the main Photoshop window, just as you can
with most windows in other programs. Mac users can choose Photoshop➪Hide Photoshop.
To display Photoshop again, simply click the icon in the Dock.
The Photoshop window hides one cool secret for Windows users: If you double-click any-
where in the gray empty area, the Open dialog box pops up, so you can navigate to a file
you want to work on without wandering up to the File menu, using the Ctrl+O keyboard
shortcut, or using File Browser.
The following sections show you how to customize the main working area so that you can get
to work.
Setting display settings with the Window menu
The Window menu, shown in Figure 1-3, controls the display of palettes and some other ele-
ments of the Photoshop working area. (Find out more about maneuvering palettes later in this
chapter.)
The top two entries on the Window menu enable you to control the display arrangement of
your open documents and manage your workspaces. In the Window➪Arrange submenu, you
can tell Photoshop to cascade (stack) or tile (butt them edge to edge) all open documents.
Here is the lowdown on the other options found on the Window➪Arrange submenu:
The new Match Zoom command takes all your open documents and matches the magnifica-
tion percentage of your currently active document. 

The new Match Location command takes all your open documents and matches the
location of your currently active document. In other words, if you are viewing the lower-
left corner of your active document and choose Match location, all your open docu-
ments will also be displayed from the lower-left corner. 
If you’re serious about your graphics work, you
may consider purchasing a second monitor (and
video card if you don’t own a two head video
card that can operate a second display) to attach
to your main computer system. A second moni-
tor gives you additional monitor space to display
multiple large image files and palettes of
Photoshop tools. I often move stuff from screen
to screen to maximize the area on my main
screen for an image I’m working on.
If you have a dual-monitor setup, you can even
move components from one display screen to
another. Whether you’re using Mac or Windows
machines, whenever you want to use a tool that
appears on your secondary screen, you just slide
the mouse over to the alternate display and click.
In order to use a second monitor, your computer
must have Windows 2000 or later installed. Or
you should be running any recent Mac OS.


And of course, Match Zoom and Location employs both commands simultaneously.

Choose New Window to open another view of the same image, allowing you to work on
a close-up of part of the image while viewing results on the entire image. 

The Arrange Icons command (Windows only) takes minimized files and arranges the
title bar icons in a neat row directly above the status bar.

Minimize (Mac only) hides the image while placing the image’s thumbnail in the Dock.
Click the thumbnail to restore the image in Photoshop. 

If you have multiple applications launched and document windows open, the Bring All
to Front command (Mac only) will enable all Photoshop documents to come to the
front, ahead of any open document windows from other applications.
On the Window➪Workspace submenu, you can save your current desktop arrangement, load
or delete a stored arrangement, or reset your palette locations. For step-by-step instructions,
see Book I, Chapter 6. The remaining bulk of the Window menu contains a list of palettes in
alphabetical order.
Photoshop CS has eliminated the Window➪Documents menu. Consequently, you don’t have
to open a submenu to see a list of open documents. The list of all open documents is once
again shown at the bottom of the Window menu. Hallelujah!
Figure 1-3

Setting up the status bar
By default, the status bar appears at the bottom of the Photoshop working area in Windows,
as shown in Figure 1-4. If you’re using the Mac OS, each document window has its own status
bar.
On a PC, you can turn the status bar on or off by selecting it or deselecting it on the Window
menu.
Many people tend to associate status with wealth, so I don’t really think there’s a reason not
to accept the free wealth of information that the status bar offers:

At the far left is a box that displays an active image’s current zoom level (such as 66.67
percent). Incidentally, the title bar of the document itself also shows the zoom level.
If you installed Photoshop to a networked computer and you’ve activated the workgroup
features, which enable file sharing and other perks, you see the icon for the Workgroup
Services pop-up menu just to the right of the zoom info box.

Next is the file and image information display area, which, by default, shows the docu-
ment size information. You can customize this area to display other information. Click
the size value to display a preview of how your image fits on your selected paper size.

Because the good people at Adobe know just how complex a program Photoshop is,
next to the file and info display area of the status bar is a description of the currently
selected tool’s functions, as well as information on how to select additional options for
that tool. This extra tidbit will only be found on Windows machines, however.
Although each Macintosh document includes its own status bar, all the bars for all the open
documents show the same category of information. That is, if you change the status bar of
one image to display scratch sizes (defined a little later in this chapter), all the status bars of
the other document images switch to display scratch sizes, as well.
Because Photoshop files can get pretty hefty in size, your status bar shows the file size of the
active image by default. To display other types of information, click the right-pointing arrow in
the status bar and select one of the following options from the menu that pops up:

Document Size: When you select this option, Photoshop displays two numbers to
approximate the size of the image. The first number shows you the size of the file if
you were to flatten (combine) all the layers into one and save it to your hard drive.
The number on the right shows the full size of the image — including all the individual
layers, channels, and other components of the image. You’ll want this option active
when you need to keep track of how large your image is.

Document Profile: When you select this option, the status bar displays the name of the
color profile that the image uses. You probably won’t use this option unless you need to
know the profiles of all the open documents while making complex color corrections.
You can find more information about profiles in Book II, Chapter 3.
Figure 1-4

Dissecting Dialog Box Jargon
15

Document Dimensions: When you select this option, the status bar shows you the size
of the image by using the default measurement increment you’ve set in Photoshop’s
Preferences (pixels, inches, picas, and so on). You might need this for instant reference
to the physical dimensions of your open files. For information on setting preferences in
Photoshop, see Book I, Chapter 6.

Scratch Sizes: Scratch space is the virtual memory set aside on your hard drive to simu-
late RAM and make editing large files easier. Enabling this option shows two measure-
ments for an active image. On the left, you see the amount of real memory and virtual
memory that all open images are using. On the right, you see the total amount of RAM
available for working with images. Photoshop needs a lot more memory and disk space to
work on an image while it’s open, and that’s what’s shown by the Scratch Sizes display, as
opposed to the Document Size display that shows only the file size of the document itself.

Efficiency: This indicator helps you gauge whether you really have enough RAM to per-
form a task. It shows the percentage of time Photoshop spends actually working on an
operation, compared to the time it must spend reading or writing image information to
or from your hard disk. If the value dips below 100 percent most of the time, you need
to allocate more memory to Photoshop (if you’re using a PC). For more information on
parceling out RAM, see Book I, Chapter 6.

Timing: This number shows you how long it took you to complete your last incredible feat.

Current Tool: This option shows you the name of the tool currently in use. 
Dissecting Dialog Box Jargon
In many respects, the Photoshop dialog boxes are very much like the dialog boxes you find in
all other Windows and Mac applications. You’ll find text boxes with space to type in informa-
tion (such as the name of a new layer, or the width or height you want to apply to a new docu-
ment), pop-up menus of parameters you can choose from (such as whether you want the
width and height expressed in pixels, inches, millimeters, picas, or some other unit of meas-
urement), and controls like sliders that you use to specify amounts (in percentages, pixels, or
degrees) over a continuous range.
Some dialog boxes are very complex and perform multiple tasks. However, even though
Photoshop’s dialog boxes perform a variety of functions, the controls in them are standard-
ized and familiar enough that, after you know how to use a few dialog boxes, you can use
them all.
Photoshop dialog boxes, particularly filter dialog boxes, include preview windows so that you
can check out the effects of your settings before clicking the OK button. The Photoshop
Variations dialog box is one of the most complex of these. It includes a whole clutch of thumb-
nail images that show you the current image, plus several different renditions.
Dialog boxes generally appear when you choose a menu item followed by an ellipsis, such as
Load Selection . . . . The ellipsis is your tip-off that the menu selection needs additional infor-
mation to complete the operation. Dialog boxes can also pop up at other times, such as when
you double-click the Quick Mask icon in the Tools palette to produce the Quick Mask Options
dialog box, or double-click the www.adobe.com icon at the top of the Tools palette.

Book I  Chapter 1: Examining the Photoshop Environment
16
If you know how to work with other applications, you already know how to use most of the
controls in Photoshop dialog boxes. These include

Pop-up menus: Drop-down lists of choices that have been preselected for you.

Spin buttons: These are up-/down-arrow buttons that you click to increase or decrease
values quickly.

Text boxes: Areas in which you can type values of your own choosing.

Radio buttons: A set of mutually exclusive buttons; you can select only one of them,
such as the Inside, Center, or Outside radio button, which tells the Stroke dialog box
where to apply the stroke.

Check boxes: Boxes that you can select or deselect to turn a feature on or off, inde-
pendently of other features.

Slider controls: Controls for specifying any one of a continuous range of values.

Nested dialog boxes: Some dialog boxes include a button with text followed by an ellip-
sis, indicating that when you click the button, a new, sub-dialog box appears.

Action buttons: Labeled with text such as OK or Cancel, these buttons activate or
cancel an operation when you click them.
Playing with Palettes
Many image-oriented programs use palettes of a sort, and Photoshop itself has had palettes
since version 1.0, released in January of 1990. However, since Photoshop 3.0, the program has
used a novel way of working with palettes. Instead of stand-alone windows, Photoshop uses
grouped, tabbed palettes, which overlap each other in groups of two or three (or more, if you
rearrange them yourself). To access a palette that falls behind the one displayed on top, click
the palette’s tab. By default, some palettes, such as Brushes, Info, Layer Comps, and Tool
Presets, appear alone.
Palettes operate a little like dialog boxes and may contain sliders, buttons, drop-down lists,
pop-up menus (as shown in Figure 1-5), and other controls. You’ll also find icons at the bottom
of many palettes. For example, at the base of the Layers palette are icons that let you create a
new layer, add a layer style, or trash a layer that you no longer want.
Some palettes can change like chameleons. The Actions palette can be displayed in Button
mode, in which you see only the name of each set of procedures you might want to invoke. Or
you can flip the Actions palette to Normal mode, which lists each of the procedures in the
action separately for you to view or edit.
Many palettes, such as the Brushes, Styles, Actions, and Colors palettes, include options for
defining sets of parameters (called presets) that you can store for reuse at any time.

Playing with Palettes
17
Here’s how to open, close, and otherwise manipulate a palette group from the Window menu:

To bring a palette to the front of its group: When the palette group is open, the palette
that’s visible is the palette that has a check mark next to it on the Window menu. In this
mode, you can select only one palette in any group because only one tab in a group can
be on top at one time.
When you select a palette from the Window menu, you have no way of knowing which
palettes are grouped together because Adobe now lists palettes alphabetically instead of by
groups.

To move a palette out of its group: Grab the palette’s tab and drag to its new location,
such as another group, the Palette Well, or the Photoshop desktop. If you move the
palettes out of their groups or drag them onto the desktop so that they stand alone, any
of them can be check marked.

To hide a palette: Select a check-marked palette on the Window menu or click the Close
button at the top of the palette.

To access a palette from the desktop: Find its group and click the palette’s tab to bring
it to the front.
Here are some palette-manipulation tips:

Save space by keeping palettes in groups. You can drag all the palettes in a group by
dragging the group’s title bar. Access an individual palette by clicking its tab to bring it
to the front. As a result, several palettes occupy only the screen space required by one.

Use the Window menu if you can’t find a palette. If you can’t find a palette or suspect
that it’s hidden, access the Window menu and select the palette’s name to make it visi-
ble or to bring it to the top of its group.

Rearrange groups by dragging. If you’d like to move a palette to another group or to dis-
play it as a stand-alone palette, grab its tab and drag. Release the mouse button where
you’d like the palette to reside in the workspace, or in the destination palette group.
Figure 1-5

Book I  Chapter 1: Examining the Photoshop Environment
18

Customize, customize, customize. After you’ve used Photoshop for a while, creating
your own custom palette groups based on the palettes you most often use can be a real
time saver. For example, if you don’t use the Paths palette very often but can’t live with-
out the Actions palette, you can drag the Paths palette to another group or the Palette
Well and put the Actions palette in the same group as the mission-critical Layers and
Channels palettes.

Minimize palettes to save even more space. You can double-click a palette’s title bar
(or tab if you’re using the Mac OS) to shrink the palette or palette group down to its
title bar and tabs alone. You can also click the Minimize button at the top of palette.

Restore default palette locations whenever you need a change. If you decide you
don’t like the way you’ve arranged your palettes, you can choose Window➪Workspace➪
Reset Palette Locations to return them to the default configuration (the one they had
when Photoshop was installed).
Some individual palettes, such as the Swatches and Character palettes, allow you to reset the
settings back to their defaults. Select Reset from the palette’s pop-up menu located in the
top-right corner.
Working with Your First Photoshop File
So many menus, so little time! The second you begin working with Photoshop, you may be
convinced that Adobe’s flagship image editor has somewhere on the order of 8,192 different
menu selections for you to choose from. In truth, Photoshop has only about 500-plus separate
menu items, including some that are duplicated. That figure doesn’t count the 100 or so
entries for filter plug-ins (which can expand alarmingly as you add third-party goodies).
However, even 500-plus menu items are considerably more than you’ll find in the most ambi-
tious restaurants. Basically, if you want to do something in Photoshop, you need to use the
menu bar. The menu bar consists of nine main entries, each of which holds a dozen or more
nested subentries and sub-subentries that cascade into view as you drag the cursor down the
list. If you’re using the Mac OS, the Photoshop menu bar may share space with Finder compo-
nents, such as the Apple menu or the Clock.
You’ll find pop-up menus everywhere, next to icons on the Options bar, on menus that fly out
from palettes, in the status bar, and especially in the menu bar. You can find detailed descrip-
tions of the menus and how to use them elsewhere in this book, but the following sections
offer a summary of what you can find and where you can find it.
Photoshop also helps you by providing context-sensitive menus, which change their listings
depending on what you’re doing. You don’t see options you don’t need and do see options
appropriate to what you’re working on.
Opening and saving files
The File menu offers a cornucopia of file options, from opening new images and opening saved
files to browsing existing files, closing files, and saving files. The first layer of file options is
shown in Figure 1-6.

Working with Your First Photoshop File
19
You can edit a file in ImageReady, save a file optimized for the Web, import and export special
file types, grab an image from your scanner or digital camera, and apply automated tasks to cer-
tain files or batches of files. You can even enter or retrieve specialized information about a file.
You’ll find the page setup, preview, and printing commands on the File menu. And on a PC,
there’s even an entry for leaving Photoshop entirely (Mac users can find the Quit command
on the Photoshop menu). To open a file, choose File➪Open and navigate to the folder contain-
ing the file you want to open. Select the file and click OK to open it.
Choose Online Services to access Adobe partners and providers offering a variety of services
such as ordering prints, photo books, and calendars.
For detailed instructions on all the many different ways you can open files, see Book I,
Chapter 3.

Making selections
Selections let you work with only part of an image. You can choose all of a layer or only por-
tions of a layer that you select with one of the selection tools, such as the Marquee or Magic
Wand. The Select menu (shown in Figure 1-7) is short and sweet, but the capability and con-
trol that the menu unleashes is nothing short of an image-editing miracle.
Understanding selections is such an important cornerstone to your Photoshop knowledge
that I devote an entire book (Book III) to showing you how to use them.
I describe the Selection menu options in Table 1-1.

Another important capability is the option of saving selections and loading them later for
reuse. As you find out in Book VI, not only can you load a selection you’ve already made, but
you can also subtract the saved selection from another selection or add it to another new or
saved selection.
To save a selection, choose Select➪Save Selection. In the Save Selection dialog box that
appears, type a name for the selection and click OK.
Making simple image edits
The Edit menu, shown in Figure 1-8, contains tools that enable you to cut, copy, or paste
image selections in several different ways. You can fill selections or stroke their outlines
(create a line along their edges). And you can use this menu to rotate, resize, distort, or per-
form other transformations (changes in size or shape) on your selections. You can undo the
change you made in Photoshop, fade a filter, check your spelling, or find and replace text.
The Edit menu also offers some choices that may not logically belong here but which don’t fit
anywhere else. For example, you can define brushes, patterns, and shapes. You can clear the
Photoshop clipboard, dump Photoshop’s list of the changes you’ve made, and establish your
color management settings and tool presets. On a PC, you also access Photoshop’s Preferences
(your personal settings for things such as memory, how cursors look, and so on) from the Edit
menu. You find out more about preferences in Book I, Chapter 6.
Mac users will find Color Settings and Preferences located on the Photoshop menu. For
details on establishing your color settings, see Book II, Chapter 2.

Book I  Chapter 1: Examining the Photoshop Environment
22
You’ll also find a new command that allows you to customize your own set of keyboard
shortcuts. For more details, see Book I, Chapter 6.
Making changes by using the Image menu
You’d think the Image menu (shown in Figure 1-9) might have something to do with making
changes to an image document as a whole, wouldn’t you? In practice, some of the entries
you’ll find here do apply to the whole document, but others apply only to particular layers or
selections.
For example, the Mode menu item allows you to change an entire image from grayscale to
color. The Duplicate, Image Size, Canvas Size, Rotate Canvas, Crop, and Trim selections all
change the whole document in some way. (Their functions are obvious from their names,
except for Trim, which removes pixels from the edge of an image.)
A new command on the Image menu is Pixel Aspect Ratio. This command allows you to
view your image in common digital video aspect ratios that aren’t square (such as 16:9),
thereby simulating the display of the image on a device that uses non-square pixels, such as
a movie screen or a wide-screen TV.
Figure 1-8

Working with Your First Photoshop File
23
On the other hand, the changes wrought from the Adjustments submenu can’t be applied to an
entire image if the document has more than one layer. Adjustments such as Color Balance,
Hue/Saturation, or Brightness/Contrast work only with a single layer or a selection on that layer.
You’ll find yourself turning to the Image menu more often than many of the other menus, par-
tially because it’s so useful, and partially because, for some reason, many of the options don’t
have keyboard shortcuts that let you bypass the menu.
By the way, Adobe removed the Histogram option from the Image menu in favor of its own
palette. For details on this new palette, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
Creating layers
Layers give you a way of stacking portions of an image — overlay style — on top of one
another so that you can work on individual pieces separately. Then, when you’re satisfied
with your changes, you can combine the changes into a final image.
The Photoshop Layers feature, which gets an entire book of its own (Book V), is so useful it’s
hard to imagine that it hasn’t always been present in Photoshop. (Thank your lucky stars if
you didn’t have to use versions of Photoshop that preceded version 3.0.) Those of us who
worked with Photoshop 2.5 and earlier still wake up from nightmares in which a floating selec-
tion (the predecessor to the layer feature) permanently merged with the background because
of an ill-timed sneeze.
The Layer menu in Photoshop CS (shown in Figure 1-10) lets you create new and duplicate
layers, delete one or several layers, change layer properties (such as a layer’s name), or add
special features, such as drop shadows or beveled edges, to objects in a layer. You can also
create special kinds of layers to make adjustments or mask out portions of an image. The menu
has selections for changing the order of the layers (moving a specific layer to the front or top
of the stack, and so on) and grouping layers together so that you can treat them as a set.
Figure 1-9
Book
I
Chapter
1

Book I  Chapter 1: Examining the Photoshop Environment
24
You also can merge layers down, combine them with all other visible layers, or flatten them
into one single-layer image. Although merging your layers makes the file smaller, flattening is
irreversible after you close the file. It’s always a good idea to store an unflattened version of a
file in case you want to make more changes later on.
Photoshop has two key layer facilities, the Layer menu and the Layers palette. Some of their
functions are duplicated, but some are not, so make sure you’re using both of them. You find
out the distinctions in Book V.
The latest member of the layers family is the Layer Comps palette. This palette enables you
to capture different versions of your document by recording the configuration of your layers
at a point in time. Again, for all the pertinent details on layers, see Book V.
Applying filters
A filter is an effect that changes an entire layer, channel, or selection. Some common filters
include the Blur and Sharpen filters as well as distortion filters such as Spherize. The Filter menu,
Figure 1-10

Working with Your First Photoshop File
25
shown in Figure 1-11, consists almost entirely of cascading categories of image-transmogrifying
plug-ins. You can wade through this menu to find the perfect effect to apply to an image or selec-
tion. Book VII has everything you need to know about filters.
After you apply a filter, Photoshop moves the filter to the top of the Filter menu for easy
accessibility in case you want to reapply the filter with the exact same settings.
The new Filter Gallery command allows you to apply several filters simultaneously in one
neat editing window. 
To choose the last filter you used, use the Ctrl+F (Ô+F on the Mac) keyboard shortcut.
Extract, Liquify, and Pattern Maker are more like miniprograms than filters. The rest of the
Filter menu consists of 14 different filter categories, each containing from zero to a dozen or
more options:

Single-step filters are pretty basic to use but can make a huge impact on an image.
These include simple filters such as the Blur, Facet, and Clouds filters. Just click each
filter to apply it; it has no options to choose.

Dialog box-based filters let you choose options galore. These filters come complete with
preview windows, buttons, slider controls, and menus. You can distort, pixelate,
sharpen, stylize, apply textures, and perform other functions with these filters.
Figure 1-11
Book
I
Chapter

Book I  Chapter 1: Examining the Photoshop Environment
26
If you’ve installed additional filters from third parties, Photoshop lists them at the very
bottom of the Filter menu. You can find third-party filters at Web sites such as www.
alienskin.com, www.andromeda.com, and www.autofx.com.
Simplifying your edits with the Options bar
The Options bar, shown in Figure 1-12, was a welcomed addition to Photoshop because it elim-
inated the need to access a separate options palette for each tool. The bar remains available
at all times, docked beneath the menu bar (unless you decide to hide it for some bizarre
reason), and the options change as you switch tools. 
Because the Options bar changes its appearance with each active tool, it’s difficult to explain all
the components you might find there; but every Options bar does have some characteristics in
common:

Gripper bar: Grab this bar and drag to undock or dock the Options bar at the top or
bottom of the Photoshop window. You can also let the Options bar float anywhere in the
working space.

Tool options: This box displays the icon of the currently active tool and may include
some options for that tool.

Options pop-up menu: The Options bar may have a pop-up menu that includes a selec-
tion of brush tips (for painting and erasing tools), a flyout-type options menu that lets
you select presets (saved settings) for various tools, and additional options, such as the
size of the icons used to represent brush tips. You may also reset a particular tool or all
tools to their Photoshop default values.

Bar options: Additional options, such as mode, opacity, feather, type styles, and fonts
are arrayed on the rest of the Options bar.

File Browser button: The File Browser button (a folder with magnifying glass icon)
allows you to display and hide the File Browser window with a mere click. See Book I,
Chapter 5 for lots of details.
The File Browser button is a new member to the Options bar.

Palette Well: If your monitor has a screen resolution higher than 800 x 600 pixels, the
Palette Well appears at the right side of the Options bar. You can drag palettes from
their groups into the Palette Well, where only their tabs appear. Click the tab, and the
palette appears, ready for use. When you click again in your document, the palette
shrinks down to its tab. The Palette Well is a great tool for keeping your frequently used
palettes accessible. I like to keep some palettes, particularly the Layers and Channels
palettes, open in the workspace at all times, but some others (such as the Swatches or
Styles palettes) don’t need to be visible on-screen at all times.

Proofing and finalizing the image
A hodgepodge of functions is sprinkled throughout the View menu, shown in Figure 1-13.
Some of them, like Proof Setup, Proof Colors, and Gamut Warning, won’t trouble you until
you’ve become a fairly advanced Photoshop user.
If you prefer using the View menu instead of the Zoom tool, you’ll find various commands to
zoom into and out of the image. You can also choose your screen mode, which lets you view
your image full screen with the menu bar and palettes, or full screen with just palettes.
From the View menu, you can select which extras Photoshop displays. You can choose to see
(or hide) the following:

Selection Edges: Moving lines that define the boundary of a selection and are very
useful for obvious reasons.

Target Path: Lines and curves that define a shape or are used to select part of an image.
You definitely want to see them if they need editing.

Grids and Guides: Lines that display on screen and are great when you’re aligning
selections, objects, or other components, and potentially distracting when you’re not.
Figure 1-13
Book
I

Book I  Chapter 1: Examining the Photoshop Environment


Slices: Rectangular pieces of an image to which you can optimize or apply Web features.
If you’ve sliced the image, you probably want to view the results.

Annotations: On-screen notes and audio annotations that you can create and view (or
play). Annotations can sometimes be confusing, unless you’re already confused; then
annotations can help you sort out what’s what.
The View menu holds the controls for turning on and off the snap feature in Photoshop. (The
snap feature makes objects magnetically attracted to grids and guides.) You can also create
new guides, lock and clear slices (see Book IX, Chapter 3, for slice-and-dice information), and
turn rulers on or off.
Some functions, especially the zoom features, are better accessed through tools or keyboard
shortcuts. Trust me, when you’ve learned to zoom in and out by pressing Ctrl++ (Ô++ [plus
sign] on the Mac) and Ctrl+– (Ô+–[minus sign] on the Mac), you won’t be spending a lot of
time in this menu searching for those functions.
Accessing Help When You Need It
To access the Photoshop Help system, plus some other useful information, look no further
than the handy-dandy Help menu, as shown in Figure 1-14.
If you’re using the Mac OS, the Help menu also lets you turn Balloon Help on and off.
Because you can view the Help screens (they pop up in a Web browser window) simply by
pressing F1 (or Ô+? on the Mac), you may not visit the Help menu very often, but if you ever
want to find all your help resources in one location, this is the place to be. Here are some
other help sources:

The Welcome Screen allows you to access valuable tips and tutorials.
See the earlier section, “Getting a Warm Welcome,” that describes this new feature.
Figure 1-14

Accessing Help When You Need It
29

The About Photoshop splash screen displays the version number of your Photoshop
program. That way you’ll always know if you’ve installed the latest patches and updates
to Photoshop CS.

The About Plug-In entry displays a list of all the plug-ins you’ve installed for Photoshop.
Selecting an item in the list shows an About screen of version information for that plug-in.
On a Mac, both the About Photoshop splash screen and About Plug-In menu are on the
Photoshop menu.

The Export Transparent Image and Resize Image choices launch a wizard (assistant on
the Mac) that leads you step by step through all the decisions you need to make to
create an image that includes transparency. For example, you might want to create
some text in Photoshop and then have it appear to “float” above your Web page’s back-
ground. The Resize Image Wizard (Assistant on the Mac) leads you through adjusting
the image size so the document will print at the size you want.

The System Info entry displays information about your computer, its operating system,
and available memory, plus Photoshop-specific data such as the location you set for
your Plug-Ins folder. If you like, you can click the Copy button to copy this information
to the clipboard, and then paste it in a text document and print it out.

The Updates, Registration, and Photoshop Online choices access Internet resources for
Photoshop.

A
fter you have a good grasp of the overall Photoshop envi-
ronment (described in Book I, Chapter 1), you’re ready to
dive into the cache of gadgets that, along with the menus
and palettes and dialog boxes, make it all happen. Just as you
can use a saw, hammer, and nails to transform a pile of 2 x 4s
into a garden gazebo, you can use the Lasso tool, Healing
Brush, and Smudge tool to convert a mediocre photo into a
masterpiece fit to be framed. But remember, behind every
garden gazebo is a carpenter who knew how to use the tools
required to build it.
Turning On the Tools Palette
You can access the Tools palette — or Toolbox as it is often
affectionately called — by choosing Window➪Tools. Here are a
few tips for using the Toolbox:

To quickly hide and show the Tools palette (along with
the other palettes), press the Tab key.

To collapse the Tools palette, double-click the title bar
above the feather icon at the top.

To move the Tools palette anywhere within the
Photoshop window, drag the title bar above the feather
icon.
Selecting tools
To select a tool, simply click it in the Tools palette. A small
black triangle in the bottom-right corner of a tool slot indicates
that more tools are hidden behind that tool on a flyout menu. To
display the flyout menu and reveal the hidden tools, click and
hold down the mouse button on the tool. Then drag to the right
and down the column of tools, highlight the tool you want, and
release your mouse button.

You can also access tools by using keyboard shortcuts (which are listed in Figure 2-1):

Selecting visible tools: You can access the visible tools by pressing a single key on the
keyboard. For example, to select the Move tool, press the V key; to select the Brush
tool, press the B key.

Selecting hidden tools: For the most part, you can access a hidden tool by pressing the
Shift key along with the keyboard letter of the visible tool. For example, to select the
Pencil tool, which shares the flyout menu with the Brush tool, press Shift+B.
Photoshop has a couple of exceptions, however. You can press Shift+M to switch
between the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee tools, but you can’t access the Single
Column and Single Row marquee tools. Press Shift+P to cycle through the Pen and the
Freeform Pen; however, the remaining tools — the Add Anchor Point tool, Delete
Anchor Point tool, and Convert Point tool — do not have keyboard shortcuts.
You can adjust your preferences if you decide that you don’t like having to press the Shift
key to access a hidden tool. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪
General in Mac OS X) and deselect the option Use Shift Key for Tool Switch. You can then
rotate through the tools by pressing the same letter repeatedly.
You can also Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) on a tool to cycle through all the tools
hidden beneath it. The only exceptions are the Marquee tools and the Pen tools; some of the
tools on their flyout menus aren’t accessible this way.

When you hover your mouse over a tool, color control, or icon, you see a tool tip. The tool tip
tells you the name of the tool or icon and its keyboard shortcut, if any. This feature is helpful
when you first start working in Photoshop, but if it gets annoying after a while, feel free to
turn it off. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Photoshop➪Preferences in Mac OS X) and deselect the
Show Tool Tips option in the General Preferences dialog box.
If you try to use a tool and all you see is the Cancel or No (the circle with a diagonal line) icon,
click the image. Photoshop politely informs you why it isn’t allowing you to use the tool. For
example, if you try to apply color with the Brush tool on a shape layer, you get a message that
you can’t use the Brush because the content of the layer can’t be edited with that particular
tool.
Getting to know your tools
The Tools palette is divided into three basic sections: tools, color swatches, and icons for
masking modes and viewing options. The next several sections introduce you to the tools.
The following list details the other residents of the Tools palette, shown in Figure 2-2:

Foreground Color and Background Color: Color swatches represent the current fore-
ground and background colors. When using some of the tools, such as the Brush or Pencil,
you may apply either of these colors. The small black and white swatches represent the
default colors of a black foreground and white background. Click the Default Colors icon to
reset the colors to the default. Click the curved arrow icon to switch the foreground and
background colors. For everything you need to know on color, see Book II, Chapter 3.

Edit in Standard Mode and Edit in Quick Mask Mode: The first set of icons allows you
to work in either Standard mode or Quick Mask mode. For now leave the mode set to
Standard. Quick Masks, which offer a way to view, make, and edit a selection, are covered
in detail in Book VI, Chapter 2.

Standard Screen Mode: The default setting, this mode enables you to see your entire
Photoshop desktop.

Full Screen Mode with Menu Bar: This mode hides your desktop background and other
open images.

Full Screen Mode: Use this mode to hide your desktop background, any open images,
and the menu bar. In addition, the Photoshop window turns to black.
You can now move an image even when it is in Full Screen Mode.

Edit in ImageReady: When you click the bottom-most icon, you launch Photoshop’s
sister program, ImageReady, a Web graphics program. Check out Book IX, Chapter 5, for
more on ImageReady.

Go to the Photoshop and ImageReady area of www.adobe.com: If you click the feather
icon at the top of the Toolbox (refer to Figure 2-1), you are transported to the
Photoshop product area of the Adobe Web site. This site is loaded with tons of great
info, such as tips, tech support, upgrades, and news on products and events.

Introducing the Photoshop Tools
I’m just giving you a very brief description of what each tool does. You’ll be more thoroughly
initiated with the use of each of the tools as you go through the book. Don’t want to go page
by page through the book? Okay. Well, you’re in luck; I also give you the exact spot where you
will find more on each of the tools. For what it’s worth, I have organized the tools into logical
groupings, although some can cross over into other groups and some are unique enough that
they don’t really fit well in any group. For a great visual reference of what each tool does, be
sure and check out Appendix B.
Using selection tools
The selection tools, shown in Table 2-1, are the workhorses of Photoshop. They allow you to
capture and isolate pixels so that you can edit or manipulate just a portion of an image.
Marquee tools capture rectangular, elliptical (see the results of the Elliptical Marquee tool in
Figure 2-3), or single rows or columns of pixels. Whereas the Lasso tools make freeform selec-
tions, the Magic Wand tool creates selections by picking up pixels of similar colors. And the
Move and Crop tools do just what their names describe — move and crop images. (Figure 2-4
shows the results of the Move tool.)

Creating and modifying paths
The path tools, shown in Table 2-2, create and modify paths, which are elements comprised of
straight and curved segments and anchor points. You can then use these paths as a basis for
a selection or to define a shape. Because of their precision, using path tools to ultimately
create a difficult selection usually yields better results than you can achieve with the selection
tools. Figures 2-5 and 2-6 show examples of using the Pen tool and Direct Selection tool,
respectively.

Using painting tools
The painting tools, in general, allow you to apply color or erase pixels. In the case of the
Gradient tool, you can apply multiple colors simultaneously. And with the Art History Brush
tool, you paint on a stylized effect rather than color. All the painting tools rely on the Brushes
palette for the size, shape, texture, and angle for the tip of the tool. See Table 2-3 for a list of
the painting tools.
Figure 2-7 shows examples of what you can do with the Brush tool. An example of the effects
of using the Eraser tool is shown in Figure 2-8.

Using tools for cloning and retouching
The cloning and retouching tools, shown in Table 2-4, are the powerhouse tools to break out
when you need to do some image repair work. These tools allow you to duplicate portions of
your image, paint with a pattern, or seamlessly fix scratches, wrinkles, and other blemishes.
The unique History Brush tool lets you actually paint a previous version of your image back
into your current image — perfect for undoing mistakes or repairing edits that went awry. The
new Color Replacement tool lets you replace the color of your image with the foreground
color. Figures 2-9 and 2-10 show examples of using the Clone Stamp tool and Pattern Stamp
tool, respectively.

The type tools, shown in Table 2-5, pretty much do as their moniker suggests — create type of
varying sorts. The Horizontal Type tool (Figure 2-11 shows text created using it) and Vertical
Type tool create regular old type, whereas the Mask Type tools create selections in the shape
of letters, which can then be filled with images. Figure 2-12 shows text created using the
Horizontal Type Mask tool.

Using focus and toning tools
The focus and toning tools, shown in Table 2-6, allow you to enhance your image by altering
the pixels in various ways. You can lighten, darken, blur, smudge (see Figure 2-13), sharpen,
saturate, or desaturate color in selective portions of your image. These tools work best for
touching up smaller areas rather than the entire image. For example, I used the Burn tool to
darken the pixels in the groom’s face shown in Figure 2-14. Hopefully he doesn’t take it
personally.

Creating shapes
The Shape tools, shown in Table 2-7, allow you to create vector-based elements in your image.
Depending on the mode selected, these elements are automatically filled with the foreground
color or left as just an empty path. The beauty of vector-based elements is that they are reso-
lution independent, meaning that they always print at the resolution of the output device
rather than the resolution of the image. Vector-based shapes created with the Shape tools
can also be resized and transformed without any quality degradation, unlike raster images.
Although vector-based elements are the heart and soul of the Shape tools, you can also create
shapes filled with pixels of the foreground color. For more on resolution, see Book II, Chapter 1.
Figures 2-15 and 2-16 show the Polygon and Custom Shape tools, respectively, in action.

Viewing, navigating, sampling, and annotating tools
Photoshop has an abundance of tools to help you view and navigate your image window.
These tools allow you to zoom in (as shown in Figure 2-17) and out, move your image within
the window, and measure distances and angles. The Eyedropper and Color Sampler tools let
you pick up and sample color respectively — handy for grabbing or evaluating color in an
image. The Notes tool (shown in Figure 2-18) and Audio Annotation tool create written and

Using tools for the Web
Photoshop doesn’t have a whole lot of tools dedicated to the preparation of Web images
(though it does have quite a few commands). That’s mainly because its companion program,
ImageReady, takes up the slack in that department. You will find the Slice tool and Slice Select
tool (shown in Figure 2-19), which allow you to create and select slices, or rectangular sections,
from an image. You can then optimize, and apply Web features like rollovers and image maps,
to those slices separately for the best viewing experience on your Web page. See Table 2-9.

Saving Time with Tool Presets
Tool presets enable you to create tool settings that you can save and use again. This feature is
a real time-saver if you use specific tool settings on a frequent basis. For example, I make
numerous 2-x-2-inch and 2-x-3-inch rectangular selections on images I use in a newsletter.
Because I saved the settings as presets, I don’t have to redefine them each time I want to
select an image for my project.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Creating custom tool presets
Here are the short and simple steps for creating your own custom tool preset:
1.
Choose a tool.
Most tools are fair game. If a tool 
doesn’t allow for presets, such as the
Measure tool for example, the Tool
Preset picker button (described in
Step 3) is grayed out.
2.
Select the option you want for the tool
in the Options bar.
3.
Click the Tool Preset picker button
in the Options bar, as shown in
Figure 2-20.
You can also choose Window➪Tool
Presets to bring up the Tool Presets
palette. The Tool Presets palette offers
an additional handy icon at the bottom
of the palette: the trash icon. This icon
lets you delete a preset quickly. Select
the preset and click the trash icon or
simply drag the preset to the trash.
You can’t create a new preset from
the Preset Manager, which is acces-
sible from the Tool Preset picker 
pop-up menu or by choosing Edit➪
Preset Manager. You can only load pre-
sets, as described in Step 6.
4.
Click the Create New Tool Preset
picker button (the dog-eared page
icon), or if you’re using the Tool
Presets palette, choose New Tool
Preset from the palette menu.
5.
Name the preset and click OK.
Your new preset is now saved and
ready for reuse.
6.
To select the tool preset, you can do
one of three things:
 Click the Tool Preset picker button
and select a preset from the picker
pop-up menu.
 Select a preset in the Tool Presets
palette.
 Select a preset in the Preset
Manager. Choose Tools from the
pop-up menu and select your preset.

A
lthough you can create some interesting images from
scratch in Photoshop, most of the time you’ll be working
with digital pictures that already exist. These may be
images captured by your scanner, photos you’ve grabbed with
your digital camera, or snapshots stored on a Kodak Photo CD.
Photoshop offers you lots of different options for opening exist-
ing images, creating new images, and saving changes to your
hard drive. This chapter takes you through the steps you need
to know to begin working with your images.
If you want to capture an image with your scanner or import a
photograph from your digital camera, opening such a digital
image may involve a little more than just using the file naviga-
tion tools built into Windows Explorer or the Mac OS Finder.
Check out Appendix A for a complete discussion.
Browsing for Files
If you don’t know the exact filename of the image you want to
open or can’t remember its location, you can use the Photoshop
File Browser to search for and open files. (Check out Book I,
Chapter 5 for a complete description of the File Browser.)
Finding a file is about as easy as you might expect: Choose
File➪Browse, or press Shift+Ctrl+O (Shift+Ô+O on the Mac).
Guess what! The File Browser window opens.
Now you can also just click the new File Browser button,
which looks like a folder & magnifying glass, and is on the
right side of the Options bar.

To navigate to a folder you’d like to search, use the folder tree in the upper-left corner of the
window. Click an image to see it in the Preview window (which shows up on the left side of the
File Browser). Photoshop graciously provides information about the file on the Metadata
palette below the preview.
When you find a file you’re sure you want to open, double-click it, or choose File➪Open on the
Browser menu, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Opening an Image
If you know exactly where an image file is stored, you can open the file in a similar way to
opening a word processing, spreadsheet, or other file; the default Open dialog boxes resemble
those that you find in most other applications. (I discuss other file-opening options in the fol-
lowing sections.)
Follow these steps to open a file:
Figure 3-1

Choose File➪Open, or press Ctrl+O
(Ô+O on the Mac).
The standard Open dialog box for
Windows or the Mac OS appears. The
layout of the dialog box differs slightly
between the two operating systems,

Windows taskbar where you can add fre-
quently used folders. It also sports a Find
button in the Open dialog box for those
hard-to-locate files.
From the Files of Type list (Windows)
or Show list (Mac OS), you can choose
which types of files you want displayed.
To view all image files, choose All Formats
(Windows) or All Readable Documents
(Mac OS).
c Click the name of the image file you
want to open.
To select multiple files, click the first
file and then Ctrl+click (Ô+click in Mac
OS X) each additional file.
You may see a preview of the image in
the dialog box’s Preview window. 
4.
After you select the file you want,
click the Open button.
The file opens in Photoshop.
If you choose File➪Open Recent, a sub-
menu lists the last files you worked on.
Click a filename to open it or simply

Opening special files
Photoshop needs to know the image format of a file (that is, whether it’s a TIFF, PCX, PSD, or
JPEG file, for example) before it can open the file. Photoshop uses different methods in
Windows and Mac OS to determine the format of an image file:

In Windows, Photoshop looks at the file extension (.tif, .pcx, .psd, and so forth), and
if it finds a standard image format extension, it assumes that the file was saved using
that format.

The Mac OS X uses a similar system based on filename extensions. The difference is that
the file extensions may or may not be hidden. Showing or hiding file extensions can be
accomplished via any file’s “Info” dialog. Select the file in the Mac OS X Finder, press Ô+I,
and the Info dialog pops up. Here you can show or hide the extension for that file, and
change what application is associated with that file (and all files with the same extension). 
For compatibility reasons, Macintosh applications like Photoshop usually use the Windows
file extension. However, when you move files from one platform to the other, they can easily be
misidentified. With Photoshop’s Open As feature, you can specify the format you think (or know)
that a given file uses. This facility works slightly differently in Windows than in the Mac OS.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼

Opening a Photo CD image
The Eastman Kodak Company originally developed the Photo CD format more than a decade
ago. It has become a popular image format option because of its flexibility and high quality.
Photo CDs store each image in multiple versions as Image Pacs, so you can open the version
that has the resolution you need. Professional versions of this format provide copy protection
and other features that professional photographers need. Your photofinisher can save your
images to a CD in Photo CD format for you; Photoshop can’t save in this format, however.

Placing Files
In Photoshop, you use the File➪Place command to put PDF (Portable Document Format),
Adobe Illustrator (AI), or EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files into a layer of their own. These
3

Figure 3-5

Placing Files
57
files are often created by programs other than Photoshop, such as Adobe Acrobat, Adobe
Illustrator, or CorelDRAW. Although Photoshop can open these files independently, you must
use the Place feature if you want to combine them with an existing image.
Follow these steps to place a PDF, Adobe Illustrator, or EPS file:
Book
I
Chapter

1.
Open an existing document into
which you want to place a file.
2.
Choose File➪Place.
The Place dialog box opens.
3.
Navigate to the file you want to insert
and then double-click the file.
For some types of files, such as multi-
page PDF files, you may see a dialog
box like the one shown in Figure 3-6,
which lets you specify which page you
would like to place.
Your image appears in a bounding box
in the center of your Photoshop image.
4.
You can reposition the artwork by
positioning your cursor inside the
bounding box and dragging. You can
also transform (size, rotate and so on)
your placed artwork if desired by
dragging or rotating the handles on
the bounding box or by entering
values in the Options bar.
Be careful, however. If you enlarge your
placed image too much, you may degrade
the quality of your image. For more infor-
mation on transforming images, see Book
III, Chapter 3.
Note that when you place a file, you
cannot edit the text or vector artwork in
it. Why? Because Photoshop rasterizes
the file, using the resolution of the file
into which you placed it. Note too that
when art is larger than the Photoshop
image, Photoshop downsizes the art so
that it fits the image. See Book II,
Chapter 1, for more on resolution.
5.
Choose Anti-Alias in the Options bar
if you want to soften the edges of the
artwork during rasterization.
Not choosing the option produces a
hard edge.
6.
Double-click inside the bounding box
to commit the placed image to a new
layer. You can also press Enter
(Return on the Mac) or click the
Commit button (the check icon) in the
Options bar.

Creating a New Image
At some point, you’ll want to create a new image from scratch. You may want an empty canvas
to paint on or need a blank image as scratch space. Or you may want to paste a copied selec-
tion into a new document.
Follow these steps to use the New feature to create a new image:
1.
Choose File➪New or press Ctrl+N
(Ô+N on the Mac).
The New dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 3-7.
If you copy a selection to the Clipboard
and then choose File➪New, Photoshop
automatically selects the Clipboard preset
and enters the dimensions of the copied
selection as the width and height of the
new document. You can create the new,
empty document and then paste the
copied selection into it by pressing Ctrl+V
(Ô+V on the Mac).
2.
Type in a name for the new file.
If you specify no name, Photoshop cre-
ates one for you, such as Untitled-1,
Untitled-2, and so forth.
c Enter the width and height of your
image by using one of the following
methods:
 Enter the width and height manu-
ally. Type the width and height of
your choice in the text boxes. The
Preset size will automatically revert
to Custom.
Note that now when you change the units
for either the width or height, the other
also changes. Hold down the Shift key
to change both width and height
independently.
 Choose a preset size from the Preset
drop-down list. The document sizes
include Default Photoshop Size;
common printing sizes such as 4 x 6,
5 x 7, or 8 x 10 inches; display
screen sizes such as 640 x 480 pixels
or 800 x 600 pixels; digital video sizes;
plus an array of other popular sizes.
Photoshop CS has a couple new presets.
The Clipboard provides the size that cor-
responds with an image that you have
copied to the clipboard. You can also
choose to match the size of any open file.
Open files are listed at the bottom of the
Preset list. 
Now for the best new preset — your own!
Photoshop now allows you to create a
user-defined custom preset based on your
defined settings. Click the Save Preset
button in the New Document Preset
dialog box. Name your preset. Choose
any or all the options you want to include
in your preset. When you choose not to
include an option, Photoshop displays the
last used value for that option. Click OK.
Your custom preset now appears at the
top of the Preset list.
As with other Photoshop dialog boxes,
you may change from the default unit of
measurement of pixels to another, such as
inches.
d Enter the resolution for the new
document.
For example, you may want to choose
72 pixels/inch for images that will be
displayed on-screen and 300 pixels/inch
for images that will be printed.

It’s important to choose the right resolu-
tion at this point in the creation process
because if you need to change the resolu-
tion later, you degrade image quality. For
more information on selecting an appro-
priate resolution, see Book II, Chapter 1.
Note that Photoshop now kindly gives you
the size of your image in the lower-right
of the dialog box based on your settings.
This is good information if you’re target-
ing a specific file size for your image.
e From the Color Mode drop-down list,
select a color mode.
Your choices include Bitmap,
Grayscale, RGB Color, CMYK Color, and
Lab Color. 
Photoshop CS now provides support for
16-bit images. Therefore, you can now
select the desired color depth for your
document. Only 1-bit color depth is avail-
able for Bitmap images (each pixel is
either black or white). The remaining 8-bit
and 16-bit color depths are available for
the other color modes. For details on
modes and color depths, see Book II,
Chapter 2.
f In the Background Contents drop-
down list, select an option for how you
want the background layer to be filled.
You choices are white, the current
background color, or transparent.
7.
Click the Advanced button to display
a couple of additional options the
New Document dialog box in
Photoshop CS now has. 
 Color Profile assigns a color profile
(a definition of the way color looks
in a document) to your new docu-
ment. The default color profile is the
Don’t Color Manage This Document
profile. I don’t recommend using
this setting. As an overall recom-
mendation, use Working RGB when
creating a new document unless you
have good reason not to otherwise.
This setting provides a nice, large
gamut (range) of RGB colors.
 Pixel Aspect Ratio selects an aspect
ratio (the relationship of Width to
Height). The default setting of
square is fine for print or Web
images. Images for digital video
content may require a non-square
aspect ratio such as D1/DV NTSC or
others.
8.
Click OK when you’re finished enter-
ing your options.
Photoshop creates the new image.

Saving a File
Before you exit Photoshop, you’ll want to save your file on your hard drive or other media.
Don’t worry if you forget to do this; Photoshop won’t let you exit without first asking you if
you’d like to save any files that you’ve changed or newly created. However, it’s a good idea to
save files from time to time as you work on them so that you always have a recent copy safely
stored on your drive.
Follow these steps to save a file:
1.
Choose File➪Save As.
Choose File➪Save to store the current
file under its present name. Choose
File➪Save As to store a new file never
saved or a file already saved under a
different name.
The Save As dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-8.
2.
Navigate to the folder where you’d
like to store the file.
3.
Type a name in the File Name text box.
4.
Choose a format from the Format
drop-down list.
Some file formats have special capabili-
ties and requirements. For example, if
your document has layers, you can
save it in TIFF or PSD or PDF formats.
Your options appear in the Save As
dialog box when you select a format.
For more information on file formats,
see Book II, Chapter 2.
e In the Save and Color Options areas,
select or deselect the following check
boxes as desired:
 As a Copy: Save the file as a copy.
 Annotations: Include or delete
annotations in the saved copy.
(See Book II, Chapter 5, for more
on annotations.)
 Alpha Channels: Include or ignore
alpha channels (stored selections).
(See Book VI, Chapter 1, for a dis-
cussion of channels.)
 Spot Colors: Enable spot colors in the
saved file. (For more information on
spot colors, see Book X, Chapter 2.)
 Layers: Include layers or simply flat-
ten the image to one layer. (See
Book V, Chapter 1, for the lowdown
on layers.)
 Use Proof Setup: Enable proof
setup, which includes an on-screen
preview of how the image will look
when printed or viewed on a spe-
cific device. (See Book II, Chapter 3,
for more information.)
 ICC Profile (Windows)/Embed
Color Profile (Mac): Embed a color
profile in the file based on the set-
tings established in your Color
Settings dialog box. Leave this value
at the default setting, but check out
Book II, Chapter 3, for information
on the specialized situations when
you might want to change it.
 Thumbnail (Windows only): Embed
a thumbnail image in the file if
you’ve defined thumbnails as
optional in Photoshop’s Preferences.
(You can find more on Preferences in
Book I, Chapter 6.)
 Use Lower Case Extension (Windows
only): Use lowercase extensions (that
is, .tif instead of .TIF) regardless of
how you type the filename.

Depending on which file format you
choose, you may get an additional
dialog box of options. For specifics on
these file format options, see Book II,

You usually want to have a backup copy of an
image safe on your hard drive any time you
make changes to a file and, often, periodically
throughout a work session. If you change your
mind about the modifications you’ve made to an
image, you can always return to the backup
copy. Photoshop offers several ways to create
such copies:
 Choose File➪Save As and enter a new
name to the file. It’s also a good idea
to specify a new location, such as another
hard drive or perhaps a removable storage
destination, such as a Zip disk or a CD-R/RW
disc.
 Choose File➪Save As and select the As
a Copy check box. Photoshop simply adds
“copy” to the current filename (for example,
myfile.psd becomes myfile copy.
psd) and saves the file under that new name.
Photoshop also enables you to create backup
snapshots of your images at any time (or even a
snapshot of an earlier version of the image by
using the History palette). However, because
Photoshop does not save these snapshots when
you close an image, you should use them just as
backups during a particular working session. For
more information on snapshots and the History
palette, see Book II, Chapter 4. In addition,
Photoshop now offers a Layer Comps palette,
which enables you to save different configura-
tions of your document by recording the appear-
ance of your layers. For details on this new
feature, see Book V, Chapter 2.

Applying Digital Copyrights
You may want to protect your work from unauthorized reuse by embedding digital copyright
information in the file — using the watermark capabilities in Photoshop (provided by
Digimarc technology). You should apply a watermark only after an image is finished. If you
change an image later, you have to apply the watermark to a new copy of the image; you
cannot add a watermark to an image that has previously been marked. Although watermark-
ing isn’t bulletproof, it can help preserve your rights.
Follow these steps to apply a digital copyright to an image:
1.
If your image has more than one layer,
choose Layer➪Flatten Image to com-
bine all the visible layers into one.
2.
If the image is an Indexed Color
image (for example, a GIF file),
choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color to
convert it to RGB mode.
You can always reconvert it to GIF after
applying the watermark.
3.
Choose Filter➪Digimarc➪Embed
Watermark.
The Embed Watermark dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 3-9.
4.
If this is the first time you’ve applied
a watermark, click the Personalize
button and follow the instructions to
register with Digimarc Corporation
over the Web or by telephone. Enter
your ID and PIN numbers as
instructed and then click OK.
Digimarc Corporation charges an
annual fee based on the number of
images you want to watermark and
your desired subscription level. For
example, 1 to 99 images at the basic
subscription level costs $49 per year.
5.
Enter a copyright year for the image
in the text box.
f Choose from the following options:
 Restricted to limit the use of the
image.
 Do Not Copy to specify that the
image should not be copied.
 Adult Content to mark the image
suitable for adults only.
g In the Target Output area, choose
whether the image is intended for
Monitor, Web, or Print display.
8.
In the Watermark Durability area,
drag the slider or enter a value.
Durability in this case is a compromise
between visibility (very durable) and
unobtrusiveness (not very visible). If
you make the watermark less visible,
someone can accidentally (or inten-
tionally) damage or make it less effec-
tive by some image-processing
operations. The more durable a water-
mark becomes, the more likely it will
be visible to the eye, but the image will
remain protected even if the image is
scanned, modified with filters, or
printed.
9.
Select the Verify check box in the
lower right.
This tells Photoshop to double-check
the image after the watermark is
applied, to make sure it was success-
fully embedded.
10.
Click OK to apply the watermark.

Closing and Quitting
63
Closing and Quitting
When your session is finished, you’ll want to close up shop and quit Photoshop. PC users, in
addition to using the traditional File➪Exit option, you can close Photoshop in any of the fol-
lowing ways:

Choose Close from the Windows Control menu in the upper-left corner of the
Photoshop title bar.

Click the Close (X) button in the upper-right corner of the Photoshop title bar under
Windows.

Press Ctrl+Q.

Mac users can choose Photoshop➪Quit or press Ô+Q.
With any of these methods, Photoshop asks you, in turn, if you’d like to save any open file that
has not been saved or has not been saved since it was modified in this session. Click the Yes
button to close and save the files.
You can also close any open files without exiting Photoshop by pressing Shift+Ctrl+W
(Shift+Ô+W on the Mac).

ard-copy prints have become a hugely popular output
option, thanks largely to the swarm of sub-$200 photo-
quality inkjet printers that are vying for your discre-
tionary dollars. Today, anyone can afford a printer capable of
producing sparkling prints from digital images. The chief prob-
lem is restraining the urge to print everything in sight before
your ink tank (and wallet) runs dry.
Actually, making the prints is only a minor puzzle, and one
addressed in this chapter. You can print most images with just
a few clicks. Most of the advanced options discussed in this
chapter are needed only for special situations or specialized
applications and are not discussed in detail; this chapter
covers only the basics. If you need more detailed or advanced
information on printing, see Book X, Chapter 2.
Taking a Look at Printers
You can print Photoshop images on any kind of printer, but,
aside from the occasional 200-copy print run of black-and-white
“Have You Seen This Kitty?” posters, monochrome laser printers
are not high on the list of favored Photoshop output hardware.
More often, you’ll be choosing a full-color printer, probably an
inkjet model, but also possibly a dye-sublimation, thermal-wax,
or even color laser printer model. Although all these printers
produce roughly similar results, they do have some differences,
as detailed in the following list:

Inkjet printers: These printers paint the page by spray-
ing a jet of ink one dot at a time, under precision com-
puter control. The ink can be water-based or solid ink
that is melted just before application. Liquid inks tend to
spread by soaking or wicking into the fibers of the paper,
can smear when wet, and produce better results when
used with photo paper designed especially for inkjets.

Most inkjet printers use four ink tanks for black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. A few use
six tanks, adding “weak” cyan and magenta hues to the strong colors and black to pro-
vide more colors. Regardless of configuration, inkjet printers generally provide excel-
lent full-color output, but the cost of consumables (ink and paper) can add up fast.

Dye-sublimation printers: These printers potentially offer better-looking prints, but
require even more expensive materials than inkjet printers. Most models cost more
than inkjet models. Many consumer-oriented dye-sub printers are models capable of
producing only snapshot-sized (roughly 4-x-6-inch) prints. They use a continuous ribbon
of color panels in a roll that is the same width as the print, with each panel used only
once. The print head’s tiny heating elements can melt dots of dye over a range of 256
values to generate up to 16.8 million colors. Professional dye-sub printers are accurate
enough to be used for color proofing.

Thermal-wax printers and solid-ink printers: These printers use blocks of wax or resin
that are melted and sprayed directly onto a page. Some apply ink to a drum that rolls
against a piece of paper, like an offset printing press. Significantly more expensive to
own and operate than inkjet printers, these devices are generally for advanced-amateur
or professional applications.
Printing an Image
The process of printing an image in Photoshop is slightly different in the Windows and Mac
OS operating systems. The chief differences are in the Page Setup step, in which you select a
printer and choose orientation, paper size, and other parameters. The next few sections take
a closer look at Page Setup in the two operating systems.
Even if you own a photo-quality printer, you may
want to take advantage of professional services
from time to time. For example, you may own a
dye-sublimation printer that cranks out snapshots
with aplomb but can’t give you a 5-x-7-inch or
8-x-10-inch print.
Hop in the car and jaunt over to a retailer in your
area equipped with one of those stand-alone
kiosks, such as the Kodak Picture Maker. These
devices accept images in many formats. You can
use your digital camera’s memory cards, Kodak
Photo CDs, or diskettes to supply fodder for
the kiosk. Most include scanners that can cap-
ture your original prints, slides, and negatives.
They even offer Photoshop-like picture-fixing
capabilities. You can adjust color, repair red-eye
problems, crop or enlarge your images, and add
text.
Many photofinishers or service bureaus can
make prints from your Photoshop-edited images
if you burn them to a CD, save them to a Zip
disk, or upload them to an FTP site over the
Internet. You can often purchase greeting cards,
T-shirts, mouse pads, and other printed output
that is difficult to duplicate at home. Large-format
prints, posters, and murals are other cool options.
Online service providers are also becoming
increasingly popular. Adobe has partnered with
shutterfly.com and MyPublisher.com to offer
prints of all sizes, calendars, and professionally
printed and bound photo books.

Page Setup in Microsoft Windows
With Windows applications such as Photoshop, you open the Page Setup dialog box by choos-
ing File➪Page Setup or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+P. In this dialog box, shown in Figure 4-1, you
can select the paper size, orientation (Portrait or Landscape), and other things, such as which
paper tray to use. If you click the Printer button, a second Page Setup dialog box appears.
Here, you can choose a specific printer from those attached to your computer or network.
Clicking the Properties button takes you to specific options customized for your printer, such
as print quality or special effects available with that printer. These vary from printer to
printer, so consult your printer’s instruction manual.
Page Setup in the Mac OS
To choose which printer is active in the Mac OS, use the Print Center to access the Page Setup
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-2, choose File➪Page Setup, or press Shift+Ô+P. You can set the
page size and orientation, scaling, and additional parameters, depending on your printer.
In Mac OS X, you can also choose a printer directly from the Print dialog box just as you can
in Windows. Also in Mac OS X, if you’re connected directly to a printer via the USB port, the
system automatically detects the printer. If you’re on a network, you can use Print Center
and select a printer from the Printer list or in the Print dialog box.

Setting Printing Options
Photoshop has several printing modes to choose from, depending on how much control you
need and how much of a hurry you’re in. Here are your options:

Print One Copy (Alt+Shift+Ctrl+P, or Option+Shift+Ô+P on the Mac) is a quick way to
print a hard copy using the default settings.

Print (Ctrl+P, or Ô+P on the Mac) pops up the standard Windows (or Mac) Print dialog
box, with options to choose a new printer, select which pages to print, select the
number of copies, and indicate whether to collate the output. The exact options avail-
able depend on what printer you are printing to.

Print with Preview (Alt+Ctrl+P, or Option+Ô+P on the Mac) opens an expanded Print
dialog box that includes a preview window and many more options to choose from. You
can even access the Page Setup dialog box from this dialog box if you want to change the
orientation, paper size, or switch to a different printer. This dialog box is almost identical
under the Windows and Mac operating systems, as you can see in Figures 4-3 and 4-4.
To set your print options, follow these steps:
Figure 4-2
1.
Choose File➪Print with Preview.
The Print dialog box opens.
2.
Use the Top and Left boxes in the
Position area to indicate where you
want the image to appear on the page. 
3.
To center the image, select the Center
Image check box.
4.
Select the Show More Options check
box and choose Output from the
drop-down list.
The other option on the drop-down
list, Color Management, controls
advanced proofing and color profile
tasks. Check out Book X, Chapter 2, for
information on printing using color
management, as well as Book II,
Chapter 3, for more detail on general
color-management topics.
Note that any options that don’t apply to
your selected printer are grayed out.

If you want to scale the image up or
down, choose the scale percentage
and/or enter height and width values
in the Scaled Print Size area.
(This doesn’t change the physical
dimensions of the image, just the print
size.) Additional options include:
 Show Bounding Box: Places the
handles around the image area and
allows for visual sizing.
 Print Selected Area: Allows you to
print only part of a large image.
 Scale to Fit Media: Sizes your image
to fit on a particular paper size.
6.
Choose the printing options you want
to apply:
 Background: The area surrounding
the printed image is called the back-
ground, not to be confused with the
background color on the Colors
palette or the background layer of
an image. You can change this color
from the default (white) to any other
color. Clicking the Background button
brings up the Color Picker tool. Black
is often the best background choice if
you are printing slides on a film
recorder and want the area outside
the image to remain dark.
 Border: The dialog box that pops up
lets you specify a black border to be
printed around an image in any
width from 0 to 10 points, 0 to 3.5
millimeters, or 0 to 1.5 inches.
 Bleed: A bleed is an image that
extends right up to the edge of the
paper size on one or more edges. In
effect, you’re cropping inside the
image area. In practice, most print-
ers don’t actually print right to the
edge, so to bleed, say, a 5-x-7-inch
image, you need to print it on a
larger sheet of paper, such as 8 x 10.
Clicking the Bleed button opens a
dialog box in which you enter a
width in inches, millimeters, or
points inside the edge of the image.
 Screen: When you click the Screen
button, you see the Halftone Screens
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-5,
which lets you create halftones for
color separation. See Book X,
Chapter 2, for more information on
color separations.
 Transfer: This is an advanced func-
tion used for prepress operations to
compensate for the change in dot
sizes when halftoned images are
printed on a press.
 Interpolation: This option is only
available with some printers, partic-
ularly PostScript Level 2 (or higher
models), to even out the jagged
appearance of diagonal lines in low-
resolution images. Just be aware
that interpolation can only help so
much and in some cases, it can be
damaging. For more on interpola-
tion, see Book II, Chapter 1. 
7.
Select options for marking the area
outside the print area. These include
several items that appear only when
the print area is smaller than the
paper size:
 Calibration bars: This option adds
an 11-step grayscale bar outside the
image area when printing to a paper
size that is larger than the image
area. You can use calibration bars to
gauge how accurately the gray tones
of an image are being reproduced.
 Registration marks: Registration
marks are handy when you’re print-
ing with multiple plates for color
separations, such as those used in
four-color or duotone processes.
These marks help keep the plates
aligned so the image is printed
properly.
 Corner crop marks: Clicking this
box prints crop marks at the cor-
ners of the image, which indicate
where trimming should take place.
You can see these and other marks
in Figure 4-6.

 Description: To include a descrip-
tion on a printout, choose File➪File
Info and enter the text you want to
appear. Then check the Description
box in this dialog box.
 Labels: Selecting this check box
prints the document name and
channel name on the image.
8.
Set the options that apply when
you’re printing to film for color sepa-
rations, if that’s the case.
Be sure to talk to your service bureau or
offset printer representative for their rec-
ommendations. For more tips on prepress
and printing, see Book X, Chapter 2.
Here are your choices:
 Emulsion Down: The side of a film
or photographic print paper that is
light sensitive is called the emulsion
side. You must specify whether you
want the emulsion side up or side
down for film output. Emulsion Down
is the most common film output
choice, although some publications
may request Emulsion Up. The
default is Emulsion Up (the check
box is not selected). This option is
not available with all printers.
 Negative: When you’re printing an
image on paper, you usually want a
positive image, in which case you
should not select the Negative check
box. However, if you’re printing the
image on film (as is the case if
you’re printing color separations),
your printer will probably request a
negative. To print a film positive, do
not select this check box.

P
hotoshop offers a variety of ways to view your image docu-
ments as you work with them. You can pull back to look at
the big picture or zoom in to work on a tiny portion of the
image in minute detail. A useful Navigator palette is also at hand
to show you exactly where you are in an image and help you
move to a specific spot with a click of the mouse button. Should
you want to align objects precisely on the screen, Photoshop
offers grids and guides with some “magnetic” properties. And, if
you’re having trouble finding the image you want, Photoshop
even includes a browser to help you search visually.
This chapter introduces you to all these viewing and navigating
aids, each designed to help you spend less time cruising
around the images and more time working with them.
Looking at the Image Window
Each Photoshop image document resides in its own window,
which provides multiple views of the same document. You can
drag the window anywhere in the Photoshop working space,
but you can’t drag it to a second display screen if you’re using
Photoshop with more than one monitor in Windows (Mac users
can, though). Remember that you can, however, move palettes
and dialog boxes onto a second monitor. 
You can move palettes and dialog boxes out of the main
working space (and onto a second monitor), but documents
must stay put in the original display if you’re using Windows.
The image window comes in handy because sometimes you’ll
want to look at an image from two perspectives. For example,
you may want to get up close and personal with an image to
edit pixels, but you still want to view the full image in a fairly

large size. Or, you might want to zoom in on two different portions of an image, but find that
simply enlarging the entire image on your screen doesn’t show both parts at once.
In either case, all you need to do is create a new image window for the same image. You can
size each window separately, and you can center the window on any portion of the image you
like, as shown in Figure 5-1. For example, you can have one window zoomed in on the upper-
right corner of an image and a second window zoomed in on the lower-right corner, and have
both visible on the screen at once.
Here’s a quick list of what you can do with multiple windows:

Keep different parts of an image straight by creating multiple windows. Select
the document window you want to duplicate, and then choose Window➪Arrange➪
New Window for (filename) from the menu bar. You can size and position the new
window and zoom in or out without affecting the view of the original window. I
describe some shortcuts for zooming later in this chapter.

Keep windows organized by cascading them. If you find that you’ve created so many
windows that you can’t view them all easily, Photoshop can automatically arrange them
for you in its working space. Choose Window➪Arrange➪Cascade to create an overlap-
ping stack of windows arranged from the upper-left to the lower-right side of your
display.
Figure 5-1

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
75

Keep from losing important windows by tiling them. Choose Window➪Arrange➪Tile
to arrange the windows side by side without overlapping. Photoshop changes the size
of the document windows so they all fit on the screen, but doesn’t change the zoom
amount. In many cases, the reduced-size windows have scroll bars to let you view the
hidden portion of the window.

Tidy up by closing windows you don’t need anymore. To close a specific window,
click its Close button in the upper-right corner of its title bar under Windows (at the top
left in the Mac OS).

Close all windows in one fell swoop. To close all windows, choose Window➪Arrange➪
Close All (or press Shift+Ctrl+W) in Windows. If you’re using Mac OS, choose File➪
Close All instead. On the Mac, you can also hold down the Option key and click the Close
button to close all open documents.

Minimize a document (in Mac OS). To minimize an active document and place the
thumbnail in the Dock, choose Window➪Arrange➪Minimize. To maximize the image,
simply click the image thumbnail in the Dock.

Bring all Photoshop documents to the front (in Mac OS). The Mac OS allows you to
work in multiple applications and multiple files simultaneously. Sometimes when you
switch back into working in Photoshop, your documents may be buried behind non-
Photoshop files that are open in the other applications (the files are interleaved).
Choose Window➪Arrange➪Bring All to Front to bring all your Photoshop documents
to the forefront.
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Photoshop offers several ways to zoom in or out of an image, but you’ll probably find yourself
using one method, such as the keyboard shortcuts, almost instinctively. 
Each method has advantages of its own. Here’s a quick discussion of each:

Keyboard shortcuts: While using any tool, hold down the Shift key. Then press the Alt
key (or press spacebar+Option on the Mac) and click to zoom out from a point centered
on where you click. Press the Ctrl key instead (or spacebar+Ô on the Mac) and click to
zoom in to a point centered on where you click the mouse button. Photoshop zooms in
or out by one of its preset increments (such as 100 percent, 200 percent, or 50 percent,
33 percent, 25 percent, and so forth). The maximum magnification Photoshop allows is
1,600 percent; the minimum magnification is 0.0533 percent.
Using keyboard shortcuts is the best way to change magnifications on the fly.

Zoom tool: Click the Zoom tool in the Tools palette or press Z to activate it. Click any-
where in the image to magnify it by one of the preset magnifications mentioned in the
preceding bullet. Hold down the Alt key (or the Option key on the Mac) and click with
the Zoom tool to zoom out. In either case, the zoom centers on the point you click. The
Zoom tool’s big advantage is its zoom selection facility. With the Zoom tool, drag in
your image to create a temporary selection. When you release the button, Photoshop
zooms in to fill the image window at the highest magnification that includes the
selected area.

Chapter

Book I  Chapter 5: Viewing and Navigating Images
76

Options bar zoom buttons: When the Zoom tool is active, plus (+) and minus (–) zoom
buttons appear on the Options bar, as shown in Figure 5-2. You can click the buttons to
enlarge or reduce the image to the next preset percentage, centering the zoom on the
center of the image.
As you zoom in and out, Photoshop does not alter the size of the document window, so
your image may become too large for its window (in which case scroll bars appear so
you can view the rest of the image) or too small (in which case a gray border appears
around the image). 
Select the Resize Windows to Fit option on the Options bar, and Photoshop automatically
changes the size of the document window to show the full document in view, up to the size
of the Photoshop working area.

Menu zoom: Choose View➪Zoom In or View➪Zoom Out to enlarge or reduce the image
from the menu bar. You can also choose from these options on the View menu:
 Actual Pixels (which shows your image on the screen at 1:1 pixel ratio)
 Fit on Screen (which enlarges the image to the maximum size that will fit on the screen)
 Print Size (which shows the image at the size it will print)

Magnification box: The Magnification box in the status bar at the bottom of the
Photoshop working area (in Windows) or the bottom of each document (in Mac OS)
shows the current magnification ratio. Many Photoshop users don’t realize you can also
type in an exact magnification ratio in this box to produce a custom zoom level. This is
handy if you need a specific amount of enlargement or reduction.
Another Magnification box appears in the Navigator palette, along with some other options
for zooming. I describe them later in this chapter.

Match Zoom: Photoshop CS offers a new command for zooming when you have more
than one document open. Choose Match Zoom to have all your open documents match
the magnification percentage of your active document. 

Match Location: Another new command, Match Location, matches the locations of all
your open documents with the location of your active document. For example, if you
are viewing the center portion of an image, choosing this command then adjusts the
views of all your open documents to the center as well.

Match Zoom and Location: And finally, Match Zoom and Location does both commands
simultaneously.
Match Zoom, Match Location, and Match Zoom and Location are new to Photoshop CS.

Zooming tricks
After you’ve absorbed the basic features of the various zoom alternatives in Photoshop, you’ll
want to find out about some of the special tricks built into them. Here’s a list of the most
useful options:

Magnify by dragging. With the Zoom tool, drag over the portion of the image you want
to zoom into. A selection marquee appears, and when you release the mouse button,
that portion of the image fills your document window. To freeze and then move the
selection marquee around the image, begin your drag and then hold down the spacebar
while dragging the marquee to a new location.

Double-click the Zoom tool to display the image at 100 percent magnification. You
can also choose View➪Actual Pixels from the menu bar or, if the Zoom tool is active,
click the Actual Pixels button on the Options bar.

Choose View➪Fit on Screen to make an image the largest possible size that will fit on
the screen. You also can click the Fit on Screen button on the Options bar if the Zoom
tool is active or (the fastest way) just double-click the Hand tool. (You can find more on
the Hand tool later in this chapter.)
To resize windows to fit on the screen when you’re not using the Zoom tool, choose
Edit➪Preferences➪General (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪General in Mac OS X) and select
the Keyboard Zoom Resizes Windows option.
Handling the Hand tool
The Hand tool helps you to quickly move around in an image document. The Hand tool works
similarly to a scroll bar, but you’ll probably find the scroll bar to be more efficient. 
The Hand tool is more of a function than an actual tool because you rarely need to click the
Hand tool to use it. Simply press the spacebar while using any other tool, and the cursor
changes into the Hand icon, enabling you to move the image around in its window by dragging.
Here are some tips for using this tool:

Press H to activate the tool: To activate the Hand tool without clicking its icon on the
Tools palette, just press the H key.

Use the Options bar to change the size of a window: When the Hand tool is active, the
Actual Pixels, Fit on Screen, and Print Size buttons appear in the Options bar. Click
these buttons to enlarge or reduce the image window so the whole image fits in the
window; make the document as large as it can be in your working space; or make the
document appear in the size it will be when printed.

Use the Hand tool as a spacebar lock: When the Hand tool is active, you can hold
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click in the image to zoom out, or
hold down the Ctrl key (Ô key on the Mac) and click to zoom in — without needing
to hold down the spacebar as you would with the normal keyboard shortcut.
The Hand-tool-as-a-spacebar-lock trick is new in Photoshop CS. Another new option, Scroll
All Windows, enables you to move around all open documents simultaneously.

Double-clicking the Hand tool resizes the document image so its longest dimension expands
to fill the screen in that direction. A tall, portrait-oriented image balloons up until the docu-
ment is as tall as possible in the Photoshop working area. A wide, landscape-oriented image
expands its width to fit within the left and right borders of the screen.

Press the Page Up or Page Down buttons to change the view. These buttons move the
view up or down by a window.
Now that you have become friendly with the Zoom and Hand tools, here is one last tip. If
you hold down the Shift key while scrolling with the Hand tool or zooming with the Zoom
tool, all open image windows will scroll or zoom together. This can come in especially handy,
for example, when you have created another view of the same document (Window➪
Arrange➪New Window).
Cruising with the Navigator Palette
Some Photoshop users don’t use the Navigator palette, which is a roadmap to your image
document, nearly as often as they could, and there’s a simple reason for that: In its default
size, the Navigator palette is just too darned small to be of use. 
Most new Photoshop users see the tiny Navigator window and decide that working with such
a small thumbnail image isn’t worth the bother. There’s a quick fix, and after you’ve seen
exactly what the Navigator palette can do for you, it may become one of your favorite tools.
Here are the keys to using the Navigator palette:

Resize the Navigator palette: Before you begin working with the Navigator palette, grab
the size box at the lower-right corner of the Navigator palette and drag it down and to
the right to create a jumbo version with a much larger, more viewable thumbnail, as
shown in Figure 5-3.
This works really well if you are using a second monitor, especially in Windows, since you
can’t put another document window on the second monitor. Placing the jumbo-sized
Navigator palette on the second monitor is the next best thing.
The Navigator palette is one palette that you probably won’t want to relegate to the Palette
Well. It’s most useful when it is visible at all times. Position the Navigator palette to one side
of your image so it’s ready for instant use.

View the thumbnail: The entire Navigator window shows the full document image, with
an outline called a View box showing the amount of image visible in the document
window at the current zoom level.

Change the view: Click anywhere in the thumbnail outside the View box to center the
box at that position. The comparable view in your main document window changes to
match.

Choosing a Screen Mode
79

Move the view: Click anywhere in the thumbnail inside the View box and then drag to
move the box to a new position. The main document window changes to match the new
view.

Zoom in or out: Click the Zoom In button (which has an icon of two large pyramids) or
Zoom Out button (which has an icon of two smaller pyramids) to zoom in or out. Or
drag the Zoom slider that resides between the two icons. The View box changes sizes as
you zoom in or out, and Photoshop magnifies or reduces the view in the original docu-
ment window to match, as well.

Specify an exact magnification: The lower-left corner of the Navigator palette has a
Magnification box just like the one in the status bar. It shows the current magnification,
and you can type in a new value to zoom to the exact magnification level you need.
If the View box color is too similar to a dominant color in your image, you can choose a new
color for its outline by selecting Palette Options from the Navigator palette pop-up menu.
Choosing a Screen Mode
Photoshop’s working area can become horribly cluttered. And here’s a secret: The more adept
you become, the more cluttered the desktop becomes. Just when you begin to appreciate a
neatly docked Options bar and the convenience of displaying palettes, you realize that you’ve
gobbled up all your free working space.

Even if you have a behemoth 22-inch monitor or use a dual monitor setup, you may still
find that your screens fill up faster than Yankee Stadium on Bat Day. 
Photoshop has three different screen modes (or maybe five, depending on what you consider to
be a screen mode). Each mode shows or hides some of the elements on the screen at the press
of a key or click of the mouse button. Three screen modes are on the Tools palette; two more are
hidden but easily accessible. Table 5-1 shows you how to unclutter your screen quickly.

Getting Precise Layout Results

Getting Precise Layout Results
Photoshop includes numerous useful features that help you lay out your images precisely.
There are dozens of reasons to make a selection in a particular place, position an object at an
exact location, or align several objects along the same imaginary line. Here are a few examples:

You want to draw parallel lines exactly 50 pixels apart to create a “window blind” effect.

You’re creating a set of thumbnails that need to be aligned so they line up in neat rows
and columns.

You want to create an object that is the exact same size (in one or more dimensions) as
another object already in your image.
You have several tools to help you do this, and more.

Creating guides
Guides are nonprintable horizontal and vertical lines that you can position anywhere you like
within a document window. Normally, they are displayed as solid blue lines, but you can
change guides to another color and/or to a dashed line. 
To use guides, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grid, & Slices (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪
Guides, Grid, & Slices in Mac OS X), as discussed in Book I, Chapter 6. Guides would be useful
even if they were only, well, guides. However, they have another cool feature: Objects and tools
Figure 5-4

82
dragged to within 8 screen pixels of a guide are magnetically attracted to the guide and snap
to it. That makes it ridiculously easy to align objects precisely. Because the objects snap to
the guides, you can be confident that you have placed the objects exactly on the guide and
not just near it. You can turn off the “snap to” feature if you want a little less precision in your
arrangements. 
To place guides, follow these steps:
1.
Make sure that rulers are visible in
your image. Choose View➪Rulers to
display them, if necessary.
Anytime you create a guide by dragging
from the ruler, the Show Guides option
automatically switches on. At other times,
you can show or hide guides by choosing
View➪Show➪Guides, or by pressing
Ctrl+semicolon (Ô+semicolon on the Mac).
b Click in the horizontal ruler and drag
down to create a new horizontal
guide. Release the mouse button when
the guide is in the location you want.
c Click in the vertical ruler and drag to
the right to create a new vertical guide. 
When you release the mouse button,
your new guide stops.
You can also create a horizontal guide
by Alt+clicking in the vertical ruler
(Option+clicking on the Mac), or a
vertical guide by Alt+clicking in the
horizontal ruler (Option+clicking on
the Mac). Use whichever method is
faster for you.
4.
Use the Move tool (press V to activate
it) to reposition your guides.
Look for the guides in Figure 5-5.

Figure 5-5

Getting Precise Layout Results
83
Using guides
After the guides are in place, here are a few of the things you can do with them:

Turn the Snap to Guides feature on or off: Choose View➪Snap To➪Guides.

Lock all guides so you don’t accidentally move them: Choose View➪Lock Guides.
You can also select Alt+Ctrl+semicolon (Option+Ô+semicolon on the Mac).

Remove all guides and start from scratch: Choose View➪Clear Guides.

Change a horizontal guide to a vertical guide (or vice versa): Hold down the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) as you drag the guide.

Align a guide at a precise location on the ruler: Hold down the Shift key as you drag
a guide to force it to snap to the ruler ticks.

Create a new guide in a precise location: Choose View➪New Guide, click the
Horizontal or Vertical option, and type in a distance from the ruler where you want
the new guide to reside.
Using grids
The Photoshop Grid feature offers a convenient canned set of guidelines already nicely
arranged for you at preset intervals. You can use a grid for any application where you want
to align objects in a pleasing, geometrically precise arrangement.
Grids share some features in common with guides but boast a few differences, too:

Like guides, grids don’t print with your image. They are transparent artifacts used only
as reference lines in your image, as shown in Figure 5-6.

Objects and tools can optionally snap to the lines on a grid, depending on whether you
have View➪Snap To➪Grid turned on or off.

You can show or hide grids by choosing View➪Show (Hide)➪Grid.

You can change the color of the grid and choose solid lines, dashed lines, or dots for
the grid by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Guides, Grids, & Slices (Photoshop➪
Preferences in Mac OS).

You can specify the distance between grid lines and the number of subdivisions
between grid lines in the Preferences dialog box. For more information on setting
grid and guide preferences, see Book I, Chapter 6.

Measuring On-Screen
You can measure distances and objects within Photoshop many different ways. The rulers,
used in combination with guides, are a good way to mark distances precisely so that you can
create objects of a particular size. You can change the increments used for these measure-
ments in Photoshop’s Preferences, as detailed in Book I, Chapter 6.
However, Photoshop also has a handy Measure tool you can use to lay measurement outlines
in any direction (not just vertically or horizontally as with grids and guides). These lines tell
you a great deal more than just the size of the object you’re measuring. You can also measure
angles and determine the exact coordinates of an object.
When you use the Measure tool, the Options bar offers a read-out of information that includes
the following values:

X, Y — the X and Y coordinates of the start of the line: For example, if you start at the
1-inch position on the horizontal ruler and the 3-inch position on the vertical ruler, the
X and Y values in the Options bar are 1.0 and 3.0, respectively. (You select the incre-
ments for the X and Y values on the ruler in Photoshop’s Preferences.)

W, H — the horizontal (W) and vertical (H) distances traveled from the X and Y
points: A 1-inch long, perfectly horizontal line drawn from the X,1 and Y,3 position
shows a W value of 1.0 and an H value of 0.0.

A: The angle of the first line.

D1: The total length of the line.

D2: The total length of the second line.

Using the Info Palette
The Info palette, shown in Figure 5-9, displays a variety of information, depending on what
tool you’re using. For example, if you’re using the Measure tool, the information in the Info
palette duplicates the measurements shown in the Options bar. Choosing other tools modifies
the Info palette’s display to reflect the functions of that tool. Here is some of the information
you can find out by keeping the Info palette visible on your desktop:

When using most tools, the Info palette displays the X and Y coordinates of the cursor,
as well as the color values of the pixel directly beneath the cursor.

When making a selection with the marquee tools, the Info palette shows both the X and
Y coordinates of the cursor, as well as the width and height of the selection.

When dragging with the Crop or Zoom tools, the Info palette shows the width and
height of the marquee used to define the cropping or zoom borders. The Crop tool’s
current angle of rotation is also displayed.

With the Line, Pen, and Gradient tools, the Info palette shows the X and Y coordinates
of the starting position for the line, path, or gradient you are defining, as well as the dis-
tance (D) of the line you’ve dragged, the change in X and Y directions (DX and DY), and
the angle (A).
2

e Drag the second line and release the
mouse button when it is finished.
6.
In the Options bar, read the angle
between the two lines (A).
You can also see the length of each of
the lines as D1 and D2, as shown in
Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-8

Working with Extras
87

When you use a transformation command, the Info palette displays the percentage
change in the Width, Height, and Angle, Angle of Horizontal Skew (H), and Angle of
Vertical Skew (V). For more on transformations, see Book III, Chapter 3.

When you use a color adjustment, such as Levels, the Info palette displays before and
after color values beneath the mouse cursor. See Book VIII, Chapter 1, for more on color
adjustments.

After you’ve made a selection with the Lasso or Magic Wand tools, the Info palette also
shows the Width and Height of the selection. Choose Palette Options from the Info
palette’s pop-up menu (click the triangle in the upper right to open the pop-up menu).
Here you can define a second color readout in addition to the default readout, using a
different color model if you want. In addition to the regular color modes, the default
Actual Color option displays values in the current mode of the document. Proof color
displays values based on the setting chosen in View➪Proof Setup. The Total Ink option
displays the percentage CMYK ink under the cursor based on the settings in the CMYK
Setup dialog box in the Color Settings (Advanced). You can also define a measurement
increment for the mouse cursor (in inches, pixels, millimeters, and so forth) independ-
ently of the increment you’ve selected in Preferences. (For more information on setting
increments in Preferences, see Book I, Chapter 6.)
Working with Extras
Extras are the optional items displayed on your screen, such as grids, guides, selection edges,
annotations, slices, and the target path (a line drawn with the Pen tool). Although you can turn
on and off the display of each of these options independently, the Extras function helps you to
create a set of extras that you want to see or hide. You can then turn them all on or off at once.
The following list explains how to show or hide these extras:

To turn one extra on or off, choose View➪Show and then choose the extra you want to
show or hide in the Show Extras Options dialog box, shown in Figure 5-10.

To show or hide extras in a group, choose View➪Show➪Show Extras Options. Select
each extra that you want to show in the dialog box that appears.

To show or hide all the extras you’ve selected in Extras Options, choose View➪Extras
or press Ctrl+H (Ô+H on the Mac).

Managing Images with the File Browser
The File Browser, shown in Figure 5-11, is a powerful tool that gained even more power in
Photoshop CS. The File Browser lets you visually explore your hard drives and external media
to find the exact image you need and has a multitude of sorting and viewing features that let
you list the images in various ways.
As you can with any browser, you can use the Photoshop File Browser after very little prac-
tice. Many of its functions are similar to browsing functions you already know. There are
several ways to access the File Browser. 

Choose Window➪File Browser.

Choose File➪Browse.

Click the new File Browser button on the Options bar.
Figure 5-11
Figure 5-10

Managing Images with the File Browser
89
No matter how you access the File Browser, after you open it, this behemoth of a window fills
your screen. And because the File Browser has become such a feature-rich entity, I describe
its various components in the next few sections.
Note that the File Browser has undergone an identity change. In Version 7, the File Browser
was a palette; in Photoshop CS, it has gained window status and can no longer be docked
in the Palette Well. It also means, unfortunately, that if you’re a Windows user and you use
a dual monitor setup, you will not be able to drag the File Browser onto your second moni-
tor. If you’re a Mac user, you’re in luck — you’ve always been able to move any palette,
dialog box, or window and still can. In addition, because the File Browser is now a window,
it doesn’t automatically close after you open your images.
Brief Anatomy of the File Browser
Before I dive headlong into the detailed operations of the File Browser, let me give you a brief
anatomical breakdown of each of its components, shown in Figure 5-11.

Menu bar: Commands found on the menu bar allow you to open or delete images, edit
an image in ImageReady, add file info, and search for images. You can also flag files and
append their metadata (information about your file). See more on metadata coming up.
The menu bar also offers options for sorting and viewing files. Finally, you have access to
basically the same Automate menu that you find in Photoshop itself (in the File menu).

Buttons: Rotate, flag, search, or delete files with a click of the button.

Location bar: Across the top center edge of the File Browser is a location bar that lists
the current location (such as a folder on your hard drive) on display.

Show bar: Choose to display files that are either flagged or unflagged files or both.

Folders palette: Located in the upper-left corner of the File Browser is a palette
showing the folders on your computer. If an image file is available to your computer,
the File Browser lets you use this palette to find it.

Preview image: Beneath the Folder palette is a preview of the currently selected image.

Main browser window: Beneath the location bar is a scrollable browsing window that
shows thumbnail images of all the image documents in the currently selected folder. In
addition, any folders located within the current folder are shown with a folder icon.

Keywords palette: This new feature lets you tag your images with keywords such as the
names of people or places to enable easier locating and sorting of images.

Metadata palette: Below the Preview window is a Metadata palette that shows informa-
tion about your images. The File Properties section shows items such as filename, date
of creation, date last modified, image format and size, and so on. Any file information
for images added via the File➪File Info displays in the IPTC section of the Metadata
palette. Likewise, you can also enter, or edit file information directly in the IPTC section
in the File Browser. Finally, the Camera Data section displays information associated
with your digital photos, such as the make and model of your camera, and exposure
and ISO speed. You can also display other types of metadata, such as Camera Raw infor-
mation, by choosing them in the Metadata Display Options dialog box accessed via the
Metadata palette pop-up menu.

Configuring the File Browser Window
The File Browser, being as enormous and full-featured as it is, is surprisingly flexible when it
comes to how you configure its various panes and palettes. Here’s a rundown of how to cus-
tomize your File Browser window:

To size the entire File Browser window, diagonally drag any corner or edge of the
window. On the Mac, drag the lower-right corner.

To resize panes, drag the bar that divides them. Position your cursor over the bar
(it changes to a double-headed arrow) and click and drag the bar to size the pane.

To view just the large pane containing the thumbnails, click the double-headed arrow
located at the bottom of the File Browser window.

You can drag and regroup the tabbed palettes in the File Browser just as you can the
regular Photoshop palettes. To collapse a palette, double-click its tab.

After you have configured your File Browser, you can save it as a workspace preset that
you can then call up at anytime. Simply choose Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace.
Provide a name and click Save. To access the workspace, choose Workspace and then
select the name of your saved preset. For more on workspaces, see Book I, Chapter 6.
Using the menu bar and buttons
The File Browser now sports a new menu bar, shown in Figure 5-12. This menu bar is a
visual testimony to the newly expanded capabilities of the File Browser. The next several
sections provide a rundown of what you’ll find under each menu category.
File menu
Here’s what you’ll find on the File Browser’s File menu:

New Folder: This command creates a new folder in the location listed in the location bar.

Open: After you select a thumbnail in the main browser window, you can choose the
Open command to open the image in Photoshop. Of course, you can also simply
double-click the selected file(s). To open multiple files, just press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac)
while selecting. To select a group of contiguous files, Shift+click the first and last files to
select those and all the files in between.

Edit in ImageReady: Choose this command if you want to open the selected files in
ImageReady to prep the files for the Web.

Close File Browser: When you’ve had enough of the File Browser, choose this com-
mand. Or click the Toggle File Browser button in the Options bar.
To have the File Browser close after you open an image, be sure to Alt+double-click
(Option+double-click on the Mac) when you select your files in the File Browser window.
Figure 5-12

Managing Images with the File Browser


File Info: This feature lets you add some of your own metadata, such as title, author,
copyrights, dates, credits, and so on. This information can come in handy for photogra-
phers and reporters. You can also edit (replace, append, save, and delete) Advanced
Data such as EXIF (Extended File Information) Properties and TIFF Properties. But feel
free to leave this data as it is.

Delete: To get rid of a selected image, choose Delete or click the trash can icon.
Be warned that choosing Delete removes the image(s) from your hard drive or external
media, not just from the File Browser view.

Add/Remove Folder to Favorites: You can choose to add or remove a folder from your
Favorites. If you’re not familiar with Favorites, it is a special folder that lists your
favorite files, folders, programs, and drives for quick and handy access. You can easily
find the Favorites folder in the folder bar and the location bar. And depending on your
operating system, you’ll come across numerous ways to access your Favorites.

Cache commands: Cache is memory that stores frequently used data, such as thumb-
nails and file info, to allow for quicker loading when you display a previously viewed
image or folder. Building cache for a subfolder will allow you store the information for
a selected folder. If you purge the cache, you delete ranking and thumbnail information,
thereby creating more disk space. Exporting cache lets you export to the folder selected
in the location bar. This allows you to burn a CD without generating thumbnails. 
Search is a great new feature that enables you to find files in selected folders or subfolders,
based on a variety of criteria such as filename, dates, flags or keywords. Click Search and the
files matching your criteria appear in the File Browser window. Note that you can also click
the Search icon (binoculars icon) on the menu bar.
Assigning keywords to files is one of the quickest and most efficient ways to search for and
locate images.
Many commands, such as Open, Delete, Rotate, Flag, and Rank, are available via a context-
sensitive menu. Simply select an image or folder and right-click (Control+click on the Mac)
to access the menu.
Edit menu
On the File Browser’s Edit menu, here are your options:

Select All/Deselect All: These two commands quickly select or deselect all the files in
your selected folder.

Select All Flagged: Selects all flagged images located in your selected folder.

Flag: Select your desired images and choose Flag. Photoshop then tags the images and
adds a small flag icon to the thumbnail, shown in Figure 5-13. You can flag images for
distinction and quick locating. Think of it as an electronic sticky note. For example, you
can flag images that need editing or retouching or those you are considering using for
an upcoming project.
You can also quickly flag images by clicking the Flag icon in the menu bar.


You can also choose to display either Flagged, Unflagged, or both Flagged and
Unflagged files from the Show drop-down list.

Rank: You can create your own custom sorting order by applying a “rank” for each
image. Happily, you are no longer limited to ranking images from A to E. Apply any
alphanumeric text, and Photoshop does its best to make sense of your ranking scheme
and sort the images in a logical order. Numeric rankings appear first, followed by alpha
rankings.
Remember I said Photoshop tries to logically sort your ranking. But be warned that if you
number your images 1, 2, 12, and 122, Photoshop sorts the images as 1, 12, 122, and 2.
Photoshop looks to the first character, then the second, and so on.

Clear Ranking: Choose this command to strip all ranking from your images in the
selected folder.

Rotate: The rotate commands rotate your images in varying degrees and direction. Note
that when you rotate your images, the rotation is shown in the File Browser only when
you open the image. When you open the image, Photoshop then applies the rotation.
Use the Apply Rotation command to apply rotation without opening the file. You can
also click the rotate buttons.

Append Metadata and Replace Metadata: Allow you to add or substitute existing meta-
data based on a template. To create a template, choose File➪File Info. In the File Info
dialog box, enter all of your desired data. Then choose Save Metadata Template from
the dialog box pop-up menu. Name the template and click Save.

Metadata Display Options: This command allows you to choose the fields displayed in
each of the metadata categories.

Preferences: Selecting this command brings up the File Browser options of the
Preferences dialog box. In addition, all other preferences are accessible as well. Here
you can specify the file size limit of images you allow the File Browser to process. The
default size is 100MB, while the maximum size allowed is 2047MB. However, allowing
the File Browser to process extremely large files slows down its performance. If you

don’t work in the world of mondo files, leave Preferences at the default setting and
don’t worry about it. Here is the lowdown on the other Preference settings:
 Display: You can specify the number of most recently used folders in your location
bar pop-up menu.
 Custom Thumbnail Size: Choose a Custom thumbnail size for displaying your images
when you choose View➪Custom Thumbnail Size. Specify the Width of your thumb-
nail in pixels. 
 Allow Background Processing: Select this option to allow Photoshop to process
images in the background while you execute other tasks.
 Pre-generate High Quality Previews: This option enables the File Browser to create
high-quality preview thumbnails of all images in your selected folder even before you
select them. You must have Background Processing turned on to be able to select
this option.
 Render Vector Files: Select this option if you want to allow your non-Photoshop files,
such as EPS and PDF files, to be rendered, or displayed, in the File Browser window.
 Parse XMP Metadata from Non-image Files: This setting removes metadata from
non-graphic images, such as text files.
 Keep Sidecar Files with Master Files: The Camera Raw file format has a feature that
enables conversion and adjustment settings to be recorded and stored with the file.
These settings are stored in a sidecar file, which is an XMP (Adobe’s version of XML)
data file. If you want to be able to reopen your file and have your conversion settings
intact, select this option. If you want the conversion data stored in a single, collective
file in the Camera Raw database, deselect this option.
You’ll notice the standard Copy command isn’t in the Edit menu. To copy a file, Alt+drag
(Option+drag on the Mac) the file into another folder. To move a file, just drag it into
another folder, either in the Folders palette or in the thumbnail panel.
Automate menu
On the File Browser’s Automate menu, you have the following options:

Batch: This command applies an action to multiple files within your selected folder in
one fell swoop. For more on actions and batch processing, see Book II, Chapter 6.

Batch Rename: Choose this command to rename multiple image files within a folder in
one execution. You can choose to rename the files and keep them in the same folder or
move them to a new folder. Click the Choose button to select that folder. Next, desig-
nate how your files are named. Choose an option from the pop-up menu or type your
own. In my example, I chose to keep the original name of my documents, plus NYC, the
date, and file extension. Next, choose the starting number for renamed images and
check whether you want to enable the naming convention to be compatible with
another platform. My images were quickly renamed, as shown in Figure 5-14.


Apply Format Settings: If you have a file selected in the browser, and the file is in a
format that supports it (such as Camera Raw), the settings in the Camera Raw plug-in
will tweak the results and be shown in the file browser. Any plug-in can potentially take
advantage of this function, but currently the Camera Raw plug-in is the only one that
does. Therefore, if you have the Camera Raw file selected, and the Camera Raw plug-in
installed, the menu command will read “Apply Camera Raw Settings.” However, if you
don’t have both of those conditions, the command will be grayed out and will just say
“Apply Format Settings.”

Online Services: You can access Adobe’s partners and service providers online to
order products such as prints and photo books.

All the remaining features are the same as those found in the Photoshop File➪
Automate menu. See Book X, Chapter 3, for more on contact sheets, picture packages,
Photomerge, and PDF Presentation. For more on Web Photo Gallery, see Book IX,

Sort menu
From this menu in the File Browser, select the criteria by which you want to sort your files.
The default is by the name of your file, but a ton of other options, such as rank, flag, or date,
are up for grabs. After you select the criteria, the File Browser displays your files accordingly.

View
And last but not least, here’s what the File Browser’s View menu has to offer:

Folders: Select this option to view folder icon thumbnails, in addition to image thumb-
nails, in your File Browser.

Unreadable Files: Select this option to see files that Photoshop does not recognize.

Flagged/Unflagged: Choose to view either flagged, unflagged, or both flagged and
unflagged files in the File Browser. For more on flags, see the earlier section, “Using the
menu bar and buttons.”

Thumbnails: Choose the viewing size of your thumbnails. The Custom Thumbnail size
is based on your Preferences setting. The Details view displays the metadata in the File
Browser window, next to a small thumbnail of the image.

Show Rank: Choose this option to display the ranking, if any, of each image. You can
use ranking to sort your images in a specific order.

Reveal Location in Explorer (Finder on the Mac): If you select a file and then choose
this option, the File Browser opens a Windows Explorer window and shows you the
location of that file on your system.

Refresh: If you’ve renamed a file, the order of your files isn’t updated in the File
Browser window. Choose Refresh or press F5, to get your files in order. Note that you
can also choose Refresh from the Folders palette pop-up menu.
Closing and opening files also causes the File Browser to refresh.
Photoshop CS has bestowed the thumbnail pane with light-box powers. You can now drag
images around to reorder, group, or rank them. What the heck? You can just drag them
around to give them a little exercise if you want. Sitting in that File Browser window all day
can make a file a little stiff.
Working with Metadata
When you select an image, you can view its metadata. Metadata is just a fancy name for infor-
mation that is embedded in your image file. In fact, Photoshop allows an image to have so
much attached information, the only thing you won’t know is your image’s favorite color and
hobbies. The metadata categories include the default categories of File Properties, IPTC
(International Press Telecommunications Council), and Camera Data (EXIF or Extended File
Information). You can also choose to display the additional categories of GPS (Global
Positioning System), Camera Raw (a digital camera file format), and Edit History categories.
Choose Edit➪Metadata Display Options to access these categories. In the following sections,
you can find a brief description of each one.
File Properties
The fields in the File Properties category include common vitals, such as filename, size,
format, color mode, and so on. This data cannot be edited. 
Book
I
Chapter
5

Book I  Chapter 5: Viewing and Navigating Images
96
Choose View➪Details to display the File Properties data next to the image thumbnail. This
option allows you to collapse the left side of the File Browser without sacrificing the display of
important metadata.
IPTC
This data includes info commonly used in the media and press industry. Fields such as head-
line, credit, source, and copyright are available for input via the File➪File Info command. Or
make it easy: Select an image, or several images, and simply click the field in the File Browser
and type your entry. If you select more than one image, Photoshop asks if you want the
change to apply to all selected images. If so, click Yes. All fields are later editable as well.
The File Info dialog box is now extensible, which means that users can create custom panels
with fields specifically tailored to business needs or personal interests.
Camera Data (EXIF)
EXIF data is information that is attached to an image created from a digital camera. It includes
data such as make and model of camera, exposure, and F-Stop settings. If a digital camera
didn’t capture the image, it doesn’t have any EXIF data, although some scanners attach EXIF
data, such as date, time, pixel dimensions, and resolution. Camera Data is not editable.
GPS
Some files, such as images captured by satellites, may contain GPS, or Global Positioning
System, data. This data may contain information on latitude, longitude, altitude, direction,
speed, and so on. However, this data is not shown in the Metadata palette by default. Choose
the Metadata Display Options (described later) command to display the GPS data.
Camera Raw
Camera Raw is a file format used to capture images by a lot of different digital cameras. The
image information is captured directly from the camera’s sensors and is not adulterated by fil-
ters or adjustments made by the camera. This enables photographers to read the image data
and make their own controlled adjustments. Camera Raw data includes settings like white bal-
ance, temperature, exposure, color saturation, and so on. Like GPS data, the Camera Raw data
is not shown in the Metadata palette by default. Choose the Metadata Display Options com-
mand to display this information.
Edit History
The Edit History option records all the edits (image enhancements, retouches, and so on)
made on an image in an edit log that you can save as a text file or as attached metadata.
Choose the File Handling panel in the Preferences dialog box to establish your desired settings
for your editing history. See the section, “Deciding how you want files handled,” in Book I,
Chapter 6 for details.

The Metadata palette offers some options via the palette pop-up menu:

Search: Select Search to locate images by various metadata fields. For details on search-
ing, see the next section.

Increase/Decrease Font Size: Choose these options to enlarge or decrease the font size
in set increments.

Metadata Display Options: This command allows you to choose the fields displayed in
each of the metadata categories. Select the Hide Empty Fields option to display only
your selected data fields. Keep your palette lean and mean by choosing the Hide Empty
Fields option to hide metadata items that are set to display, but do not contain any data.
Note that you can define and create custom File Info panels for XMP metadata to suit your
company’s specific data needs. By creating a Custom Panel Description file and storing it in a
common location specified by Adobe applications that use this feature, this custom panel
shows up when users select File➪File Info either in the File Browser or in the Photoshop
application window. For specifics on this feature, download the XMP Custom Panels PDF
document at Adobe’s Web site.
Using Keywords
Keywords are descriptive labels that you attach to files. They help to categorize your images,
enabling you to more efficiently and quickly locate your desired files. Here is the lowdown on
creating and using keywords.

To create a new keyword set, click the folder icon at the bottom of the Keywords palette
or choose New Keyword Set from the Keywords palette pop-up menu. Name your set
and press Enter (Return on the Mac).

To create a new keyword, select your desired keyword set, click the dog-eared page
icon at the bottom, or choose New Keyword from the Keywords palette pop-up menu.
Type your name and press Enter (Return on the Mac).

To rename an existing keyword set or keyword, select it and choose Rename from the
Keywords palette pop-up menu. Provide a new name and press Enter (Return on the Mac).
Note that renaming a keyword in the palette doesn’t also rename it if it has already been
applied to a file.

To delete a keyword set or keyword from the palette, select it and click the trash icon or
choose Delete from the Keywords palette pop-up menu. Again, deleting the keyword
doesn’t delete it from any files that it has previously been applied to.

To apply a keyword, select the file or files and check the box to the left of the keyword
in the palette.

To remove a keyword from a file, select the file(s) and deselect the keyword in the
palette.

To apply all the keywords in a set, select the files and select the check box to the left of
the keyword set.

T
o a certain extent, Photoshop lets you have it your way
without having to make a trip down to the local burger
shack. You can easily customize the look of your work-
space, specifying everything from the location of palettes to
the arrangement of dialog boxes when you begin a session.
You can even store these physical layouts and recall them
anytime you like.
Photoshop also makes it easy to choose how certain tools and
features operate. You can choose how the cursors for tools
such as brushes look, tell Photoshop your preferred way of
storing files, and specify just how much memory you’d like to
set aside for image editing. You can set all these preferences
once and then forget them, or you can change them from time
to time as your needs change. This chapter shows you how to
customize your workspace and preferences so that Photoshop
works your way.
Creating Workspace Presets
Photoshop is a complicated program; the more you learn, the
more complicated (and routine) your activities become. For
one project, you may find yourself using the Styles palette
repeatedly to add special effects to layers. For your next proj-
ect, you may never use the Styles palette but require frequent
access to the Paths palette to create curves that you use to
make selections. And so it goes. Use custom presets to save
time and effort, or to instantly clean up a messy desktop.
Custom workspaces come in handy if you share a computer
with students, family members, or coworkers. Those who pre-
pare images for both Web and print have different needs that
may call for special workspaces, too.

You can create customized workspace presets that handle all these needs and a great deal
more. Here are some of the ways you can tailor your workspace:

Combine palettes to group the ones you use most often together. (For more informa-
tion on arranging palettes, see Book I, Chapter 1.) Drag a palette’s tab into another
palette group to add it to that group. If the Layers, Channels, and History palettes are
the ones you use most often, you might want to group them together. You can also hide
palettes that you rarely use for a particular project, tuck them away in the Palette Well,
or minimize them to their title bars.
Move a palette out of the way quickly by Shift+clicking its title bar. The bar snaps to the
nearest screen edge.
Before saving your workspace preset, show or hide the palettes as you prefer them and
move them to the locations you want on your screen.

Position dialog boxes. Photoshop’s menu bar dialog boxes pop up in the same location
they appeared the last time you used them. You may want to drag them to a specific
place on your screen and store that location when you save your workspace preset.
When I’m working with a large image, I sometimes position dialog boxes on the screen
of my second monitor to maximize the area for the image on my main display.

Customize the Options bar. You can grab the gripper bar at the left edge of the Options
bar and drag it to another location. For example, you can dock the bar at the lower edge
of your screen or have it float in a specific place on your Photoshop desktop. You can also
double-click the title bar of the floating Options bar to collapse it so that only the active
tool’s icon is showing. Photoshop stores these settings with your workspace preset.
Saving and Deleting Presets
After you’ve set up your workspace, you can save it by choosing Window➪Workspace➪Save
Workspace. In the Save Workspace dialog box that appears, type a name for your saved work-
space and click the Save button. Your saved workspace now appears as a listing on the
Workspace submenu.
To delete a saved workspace, choose Window➪Workspace➪Delete Workspace. In the Delete
Workspace dialog box that appears, choose the name of the workspace you want to remove
from the drop-down list. Click the Delete button, and your preset is gone, gone, gone.
Setting Your Preferences
Photoshop stores settings for many different options in a Preferences file on your hard drive.
The first time you run Photoshop after a new installation, you probably want to customize
Preferences to suit your own needs.
You can access the Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit➪Preferences (Photoshop➪
Preferences on the Mac). You can also press Ctrl+K (Ô+K on the Mac). The General
Preferences dialog box (shown in Figure 6-1) pops up by default, but you can choose any of
the other Preferences dialog boxes from the drop-down list. You can also move between the
dialog boxes by clicking the Prev or Next buttons that appear in each of the Preferences
dialog boxes. The next several sections give you a rundown of what you can do with the
settings in the different Preferences dialog boxes.

Setting Your Preferences
101
When the General Preferences dialog box is visible, you can switch to the other Preferences
dialog boxes by pressing Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 (Ô+1, Ô+2 on the Mac), and so forth. These short-
cuts can be useful if you need to frequently access particular dialog boxes.
Setting general preferences
The General Preferences dialog box is where you select some options that are, well, general in
nature. You can select some choices from drop-down lists, and others are check boxes you
can select or deselect to activate or disable that option. Here’s a rundown of options in the
upper part of the dialog box:

Color Picker: Choose the familiar Adobe Color Picker to select precise colors or work
with the Windows or Macintosh system color pickers, as desired. You might want to use
the Windows color picker, for example, if you’ve previously defined some custom colors
outside of Photoshop and now want to make them available for a Photoshop project.

From time to time, you may discover that
Photoshop has inexplicably trashed your prefer-
ences and reset all your settings to their default
values. Your first clue that this has happened may
be when you open the program and find the
palettes arrayed neatly on the right side of the
workspace in an arrangement you’d never use.
Surprise! An impossible-to-trace, tiny fault (think
bug) or unexpected behavior (either in Photoshop
or your operating system) has confused Photo-
shop to the extent that the program has wisely
decided to reset your preferences rather than con-
tinue with (possibly) corrupted settings.


Image Interpolation: When Photoshop resizes an image, it must either create new pixels
(when making the image larger) or combine existing pixels (to make the image smaller).
To do this, the program examines neighboring pixels and uses the information to derive
the new or replacement pixels. You can select the type of mathematical algorithm
Photoshop uses to do this. The Image Interpolation drop-down list offers these options:
 Nearest Neighbor (Faster): This is the fastest (and lowest quality) interpolation
method, under which Photoshop examines only one pixel to perform its calculations.
Use this method only if your work is not critical and your computer is relatively slow.
 Bilinear: This choice provides better quality and is almost as fast as Nearest
Neighbor. With this method, Photoshop looks at pixels above, below, and on either
side of the pixel being processed (four pixels in all).
 Bicubic (Better): This option is a new and improved version of the old Bicubic
method. Most users will want to stick this option, which is the default setting.
Photoshop takes a little longer to perform its calculations but generates an opti-
mized pixel after looking at 8 surrounding pixels — one above, one below, two on the
sides, and four in the corners.
 Bicubic Smoother: Like Bicubic, but provides the maximum amount of softening
between pixel edges. A good method when upsampling, or enlarging, an image. Can
slightly affect the sharpness of the resulting image.
 Bicubic Sharper: Again, like Bicubic, but applies just a little softening to pixel edges.
This is a good method when downsampling, or reducing the size, of an image.
For more on interpolation, see Book II, Chapter 1.

History States: Photoshop remembers how your document looks at various stages of
editing, storing all the image information on your hard drive and listing the individual
states in the History palette. (For more information on using the History palette, see
Book II, Chapter 4.) Keeping track of every change you make requires lots of memory
and hard drive space, so you can specify how many resources to use by typing a value
into this box. The default is 20 (the max is 1000). If you have resources to burn and fre-
quently find yourself stepping way back in time to modify or delete a step, you can type
a larger number. If your resources are skimpy and you don’t anticipate making many
changes to earlier steps (or are willing to take frequent snapshots or save interim
images), you can enter a smaller number.
In the Options section of the General Preferences dialog box, you find nearly a dozen check
boxes that you can select or deselect, as described in the following list:

Export Clipboard: When this feature is active, Photoshop transfers its private clip-
board (used only within Photoshop) to the general Windows or Macintosh Clipboard so
that you can paste information into other applications. If you activate this option,
switching from Photoshop to other applications takes a little longer, and Photoshop’s
clipboard contents replace whatever was in your system Clipboard when you switched.
The clipboard is generally a poor vehicle for moving image data between applications
because the transferred information may not be of the best quality. Instead, save your file
and open it in the other application. If you do this, you can turn off the Export Clipboard
option, saving you some time when switching between applications.

Setting Your Preferences


Show Tool Tips: Photoshop can display little pop-up reminders about tools and other
objects on your screen. If you find these reminders distracting, deselect this check box
to turn off Tool Tips. 

Zoom Resizes Windows: Select this check box if you want your document windows to
grow and shrink to fit your document as you zoom in and out. Deselect this check box
if you want the document’s window to always remain the same size; you might want to
deselect the check box if you frequently work with several documents side by side and
don’t want them to change relative size as you zoom in and out.

Auto-update Open Documents: When you’re working on an image and move to another
application (such as ImageReady) to work on the same image, you’ll probably want the
changes made in the other application to be reflected in the document still open in
Photoshop. Select this check box so that Photoshop will monitor the document and
update its version whenever the document is changed in the other application.

Show Asian Text Options: Although Photoshop supports Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean text, this option is off by default. You can activate it here so that Asian text
options become available as you work.

Beep When Done: I remember the bad old days when Photoshop would take a minute
or two to apply the Gaussian Blur filter or perform calculations when merging even
moderate-sized image layers. Photoshop wasn’t inefficient; computers a decade ago
were really slow compared to those available today. The Beep When Done signal was
my cue to stop watching television and resume working with Photoshop. Although most
operations are a lot faster today, if you’re working with very large images or simply like
to be notified when a step is finished, the beep option can be useful (or incredibly
annoying to your coworkers).

Dynamic Color Sliders: The sliders in the Color palette change colors to match the set-
tings you make. If your computer is on the slow side, you can turn off this feature to
improve performance.

Save Palette Locations: Select this check box if you want Photoshop to restore your
most recent palette locations the next time you start up. Deselect this check box if
you always want your palettes in the same location each time you begin working.

Show Font Names in English: If you’ve selected the Show Asian Text Options check
box, Photoshop can display font names in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean by turning
this option off. Activate this option if you want font names displayed only in English,
regardless of the other Asian text options you’re using.

Use Shift Key for Tool Switch: When this feature is active, you can change from one
tool in the Tools palette to another in the same group (say, to change from the Gradient
tool to the Paint Bucket tool) by pressing the Shift key and the keyboard shortcut for
that tool.

Use Smart Quotes: Love ’em or hate ’em, you can instruct Photoshop whether to use
smart (curly) quotes or plain (straight) quotes with this option.

History Log: You can have Photoshop record all your editing commands. 
This new feature is handy if you want to present a finished, fully edited image to a client or man-
ager, but need to be able to show the steps of how you got there. Or maybe you want a record
of the steps, so you can repeat them on other images and don’t want to rely on your memory.

You have a few formats in which you can save your edit history log:
 Metadata: Saving the log to metadata (information embedded in your image file)
allows you to view the log in the File Browser window. For more on the File Browser,
see Book I, Chapter 5.
 Text File: You can save the log to a text file. Click the Choose button to provide a
name and location for the file.
 Both: This option saves the log as both metadata and a text file.
 Edit Log Items: You choose Sessions Only, Concise, or Detailed. The Sessions Only
option records your editing until you close the file or quit Photoshop. The Concise
option keeps a comprehensive log (multiple sessions), but in short and sweet steps.
The Detailed option provides a comprehensive, detailed log. For example, a concise
log entry may be just Crop, whereas a detailed log entry may be Crop. To rectan-
gle and then also provide the original and cropped dimensions, the angle and the
resolution values.

Reset All Warning Dialogs: If you’ve turned off the display of certain warnings by
selecting the Don’t Show Me This Dialog Box Again check box, you can reactivate all the
warnings by clicking this button.
Deciding how you want files handled
The options in the File Handling Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-2, control how
Photoshop handles files as they are opened and closed. Here’s the lowdown on these options:
Figure 6-2


Image Previews: Storing a preview thumbnail with an image can speed up browsing for
the image you want. You can tell Photoshop to save a preview by default or to ask you
first (in case you want to create images that are a little smaller in size, especially for the
Web). Or you can also choose not to ever save a preview. Mac users need to select the
kinds of image previews they need. Select the Icon option to enable an image icon to
appear on the Desktop. Select the Macintosh Thumbnail option to see a preview in the
Open dialog box. Select the Windows Thumbnail option to see a preview in a Windows
OS. Finally, select the Full Size option to save a low-resolution version of the file to use
in applications that can open only low-resolution (72 ppi) Photoshop images.

File Extension: You can select whether the file extensions appended to filenames (such
as .psd, .tif, and so forth) are consistently uppercase or lowercase, as you prefer. On
Macs, you can choose whether to add extensions by selecting from the Always, Never,
or to Ask When Saving options. If you want cross-platform compatibility with PCs or
prep Web graphics, select the Always option. Mac users, select the Use Lower Case
option to save extensions as lowercase characters.

Ignore EXIF sRGB tag: When this option is selected, Photoshop ignores the sRGB tag
that many digital cameras add to their EXIF (camera) data. The sRGB tag is widely used,
but not well respected among many high-end digital photography professionals.

Ask Before Saving Layered TIFF Files: Photoshop can save an advanced type of TIFF
file that includes layers, exactly as with its own native PSD files. However, many applica-
tions cannot read these files. If you always open TIFF files in Photoshop and don’t mind
creating larger TIFF files in the process, you can disable this option. Otherwise,
Photoshop asks you for confirmation each time you want to save a TIFF file that con-
tains layers.

Enable Large Document Format (.psb): Photoshop can now create documents up to
300,000 x 300,000 pixels. You can save these humongous files as TIFFs (up to 4GB) or in
the new .psb or Photoshop Raw formats, with no limitation in size.

Maximize PSD File Compatibility: Photoshop now lets you choose an option for file
compatibility. 
Not all applications can handle the more sophisticated features that may be stored in a PSD
file (such as fancy layer effects). If you frequently open PSD files in applications other than
later versions of Photoshop, you may want to set this option to Always. Keep in mind that
you may lose some features when you do this. Choose Ask to have Photoshop prompt you
when you save a file as to whether you want the option. Or select Never to ignore the option
completely.
When you maximize compatibility, Photoshop saves a composite (flattened) version
along with the layered file to ensure that older applications (such as Version 2) can read
the files. However, this option also makes your file size balloon enormously. In addition,
when you save in this mode, you get an annoying warning that your file may not be read
by future versions of Photoshop. This silly warning appears every time you save a lay-
ered PSD file. 
If you plan to use your PSD files in InDesign or Illustrator, you need to have the maximize
compatibility feature turned on because those programs need to have a composite along
with the layers.

you need to share your files with others in your workgroup by using a server. 

Recent File List Contains: Type a value from 0 to 30 to specify the number of recently
used files you want displayed in the Recent File list on the File menu.
Adjusting your display and cursors
This Display & Cursors Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-3, enables you to set several
options that control how cursors display on-screen and three display parameters that may
affect how quickly your computer completes an operation. The following list describes these
options:

Color Channels in Color: When selected, this option tells Photoshop to show each of
the color channels (for example, red, green, blue or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) in
their respective colors in the Channels palette. In most cases, you won’t want to use
this feature. You need to be able to see the channels in their grayscale form to perform
image-editing tasks such as converting from color to grayscale, channel masking, or for
selective sharpening on certain channels.

Use Diffusion Dither: This option is a holdover from the days when those working with
images sometimes used graphics cards and displays that could show only 256 different
colors. With this feature active, Photoshop simulates all the colors in an image by creat-
ing mixtures of the 256 available colors in a pattern that the human eye automatically
merges together. You can use this option to work with full-color, 24-bit images in 256-
color viewing mode. However, any computer that meets the specs needed to run
Photoshop should be able to operate in full-color display mode.

Use Pixel Doubling: Many dialog boxes and tools have preview windows that show the
effect of the settings you’re working with. With this feature active, Photoshop doubles
the size of the pixels in the preview only, reducing the resolution of the preview but
speeding display.

Painting and Other Cursors: Choose the Standard option to show a tool’s cursor as an
icon representing the tool itself (although I don’t know why you’d want to do this). Use
Precise to switch to a cursor that has crosshairs, which is useful for positioning the
center of a tool’s operational area in a particular place. Brush Size (available for painting
tools only) tells Photoshop to show the cursor in the same size as the brush itself. Most
users prefer to set the painting cursors to Brush Size and the other cursors to Precise.
Some folks do complain that precise cursors are hard to see against some backgrounds,
but you can always press the Caps Lock key to toggle precise cursors on or off.
Adjusting transparency and gamut
Photoshop uses colors and patterns to represent information about an image that is
normally invisible, such as areas that are transparent, or parts of an image that contain colors
that cannot be represented by your current display or printing system. The Transparency &
Gamut Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-4, enables you to tailor these displays to
your own preferences.
For example, transparency is typically shown on the screen by using a gray-and-white
checkerboard pattern. You can change the pattern and colors if you prefer another type of
display.

Here is a rundown of the options you find in this dialog box:

Grid Size: You can choose small, medium, large, or no grid at all. You may want to
switch from the default medium-sized grid to a large grid if you’re using a very high-
resolution setting (such as the 1920 x 1440 pixel setting I use on my monitor) so the grid
is a little easier to see. (I don’t bother with this, myself.) Or you can switch to a smaller
grid if you’re working at a 640 x 480 or an 800 x 600 resolution.

Grid Colors: The default light grid is the least obtrusive, but you can switch to a
medium or dark grid if you want. Also, you are not limited to gray-and-white checker-
board squares. To choose custom colors, double-click the white and gray squares
below the Grid Colors list.

Use Video Alpha: If you have a video board that supports chroma keying, select this
option to be able to view video in the transparent portions behind a layer.

Gamut Warning: You can adjust the color used to represent out-of-gamut colors and to
specify the transparency for the warning color. Double-click the Color box to set the
hue and choose the transparency with the Opacity slider. The gamut warning is gener-
ally used before converting RGB images to CMYK to see which colors will be lost. For
more information on color gamuts, see Book II, Chapter 2.
A gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed or printed. In Photoshop talk, out-of-gamut
colors generally are those that can’t be represented by cyan, magenta, yellow, and black and,
therefore, can’t be printed. To turn gamut warnings on or off, choose View➪Gamut Warning.
Setting measurement preferences
In the Units & Rulers Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5, you can set the units used 
to measure things on-screen (inches, pixels, millimeters, and so forth) and to define a default
column size when typing text in multiple columns. In addition, you can define the resolution of
the image when you choose File➪New and select Default Photoshop Size from the Preset Sizes
list. (See Book I, Chapter 3, for more on preset sizes.)
Figure 6-5

Setting Your Preferences
109
In the Units area of the dialog box, you find these options:

Rulers: Select the measurement units Photoshop uses for rulers. Your choices are
pixels, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, or percent. The most popular
sizes are inches and millimeters, but if you’re working with publications and specifying
in picas, you might prefer that increment instead. If you’re prepping Web graphics, you
may prefer to have your rulers incremented in pixels.

Type: Choose the measurement used to represent the dimensions of type. Point size is
almost universally used, but pixels and millimeters are also available. You may want to
use pixels if you’re trying to fit type into a specific-sized area of an image.
In the Column Size area, you can specify the following:

Width: The width of the column in inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, or picas.

Gutter: The width of the area separating columns, also in inches, centimeters, millime-
ters, points, or picas.
In the New Document Preset Resolutions area, you can set the following:

Print Resolution: The default is 300 pixels per inch, a good setting to keep. You can
change to another value and use pixels per centimeter as a measurement if you want.

Screen Resolution: Generally, 72 pixels per inch works with most images that will be
prepped for screen viewing. You can select another resolution and use pixels per cen-
timeter if you like.
Changing the resolution of an image after it’s been created can impact the sharpness of your
image and degrade quality. It’s best to choose the final resolution you want when you create
a document, whether you specify the resolution manually or use these presets.
In the Point/Pica Size area, you can choose whether you want to use a measurement of 72
points per inch (which first became relevant in the Macintosh realm and spread as desktop
publishing became widespread) or the traditional 72.27 points per inch definition used in the
precomputer era. Unless you have a special reason to choose otherwise, use the Postscript
(72 points per inch) option.
Setting up guides, grids, and slices
Guides are nonprinting lines you can create on your screen to make it easier to align objects.
Grids are vertical and horizontal lines in the background that make lining up objects even easier.
Slices are sections of an image you can create for Web page graphics so that each slice can be
loaded and treated separately (usually in a table or similar arrangement). For more information
on using grids and guides, see Book I, Chapter 5. For a full explanation of slices, check out
Book IX, Chapter 3. Figure 6-6 shows the Guides, Grid & Slices Preferences dialog box.

In the Guides area, you can set these options:

Color: Either select a color from the drop-down list or click the color sample swatch to
choose your own color. You may want to change the default color if that color is too
similar to a dominant color in your image.

Style: Select from lines or dashed lines. If you work with images that contain many hori-
zontal and vertical lines that extend across most of an image, dashed lines may be more
visible.
In the Grid area, these are your options:

Color: Select a color from the drop-down list or click the color sample patch to define
a specific hue.

Style: You can choose lines, dashed lines, or dots.

Gridline Every: Choose the distance between gridlines.

Subdivisions: Select the number of subdivisions for each gridline.
In the Slices area, these are your choices:

Line Color: From the drop-down list, choose a color for the lines that surround
each slice.

Show Slice Numbers: If you select this check box, Photoshop adds a slice number to
the display of slices, which makes it easier to keep track of individual slices.

Plug-Ins and Scratch Disks
111
Plug-Ins and Scratch Disks
Plug-ins and scratch disks are a couple of unrelated options combined in a single dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-7. Briefly, plug-ins are mini software programs that add features to
Photoshop. Scratch disks are free areas on your hard drive(s) that Photoshop uses as virtual
memory when it is short on RAM. Read on to find out more.
Plug-ins
The Plug-Ins folder is where Photoshop stores all your filters and other plug-in add-ons. A
default folder is created when you install Photoshop.
Photoshop allows you to specify an additional folder to search other than its own Plug-Ins
folder. This additional folder may come in handy if you want to keep your third-party add-ons
separate from Photoshop’s native plug-ins. An auxiliary plug-ins directory (not nested within
Photoshop’s own Plug-Ins folder) can simplify managing those extra filters, and you can turn
off their use (potentially speeding up Photoshop’s load time) by deselecting the Additional
Plug-Ins Folder check box in this dialog box. You can also use this option when you have some
plug-ins installed for another application and want to share them with Photoshop without
having to make extra copies in your Photoshop Plug-Ins directory.
To activate a new plug-ins directory, select the Additional Plug-Ins Folder check box and then
click the Choose button. In the dialog box that appears, navigate to the folder you want to use
and select it. Click OK. You then need to exit Photoshop and restart the program to activate
the new directory.
Figure 6-7
Book
I
Chapter
6

Book I  Chapter 6: Customizing Your Workspace and Preferences
112
If you have a plug-in or folder you’d like to deactivate, use a tilde (~) as the first character of
the plug-in or folder name. Photoshop will ignore the plug-in(s) or folder(s) specified. Just
remove the tilde from the name to activate the plug-in or folder. This can come in handy if
you are having a program glitch and want to deactivate your plug-ins to troubleshoot
whether or not they are causing the problem.
Scratch disks
Scratch disks are areas on your hard drive that Photoshop uses to substitute for physical
RAM when you don’t have enough RAM to work with the images you have opened. Scratch
disks are no replacement for physical memory, but there are many times when Photoshop
will need them, even if you have huge amounts of memory.
Photoshop uses your startup drive (the drive used to boot your operating system) as its first
scratch disk by default. That may not be the best choice because your startup drive is usually
pretty busy handling requests of your operating system and, if you’re running Windows,
requests for Windows’ own virtual memory scheme (your so-called swap file or paging file).
Ideally, your scratch disk(s) should be a different hard drive and, preferably, the fastest one
you have available.
If you have more than one hard drive, choose one other than your startup drive as your first
scratch disk. Select your fastest drive; for example, select a FireWire (IEEE 1394) or USB 2.0
drive over one using the original, slow, USB 1.1 connection. If you have an Ultra-DMA EIDE
drive or, better yet, a SCSI drive, use that. Although Ultra-DMA drives have transfer rates that
rival even the speediest SCSI models, SCSI can be better because the SCSI bus is designed for
multitasking. You’ll often get better performance than with an EIDE drive that shares one of
the two EIDE channels with other devices.
If you don’t have a second hard drive, you can improve scratch disk performance by creating
a partition on an existing drive for use as a scratch disk. Remember to keep the scratch disk
defragmented (that is, with the files all organized together on your hard drive) by using your
favorite defragmentation utility. See Book I, Chapter 1, for information on how you can moni-
tor how much scratch disk space you have available and how it is being used. 
Adobe changed the format for serial numbers with Photoshop 7, and if you have old plug-
ins that require a valid Photoshop serial number, you can enter the serial number from an
older version into the space provided in this dialog box.
Changing Memory and Cache Settings
The perennial question: How much memory does Photoshop require? The perennial answer:
As much as you can cram into your computer! Memory is so inexpensive right now there’s no
excuse for not having at least 512MB of RAM, and more is even better if you’re using an oper-
ating system that can handle extra memory efficiently, such as Windows XP and Mac OS X.
When you’ve crammed your RAM, you’ll want to make sure Photoshop can use as much as
you can spare. You can use the Memory & Image Cache Preferences dialog box, shown in
Figure 6-8, to allocate your memory.

The Memory & Image Cache
Preferences dialog box opens.
2.
In the Memory Usage area, change
the Maximum Used by Photoshop
parameter.
Use a value of 50 to 80 percent,
depending on how much memory you
have to waste. Allocating more to
Photoshop reduces the RAM for other
applications, so if you have other pro-
grams that need lots of memory,
choose a prudent value.
3.
Click OK to apply the option.
4.
Exit Photoshop and relaunch the pro-
gram to activate the new setting.
Setting aside memory for storing screen images
You can also set aside the amount of memory for storing screen images in the Memory &
Image Cache dialog box, to speed up redraws of a reduced-view image on your screen as you
make changes. You have two options. You can specify the number of copies of your image
stored in memory, from the default value of 4 up to 8 levels. You can also set aside cache
memory for drawing histograms (brightness graphs produced by the Levels command) if you
use histograms frequently.

Setting File Browser Preferences
Photoshop CS has added a new set of preferences for the File Browser. These preferences
enable you to customize how the newly souped-up File Browser processes and displays your
images. For details on setting the File Browser preferences, see the section, “Managing
Images with the File Browser,” in Book I, Chapter 5.
Using the Preset Manager
Many of the palettes and tools Photoshop works with can use settings that you store on your
hard drive as presets. For example, you can create custom colors and brush tips, build your
own gradients, create a library of shapes, or compile a set of styles to apply to layers.
You’ll want to become familiar with the Preset Manager, which provides a central management
tool for all the options that are individually available from the palettes and tools themselves.
Just as with the tools, you can select, edit, and delete presets. The only thing you can’t do
with the Preset Manager is actually create a preset. You must do this with the Tool Preset
picker or Tool Presets palettes. For more details, see Book I, Chapter 2. Here are some tips on
using the Preset Manager, shown with its pop-up menu in Figure 6-9:

To show the Preset Manager, choose Edit➪Preset Manager. To hide it, click Done.

To select a specific type of preset to work with, choose it from the Preset Type drop-
down list.

To modify a preset, choose the option from the pop-up menu available in each preset’s
dialog box. Click on the right pointing arrow to the left of the Done button to access the
preset pop-up menu.

To load an existing set of presets from your hard drive, click the Load button and navi-
gate to the presets you want to access. You can also choose a preset library listed
under the pop-up menu of each preset type.

To store a new or modified group of settings, click the Save Set button and type a name.

To give a particular preset a new name, select the setting in the dialog box, click the
Rename button, and type the new name.
You can rename multiple settings consecutively by clicking and Shift+clicking the items to
be renamed and then clicking the Rename button. Photoshop asks you to supply a new
name for each, in turn.

To quickly load the default preset library for any tool or palette, choose Reset [name]
Preset from the Preset Manager pop-up menu. You can also replace your current Preset
library with another.

Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts
For those of you who are like me — I avoid using a mouse and prefer the ease and speed of
keyboard shortcuts — Photoshop now offers customizable keyboard shortcuts. You can
assign shortcuts to menu commands, palette commands, and tools. You can edit, delete, or
add to the Photoshop default set or create your own custom set. Here are the steps to work
with keyboard shortcuts:
Book

1.
Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts. 
For those who have good manual dex-
terity, you can also press
Alt+Shift+Ctrl+K (Option+Shift+Ô+K).
The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box
appears, shown in Figure 6-10.
b Choose between the Photoshop
Defaults set or create a new set by
clicking the New Set button (the dog-
eared page icon) in the upper-right
corner of the dialog box.
Clicking New Set makes a copy of the
selected set for you to then edit and
customize. If you choose a new set,
name the set (leaving it with a .kys
extension), and keep it stored in the
Keyboard Shortcuts folder.
c Choose Application Menus, Palette
Menus, or Tools from the Shortcuts
For drop-down list.
4.
Select your desired command from
the list. Type in the shortcut keys you
want to assign to that command in the
shortcut field. If you type a keyboard
shortcut that is already assigned to
that command, you can simply type
over it.
As you well know, Photoshop often has
multiple ways of accessing the same
command. For example, you can create
a new layer by using the Layers palette
pop-up menu or buttons or by choos-
ing the menu command Layer➪New➪
Layer. Therefore, you may get a warn-
ing that your chosen command and
another command on another menu
must have the same shortcut and
that changes will be applied to both
commands.

If you later change your mind and want
to use the original keyboard shortcut
(if there was one), click Use Default. If
you decide you don’t want the shortcut
at all, click Delete Shortcut. And if you
make a mistake, just click Undo.
Application and Palette menu commands
must include a Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and/or
an F key in the keyboard shortcut.
f When you finish, click the Save Set
button (the disk icon). 
If you want to delete the set, click the

Image Essentials


P
hotoshop has evolved into a Swiss Army knife. Once only
a pixel-based (or raster) application designed primarily for
print, it has been transformed into a program capable of
both vector- and pixel-based output with added features aimed
at producing Web content as well. 
You need to be aware of important issues when you produce both
pixel-based and vector-based graphics. I give you a bit of back-
ground in that department in this chapter. Also, I show you the
components that make up the physical aspect of your pixel-based
image — the dimensions, the file size, and the resolution — and
how they relate to one another. 
Even though Photoshop can now produce vector graphics,
its primary mission is to create awe-inspiring raster images.
And because the issue of resolution is so critical to raster
images, this chapter primarily discusses methods for sizing
and resizing raster images. I cover producing vector art in
more detail in Book IV, Chapter 2.
You find out how to change any of the three components with-
out harming your image. Yes, you can harm your image. Not
intentionally, of course. But it can happen quicker than you can
close a dialog box. But with a firm understanding of how pixels
live and breathe, you can ensure that your images are safe from
any undue damage.
Putting Images under the Microscope
Digital images fall into two camps, vector images, which are cre-
ated based on mathematical formulas, and raster images, which
are made up of pixels. Photoshop allows you to produce both
types of images and even to combine both types within a
single file.

Vector images
One cool thing about vector images, also called object-oriented images, is that when you
zoom in on them, they don’t look blocky. That’s because vector images are comprised of
segments — curved or straight — and anchor points — elements that indicate the endpoints
of the segments — that are defined by mathematical objects called vectors. Vectors use a
unique mathematical formula to define the specific location of an object as well as its
geometric shape.
Vector images are usually the product of drawing programs, such as Adobe Illustrator, but
Photoshop is also capable of producing a vector or two. And not to be outdone, its cousin
Illustrator can also rasterize (or convert into pixels) vector artwork, thereby providing you
with raster images to work with.
Here is some additional information about vector graphics:

A curve is still a curve, even at 20,000 feet. Because they are mathematically defined,
vector graphics can be sized and otherwise transformed without an inkling of quality loss.
Take that little 2-inch spot illustration and size it up to mural size, and it appears identical.
A perfect true curve remains a perfect true curve, whether it’s 2 inches or 20 feet long.

You can get pretty pictures in small packages. Vector images can be small in file size
because the file size depends on the complexity of the vector objects, not the size of
the illustration.
Graphics that need clean lines, such as logos, typographic illustrations, and line art, work
great in vector format, such as my logo, shown in Figure 1-1.

Vector images are independent — resolution independent, that is. Not only can they
be transformed and printed without a degradation in quality, but they also have no
built-in resolution — they take on the resolution of the output device. For example,
print my logo in Figure 1-1 to an imagesetter (a high-end printing device used for color
separations) at 2400 dots per inch (dpi), and the image comes out at 2400 dpi. Print it to
a 300 dpi laser printer and what do you get? A 300 dpi image. (If all this technical lingo
like imagesetter and dpi is confusing, it might help to skim over Book X, Chapter 2.)
Because your monitor can display images only on a grid, vector images display on-screen as
pixels. This accounts for the jagged appearance you see when you zoom into a curved
vector object. But don’t worry; it will print just fine.

Putting Images under the Microscope
121
Raster images
Raster images are usually the result of the digitizing of continuous-tone images, such as
photographs or original painted or drawn artwork. Raster images are comprised of a grid of
squares, which are called pixels. Pixel is short for PICture Element and is the smallest compo-
nent of a digital image. If you’ve ever looked at a bathroom wall made up of those small square
tiles reminiscent of the ’40s, you’re familiar with what a grid of pixels looks like: Each pixel
lives in a specific location on that grid and contains a single color. When you edit a bitmap
image, you are editing one or more pixels rather than an object-oriented shape.
Although it doesn’t seem like it when you’re viewing an image that fits inside your computer
screen, your entire image can be broken down into a grid of square pixels. That means the
elliptical shapes of my beanie, shown in Figure 1-2, also have to fit within this system of
squares. But how do you fit a round peg in a square hole? By faking it. Unlike the true
mathematical curve possible when drawing vector shapes, raster images must try to
approximate a curve by mimicking the overall shape with square pixels. 
Fortunately, the mimicry the pixels have to do is indecipherable with high-resolution images
viewed at a reasonable distance. But when you zoom in, you can see that a curve in an image
(like the curve of my beanie) is indeed comprised of square pixels. Raster graphics work great
for photorealistic or painterly images where subtle gradations of color are necessary. On the
downside, because they contain a fixed number of pixels, raster graphics can suffer a degrada-
tion of quality when they’re enlarged or otherwise transformed. They are also large in file size.
Figure 1-1

Book II  Chapter 1: Specifying Size and Resolution
122
Bitmap images are resolution dependent. Because they contain a fixed number of pixels, the
resolution of the device they are being printed to is only one of two factors that influence the
quality of the image. The quality of the output also depends heavily on the resolution of the
image. For example, an image with 72 dots per inch (dpi) doesn’t look any better printed on
a 600 dpi printer than it does on a 1200 dpi printer. Likewise, a 300 dpi image doesn’t look
as good printed on an old 72 dpi dot matrix printer as it does on a 1200 dpi printer.
Viewing Raster Images On-Screen
Resolution really doesn’t play a role in how you view images on-screen. The display of images
on-screen is based on 1 image pixel per 1 screen pixel.
The most important issue, then, is making sure that your image fits inside your (or your
audience’s) monitor when viewed at 100%. This is where pixel dimensions come into play —
especially if you’re putting images on the Web. 
When you view an image on-screen, the display size is determined by the pixel dimension,
plus the size and setting of the monitor. You therefore need to determine the demographics
of your audience and then size your graphics accordingly.

A 17-inch monitor probably displays 1024 by 788 pixels. An 800 x 600 pixel image fills
part of the screen. Change the monitor setting to 800 x 600, and the image fills the
screen, with each pixel appearing larger.
On a 15-inch monitor, an 800 x 600 pixel image fills the screen. But a 1024 x 768 image
can’t be viewed in its entirety. 
You may also hear monitor resolution being referred to in graphic display standards, such as
VGA (640 x 480 pixels), XGA (1024 x 768 pixels), UXGA (1600 x 1200), and so on.
Figure 1-2

Viewing Raster Images On-Screen
123
Resolution is measured in pixels per inch, or ppi. You may also run across the term samples
per inch (spi). Another term you will see often is dots per inch (dpi). Dots per inch is always
used in reference to printers, scanners, imagesetters, and other paper-outputting devices.
You may hear people refer to dpi as printer resolution.
Book
II
Chapter
1
Every raster image has these physical attributes —
resolution, dimension, and size. Size takes on two
personalities. You have the file size, which is a
result of the pixel dimensions, and you have print
size, which is the width and height of an image.
These attributes are interrelated. Change any
one and at least one of the other attributes is
affected also.
The file size of a raster image is determined by
the pixel dimensions — the number of pixels
along the height and width of the image. The fol-
lowing figure shows a Photoshop dialog box that
lists all the vital statistics of an image that takes up
176K of space and is 200 pixels wide and 300
pixels high. Just multiply these values:
200 x 300 = 60,000 pixels contained in the
image
How do 60,000 pixels lend a file size of 176K?
60,000 × 3 = 180,000
180,000 ÷ 1024 = 176
There are 3 bytes in a 24-bit color image. Multiply
3 bytes by 60,000 pixels, and the result is 180,000
pixels. Divide 180,000 pixels by 1024 bytes per
kilobyte, and you get the file size value of 176K.
Remember: These are the basics that affect file
size, but other factors contribute to size as well,
such as layers and channels. For more on layers,
see Book V, and for details on channels, see
Book VI.
Resolution is usually measured in pixels per
linear inch (ppi), although it can also be meas-
ured in pixels per millimeter. The image in my
example has a resolution of 120 pixels per inch
(ppi), or 14,400 pixels, which just happens to be
120 x 120, or 1202.
The dimensions of an image are its width and
height when it is printed. To calculate these
dimensions, all you have to do is divide the
number of pixels by the image’s resolution:
200 ÷ 120 ppi = 1.667 inches (image width in
print)
300 ÷ 120 ppi = 2.5 inches (image height in
print)
Another way of calculating how much resolution
an image requires is by multiplying the desired
print size by the printer resolution. In other words,
to print a 5-x-7-inch image at 300 dpi requires a
resolution of 1500 x 2100 pixels per inch.
Resolution, dimension, and size in raster images

Book II  Chapter 1: Specifying Size and Resolution

You’ll see recommended resolution settings somewhere between 72 ppi and 96 ppi even
though resolution isn’t really a factor in preparing screen images. That’s just because moni-
tors display somewhere in the 72 to 96 ppi range. So if you change the physical dimensions of
an image, then it is always at a one to one ratio with the monitor. If you view an image whose
resolution is higher than that of the monitor, the image appears larger on-screen than in its
printed state. For example, try opening (or dragging and dropping) a 300 pixel-per-inch (ppi)
JPEG file into a browser window. It explodes on your screen. Because the monitor can display
only 72 to 96 ppi, it needs a ton of space to show all the pixels in the image.

Using the Image Size Command
A time will come when you need to mess with the resolution or dimensions of an image. You
may want to change the file size, or you may simply need to make sure that the resolution is
appropriate for printing or some other paper output. Or you need to adjust the dimensions so
that they’re just right for viewing on-screen. And sometimes — only sometimes — you may
need to add or delete pixels. 
Or you need to change the width, height, and/or resolution of your image for printing or some
other kind of output. Photoshop, being the powerhouse that it is, certainly allows you to do
so with the Image Size command found on the Image menu.
Follow these steps to resize your image:
1.
Open the image and then choose
Image➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 1-3. This is where the
magic happens.
b Note the current pixel dimensions of
your image and the resulting file size.
Mine shows 1536 pixels in width and
1024 pixels in height for a file size
of 4.5M.
c Also note your current document size.
This is the size of your image when it
prints on paper. Mine shows a width of
21.333 inches and a height of 14.222
inches with a resolution of 72 ppi. A
resolution of 72 ppi isn’t adequate for
printing purposes. I will be able to see
some pixelation (visible little squares)
on my printout. Therefore, I need to
reduce the size of the image so that my
total pixels are spread out over a smaller
area, making them more densely packed.
d Make sure that the Resample Image
check box is deselected and then
enter a new value for the width in the
Document Size area.
Don’t worry about the definition of
resample; I explain it in the next section.
I entered a value of 5.12 inches. Note
how my height value automatically
changed to 3.413, as shown in Figure
1-4. That’s because the Constrain
Proportions check box is selected, as
indicated by the chain and bracket icon.
Notice that the check box is also grayed
out. If the Resample Image option is
deselected, the Constrain Proportions
option is unavailable. Nine times out of
ten, you’re probably going to want your
image to stay proportional. You can also
change your units of measurement by
choosing from the pop-up menu.
e Note how the resolution automatically
changed based on what you entered
in Steps 3 and 4.
In my example, my resolution went
from 72 ppi to 300 ppi. When you do
not have Resample Image selected,
your pixel dimensions remain

unchangeable (note how there is no
text box for you to enter new pixel
dimension values). Therefore, when
you enter a smaller width or height
value, the resolution must increase in
order to accommodate all the pixels
in the image. Similarly, if you enter a
new resolution value (rather than a
width value as I did), Photoshop then
adjusts the width and height values in
order to accomplish the same thing.
Before you close this dialog box, I would
be remiss in not telling you about the
Auto button. This is Photoshop’s way of
giving you a suggested resolution setting
based on your screen frequency. Don’t
worry about it for now. But if you feel the
burning need to know about screen fre-
quencies, check out Book X, Chapter 2. 
Again, before you click OK, I want to fill
you in one new option. The Scale Styles
option allows you to scale or not scale any
effects or styles that you have applied to
your layer(s). Note that this option is avail-
able only if you have checked Constrain
Proportions.
6.
Click OK.
You won’t notice any difference in the
way your image appears on-screen
because you haven’t added or deleted
any pixels; you’ve merely compacted
them into a smaller space.
Congratulations! You have just safely
resized your image. You can proudly
say, “No pixels were harmed in the
making of this image.”

Resampling Images
Resampling means you are changing the pixel dimensions of an image. When you downsample
(or resample down), you are eliminating pixels and therefore deleting information and detail
from your image. When you resample up (or upsampling), you are adding pixels. Photoshop
adds these pixels by using interpolation. Interpolation means Photoshop analyzes the colors
of the original pixels and “manufactures” new ones, which are then added to the existing ones.
You can specify the interpolation method in the Image Size dialog box. The default that
appears in the dialog box is based on the interpolation method you specified in your General
Preferences dialog box. Here are your five choices:

Nearest Neighbor: This method is fast and provides for the smallest file size, but it is
less precise and therefore of the lowest quality. This method works by copying the
color of the nearest pixel. It can result in jagged edges, so use it only for images with
non-anti-aliased edges (hard edges).

Bilinear: Considered a medium-quality method, it works by averaging the color of the
pixel above, below, and to the right and left of each pixel.

Bicubic: This method is the slowest but most precise. It averages the color of the pixel
above and below and the two on the right and left of each pixel. It provides a smoother
transition between pixels but also increases the contrast between pixels to reduce
blurriness.

Bicubic Smoother: Like Bicubic, but provides an even smoother transition between
pixels and therefore increases the amount of blurriness. A good method to use when
upsampling images. Can slightly affect the sharpness of the image.

Bicubic Sharper: Also similar to Bicubic, but applies less anti-aliasing and therefore less
blurriness as well. This method applies just a little softening to pixel edges. This is a
good method when downsampling an image.
Bicubic Smoother and Bicubic Sharper are new to Photoshop CS.
If you really must resample, I recommend leaving the method set to Bicubic Smoother. Notice I
said if you really must. Here are some reasons why you might choose to add or delete pixels:

You no longer have access to the original artwork, which you could rescan at the
proper resolution and size.

You no longer have access to the original high-resolution version of the file.

You absolutely cannot substitute the low-resolution image with another of higher
resolution.
Resampling isn’t a recommended activity, especially when it pertains to upsampling. I mean
as smart as Photoshop is, having to manufacture pixels out of the blue is not an exact sci-
ence. Your image tends to lose detail and sharpness and get blurry and mushy. The bottom
line is your resampled image never looks as good as the original. Downsampling isn’t as
scary. Even though you are deleting pixels, and therefore detail, the degradation is virtually
undetectable with the eye.

Adding pixels to an image
To add pixels to an image, follow these steps:
Book
II
Chapter
1
1.
With your desired image open, first
choose Image➪Duplicate to make a
copy of your original. With the dupli-
cate active, choose Image➪Image Size.
See Figure 1-5.
This is where the havoc happens. 
Be careful!
b Make sure that the Resample Image
option is selected.
c Enter a higher value for the resolu-
tion, and if desired, enter a higher
value for the width or height.
I entered a resolution of 300 ppi and a
width of 8 inches. 
Note how the pixel dimensions
increased dramatically as did the file
size (from a mere 149K to 10.9M), as
shown in Figure 1-6.
The Width and Height under Pixel
Dimensions are now text boxes into
which you can enter values as well.
They are no longer fixed values as
they were when Resample Image was
deselected.
Leave your Interpolation method set to
Bicubic.
If you get all discombobulated when
working in the dialog box, press Alt
(Option on the Mac). The Cancel button
will change to a Reset button. Click it, and
you’re back to where you started.
4.
Click OK.
Photoshop now goes through its inter-
polation ritual and churns out a newly
resampled image. Do a side-by-side
comparison to the original, looking at
both at 100% view. Your original should
look better than the resampled image.
Notice the overall blurriness and goopy
edges that are an unfortunate side effect
of interpolation, as shown in Figure 1-7.

Taking pixels out of an image
As I mention earlier, when you downsample you eliminate pixels and therefore delete informa-
tion and detail from your image. Although I have emphasized the pitfalls of resampling up, you
can sometimes damage your image by downsampling, as well.
Granted, downsampling is sometimes necessary when converting high-resolution print graph-
ics into Web graphics. For example, you may be forced to take images used for a corporate
brochure and repurpose them into content for the company’s Web site. You probably won’t
notice much degradation in image quality because the images are just being viewed on-screen.
In addition, downsampling can occasionally camouflage the moiré patterns caused by scan-
ning halftones (for more on halftones, check out Book VII, Chapter 1). However, you can down-
sample to the extreme where the images look horrid even on-screen, as shown in Figure 1-8.
But just remember, you should never need to make an image smaller than 72 ppi.

Here are some tips and tricks to keep in mind
when you’re messing around with image size
and resolution settings:
 Use the Unsharp Mask filter when you
resample. If you resample your image,
either up or down, it is sometimes helpful to
apply an Unsharp Mask filter (choose
Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask). This filter
heightens the contrast between pixels to give
the illusion of sharpening or forcing the
image more in focus.
 You can always look without touching.
If you don’t want to change the resolution or
size of your image, but just get its vital statis-
tics, use the file information box at the bottom
of the application window (document window
on the Mac). Press Alt (Option on the Mac)
and click your mouse button over the file
information box. You can see the width,
height, channels (see Book VI, Chapter 1), and
resolution of the document.
 Don’t change your settings — just use
Print with Preview. If you want to leave
the size and resolution settings untouched,
but need to print your image at a different
size, use the Print with Preview command.
For details on Print with Preview, see Book I,
Chapter 4.
 Try starting out with the proper dimen-
sions. It goes without saying, but I’ll say it
anyway. You want to try to enter the proper
dimensions and resolution when creating a
new document. You don’t want to find your-
self in the unfortunate situation of creating
your file at 72 ppi, spending hours getting it
just perfect and then remembering that you
were supposed to prep it for print and really
needed it to be 300 ppi. Resampling your
image from 72 ppi to 300 ppi is going to
make it go from perfect to, well, far less than
that. And when scanning an image, make sure
that you scan it at a high enough resolution
that if you need to enlarge the dimensions,
you can do so without changing the pixel
dimensions. See Book X, Chapter 2, for more
details on prepping an image for print.
 Don’t use a higher resolution than you
need. All you do is create an unnecessarily
huge file with a slower print time. In addition,
the output device may not be able to repro-
duce all the detail in the image. In some
cases, it may actually make your printout look
darker and muddier.
 Look no further than this book. Use the
handy, dandy table of recommended resolu-
tion settings for a variety of output devices in
Book X, Chapter 2.

If you have to downsample your image significantly, for example to 25% of its original size,
you get better results if you do several successive 50% downsamples, applying a Unsharp
Mask filter on the image in between each image sizing. For more on the Unsharp Mask filter,
see Book VII, Chapter 1.
To remove pixels from an image, follow the steps in the preceding section and change the
image settings accordingly.
Resizing Images with the Resize Image Wizard
You find the Resize Image Wizard (Resize Image Assistant on the Mac) on the Help menu on
the Photoshop menu bar. When selected, the Wizard/Assistant dialog box appears and asks
you questions about your intended use for the image. The wizard/assistant then guides you
through the image-sizing process. If you happen to choose options that the wizard doesn’t
like, you get a warning that your changes are likely to lower your image quality. You can then
go back and try another setting.
The Resize Image Wizard is more for beginners and doesn’t offer quite the control that the
Image Size dialog box does. In addition, you can’t see all your options on one screen and must
continually go back and forth between screens when entering different values.
When you finish changing settings and choosing options, the wizard/assistant creates a new
file called Resize Wizard_1 (Resize Assistant 1 on the Mac), leaving your original
unharmed. Like any kind of wizard, this one is pretty savvy, but I recommend having a firm
understanding of proper output resolution (see the beginning of this chapter for info on that
topic) before you use the wizard/assistant. And actually with that firm understanding, you can
do manually everything the wizard/assistant can do and more. Remember the old adage,
knowledge is power.
Although using the Resize Image Wizard is fine, try to avoid using File➪Automate➪Fit
Image. When I see a dialog box having to do with image sizing that only contains two text
boxes, it’s an immediate red flag! This command resizes your file as close to your entered
dimensions as possible, while maintaining the same proportions. But in order to do so,
Photoshop enlarges or decreases your image while leaving the resolution the same. And if
you’ve read earlier sections of this chapter, you know this is also called resampling — not a
nice thing in image-editing circles.

Changing the Canvas Size
I’ve probably harped on you to the point that you’re slightly paranoid, or at least ultraconscious,
of using the Image Size command. Well, you can relax now because the Canvas Size command is

Changing the Canvas Size

as safe as can be. Unlike the Image Size command, which enlarges or reduces the dimensions
or resolution of your image, the Canvas Size command merely changes the size of the canvas,
or page, on which the image sits. 
When you increase the size of the canvas, Photoshop fills the expanded area outside the
image with your chosen color. Increasing your canvas size can come in handy if you are trying
to add a frame or border around your image. If you make the canvas smaller, Photoshop crops
(cuts away) the image.
Here are the quick and easy steps to changing your canvas size:
Book
II
Chapter
1
CONTINUED
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
1.
Choose Image➪Canvas Size.
The Canvas Size dialog box, shown in
Figure 1-9, appears. The current size of
your canvas appears at the top of the
dialog box.
b Enter new values in the Width and
Height text boxes.
You can also change the unit of meas-
urement by using the pop-up menus.
Select the Relative check box to specify
an amount of space for Photoshop to
add around your image. This feature is
handy when adding equal amounts of
canvas around images with fractional
measurements.
c Specify your desired anchor placement.
The anchor shows how the image sits
inside the canvas. By default, Photoshop
centers the image and adds the canvas
around it. Click any of the other eight
squares to have Photoshop add the
canvas asymmetrically around the
image, as shown in Figure 1-10.
If you reduce either the Width or
Height value and click OK, an alert box
appears asking if you really want to
proceed because you will be clipping
the image. This is actually another way
of cropping an image, albeit not one
you will use everyday. Photoshop has
more exact ways of cropping an image
(see the next section). However, this
method can occasionally come in
handy when you want to crop your
image on one or more sides by a cer-
tain number of pixels. For example,
sometimes cropping (using the Crop
tool described in the next section) a
one- or two-pixel-wide row or column
along the edge of an image is difficult.
In this case, use the Canvas Size com-
mand and specify a value for the Width
and/or Height that is a couple of pixels
smaller than your original. Pesky prob-
lem solved.
4.
Choose your canvas color from the
Canvas Extension color pop-up menu
and click OK.
No longer do you have to be diligent in
selecting a background color before you
initiate the canvas size command.
Photoshop now offers you the option of
choosing the color you want for your
newly expanded canvas. Choose from
Foreground, Background, White, Black,
Gray or Other. If you select Other,
Photoshop transports you to the Color
Picker where you can choose any color
you desire. Note that the small swatch to
the right of the pop-up menu displays the
current background color. You can also
click this swatch to access the Color Picker.

Cropping an Image
Even a novice photographer knows that cropping an image can make a composition stronger.
Cropping entails cutting away background clutter or endless expanses of empty space in order
to focus in on your desired subject.
This simple process can transform a ho-hum photograph into a visually exciting one. Take a
look at my example in Figure 1-11. I mean, it doesn’t take an Ansel Adams to figure out which
image is stronger. (It would be even better if the fence weren’t in the background, but hey,
that’s nothing that a little Photoshop retouching can’t take care of. Check out Book VIII; it’s
all about retouching and restoration techniques.)

Using the Crop tool
The most popular way to crop an image is by using the Crop tool. This simple tool is as easy
and effective to use as a T square and X-ACTO knife, and without the possibility of bodily
injury. Select the Crop tool or press C on the keyboard and then follow these steps:
Figure 1-11
1.
With the Crop tool, drag around the
part of the image you want to keep
and then release your mouse button.
As you drag, a marquee (a dotted out-
line) appears displaying the cropping
boundaries. Don’t worry if your crop-
ping marquee isn’t exactly correct. You
can adjust it in the next step.
Notice how the area outside the crop-
ping marquee appears darker than the
inside, in order to better frame your
image. Adobe calls this a shield. You
control the color and opacity (the
amount of transparency) of the shield
by adjusting the settings in the Options
bar. If, for some strange reason, you
don’t want the shield, deselect the
check box. Figure 1-12 shows a great
example of way too much background
clutter. I dragged around the only thing
I want to retain — my daughter. 
2.
Adjust the cropping marquee by drag-
ging the handles.
The small squares on the sides and cor-
ners of the cropping marquee are called
handles. When you hover your mouse
over any handle or the marquee itself,
your cursor changes to a double-headed
arrow, indicating that you can drag. 
If you drag the handles outside the
image boundary, Photoshop adds a
canvas around the image when you
crop.

To move the entire marquee, position
your mouse inside the marquee until
you see a black arrowhead cursor and
then drag. Adjust the marquee until
you’re satisfied.
You can also drag the origin point
to change the axis of rotation.
If you move your mouse outside the
marquee, the cursor changes to a curved,
double-headed arrow. Dragging with this
cursor rotates the marquee. This feature
can be extremely useful when you need
to rotate and crop a crooked image. By
using the Crop tool, you can perform both
commands in one step and often more
quickly and accurately. Just be aware that
rotation, unless it’s in 90-degree incre-
ments, resamples your image, which, if
done repeatedly, can damage your image
(see the beginning of this chapter for
more on resampling). So it’s best to try to
get the rotation right the first time around.
3.
Double-click inside the cropping
marquee. 
You can also just press Enter (Return
on the Mac) or click the Commit
(check mark icon) button on the
Options bar. Photoshop discards the
area outside the marquee, as shown in
Figure 1-13. If you want to cancel the
crop, just press Esc or click Cancel (the
slashed circle icon) in the Options bar.

Cropping with the Marquee tool
If you get bored using the Crop tool, you can also crop a selected area by choosing Image➪
Crop. Simply make a selection with any of the tools and then choose this command. Although
using the Rectangular Marquee tool for your selection makes the most sense, you don’t
have to. 
You can use Image➪Crop with any selection — circular, polygonal, kidney bean, even feath-
ered. Photoshop can’t crop to those odd shapes, but it gets as close to the outline as it can,
as shown in Figure 1-14.
Using the Trim command
The fabulous Trim trims away transparent or solid-colored areas around your image. Choose
Image➪Trim, and a dialog box appears. Select Transparent Pixels (for layered images), Top
Left Pixel Color, or Bottom Right Pixel Color as a basis for the trim. Next, instruct Photoshop
Figure 1-13

Book II  Chapter 1: Specifying Size and Resolution
136
to trim away the Top, Bottom, Left, or Right side(s) from the image. This command works
great for quickly eliminating black-and-white borders around images, as shown in Figures 1-15
and 1-16.

Using the Crop and Straighten Photo Command
Because cropping is one of the most commonly used Photoshop features, this version comes
equipped with an additional cropping mechanism. 
Choose File➪Automate➪Crop and Straighten Photos. Photoshop then looks for rectangular
areas in your document, extracts each one into its own document, and then straightens those
individual images, as shown in Figure 1-16. 
The Crop and Straighten Photos command is fabulous if you want to save time by scanning
multiple images initially into one document (and the command works on single images as
well). This command is a real manual labor time saver, and I wholeheartedly endorse it.
Book
II
Chapter
1
Even though cropping is about as simple an
image-editing maneuver as you can get, you
need to know about a few other options:
 If you need a nonrectangular cropping mar-
quee, select the Perspective check box in
the Options bar. This allows the corner han-
dles to move independently. Cropping with
Perspective selected can help to rectify
images that have keystone distortion, which
occurs when you photograph an image from
an angle rather than straight on. 
 The Front Image option enables you to crop
one image so that it’s the exact same size as
another image. Open two images and crop
the first one. Click Front Image. Photoshop
enters the width, height, and resolution
values from the first image in the Options
bar. Drag the Crop tool on your second
image and adjust the marquee as desired.
Double-click inside the marquee. Photoshop
automatically crops your second image to
match your first. The Front Image command
is also available in the Options bar only
before you drag your cropping marquee.
 If your image doesn’t contain any layers —
that is, it consists only of a background — any
cropped areas are permanently deleted from
your file. However, if your image consists of
one or more layers (see Book V for the low-
down on layers), you have the choice of delet-
ing or hiding your cropped area. Delete
eliminates the cropped areas, whereas Hide
just hides the cropped area. You can see
the cropped area if you move the layer with
the Move tool. Another way to see the
hidden area is to choose Image➪Reveal All.
Photoshop expands the canvas to show all
areas in all layers. These options are available
only while the crop marquee is active.
 If you want to crop an image to an exact
measurement, enter a value in the Width,
Height, and Resolution text boxes in the
Options bar. Note that these options are avail-
able only when the Crop tool is active and you
haven’t yet dragged a cropping marquee. You
can still freely drag and adjust the cropping
marquee. When you commit the crop, your
image matches the physical dimensions you
specified. You can enter values in just one,
two, or all three options. But again, be care-
ful about the value you use for the Resolution
setting. Remember, resampling is not a good
thing. To remove the entered settings, click
the Clear button in the Options bar.

n addition to choosing a size and resolution (discussed in the
previous chapter), you need to decide on an image mode and
file format for your image. This decision is usually based on
the final use for the image. Will it be imported into a page
layout program and then offset printed? Will it be posted on a
Web page? Will it be used for a newspaper article?
When you know an image’s final destination, you can make
intelligent choices of which color mode and file format are best.
This chapter gives you some background information to help
you make those choices so that you don’t end up having to do
extra work, spend extra time, or waste extra money.
Understanding Color Theory
You can find many books, most of them detailed and lengthy,
devoted to a single subject — color — and written by bona fide
color experts who spend their days analyzing complex color
algorithms for fun. I recommend owning at least one heavy-duty
tome on color, even if its main function is to act as a paper-
weight. Even as an occasional reference, a book on color theory
is essential if you’re serious about using Photoshop in your daily
activities. In this chapter, I provide you with the minimalist’s
take on color theory.
Knowing RGB basics
When you view an RGB image, you are looking at an image com-
prised of three colors — red, green, and blue. These colors are

The colors that comprise white light from the sun

The colors your monitor uses when displaying images
Mixing these three primary colors can yield up to 16.7 million colors. In Photoshop, each of
these colors resides in a color channel in the image. Photoshop looks at a color image in terms
of its channels — individual bands of 8-bit grayscale images. When you view the channels indi-
vidually in Photoshop, you can visually see that each channel appears as a grayscale image
made up of light-, medium-, and dark-colored pixels (assuming that you have deselected the
Color Channels in the Color check box). RGB images have three bands, and CMYK images have
four bands. Each one of these bands, or grayscale images, is a channel, or more specifically a
color channel. When you view the channels together, the pixels from each channel mix to form
colors, which give you a composite, or full-color image. For the lowdown on channels, check
out Book VI, Chapter 1.
Photoshop assigns each pixel a brightness value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). These
grayscale pixels from each channel mix together to form colors, which in turn provide you
with a composite color image.
Here are some color channel examples to help you see how the RGB system works to create
so many different color variations:

A light-colored pixel from the green channel, a dark-colored pixel from the red channel,
and a dark-colored pixel from the blue channel combine to give you a green pixel.

A value of 255 from all three channels produces white.
Because RGB colors combined at 255 create white, they are known as additive colors.
When you view this white on your computer monitor, for example, it transmits all
visible wavelengths back to your eyes.

A value of 0 from all three channels produces black.

If all three values are equal, a neutral gray is produced.

A medium-dark pixel from the red channel, a black pixel from the green channel, and a
light-colored pixel from the blue channel combine to produce purple.

Mixing colors in RGB produces lighter colors. Try playing with the RGB color sliders in
your Color palette and mix your own colors to see this concept in action. Remember
that the right side of the slider (the higher numbers) represents light, and the left side
of the slider (the lower numbers) represents dark. For more on working with the color
sliders and Color palette, see Book II, Chapter 3.
Knowing CMYK basics
The CMYK color scheme is based on the light-absorbing quality of ink on paper. In theory,
a white light hits these inks. Some visible wavelengths are absorbed, or subtracted, while
others are reflected back to your eyes. CMYK images comprise various percentages of only
four colors of ink — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. These colors correspond to the inks
used in the offset printing process.
Cyan, magenta, and yellow are called subtractive colors. Technically if you combine these three
colors of ink, you produce black. But because of ink impurities, you actually end up with a
nasty brown color. (That’s why we add K, or black to produce black.)

Selecting a Color Mode in Photoshop

CMYK colors are also known as process colors. Mixing colors in CMYK produces darker
colors. Setting all four inks to 0% produces pure white.
Subtractive and additive colors are complementary. This means that each pair of subtractive
colors creates an additive color and each pair of additive colors creates a subtractive color.
Selecting a Color Mode in Photoshop
Every file has a color mode, also called an image mode or just plain mode. To determine the
color mode of an image, look in the title bar of the image window or choose Image➪Mode.
Color modes define the color values used to display the image. Photoshop offers eight differ-
ent modes and allows you to convert images from one mode to another. The color mode you
choose for a particular image depends on a couple of factors:

The file format you plan to save it in. Some modes call for specific file formats. You
may find that a certain format is unavailable because your file isn’t in the appropriate
color mode.

The end use for the image. Do you plan to post the image on the Web? Or are you put-
ting it in a brochure that will be offset printed? For more on prepping images for print,
see Book X, Chapter 2.
The next few sections provide a brief description of each mode and any file format or usage con-
nections. For examples of some modes, in full, living color, be sure to check out Color Plate 2-2.
Color modes affect the number of colors that are displayed, as well as the size of the file and
the number of channels. Each mode is also represented by one or more channels, where the
color data is stored. Grayscale images have one channel — black. CMYK images have four
channels — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. For the lowdown on channels, see Book VI,
Chapter 1.
RGB Color
Uses: RGB is the gold standard for most scanners, all monitors, and some desktop inkjet
printers. And it’s the primary color mode (with Indexed Color being secondary) to use
with any images to be viewed on-screen (whether on the Web or in any kind of multimedia
presentation).
File formats: RGB can handle just about every format except GIF.
RGB can be considered the default color mode of Photoshop. RGB images contain values of
0–255 for each of three colors — red, green, and blue. With 8 bits of color information for each
of the three colors, these 24-bit images can reproduce up to 16.7 million colors on-screen. And
48-bit images (16 bits per color) can display even more. Most scanners also scan images in
RGB, all monitors display in RGB, and some desktop inkjet printers prefer to print RGB (rather
than CMYK) images. Remember that the RGB mode in Photoshop varies according to the RGB
Working Space setting you have selected in the Color Settings dialog box. For details on Color
Settings, see Book II, Chapter 3.

CMYK Color
Uses: CMYK is the standard for images that are color separated for offset printing.
File formats: CMYK can handle just about every format except GIF.
CMYK images contain a percentage of one or more of four-process color inks — cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black. Darker colors have higher percentages, whereas lighter colors
have lower percentages. Pure white is created when all four colors have a value of 0%. Many
other composite printing devices also require images to be in CMYK mode. Again, like RGB
mode, remember that the CMYK mode in Photoshop can vary according to the CMYK Working
Space setting you have selected in the Color Settings dialog box. 
Make sure that you do all of your image editing in RGB mode, where you have access to the
full range of filters. When you complete your editing, convert the image from RGB to CMYK.
(For details, see “Converting from RGB to CMYK,” later in this chapter.)
Grayscale
Uses: Grayscale mode is for black-and-white (and all shades of gray in between) images.
File formats: All of the most commonly used file formats accept Grayscale mode.
Grayscale images contain up to 256 levels of gray. Each pixel has a brightness value ranging
from 0 (black) to 255 (white). You can scan an image in Grayscale mode, or you can convert
color images to grayscale. If you convert a color image to grayscale, Photoshop discards all
the color information, and the remaining gray levels represent the luminosity of the pixels.
(Check out the “Converting to Grayscale” section, later in this chapter.) You can also convert
a grayscale image to a color image, which, while it doesn’t convert your grayscale image to
color, it allows you to apply color on top of the grayscale image.
Monotone, Duotone, Tritone, and Quadtone
Uses: Because printing presses can print only about 50 gray levels per ink color, duotones,
which use two to four inks, are used to increase the range of tones of grayscale images.
Duotones are often created by using black and spot colors (premixed inks), although you can
also use process colors. For more on spot colors, see Book X, Chapter 2.
File formats: The only file formats that can save duotones, tritones, and quadtones are native
Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, EPS, PDF, Large Document Format, or Photoshop Raw.
These modes create one-color, (monotone), two-color (duotone), three-color (tritone), and
four-color (quadtone) images. Note that Photoshop lumps all the various “tone” modes under
duotone. You will find a pop-up menu in the Duotone options dialog box where you can select
the various options. Unlike RGB and CMYK images where the components of the image dis-
play with different colors, the monotones, duotones, tritones, and quadtones have the colors
mixed throughout the image. The colored inks are used to reproduce tinted grays, not the dif-
ferent colors you find in RGB and CMYK images.
To access the Duotone mode, you must first convert the color image to grayscale by choosing
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Then choose Image➪Mode➪Duotone. In the dialog box that
appears, choose Monotone, Duotone, Tritone, or Quadtone from the pop-up menu. Next,

Selecting a Color Mode in Photoshop
143
select ink colors — either spot or process — by clicking the swatches. Finally, you can adjust
the curves settings and tell Photoshop how to distribute the ink(s) among the various tones.
Note that you do not have access to the individual color channels in Duotone mode. The only
manipulation that you do is with the curves settings.
If you are new to these modes, you need to know that Photoshop offers numerous preset duo-
tones, tritones, and quadtones. To access these presets, click the Load button and go to the
Duotones folder (which is located in the Presets folder in the Photoshop folder).
Indexed Color
Uses: Indexed Color mode is primarily for Web graphics and multimedia displays.
File formats: Indexed Color mode supports a variety of formats, with GIF being the most pop-
ular. Others formats supported include Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, Photoshop Raw, BMP, EPS,
ElectricImage, Large Document Format, PCX, PDF, PICT, PICT Resource, PNG, Targa, and TIFF.
Indexed Color mode uses 256 colors or less; what graphics aficionados call 8-bit color. When
you convert an image to indexed color, Photoshop builds a Color Lookup Table (CLUT), which
stores and indexes the color. (Note the Color Table option in the Mode menu.) If a color in the
original image isn’t in the table, Photoshop chooses the closest match or makes a new one
from the available colors. The small amount of colors reduces the file size, which is why the
GIF file format, the preferred format for Web graphics, uses this mode. (See the “GIF” section,
later in this chapter.)
The Indexed Color mode does not support layers, and editing capabilities are limited. For
more on indexed color, see Book IX, Chapters 1 and 2.
Lab Color
Uses: Lab Color mode provides a consistent color display, which is ideal for high-end retouch-
ing of images.
File formats: You can save an image in Lab Color mode in native Photoshop, Photoshop Raw,
EPS, TIFF, PDF, JPEG 2000, Large Document Format, or Photoshop DCS 1.0 and 2.0 formats. You
can save images containing 48 bits (16 bits per channel) in Photoshop, Photoshop Raw, Large
Document Format, and TIFF formats.
Lab Color mode is usually thought of as the internal color mode Photoshop uses when con-
verting from one color mode to another — for example, when going from RGB to CMYK. It is
also the mode preferred by color-retouching experts because it is considered to be device
independent (it appears consistent on various devices).
Lab Color mode consists of a lightness channel and two additional channels, a and b, which
contain the range of color from green to red (a) and blue to yellow (b).
Bitmap
Uses: This mode is best for scanned line art and signatures (your John Hancock).
File formats: Photoshop, Photoshop 2.0, EPS, TIFF, PDF, BMP, PNG, GIF, PNG, PCX, PICT, PICT
Resource, Portable Bitmap, and Wireless Bitmap.

Bitmap images contain pixels that are either black or white, exclusively. You must convert
color images to grayscale before you can access Bitmap mode. Upon choosing Image➪
Mode➪Bitmap, a dialog box appears, offering options for resolution and method. The various
methods give different appearances, as shown in Figure 2-1, so try each one to see which you
prefer.
If you save a file in Bitmap mode as an EPS (see “EPS,” later in this chapter), you can convert
the white areas in the image to transparent areas. This allows you to overlay the file over a
background containing color or an image, and only the dark pixels show.
Figure 2-1

Converting to a Different Color Mode
145
Multichannel
Uses: Multichannel mode is for special printing needs or as an intermediate mode when con-
verting between different color modes.
File formats: The only file formats available for multichannel images are native Photoshop,
Photoshop 2.0, Photoshop DCS 2.0, Large Document Format, or Photoshop Raw formats.
The Multichannel mode comprises multiple grayscale channels, each containing 256 levels
of gray. Whenever you delete or mix channels, you end up with a multichannel image. You
can also convert any image with more than one channel to this mode. In a multichannel
image, each channel becomes a spot channel, with 256 levels of gray.
For more on channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Converting to a Different Color Mode
Sometimes, your image starts out in one color mode and then you find you need to convert
the image to another mode. Maybe you need to strip the color out of an image you’re submit-
ting to the local newspaper. Or maybe you need to convert your RGB image to CMYK to get it
ready for an offset print job.
When you convert modes, you are permanently changing the color values in your image, so
save a backup image just in case.
The next few sections offer pointers for the most common conversions you’ll make.
Converting from RGB to CMYK
As I mention several times in this book, CMYK is the image mode necessary for high-end
composite printing and offset printing. You will first want to perform all your necessary 
image-editing tasks in RGB mode for the following reasons:

The image size is smaller because RGB mode has only three channels.

The RGB color space provides more device independence because it isn’t reliant on inks.

You have full accessibility to filters.

RGB mode provides a large color gamut, so Photoshop preserves more colors after it
makes image adjustments.
When you’re finished editing the image in RGB mode, you can convert the image from RGB to
CMYK (you can perform any fine-tuning in CMYK mode if necessary). If you’re new to this pro-
cedure, you may be surprised at what can result. Because the color gamut (range of colors) of
the RGB model (16.7 million) is much larger than that of CMYK (approximately 55,000), you
may see a color shift, which may range from slight to major.
The extent of the shift depends on the colors in the RGB image and how many of them are out
of gamut. Photoshop replaces RGB colors that are out of gamut with the closest match avail-
able within the CMYK gamut, often replacing the electric blues, fiery reds, and sunny yellows
with duller, muddier CMYK equivalents. Unfortunately, you can’t do anything to prevent this.

It is just the way of the world of color. However, if you can select colors (rather than acquiring
them from a scan), be sure that you don’t select any colors that are out of gamut to begin
with. Check out Book II, Chapter 3, for all you need to know about working with and managing
color in Photoshop.
If you want to see what the effects of your CMYK conversion will be without actually converting,
choose View➪Proof Setup➪Working CMYK. This view is referred to as a soft proof — previewing
on-screen how your image will look on various output devices or various modes. For more on soft
proofs, see Book II, Chapter 3.
Converting to Grayscale
You can convert a color image to grayscale a multitude of ways. The next few sections cover a
few that you may want to try out.
You can also use the Channel Mixer to create custom grayscale images. For more on the
Channel Mixer, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Quick and dirty method
Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Photoshop then asks you whether you want to discard
color information. Click OK. Photoshop merges the RGB or CMYK channels into one black
channel, and you now have a grayscale image. You may find that although this method does
the job in stripping color from your image, you may be left with an image that is flat and lack-
ing contrast. You can apply a Levels adjustment (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels) to
boost the contrast, or you can try one of the other conversion methods. If your image con-
tains multiple layers, Photoshop asks whether you want to merge your layers. If you want to
keep your layers, click the Don’t Merge button.
Be aware that you can no longer apply color to your image. If you choose a color in the Color
palette, the color appears gray in the foreground and background color icons. If you want to
apply color to your grayscale image, you must convert it back to RGB or CMYK mode.
Lab Color mode method
Choose Image➪Mode➪Lab Color. As mentioned earlier, converting to Lab Color mode con-
verts the channels into a lightness channel and a and b channels containing ranges of color.
Delete the a channel. The b channel then changes its name to Alpha 2. Delete the Alpha 2
channel. That leaves you with the lightness channel, which is now named Alpha 1. Choose
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Your color image is now a grayscale one. Note that if your image
contains multiple layers, Photoshop flattens the layers when you convert to grayscale. Make
sure that you finish all your edits requiring layers before you convert to grayscale. This
method most likely provides a better grayscale image than the quick and dirty method.
Best channel method
If you look at the individual channels in the image, one often stands out as being a very good
grayscale image by itself. (If channels are a mystery to you, check out Book VI, Chapter 1, for
details.) You may find that the red channel provides a good grayscale image when the subject
is people, because humans have a lot of red in their skin. Or you may find the green channel

Using the Conditional Mode Change Command
147
looks good in a scenic shot. The blue channel rarely yields a nice image, though. Most of the
crud picked up from scanners finds its way into the blue channel.
In the Channels palette, select each channel and view its contents. Find the channel that looks
the best and then choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. Photoshop asks you if you want to dis-
card all the other channels. Click OK. Like with the Lab Color method, if your image contains
multiple layers, Photoshop flattens the layers when you convert to grayscale.
Converting to Indexed Color
You may need to convert your RGB or CMYK images to Indexed Color to save them as GIFs
and prepare them for posting on the Web. The main issue to be aware of is that the Indexed
Color mode contains only 256 colors (or even less). That is a far cry from the thousands or
millions offered by CMYK and RGB images. If color is critical, you may want to reconsider
making the conversion and instead leave or convert your image to RGB mode.
The Indexed Color mode cannot support layers, so again, be sure to perform all necessary
editing functions before making the conversion. You also lose all capabilities to anti-alias any
portion of your image, including your text, which can lead to hard, jagged edges that you may
not want. The bottom line is, perform all of your editing functions in another mode and con-
vert to Indexed Color only when you’re ready to save the image for the Web. When converting
to indexed color, you have options for specific palettes, numbers of colors, dithering, and so
on, as shown in Figure 2-2. These options affect the appearance of the image. For more on the
Indexed Color mode and these options, see Book IX, Chapters 1 and 2.

Using the Conditional Mode Change Command
Photoshop enables you to specify instances where one mode changes into another so that
you can utilize the conversion command in an action. Briefly, an action is a collection of
recorded and saved commands that you can replay again and again. For details on actions,
Figure 2-2

II
Chapter
2

▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼

Book II  Chapter 2: Choosing Color Modes and File Formats
148
see Book II, Chapter 6. Sometimes when you incorporate a mode conversion as part of an
action, you get an error message because the file you’re opening may not have the same mode
you specified as the source mode in the action. For example, you may have specified CMYK as
your source mode in the action. But if the action opens a file in Grayscale mode, you get an
error message, because the Grayscale mode of the file doesn’t match the CMYK source mode.
The Conditional Mode Change command takes care of this problem. Here’s what you do to
add this command to your action:
1.
Start creating and recording your
action. 
2.
Choose File➪Automate➪Conditional
Mode Change. 
c In the Conditional Mode Change
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-3, select
the mode(s) you want as valid for the
source mode. Other options include
the All or None buttons to select all
modes or no modes. 
d Select your desired target mode from
the Mode pop-up menu. 
5.
Click OK. 
If all goes well, Photoshop incorporates
the Conditional Mode Change com-
mand as a step in your action.
Choosing the Right File Format
A critical component in saving a file is choosing the file format. The file format is the way the
file’s data is represented and saved. Photoshop generously offers numerous file formats to
choose from. Some you’ll use frequently, and others you’ll never set eyes on.
I provide quite a bit of detail on the formats you’ll use most frequently, and throw in a brief
description of those you’ll encounter only once in a blue moon (if at all). 
Note that if a file format doesn’t appear in the Open, Save, or another dialog box, you may
need to install the plug-in for that particular format.
Be sure to check out the handy table in Book X, Chapter 2. It offers a list of what file formats
work for various applications and uses.
TIFF
TIFF, Tagged Image File Format, is by far one of the best and most useful formats. One of the
great qualities of TIFFs is that they are and have always been totally cross-platform. In addition,
3
4
Figure 2-3

Choosing the Right File Format
149
almost every program on the planet can import TIFFs. Okay, so that’s a slight exaggeration.
Almost every word processing, presentation, page layout, drawing, painting, and image-editing
program can import TIFFs. This file format works especially well for images that will be printed
or color separated.
Photoshop allows you to save layers and transparency and also use various methods of com-
pression. You have the option of having Photoshop warn you that including layers increases
your file size. To enable this option, select the Ask Before Saving Layered TIFF Files check box
in the Preferences dialog box. Photoshop saves the layers along with a flattened version of the
image. Be aware that some applications may display only the flattened version.
It should come as no surprise that the most commonly used format offers a variety of options —
all of which are available in the TIFF Options dialog box (shown in Figure 2-4). The following
sections give you everything you need to know about your various options so that you can
make an informed decision based on your intended uses for the image.
Image Compression
Photoshop offers three methods of compression, besides the option of None, which of course
leaves your image uncompressed:

LZW: This method has been around for eons and is a lossless compression scheme. This
means that data is not deleted to make your file smaller. LZW does an especially good
job when you use it to compress images with large areas of a single color. Most pro-
grams that support TIFF also support LZW compression, so you can use this method
without much hesitation.
If your files are unusually large, compressing them will make your files save and open more
slowly. Note that TIFFs can be up to 4GB in file size. Be careful, however, because older ver-
sions of Photoshop and other applications don’t support file sizes larger than 2GB.
Figure 2-4
Book
II
Chapter
2

Book II  Chapter 2: Choosing Color Modes and File Formats
150

Zip: Zip compression is also a lossless method and is popular in the Windows arena.
Like LZW, it works well with images that have large areas of a single color.

JPEG: This method, while popular and very effective, is a lossy compression process.
When compressing, JPEG deletes data in order to reduce the file size. (That’s where the
loss in lossy comes from.) When you open the file again, that deleted data is remanufac-
tured by the program. Over time, this repetitive deleting and remanufacturing can
degrade image quality. I recommend that you stick with LZW compression.
Lossy compression can eat away at the quality of your image. Photoshop recompresses a
JPEG image every time you save it in JPEG format. During a single edit session, this com-
pression won’t hurt because JPEG works from the on-screen version. But if you close,
reopen, and resave the image in JPEG format, degradation occurs. You may not see the
results right away, but you will over time. Leave your image in either TIFF or native
Photoshop file formats while editing. Then when you’re completely done editing and you
need to compress the image, save the file as a JPEG at a high to maximum quality setting.
Byte Order
Specify whether you want to save the TIFF for a Mac or a PC. If you want to be able to use the
image on both platforms, select IBM PC. Macs are much more forgiving when exchanging files.
Save Image Pyramid
This option allows you to save multiple resolutions of an image. The top of the pyramid is the
lowest resolution, and the bottom of the pyramid is the highest resolution. If the program
supports them, you can choose to open any of the resolutions.
Currently, only Adobe InDesign supports image pyramids. Photoshop can open only the image
at the highest resolution within the file. I recommend leaving this option deselected.
Save Transparency
Select this option to preserve transparent areas when the TIFF is opened in other applica-
tions. Of course, those applications must also support transparency. If you open a TIFF with
transparency in Photoshop, the transparent areas are always preserved whether or not you
select the option.
Layer Compression
If you want to save the layers in your file, Photoshop saves a flattened version along with
your layered version to ensure compatibility with programs that don’t recognize layers. If
you retain the layers, you have the choice of RLE (Run Length Encoding) or Zip compression.
Because RLE compression is also lossless, you have the choice of faster saves (RLE) or
smaller files (Zip). The last choice is for Photoshop to discard the layers, thereby flattening
the image and then saving it as a copy. Your original layered file also remains intact.

Choosing the Right File Format
151
JPEG
JPEG, the acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, is a file format that uses lossy
compression (explained in the “Image Compression” section). The JPEG file format offers
13 compression settings — the higher the quality, the less the compression, and vice versa.
JPEG compression is very effective. It can squeeze your file size to practically nothing. JPEG
compression works best with continuous-tone images, such as photographs. But because the
compression is lossy, I don’t recommend this format for high-end printing and color separations.
JPEG supports RGB, CMYK, and Grayscale image modes. It doesn’t support alpha channels.
If you want to post your image on the Web, you have to save it as a JPEG, GIF, or PNG.
JPEG works great with photographic images that have a wide range of colors. Check out
Book IX, Chapters 1 and 2, for the lowdown on all the JPEG options and settings.
JPEG 2000
JPEG 2000 is a new member to Photoshop repertoire of supported file formats. A cousin to
standard JPEG, it provides a few more bells and whistles, including better compression rates
and more quality settings. In addition to the standard lossy compression algorithms, JPEG 2000
also offers lossless compression, shown in Figure 2-5, and can support 16-bit images, alpha and
spot channels, and transparency (8 bit-images only). You can save this format using the fol-
lowing image modes: RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and Lab Color. If you want to be able to utilize
this file format, be sure to install this optional plug-in found on the Photoshop CS Install CD.

One of the coolest features of this format is it supports the use of a Region of Interest (ROI).
This feature allows you to selectively choose a region of an image that you can then optimize
to ensure the best quality. You save an alpha channel to define that vital portion of the image
where detail retention is critical. You can then compress the rest of the image more heavily
and with lesser quality, resulting in a smaller file size. For more details on JPEG 2000, see Book
IX, Chapters 1 and 2.
Although praising the qualities of JPEG 2000 is all well and good, be warned that you cur-
rently (at press time of this book) need a plug-in to be able to view these files on the Web. In
the future, this format is sure to become a standard on the Web and with digital cameras.
GIF
GIF is another file format used for Web graphics. While GIFs support transparency, on the
down side you must save GIFs in the Indexed Color mode, which comprises 256 colors or less.
Although this is great for making tiny files, it’s not so great for continuous-tone images where
the number of colors displayed is critical. Therefore, the GIF format is usually reserved for
illustrations (spot illustrations, buttons, logos, and so on) and type with large areas of flat
colors and sharp details. For the whole story on GIFs, see Book IX, Chapters 1 and 2.
EPS
EPS is short for Encapsulated PostScript. PostScript is a page-description language developed
by Adobe and used by many printers. The EPS format can contain both vector and raster
graphics. (For details on vector and raster graphics, see Book II, Chapter 1.) EPSs tend to
create larger file sizes and do not have a built-in compression scheme like JPEGs or TIFFs. EPS
is the recommended file format for creating color separations for high-end, four-color print
jobs. This is also the file format to use for images with clipping paths and those with a
Duotone color mode. In addition to duotones, EPS supports Lab Color, CMYK, RGB, Indexed
Color, Grayscale, DCS, and Bitmap modes. It does not support alpha channels. Finally, EPS is
the format of choice for importing to and from drawing programs such as Illustrator,
FreeHand, and CorelDraw.
Here are the options when saving in the EPS format, as shown in Figure 2-6:
Figure 2-6

Choosing the Right File Format
153

Preview: If you import your EPS into another application, this option provides a low-
resolution image for you to view. I recommend choosing 8-bit TIFF, which works on both
PC and Mac.

Encoding: This option specifies the way an image is sent to the PostScript printer.
Choose Binary if you can; it produces smaller files and keeps all original data. If you’re
having printing problems, choose ASCII. JPEG compresses the file, but discards data
and may cause color-separation problems. Avoid it if possible.

Include Halftone Screen and Include Transfer Function: Use these options for offset
print jobs. Leave these options to the service-bureau or commercial-printing experts.

Transparent Whites: If your image is in Bitmap color mode, this option allows white
areas to appear transparent.

PostScript Color Management: This option converts the file’s color data to the printer’s
color space. I do not recommend selecting this option if you are importing your image
into a document that is color managed. For more on color management, see Book II,
Chapter 3.

Include Vector Data: When selected, this option preserves any vector graphics, such as
type and shapes. However, it is preserved only when you import the file into another
program. If you reopen the EPS in Photoshop, however, your vector data is rasterized.

Image Interpolation: This option anti-aliases (softens the edges) of low-resolution
images when printed.
PDF: The Universal Donor
PDF is the acronym for Portable Document Format, which is the native format of Adobe
Acrobat. This format, developed by Adobe, can contain editable text, vector, and raster data.
PDF files are often used for electronic documentation that will be downloaded from the Web.
You’ve probably noticed that every Adobe Help document is in PDF format, and if you’re a
Web user, you’ve probably downloaded more than a few PDFs. Even the government, notori-
ously slow to catch on to new technology, has embraced PDF. The military uses PDFs for tech-
nical documentation. And all your tax forms are available as downloadable PDFs.
You might be thinking, “So what. I’m into images, not documents.” Well, hold on a second.
PDFs can be extremely useful in the imaging world as well. Anyone with a computer running
Windows, Mac OS, or Unix can read a PDF. All you need to view a PDF file is Adobe Acrobat
Reader, which is available as a free download from the Adobe Web site. If you save your image
as a PDF and e-mail it (or post it on the Web as a downloadable file) to a colleague, manager,
client, or friend, that person can see your image — colors, fonts, and all — exactly like you see
it. The other nice thing about PDFs is that they have an automatic compression process that
makes the files small and manageable for mail transfer or loading on the Web.
When you save a file as a Photoshop PDF, you have all the same save options of the native
Photoshop format. PDF supports layers and annotations, so select these options if you have
either one. It also supports the same image modes as the native Photoshop format. In addi-
tion, you can now save 16-bit images as PDF. Here is a description of the other options found
in the PDF Options dialog box, shown in Figure 2-7:

Encoding: Choose Zip compression if optimum print quality is an issue. Otherwise,
select JPEG at the maximum setting.

Save Transparency: When selected, this option preserves any transparent areas in your
file. This option is grayed out if your file doesn’t contain transparency or has a spot
color channel.

Image Interpolation: This option anti-aliases, or slightly softens the edges, of low-
resolution images when they are printed. Keep this option selected.

Downgrade Color Profile: If you selected ICC Profile (Windows) or Embed Color Profile
(Mac) in the Save dialog box in Photoshop Version 4, selecting this option downgrades
the profile to Version 2. Select this option if you need to open the file in a program that
doesn’t support Photoshop Version 4 profiles.

PDF Security: Click the Security Settings button to access the PDF Security dialog box,
also shown in Figure 2-7. You can assign a password for opening the file in Acrobat
Reader. You can also assign a master password that is required to open the file in
Photoshop, which then allows for full access, enabling you to make changes to the
image and to the passwords themselves. On the Compatibility pop-up menu, choose
the type of encryption — 40-bit RC4, a low encryption level, is fine if you just want to
prevent opening the file. Choose a higher level 128-bit RC4 encryption if you want more

specific options regarding accessibility (for disabled persons), level of content changes
allowed, and allowable printing resolutions. Finally, choose whether you want your user
to be able to print or change the document, copy it or extract content, or add or change
comments and form fields. 
Note that Acrobat 3 and Acrobat 4 users cannot open PDFs with 128-bit RC4 (Acrobat 5)
encryption. And similarly, Acrobat 3, Acrobat 4, and Acrobat 5 users cannot open PDFs with
128-bit RC4 (Acrobat 6) encryption.

Include Vector Data: Select this option to preserve vector paths. If you have text in
your file, select the Embed Fonts option, which ensures that your fonts display cor-
rectly on any computer, even if those fonts aren’t installed. But be sure not to use any
faux styles or warped text. Embedding fonts increases file size, but it is well worth it. If
you select the Use Outlines for Text option, Photoshop converts all your text to paths.
This can be helpful if your fonts aren’t displaying or printing properly, but you won’t be
able to select the text or use the Search command in Acrobat. Your text does remain
editable in Photoshop, however.
You can now save multiple images into a single, multi-paged PDF document or slide show. This
is a great way to e-mail images to coworkers, family, and friends. Choose File➪Automate➪
PDF Presentation. For more details, see Book X, Chapter 3.
Photoshop
Of course, I can’t forget the native Photoshop format (.psd). This format offers a lot of bene-
fits. First of all, along with TIFF and PDF, Photoshop allows you to save layers in your image.
The other formats flatten the layers into a single background. This format works well if you
are going to spend a considerable length of time working on your image. The Photoshop
format also supports all image modes, is the fastest format for opening and saving, and offers
all the various save options.
Like TIFF, the Photoshop format uses a lossless compression process, although it’s invisible to
you. If you need to open a file in an older version of Photoshop, be sure to save it as a native
Photoshop file. Finally, almost all drawing and layout programs now support the importing of
Photoshop files.
Photoshop Raw
This format is designed to transfer images among applications and platforms. The Photoshop
Raw format can be useful if you want to transfer an image to or from a mainframe computer or
other type of device that doesn’t support the standard graphic formats. Don’t confuse it with
the Camera Raw format described later in this chapter. The Photoshop Raw format supports
CMYK, RGB, and Grayscale images with alpha channels. It also supports Multichannel and
Lab Color images without alpha channels. The format allows for any pixel or file size, but it
doesn’t support layers. 
You may never have to save a file in the Photoshop Raw format. And you may not want to
after you read the options involved in saving in this format. The Photoshop Raw format
imports and exports files in an uncompressed, binary format. The format does not specify
image size, color mode, or bit depth. It is simply comprised of bytes that represent the color
information in the image. Each pixel is represented by a brightness value, with 0 being black

Book II  Chapter 2: Choosing Color Modes and File Formats
156
and 255 being white. The format then includes the total number of color channels in the
image, plus any other channels, such as alpha channels. In order to save a file in the
Photoshop Raw format you must specify certain settings found in the Photoshop Raw Options
dialog box:

File Type (Mac OS only): This four-character ID identifies the file type. PRAW is the
default ID for the Photoshop Raw format. Leave this default setting. 

File Creator (Mac OS only): Another four-character ID which tells the operating system
which application created the file. Leave the default setting of 8BIM (Photoshop’s code),
unless you know the special file creator ID for the application you plan on using the file
with. Many Mac applications have file creator IDs registered with the Apple Computer
Developer Services group.

Header: This parameter specifies how many bytes of information appear in the file
before the image data starts. The default setting of 0 means there is no header. If, for
example, you enter a 2, two zeros are entered at the beginning of the file as placehold-
ers. When you open the Photoshop Raw format, you can then replace those placehold-
ers with a header. I recommend leaving the value at 0.

Save Channels In: Choose between Interleaved Order and Non-Interleaved Order. The
default setting of Interleaved Order stores the color data sequentially by pixels. In other
words, in an RGB image, the first byte is red for the first pixel, the second byte is green
for the second pixel, the third byte is blue for the third pixel. Non-Interleaved Order
stores the color data by channel. In this case, the first byte is red for the first pixel, the
second byte is also red for the second pixel. Once the red channel is complete, it then
goes and saves the green and then the blue channel.
Your choice depends on requirements of the application that will open the file. 
Camera Raw
The Camera Raw file format is the format used by many digital cameras to capture and save
image data and also the image’s metadata. In fact, this format captures everything there is to
get about an image. Each camera has its own proprietary raw image format. Fortunately,
Photoshop can support most camera models, especially higher-end cameras. In this new ver-
sion of Photoshop, the Camera Raw plug-in has been directly incorporated into the applica-
tion, which enables you to work more efficiently with camera data. It also enables you to
quickly select and apply your Camera Raw settings by batch processing images using the
File Browser. Within the plug-in, you will find controls to make adjustments in white balance,
exposure, shadows, contrast, saturation, sharpness, and so on. If, by chance, the Camera Raw
plug-in doesn’t support your particular camera model, contact Adobe to see if they will be
supporting it in the near future.
Camera Raw files utilize a lossless scheme to capture and save image data, similar to TIFFs.
This is advantageous, because no data is lost through compression as it is with the JPEG
format. Camera Raw files also have the advantage of being smaller than uncompressed
TIFFs. Of all the digital camera file formats, only Camera Raw images contain the actual,
unadulterated data captured by the digital camera’s sensor (a Charged Coupled Device [CCD]
or Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor [CMOS]) without any camera adjustments,
filters, and other processing. Many hard-core photographers consider this file format to be

Choosing the Right File Format
157
the pure digital “negative,” so to speak. They prefer to analyze, manipulate, and adjust the
image data themselves rather than leaving those decisions to the mercy of the camera. This
file format also prevents the loss of any image data that can sometimes occur when a file is
converted from its native format to a more commonly used format like TIFF or PSD.
Your camera may not capture images in the Camera Raw format. It may just allow you
to save your images as either JPEG or TIFF. Don’t worry. You’ll be fine with these formats.
However, if your camera is capable of saving images in Camera Raw format, you want to
check out the capabilities of this plug-in. Because going into detail on each setting found in
the plug-ins dialog box is beyond the scope of this book, be sure and visit www.adobe.com/
products/photoshop/cameraraw.html. Here you will find a downloadable User Guide,
a Q&A file, and great tutorials showing you all you need to know about working with the
Camera Raw plug-in.
PICT
PICT, for Macintosh Picture, is a format developed by Apple as its main format for Mac graph-
ics. It is based on the QuickDraw screen language. And although many Mac programs support
PICT, I don’t recommend using it for any images that you plan to print. PICTs are notorious for
being absurdly slow in the printing department. Today, PICT images are usually used for
graphics to be incorporated into slides, screen presentations (such as PowerPoint), multi-
media projects, and digital video. PICT supports RGB (with a single alpha channel), Indexed
Color, Grayscale, and Bitmap (without alpha channels) image modes.
Make sure that QuickTime is running if you want to save a file as a PICT. Here are the options
that appear in the PICT File Options dialog box, shown in Figure 2-8:

Resolution: Options for grayscale images are 2, 4, and 8 bits per pixel. Options for color
images are 16 and 32 bits per pixel. Under no circumstances should you change the
default option. If you do, you delete colors from your image, and you cannot access the
compression settings.

Compression: The compression settings for PICT are more limited than those for the
regular JPEG format. Be aware that the compression scheme used for PICTs causes even
more degradation to your image than with JPEGs. To minimize the damage, always
select the maximum quality setting.

BMP
BMP is a standard Windows file format commonly used for saving images that you want to
make part of your computer’s resources, such as the wallpaper that you see on your Windows
desktop. BMP is also a format used by computer programmers. BMP supports RGB, Indexed
Color, Grayscale, and Bitmap image modes.
Here are your options when saving a BMP file:

File Format: Choose between Windows and OS/2.

Depth: Although you can select a bit depth, I recommend leaving the default setting
Photoshop has selected for you.

Compress (RLE): The compression scheme used is lossless, which is great, but don’t
select this option if you are creating wallpaper. Windows won’t recognize it.

Flip Row Order: This option enables Windows to recognize the file by reading the first
row of pixels first and the last row last. It is for programmers who are coding for
Windows applications. Leave it deselected unless you’re one of them.
Don’t worry about the Advanced Modes option. It is even more eggheady than the other
options and strictly programming territory.
Large Document Format (PSB)
Work with humongous files? Then you’ll be pleased to know that the Large Document
Format supports files of any size. Besides the Photoshop Raw and TIFF file formats, the Large
Document Format is the only other format that can save files over 2GB. What’s even better
is that the coveted features, such as layers, layer effects, and filters, are all supported by this
format. If you want to work with large files, just make sure you have the Enable Large
Document Format option selected in the File Saving panel of your Preferences.
You knew it was too good to be true, right? Just remember that Large Document Format
files can be opened in Photoshop CS only. So make sure any recipients of your files have the
latest and greatest version of Photoshop. This limitation isn’t confined to older versions of
Photoshop either. Be forewarned that many other applications fall to their knees when pre-
sented with a file size larger than 2GB.
The others
The formats I describe in previous sections are ones you’ll use 99 percent of the time, but
here’s a brief description of some of the others, just in case you’re curious:

Photoshop DCS 1.0 and 2.0: A version of EPS, this format divides your CMYK or
Multichannel image into Desktop Color Separations (DCS). DCS 2.0 supports spot and
alpha channels. It requires a PostScript printer to print.

EPS Pict Preview/EPS TIFF Preview: These EPS formats are created in applications,
such as Quark Xpress, which create previews but aren’t directly supported by
Photoshop. However, you can open and edit these files.

Choosing the Right File Format
159

PICT Resource: This format, Macintosh Picture Resource, is used for Mac start-up
screens. You can use images that are in RGB (with a single alpha channel), Indexed
Color, Grayscale, or Bitmap (without alpha channels) modes.

PCX: This is the native format for PC Paintbrush. This format supports RGB, Indexed
Color, Grayscale, and Bitmap color modes. It doesn’t support alpha channels. Images
can have a bit depth of 1, 4, 8, or 24, and RLE compression is supported.

Acrobat TouchUp Image: Editing an image in Adobe Acrobat with the TouchUp tool
allows the file to be opened in Photoshop. That image is then saved in this file format,
which uses a .pdf extension. You can also open Adobe TouchUp Images in Photoshop.
Mac OS X screenshots are also saved in this format by default. 

PhotoCD: This Kodak file format allows a single file to contain five different resolutions
that you can open.

PixelPaint: This format is an early file format native to Apple’s first color paint program.

PNG: A newer format for Web graphics, PNG (Portable Network Graphics) offers good
lossless compression, transparency, and 24-bit color. PNG supports RGB, Indexed Color,
Grayscale, and Bitmap image modes. See Book IX, Chapters 1 and 2.

Pixar: This is the format used for Pixar workstations, which are high-end, 3-D-modeling
computers. You can use RGB or grayscale images with a single alpha channel.

Filmstrip: This format is used for animation and digital video. For more information, see
Book X, Chapter 1.

IFF Format: The IFF (Interchange File Format) is a general storage format that can store
different types of data, such as image, sound, music, video, and textual information. The
popular modeling program Maya uses the IFF format.

MacPaint: This oldie but goodie is the native file format for Apple’s early black-and-
white paint program.

Generic PDF: Generic PDFs are created in programs such as Adobe Acrobat and
Illustrator and can contain multiple pages or images. When you open a Generic PDF
with multiple pages, you can specify which page you wish to open. If you open a
Generic PDF with vector graphics, Photoshop rasterizes the image.

Generic EPS: When you open a vector graphic, Photoshop rasterizes the graphic as a
Generic EPS. Generic EPS can also be created in other non-Adobe imaging, drawing, and
layout programs.

QuickTime Movie (ImageReady): This cross-platform format is used mainly for digital
video. ImageReady enables you to open and save animations as .mov files. Note that
Windows users must have QuickTime installed in order to have this format listed on
their File of Type pop-up menu.

Macromedia Flash (SWF) (ImageReady): The Flash file format is used for saving stream-
ing animations, which are commonly integrated in Web sites. This format allows you to
embed other file formats such as JPEG. 

WBMP: This format, Wireless Bitmap, is used for images that will appear on mobile
devices such as cell phones and PDAs. WBMP supports only 1-bit color (black or white).

Portable Bitmap (PBM): This 1-bit, monochrome file format is mainly for Unix platforms
as an intermediate file format used in graphic conversions.

Scitex CT: This format, Scitex Continuous Tone, is designed for Scitex prepress software
and hardware.

SGI RGB: The high-end Silicon Graphics computer platform uses this format for RGB and
Grayscale images. Files can be recognized by their .sgi, .rgb, or .bw file extensions.

Targa: Developed by TrueVision for its video boards, Targa is used to capture still
frames from video on PCs. This format supports RGB, Indexed Color, and Grayscale
images, the latter two without alpha channels.

Raw: This format is used to exchange files between PCs and Macs and mainframe com-
puters. It is often used to save images created by scientific applications. Be aware that
this format sacrifices colors and other image data.

Alias PIX, Wavefront RLA, Electric Image, and Soft Image: These are extremely high-
end formats used for 3-D, animation, and special-effect graphics.

Cineon: Kodak developed this high-end file format. Cineon files have 10 bits per channel
and are used in the film industry for electronic compositing and enhancement.

Photoshop 2.0: Use this format if you know someone living in an ice cave in Siberia who
is still using Photoshop 2. This format is Mac only.

C
olor in Photoshop takes on two personalities. On one
hand, choosing colors and applying them is easy, fun, and
stress free. On the other hand, managing color — that is,
making what you see on-screen match what comes out on
paper (or in your browser) — can be difficult, frustrating, and
chock-full of stress.
Unfortunately, you have to be well versed in both picking great
colors and managing colors for print. (What’s the use of creat-
ing the next Mona Lisa in Photoshop only to find it looks like a
fifth-generation color Xerox copy?) In this chapter, I start out
by showing you how to define and apply color; then I ease you
into the world of color management.
If you haven’t already read the section on color theory in Book
II, Chapter 2, you might want to give it a gander before you dive
into this chapter. Knowing a little color theory may make this
chapter a little more, er, palette-able.
Dealing with Foreground and
Background Colors
Photoshop has two categories of color — a foreground color and a
background color. You apply the foreground color when you use
the type tools, the painting tools, or the shape tools. It is also the
beginning color of a default gradient applied by the Gradient tool.
The background color is the color you apply with the Eraser tool
(assuming you don’t have layers) and is the ending color of the
default gradient. When you increase the size of your canvas, you
fill the additional canvas with the background color (also assum-
ing you don’t have layers). You find the swatches that represent
the two color categories in the lower part of the Tools palette
(also known as the Toolbox), as shown in Figure 3-1.

The default color for the foreground is black; the background is white. Click the small icon
labeled in Figure 3-1 to return the colors to the defaults or simply press the D key. That’s
easy to remember. To switch the foreground and background colors, click the curved arrow
in the Toolbox or press the X key.
Here are a few tips about using tools with foreground and background colors:

Use the Brush tool or the Pencil tool with the foreground color. These tools always
apply the foreground color.

Blend the foreground and background with the Gradient tool. When you drag with
the Gradient tool across the canvas and the gradient is set to the default, you get a
blending of the foreground and background colors.

Fill selected areas with the foreground color. Just click your canvas with the Paint
Bucket tool to select areas based on a Tolerance setting and fill those areas with the
foreground color.

Apply the background color by erasing. If you are working on a background rather
than a layer, you can use the Eraser tool to apply the background color. Some people
prefer to say you are erasing to the background or canvas color.
If you use the Eraser tool on a layer, you erase to transparency. See Book V for the
scoop on layers.

Use the Shape tools to create shapes that are filled with the foreground color. Simply
create the shape, and voilà.

Add more background to your canvas and fill it with the background color. When
you enlarge your canvas size, Photoshop automatically fills the added canvas with the
background color.
If you enlarge a layer, the extra canvas is transparent. See Book II, Chapter 1, if the word
canvas seems foreign to you.

Poking around the Color Picker
When you click either the Foreground or Background color swatch in the Toolbox (also called
the Tools palette), you’re transported magically to the Color Picker. This huge dialog box,
shown in Figure 3-2, allows you to select a color from the color spectrum (called a color
slider) or to define your color numerically.
Choosing a color visually is fine for Web or multimedia work, but not recommended for
print work, of course. Among other reasons, your monitor uses an RGB (red, green, blue)
color model, whereas printers use a CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) model. For
more on this and other color management issues, see “Color Management Essentials,” later
in this chapter. For the basics of color theory, see Book II, Chapter 2.
To choose a color visually with the Color Picker, follow these steps:

Mixing with the Color palette
To open the Color palette, shown in Figure 3-3, choose Window➪Color. A couple of swatches in
this palette may look vaguely familiar. That’s because they represent the foreground and back-
ground colors, just like the swatches in the Toolbox. And just like the Toolbox swatches, if you
click the swatches in the Color palette, the infamous Color Picker appears. But forget the Color
Picker; you don’t need to go there. Everything you need is right here in this tiny palette.
Before you use the Color Picker to define your colors, you should know which color model
you want to use. Here is a short description of each:

RGB (Red-Green-Blue) is the color model used for anything that will be viewed on-
screen — from multimedia and slide presentations to content for the Web. Occasionally,
you can use it if you plan to print using desktop inkjet printers.

CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black) is the color model used in printing.

Web Color is the model used strictly for the Web. If you choose this model, make sure
that you also choose Make Ramp Web Safe from the Color palette options menu.

HSB (Hue-Saturation-Brightness), which I don’t cover in Book II, Chapter 2, is based
on percentages of saturation and brightness and an angle (0 to 360 degrees), which
corresponds to a location on the color wheel.

Lab (Lightness, a, b) color model contains three channels, one for lightness; one (a),
which contains colors from green to red; and one (b), which contains colors from blue
to red. Lab is more complex to understand and work with than the other models and is
the color model of choice for high-end color experts. By the way, Lab is also
Photoshop’s “native” color mode.


Grayscale is the color model if you want to work strictly in black and white and shades
of gray. You’ll get one slider, K, which represents black. Move the slider to get shades of
gray, including complete white and black.
Here are the quick and easy steps to define a color by using the Color palette:
Book
II
Chapter
3
a Choose either the Foreground or
Background color swatch in the
Color palette.
You can change only one swatch at a time.
If the one you want is already selected, do
nothing. A double outline appears around
the swatch indicating that it’s selected.
If you accidentally click the swatch
that is already selected, the Color
Picker dialog box appears. Just click
Cancel and start over.
b Select your desired color model from
the Color palette pop-up menu.
Your options are RGB Sliders, CMYK
Sliders, Lab Sliders, Web Color Sliders,
HSB Sliders, and Grayscale Slider.
You’ll probably be using RGB, CMYK,
or Web Color the majority of the time.
If you’re not sure what these color
models represent, check out the previ-
ous list and review Book II, Chapter 2.
(See Figure 3-3.)
c In the Color palette, move the sliders
for each component of the color
model or enter a numeric value.
RGB values are based on brightness
levels, from 0 to 255, with 0 being black
and 255 being the pure color or white.
CMYK values are based on percentages
(1–100) of the four process colors — Cyan,
Magenta, Yellow, and Black. The Web
Color model gives you only the 216 colors
used by Web browsers.
You can also select a color by clicking
inside the color ramp at the bottom of
the Color palette. And to quickly return
to the default colors, click the small
black and white swatches at the end of
the color ramp.
d Keep an eye open for a triangular
alert icon, shown in Figure 3-3.
This icon is known as the gamut alarm.
Its appearance is Photoshop’s way of
saying, “Hey, you! That color you mixed
won’t print like you think it will because
it’s out of gamut.” Remember gamut is
the range of colors a device can either
display or print.
Because the RGB color model has a
much wider gamut than the CMYK
color model, some of the colors can
only be viewed on-screen and not
reproduced on paper.
Photoshop offers you a substitution.
Inside a little square to the right of the
gamut alarm icon, the closest printable
color to the one you chose appears.
5.
Click either the icon or the square if
you want to use the closest printable
color rather than your original choice.
The gamut alarm isn’t applicable if you
choose Web Color Sliders. You have
another kind of alarm described next.
If you want to use the RGB color model
but also want to ensure that any color you
choose is printable, select CMYK Spectrum
from the Color palette options menu. By
default, all the colors in the ramp are
printable. Just be sure to choose your
colors by clicking in the ramp.
6.
Be on the lookout for a small cube icon.
Click either the icon or the square to
use the closest Web-safe color.
The cube indicates that the color you
mixed is not a Web-safe color. Clicking
the cube tells Photoshop that you want
to use its Web-safe alternative instead.
A Web-safe color ensures that the color
will not dither (mixing available colors
to simulate a missing color) when dis-
played in the browser.

One thing that you do find in the Color Picker
that is absent from the Color Palette is the ability
to select custom colors, which are also known as
spot colors. Spot colors are premixed inks used in
printing and manufactured by various compa-
nies such as Pantone or Trumatch. You can use
spot colors in addition to or in lieu of CMYK
colors in the printing process. To pick a custom
color, follow these steps:
1. Click the Custom button in the Color
Picker dialog box.
The Custom Colors dialog box opens, as
shown in the following figure.
2. Choose your desired custom color
book from the pop-up menu and then
select your color from the scrolling list
of swatches.
3. Click OK to accept the color as your
new foreground or background color,
or click the Picker button to return to
the Color Picker.
Do not choose spot colors visually; choose them
from a printed swatch book published by the ink
manufacturer. The books, which provide the
numeric values for each spot color, provide a
true representation of how the color will appear
when printed.
During the RIP (raster image processing) — the
process your image goes through to create color
separations for printing — Photoshop converts
custom colors to CMYK for every image mode
(except Duotone), unless you create spot color
channels. For more on this technique, see Book
X, Chapter 2. For more on image modes, see
Book II, Chapter 2.

Grabbing color from the Swatches palette
Another way to define a foreground or background color is by clicking a color in the Swatches
palette, shown in Figure 3-4. Choose Window➪Swatches to bring up the palette.
You can have any tool active when you use the Swatches palette to define a color because as
soon as you move the tool over the Swatches palette, it changes to an eyedropper icon that
samples the color. (You’re still using whatever tool is active; the cursor simply changes to
indicate that you temporarily have the capabilities of the Eyedropper tool.)
Besides being a way to select your foreground and background colors, the Swatches palette
acts like a traditional artist’s paint palette in digital form by letting you store as many colors
as you want in the palette for later use.

To change the background color, either select the background swatch icon in the Color
palette or simply Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) a swatch.
Here are some of the things you can do with the Swatches palette:

Customize the Swatches palette’s display. You can choose how to display the Swatches
palette by choosing Small Thumbnail (swatch thumbnails) or Small List (swatch thumb-
nails along with a name) from the Swatches palette pop-up menu (click the right-pointing
triangle in the upper right to open the menu).

Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, choose it from the list on
the Swatches palette pop-up menu. Click Append to add the library to the existing
swatches or OK to replace the existing swatches. You will find libraries specific for Web
graphics and for implementing spot colors such as those created by Pantone, Toyo, and
Focoltone. You can also select Load Swatches from the Swatches palette pop-up menu.
In the Load dialog box, navigate to the Color Swatches folder by following this path:
Adobe Photoshop➪Presets➪Color Swatches; and select your desired library.
You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager. For more on the Preset
Manager, see Book I, Chapter 6.

Customize your own Swatches palette. To add a color to the Swatches palette, do one
of the following:
 Click the New Swatch icon (the dog-eared page icon) at the bottom of the Swatches
palette.
 Choose New Swatch from the Swatches palette pop-up menu. Name your swatch and
click OK.
 Click an empty spot in the Swatches palette (your cursor changes to a Paint Bucket
icon). Name your swatch and click OK. Or Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) on an
empty spot to add the color and bypass the Name dialog box.

Delete swatches that you don’t want anymore. To delete a swatch, drag it to the trash
can icon at the bottom of the Swatches palette. Or Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac)
over a swatch. Your cursor changes to a pair of scissors.

Create your own library of swatches. To save a set of swatches as a library, choose
Save Swatches from the Swatches palette pop-up menu. Navigate to the folder you want
to save the library in.
I recommend saving libraries in a subfolder of the Presets folder. Follow this path: Adobe
Photoshop➪Presets➪Swatches; then create your own folder, name the file, and click Save.

Restore your default swatch libraries. To return to the default library of swatches,
choose Reset Swatches from the Swatches palette pop-up menu. You can choose to
either replace or append to the current library.

Lifting and sampling color 
Photoshop lets you change foreground or background colors by lifting them from the image
with the Eyedropper tool. Using the Eyedropper tool comes in handy when you want to sample
an existing color in an image for use in another element. For example, if I want my text to be
the same color as the flower in my image, I click a petal with my Eyedropper tool, which then

Defining Color

lifts (samples) the color and makes it my new foreground color. I then create my type, which
uses that foreground color. Voilà — color coordination at its finest.
Here are some handy tips for using the Eyedropper tool to suck up color from one place and
use it elsewhere in your image:

Choose any color you want from any image that’s open. If you have multiple images
open, you can also click inside an image that you’re not working on. In fact, if that
doesn’t knock your socks off, you can lift any color you see on-screen, even from a file
in another application such as Illustrator or from your desktop. Just drag your
Eyedropper from the image window onto the color you want to sample.

Choose your sampling area. You have only one option (found in the Options bar) to
worry about when using the Eyedropper tool. You have the option of selecting the color
of just the single pixel you click (Point Sample). Or Photoshop will average the colors of
the pixels in a 3-x-3- or 5-x-5-pixel radius.

Make colors Web safe with a right-click of your mouse button. For you Webbies out
there, if you right-click (Ctrl+click on the Mac) on your image to bring up the context
menu, you have one more option — Copy Color as HTML. This option converts the sam-
pled color to a Hexadecimal color code that’s safe for the Web and copies the code to
the Clipboard so that you can paste the code into an HTML file.

Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. For your productive painting pleas-
ure, when you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Gradient, Paint Bucket, or Shape tool, pressing
Alt (Option on the Mac) allows you to temporarily access the Eyedropper tool. Release
the key and return to your original tool.

Toggle between the background and the foreground. If the foreground color swatch is
active, press Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) with the Eyedropper tool to lift a new
background color. If the background color swatch is active, pressing Alt+click
(Option+click on the Mac) lifts a new foreground color.
To use the Eyedropper tool, you first need to decide whether you want to change the fore-
ground or background color. Then follow these steps:

Using the Color Sampler tool to measure color
The Eyedropper’s cousin, the Color Sampler tool, looks like an eyedropper with a small target
next to the icon. It also shares the Eyedropper’s flyout menu.
The moniker of “Sampler” is kind of misleading because this tool only measures the colors you
click. Aside from merely obtaining the numeric value of a color, another use of the Color Sampler
tool is to monitor changes to your image after you apply color-correction techniques and filters.

Follow these steps to use the Color Sampler tool:
1.
Select the Color Sampler tool in the
Tools palette and then click the color
you want to measure.
Note the target icon that appears on
your image. It is labeled as #1.
Photoshop automatically opens the
Info palette and shows you the numeric
values for that color, as shown in
Figure 3-5.
2.
Repeat Step 1 up to three more times
for a total of four targeted colors.
Target icons appear for your second,
third, and fourth samples.

With the Color Sampler tool, drag the
targets to sample new areas of your
image if you want. Delete a target by
Alt+clicking (Option+clicking) it.
You can actually measure a fifth color by
just moving the Color Sampler cursor
around the image. The numeric value dis-

Color Management Essentials

Color Management Essentials
Grab some Tylenol. You’re about to delve into the rather confusing and sometimes cantanker-
ous world (or as some users would call it — underworld) of color management. It is, by far,
the biggest headache of every graphics professional’s day-to-day experience. And I’m sure
quite a few home users also scratch their heads wondering why their digital photo looked
so great on-screen and turned into a muddy mess on paper.
Reproducing color is not an exact science. In fact, sometimes you would think it takes an act
of voodoo magic to get the output you want. Don’t throw up your hands and live with what-
ever output comes out the other end; if you can’t change the color, you can at least change
your attitude toward color. Getting a handle on color management requires four things —
some knowledge, some patience, a significant amount of time to experiment and test, and,
most importantly, acceptance. Acceptance of the unfortunate fact that we don’t live in a
WYSIWYG world. What you get in one medium is sometimes merely an approximation of
what you see in another.
Why? Well, I’ll start with the basic gripe of many users as they look disapprovingly at their
printout — “But it didn’t look like that on the screen!” As detailed in Book II, Chapter 2, there
are two major color models — RGB (Red-Green-Blue) and CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black).
The RGB color model (16.7 million colors), which all monitors use, has a significantly wider
range of color (called a gamut in computer lingo) than the CMYK color model (approximately
55,000 colors) that is used by printers. The result is that many of the colors you see on-screen
fall outside the CMYK gamut and therefore cannot be reproduced on paper. And in some
cases, some CMYK colors fall outside the RGB gamut. Programs such as Photoshop try to do
their best by providing colors that are the closest match. But those bright and vibrant colors
that are out of gamut are matched with duller, darker versions at best.
And if that difference alone isn’t enough to complicate matters, hardware devices that share
the same color model can possess different gamuts within the same color model. For example,
the RGB color space of a monitor can differ from the RGB color space of a scanner. Not only
that, but you can also have different color spaces within the same type of device. A 15-inch
generic monitor won’t display color equal to a 21-inch Sony Trinitron monitor. Likewise, an
Epson printer may not share the same color space as a Hewlett-Packard or Lexmark printer.
So when you take into account the differences that can occur between platforms, monitors,
printers, browsers, scanners, applications, paper and other substrates, or any of the almost
infinite number of possible permutations, it makes you want to return to the days of quill and
parchment. Techies often call this mind-numbingly large number of possible inconsistencies
device-dependent color. In other words, the color is dependent upon the hardware device. And
device-dependent color varies. That’s just the cold, harsh reality, and nothing’s changing that.
But Adobe, being the kind and benevolent software mega giant that it is, has developed (first
introduced in Version 5.0) a color management system designed to be device independent.
The five-cent explanation of this system is that you first identify your working color spaces.
Photoshop then tags your files with that color space by embedding a color profile (also known
as an ICC profile) with your files. The program then analyzes any color space in which you
either view or output a file and makes adjustments on the fly so that the color is viewed and
printed reasonably accurately and consistently, in theory, independent of the device.
Photoshop also reads the embedded color profile (or lack thereof) of any file you open and
addresses how you wish to deal with that profile if it doesn’t match your working color space.

172
In the upcoming sections, I give you the 25-cent explanation — which I hope is enough to
get you managing color. If color management is an extremely critical workflow issue to you,
I recommend buying a book or two strictly devoted to nothing but managing color. It is well
worth the dollars.
Setting up your work environment
One aspect of color management that people often overlook is setting up a good working envi-
ronment for digital image editing. You may wave your hand impatiently and say, “Yeah, yeah, I
just want to get to the important stuff.” This is the important stuff.
Don’t worry. Setting up a good work environment won’t cost you anything. Just do these
things:

Do always keep your computer desktop a neutral gray. I know having dancing bears and
family photos in the background is tempting, but these elements don’t contribute to a
good viewing environment. Colors and patterns behind your images influence the way
that you view those images. Creating a neutral, gray desktop is the closest you can get
to mounting your work on gray, black, or white mat board (and not neon green or pais-
ley) the way professional graphic designers and photographers do.

Do keep your lighting as consistent as possible. Avoid working on or viewing images in
full, bright afternoon sun and then again under a single desk lamp late at night. Keep the
level and intensity as consistent as possible, and be sure to look at your source mate-
rial, along with the images you’re working on, under the same intensity of light.
Likewise, view on-screen images and your printed output under the same lighting,
thereby establishing a consistent benchmark to use in your Photoshop editing sessions.
Variations in lighting can cause you to perceive color differently and can then lead to
color shifts in your output. And whatever you do, please, no disco balls.
If your desk is next to a window, you may want to invest in a monitor hood or visor to cut
down on screen glare and reflections. They run around $15 to $100. And if you find you
really want an optimum lighting situation, you can look into a couple of additional devices.
Task lamps provide consistent full spectrum light and enable you to see color with more
accuracy and clarity. They run $50 to $200 and even help to cut down on eyestrain. A light
box (or light booth or color viewing booth) offers various lighting environments, from fluo-
rescent to daylight. Professional grade light boxes adhere to lighting standards developed by
ISO (International Standards Organization). They allow you to view images in a consistent
and controlled environment. Depending on the make and the model, the cost of a light box
ranges from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.

Do keep the walls of your work environment as neutral as your monitor desktop. You
don’t have to paint your office gray, but try to avoid lots of colorful posters and artwork
in your direct line of vision (around and behind your monitor).

Speaking of monitors, if you are using an LCD (flat screen) monitor, rather than a real-
estate hogging CRT monitor, do be sure you are sitting directly in front of it, because
color shifts quite a bit on LCDs if you are viewing it at even a slight angle. So no slump-
ing in your chair! 

Color Management Essentials
173

And because you shouldn’t slump, for many reasons, do make sure you have a comfort-
able desk and chair. I mean, let’s be honest, if your back or neck is screaming with pain
while you are trying to edit an image, you won’t last long. Invest in a chair with good
support. If you experience wrist or hand strain, check out those squishy gel pads for
your mouse and keyboard. It is amazing how much those little buggers can help.

For print work, do keep a swatch book (or two) handy, such as those from Pantone or
Trumatch, to choose your colors. Don’t make a decision based on what you see on-
screen. These books give you a true representation of how color looks when printed on
paper.
I recommend getting a swatch book that shows both spot (premixed inks of a single color)
and process colors (colors made by mixing the four process colors — Cyan, Magenta, Yellow,
and Black [CMYK]).
Be prepared for a healthy monetary investment when you buy a swatch book. These little bug-
gers can cost anywhere from $75 to $200 and need to be replaced over time as the colors can
fade. Keep them in a dark location to extend their life span. You can purchase swatch books
from some larger art supply stores or order them online. You can purchase Pantone books
from www.pantone.com. Do a search for others such as Trumatch, Focoltone, and Toyo.

If you buy imaging or printing services, do spend some time finding the best service
bureau and printer in your area and develop a good working relationship. Most likely,
you’ll run into a digital color expert or two hanging around. You should also stick with
that vendor for all your products — scans, prints, Kodak Photo CDs, slides, and so on.
You’ll know what to expect in terms of color and quality, and you’ll get better customer
service by being a regular.

Do take some time to test your workflow (production methods) and your computer
system. Scan images using multiple settings, print images using multiple settings, and
view your images using different browsers on different monitors and different platforms.
Get to know the strengths and limitations and quirks of every piece of your equipment.
Experiment with Photoshop. I know, I know, you have a life. But trust me, it will be an
investment with great returns.
Calibrating your monitor
Calibrating your monitor and creating an ICC profile of your monitor ensures that your moni-
tor doesn’t display any red, green, or blue color casts and that it provides as neutral a gray
screen as possible. Calibration is incredibly important if you want to standardize your image
display — knowing that how you view your image today will be how you view your image
tomorrow or next week.
If you really want to do a great calibration job, consider investing in a combination hardware/
software calibration package. These products used to be really pricey, but you can get a decent
package for around $250. You can choose from several manufacturers. ColorVision (www.
colorcal.com), for example, offers more than one program. The package includes software
that displays color swatches on your screen. Then a photoelectric device, called a colorimeter,
attaches to your monitor with a suction cup. The sensors in the colorimeter measure the color,
brightness, and other characteristics of the monitor. The software then takes the data, adjusts
the monitor, and creates a profile from the data. 
Book
II
Chapter
3

Book II  Chapter 3: Using and Managing Color
174
If more software isn’t within your budget, you can use the simple calibration tool that comes
with Photoshop (Windows) or your system software (Mac).
Turn on your monitor and let it warm up at least an hour. Then, if you’re a Windows user, you
can use Photoshop’s Adobe Gamma utility. (Look for it in the Control Panel on the Windows
Start menu.) You can either use the Gamma utility’s wizard, shown in Figure 3-6, which walks
you through the calibration process by asking you a series of questions, or manually calibrate
your monitor by using sliders in the Adobe Gamma control panel.
If you’re a Mac OS X user, you can use the Display Calibrator Assistant. Choose Apple➪System
Preferences➪Displays➪Color. Click the Color tab and then click the Calibrate button. Answer
the questions in the Display Calibrator Assistant. (See Figure 3-7.)
Both utilities, Adobe Gamma and the Display Calibrator Assistant, help you remove any color
casts and get as neutral a gray background as you can. They also create a profile of your moni-
tor for Photoshop, Illustrator, and other programs so that those applications know how your
monitor displays color.
When you calibrate your monitor, display an image for which you already know the color values.
For example, use an image that you’ve worked with and for which you have a good print and
then use that image each and every time you calibrate. Your goal is to match the digital image
on your screen to the printed image. You should calibrate every so often because monitors can
drift and degrade. Some experts say weekly; others are more liberal and say monthly is fine.
You can also find various calibration utilities on the Web. Here are just a few. Do a search and
I’m sure you’ll find a ton more.

Establishing Your Settings

By the way, not only is letting your monitor warm up a prerequisite before you calibrate, it is
also a good idea before you sit down to tackle any image adjustment work.
Establishing Your Settings
After you have calibrated your monitor (see the preceding section) and adequately arranged
your work environment, you need to nail down the color settings and make sure that they’re
the right match for your intended output.
Choose Edit➪Color Settings (Preferences➪Color Settings on the Mac). The intimidating Color
Settings dialog box rears its ugly head, as shown in Figure 3-8.
As you’re perusing the dialog box, hover your cursor over any item, and a great description
of that item appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
In the Color Settings dialog box, you can choose from predefined settings established for spe-
cific types of output, or you can customize your own settings to fit your individual needs. And
there’s no law that says that you can’t have multiple groups of settings — one for each type of
project. Maybe you create both Web and print graphics. In that case, you may want to have a
set of options for each workflow.
The following sections offer more details about the settings you can choose in the Color
Settings dialog box.

Handling Photoshop’s predefined settings
In the Color Settings dialog box, Photoshop allows you to take the easy route and choose from
a long list of predefined color settings based on your desired output.
After you’ve set up the predefined settings, Photoshop provides all the appropriate working
color spaces and color management policies you need to get good color results. Being the
smart program that it is, Photoshop won’t steer you down the wrong path with its predefined
settings. The only way you can mess up the predefined settings is if your output doesn’t
match the setting. Say you choose the Web Graphics Defaults setting for your high-end, four-
color print job; you’ll be in for a surprise. (Hint: You may want to change those settings.)
Here is a brief description of the predefined color settings in the Color Settings dialog box:

Custom: Allows you to manually assign your own settings. When you define a custom
configuration, save your settings so that you can reload them later if necessary.

Color Management Off: Deactivates Photoshop’s color management system. I recom-
mend it for video output but not for anything else, unless you’re a color guru and know
what you’re doing.

ColorSync Workflow (Mac only): Uses ColorSync 3.0 Color Management System and
ColorSync profiles. It’s not recognized by the Windows platform.


North America General Purpose Defaults: Provides general color settings for using
Adobe software in North America. Uses the same CMYK, Grayscale, and Spot working
spaces as the U.S. Prepress Default, but uses the same RGB working space as the Web
Graphics Default.

Photoshop 5 Default Spaces: Uses the default color settings found in Photoshop 5, the
first version to use color management.

U.S. Prepress Defaults: Provides the settings for printing in the United States. This is a
good overall selection if you use Photoshop mainly for print work.

Web Graphics Defaults: Provides the settings for Web graphics. If you use Photoshop
primarily for Web content, this setting is a good option because it reflects the average
PC monitor.
You can always use a predefined setting as a starting point and adjust whatever individual
settings you need to. Note that if you do, your predefined setting name automatically
changes to Custom.
Indicating your working spaces
If you choose one of the predefined color settings, Photoshop plugs in all the necessary
remaining options in the dialog box. (If you select the Custom option, Photoshop leaves what-
ever settings were there previously because it knows you are going to choose your own set-
tings anyway.)
When you chose one of the predefined color settings, the first group of settings Photoshop
plugged in were your working spaces. Working spaces are the color profiles associated with
the RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and Spot color modes. If you choose the Custom color setting, you
need to choose your own working spaces.
Each of the four working spaces is equally important, so I advise you to read all the following
sections — and read them in order — if you’re serious about color management.

After you set RGB working spaces, don’t forget that you also have to configure the other
three working spaces, as described in the following sections.

After You Define Your Settings
179
CMYK working spaces
CMYK working spaces are a little more involved than RGB options, listed in the preceding
section. They serve a threefold purpose:

CMYK is the color space to which Photoshop converts your RGB file when you choose
Image➪Mode➪CMYK.

CMYK is the color space you will view your RGB image in when you choose View➪Proof
Setup➪Working CMYK (see the upcoming section on soft proofing colors).

The CMYK color space determines how a CMYK file is displayed on an RGB monitor.
There are specific color profiles for printing in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Those
four CMYK options are divided between those for coated and uncoated paper, and sheet-fed
or Web printing presses. The latter two have different percentages of ink coverage and paper
stock. I would leave the setting at U.S. Web Coated (SWOP)v2 unless your commercial
printer tells you otherwise.
Grayscale working spaces
Grayscale working spaces have to do with two parameters — viewing and dot gain of
grayscale images (Image➪Mode➪Grayscale). You can choose Gray Gamma 1.8 for a Macintosh
monitor or Gray Gamma 2.2 for a PC monitor. You can also view an image according to how it
will print, based on typical dot gain.
Dot gain is how much ink the paper absorbs, thereby increasing the size of every halftone dot.
When continuous-tone images are digitized, they are converted into a series of dots known as
a halftone.
If you’re preparing graphics for the Web, you may want to set your working space to Gray
Gamma 2.2 — whether or not you’re using a Mac — because most of the Web surfers world-
wide are PC users.
For print work, leave the setting at Dot Gain 20% unless your commercial printer tells you
otherwise.
Don’t forget — you still have to adjust another working space.
Spot working spaces
Spot working spaces have to do with spot colors. Spot colors are premixed inks that are
printed in addition to, or in lieu of, the four process colors — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
Unless your commercial printer tells you otherwise, stick with a setting of Dot Gain 20%.
After You Define Your Settings
Your specified working space acts as the default color profile for any new images you create.
That means that every file you create on your computer now uses the colors within the gamut
of your color profiles (either RGB or CMYK depending on your document color mode).
Book
II
Chapter
3

Book II  Chapter 3: Using and Managing Color
180
Any images that are untagged — that don’t already have an embedded profile (for example,
Photoshop files created before Version 5) — also use your working spaces.
In addition, your working spaces also define how Photoshop converts your images. For exam-
ple, say your CMYK working space is U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2. When you convert an RGB
image to CMYK (Image➪Mode➪CMYK) prior to sending it off to the printer, Photoshop automat-
ically tags the image with the U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2 color profile. (If this looks like a whole
lot of letters jumbled together, read the sections devoted to RGB and CMYK working spaces.)
When you save your file, make sure that you select the Embed Color Profile option in the
Save dialog box, if it’s available. (Some file formats don’t support color profiles.) This ensures
that Photoshop tags the file with the specified color profile and that its origins are always
known.
Setting Color Management Policies
After you’ve established working color spaces, the next step is to establish the default color
management policy for each color mode. In other words, you need to tell Photoshop how to
interpret and manage the color profiles of files it opens.
Photoshop looks at the color profile of an opened or imported file, compares it to your work-
ing spaces, and then employs the default policies you have established. If the files it opens
have been embedded with the same color profile as yours, there isn’t an issue. You’re good to
go. But sometimes this isn’t the case:

You may open files that have no profile. These can be older files, files that were cre-
ated with color management turned off, or files created in other applications that do
not employ color management.

You may open a file that has a color profile that doesn’t match your working space.
Say that you have a Web designer friend, and his settings are based on the Web
Graphics Defaults. He gives you a file, and you open it on your computer. You do mostly
print work, so your settings are the U.S. Prepress Defaults. He gives you a file, which
you open in Photoshop on your computer. Photoshop then displays an alert that says
the file has an embedded color profile that doesn’t match your current RGB working
space — his working space is sRGB and yours is Adobe RGB (1998). The alert then goes
on to describe the default policy that is invoked on the file, as shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9

Setting Color Management Policies
181
Again, if you have selected a predefined setting, the policies have already been established
for you, and those should work fine. I do recommend, however, that you change the policies
of one of the predefined settings. If you choose Web Graphics Defaults, the Color
Management Policies options are all set to Off. Unless you have a good reason not to,
change these to Convert to Working RGB. Remember color management is a good thing.
Here are the three policy options:

Off: This option turns color management off for any new files you create, import, or
open. However, if the opened or imported file’s color profile matches your current
working space, the profile is preserved.

Preserve Embedded Profiles: This option displays the files in their original embedded
color space. No color conversion occurs. Untagged files remain untagged but use the
current working space for display.

Convert to Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, depending on your image mode):
This option converts any files with missing or mismatched embedded profiles to your
working RGB space. Untagged files remain untagged but use the current working space
for display.
The next decision you have to make is whether you want Photoshop to automatically invoke
your default management policies or you want to be able to evaluate them on a file-by-file basis.
If you do not select the Ask When Opening option for Profile Mismatches and Missing Profiles,
Photoshop displays the Embedded Profile Mismatch alert message (refer to Figure 3-9), describ-
ing what default policy will occur. You can then select the Don’t Show Again check box, and from
that point forward, Photoshop executes the policy without displaying an alert. For files with
missing profiles, Photoshop simply invokes the default policy without an alert.
If you select the Ask When Opening option for Profile Mismatches, Photoshop not only dis-
plays an Embedded Profile Mismatch alert, but also provides you with options for handling
the color of that file, thereby overriding the default policy, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-10
Book
II
Chapter
3

Book II  Chapter 3: Using and Managing Color
182
The options are similar to the default policies of the Color Settings dialog box:

Use the Embedded Profile (Instead of the Working Space): Photoshop displays the file
in its original embedded color space and does not perform any color conversions.

Convert Document’s Colors to the Working Space: Photoshop converts the file from its
embedded color space to your working color space.

Discard the Embedded Profile (Don’t Color Manage): Photoshop doesn’t utilize any
color management when opening files but displays the file in your working space.
Be cautious about making any CMYK conversions. If you encounter a Profile Mismatch with
a CMYK image, you will probably want to preserve the image’s embedded profile unless
you’re absolutely sure it should be converted to another CMYK working space. But, if the
image doesn’t have a profile, then by all means convert it to your CMYK working space.
If you select the Ask When Pasting option for Profile Mismatches, Photoshop prompts you
when you drag and drop layers or selections that have the same color mode (see Book II,
Chapter 2, for more on modes) but different color profiles. In the Paste Profile Mismatch
alert dialog box, you have two options:

Convert (Preserve Color Appearance): Photoshop converts and matches the appear-
ance of the color rather than the RGB numerical values. For example, the RGB color of
R 152, G 122, B 250 may be a different shade of purple in one RGB working space versus
another. If you preserve the numerical values, the shades won’t match. If you preserve
the appearance, Photoshop attempts to maintain the two shades.

Don’t Convert (Preserve Color Number): Photoshop does not convert the appearance
of the color but instead matches the RGB numerical values.
If you don’t select the Ask When Pasting check box, Photoshop pastes the color appearance
between RGB images and pastes the numerical values between CMYK images.
If you select the Ask When Opening option for Missing Profiles, Photoshop displays a Missing
Profile alert and also provides you with the following options, as shown in Figure 3-11:
Figure 3-11

Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications
183

Leave As Is (Don’t Color Manage): This leaves the image untagged and without a color
profile, but displays the image in your working space.

Assign Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, depending on your image mode): your
working space: Photoshop tags the image with your working space and displays it in
that working space. If you change your working space, the image retains the old work-
ing space.

Assign Profile: This option allows you to assign any color profile contained within the
pop-up menu. You can use this option if you know where the untagged image originated.
For example, if you scanned your image and your scanner doesn’t embed profiles, you
can assign the scanner profile.
Unless you have a specific reason not to, I recommend that you assign your working RGB
space to those orphan files.
I recommend selecting the Ask When Opening and Ask When Pasting check boxes. That way
you know when a profile mismatch occurs and you have the choice of picking your course of
action, which includes overriding the defaults you set in the policy settings. This allows you
to evaluate whether you want to preserve or convert on a file-by-file basis.
For example, if you’re a print designer, and a Web designer gives you a file, you get a profile
mismatch alerting you that the file has the sRGB color space and that it doesn’t match your
working space of Adobe RGB (1998). If you’re going to use the image as-is for Web content,
you tell Photoshop to preserve the embedded profile and not to make any conversion. But if
you want to repurpose the image (for, say, a logo), you have to instruct Photoshop to convert
the file to your working RGB space. (Of course, ultimately, you have to also convert the image
mode to CMYK for printing purposes.)
To find out the color profile of an image, choose Document Profile from the pop-up menu at
the bottom of the image window (described in detail in Book I, Chapter 1). Also if an image
has a color profile that differs from your working space, an asterisk appears in the title bar.
An untagged image displays a pound sign.
By the way, when you select the Advanced Mode option, you have a few additional options
regarding color conversion engines and rendering intents, which are methods of color transla-
tion. I recommend putting your trust in Photoshop and leaving these options at their defaults,
unless you’re a bona fide color expert.
Getting Consistent Color among Adobe Applications
If you have a complete Adobe workflow like I do, you’ll want to use the same Color Settings for
all your Adobe applications. Illustrator, InDesign, and Acrobat share a similar Color Settings
dialog box. They have a few minor differences, but nothing major. If an element doesn’t exist
in one application’s Color Settings dialog box, Adobe merely plugs in the default setting. You
can save your Color Settings in Photoshop by clicking the Save button in the Color Settings
dialog box. To ensure that all your Adobe applications can access the settings file, save it to
a default location:
Book
II
Chapter
3

Book II  Chapter 3: Using and Managing Color
184

For Microsoft Windows, the default location is the Program Files/Common Files/
Adobe/Color/Settings folder.

For Mac OS X users, the default folder is User/CurrentUser/Library/
ApplicationSupport/Adobe/Color/Settings.
Launch your other applications, open the Color Settings dialog box, and click the Load button.
Navigate to the saved settings file and select it. You are all set for color consistency among
applications.
Reassigning, Removing, or Converting Color Profiles
Before you read this section, let me gently note that the operations described are really for
advanced users. Although these aren’t overly difficult, you should know why you’re doing a
particular operation and have a good reason for doing it. That said, once in a great while, you
may want to either assign a different color profile to an image without converting the color,
convert an image’s color profile, or on a very rare occasion, eliminate the color profile of your
image altogether. For example, say you’re a photographer and you need to take a folder of
photos and hand them off to a Web design firm. In that case, you may want to change the
Adobe RGB (1998) color profile of those images to sRGB.
To reassign or eliminate a color profile, choose Image➪Mode➪Assign Profile and select one of
the following three options, shown in Figure 3-12:

Don’t Color Manage This Document: Strips the color profile and doesn’t employ color
management.

Working RGB (or CMYK or Grayscale, depending on your color mode): your working
space: Assigns your current working space to a file that either is untagged or has a dif-
ferent color profile than your working space.

Profile: Choose the color profile you want from the pop-up menu. Photoshop assigns
that profile to the file but doesn’t convert the colors to that profile. Be aware that this
option may drastically change the appearance of the colors because the color numbers
are retained (the numeric value of the color) in the new color profile.
Make sure that you have the Preview check box selected so you can see the result of your
action.
To convert to another color profile, choose Image➪Mode➪Convert to Profile. Choose your
desired color profile for conversion from the Profile pop-up menu, shown in Figure 3-13. Your
Figure 3-12

Soft Proofing Colors

file is now converted and tagged with this color profile. You can also specify the color man-
agement engine (specifies the color matching method), rendering intent (the method used for
color translation), and whether to use black point compensation (when selected, the full
dynamic range is mapped to the destination space), and dithering options (colors are mixed
to simulate a missing color in the destination space). Again, unless you are a real color guru, I
recommend taking Adobe’s word for it and leaving the default settings for whatever destina-
tion profile you choose. Even if you don’t, I recommend that you select the Use Black Point
Compensation and Use Dither check boxes (unless the size of your Web graphics is critical).
If you have layers, you can choose to flatten all the layers into a single one. I recommend this
because it makes the preview more accurate. Keep the Preview check box selected to view
your conversion.
Soft Proofing Colors
Photoshop allows you to preview on-screen how your image will look on a variety of output
devices. First, choose View➪Proof Setup and select your desired setup. The Working options
are based on the working spaces you specified in the Color Settings dialog box.

Macintosh RGB and Windows RGB display your image as it will appear on a standard
Macintosh or Windows monitor. This can come in handy when you want to see how
your Web graphic will generally look on another platform.

Monitor RGB allows you to view the image by using your current monitor’s color space.
This essentially turns off your RGB working space and lets you see the image without
any color management.

Custom allows you to choose a specific device. For example, choosing U.S. Web Coated
(SWOP)v2 lets you to see how your RGB images will look when they’re converted to
CMYK for printing.
After you have chosen your setup, choose View➪Proof Colors to view the image in your
chosen working space. For the most reliable results, use a good quality monitor. And don’t
forget about the importance of setting up a good viewing environment as well. Also keep in
mind that although soft-proofing is a good thing, it is not a substitute for a good quality hard
copy proof. Some things, such as the type and quality of paper, certain inks, and so on cannot
be accurately simulated on-screen. See Book X, Chapter 2, for details on printing.

W
hen Tom Wolfe said, “You can’t go home again,” he
wasn’t talking about Photoshop. If you change your
mind about something you’ve done and want to return
to your starting place (or any point in between), Photoshop is
very forgiving. My favorite image editor offers many different
ways to reverse actions, undo what you did, reapply effects
you’ve cancelled, and generally change your mind as often as
a new apartment owner deciding where to put the couch.
Photoshop is the ultimate time machine. Not only can you
reverse actions, but you can also go back to the future to
restore them. This flexibility enables you to work on your
image as you please, without worrying that a particular action
will be locked in stone. Confident in your ability to retrace or
repeat your steps as necessary, you can experiment, try
different effects, and be much more creative.
This chapter helps you master Photoshop’s powerful time-
traveling features, including the Undo command, the History
palette, and tools like the Art History Brush tool.
Undoing What’s Done
Photoshop gives you two simple ways to undo your efforts: the
Undo/Redo command and the Revert command. Both are easy
to master, as described in the next few sections.
Using the Undo command
Your first stop in your journey through time is the Undo/Redo
command. This command simply reverses the last action you
took or reapplies it if you just undid something. For example,
if you apply a brush stroke you don’t like, use Undo to remove
that stroke. Then if you immediately change your mind, you
can redo it.

Book II  Chapter 4: Time Travel — Undoing in Photoshop
188
To undo your last action, choose Edit➪Undo or simply press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac).
Use Undo/Redo to toggle an effect on and off to compare the before and after effects
quickly. For example, you can apply a filter, examine the results, and then flip back and forth
between the filtered and unfiltered version by pressing the Undo/Redo shortcut keys rapidly.
When you decide which way to go, stop. This procedure works best if you’ve chosen to press
Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to apply both Undo and Redo.
Remember that Undo/Redo works only for a single command. If you do anything else after
applying a command and then change your mind, you have to resort to one of the other time-
travel techniques described later in this chapter.
If an action can’t be undone or redone, Undo/Redo is grayed out and unavailable. For exam-
ple, if you apply a brush stroke and then save the file to your hard drive, you can no longer
undo the brush stroke. (However, you can use the History palette to remove the brush stroke.
See “Working with the Almighty History Palette,” later in this chapter.)
If you want to free the memory used by the Undo command, choose Edit➪Purge➪Undo. If
the item is grayed out, the buffer is already empty. Note that this action cannot be undone,
so only do it if you notice Photoshop acting sluggish.
Reverting to what’s saved
Revert replaces your current file with the last saved file, effectively wiping out everything
you’ve done since the file was last saved. You can revert to the last version of the file by
choosing File➪Revert (or by pressing F12). You lose all the changes in your current file when
the last saved version replaces it on-screen.
On the surface, Revert seems like an all-or-nothing proposition to be resorted to only when
you’ve given up all hope of salvaging the current file. However, that’s not necessarily the case.
For example, you may find using Revert to produce two versions of an image beneficial.
Perhaps you’ve done some work on an image and now want to compare this version of the
image with a version of the image that you apply an entirely different set of commands to. Just
duplicate the current version (choose Image➪Duplicate) and revert back to its pristine state
to apply the other effects. Then you can compare versions to see which you like best. (This
tactic works only if you haven’t saved the file along the way, of course.) You can use Revert in
this manner as many times as you like to create two, three, or more versions all based on one
original image.
The Revert command is stored on the History palette, so in many cases, you can remove the
Revert command to restore the file to its manipulated state once again. You find out how to
remove a command from the History palette in the next section.
Revert restores only the last saved version of your image. If you open an image, make some
changes, and then save it, Revert backtracks to that saved version, not to the original. That’s
why working with a copy of an image is a good idea, in case at some point you really do
want to go back to the original version.

Working with the Almighty History Palette
189
Working with the Almighty History Palette
Undoing and redoing commands are kid’s stuff next to the power of the almighty History
palette. Think of this tool as a recipe listing all the steps you took to cook up your image in its
present state. Using the History palette, you can browse through the recipe and return to any
step in the list to begin work anew from that point. In this mode, the History palette operates
like a multistep undo process.
Understanding states and snapshots
You can’t go too far in your use of the History palette without understanding two important
concepts, as well as how the concepts are different:

States: States are just another way of saying steps. At any given point in your image-
editing activities, Photoshop saves your individual edits into states. By default,
Photoshop remembers 20 states for an image.

Snapshots: You can save temporary copies of an image, each containing all its various
states. For example, say you make six edits to an image before you take a snapshot. The
snapshot shows the image, but it also contains a complete history of the six states.
Make a few more changes, and take another snapshot: The new snapshot contains the
six states you made previously, as well as any new ones. See “Taking Snapshots,” later
in this chapter, to find out how to use snapshots.
When you have these concepts down, you can get to the business of understanding how the indi-
vidual tools in the History palette use states and snapshots to help you go back in time (and back
to the future again) to undo, redo, and modify each miniscule edit you make to your images.
Changing the default number of steps that the History palette displays
The History palette displays a list of each change you make to your image — every brush
stroke you dab, every deletion you make, every layer you create — up to a default limit of 20
steps, or states. The list begins at the top of the History palette, and Photoshop tacks each
new step on at the bottom. When you reach the limit of 20 steps, the oldest step (at the top of
the list) drops off to make room for the latest one at the bottom.
If you move something repeatedly and don’t choose another tool, all the moves are
considered a single step, until you do select another tool.
If your computer has lots of memory and you want to be able to move back and forth more
than 20 steps, you can increase the number of steps to as many as 1,000 in the General
Preferences dialog box. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪
General in Mac OS X) and enter a new value in the History States box. Keep in mind that
boosting this number can eat up your available memory quite quickly, because after you acti-
vate a higher number of states, Photoshop always stores up to that number every time you
edit an image (even images with which you don’t contemplate needing access to more than 20
steps). A better choice may be to leave the states set to 20 and instead save snapshots of your
image, as described in the following sections.

Introducing History palette options and tools
The History palette has several components you should know about, as shown in Figure 4-1:

Snapshot thumbnail: This is a miniature image of the most recently saved snapshot
image, which is a copy of your document with all the current states included. (For more
on snapshots, see “Taking Snapshots,” later in this chapter.)

Source state column: Click in this column next to a particular snapshot or state, and
when you begin painting with the History Brush tool or when erasing with the Erase to
History option, Photoshop uses the snapshot or state you select as the source.

History state: This is a particular step or edit in your document’s list of steps. An icon
appears in this column showing what kind of action occurred in that state.

Active state marker: This slider points to the currently active state. You can drag it up
or down to change the current state.

Create new document from current state: Click this icon to create a duplicate copy of
your image at the currently selected state. Your new document starts out with a clean
slate and an empty history list.

Create new snapshot: Click this icon to store an image of your document, preserving all
the states listed.

Delete current state: Click this icon to remove a selected state.

Undone states: These are the grayed-out states that are undone when you select an
earlier state in the list.

Open state: This is the original document when first opened.

Current history state: This is the active state you’ve selected in the history list.

Viewing an Image’s Various States
You can move back to any state listed in the History palette, remove a state to cancel a step,
or perform other time-travel stunts with the History palette. The following sections outline
some basic time-shifting techniques you should know.
Going back to a particular state
To go back in time and resume editing at a particular point, just click the state you want to
return to. All subsequent states appear grayed out, or what Adobe calls undone. Then begin
editing your image as usual. As soon as you perform a new step, all the states that follow your
re-entry point vanish. It’s like applying the Undo command to a group of steps with one click.
If you intentionally (or accidentally) begin editing while a previous state is highlighted, and
you change your mind, immediately undo your first action — press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the
Mac). The subsequent steps that were removed reappear.
Reviewing your image at different states
To review how your image looked at various previous states, just click the state you want to
take a look at. (You can also drag the active state marker up and down the list.) The document
image immediately changes to reflect that earlier state. You can move back and forth between
any point in the history list if you like. As long as you don’t make any editing changes during
your time-traveling jaunt, your current history list is preserved.
Removing a state
To remove a state and all the steps that follow it, select the state and then do one of the
following:

Press the Delete key.

Click the trash can icon.

Drag the state’s icon to the trash can icon.

Right-click the state (or Control+click on the Mac) and choose Delete from the context-
sensitive menu that pops up.

Choose Delete from the History palette pop-up menu.
Clearing all states
You can clear all the states from the palette by choosing Clear History from the palette pop-up
menu. To delete all the states except the last one in the history list, as well as keep the snap-
shots you’ve saved, choose Edit➪Purge➪Histories. You can clear or purge your history list
when you don’t need the states that are included anymore, to save memory or to return to the
original state of your document. Just be sure you’re really, seriously, not interested in going
back again later to make changes because this command cannot be undone, with one excep-
tion. You can only undo your clearing or purging if you choose Edit➪Undo immediately after
you execute the command.

Navigating the history list
You can move up and down the history list even if the list isn’t visible on your screen. The
Edit➪Step Forward and Edit➪Step Backward commands move forward and back in the his-
tory list. The best way to access these commands is to use the keyboard shortcuts:

Press Alt+Ctrl+Z (Option+Ô+Z on the Mac) to move backward in time (upward in the
history list).

Press Shift+Ctrl+Z (Shift+Ô+Z on the Mac) to move forward in time (down the history list).
Looking at the History Options Dialog Box
The History palette has four options that change its behavior. To access these options,
choose History Options from the History palette pop-up menu to open the History Options
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-2. The dialog box offers these options:

Automatically Create First Snapshot: This option, selected by default, tells Photoshop
to create a snapshot of the image when you first open it, before you make any changes.
You can return to this snapshot at any time by clicking its name in the History palette.
Keep this option selected. That way, you can always return to your original image if
necessary.

Automatically Create New Snapshot When Saving: This option tells Photoshop to
create a new snapshot each time you save the image. If you’re like me and save every
couple of minutes, you probably won’t want to select this option; otherwise, you end up
with a palette full of unwanted snapshots.

Allow Non-Linear History: This option makes editing or deleting a state without remov-
ing all the states that follow it possible.
When the Non-Linear History capability is active, you can make an editing change to an
intermediate state in the history list, perhaps save the edited state as a snapshot, or
even delete the state, leaving the other steps below it unchanged. (When you delete a
state you’ve edited, the edit you made is added to the end of the history list.)
Use this option with caution because steps are interdependent. A change you’ve removed
may form the basis for another edit later on, so deleting it can cause weird results.

Show New Snapshot Dialog by Default: This option ensures that Photoshop asks you
for a name for any new snapshot you create. Applying names to snapshots makes
reminding yourself of the state of the image when you saved the snapshot easy.

Taking Snapshots
Snapshots are duplicates of your image at a particular point in time, similar to saving a docu-
ment under an alternate name. (Photoshop automatically names the snapshots something
generic like Snapshot 1 or Snapshot 2.) However, snapshots are temporary copies, available
only during your current work session. When you save your image and close it, you lose all
the snapshots. So thinking of snapshots as a way of saving your history lists at various points
in time while you’re working is best.
Snapshots are a handy way to alternate between versions of an image when you’re making
major changes. For example, if you plan to apply several filters that will drastically modify
your image, you may want to save a snapshot before you use the filters and save another one
after you’ve applied them. You can then click either snapshot to switch from one version to
the other quickly.
The second you close a file, the snapshots you’ve taken disappear forever. If you want a
more permanent way of saving versions of your file, see the section on using the new Layer
Comps palette in Book V, Chapter 2.
To take a snapshot, follow these steps:

If you want the New Snapshot dialog box to
open when you create a new snapshot by click-
ing the camera icon, select the Show New
Snapshot Dialog by Default option described in
the preceding section.
Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac)
when you click the camera icon to access the
dialog box even when the Show New Snapshot
Dialog by Default option is deselected. If you
remember this technique, you can alternate
between creating generic snapshots and using
the dialog box.

take a snapshot.
The state can be the most recent one
with all your latest editing changes, or
an earlier state.

Choose New Snapshot from the
palette pop-up menu.
Or right-click (Control+click on the Mac)
the state and choose New Snapshot
from the context-sensitive menu.
The New Snapshot dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 4-3.
If you want to bypass this dialog box,
just click the New Snapshot button to
create a snapshot. Photoshop names
your first snapshot Snapshot 1.
c In the Name box, enter a name for the
snapshot, preferably one that helps
you remember the contents of that
particular snapshot.
You can add or change the name of the
snapshot later by double-clicking the
snapshot name in the history list.

Restoring Part of an Image
Although the concept may seem like quantum physics, you can erase and brush on an image
by using previously saved states or snapshots.
What? Okay, let me try this again. You can erase portions of an image to a history state, as
well as paint on an image from a history state. This means that traveling through time doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing thing; you can erase or paint portions of a different state onto
your currently active state.
For example, suppose you applied a blur filter to a face and decide later you want to make the
eyes sharp again. You can use the Eraser tool with the Erase to History option, or the History
Brush tool, to paint over the eyes with information from an earlier state before you blurred
them, as shown in Figure 4-4.

state or snapshot contains information that you want to include in an image that has other-
wise been extensively edited. To erase and restore to a portion of an earlier state or snapshot,
just follow these steps:

Photoshop removes the image in the
layer and replaces it with the image in
the state you specified as the origin for
the Eraser with the Erase to History
option.
You can convert the Eraser tool temporar-
ily to use the Erase to History option by
holding down the Alt key (Option key on
the Mac) when you erase or paint.

Using the History Brush tool
You can also use the History Brush tool to apply an image area from a different state or snap-
shot to your current state. You’d want to use this tool to restore a portion of an image to an
earlier state, while leaving the rest of the heavily modified image alone. Just follow these steps:

Using the Art History Brush tool
The Art History Brush tool is an interesting variation on the plain old History Brush tool. Both
paint over an image by using information from a previous state. The Art History Brush tool,
however, includes several choices in the Options bar that let you apply brush-stroke effects to
your image as you paint:

Style: The Style menu contains various-shaped brush stroke styles, such as Tight Short,
Loose Medium, Dab, or Loose Curl. Although their names describe the look of the strokes
fairly well, you’ll want to experiment with them to see exactly what they look like.

Area: This option controls the area covered by the paint stroke independently of the
brush size you select. The larger the size, the more area that’s covered, and the more
brush strokes that are applied per movement.

Tolerance: This option adjusts the amount of the change applied to your image. A
low tolerance value lets you apply strokes anywhere in the image, regardless of color
values. A high tolerance limits Art History strokes only to areas that are very different
from the source state or snapshot, thereby making your image not quite as dramatically
different from the original.
The result of using these options is an interesting hand-painted effect that you can control
quite easily after you’ve had some practice.
The Art History Brush tool often works best when you use a state that is quite different from
the state you’re painting over. For example, you can apply a heavy filter that makes the image
almost unrecognizable and then use that filtered image to paint with the Art History Brush
tool. You can even completely fill an image with color or texture and work with that.
To paint with the Art History Brush tool, follow these steps:

Sometimes you may see a No symbol when
trying to use the Eraser with the Erase to History
option, the History Brush tool, or the Fill with
History command. You must be sure that your
current image is the same file size (same number
of pixels) as the state you are trying to go back
to. Actions such as cropping, trimming, using the
Image Size or Canvas Size commands, or rotat-
ing any amount other that 180 degrees can pre-
vent you from going back to a previous state.
However, if you happen to have a square image,
you can rotate in 90-degree increments and still
use the Eraser with the Erase to History option.

E
verybody’s a critic! That’s especially true when you’re
using Photoshop in a work environment — or in any sce-
nario that involves anything but 100 percent freedom to
perform your Photoshop magic as you want. 
Sometimes, you’ll want to collect comments from your col-
leagues, approvals from your supervisors, ideas from your
friends, or nit-picks from your clients. Photoshop lets everyone
have his or her say by using annotations, notes, or audio com-
ments. You can use these clever feedback tools without worrying
about physically modifying the work that you’ve carefully done.
Imagine sticky notes you can move around your screen, and
you’ll see what Photoshop’s Annotations feature can do for you.
Text documents often are distributed for approval in a Portable
Document Format (PDF) format by using Adobe Acrobat Reader,
and comments are added by using the full Acrobat application.
Photoshop is compatible with Acrobat, too, so you can save your
Photoshop files in the PDF format. For more detailed information
on the PDF format, see Adobe Acrobat 6 PDF Bible, by Ted
Padova (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
This chapter provides a quick introduction to Photoshop’s
annotation and audio notes features.
Having Your Say with Notes
and Audio Annotations
Text annotations (which Photoshop calls notes) are text
comments that appear as icons within an image document
when you choose to make them visible. 
If you’re reviewing someone else’s notes, you simply double-
click the note to view it or to modify the text it contains.

You can do lots of things with notes:

Show or hide all the notes: Choose View➪Show➪Annotations.

Expand any note from its icon: Double-click the icon.

Edit a note: Expand the note and revise the text by using standard editing commands.

Delete a note: Select the note and press Delete.

Remove all closed notes: Right-click any note (Ctrl+click on the Mac) and choose
Delete All Annotations from the context menu that pops up. You can also select a note
and click Clear All in the Options bar. This removes all closed notes but doesn’t remove
notes that are open.

Move a note’s icon: Drag the icon. (The note still pops up in its original location, however.)

Relocate a note’s window: Open the note and drag its title bar to the new location.
It then pops up in the new location.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Creating a text annotation
To create a text annotation, follow these steps:
1.
Select the Notes tool in the Tool
palette (or just press N).
2.
If necessary, change the name in the
Author text box in the Options bar.
Just double-click inside the Author text
box, shown at the top of Figure 5-1, and
start typing.
By default, when you create a note, the
name you entered when you installed
Photoshop appears as the author of the
note. However, you may be working on
an image with someone else’s com-
puter, or you may be on the lam and
using an assumed name. 
Be sure that everyone looking at the file
uses a unique name so that you can sort
out the various notes and, perhaps, give all
of them their proper weight (that is, always
do what the boss says, but take Seymour
the intern’s comments with a grain of salt).
3.
From the Font and Size drop-down
lists in the Options bar, choose a font
and font size for the text.
Selecting a particular font and size for
each author may just be a matter of
preference or readability or can be
used to further differentiate between
authors’ comments. You choose font
sizes in relative sizes from Smallest to
Medium to Largest so Photoshop can
adjust the notes to be readable on
monitors set for different resolutions.
4.
Click the Color box on the Options
bar and select a color for the title bar
of each note and the color of its icon
when you minimize the note.
Color-coding is a good way to differen-
tiate authors, as well as priorities. For
example, you can use Red, Yellow, and
Green to indicate relative status of a
particular suggestion, or select a color
to represent a particular author.
5.
Click in the note’s window and type
the text you want to enter, as shown
in Figure 5-1.
You can use traditional editing commands,
such as the Backspace key, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C,
and Ctrl+V (Ô+X, Ô+C, and Ô+V on the
Mac) to edit the text.

Creating an audio note
If you have a microphone connected to your computer, you can add audio notes to your
image files. Audio notes are great for adding annotations that take a long time to type or that
are better explained through audio.
Audio annotations can bloat your file size, so unless using audio annotations is really more
advantageous, stick with text notes.
To add an audio message to your file, just follow these steps:

Importing and Exporting PDF Files with Annotations
You can view PDF or FDF (Forms Data Format) documents that contain annotations, review
the annotations, and make new notes of your own. 
If you want to send an image file to a friend or colleague who doesn’t have Photoshop, you
can still get input. You can even include notes of your own. To export your file (and its anno-
tations) for review in Adobe Acrobat, just save the document and choose PDF as the format.
Then when your Acrobat-using friend sends the file back to you, just follow these steps to
access his or her input:

Photoshop imports the file with the
annotations intact.

P
ractice makes perfect, but when it comes to repeating the
same steps in Photoshop over and over, the result is often
tedium and impatience. You wouldn’t want to have to rein-
vent the wheel each time you wanted to go for a spin around the
block, so why repeat the labor needed to carry out specific tasks
if you don’t have to? Photoshop lets you record steps by using a
fast and fun feature called Actions. Photoshop actions are similar
to the macro recording features found in your word processing
or spreadsheet program, but they’re usually easier to create
and have capabilities custom-tailored for image editing and
customization.
For example, Photoshop has preset actions to create a wood
frame, simulate water reflections, or provide a molten lead
look. You can also use preset actions to create filterlike effects.
And then there are the chores you can automate on your own.
This chapter shows you how to do a few of them and how to
take advantage of Photoshop’s macro recording and editing
capabilities.
Using the Actions Palette
Not surprisingly, a palette is dedicated to the automation of
various chores. To view the Actions palette, choose Window➪
Actions (or press F9), or click the Actions tab in its palette
group or in the Palette Well. You can view the Actions palette
in two different modes, each of which is useful in its own way.
Here’s a short description of each mode:

List mode: List mode, shown in Figure 6-1, is the default
display in which each action is shown as a folderlike
heading. You can open the heading to reveal all the steps
within the action or collapse the heading to hide them.

You operate in List mode when you record an action and when you edit individual
steps. List mode also lets you perform only some of the steps in a macro.

Button mode: Button mode, shown in Figure 6-2, is a convenient, compact mode that
hides all the inner workings of the actions, presenting only a button face that you can
click to trigger a particular macro. Button mode is fast and easy; just click and go.
Getting to know List mode
When you’re working in List mode, the Actions palette has these three columns:

The leftmost column contains check boxes that you can select or deselect to control
what actions are available in Button mode. You can use this column to ensure that
your most commonly used actions are available for use in Button mode and those that
you don’t use very often are hidden.

The second column toggles on or off the display of dialog boxes in actions. Some
actions include options you can select while running the macro. For example, the

Using the Actions Palette
205
Vignette (Selection) action, which creates a faded frame around a selection, includes a
dialog box that lets you specify the width of the fading. This dialog box is shown only
when you select the dialog box column; if you deselect that option, the action uses a
default value of 5 pixels as the width for the feathered effect.

The third and widest column shows the name of the action. Click the right-pointing
arrow to the left of the action’s name to reveal the individual steps of the action. Many
(but not necessarily all) steps have their own arrows, which can expand or collapse to
show or hide the options used to carry out that step. In case you’re curious, the good
folks at Adobe call these twisty-turny arrows disclosure triangles.
At the bottom of the Actions palette in List mode, you find six icons, not all of which are
available at all times. The following list describes the icons from left to right:

Stop Playing/Recording: This icon is active when you’re recording a macro. Click it to
stop recording (or to stop playing back an action).

Begin Recording: Click this icon to begin recording a macro (as described in more
detail later in this chapter).

Play Selection: Click this icon to begin playing a selected action. Playback begins at the
step selected; you can choose the action’s name to start the macro at the beginning, or
expand the macro and select any step to begin playback at that point.

Create New Set: Click this icon to create a new action set (as described later in this
chapter).

Create New Action: Click this icon to begin a new action.

Delete: Click this icon to remove a selection action or step.
You can also find all these commands on the Actions palette pop-up menu.

Introducing Preset Actions
Photoshop’s preset actions are located in a series of files in the Actions folder. The default
actions are loaded by, um, default, when you first open Photoshop. However, other preset
actions are available for you to open and use. They include Frames (for putting frames around
your images), Text Effects (for enhancing your text), and Textures, for adding textures to your
selections.

d You can click in the dialog box
column for several of the steps (Make
Snapshot, Feather, Make Layer, and
Fill). You can select or deselect this
column for a specific step to control
whether the dialog box for that step is
displayed. 
For example, with the Vignette
(Selection) action, if you deselect all the
boxes in the dialog box column except
for the one next to Fill, the action pro-
ceeds without input from you until it
reaches the Fill step. Then the Fill dialog
box pops up, and you can change set-
tings such as the fill color, opacity, and
fill mode. You can also click in the
dialog box column next to the action’s
name to turn on or off all the marked
dialog box steps in the macro.

Preset action options
Here are some other tidbits about using preset actions :

If you saved actions of your own (as described later in this chapter) somewhere other
than the Photoshop Actions folder, you can navigate to that folder by using the usual
file navigation commands.

To remove the existing actions and replace them with the set you are loading, choose
Replace Actions from the palette pop-up menu.

To reset the Actions palette to the Default Actions set (removing all other sets you may
have loaded), choose Reset Actions from the palette pop-up menu.

To clear all actions from the Actions palette, choose Clear Actions from the palette 
pop-up menu. (You might want to do this when creating your own set of actions from
scratch.)

To rename an action set, select it and choose Set Options from the palette pop-up
menu.

Playing a preset action
To play a preset action, just open the file you want to apply the action to and then do one of
the following:

In List mode, select the action you want to play, or expand the action and select the
step you want to begin with. Then click the Play Selection button at the bottom of the
Actions palette. You can also choose Play from the palette pop-up menu.

In Button mode, click the action you want to play. There are no other options.
If you want to play back just one step of an action, say, for testing purposes, select the step
you want to play in List mode and then Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the Play button in
the Actions palette. You can also simply double-click the step in the list while holding down
the Ctrl key (the Ô key on the Mac).

Creating a New Action
The hardest part about creating a new action is figuring out what functions you want to auto-
mate. Think about steps that you carry out over and over, and whether you could be more
productive if you had an action that could do them for you. Then, examine the actual steps

you want to automate so that you can record them. After that, creating a new action involves
little more than starting Photoshop’s macro recorder and carrying out the steps you want to
include in the action. You might want to create your own action to reduce images to a con-
stant 500 pixels wide for display in an eBay auction, for example. Or you might want to save a
bunch of files in a particular format or convert them from RGB color to grayscale. 
Here are the steps to follow to create a new action:
Book
II
Chapter
6
1.
Open an image.
2.
Display the Actions palette in List
mode.
3.
Click the Create New Action button at
the bottom of the Actions palette.
You can also choose New Action from
the palette pop-up menu.
The New Action dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 6-5.
d In the Name text box, enter a name
for the action.
e From the Set pop-up menu, choose the
actions set. If you have more than one
actions set open, choose the actions
set in which you want to place the
new action.
You may want to associate the action
with a button on the keyboard.
Function keys like F2, F3, and so on are
very useful for actions you perform all
the time.
f To associate the action with a func-
tion key shortcut, choose the name of
the function key from the Function
Key drop-down list.
Select the Shift or Control (Ô on the
Mac) check box to use either of these
keys along with the function key.
Any keyboard shortcut you assign to
an action overrides the default func-
tion already assigned to the keyboard
shortcut. You can revert to the original
shortcut by choosing Edit➪Keyboard
Shortcuts. See Book I, Chapter 6, for
details.
g From the Color drop-down list, select
a color to mark your action in Button
mode.
This option enables you to group
related actions by color.
h Click the Record button in the New
Action dialog box to begin recording.
9.
Carry out all the steps you want to
record.
10.
Click the Stop Playing/Recording
button at the bottom of the Actions
palette to finish the action.
Your new action appears in the Actions
palette in both List and Button modes.
Editing and Managing Actions
The first thing you need to do after you create a new action is to try it out by opening an
image and clicking the Play button in the Actions palette. If the action doesn’t perform as you
4

Book II  Chapter 6: Creating Actions for Productivity and Fun
210
expect, you may need to edit your action to fine-tune it. You also may need to edit an action
to add features or change the action’s behavior in some way. For example, you might decide
that you want your resizing action to change the size to 45 percent rather than 50 percent.
Photoshop enables you to edit your actions fairly easily.
You have a lot of editing options; you can change the action’s name, keyboard shortcut, or
color-coding of an action. That’s easy enough: Just double-click the action name in the Actions
palette to enter a new name, or select the action, choose Action Options from the palette pop-
up menu, and change the information as desired. You can also hold down the Alt key (Option
key on the Mac) and click the action’s name in the Actions palette to open the Actions Options
dialog box.
Re-recording an action
As easy as editing an action is, often your best option is to simply re-record the action from
scratch. If the action is not long or complex, you can often re-record it in less time then
editing the existing action takes.
You can re-record an action two ways:

Create a new action from scratch: Perform all the steps again to replace the old action
with a new one, saving the action under the same (or a different) filename.

Use the clever Record Again feature: Photoshop runs through the steps you already
recorded, opening the appropriate dialog boxes used the first time around so you can
enter new values. 
This method is very handy if you just want to change some of the parameters but keep
the steps the same and in the same order. You don’t even have to remember what steps
you used. Photoshop runs through them for you as you record the steps, or macro, again.
To re-record a macro with the Record Again option, select the name of the macro you want to
re-record and choose Record Again from the palette pop-up menu. As the different dialog
boxes appear, enter the values you want and click OK until the macro is finished.
When you play back an action to test it, the action
may run too quickly for you to see exactly what is
going on. To slow things down, choose Playback
Options from the palette pop-up menu, as shown
in the following figure, and choose a playback
speed in the Playback Options dialog box.


Move a step: To move a step from one place in the action to another, click the action
you want to relocate and drag it to its new place in the action list.

Add a step in the middle: To add a new step in the middle of an existing action, select
the step that you want to precede the new step. Click the Record button and perform
the steps you want to add. Click the Stop Recording button when you’re finished.

Add a step to the end: To add a new step at the end of an existing action, select the
name of the action, click the Record button, and perform the steps you want to add.
Click the Stop Recording button when you’re finished.

Remove a step: Click the step you want to delete and either drag the step to the trash
can icon, or click the trash can icon and click OK in the dialog box that pops up. (Hold
down the Alt key [Option key on the Mac] to bypass the dialog box and delete the step
without confirmation.) You can also select a step and choose Delete from the palette
pop-up menu.

Duplicate a step: Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag the step you
want to duplicate to another location in the Actions palette. Photoshop then creates a
copy of the step, leaving the original step where it was. You can also select a step and
choose Duplicate from the palette pop-up menu or click the Create New Action button in
the Actions palette. Photoshop then creates a duplicate step immediately after the one
being copied. You can then drag the duplicate to the position where you want it to appear.
You can also drag a step onto the Create New Action button to duplicate the step.
You can remove or duplicate an entire action by using the procedures described in the
preceding list for removing a step and duplicating a step.

Batch Processing Actions
Photoshop’s Batch feature lets you apply an action to a group of files. Suppose you want to
make changes to a series of files. You could open each file in Photoshop, play the desired
macro, and then save the file. But that might take a few minutes, or much longer if you have a
lot of files to process. If you want to keep your original file, too, you have to remember to save
each file in a new folder. Batch processing can automate tedious chores like this for you.
To check out this useful tool, copy some files (at least five or six) to a new folder and follow
these steps:
5.
Create any new actions you want to
include within the new set.
6.
Select the name of the set and choose
Save Actions from the palette pop-up
menu.
7.
Save the set in the Photoshop Actions
folder or another folder of your
choice.
1.
Make sure that all the files are in a
single folder of their own.
Photoshop by default works on all the
files in a folder. You have to use the File
Browser if you want to choose only
some of them using the Batch feature.
You can find out more about the File
Browser in Book I, Chapter 5.
2.
Choose File➪Automate➪Batch.
The Batch dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 6-6.
3.
From the Set pop-up menu, choose the
set that contains the action you want
to apply.
If you have only one set of Actions
loaded, it appears by default.
d Choose the action you want to apply
from the Action pop-up menu.
5.
From the Source pop-up menu, choose
Folder.
You can also select Opened Files to
process files you already opened in
Photoshop; Import to process a series of
files captured with your scanner or trans-
ferred from your digital camera; or File
Browser to process files you selected in
the File Browser. File Browser is a good
method for processing files that do not
appear in the same folder.
f Click the Choose button, navigate to the
folder you want to use, and click OK (in
Windows) or Choose (in Mac OS).
7.
Select other options in the Source
area, as desired. Here’s a description
of your choices:
 Override Action “Open” Commands:
Normally, Photoshop automatically
opens each of the files in the selected
folder and processes them, so your
action doesn’t need to contain an
Open command. However, if the
macro does contain an Open com-
mand, you’ll want to select this
option to tell Photoshop to substi-
tute files in the selected folder rather
than those that might be specified in
your action’s own Open command.
Don’t select the Override Action “Open”
Commands option if you do want
Photoshop to use files specified by the
action. For example, your action might
open a file and copy its contents to the file
being batch processed. In that case, you
would not want to override the macro’s
Open commands.

 Include All Subfolders: Select this
option to process files in subfolders

 Suppress File Open Options
Dialogs: Select this option to have
Photoshop disregard any options
that could be possibly selected
upon opening a file.
Suppress File Open Options Dialogs is a
new option in Photoshop CS.
 Suppress Color Profile Warnings:
When Photoshop opens a file that
contains its own color profile, it asks
whether you want to use that profile
or Photoshop’s default profile.
Selecting this check box suppresses
that choice; Photoshop always uses
its own default color profile.
h In the Destination area, tell
Photoshop what to do with each file
after it is processed with the macro.
Choose one of the following options
from the drop-down list:
 None: Leaves the file open on your
Photoshop desktop without saving
it (unless the action itself contains a
Save command).
 Save and Close: Closes the files in
the same folder where Photoshop
found them. Your original file is
overwritten, so use this option only
when you don’t want to save the
original or have another copy.
 Folder: Saves the document in a
folder.
i If you chose Folder in Step 8, click the
Choose button and navigate to a desti-
nation folder for your files.
10.
Select the Override Action “Save As”
Commands check box to ignore any
Save As parameters in the action and
use the filenames of the files as speci-
fied in the File Naming section
described in Step 11.
k In the File Naming section, specify
how you want Photoshop to create the
filenames for the new, processed files
by choosing from the pop-up menus.
You can choose options from six pop-
up menus, depending on how long and
complicated you want the filenames to
be. Here are a few suggestions:
 You’ll usually want to choose
Document Name from the first pop-
up menu. If you do that, Photoshop
retains the document name of the
original file. If your documents are
named Sunset.tif, Sunrise.tif,
and Winter.tif, for example, the
processed versions are given
exactly the same names.
There are other choices in the pop-
up menus, such as consecutive
serial numbers or mm/dd/yy
choices, which you can apply if you
want. The serial numbers choices
create consecutive numbers, either
1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-digit numbers, as well
as serial letters, such as a, b, c or A,
B, C, for each file created.
 You’ll usually stick with the file’s
extension in the second pop-up
menu. Choose extension to apply a
lowercase version of the file’s origi-
nal extension, or EXTENSION to
apply an uppercase version.
 Use the four additional pop-up
menus if you want to create longer
and more complicated filenames.
For example, if you choose
Document Name in the first pop-up
menu, 4 Digit Serial Number in the
second pop-up menu, ddmmyy in
the third pop-up menu, and exten-
sion in the fourth pop-up menu (as
shown in Figure 6-6), the
Sunset.tif, Sunrise.tif, and
Winter.tif files are renamed
Sunset0001120302.tif,
Sunrise0002120302.tif, and
Winter0003120302.tif if they’re
saved on December 3, 2002.

Select the Windows, Mac OS, or Unix
check box to specify what operating
system you want the saved filenames
to be most compatible with.
m From the Errors pop-up menu, choose
whether you want Photoshop to stop
processing a batch when it encounters
an error or whether you want it to
simply continue and list the errors in
a file. If you choose the latter option,
click the Save As button to specify a
log file and location for the log.
If you want to apply several different
actions to a single set of files, or to apply
the same action to multiple folders of files,
just create an action that includes multiple
batch-processing directives. To process
multiple folders, you can also deposit
shortcuts (in Windows) or aliases (in Mac
OS) to each of the additional folders in the
main source folder, and then select the
Include All Subfolders check box in the

Creating Droplets
215
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Creating Droplets
Droplets are drag-and-drop miniapplications, or applets, in macro form that can exist outside of
Photoshop on your desktop, in your taskbar, or within a folder. They’re always available so that
you can apply them to any image files you want. Think of them as batches waiting to happen.
Even though you don’t have to be running Photoshop to use droplets, you do need to have
Photoshop installed on your computer. If you move the droplet to another computer that
doesn’t have Photoshop on it, the droplet just sits there and looks pretty.
All you need to do is drag the file or files you want to process onto the droplet. Photoshop
doesn’t even have to be open at the time. When you drop the file or files, the droplet opens
Photoshop and carries out the steps in the action embedded in the droplet’s instructions.
You must use an existing action as the core of the droplet.
To create a droplet, follow these steps:
Book

1.
Choose File➪Automate➪Create
Droplet.
The Create Droplet dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 6-7.
b In the Save Droplet In area, click the
Choose button and enter a name and
location on your hard drive for the
droplet application.
The location isn’t of overriding impor-
tance because after you create the
droplet, you can drag it to your desk-
top, a toolbar, or wherever you like.
The rest of the Create Droplet dialog
box is the same as the Batch
Processing dialog box (described in
the steps in the preceding section),
except that you don’t have to specify a
Source. Droplets use the files dropped
on them as their source files.
3.
In the Play area, choose the actions
set, action, and options.
d Select a destination from the
Destination pop-up menu.
e Specify any file-naming options you
want.
f Specify how Photoshop should
process errors.
7.
When you’re finished, click OK to
create the droplet.
To use the droplet, just select the file,
files, or folders you want to process
and drag them to the droplet applet.

Selections


N
o matter how much you learn about Photoshop, if you
can’t make a good selection, your work will look like it
belongs with the creatively, but poorly, composed images
from one of those weekly tabloid rags. You know what I’m talk-
ing about — those pictures that go alongside headlines like
“Bat Boy Wins Bake-Off” and “Woman with 16 Fingers Wins
Typing Contest.” Those pictures could look better, don’t you
think? It seems like some artists intentionally make their com-
posite photos look like they were constructed with a dull pair
of scissors and some Elmer’s glue.
Making accurate selections is the key to creating and editing
images effectively so that the end result looks flawless.
Fortunately, Photoshop offers a bevy of tools and techniques for
creating selections, from the simple to the complex. Photoshop
offers three basic methods of creating a selection: using a selec-
tion tool or method, using the Pen tool, or creating a mask.
No matter which technique you use, creating selections is
one of the most important skills you can acquire. Trust me
when I say that every minute you spend perfecting your
selection techniques will pay off tenfold.
In this chapter, I give you the foundation you need to use the
selection and pen tools. In fact, the rest of Book III covers these
tools in detail. I cover the more complex method of masking in
Book VI.
Defining Selections
The tools I discuss in this chapter require you to take a little
piece of a larger image so that you can dig in and make some
serious edits. Defining a selection means that you specify which
part of the image you want to work with.

Book III  Chapter 1: Making Selections

Everything within a selection is fair game for manipulation and is considered selected.
Everything outside the selection is protected, or unselected. Simple enough, right? Well, you
can also have partially selected pixels. Confused yet? A partially selected pixel has usually
been anti-aliased, feathered, or masked. (I cover anti-aliasing and feathering later in this chap-
ter. You can find out about masking in Book VI.)
When you use a selection tool to define a selection, a moving dotted outline called a selec-
tion marquee appears.
Marqueeing When You Can
Photoshop geeks call the selection marquee by a variety of names. Sometimes it’s referred to
as a marquee, other times as a selection, and you might even hear people call it a selection
outline, an outline, selection edges, or just plain old edges. A favorite name for these dotted
lines is marching ants. Throughout the book, I usually call them selection marquees. Boring?
Maybe. Accurate? Yup. Whatever you want to call the selection marquee, how you create one
depends on the particular marquee tool you use.
The marquee tools are the easiest selection tools to use — so I suggest that you use them
when you can.
In the Photoshop repertoire of tools, you’ll find four types of marquee tools: Rectangular
Marquee, Elliptical Marquee, Single Row Marquee, and Single Column Marquee.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Using the Rectangular Marquee tool
The first tool on the Marquee tools flyout menu is the Rectangular Marquee tool. (If you
skipped Book I, Chapter 2, a flyout menu describes the hidden tools that appear when you
click any tool in the Tools palette that has a small triangle in the bottom-right corner.) Use this
tool to create rectangular or square selections.
The Rectangular Marquee tool is a good tool to use when you want to zero in on an image,
plucking it out of a larger background to provide a better focal point.
Here’s how to make a selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool:
1.
Select the Rectangular Marquee tool
from the Tools palette (also known as
the Toolbox).
You can also use the keyboard
shortcut — press the M key.
b Drag from one corner of the area you
want to select to the opposite corner.
As you drag, the selection marquee
appears. The marquee follows the
movement of your mouse cursor.
For example, in Figure 1-1, I dragged
from the lower-left corner to the upper-
right corner.
If you want to drag your selection from
the center outward instead of corner to
corner, press the Alt key (Option on the
Mac) after you begin dragging. When you
have your desired selection, release your
mouse button and then release the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key.

221
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Using the Elliptical Marquee tool
The Elliptical Marquee tool is designed for elliptical or circular selections. You can easily
select objects such as clocks, balls, and full moons with this tool.
The Elliptical Marquee tool works almost exactly like the Rectangular Marquee tool
(described in the preceding section). The only difference is that you don’t drag from corner to
corner; you drag from a given point on the ellipse, which makes the process a little tougher.
Here are the steps:
2
Figure 1-1
Book

3.
Release your mouse button.
4.
If you want to create a perfect square,
press the Shift key after you begin
dragging.
When you have your desired selection,
release the mouse button and then the
Shift key.
You now have a full-fledged rectangular
selection.
1.
Select the Elliptical Marquee tool
from the Marquee flyout menu in the
Toolbox.
You can also use the keyboard short-
cut. If the Elliptical Marquee tool is visi-
ble, press the M key. If the Rectangular
Marquee is visible, you must press
Shift+M.
b Position the crosshair (the plus sign
icon of the cursor) near the area you
want to select and then drag around
your desired element.
As you drag, the selection marquee
appears.

Using the Single Column and Single Row Marquee tools
You probably won’t find a lot of uses for the Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools.
These tools select a single row or single column of pixels. If you select a row, the selection can
be only 1 pixel tall. Likewise, if you select a column, it can be only 1 pixel wide.
If you don’t go blind using them, these tools can occasionally come in handy for selecting
and repairing a thin scratch or fold line on an image or for getting rid of an artifact such as a
colored line that has somehow appeared on a scanned image. (You can find out more about
making repairs in Book VIII.)

Figure 1-2
You may find it easier to create an ellipti-
cal selection by pressing the Alt (Option
on the Mac) key and dragging from the
center outward. First click the mouse
button, and then before you move the
mouse, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and
finally the Shift key. Then drag. When you
have your desired selection, release your
mouse button and then the Shift+Alt
(Shift+Option on the Mac) keys. This tech-
nique works for creating circles or squares.
To create a perfect circle, press the Shift
key after you begin dragging. When you
have your desired selection, release your
mouse button and then your Shift key.
3.
When you’re satisfied with your selec-
tion, release your mouse button.
Your elliptical selection is alive and
well, as shown in Figure 1-2. If you need
to move the selection marquee to
better center your selection, click and
drag inside the marquee.
You can also move a selection with any of
the marquee tools by pressing the space-
bar while you’re drawing.
If the selection isn’t quite the right
shape and size, jump to Book III,
Chapter 2, to find out how to make per-
fect selections.

Marqueeing When You Can
223
To use either of these tools, simply choose a row or column of pixels on your image and click
it. You don’t have to do any dragging, but it does help to zoom into your image so that you
can better position the tool on the offending row or column.
For more on zooming, see Book I, Chapter 5. Check out Figure 1-3 to get familiar with a single
row selection.
The Single Row and Single Column Marquee tools don’t have keyboard shortcuts, so you’re
stuck with having to click the tools to select them.
Using the marquee options
If drawing from the center outward or creating a perfect circle or square doesn’t give you
enough control, you may want to take a look at the marquee settings provided by the Options
bar. These options allow you to make even more precise selections by specifying exact
measurements.
You must select the options in the Options bar before you make your selection with the
marquee tools.
Figure 1-3

Chapter

Book III  Chapter 1: Making Selections
224
For now, you can ignore the first five icons on the left of the Options bar, as shown in Figure 1-4.
The first icon has to do with tool presets, which I cover in Book I, Chapter 2. The next four
icons are the selection state icons, which I discuss in Book III, Chapter 3.
Here’s the lowdown on each of the remaining options:

Feather: Feathering blurs or feathers the edges of a selection. The amount of blur
depends on the pixel value that you enter for the radius — the higher the radius, the
blurrier the edge. For example, in Figure 1-5 you see that a higher Feather radius means
a blurrier edge. The radius measures how far in all directions the feather effect extends.
For example, a radius of 4 means that the feather extends 4 pixels to the right, left, up,
and down from the selection outline.
Feather radius
4 pixels
Feather radius
20 pixels
Figure 1-5
Figure 1-4

Marqueeing When You Can
225
You can use feathers to create a subtle and natural transition between selections or to
create a special effect where an image slowly fades out to the background or to trans-
parency. If you want to apply a feather as you are selecting, select the Feather option in
the Options bar before using the marquee tools. However, if you have already made
your selection, you can feather it after the fact by using the Select menu. Check out
Book III, Chapter 2, for more feathering details.

Anti-aliased: Whereas feathering completely blurs edges, anti-aliasing just slightly soft-
ens the edge of an elliptical selection so that very hard, jagged edges aren’t quite so
prominent, as shown in Figure 1-6. You don’t have an option for entering a pixel value
for anti-aliasing. An anti-aliased edge is always 1 pixel wide.
You can use the anti-aliasing option only with the Elliptical Marquee tool. It isn’t avail-
able for the other marquee tools because the selections you make with the other tools
always have straight edges — there aren’t any jagged edges to soften. I recommend
keeping this option selected, especially if you plan to create composite images. Anti-
aliasing helps in creating natural-looking blends between multiple selections.

Style: The Style drop-down list contains three settings:
 The Normal setting enables you to freely drag a selection to any desired dimension.
 The Fixed Aspect Ratio option allows you to specify a ratio of width to height in a
selection. For example, if you enter 2 for width and 1 for height, you always get a
marquee selection that’s twice as wide as it is high, no matter what the size. A selec-
tion that’s 4 inches wide is automatically 2 inches high. You aren’t limited to whole
numbers, by the way; decimals are acceptable as well. This option is frequently used
to create vertically oriented images from horizontal video screen captures and
photos taken with digital cameras.
 And finally, select Fixed Size to specify exact values for the Width and Height. This
option comes in handy when several images need to be the same exact size, as in a
row of headshots of executives in a corporate brochure.

Width and Height: When you select a Fixed Size from the Style drop-down list, the
Width and Height text boxes are available for you to enter values.
Even though the default unit of measurement in the Width and Height text boxes is pixels
(px for short), you can enter any unit of measurement that Photoshop recognizes —
pixels, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, or percents. After the number,
simply type in the word or abbreviation of your desired unit of measurement. Photoshop
even lets you enter mixed units of measurements, so if you want a selection 100 pixels by
1.25 inches, you can do so.
Why would you do this? Who knows, but Photoshop allows you to. You’ll only use this
option if a selection must be a certain number of pixels wide, and even though you’re not
sure of the exact pixel measurement of the height, you’re guessing that it’s, say, 1.25 inches.
Photoshop CS has a new button (a double-headed arrow icon) between the Width and
Height fields. Click this button to swap the values between the Width and the Height.

Lassoing When You Can’t
Unfortunately, not much in life is rectangular or elliptical in shape. Most of the time, you have
to deal with irregular shapes with extrusions and protrusions (otherwise known as bumps or
bulges) of some sort or another. That’s where the lasso tools come in handy. This group of
tools allows you to make free-form selections.
Photoshop offers three lasso tools: the Lasso tool (which I call the regular Lasso to distinguish
it from the others), the Polygon Lasso tool, and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Each of the lasso
Anti-aliasing off

Lassoing When You Can’t

tools has its own special purpose in the realm of free-form selections. But in the category of
simplicity, they’re all almost as easy to use as the marquee tools. If you can drag with your
mouse, you’re qualified to handle any lasso tool. Just don’t indulge in too much caffeine. A
steady lasso hand is a good lasso hand.
To make a selection with the regular Lasso tool, all you have to do is drag around the part of the
image you want to select. The selection you make is only as good as how accurately you can
trace around your desired element. You need a steady hand — and a lot of practice — to
become a good Lasso tool user. But don’t fret; if you don’t make an exact selection the first time
around, you can always go back and make corrections (which I cover in Book III, Chapter 3).
If, when making a selection, you find yourself fighting with your mouse (and losing), you
may want to invest in a digital drawing tablet, such as a Wacom tablet. Using the stylus and
the tablet can make mastering tools such as the Lasso a whole lot easier.
The Lasso and the Polygon Lasso tools both have only two choices in the Options bar to
worry about — Feather and Anti-aliased. These options work exactly like they do with the
marquee tools. To find out more, check out the earlier section, “Using the marquee options.”
To make a selection by using the Lasso tool, here’s what you do:
Book
III
Chapter
1
1.
Select the Lasso tool from the Tools
palette. 
It’s the tool that looks like a rope. You
can also use the keyboard shortcut;
press the L key.
b Position the cursor somewhere on the
edge of the element that you want to
select.
The hot spot (the lead point) of the
lasso cursor is the end of the rope.
Where you start doesn’t really matter.
You may need to zoom in on the image a
bit if there isn’t a lot of contrast between
the element and the background. 
In my example, I started at the top of
the pitcher, as shown in Figure 1-7.
c Trace around the element, trying to
capture only what you want to retain
in your selection.
As you trace, a line forms that follows
the movement of your mouse.
Don’t release your mouse button until
you’ve completed the selection by
closing the loop or returning to the
starting point. 
When you release your mouse button,
Photoshop thinks you’re done and
closes the selection from where you
released the mouse button to your
starting point, as shown in Figure 1-8.
4.
Continue tracing until you return to
your starting point; release the mouse
button.
Recognizing that you’re now done,
Photoshop presents you with a selec-
tion marquee that matches your lasso
line (see Figure 1-9).

Selecting straight sides with the Polygon Lasso tool
Whereas the regular Lasso tool is great for selecting undulating, curvy elements, the Polygon
Lasso tool shines when it comes to the more regimented, straight-sided subjects, such as city
skylines, buildings, and stairways.
Unlike the regular Lasso tool, the Polygon Lasso tool has rubber-band-like qualities, and
instead of dragging, you click and release the mouse button at the corners of the object
you’re selecting. It’s like a digital connect the dots. Bonus: less manual dexterity required.
The following steps show you how to select with the Polygon Lasso tool:

Shift+L until you get the Polygon Lasso
tool. It looks like the regular Lasso tool,
but it has straight sides.

Attracting with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The newest member of the lasso tool trio is the Magnetic Lasso, which I admit can be kind of
tricky to use and sometimes even downright obstinate. The Magnetic Lasso tool works by ana-
lyzing the colors of the pixels between the elements in the foreground and the elements in the
background. Then it snaps to the edge between the elements, as if the edge had a magnetic pull.
The Magnetic Lasso tool performs best when your image has a lot of contrast between the
foreground and background elements — for example, a dark mountain range against a light
sky or a shadow against a stucco wall.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings, which you can adjust in the Options
bar, to tame its behavior. I cover those settings in the next section, “Adjusting the Magnetic
Lasso options.” For now, follow these steps to use the tool:

To close your selection, return to the
first point you clicked and click one
last time.
When you place your cursor over the
starting point, a small circle appears next
to your cursor, a sure sign that you’re at
the right place for closing the selection.
You can also double-click, and
Photoshop automatically closes the
selection from the point you double-
clicked to your starting point.
A selection marquee that matches your
Polygon Lasso line appears, as shown
in Figure 1-10.

Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from
the Toolbox.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut:
Press the L key and then press Shift+L

The tool looks like a straight-sided
lasso with a little magnet on it.

want to select.
You can start anywhere; just be sure to
click on the edge between the element
you want and the background you
don’t want.

c Move your cursor around the object,
without clicking.
The Magnetic Lasso tool creates a
selection line similar to the other Lasso
tools. It also adds little squares called
points along that selection line, as
shown in Figure 1-11. These points pin
down the selection line the way you
might section off an area of your yard
with ropes and stakes.
 If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts
veering off the edge of your object,
back up your mouse and click to
force a point down on the line.
 If the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a
point where you don’t want one,
simply press your Backspace
(Delete on a Mac) key to delete it.
4.
Continue moving your mouse around
the object; return to your starting
point and release the mouse button to
close the selection.
As with the Polygon Lasso tool, you
see a small circle next to your cursor
indicating that you’re at the correct
place to close the selection. If you
double-click, Photoshop closes the
selection from where you double-
clicked to your starting point. The
selection marquee appears when the
selection is closed.
Adjusting the Magnetic Lasso options
The Magnetic Lasso tool comes equipped with a few settings in the Options bar that control
the sensitivity of the tool (see Figure 1-12).
I recommend starting out by messing around with the Magnetic Lasso tool using its default
settings. If the tool isn’t cooperating, then play with the options.

The first icon has to do with Tool Presets, and the next four icons are the selection state icons
(check out Book III, Chapter 2). The Feather and Anti-aliased options work like they do with
the marquee tools (see the earlier section, “Using the marquee options”). The following list
explains the remaining options:

Width: This option, measured in pixels from 1 to 256, determines how close to the edge
you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic Lasso tool recognizes the object
you’re selecting.
Decrease the value if
 The object’s edge has a lot of indentations and protrusions.
 The image is of lower contrast.
Increase the value if
 The image is of higher contrast.
 The image has smoother edges.
When using the Magnetic Lasso tool, you can change the Width value from the key-
board by pressing the open bracket ( [ ) key to lower the value and the close bracket 
( ] ) key to increase the value.

Edge Contrast: Measured in percentages from 1 to 100, this option specifies the
required contrast between the object you’re selecting and its background before the
Magnetic Lasso tool hugs the edge between them. If your image has good contrast
between the foreground and background, use a higher percentage.

Frequency: This setting, measured in percentages from 1 to 100, specifies how many
points to place on the selection line. The higher the percentage, the greater number
of points.
 If the object you want to select has a fairly smooth edge, keep the percentage low.
Figure 1-12
Which tool do you use if you have an object with
both curves and straight sides? You can have
two, two, two tools in one! Press the Alt (Option
on the Mac) key to have the Polygon Lasso tool
temporarily transform into the regular Lasso tool.
Then drag to select the curves. Release the Alt
(Option) key to return to the Polygon Lasso tool.
And this trick works with the regular Lasso tool
as well. Press Alt (Option) to temporarily access
the Polygon Lasso tool. When you want the reg-
ular Lasso tool back again, just drag your mouse.
In this case, you can hold down the Alt (Option)
key; it makes no difference. If you want to release
the Alt (Option) key, just make sure that you’re
pressing down the mouse button; otherwise,
Photoshop will close the selection.
To temporarily change the Magnetic Lasso tool
into the Polygon Lasso tool, press the Alt (Option

Alt (Option) key, drag to get the regular Lasso
tool. When you want the Magnetic Lasso tool
back again, release the Alt (Option) key and
move your mouse without clicking.

Performing Wand Wizardry
The Magic Wand. The name is intriguing, isn’t it? Any tool that has the audacity to call itself
the Magic Wand must be so powerful that it can grant your every selection wish with a mere
swoosh. Unfortunately, it’s not quite so awe-inspiring. A better name for this tool would be the
Click-’n-Select tool. You click your image, and the Magic Wand tool makes a selection, which
contains areas of similar color, based on the color of the pixel you clicked.
Simple enough. What’s not quite so simple is how to determine how similar the color has to be
to get the Magic Wand tool to select it. That’s where the important Tolerance setting comes in.
Before you tackle tolerance (and find out how it affects the Magic Wand tool’s performance),
you first need to get the hang of using the Magic Wand tool.
Selecting with the Magic Wand tool
As with the Magnetic Lasso tool, the Magic Wand tool works best when you have high-contrast
images or images with a limited number of colors. As shown in Figure 1-13, a black-and-white
checkered flag is a perfect example of something that the Magic Wand tool effectively selects.
I click once on the top of a black square, and the Magic Wand tool picks up all the other sur-
rounding black pixels. I can now easily change the color of my black squares to red or yellow
in one fell swoop.

As you can see, Figure 1-14 is a poor candidate. This image contains a ton of colors and no real
definitive contrast between the scale and the background. Although it takes only one click to
select the black squares on the flag, other high-contrast candidates may take a few clicks. And
some images may need a tweak or two of the Tolerance setting, described in the next section.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Setting your Tolerance
Sometimes an image may contain a few shades of a similar color. Consider a cloudless sky for
example. A few shades of blue make up the bright blue yonder. With the Magic Wand tool, if
you click a darker shade of blue in the sky, Photoshop selects all similar shades of blue, but
the lighter shades remain unselected. This is usually a sure sign that you need to increase
your Tolerance level. The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand
tool selects.
Tolerance is based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255:

Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.

Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors — the entire image.
Figure 1-14

To use the Magic Wand tool and adjust Tolerance settings, follow these steps:
Book

Chapter

1.
Select the Magic Wand tool from the
Toolbox.
The Magic Wand tool looks like the
weapon of choice for many Disney
characters. You can also use the key-
board shortcut; press the W key.
2.
Click the portion of the image that
you want to select; use the default
Tolerance setting of 32.
The pixel that you click determines
the base color. The default value of 32
means that the Magic Wand tool selects
all colors that are 32 levels lighter and
32 levels darker than the base color.
If you selected everything you wanted
the first time you used the Magic Wand
tool, stretch your arm and give your-
self a pat on the back. If you didn’t
(which is probably the case), go to
Step 3.
3.
Enter a new Tolerance setting in the
Options bar.
If the Magic Wand tool selected more
than you wanted it to, lower the
Tolerance setting. If it didn’t select
enough, raise the setting.
4.
Click again on the portion of the
image that you want to select.
Changing the tolerance doesn’t adjust
your current selection.
The Magic Wand tool deselects the cur-
rent selection and makes a new selec-
tion based on your new Tolerance
setting, as shown in Figure 1-15. If it
still isn’t right, you can adjust the
Tolerance setting again. I regret that I
can’t give you a magic formula that you
can use to determine the right value.
It’s all about trial and error.

Using the Magic Wand Options bar
If you get a selection close to what you want, stop there and then use the selection-refining
techniques discussed in Book III, Chapter 2. But before you do that, you need to know about
the other Magic Wand settings in the Options bar. The three remaining options are as follows:

Contiguous: When you turn on this option, the Magic Wand tool selects only pixels that
are adjacent to each other. If you turn off the option, the Magic Wand tool looks
throughout the image and selects all pixels within the range of Tolerance, whether or
not they’re adjacent to each other.

Use All Layers: This option is valid only when you have multiple layers in your image.
(For more on layers, see Book V.) If you have multiple layers and this option is on, the
Magic Wand tool selects color from all visible layers. If you turn off this option, the
Magic Wand selects colors from the active layer only.

Sample Size: Although this option affects the Magic Wand tool, it appears in the
Options bar only when you’ve selected the Eyedropper tool. (For more on the
Eyedropper, see Book II, Chapter 3.) Select the Eyedropper tool and, in the Sample Size
pop-up menu that appears, choose from the following:
 Point Sample: Samples just the color of the pixel you clicked
 3 by 3 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and the surrounding 8
pixels
 5 by 5 Average: Averages the color of the pixel you clicked and the surrounding 24
pixels

A
lthough the Marquee, Lasso, and Magic Wand tools are
fun, friendly, and pretty easy to wield, sometimes they
don’t quite have the horsepower to make that really pre-
cise selection. So either you spend a lot of time cleaning up
what you’ve selected (see Book III, Chapter 3, for more on that
topic), or you live with a ho-hum selection. That’s where the
Pen tool and its related cronies come to the rescue. The Pen
tool creates paths, which you can then convert into selections.
Because the Pen tool (along with its related path-editing tools)
offers control and precision, it is very capable when it comes to
nailing that accurate selection. The only problem is that the
Pen tool is a far cry from fun, friendly, and easy. Getting the
hang of it can be tricky. Many new users try the Pen a few
times, but end up muttering in disgust and returning gratefully
to the Lasso tool. However, I guarantee that if you dedicate a
good chunk of time to mastering the Pen tool, you’ll soon turn
your elite little nose up at the simple Lasso tool.
Another added benefit of knowing how to use the Pen
tool is that it’s also the main drawing tool of Adobe
Illustrator. And similar tools exist in layout programs such
as Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress.
Introducing Paths
Unlike the other selection tools, the Pen tool doesn’t initially
produce a selection marquee. When you select the Pen tool and
start clicking and dragging around your image, you create a
path. Paths have three components — anchor points, straight
segments, and curved segments.
Curved paths are called Bézier paths (after Pierre Bézier who, in
the 1970s, invented the equation used for CAD/CAM programs),
which means that they are based on a mathematical cubic

equation where the path is controlled by direction lines that end in direction points (often
referred to as handles), as shown in Figure 2-1. The length and angle of direction lines control
the pitch and angle of the Bézier curve.
Figure 2-1 and the following list introduce all the different kinds of anchor points that
Photoshop puts at your disposal and show you exactly what they do. You can use some or all
of these anchor points in a single path:

A true corner point has no direction lines. Use corner points when selecting objects
with straight sides, such as stairs or barns.

A smooth point has two direction lines pointing in opposite directions but dependent
on one another. Use smooth points when selecting objects that have alternating curves,
such as a sea of rolling waves.

A cusp point has two direction lines that are independent of one another. Use cusp
points when selecting an object with curves going the same direction, such as the
petals on a daisy.

A point between a straight segment and a curve is a corner point with only one direc-
tion line.

Creating a Path with the Pen Tool

After you create a Bézier path, you can then edit the path by moving, adding, deleting, or con-
verting anchor points and by manipulating the direction lines. You can also transform paths
by choosing Edit➪Transform Paths (see Book III, Chapter 3, for details).
The path hovers over the image in its own space, and is controlled via the Paths palette where
you can save it, duplicate it, stroke it with color (apply color to the edge only), fill it with color
or a pattern, and most importantly, load it as a selection. I say “most importantly” because nine
times out of ten, you are going to painstakingly create a path as a means to an accurate selec-
tion marquee. There’s one other time you may use the path as a clipping path: to hide a part
of a layer or part of an entire image. I cover clipping paths in the last section of this chapter.
Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
The best way to get the hang of the Pen tool is to dive right in and work with it. You’ll want to
start with straight lines, which are very easy, and then move on to the more difficult curves.
The more you practice with the Pen, the more comfortable and proficient you’ll become. It
definitely is an example of the old adage “you get out what you put into it.”
Knowing your Pen tool options
Although every path consists of three basic components — segments, points, and direction
lines — the Pen tool enables you to use these components to create a few different types of
paths. See Book IV, Chapter 2, for more information on the following options, accessible from
the Pen tool’s Options bar. You must choose one of the following:

Shape Layers: This option creates a shape on a new layer that’s called, not surprisingly,
a shape layer. After you create the path that defines the shape, Photoshop fills the
shape with the foreground color and stores the path as a vector mask in the Paths
palette. A shape layer is a unique entity.

Fill Pixels: This option is available only when you’re using the Shape tools. It allows you
to create a shape and fill it with the foreground color, but it does not create a shape
layer nor does it retain the path.

Paths: This option enables you to create a traditional path that hovers over the image.
The path you create will be a work path, which is temporary, appears in the Paths
palette, and is unsaved. If you’re creating a path that will eventually be loaded as a
selection, this is your option.

Creating your first work path
Making a work path is the easiest of the three options, and you’ll use it frequently when
you’ve gotten the hang of using the Pen tool. The following steps show you how to create a
simple, straight path:

Rarely (if ever) will you create a work path that’s a single, straight line. Please keep reading
the other sections in this chapter.
1.
Open an image you want to practice
on.
I suggest choosing an image that has
an element with both straight edges
and curves, if you want to also practice
creating curved paths later.
2.
Select the Pen tool from the Toolbox
(more formally known as the Tools
palette).
Or you can just press the P key.
3.
In the Options bar, click the Paths
button.
You can see this button in Figure 2-2.
4.
To create a straight line, click and
release your mouse button at the
points where you want the line to
begin and to end, leaving anchor
points at those positions.
You don’t need to do any dragging to
create straight segments.
As you click and add your anchor
points, Photoshop creates straight seg-
ments that connect the anchor points,
as shown in Figure 2-3.
5.
To draw a constrained line — hori-
zontal, vertical, or 45° angle — hold
down the Shift key as you click.
6.
To end the path, click the Pen tool to
deselect it.
Or use this very handy shortcut: Hold
down the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac),
which gives you the Direct Selection
tool (the white arrow), and then click
away from the line. Release the Ctrl key
(Ô on the Mac), and the Pen tool
reappears.
When you’ve deselected the path,
you’re free to start another, uncon-
nected path if you need to.
Continue on to the following sections if
you want to add other kinds of seg-
ments to the path. Otherwise, skip to
“Closing a path,” later in this chapter.

Drawing curves
You’re probably never going to create a simple work path that doesn’t have curves as well as
straight lines. I mean, not much in life is perfectly linear. Most things have undulations here
and there. Picking up from the preceding section, here’s how to create curved paths:
Anchor
points
Straight
segment
Figure 2-3
Book

Chapter

1.
If you are adding onto a previously
created open path, make sure that
you position your cursor on the last
anchor point you created on that
open path to continue.
You see a slash mark or small square
appear next to your cursor. If you are
starting a new path, position the
cursor where you want the curve to
begin. 
In both cases, drag toward the direc-
tion that you want the bump of the
curve to go. Release the mouse button
when you’re done.
If you are creating a new path, an
anchor point along with two direction
lines, which have direction points at
their ends, appears. If you are adding a
curve to your straight segment, an
anchor point along with one direction
line and one direction point appears.
The direction lines and direction points
control the angle and pitch of the curve.

How do you know how far you should you
drag? You can do what I do and use the
rule of thirds. Imagine that your curve is a
piece of string that you have stretched and
laid out in a straight line. Divide that line
into thirds. The distance you drag your
mouse button is one-third the length of
that line.
How do you establish the angle? Drag
straight from the anchor point for a
steeper curve and at an angle from the
anchor point for a flatter curve. The ele-
ment in my example is a flatter curve;
therefore I dragged up and to the right at
an angle of about 4.5 degrees, as shown
in Figure 2-4.
2.
Move the cursor to the end of the
curve and drag in the opposite direc-
tion, away from the bump.
You now see another anchor point and
a set of two direction lines and points.
Photoshop creates the curve segment
between the anchor points, as shown
in Figure 2-5.
If you drag both direction lines in the
same direction, you create a curve shaped
like an S.
In the Options bar, click the down-pointing
arrow at the end of the row of tools and
choose the Rubber Band option. With this
option selected, Photoshop draws a seg-
ment between the last anchor point you
create and wherever your cursor is located,
giving you a kind of animated preview of
how the path will appear. I personally find
the option distracting, but some users
love it.
3.
To draw more alternating curves, just
repeat these steps, dragging in an
opposite direction each time.

Position your cursor over the second
anchor point in the existing curve and
press the Alt key (Option on the Mac).
You see a caret (which looks like an
upside down V ) next to the pen cursor.
Click and release your mouse button
over the anchor point.
The bottom direction line disappears.
You have converted a smooth point
into a corner point with one direction
line. This action will now allow you to
create a straight segment.
It’s no coincidence that the tool icon for
the Convert Point tool is also a caret.
Whenever you see a caret symbol in
Photoshop, it’s an indication that you are
converting an anchor point, from smooth
to corner or vice versa.
2.
Move your mouse to the end of the
straight edge you want to select and
click and release.
You can press the Shift key if you want
the line to be constrained horizontally,
vertically, or at an angle with a multiple
of 45 degrees.
Photoshop connects the two anchor
points with a straight segment, as
shown in Figure 2-6.

Connecting a straight segment to a curve segment
If you need to create a straight segment after creating a curve (or vice versa), you need to
convert the point where the path changes from curved to straight. To convert a point, follow
these steps:

Anchor

Connecting curve segments with cusp points
If you need to create a curve that goes in the same direction as a curve that is adjacent to it,
you need to take a couple additional steps:
Straight segment
Corner point with one direction line
Figure 2-6
1.
Convert the point — this time from
smooth to cusp — by positioning your
cursor over the second anchor point
in the existing curve and pressing the
Alt key (Option on the Mac).
2.
Drag toward the bump of the curve.
Release the mouse button and then
release the Alt (Option on the Mac)
key.
Essentially, your actions are pulling the
direction line out from the anchor
point. Both direction lines move to the
same side of the anchor point, yet are
independent of each other, creating the
cusp point, as shown in Figure 2-7.
3.
Move your cursor to where you want
the curve to end and drag away from
the bump to create your second
curve.
Try to keep anchor points on either side of
the curve, not along the top. It is also
good to try to use the fewest number of
anchor points possible to create your path.
That way, the path will result in a much
smoother curve. It will also create a
smaller file size and reduce the possibility
of printing problems. 
To draw a curve after a straight segment,
first position your cursor directly on the
last anchor point of the straight segment.
Drag toward the bump of the curve you
need to draw. A direction line appears.
Position your cursor where you want the
curve to end and drag away from the
bump.

Creating a Path with the Pen Tool
245
Closing a path
To close the path, return to your first anchor point and click. You see a small circle next to
your pen cursor, indicating that you will close the path when you click.
Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a work path (see Figure 2-8). Don’t worry if the
path isn’t perfect; you find out how to edit paths in an upcoming section. If your path is perfect
and you want to save it now, skip ahead to the section, “Working with the Paths Palette.”
If your path is incomplete and you need to continue drawing it, either click or drag on the
endpoint with the Pen tool. You will see the appearance of a slash mark or small square next
to the pen cursor.
Creating subpaths
You can also create a series of lines or curves. For example, you may want to create a border
consisting of some decorative curve shapes, which you could later stroke with color. You can
then save these subpaths under a single path name. To create a series of subpaths, simply end
one path before starting another. Make sure that the paths are not hidden when you do so;
otherwise, Photoshop will eliminate the previous path when you start another.
If working with the Pen tool feels awkward, difficult, and frustrating, don’t worry. Those are all
perfectly natural emotions to feel when you first use it. It took me months of grappling with it
before I could get to the point where I could use the tool without uttering several unmention-
able words. All I can say is keep practicing. Open up any images you have laying around on
your hard drive and select something. Before you know it, no image will be safe from the
prowess of your Pen.

Working with the Paths Palette
Working hand in hand with the Pen tool is the Paths palette. You can think of it as a kind of
Command and Control Center for your paths. Although it isn’t mandatory, it’s a good idea to
open up your Paths palette, shown in Figure 2-9, before you create a path so that you can stay
apprised as to what is happening with your image. To open the palette, choose Window➪Paths.
The icons at the bottom of the Paths palette from left to right, as shown in Figure 2-9, are

The following sections highlight some of the stuff you can do with the Paths palette.
Creating a path
When you create a path, it automatically appears in the Paths palette as a work path.
Remember that a work path is temporary and unsaved, and you can have only one work
path in the Paths palette at a time.
If the work path is selected when you begin another path, your actions are added to the cur-
rent work path. But if the existing work path is hidden and you begin drawing another path,
that new work path replaces the existing one.
Creating a new path
You can save yourself a lot of grief if you make sure that your path is saved before you start. If
you select New Path from the Paths palette pop-up menu before you create the path, Photoshop
automatically saves the work path, and it becomes a saved path or named path. You can also
just click the Create New Path icon (the dog-eared page icon) at the bottom of the Paths palette.
Saving a work path
To save a work path, double-click the path in the Paths palette. Or choose Save Path from the
Paths palette pop-up menu (click the triangle in the upper right to open the menu). Then pro-
vide a name in the Save Path dialog box and click OK.
After you save your path, you can reload it at any time. Unlike layers, paths take up very little
storage space, so don’t hesitate to save them. Plus, you don’t want to go through all that work
again if you don’t have to. Unlike work paths, you can have as many saved paths as your heart
desires.
Deleting, duplicating, and renaming a path
To delete a path, drag the path to the trash can icon at the bottom of the palette. Or choose
Delete Path from the Paths palette pop-up menu.
You can duplicate a saved path by choosing the path in the Paths palette and selecting
Duplicate Path from the Paths palette pop-up menu.
You can also drag the saved path on top of the Create New Path icon at the bottom of the
palette.
To rename a path, double-click the path name in the Paths palette. Then enter the new name
directly within the palette.

Stroking a path
You can use the Stroke path command to paint a stroke along the path. You can choose which
painting or editing tool to use to stroke the path. Follow these steps:
1.
Select the path in the Paths palette.
Then choose Stroke Path from the
Paths palette pop-up menu.
Or press the Alt key (Option on the
Mac) and click the Stroke Path with the
brush icon (an outlined circle) at the
bottom of the palette. You can also
click the Stroke Path icon without the
Alt (Option on the Mac) key. Note that
this option bypasses the dialog box in
Step 2 and just strokes your path with
whatever setting was used previously.
2.
In the dialog box that opens, choose
one of the 15 painting or editing tools
you want to use to apply color to the
stroke. Click OK.
Make sure that you verify your chosen
tool’s settings in the Options bar because
Photoshop uses those settings to stroke
your path. Photoshop will also apply your
current foreground color to the stroke.
If you’re using a pressure-sensitive
drawing tablet, you can select the
Simulate Pressure check box to create
strokes with varying widths. If every-
thing has gone well, you should end up
with a stroked path (see Figure 2-10).
If you select one or more paths with
the Direct Selection tool, the Stroke Path
command changes to Stroke Subpath(s),
enabling you to stroke only the selected
paths.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Filling a path
You can fill the interior of a path with color by choosing the Fill Path command. Follow these
steps:
Figure 2-10

1.
Select the path in the Paths palette
and choose Fill Path from the Paths
palette pop-up menu.
A dialog box gives options for Contents,
Opacity, Blending, and Rendering. (For
more on the Contents and Opacity
options, see Book IV, Chapter 3.)
Or you can press the Alt key (Option
on the Mac) and click the Fill Path with
Foreground Color icon (a solid circle)
at the bottom of the palette. You can
also click the Fill icon without the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key. This option
bypasses the dialog box and just fills
your path with whatever setting was
used previously.
2.
In the dialog box, leave the Blending
Mode option set to Normal.
It’s better to use the Layers palette to
apply your blend modes because you
have more flexibility (see Book V for
more on layers). Here is the scoop on
the remaining options:
 The feathering option gradually
blurs the edges of the fill into the
background. Enter the feather
radius in pixels. The more pixels,
the greater the blur or feather.
 The anti-aliased option just slightly
softens the very edge of the fill so it
doesn’t appear as ragged.
If you select one or more paths with the
Direct Selection tool, the Fill Path com-
mand changes to Fill Subpath(s), enabling
you to fill only the selected paths.
3.
After you set your options, click OK.
Your path should now be filled like
mine, as shown in Figure 2-11.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Loading Paths as Selections
Creating a path is usually the means to an end — an accurate selection. Therefore, most likely,
you will frequently be using the Paths palette to load your path as a selection.
Figure 2-11

▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼

Book III  Chapter 2: Creating and Working with Paths
250
Follow these steps to get the lowdown on how to do just that. Open an image, make a selec-
tion by using the Pen tool, and get started.
1.
Choose Make Selection from the Paths
palette pop-up menu.
Alternatively, you can also press Alt
(Option on the Mac) and click the Load
Path as a Selection icon in the Paths
palette. To bypass the Make Selection
dialog box, simply click the Load Path
as a Selection icon at the bottom of the
Paths palette.
b In the Make Selection dialog box,
shown in Figure 2-12, you can
 Feather your selection by entering a
pixel value in the Feather Radius
box. (For more on feathering, see
Book III, Chapter 3.)
 Leave the feather radius at 0 for a
hard-edged selection.
 Select the Anti-aliased option. This
option slightly softens the edge of
the selection so that it doesn’t
appear so jagged. (It’s my personal
recommendation.)
If you happen to have another selec-
tion active when you load your current
path as a selection, you can choose to
add, subtract, or intersect with that
other selection.
After the path is made into a selection,
it acts like any other selection.
If you need a selection refresher, see
Book III, Chapter 1. If you want to save
your selection, jump ahead to Book VI,
Chapter 1.
Here’s one of my favorite shortcuts. To
quickly load the path as a selection, select
the path and then press Ctrl+Enter
(Ô+Return on the Mac). You can also
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) on your
path name in the Paths palette to do the
same. Just be aware that you bypass the
dialog box and its options when you use
the shortcuts.

Making a Selection into a Path
Although you probably won’t use this option nearly as often as you use the option to turn
a path into a selection, the option is, indeed, available: You can create paths from existing
selections.
Creating a path from a selection can come in handy if you need to save a path as a clipping
path (described in the last section of this chapter).
Book
III
Chapter
2
1.
If you’ve been reading from the
beginning of this chapter, you proba-
bly have a selection on-screen ready
and raring to go. If you are just jump-
ing in, go ahead and select the
desired element in your image.
2.
With the selection marquee active,
select Make Work Path from the Paths
palette pop-up menu.
3.
In the dialog box that appears, enter a
Tolerance value.
You can also create a path from a selec-
tion by pressing Alt (Option on the Mac)
and clicking the Make Work Path from
Selection icon in the Paths palette. If you
just click the icon, you also make a path,
but you bypass the dialog box.
The Tolerance number controls how
sensitive Photoshop is to the nooks
and crannies in the selection marquee
when it creates the path:
 The lower the value, the more sensi-
tive it is, and the better it approxi-
mates your selection.
 Too low a value, such as 0.5, may
create too many anchor points.
 Too high a value, such as 10, rounds
out your path too much. Start with
the default setting of 2.0.
You can always tweak the path later
(check out “Editing Paths” later in this
chapter).
4.
If the path is still showing after you
load your selection marquee, simply
click in the gray area below the path
names in the Paths palette.
This action deselects the path and
leaves you with just the selection
marquee.
5.
Select the work path in the Paths
palette and choose Save Path from
the Paths palette pop-up menu. Name
the path and click OK.
Using the Kinder Freeform Pen
Confession: There is a more amicable incarnation of the Pen tool — the Freeform Pen tool.
This tool is kind of a hybrid Lasso/Pen tool. Just drag around the element you want to select,
and the tool creates an outline that follows your cursor, exactly like the Lasso, as shown in
Figure 2-13.
After you release your mouse button, Photoshop provides the anchor points, lines, and
curves for that path, exactly like the Pen.
In my humble opinion, the Freeform Pen rates just an okay. The downside is that you are back
to having to have a really steady hand in order to get an accurate selection. The tool is proba-
bly one notch better than the Lasso tool because you do get a path that you can refine before
you load it as a selection. But I’d rather pay my dues and get skilled with the regular Pen.

Book III  Chapter 2: Creating and Working with Paths
252
Here are some Freeform Pen tips:

To create straight segments with the Freeform Pen, press Alt (Option on the Mac) while
the mouse button is pressed down and then click to create the anchor point.

Pressing Alt (Option on the Mac) temporarily turns the Freeform Pen into the regular
Pen. When you want to return to drawing curves, release Alt (Option on the Mac),
keeping the mouse button pressed down.
Be careful: If you release Alt (Option on the Mac) while the mouse button is not pressed
down, Photoshop ends your path, and there’s nothing you can do about it.
The following sections give you the scoop on the options that go hand in hand with the
Freeform Pen tool.
Curve Fit
The Curve Fit option lets you adjust the amount of error Photoshop allows when trying to fit
your cursor movement to a path. You can enter a value from 0.5 to 10 pixels; the default set-
ting is 2 pixels.
At the default setting, Photoshop doesn’t register any movement of your cursor that is 2
pixels or less. Setting the value to 0.5 pixels makes the Freeform Pen very sensitive to your
movement and forces the tool to very closely follow the edge.
The disadvantage of this option is that using it also causes a lot of unnecessary anchor points.
Although a value of 10 pixels corrects this problem by making the option less sensitive, your
path may not be as accurate.
Figure 2-13

Creating Paths without the Pen
253
I recommend trying the Freeform Pen at each of these settings and then getting a feel for
the kind of path it makes.
Magnetic
When selected, the Magnetic option makes the Freeform Pen act much like the Magnetic Lasso
tool. Click anywhere on the edge of the element you want to select. Release your mouse
button and then move the cursor around the edge. The tool snaps to the edge of your ele-
ment, creating anchor points and segments. You can

Manually control the magnetism: If the Freeform Pen tool starts to veer off course, you
can manually force down an anchor point by clicking.

Create straight segments: To create straight segments, again press Alt (Option on the
Mac) and click (you temporarily get the regular Pen). Alt+drag (Option+drag on the Mac)
to temporarily access the regular Freeform Pen. To return to the magnetic Freeform Pen
tool, release Alt (Option on the Mac), click again, and continue moving the cursor.
To close a path with the magnetic Freeform Pen, you must double-click.
Width, Contrast, Frequency, and Pen Pressure
The Width, Contrast, and Frequency settings are specifically for the Magnetic option and work
just like the Magnetic Lasso options. Width specifies how close to the edge (1–256) the tool
must be before it detects an edge. Contrast (1–100) specifies how much contrast there must
be between pixels for the tool to see the edge. And Frequency (5–40) specifies the rate at
which the tool lays down anchor points. For more details, see Book III, Chapter 1.
The Pen Pressure option is available only if you’re using a pressure-sensitive drawing
tablet and allows you to adjust how sensitive the tool is based on how hard you press down
with the stylus.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Creating Paths without the Pen
I want to let you in on a fun way to create paths. Yes, I said fun. You have to assume by fun I
mean there is no Pen tool involved in the method.
You can grab any of the shape tools and create a work path. Before you do, however, be sure
to click the Paths icon in the Options bar. It’s the icon that looks like a pen cursor with a
square path around it. Drag the shape tool of choice on your canvas and presto, an instant
path. These shapes can come in handy for creating small spot illustrations, logos, and Web
buttons.

Follow these steps:
1.
Open an existing image and select a

In the example shown in Figure 2-14,
I used the Custom Shape tool.
2.
Choose a shape from the shape preset
library and open an image.
I chose a fish shape.

Editing Paths
Often, it is easier and less time consuming to try to get a reasonably decent, but not perfect
path with the Pen tool. Then after you’ve got that, go back and edit your path for more accu-
racy. And while following the Eyeball-It-Then-Fix-It strategy is valuable any time in your
Photoshop career, it is especially true when you’re first learning to use the Pen tool.
Photoshop offers you a bevy of editing tools that can make your path repair a snap. These tools
even share the same flyout menu as the Pen tool. In addition, the arrow tools, which Adobe calls
the Path Selection and Direct Selection tools, are also extremely helpful when it comes to fine-
tuning your path. In fact, you may find, like I do, that the Direct Selection tool is one of your
favorite tools — so simple to use, yet so functional. Figure 2-16 shows both sets of tools.

If you want, add some type with the
Type tool.
If you want to give your type some
motion, click the Create Warped Text
button in the Options bar. You can also
apply drop shadows, bevels, and other
effects by choosing Layer➪Layer Style.
I chose the Flag style warp in the Warp
Text dialog box.
I also applied a Bevel and Emboss and
Drop Shadow Layer Style to both the
selection and the type. (For more on
type, see Book IV, Chapter 4.)

If you can’t see the path you want to
edit, select the path in the Paths
palette.
This activates the path.
2.
To see the individual anchor points so
that you can edit them, select the
Direct Selection tool (remember, it’s
the white arrow). Click anywhere
along the path.
You should now see the individual
anchor points and segments that
comprise the path. Most of the anchor
points, if not all, will be hollow because
they are unselected, as shown in
Figure 2-17.
3.
If you need to move an anchor point,
click it with the Direct Selection tool.
When selected, the point becomes
solid, also shown in Figure 2-17. Drag
to move the anchor point. If you need
to, you can move a curved or straight
segment in the same fashion.
4.
If you’re in need of some major repair
and need to move an entire path, use
the Path Selection tool (the black
arrow).
You can also select multiple paths by
pressing the Shift key while clicking
the paths.
If you move any part of the path beyond
the boundary of the image canvas, it is
still available — just not visible. Use the
Zoom tool to zoom out until you see the
hidden portion of the path.
To edit a path, follow these steps:

Manipulate the direction lines to
change the shape of the curve. First,
click the anchor point of the curve to
select it. Then click and drag the
direction point going the same direc-
tion as the bump.
By lengthening or shortening the direc-
tion line, you can control how steep or
flat the curve is. By rotating the direc-
tion line, you change the slope of the
curve, as shown in Figure 2-18.
 To add an anchor point in your path,
use the Add Anchor Point tool. Click
in the path where you need an anchor
point. This tool always adds a smooth
point, no matter where you click.
 To delete an anchor point, select the
Delete Anchor Point tool, position
the cursor over the anchor point
you no longer need, and click it. The
anchor point disappears while keep-
ing your path intact.
 To convert an anchor point from
smooth to corner or vice versa,
select the Convert Point tool.
Position your cursor on your desired
anchor point. If the anchor point is a
corner point, drag away from the
anchor point to create the direction
lines that create a smooth point. If
the point is a smooth point, simply
click and release on the anchor point
to convert it into a corner point. To
convert a smooth point to a cusp
point, make sure the direction lines
are showing and then drag a direc-
tion line to break it into independent
direction lines. And finally, to con-
vert a cusp point back to a smooth
point, just drag out from the anchor
point.
 To copy a path, first select it with the
Path Selection tool. Then press Alt
(Option on the Mac) and drag away
from the path. As you drag, you will
carry a copied path with you, while
leaving the original path intact. Note
that you can drag a copied path onto
another image window as well as
within the same image.
 To delete a path, select the path
with the Path Selection tool and
press the Backspace key (Delete key
on the Mac). You can also select a
point on the path with the Direct
Selection tool and press Backspace
(Delete on the Mac) twice.

Book III  Chapter 2: Creating and Working with Paths
258
Using the Options Bar
Quite a few options appear in the Options bar when the Pen tools or Path Selection/Direct
Selection tools are active. Here is the scoop on those options:

The Auto Add/Delete option enables you to add or delete an anchor point with the reg-
ular Pen tool.

Show Bounding Box places a box around the path, allowing you to transform the
path. The bounding box isn’t a path or part of your image. It is merely a visual guide to
assist you in transformations. You can scale it by dragging the handles or rotate it by
dragging just outside the box. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and drag a handle or side to
distort or skew the path. For more on transformations, see Book III, Chapter 3.

The path state buttons (add, subtract, intersect, and exclude) combine all visible paths
by adding, subtracting, intersecting, or excluding paths. Click your desired button to
direct Photoshop on how to control the overlapping portions of the path(s) when you
convert it to a selection. For example, clicking the Add button selects all areas whether
or not they overlap. Clicking Intersect selects only the overlapping areas.

The align and distribute buttons align two or more paths and distribute three or more
paths. The icons give you a good visual cue as to how the alignment or distribution will
appear.

Clipping Out the Unwanted
259
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Clipping Out the Unwanted
A clipping path hides areas that fall outside your path and displays the area inside your path.
For example, without a clipping path, if you were to import a silhouetted image into Microsoft
Word or an older page layout program or illustration program that doesn’t support trans-
parency and place it against a colored background, it would appear against a rectangular
white background, as shown in Figure 2-19. This occurs whether or not the background was
transparent in Photoshop. This is because the image must be flattened before it can be
imported and therefore loses any transparency. (For more on flattening, see Book V.)
With the advent of more sophisticated page layout and illustration programs, such as the
latest versions of InDesign, PageMaker, QuarkXPress, and Illustrator, the need for clipping
paths has pretty much lost its urgency. That’s because these programs all support TIFFs
with transparency. (For more on working with Photoshop and other programs, see Book X,
Chapter 1.) But just in case you’re using older or less sophisticated software and you need to
use a clipping path, here’s what you need to do:
Because an overabundance of complex clipping paths can cause printing problems, I recom-
mend using clipping paths as a last resort. Even if your illustration or page layout program
doesn’t support transparency, you can always composite your elements in Photoshop. For
more on layers and creating composites, see Book V.

Create your path by using the Pen tool.
A work path appears in the Paths

Save the path by choosing Save Path

Immediately return to the pop-up

In the dialog box, choose the path
name from the Path drop-down list.
4.
Leave the flatness value blank. If it is
blank, the default value of the output
device (printer, image setter and so
on) will be used. And usually the
default value is a good number for the
particular printer used.
Briefly, flatness represents how closely
your curves approximate a true mathe-
matical curve. A higher value causes
more of a polygon shape (albeit often
not noticeable by the eye), but results
in easier printing.
5.
Choose File➪Save and choose a file
format from the Format drop-down
list.
I like the Photoshop EPS format,
personally.
Some programs, such as the latest ver-
sions of InDesign, PageMaker, and
QuarkXPress, will also accept TIFFs
with clipping paths. In addition, you
can save the file as a JPEG, PDF, DCS,
and in the native Photoshop format
from Windows. And the Mac will let
you save the file in any available format.
Because most of my page layout files
are ultimately offset printed, I stick
with EPS. EPS is the preferred file
format for color separations (see Book
X, Chapter 2) necessary for offset print
jobs.

Your clipping path is now in place, and
you can import the silhouetted image
into the desired program.
Occasionally, when you import an
image with a clipping path into certain
page layout programs on the PC, the
screen preview may not display the
image correctly. The clipped, or hidden
portion, of the image may appear
opaque (solid white or black) on-
screen. But it should print okay on a
PostScript printer. You may not be so
lucky if you use a non-PostScript
printer.

I
f you’re like me, you may find it tough to get the perfect
selection the first time around. I mean, all it takes is one too
many cups of coffee, and that Lasso tool seems to take on a
mind of its own. That’s okay. Photoshop is way too benevolent
to leave you hanging with a mediocre selection. A multitude of
techniques are available to modify and transform your selec-
tions. You can add or remove pixels from your selection, scale
your selection outline, smooth out jagged edges, or switch
what is selected for what isn’t. Knowing how to clean up and
modify your selections helps you to nail your desired element
with precision.
If you haven’t already thumbed through the first two chapters
of Book III and gotten a good grasp of how to create selections
by using the mighty Photoshop Toolbox (more formally known
as the Tools palette), go ahead and browse those chapters now.
Achieving Selection Perfection
Although the selection tools, such as the Lasso and Magic Wand,
usually do a pretty fair job at capturing the bulk of your selec-
tion, making a really accurate selection often requires another
sort of tool — concentration. Give your selections a little extra
attention, and you’ll be amazed by the results. By adding and
subtracting from the outline here and there, you can refine a
selection and ensure that you capture only what you really
want — and nothing that you don’t.
The following few sections show you how to use keyboard
shortcuts, along with your mouse, to make perfect selections.
If you’re not one for keyboard shortcuts, you can use the four
selection option buttons in the Options bar, shown in Figure 3-1,

to create a new selection, add to a selection, subtract from a selection, or intersect one selec-
tion with another. All you need to do is grab the selection tool of your choice, click the selec-
tion option button you want, and drag (or click if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygon
Lasso tool).
When adding to a selection, a small plus sign appears next to your cursor. When subtracting
from a selection, a small minus sign appears. When intersecting two selections, a small multi-
plication sign appears. 
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Adding to a selection
To add to a current selection, simply press the Shift key and drag around the pixels you want
to include with the regular Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. You can also
press the Shift key and click the area you want with the Magic Wand tool. 
To include an area with straight sides in your selection, you can press the Shift key and click
around the area with the Polygon Lasso tool. And although you may not have much need to
do it, you can also press the Shift key and click with the Single Column or Single Row Marquee
tool. I wouldn’t use the Magnetic Lasso tool to add to a selection; it’s way too cumbersome.
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used to create the
original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you think will get the job done.
See Book III, Chapters 1 and 2 for details on selection tools and methods.
Here are the steps to use for adding to a circular selection:

To add the smaller circular area, first
press the Shift key and then press the

Drag around the smaller selection
with the Elliptical Marquee tool.
The resulting selection is shown in the
example on the right in Figure 3-2.

Subtracting from a selection
Just as you can add to a selection marquee, you can also subtract, or deselect, from the selec-
tion. To subtract from a current selection, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and drag
around the pixels you want to subtract with the regular Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical
Marquee tool. 
Press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the area you want to remove with the Magic
Wand tool. 
To subtract a straight-sided area, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click around the
area with the Polygon Lasso tool.
You can press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click with the Single Column or Single Row
Marquee tool. The Single Column and Row Marquee tools come in handy when you want to
get rid of just the very edge of a selection.
In the top example of Figure 3-3, I first selected the frame with the Polygon Lasso tool. I didn’t
use the obvious tool of choice — the Rectangular Marquee tool — because the frame was not
completely straight. To deselect the inside of the frame from the selection, I pressed the Alt
key (Option on the Mac) and clicked at each corner of the inside of the frame with the
Polygon Lasso tool, resulting in the selection shown in the bottom example of Figure 3-3.

What happens when you press the Shift and Alt (Option on the Mac) keys together? Not a col-
lision, but an intersection. Pressing both keys while dragging with a Lasso or Marquee tool or
clicking with the Magic Wand tool creates the intersection of the original selection with the
second selection. 
To retain only the part of an image where two selections overlap, press Shift and Alt (or Shift
and Option on the Mac) and then drag.
You can select a portion of an image with a tool such as the Polygon Lasso tool. (In Figure 3-4,
I selected the top-right portion of the framed photo.) Then press the Shift and Alt (Option on
the Mac) keys at the same time and drag with the Rectangular Marquee tool. (I selected the
lower-left portion of the image.) The resulting intersection of the two selections appears in
the bottom example of Figure 3-4.

Getting the Keys to Behave
Photoshop has a little glitch in its way of doing things. Well, not so much of a glitch as a con-
flict. With so many ways of doing things with Photoshop, it’s no wonder that somewhere along
the line you have to jigger with Photoshop to get it to do what you want. For example, how
does Photoshop know whether you want to create a perfect square or add to a selection when
you press the Shift key?

Let me lay this out for you:

When you make an initial selection with the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool,
pressing the Shift key constrains the proportions of the selection, thereby allowing you
to create a perfect square or a perfect circle. 

If you press Alt (Option on the Mac) with either of these tools, you can draw from the
center out. 

If you press Alt (Option on the Mac) with the Lasso tool, the Lasso temporarily
becomes the Polygon Lasso tool.
Unfortunately, despite numerous requests, the ability to read users’ minds wasn’t a Version CS
upgrade feature. The following sections show you what you have to do to get Photoshop to
recognize your wishes.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Adding a perfectly square or circular selection
To add a perfectly square or round selection to an existing selection, follow these steps:
1.
Press Shift and drag with the
Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee
tool.
Your selection is unconstrained. 
2.
As you drag, keeping your mouse
button pressed down, release the
Shift key for just a moment, and then
press it down again.
Your unconstrained selection suddenly
snaps into a constrained square or
circle. 
3.
Release the mouse button before you
release the Shift key. 
If you don’t release the mouse button
before you release the Shift key, the selec-
tion shape will revert back to its uncon-
strained form.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Deleting from an existing selection while drawing from the center out
To delete part of a selection while drawing from the center out, follow these steps:
1.
Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and
drag with the Rectangular or Elliptical
Marquee tool. 
2.
As you drag, keeping your mouse
button pressed down, release the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key for just a
moment, and then press it down
again. 
You are now drawing from the center
outward. 
3.
Release the mouse button before you
release the Alt (Option on the Mac)
key.
See Figure 3-5.
Use this technique when you’re selecting
a doughnut, tire, inflatable swim ring, and
other circular items with holes in the
middle.

Using the Select Menu
267
Using the Select Menu
Although you can add, subtract, and intersect selections with the Shift and Alt (Option on the
Mac) keys and the selection option buttons in the Options bar, you can do much more with
the commands found on the Select menu, shown in Figure 3-6. Here you’ll find ways to expand,
contract, smooth, fuzz, and turn your selection inside out. You can also use this menu to auto-
matically select similar colors and create selection borders. And I show you how to do this in
the next few sections. With this kind of knowledge, imperfect selections will soon be a thing of
the past.

Selecting All or Nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands are pretty self-explanatory. To select everything in
your image, choose Select➪All. To deselect everything, choose Select➪Deselect. The key com-
mands Ctrl+A (Ô+A on the Mac) and Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac), respectively, come in very
handy and are easy to remember. 
In most cases, you don’t have to select everything in your image. If you don’t have an active
selection marquee, Photoshop naturally assumes that whatever command you execute
should be applied to the entire image.
Reselecting a selection
If you have taken 20 minutes to carefully lasso a spiny sea anemone from its ocean home, the
last thing you want to have happen is to lose your coveted selection marquee. But that is
exactly what happens if you accidentally click on the canvas when you have an active selec-
tion tool in hand. The selection marquee disappears.
Sure, you can choose Edit➪Undo if you catch your mistake right away. And technically, you
could access the History palette to recover your selection (see Book II, Chapter 4, for more on
history). A much easier solution is to choose Select➪Reselect. This command retrieves your
last selection. 
Besides immediately bringing back a selection you accidentally deselected, the Reselect com-
mand can come in handy if you decide to select an element again for a second time. For exam-
ple, if you do such a great job retouching your spiny anemone that you decide to add, by
cloning, another anemone to your image, go ahead. It’s all up to you. By using the Reselect
command, you can easily load the selection again rather than start the selection from scratch.
The Reselect command only works for the last selection you made, so don’t go planning to
reselect a selection you made last week — or even ten minutes ago — if you’ve selected
something else in the meantime.
Swapping a selection
Sometimes it’s easier for you to select what you don’t want than it is to select what you do.
For example, if you’re trying to select your pet dog, photographed against a neutral back-
ground, why spend valuable time meticulously selecting him with the Pen or Lasso tool, when
If you have an existing selection, pressing Alt
(Option on the Mac) with the Lasso tool subtracts
from the selection. If you want to subtract a
straight-sided selection from an existing selec-
tion, you can press Alt (Option on the Mac) and
begin to drag. Then quickly release Alt (Option on
the Mac) and then select the Polygon Lasso tool.
But this can be tricky and is really unnecessary. I
recommend just grabbing the Polygon Lasso tool
itself to delete your straight-sided selection. Ditto
for adding and getting intersections with straight-
sided selections.
Deleting a straight-sided selection

Selecting All or Nothing

you can just click the background with the Magic Wand tool? (Don’t forget to use the Shift key
to select bits of background you might have missed the first time.) 
After you’ve selected the background, just choose Select➪Inverse. Presto, you now have Fido
the Retriever selected and obediently awaiting your next command, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Feathering a selection
In Book III, Chapter 1, I described how to feather (blur the edges) a selection when using the
Lasso and Marquee tools by entering a value in the Feather box in the Options bar. This method
of feathering requires that you set your Feather radius before you create your selection. 
Unfortunately, using this method, a problem arises if you want to modify the initial selection.
When you make a selection with a feather, the marquee outline of the selection adjusts to take
into account the amount of the feather. That means that the resulting marquee outline doesn’t
resemble your precise mouse movement. As a result, modifying, adding, or subtracting from
your original selection is pretty tough. 
A much better way to feather a selection is to make your initial selection without a feather, as
shown in top image of Figure 3-8. Clean up your selection as you need to, and then apply your
feather by choosing Select➪Feather. Enter a Feather Radius value and click OK. The resulting
selection appears in the bottom image of Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-7
Book
III
Chapter
3

Book III  Chapter 3: Modifying and Transforming Selections and Paths
270
The radius is how far out in all directions the feather extends. A radius of 8 means the
feather extends 8 pixels to the right, left, up, and down from the selection outline. A large
feather radius makes the image appear to fade out.
Using the Modify commands
The Select Modify menu contains a group of modification commands that are lumped categor-
ically. With the exception of the Contract command, you probably won’t use these options
every day. But when you do use them, you’ll find that they prove useful. Here is the lowdown
on each command:

Border: This command selects the area around the edge of the selection marquee. You
specify the width of the area, from 1 to 200 pixels, and you get a border marquee, like
Original

Marquee after
feathering
75 pixels
Figure 3-8

Selecting All or Nothing
271
the one shown in the example on the left in Figure 3-9. Choose a foreground color,
choose Edit➪Fill, pick Foreground Color from the Use drop-down list, and then click OK
to fill your border with color, as shown in the example on the right in Figure 3-9. By the
way, you can also achieve a similar look by using the Edit➪Stroke command.
As you can see in Figure 3-9, the Border command creates an anti-aliased (or soft-edged)
selection. On the other hand, the Stroke command, on the Edit menu, creates a hard-edged
selection.

Smooth: If your selection marquee seems a bit ragged around the edges, try selecting
the Smooth command to round off the nooks and crannies. Enter a sample radius value
from 1 to 100 pixels. Photoshop examines each selected pixel and then includes or de-
selects pixels in your selection based on the range specified by the radius amount. If
most of the pixels are selected, Photoshop includes the strays; if most of the pixels are
unselected, Photoshop removes the pixels. Start with 2 pixels and, if that doesn’t seem
like enough, increase it by a few more pixels or so. 
Use this command with great caution and a steady hand. The results can be mushy, ill-
defined selections.

Expand: This command allows you to increase the size of your selection by a specified
number of pixels, from 1 to 100. This can come in handy if you just missed the edge of a
circular selection and want to enlarge it, as shown in Figure 3-10.

Contract: To shrink your selection by 1 to 100 pixels, choose Contract. I use this com-
mand a lot, in conjunction with the Feather command, when compositing multiple images.
Figure 3-9
Book
III
Chapter

Book III  Chapter 3: Modifying and Transforming Selections and Paths
272
After you make a selection, contract it and then feather it before you drag it onto the canvas.
This technique helps to create a nice, natural-looking transition between the various images
in your composite. The amount you decide to contract and feather varies according to the
resolution of your images. For example, if you’re using low-resolution (72 dpi) images, you
may want to use 1 pixel for the Contract amount and 0.5 pixels for the Feather amount;
higher resolution images may warrant 2 to 3 pixels for the Contract amount and 1 to 2
pixels for the Feather amount. (For more on compositing images, see Book V on layers.)
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are close cousins to the Magic Wand tool. (For more on the
Wand and Tolerance, check out Book III, Chapter 1.) If you’re familiar with the modus operandi
Figure 3-10

Moving and Cloning Selections
273
of the Magic Wand tool, you know that you rarely get the perfect selection on the first click.
That’s because you are making an intelligent guess as to what Tolerance setting will pick up
the pixels you want.
The Grow command compensates a little for the Magic Wand tool’s inaccuracy. For example, if
you need to include more in your selection, you can increase the Tolerance setting and try
again — press Shift and click the area you need to include. Or you can choose Select➪Grow.
The Grow command increases the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall
within the range of Tolerance. 
The Similar command is like Grow, only the pixels don’t have to be adjacent to be selected.
The command searches throughout the image and picks up pixels within the Tolerance range,
wherever they may fall.
Both commands use the Tolerance value that is displayed in the Options bar when you have
the Magic Wand tool selected. Adjust the Tolerance setting, to include more or fewer colors
by increasing or decreasing the setting, respectively.
Moving and Cloning Selections
When you have your selection refined to the ultimate in perfection, you may then want to
move it or clone it. To move a selection, simply grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) at
the top right of the Tool palette, and then drag the selection. 
Sounds easy enough, right? When you move the selection, however, be warned that the area
where the selection used to reside is now filled with the background color, as shown in Figure
3-11. This is provided, of course, that you are moving both the selection outline and the image
pixels. You can move just the selection outline (without the pixels), as I explain in an upcom-
ing section. Also note that if you are moving a selection on a layer, you are left with transpar-
ent pixels. When you use the Move tool, your cursor icon changes to a pair of scissors, letting
you know that you are cutting out the selection.
Figure 3-11

III

Book III  Chapter 3: Modifying and Transforming Selections and Paths
274
Cloning
If the idea of leaving a big hole in your image doesn’t appeal to you, you can copy and move
the selection, leaving the original image intact. Just press Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag
with the Move tool. This action is often referred to as cloning because you’re essentially
making a duplicate of a selected area and then moving that duplicate elsewhere. 
When cloning, your cursor icon changes to a double-headed arrow, notifying you that you are
duplicating the selection. If you want to move your selection in small increments (1 pixel),
press your arrow keys while you have the Move tool selected. Press Shift along with an arrow
key to move 10 pixels. And of course, adding the Alt (Option on the Mac) key to the key com-
mands allows you to clone a selection while you move it.
You can temporarily access the Move tool by pressing the Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) key when you
have any tool selected, except for the Hand tool, Pen tools, Slice tools, Path Selection tool,
Direct Selection tool, and Shape tools. Likewise, press Alt along with Ctrl with any of these
tools to clone and move a selection.
Moving the selection outline, but not the pixels
If all you want to do is move the selection marquee without moving the pixels underneath,
you want to avoid using the Move tool. Instead, grab any selection tool — the marquee tools,
the lasso tools, or the Magic Wand tool — and then click inside the marquee and just drag.
That way you move only the outline of the element, not the element itself. You can also use
the arrow keys to nudge a selection marquee.

Transforming Pixels
Although you may consider the distortions on the Transform menu somewhat mundane when
compared to the fun and flashy Liquify command (described in Book VII, Chapter 3), I’m sure
you’ll find them a lot more practical and useful in your daily digital-imaging chores.
You can move and clone selections within a single
image or among multiple images. To move a
selection from one image to another, choose
Edit➪Cut, activate the second image, and choose
Edit➪Paste. To clone a selection, simply drag the
selection with the Move tool from one image
window and drop it onto another image window.
The original image stays intact. To clone a selec-
tion marquee, drag the marquee with any selec-
tion tool from one image window to another. 
For more on dragging and dropping selections,
see the Putting-It-Together sections on creating
a digital collage, which run throughout Book V.

Transforming Pixels
275
Here’s how to transform a selection:
Book
III
Chapter
3
1.
Create your selection.
I’ll leave this task up to you; just use your
now well-honed selection expertise.
You can also apply transformations to a
layer or to multiple layers (for more on
this topic, see Book V).
2.
Choose Edit➪Transform.
If all you want is a single transforma-
tion, this command is adequate.
However, if you want multiple transfor-
mations, you’re wise to stick with the
Free Transform command, which I
cover later in this section.
3.
Choose a transformation type from
the submenu, as shown in Figure 3-12:
 Scale: Increases or decreases the
size of your selection
 Rotate: Freely rotates your selection
in either direction
 Skew: Distorts your selection on a
given axis
 Distort: Distorts your selection with
no restrictions on an axis
 Perspective: Applies a one-point
perspective to your selection
 Rotate 180°, 90° CW (Clockwise), or
90° CCW (Counterclockwise):
Rotates the selection by specified
amounts
 Flip Horizontal or Vertical: Flips
your selection along the vertical and
horizontal axes, respectively
As soon as you select your desired
distortion and release the mouse
button, a box called the bounding box,
or transform box, surrounds your selec-
tion, complete with handles on the
sides and corners. Note that you don’t
get a bounding box with the Flip trans-
formation (which just gets applied to
your image).
4.
Depending on which transformation
type you chose in Step 3, drag a
handle.
 Scale: Corner handles work best for
this transformation. Press Shift to
scale proportionately. Press Alt
(Option on the Mac) to scale from
the center.
 Rotate: Move your cursor outside
the bounding box. When the cursor
becomes a curved arrow, drag CW
or CCW. Press Shift to rotate in 15-
degree increments.
 Skew: Drag a side handle.
 Distort: Drag a corner handle.
 Perspective: Drag a corner handle.
Choosing Rotate 180°, 90° CW, or 90°
CCW or Flip Horizontal or Vertical will
just execute the command. Handle-
dragging isn’t necessary.
Photoshop executes all the transforma-
tions around a point called the reference
point. The reference point appears in
the center of the transform box by
default.
You can move the center point anywhere
you want, even outside the bounding box.
In addition, you can set your own refer-
ence point for the transformation by click-
ing a square on the reference point locator
in the Options bar. Each square corre-
sponds with a point on the bounding box.
5.
You can choose a second transforma-
tion type from the Edit➪Transform
submenu, if desired.
If you’re an ultraprecise type of person,
you can also numerically transform the
selection by entering values in the
Options bar, shown in Figure 3-13. 
In Figure 3-14, all the transformations
were executed at the same time.

Figure 3-13
Figure 3-12
Be sure to execute all your transforma-
tions in one fell swoop if possible. In other
words, don’t scale a selection now and
then five minutes later rotate it and then
five minutes later distort it, because every
time you apply a transformation to an
image, you are putting it through an inter-
polation process. Interpolation recalculates
the pixels. When you transform a selec-
tion, Photoshop either adds or deletes
pixels. You want to try to limit how many
times you interpolate an image because it
has a degrading effect — your image will
start to appear soft and mushy. The only
exception is flipping or rotating in 90-
degree increments. These commands are
interpolation free. For more on interpola-
tion, see Book II, Chapter 1.
6.
After you have transformed your
selection to your liking, do one of the
following: Double-click inside the
bounding box; click the Commit
button in the Options bar; or press
Enter (Return on the Mac).
To cancel the transformation, press
Esc or click the Cancel button in the
Options bar.
Your image is now magically trans-
formed. Note that if your image isn’t on
a layer, you can leave a hole filled with
the background color after your image
is transformed. Check out Book V to
avoid this calamity.

Transforming Selection Marquees
277
To repeat a transformation, choose Edit➪Transform➪Again.
Transforming Selection Marquees
To transform just the selection marquee without affecting the underlying pixels, make your
desired selection and then choose Select➪Transform Selection. Photoshop doesn’t have a
submenu with individual transformations to choose from. Instead, you must apply the trans-
formations like you do with the Free Transform command: by using the keyboard shortcuts.
You can also enter values in the Options bar to transform numerically, or you can access the
context menu. To move the selection marquee and the bounding box, simply drag inside the
marquee or nudge it by using the keyboard arrow keys. Transforming selections is particu-
larly handy when you’re trying to select elliptical objects. It is often hard to get the selection
precise the first time around, as shown in Figure 3-15, so applying a transformation is often
necessary.

Transforming Paths
After the bounding box is around the path, the transformation technique for paths is the same
as it is for selections and selection marquees, except that you can apply the distort and per-
spective commands only to whole paths. The major difference between transforming paths
and selections is in how you first select the path.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
All paths
To select all paths:
The Transform menu isn’t the only way to distort
selected pixels. A much more efficient way is to
use the Free Transform command, also found on
the Edit menu.
Like the Transform command, the Free
Transform command surrounds your selection
with a bounding box. Within the bounding box,
you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or apply per-
spective without having to choose the individual
distortions. You just have to use the right key-
board shortcuts. To scale and rotate, use the
same method as the Transform commands.
Here’s the scoop on the rest:
 Skew: Ctrl+Shift+drag (Ô+Shift+drag on the
Mac) on a side handle.
 Distort: Ctrl+drag (Ô+drag on the Mac) on
any handle.
 Perspective: Ctrl+Shift+Alt+drag (Ô+Shift+
Option+drag on the Mac) on a corner handle.
Unfortunately, if you want to apply a flip or rotate
by degree while free transforming, you need to
use the Transform submenu.
While the bounding box is surrounding your
selection, you can also access a context menu
that offers all the transform options. Right-click
(Control+click on the Mac) on your canvas to
access this handy shortcut.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Removing a Person (Without Getting in Trouble with the Law)
Sometimes you may want to take an ele-
ment out of a picture so that you can main-
tain the viewer’s focus on something else.
Or maybe you just don’t want the element
in the image. But remember, if you simply
delete an unwanted element without
cloning, you leave a huge space (colored
with the background color) where the
element was. Not smooth.
In the following steps, I show you how to
seamlessly remove an unwanted element
(in this case, a person) from an image.
When you’re first attempting this tech-
nique, I recommend that you start with
an image that has an element that isn’t
physically attached to something that
you want to keep in the image. In this
example, I use an image of a father
and son at the beach. What I’m moving
out of the picture (the son) isn’t touch-
ing what I’m leaving in the picture (the
father). Although in this example I’m
removing a person, you can use the
same technique to remove other
objects as well: trees, dogs, an old
wagon, and what have you.
1.
Open an image that contains some-
thing that you want to remove.
2.
Use the selection tool of your
choice to select the element that
you want to remove.
In this step, you’re creating a selec-
tion marquee that you’ll use to clone
another area of the image. You’ll
then use the cloned portion —
which is shaped like what you’re
removing — to cover up the element
you’re removing.
You don’t have to be super-precise,
so feel free to grab the Lasso tool. If
you need a Lasso refresher, see
Book III, Chapter 1. (For more pre-
cise selecting, use the Pen tool,
explained in Book III, Chapter 2.)
When you make your selection, be
careful not to cut off any portion of
your element. Otherwise, you’ll
leave some stray pixels — a dead
giveaway that something was once
there. Using the Lasso tool, I made a
rough outline around the little boy.

Position your cursor inside the
selection marquee, press the mouse
button and then the Shift key, and
drag your selection to move it hori-
zontally (or vertically if the image
warrants it) to an area of the photo
that you want to clone.
In the example, I moved the selec-
tion to the right of the little boy.
Notice how the selection marquee
is the only thing that I moved. The
pixels were left untouched.

With the Move tool selected, posi-
tion your cursor inside the selec-
tion marquee, press Alt+Shift
(Option+Shift on the Mac), and
then drag to move the cloned area
on top of the element that you’re
removing. Carefully match up the
edges, release your mouse button,
and then release the Alt and Shift
keys (Option and Shift on the Mac).
5.
Choose Select➪Deselect.
The cloned area should now cover
the element that you want to
remove. In the example, the
beach/ocean selection now covers
the little boy.

Depending on your image, you may
want to choose Select➪Feather and
enter 1 or 2 pixels before you move the
cloned area. Doing this softens the
edges and smoothes out the transition
between the cloned area and the back-
ground. (See the section, “Using the
Select Menu,” in this chapter for more
on feathering.) I didn’t feather my selec-
tion because it didn’t really need it. Try
it both ways to see which looks better.
Use the History palette to undo your
steps, if necessary (see Book II, Chapter
4 for more on the History palette).
The final step is to clean up any tell-
tale signs that the element was
there.
6.
Choose the Clone Stamp tool and
select a medium-size feathered
brush from the Brushes palette,
press Alt (Option on the Mac), and
click a good area next to a flaw;
release Alt (Option) and then click
the flaw.
If the Clone Stamp is a mystery to
you, be sure to check out Book VIII,
Chapter 3.
Repeat this step until you’ve fixed
all the flaws and the clone blends in
seamlessly with the background.
Don’t get carried away with the
Clone Stamp tool, or you’ll end up
with a smudgy mess. Being light-
handed is a good thing, as I was in
the now retouched image in the fol-
lowing figure. Nobody can tell that
only one man stands where two
people once stood.

Painting, Drawing,

Y
ou’re definitely going to want to brush up on your paint-
ing techniques now that you don’t have to worry about
messing up your clothes. Painting is one of the basic
skills you need to work in Photoshop, along with selecting,
working with filters, and other key abilities. After you master
the art of painting strokes, working with brushes, and using the
many options Photoshop offers with its painting tools, you’ll be
well on your way to Photoshop guru-hood.
This chapter introduces you to a plethora of tools and tech-
niques; I also give you a guided tour of the Brushes palette.
Discovering the Brush Tool
I’m going to be honest with you: If you can get the Brush tool to
work for you, you’ll be well on your way to Photoshop success.
That’s because so many of Photoshop’s tools require the use of
brushes. 
The Brush tool, and its hard-edged version the Pencil, use
brush tips and painting strokes to apply color to your images.
But that’s just the beginning. Take a look at Table 1-1 to check
out the versatility of these other functions, which operate in a
way similar to the Brush, even if their results are completely
different.
You can see that there are a dozen different functions that you
can choose from and apply using the basic techniques dis-
cussed in this chapter.

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
The Pencil and Brush tools are like peanut butter and chocolate. Not only do they work well
together, but they also share many important traits. You can access these tools in the Tools
palette. Press B, and the Brush tool appears by default. To access the Pencil, press Shift+B.
You can toggle between the tools by pressing Shift+B again.
As you can imagine, the main difference between the tools is that one has a hard edge and the
other has a softer impact. The Pencil and the Brush tools do have some other differences.
Find out more in the following sections.
Finding out what the Pencil tool does
The Pencil and Brush tools are very much alike, except that the Pencil tool has hard edges by
default (as shown in Figure 1-1) and the Brush tool can have soft, feathered edges. The Pencil
tool also has the ability to erase itself!

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
287
You can do all the following with the Pencil tool:

Drag the mouse to draw freehand lines.

Click at one point, release the mouse button, and then Shift+click at a second point to
draw a straight line between the points.
As long as you keep the Shift key depressed, you can keep clicking to draw straight lines
between each of the points.

Click, hold down the Shift key, and then drag up or down to draw a perfectly straight
vertical line. Drag left or right to draw a perfectly straight horizontal line instead.

Hold down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click in any area of your draw-
ing to switch the foreground color to that hue.

Choose the Auto Erase option in the Options bar to activate the Auto Erase feature.
Auto Erase is a handy feature that lets you remove portions of your pencil strokes without
switching to the Eraser tool.
When you have Auto Erase turned on, the operation of the Pencil tool is slightly different from
the default. The effect of either of the following actions is that Photoshop erases lines you’ve
drawn:
 When you click in any area of the drawing other than an area that is foreground col-
ored (for example, the pencil lines you’ve already drawn), the Pencil tool begins
drawing a line in the foreground color (this is the default mode).
 When you click in any area of the drawing that is foreground colored (such as the
pencil lines you’ve drawn), the Pencil tool draws by using the background color.

Because the Pencil tool doesn’t use soft-edged lines to draw, anything other than straight verti-
cal or horizontal lines has rough, jagged edges, as shown in the close-up image in Figure 1-2.
Jaggies aren’t objectionable in many cases, especially in higher resolution images, but if you
zoom in on an area containing pencil lines, the jaggies will be readily apparent. I show you
how to modify the characteristics of the lines drawn with the Pencil tool later in this chapter
in “Working with the Brushes Palette.”

Using the Pencil tool
If you’re ready to start using the Pencil tool, keep in mind that lines that aren’t vertical or hori-
zontal will look jagged up close. To try out the Pencil tool, work your way through these steps:
Figure 1-2
1.
Activate the Pencil tool by choosing it
from the Tools palette. (It shares a fly-
out menu with the Brush tool.)
You can press Shift+B to make it
appear if it’s hidden underneath the
Brush tool.
The Pencil tool’s current brush tip
(usually the 1-pixel brush unless you
select something else) is shown in the
Brush Preset picker in the Options bar.
Click the arrow in the Brush box to
summon the Brush Preset picker palette
if you want to choose a different-sized
pencil tip.
2.
If you want to draw using anything
other than the Normal mode, choose
a mode from the Mode options menu.
Modes other than Normal cause colors
to interact and blend in different ways.
You can find more about modes in
Book V, Chapter 3.
3.
Choose an opacity for your pencil
strokes.
If you want whatever is in the back-
ground to show partially through your
strokes, choose an opacity of less than
100 percent by using the slider or by
typing an opacity percentage directly
into the text box.

Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool is a basic tool used throughout Photoshop in various incarnations, so you’ll
want to master its use as quickly as possible.
The most important difference between the Brush and the Pencil tools is that, by default, the
Brush tool produces soft-edged lines that Photoshop renders smoother by a process known
as anti-aliasing. This is a technique that substitutes partially filled pixels along the edges of
lines to produce the illusion of gradual fading. Our eyes merge the transparent pixels together,
so the line looks smooth rather than hard-edged.
Although jaggy edges are most apparent in diagonal lines, Photoshop applies anti-aliasing to
brush stroke edges even in horizontal and vertical lines. The fuzzier the brush, the more semi-
filled pixels used to produce the effect, as you can see in Figure 1-3.

You can set opacity percentage in 
10-percent increments by pressing the
number keys while the Brush tool is
active. The 1 key equals 10 percent, the
2 key equals 20 percent flow rate, and so
forth. Type two number keys quickly to
also get increments of 1. For example,
type a 6 and another 6 quickly to get an
opacity percentage of 66%.
4.
Click and drag with the mouse to
create your pencil lines.

Book IV  Chapter 1: Exploring with the Painting Tools
290
The Brush tool shares most of the basic features found in the Pencil tool, except the Auto
Erase feature is not available:

Activate the Brush tool from the Tools palette or by pressing B (or Shift+B if you used
the Pencil tool last).

Choose a brush tip from the Brush Preset picker in the Options bar.

Select a Mode and Opacity from the options in the Options bar.

Drag to paint, click and Shift+click to paint straight lines, and hold down the Shift key
while dragging to constrain the Brush tool to horizontal or vertical lines.

Hold down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click in any area of color to
switch the foreground color to that color.
The Brush tool has several other options to select from:

Flow: Flow determines how quickly the Brush tool applies the paint. You can set a flow
rate from 1 to 100 percent by using the Flow slider or by typing a percentage directly
into the text box. You might think of it as controlling how wet or liquid the paint is. At
low flow rates, Photoshop applies the paint slowly so the color is not as dark; at higher
flow rates, the paint quickly reaches its full strength as you drag.

Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button in the Options bar to switch the Brush tool (as well
as many of the other tools that use brush tips) to Airbrush mode. This produces the
spray effect you get with a traditional airbrush. The longer you hold down the mouse
button, the more paint that pumps out of the tool, and the wider the airbrush effect will
spread, as shown in Figure 1-4.

Toggle Brushes Palette: At the far right of the Options bar is a button (a palette icon)
that shows or hides the Brushes palette. It’s a quick way to access this valuable palette,
and is also available with the Pencil tool and other tools that use brush tips. I show you
how to use the Brushes palette later in this chapter.
Working with the Brushes Palette
You’ll find the Brushes palette extremely useful for changing the characteristics of preset
brush tips and for creating your own. You can also access and select brush presets, as I
discuss later in this chapter.
You can view the Brushes palette in several ways:

Choose Window➪Brushes from the menu bar.

Click the Brushes palette tab in the Palette Well.

Click the Brushes palette button on the right side of the Options bar.

Grab the Brushes palette’s tab and drag it out of the Palette Well and onto your
Photoshop desktop. This mode keeps the Brushes palette visible until you put it away
by dragging it back to the Palette Well, clicking its close box, or rendering it hidden with
the Window➪Brushes command.

The Brushes palette displays a list of brush properties on the left and includes a brush stroke
preview at the bottom of the palette.
The largest pane in the dialog box is the upper-right area that shows various types of informa-
tion, such as the size and type of brush tip, or the different controls offered for any of the 12
different properties you can set.
Click the Brush Presets label in the upper-left. The various preset previews appear in the right
panel.
Choosing a Brush Tip Shape
When you have Brush Tip Shape selected in the left column of the Brushes palette, a scrolling
box shows the available brush tips, as shown in Figure 1-5. You can use the palette pop-up
menu to choose various views, including text only, small and large thumbnails, small and large
lists, and stroke thumbnail. (To access the pop-up menu, click the triangle in the upper right
of the palette.)
The 12 brush parameters that you can choose to apply and edit are arrayed in the left column.
You can select any of these options to apply them to the currently selected brush.
Figure 1-5

Choosing a Brush Tip Shape
293
Select an option to edit its characteristics. Here are the characteristics:

Brush Tip Shape: These controls let you choose the size and shape of the brush tip,
including the diameter, angle, roundness, hardness, and spacing.

Shape Dynamics: These controls include the amount of jitter (randomness or variation)
produced when you draw a stroke, amount of fade, the size, the jitter angle, the round-
ness, and other options. The higher the value, the greater the amount of variance for
each option. Some of these apply only when you are using a pressure-sensitive digital
tablet. Check your digital tablet’s instruction manual for more information on how to
customize brushes for your tablet. The Flip X and Flip Y jitter option flips the brush
shape across the horizontal axis (X) or the vertical axis (Y). For example, if your brush
shape is an L shape and you select Flip X, your brush shape will be backwards L. Check
Flip Y and your brush shape will an upside down L shape. Check both and it will be an
upside-down, backwards L shape. 

Scattering: This parameter controls the amount and position of brush marks in a
stroke. The higher the value, the higher the number of brush marks and the farther
apart they are. When you have Both Axes selected, Photoshop distributes the brush
marks radially, as if on a curve. The Count controls the number of brush marks at each
spacing point. The higher the value, the greater the number of marks.

Texture: This control allows you to impart a texture pattern to a brush stroke, either
one of Photoshop’s preset textures or one of your design. Select Invert to reverse the
light and dark pixels in the pattern. Scale sizes the pattern in each stroke. Texture Each
Tip renders each tip as it is stroked, giving a more saturated effect. Depth controls how
prominent the pattern appears against the brush stroke. Minimum Depth specifies the
minimum depth that the paint of each stroke shows through the pattern. Mode lets you
choose one of Photoshop’s blending modes, as described in Book V, Chapter 3. You can
find more about creating and working with patterns in Book III, Chapter 3.

Dual Brush: You can use two tips to draw with a single brush. This option lets you
select the characteristics of the second tip by using the same type of attributes — such
as diameter, spacing, and scatter — applied to the first tip. You can also specify a blend-
ing mode between the two tips.

Color Dynamics: This control uses your foreground and background colors to adjust
how the color varies during a stroke, allowing you to create a multicolored brush. Slight
variations give the stroke a more natural, organic look. You can introduce slight (or
major) jitter to the hue, saturation, brightness, and purity of the colors, as well as some
randomness between the foreground and background colors as you draw a stroke.
Without color dynamics, the stroke color remains constant.

Other Dynamics: These introduce randomness into the opacity and flow factors of a
brush, again making the brush stroke look more natural and less machine-generated.
You’ll want to experiment with all the dynamics to see exactly how they can affect your
image. Note that the Flow and Opacity settings in the Brushes palette do not override
those settings in the Options bar.
Book
IV
Chapter

Book IV  Chapter 1: Exploring with the Painting Tools
294
Here’s a list of brush tip characteristics:

Noise: Adds random pixels to brush tips, giving them texture and an organic quality.
This option is more apparent in feathered brushes.

Wet Edges: Makes the brush tip leave a stroke that looks more like watercolor, with
paint building up along the edges.

Airbrush: Gives the brush tip a soft, airbrushed look.

Smoothing: Smoothes out the curves when drawing arcs with the brush. Again, this
option is more noticeable when you use a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet.

Protect Texture: Ensures that all brush tips that use a texture use the same texture.
This allows you to switch back and forth between brush tips while painting and still
achieve a consistent texture.
You can now lock any of the brush characteristics by clicking the small lock icon to the right
of the characteristic. This ensures that the settings don’t change after you’ve gotten your
brush just so. This works especially well if you want the size of your brush to be correlated
with the amount of pressure you apply to a stylus when using a drawing tablet. By locking
settings, you override any specifications set by preset brushes. You can choose the Reset All
Locked Settings option from the Brushes palette pop-up menu to bring back the default set-
tings of the brush. And finally, to clear all brush options, select Clear Brush Controls from the
Brushes palette pop-up menu.
PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Just as there are valid artistic reasons for
shooting a photo in black and white, there
are equally reasonable rationales for
changing a grayscale image into a color
one. Perhaps the picture is an old one,
taken before color film was widely used,
and you’d like to colorize it. Or you may
come across a monochrome image that
would look even better in color. Photoshop
lets you restore black-and-white pictures to
their original colors or create whole new
color schemes. If you can imagine an image
in color, use Photoshop to add the hues
you want to see.
In my example, I chose a black-and-white
photo of a young girl. Instead of a full-color
treatment that attempts to duplicate a
color photograph, I want to apply a
trendier transformation that adds a touch
of color to the hair, face, and clothing. This
approximates the hand-colored look of the
venerable Marshall’s Photo Coloring
System of pigments, photo oils, spot
colors, retouch pencils, and other products
so popular in the ’50s and ’60s and enjoy-
ing a rebirth today. Although I’ve worked
with a Marshall’s kit myself, Photoshop is a
lot faster, easier, and more versatile.

Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color
to convert the grayscale image to a

presently still lacks any color).
3.
Choose Layer➪New Layer.
This creates a new transparent layer
to paint on. Although you can paint
directly on an image layer or a copy
of an image layer, using an empty
layer is safer and gives you more
flexibility in backtracking when you
make a mistake. For more informa-
tion on working with layers, consult
Book V.
The New Layer dialog box appears.
4.
Name the layer.
Although you can paint all your
colors on a single layer, you’ll find
that using a separate layer for each
part of the face lets you fade that
color in and out as required to blend
smoothly with your other hues.

e Select the Color mode from the
Modes drop-down list in the

Photoshop uses this blending mode
to combine the painting layer with
the image layer underneath,
enabling you to apply color while
retaining all the tones and details of
the underlying grayscale image.
6.
Select a color you want to apply
from the Swatches palette.
If you don’t find the exact color you
want, you can also use the Color

Press B to activate the Brush tool.
You may have to press Shift+B to
cycle to the Brush tool if the Pencil
was used last.
h Click the down arrow next to the
Brush Preset picker in the Options
bar and choose a brush from the
array.
Hard-edged brushes appear first and
the soft-edged brushes follow. You
might want to start with a 9- or 13-
pixel-wide soft-edged brush.
If you’re already comfortable with the
Brush tool, you can choose the
Airbrush option in the Options bar to
get a very subtle and soft effect. Just
be sure you pick the kind of brush that
works best for the area of the picture
you’re colorizing. (Use a small, fuzzy
brush for smaller areas, and use a
bigger, sharper brush for more stark
lines and wider areas.)
9.
Paint over all the parts of the
image that contain that color.
If you make a mistake, you can erase
the bad strokes without affecting
the underlying grayscale image
because you’re painting on a sepa-
rate transparent layer.
In my example, I chose a nice, light
blue color to change the color of the
girl’s eyes. A small fuzzy brush is per-
fect for a small area such as the eyes.
Change brushes as necessary by
clicking the Brush Preset picker in
the Options bar and choosing a
larger or smaller brush.

You can also make your brush larger or
smaller one size at a time by pressing
the [ and ] keys (the left and right
bracket keys) on your keyboard.
10.
When you’ve finished with that
area of the image, create a new
layer for each of the main compo-
nents of the photograph and repeat
Steps 4 through 8 with an addi-
tional color.
I painted the eyes, lips, shirt, cheeks,
hair, and hair highlights separately
because creating natural, subtle
effects with people’s skin, hair, and
eyes takes a special touch:
 Eyes: When painting the eyes,
paint only the irises and leave the
pupils their original black color.
Don’t paint over the catchlights
in the eyes, either. (Catchlights
are reflections of light sources,
such as windows or the flash that
made the picture.)
 Lips: Color the inner surface of
the lips a darker, rosier pink than
the outer surface. Lips look best
when portrayed in at least two
shades. Don’t forget to color the
gums with an even lighter pink.
 Hair: Hair looks best when the
highlights and darker portions
are slightly different colors.
 Skin tone: For the overall skin
tone, I chose a different tech-
nique using the Hue/Saturation
command. See the Putting-It-
Together project, “A Fast Way to
Colorize Skin,” later in this chap-
ter. To put a little blush in the
cheeks, choose the Airbrush
option from the Options bar and
work with a relatively large brush
size. Apply a good dash of color
to each cheek, and a lighter bit of
color to the forehead and chin. 
(I used a 100-pixel brush for this
picture.)
Be sure to pick a color that’s as close to
real life as possible. If the subject has
darker skin, you may need to move
away from rosier blush tones.
Be sure and check out Color Plate
4-2 to see the colorized image in full
living color.

When you’re finished coloring
your layers, you can experiment
with different opacity levels for
each colorized layer to see if more

A Fast Way to Colorize Skin
In the Putting-It-Together project earlier in
the chapter, you find out how to colorize a
black-and-white image by brushing color
onto the document. This project shows
you how you can get a more realistic skin
color by colorizing a person’s skin using
the Hue/Saturation command. This tech-
nique works especially well with those
who have naturally dark complexions.
Just follow these steps:
1.
Create a copy of the underlying
black-and-white picture layer and
then choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box
appears.
2.
Choose the Colorize option and
move the Hue slider all the way to
the left to produce a sepia tone. Set
Saturation to 25 percent and click
OK to colorize this layer.
3.
Use the Eraser tool to remove
everything in the colorized layer
that isn’t skin.
In my example (see Color Plate 4-2),
I removed the hair, background,
eyes, lips, teeth, and shirt.
This gives the entire face a nice
sepia tone.

Saving a New Brush Tip
After you’ve created your new brush tip, you can save it with the currently active brush pre-
sets by choosing Save Brushes from the Brushes palette pop-up menu (click the triangle in the
upper right to open the menu). For more information on saving, loading, appending, and
replacing libraries of presets, see the discussion of the Preset Manager in Book I, Chapter 6.
For some practice in using the brushes, try out the Putting-It-Together project that follows
and find out how to eliminate the dreaded red-eye effect.
Using the Preset Brushes
Photoshop has two brush palettes, in a sense. The Brush Preset picker, shown in Figure 1-8, is
tucked away in the Options bar and appears when you click the down-pointing triangle next to
the box that displays the currently active brush tip. I explain how to use the Brush Preset
picker in this section.
Photoshop has a large number of predesigned brush presets that you can use. The default set
includes six round, hard-edged brushes (which still have softer edges than the Pencil tool)
Figure 1-8

Using the Preset Brushes
301
and a group of 12 round soft-edged brushes. There are also airbrush, spatter, and natural
media brush tip presets, as well as a group of brush tip shapes such as stars, leaves, and
other shapes. And Photoshop CS has even more brush libraries, so go crazy.
A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a thumbnail image of the brush
shape when the palette’s display is in default mode. (I show you how to change the default
display of the Brushes Preset picker shortly.)
To use one of these brush tips, just click the Brush Preset picker arrow in the Options bar and
choose the tip you want from the scrolling preset list. You can augment your choices with any
of the following options:

Move the Master Diameter slider to change the diameter of the selected brush. This is a
quick way of getting a slightly larger or smaller brush when none of the presets meet
your needs exactly. For example, the largest hard-edged brush preset is 19 pixels in
diameter. You can click this brush tip and move the slider to the right to get a hard-
edged brush in any size up to 2500 pixels.
To change the brush size from the keyboard when a tool is active, press the ] key (the right
bracket) to increase the size and the [ key (the left bracket) to decrease the size. The amount
of change varies according to the initial size of the brush. To adjust the size more dramati-
cally, hold down the bracket key.

Choose the Use Sample Size option to get brush strokes of equal size. 
This option is new to Photoshop CS. Depending on the size settings in your Shape Dynamics
characteristics, when you use a scatter brush, such as a fish or flower, you will get random
variations in sizes. Select the Use Sample Size option before you use the brush to get a con-
sistently sized stroke every time based on a preset sample size. Note that you must select
the option each time you use the brush and you must also click, not drag, the brush for each
individual stroke to be equally sized.

Choose any of the library of additional brush tip presets provided with Photoshop.
Click the Brush Preset picker palette’s pop-up menu and choose one of the other brush
libraries shown at the bottom. They have names like Special Effect Brushes,
Calligraphic Brushes, and Faux Finish Brushes. Select one to append the brushes to
your current set or to replace the current set with the library you select (a dialog box
appears that offers a choice of either action).
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. See Book I, Chapter 6,
for information on using the Preset Manager.

Select your own custom library of brush tips that you’ve created. Click Load Brushes to
append new brushes to your current collection or to replace them with the new library.
Another option that may be available is the Hardness slider. If available, adjust this slider to
make the brush more (higher) or less (lower) fuzzy.
In the next section, I show you how to manage and edit brush presets.

You can change the way brushes are shown in the Brushes Preset picker and Brushes palette
by choosing a viewing mode from the picker’s or palette’s pop-up menu:

Text Only: This displays the names of the brush tips in several columns (depending on
how wide you’ve made the pop-up palette), as shown in Figure 1-9.

Small Thumbnail: This is the default view, with a thumbnail image of the brush tip and
its diameter in pixels.

Large Thumbnail: This view provides a closer look at the brush tip, as shown Figure 1-10.

Small list: This view shows a single-column list of the brush tips with their text names.

Large list: The larger list adds thumbnails so you can see the brush shape.

Stroke thumbnail: This view shows a typical ess stroke by using the selected brush so
you can see how it looks when applied, as shown in Figure 1-11.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Getting the Red Out Without Eyedrops
Red eye occurs when the subject of a pic-
ture looks directly into the flash, and the
unfortunate result is that eerie reddish
luminescence in the eyes that says, “Not
only didn’t I get any sleep last night, but
I’m also auditioning for the remake of
Michael Jackson’s Thriller video.” Color
Plate 4-1 shows an example of red eye.
The flash bouncing off the blood vessels in
the retina and right back into the camera’s
lens causes the red-eye effect. You’ll see
red eye most often in pictures taken in dim
light because the pupils are at their largest
in low-light conditions. You may also see
red eye if you’re using a camera with a
flash that’s very close to the camera’s lens
(thereby making it easier for the light to
bounce straight back into the lens). The
best way to fix red eye is to avoid it com-
pletely. That usually means getting a flash
camera that can work around it:
 Many cameras have a red-eye
prevention mode. Usually, this
mode triggers a quick, bright pre-
flash just before taking the actual
picture. The preflash causes the
subjects’ irises to contract,
making their pupils smaller when
the second flash (that is, the real
flash) goes off.
 Some cameras mount the flash
high or to one side of the lens.
This simple trick also minimizes
the chance of red eye.
However, these preventive measures are of
little solace when you’ve got a great pic-
ture that features bright red pupils as its
most dominating feature.
Here’s a quick way to paint out red eye and
restore your image to a less zombielike look:

b Select the pupil of one of the eyes.
I recommend using the Elliptical
Marquee tool.
Press Alt (Option on the Mac) to
draw your ellipse from the center

sweat it. You can fix that in the next
step.
c Choose Select➪Transform

down list in the Options bar.
The Color mode enables you to
apply color while allowing the tones
and textures of the image to show

Note that you can also use the new
Color Replacement tool to fix red eye.
Set the mode to Hue or Color and
follow step 9. For more on the Color
Replacement tool, see Book VIII,

i Paint inside the selection.
Only the pupil of the eye is selected,
so you can paint without fear of
covering up any other parts of the
eye. If you want to hide the selection
marquee, choose View➪Show➪
Selection Edges.
Because grayscale figures don’t do
this technique any justice, check out
Color Plate 4-1 to see color exam-
ples of getting rid of red eye. 
You may notice one or two catchlights
(reflections of light sources such as
windows or the flash that made the
picture) on the eye, which is unnatural.
Of course, having no catchlight at all is
even more unnatural! You can cover
the extraneous smaller catchlight in
each pupil if you want, but try not to
obscure the main catchlight.

P
hotoshop’s shape tools add an important dimension to
your drawing and painting capabilities. Whereas many of
the tools in the Tools palette are pixel oriented, creating
shapes and outlines from swarms of pixels, the Shape tool, like
the Pen and Type tools, initially creates scalable outlines by
using vectors rather than pixels.
Working with vector shapes gives you the freedom to resize
your objects at will, and convert them to pixels only when you
need to merge them with the rest of your image. This chapter
focuses on how you can create, resize, modify, and manipulate
vector shapes with the Shape tool.
Pixel and Vector Basics
Vectors describe a shape mathematically; pixel images, on
the other hand, describe the same shape in terms of a map of
pixels. Figure 2-1 shows both types of images. An easy way of
understanding this concept is to imagine how each of these
graphical measurements measures a square:

Measured in pixels: A square might be 200 pixels on a
side with the corners at particular X and Y coordinates in
the image file. The square contains a total of 40,000 differ-
ent pixels, each of which must be created and stored
with the image file.

Measured in vectors: The same square might be simply
defined as four points with equal-length lines connecting
each of them at right angles. The scale of the square
determines the length of the lines. It isn’t necessary to
store information about the area inside the square; the
vector image file needs to contain only the position of
the four points and the fact that they are each connected
by lines at a 90-degree angle.

You can see that to enlarge a square created by vectors, all you need to do is increase the dis-
tance between the points. To enlarge a pixel square, you need to create a lot more pixels. The
difference between the ways these measurements handle shapes becomes magnified (so to
speak) if the shape’s outlines aren’t perfectly straight or if points don’t connect at neat right
angles.
Resizing any sort of object made of pixels causes a problem: As you enlarge the pixels, the
object takes on a jaggy appearance in lines that aren’t horizontal or vertical. To enlarge a
vector object, on the other hand, you only need to rearrange the points that define the lines
or curves; the lines and curves themselves don’t grow and become jaggy.

Making Basic Shapes
When we create vector objects in a program like Photoshop, they are comprised of paths,
which are in turn made up of anchor points and straight and curves segments, or lines. You
can make these paths with the Pen tool (described in Book III, Chapter 3) or with the Shape
tool. The Shape tool can create five different kinds of basic shapes. Photoshop also has a
custom shape tool that lets you use preset shapes or create shapes of your own design. To
access the Shape tool, press U on your keyboard to select the currently active shape, or press
Shift+U to cycle through the available shapes. You can see the Shape tools in the Tools palette
in Figure 2-2, and in the Options bar in Figure 2-3.
Simply press U once and then choose the shape you want from the icons that appear on the
Options bar. These include rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, polygon, and line tools.
The Options bar shows icons for the Pen tool, Freeform Pen tool, and Shape tool whenever
any of these tools are active. You can switch back and forth between Shape and Pen tools by
clicking the appropriate icon in the Options bar. You can find out more about the Pen tool in
Book III, Chapter 2.
Choosing a preset shape to create
When you create a shape, you can place the shape on its own layer, which is called a shape
layer. The advantage of a shape layer is that, as with any layer, you can keep the elements
residing in that layer separate from the rest of the image. You can put several shapes in a
single shape layer, and you can control how the shapes interact with each other when they
overlap. (Some options include making the shapes appear to have been added together, sub-
tracted from, and so on.) Photoshop links shapes in a shape layer to a vector mask, which can
show or hide portions of an image. You find out more about shape layers and vector masks
later in this chapter. Here’s a list of shapes you can create:

Rectangle/ellipse: The rectangle and ellipse have no special parameters on the Options
bar; however, they both behave much like their counterparts among the selection tools.
For example, you can hold down the Shift key while dragging a shape to produce a per-
fect square or circle; hold down the Shift key plus the Alt key (Option key on the Mac)
to draw the shape outward from the center. You have other geometry options that let
you determine how you draw the shapes (unconstrained, fixed size, from center, and so
forth). I give you a quick rundown of your geometry options later in this chapter.


Rounded rectangle: This shape has the same options as the rectangle shape, with the
addition of a box in which you can type the radius of the circle used to round off the
corners of the rectangle.

Polygon: This shape includes a box in which you can enter the number of sides you’d
like for the polygon, in the range of 3 to 100, as well as geometry options.

Line: You can give the line shape a width from 1 to 1000 pixels and assign a layer style
and/or fill color. You can also enter parameters for an arrowhead at either or both ends.
I explain that option in more detail later.

Custom: You’ll find numerous preset custom shapes to choose from. As with any shape,
you hold down Shift to constrain proportions or Alt (Option on the Mac) to draw from
the center out. See the section on geometry options later in this chapter.
Choosing a shape mode
Here’s a list of ways in which you can create a shape (all options are found on the Options
bar):

Shape Layers: Click this icon to create the shape in a new layer of its own. When you
choose this mode, icons appear in the Options bar that let you choose a layer style
and/or fill color.
Shape Layers is a good choice if you want to keep your shapes in separate layers so you can
manipulate them further. The shapes remain scalable until you change them into pixels by
choosing Layer➪Rasterize➪Shape.

Path: Click this icon to create the shape on an existing layer. The shape appears as a
path that you can edit by using the Pen tools and the Paths palette. For everything you
need to know about paths, check out Book III, Chapter 2.

Fill Pixels: Click this icon to create a shaped area filled with the foreground color.
This option doesn’t produce a vector shape, but instead fills the shape with pixels.
The process is similar to filling a selection created with the Rectangular or Elliptical
Marquee or painting on your canvas with a painting tool. When you choose this mode,
the Options bar includes choices that let you specify a blending mode, the transparency
of the filled area, and whether you want the area anti-aliased. You cannot edit the shape
created with this option.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Drawing a preset shape
Follow these steps to draw a preset shape in your document:
1.
Access the Shape tool by pressing U.
2.
Choose the mode of shape you want
to draw from the three icons in the
Options bar.
See the preceding section, “Choosing a
shape mode.”
3.
Select your options — both in the
Options bar (if any) and in the geome-
try options drop-down palette, which
also resides on the Options bar.

Making Basic Shapes
311
Drawing multiple shapes in a shapes layer
After you’ve created a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes in the layer, adding to the
vector mask associated with that layer. You can add, subtract, overlap, and intersect shapes
in exactly the same way you do with selections, as described in Book III, Chapter 3.
You can combine and join two or more shapes, subtract one shape’s outline from another
shape, create a shape only from the areas that overlap, and so on.
Four state buttons on the Options bar, similar to their counterparts when a selection tool is
active, let you choose from these modes. You can see these buttons in Figure 2-5.
Hold down the Shift key to temporarily switch to Add to Shape Area while drawing a new
shape. Hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to temporarily switch to Subtract from
Shape Area. This works just like adding or subtracting selections.

in the mask column as a vector mask,
as you can see in Figure 2-4.

Setting Geometry Options
Geometry options for your shapes (rectangle/rounded rectangle, ellipse, polygon, and line)
help define how the shapes look. The following sections show you what you can do with these
options.
Rectangular shape geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the rectangle shapes, as shown in Figure 2-6:

Unconstrained: When you have this option (the default) selected, Photoshop defines
the size and proportions of the rectangle as you drag.

Square: Select this button to constrain the shape to a perfect square. (You can also
hold down the Shift key to do the same thing on the fly.)

Fixed Size: This option lets you draw rectangles only in fixed sizes. Type in a width and
height to specify the exact size.

Proportional: This option lets you define an aspect ratio, or proportion, for the rectan-
gle. Type 3 into the W box, and 4 into the H box, and you’ll be constrained to drawing
any size rectangle with fixed proportions in a 3:4 ratio.

From Center: Select this option to expand the shape from the center point you click.

Snap to Pixels: This option aligns the shape to the pixels on your screen.

Polygon shape geometry options
These are the geometry options for the polygon shape, as shown in Figure 2-8:

Radius: You can enter the radius of a circle used to round off the corners of a polygon
when you have the Smooth Corners option selected.

Smooth Corners: Choose this option to round off the corners.

Star: Select this option to create a star shape — that is, a polygon where the sides
indent inward rather than extend outward from the corner points.

Indent Sides By: The value entered here determines the amount the sides indent inward.

Smooth Indents: This option rounds off the inner corners created by indenting the sides.

You can see the difference between an indented five-sided polygon (a star) at right in Figure
2-9, and an outdented five-sided polygon, at left.
Line geometry options
The line’s geometry settings, shown in Figure 2-10, include whether to put arrowheads at the
start or end of the line, or both; the width and length of the arrowhead in relation to the
weight (width) of the line itself; and the amount of concavity in the arrowhead. Figure 2-11
shows the typical arrowhead shapes. The arrowheads in the figure are as follows, from top to

Using preset custom shapes
Photoshop’s preset custom shapes probably look familiar to you if you’ve been reading the
earlier sections in this chapter (in particular, “Choosing a preset shape to create”). But there
are a couple of additions:

Defined Proportions: When you use this option, Photoshop limits any shapes created
using this new custom shape to the proportions you use when you create it now. That is,
you can change the size of a new shape but only in proportion with the original custom
shape you create.

Defined Size: When you use this option, Photoshop limits any shapes generated based
on this new custom shape to the size you set now.
Choosing a preset custom shape couldn’t be easier:

Creating your own custom shape
You can create your own custom shape by defining the shape using a vector mask, work path,
or saved path. You can find out more about creating work paths and saved paths in Book III,

Book III, Chapter 2, describes the tech-
niques for adding, removing, and adjust-
ing the shapes of curves with the Pen.
Photoshop automatically places the
shape you create in its own shape layer
as a vector mask. Find out more about
what you can do with a vector mask in
the following section, “Using vector
masks.”
3.
In the Paths palette, select the path or
vector mask you want to convert into
a custom shape.

Creating Custom Shapes
317
Using vector masks
When you create a shape in Shape layer mode, Photoshop automatically saves the shape as a
vector mask. Essentially, a shape layer has two components. First, Photoshop entirely fills the
layer with color. Then, Photoshop places the shape, which (again) is comprised of a path, on
top. The thumbnails in the Layers palette visually display this concept. The color peeks
through the outline of the shape, and Photoshop hides (or masks) the rest of the layer. So in
other words, vector masks clip away the color of a shape layer. If you delete a vector mask,
you are left with just a layer of solid color. 
You can edit a shape that Photoshop has saved as a vector mask at any time. Simply click the
vector mask thumbnail to select it. Then use the shape and pen tools to edit the shape.
Here are some additional things you can do with a vector mask:

To remove a vector mask, drag its thumbnail in the Layers palette to the trash can icon
at the bottom of the palette. You can also select the layer and choose Layer➪Delete
Vector.

To enable or disable a vector mask, Shift+click its thumbnail in the Layers palette, or
select the layer and choose Layer➪Disable (or Enable) Vector Mask. Photoshop marks
the thumbnails of disabled vector masks with an X.

You can convert a vector mask to a layer mask by selecting the layer and choosing
Layer➪Rasterize➪Vector Mask.

Manipulating Shapes
You can manipulate shapes you’ve created by using a variety of tools. Here’s a quick list of the
things you can do:

Move: Choose the Move tool (press V) to move shapes in their layer.

Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.

Adjust anchor points: Use the Direct Selection tool to manipulate anchor points, direc-
tional handles, lines, and curves.

Transform shapes: Use the Edit➪Transform Path command or select the Show
Bounding Box option in the Options bar to transform shapes. For more information, see
Book III, Chapter 3.

Align and distribute shapes: Use active buttons in the Options bar when you have the
Move tool selected to change alignment and distribution along an imaginary line
(shown on the button).

Clone a shape: Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and move the shape with the Path
Selection tool.
You’ll find more information on manipulating shapes in Book III, Chapter 2.
Like all vector objects, vector paths print at the full resolution of the printer and are resolu-
tion independent. To avoid having your vector shapes first converted into pixels when print-
ing, you must select the Include Vector Data option in the Print Options dialog box.
Remember that if you select the Fill Pixels option in the Options bar, you’re stuck without
editing capabilities.

P
hotoshop offers several different ways to create objects
(shapes) out of pixels, and filling and stroking are two
of the most venerable object-builders at your disposal.
You can also paint objects on your canvas by hand, or convert
vector shapes to pixels (see Book IV, Chapter 2, for more on
that topic). But if you need pixels arranged into regular circles,
ellipses, and polygons, the Fill and Stroke facilities of Photoshop
should be your first stop.
Photoshop creates these pixel objects by filling selections or
closed paths with color or patterns, or by tracing the outlines
of the selections or paths. Those coming to Photoshop from
some other image editors may be confused at first, looking for
separate tools to create, say, rectangles and filled rectangles
when they want to build a shape filled with pixels. The Shape
tool, which creates vector outline objects rather than pixel
shapes, isn’t quite what they are looking for.
You can thank Adobe for not overloading the crowded Tools
palette with separate tools you don’t really need. When you real-
ize that you can simply make a selection of any shape and then
fill it or stroke it, you’ll never miss separate pixel-object tools.
This chapter shows you how to create these objects by filling
and stroking selections and paths, how to add smooth gradient
blends, and the best ways to apply patterns. After reading this
chapter, you will have your fill of different strokes.

Another way of filling is through the use of a fill layer, which you can use to fill a shape.
Because fill layers work a little differently than the types of fills discussed in this chapter,
I cover them in Book V, Chapter 1.

Filling a Selection with the 
Foreground or Background Color
The following steps show you the basics of filling a selection with either the foreground or back-
ground color (there are plenty of other filling options, which I discuss later in the chapter):
1.
Create your selection on a layer.
See the sidebar, “Knowing your selec-
tion options,” for help with selections.
Book V covers layers.
2.
Choose a fill color as the foreground
or background color.
Choose Window➪Color. Use the color
sliders to mix your desired color. For
more on choosing color, see Book II,
Chapter 3.
3.
Choose Edit➪Fill.
The Fill dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1,
appears. Here, you can select whether to
fill with the foreground or background
color. You also can choose color, black,
50 percent gray, white, history, or
pattern. 
4.
Click OK.
The foreground (or background) color
fills the selection.
You can also choose a blend mode, the
opacity of the fill, and whether to fill the
entire selection or only portions of the
selection that contain pixels (the non-
transparent areas). I recommend not
adjusting your blend mode and opacity
in the Fill dialog box, but instead
adjusting those settings in the Layers
palette, where you have more flexibility.
Figure 3-1

Filling Options and Tips
321
Filling Options and Tips
After you make a selection, you’re ready to use one of the filling options. You can use the Fill
dialog box (as described in the preceding section) to fill the selection with the foreground or
background color; you can also choose to fill the selection with color, black, white, or gray.
Photoshop is full of shortcuts and options. Here are just a few:

With the selection active, press Alt+Delete (Option+Delete on the Mac) to fill it with the
foreground color. All areas within the selection, including transparent areas, will be
filled with the color.

Fill only the pixels in a selection with the foreground color, leaving any transparent
pixels transparent, by pressing Alt+Shift+Backspace (or Option+Shift+Delete on the Mac).

Lock the transparent pixels in a layer (and its selections) by clicking the Transparency
icon in the Lock area of the Layers palette.

If you’re working on the Background layer, you can also fill the selection with the back-
ground color by pressing the Delete key. (Pressing Delete on other layers creates a
transparent area that shows the image in the layer underneath the selection.)

By clicking the Color option, in the Fill dialog box, you access the Color Picker where
you can select any color of the rainbow to fill your selection with. For more on using the
Color Picker, see Book II, Chapter 3.

Choose the Pattern option, in the Fill dialog box, to fill the selection with a pattern.
Click the arrow next to the pattern swatch and select a pattern from the pop-up palette.
Click the pattern palette pop-up menu to choose more pattern libraries. 

Select the History option in the Fill dialog box, to restore the selection to a state or
snapshot of the image. For more on working with the History palette, see Book II,
Chapter 4.

Paint part or all of the interior of the selection by using any of the brush tools, as shown
in Figure 3-2. This option lets you partially fill a selection by using a bit of flexibility and
creativity. When you paint a selection with brush tools, Photoshop confines the paint
inside the boundaries of your selection. For more on painting, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

Pour color from the Paint Bucket tool into the selection.

The first step to filling a selection is to make a

Elliptical Marquee tools. (See Book III, Chap-
ters 1 and 3, for more information about
creating and modifying selections with these
and other selection tools.)
 Select pixels by using the Magic Wand.
(Check out Book III, Chapter 1.)
 Paint a selection by using Quick Mask mode.
(See Book VI, Chapter 2.)
 Change a path into a selection. (Take a look

Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool, available from the Tools palette, operates much like a combination of
the Brush tool and the Magic Wand tool, as you’ll see from looking over its options. To use it,
select the tool (press Shift+G until it’s active) and click inside the selection you want to fill.
Here are your options, all of which are found on the Options bar:

Fill: You can choose whether to fill with a solid Foreground color or a pattern.

Pattern: When you’ve chosen Pattern from the Fill list in the Options bar, you can select
a preset pattern, load patterns from your pattern libraries, or create a pattern of your
own. You’ll find more information on patterns later in this chapter.

Mode: You can select a blending mode, too. You’ll find more information on these
modes in Book V, Chapter 3.

Opacity: Adjust this value to make your fill semitransparent.

Tolerance: Like the Magic Wand tool, you can choose a tolerance level that specifies
how similar in brightness a pixel must be before it is selected for painting. You can find
more information on tolerance levels in Book III, Chapter 1.

Anti-aliased: Choose this option to blend the paint in smoothly with the areas not filled.

Contiguous: When selected, the paint fills only pixels that are touching. When
deselected, paint fills all pixels within the brightness tolerance you specify.

All Layers: This option applies paint to pixels in all layers that are within the selection
and brightness/tolerance levels you specify.
As with other tools that fill, you can prevent the Paint Bucket tool from filling the transparent
pixels. Just select the Transparency icon in the Lock area of the Layers palette.

Stroking a Selection
323
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Stroking a Selection
Stroking enables you to create outlines of selections, layers, or paths. Stroking a selection cre-
ates a border around the selection. It’s up to you to decide whether to put the border inside,
outside, or centered on the selection. (Photoshop doesn’t care either way.)
To stroke a selection, follow these steps:
Book
IV
Chapter
3
1.
Choose a foreground color and make
a selection.
(Stroke can’t automatically use the
background color, although you can
select that color in the dialog box.)
2.
Choose Edit➪Stroke.
The Stroke dialog box opens.
c Adjust the settings and the options, as
described in the following section.
In the example shown in Figure 3-3, I
specified a 22-pixel stroke, centered
around the selection.
4.
Click OK to apply the stroke.
3
Figure 3-3

Book IV  Chapter 3: Filling and Stroking
324
Knowing Your Stroking Options
You can adjust the following settings in the Stroke dialog box:

Width: Enter a width for the stroke in the Width box. You can select 1 to 250 pixels. You
can also type in a value by using another measurement, such as inches, but Photoshop
converts it to pixel values before applying.

Color: Choose a color if different from the foreground color, by clicking in the Color
box. You can select the hue you want from the dialog box that appears.

Location: Select whether Photoshop should apply the stroke outside the selection,
inside the selection, or centered on the selection. (For example, a 3-pixel stroke would
extend 1 pixel inside and 1 pixel outside the selection.)

Mode: Choose a blend mode to determine how the stroke merges with other colors.

Opacity: The default value is 100 percent. If you want the stroke to be semitransparent,
type another value.

Preserve Transparency: Choose this option to apply the stroke only to pixels that
already exist, leaving transparent areas alone.
I recommend leaving the blend mode and opacity setting options in the Stroke dialog box
alone. Instead of adjusting these settings, create a new layer for your stroke and then choose
a different blend mode and opacity setting in the Layers palette. This maximizes your ability
to make edits.
Filling and Stroking Paths
Just as you can fill and stroke selections, you also can fill and stroke paths. These capabilities
enable you to create pixel shapes that take advantage of the powerful vector-oriented features
of the Path tools.
For example, you can use the Pen to create complex paths to form shapes and then rescale
the shapes to your heart’s content. Then, when you’re ready, convert shapes to pixels or
make an outline of the shape by using the fill and stroke features.
You’ll find the basics for creating paths in Book III, Chapter 2.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Filling a path
To fill a path with a color, follow these steps:
1.
From the Layers palette, select the
image layer you want to fill.
You must choose a layer other than a type
layer or layer mask. For more information
on type layers, see Book IV, Chapter 4;
you can find information on clipping
layers in Book V, Chapter 4.
2.
In the Paths palette, select the path
you want to fill.

Filling and Stroking Paths
325
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Stroking a path
Stroking a path produces quite a different result than stroking a selection — even if the selec-
tion is the same shape as the path. That’s because when you stroke a selection, you always
use a simple, solid line.
On the other hand, when you stroke a path, you can use any of the drawing or painting tools,
such as the Pencil, Brush, Smudge, or any of the other tools that use a brush tip. If you want
to add some flair to the outline of a shape, stroking a path is the way to go.
Aside from this visible difference, stroking a path outline is otherwise similar to filling a path.
Just follow these steps:
Book
IV
Chapter
3
3.
Choose the foreground color you
want to fill the path with.
4.
To fill the path by using the current
setting, click the Fill Path button in
the Paths palette. You then can skip
the remaining step.
To fill the path by using different set-
tings, open the Fill Path dialog box by
using one of the following methods:
 Hold down the Alt key (Option key
on the Mac) while clicking the Fill
Path button.
 Drag the path to the Fill Path button
while holding down the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac).
 Choose Fill Path from the palette
menu.
The Fill Path dialog box looks similar to
Figure 3-1.
5.
In the Fill Path dialog box, enter or
change settings to meet your needs.
In addition to the regular Fill dialog box
options (see “Filling Options and Tips,”
earlier in this chapter), check out these
bonus settings:
 Use: This option enables you to pick a
fill color, pattern, or history state. You
can select the current foreground or
background colors, color, black, 50
percent gray, white, a pattern, or the
area the path encompasses in its cur-
rently selected state in the History
palette. (For more on the History
palette, see Book II, Chapter 4.) If you
select Pattern, you can choose a pat-
tern from the Custom Pattern menu. If
you choose Color, the Color Picker
appears, enabling you to select your
desired color.
 Blending: This option enables you
to choose a blending mode and
opacity; you can also decide
whether to protect transparent
pixels within the path while you’re
filling it with color.
 Rendering: With this option, you can
choose a feathering radius to fade
out the color of the fill at the edges of
the path; you can also decide
whether you want to smooth out the
edges by using anti-aliasing options.
1.
From the Layers palette, select the
image layer you want to contain the
stroked path.
As with filling a path, you must choose a
layer other than a type layer or layer mask.
b In the Paths palette, select the path
you want to stroke.

making a partially transparent stroke
more opaque and thicker.
 Choose Stroke Path from the Paths
palette menu to enter changes in the
Stroke Path dialog box. You can
specify a different drawing/painting
tool, and select the Simulate
Pressure option, which varies the
width of the stroke.
 Hold down the Alt key (Option key

Working with Gradients

Working with Gradients
A gradient is a wonderful blend of colors that you can apply to a layer or selection, gradually
fading from one hue to another. Gradients can involve more than two colors, producing a veri-
table rainbow of variations. You can apply gradients by using preset selections of colors, or
you can create your own gradient.
You can create the following gradient effects:

Foreground to background: The gradient is a transition from the current foreground
color to the background color.

Foreground to transparent: The gradient is a transition from the current foreground
color to transparent, allowing whatever is under the transparent portion to show
through.

Black to white: The gradient is a transition from black to white.

An array of colorful selections: This includes rainbows, coppery sheens, and other
effects.
You can load other libraries of gradients from the Gradient palette menu’s libraries. They
have names such as Color Harmonies, Metals, and Special Effects. For more information on
managing preset libraries, see Book I, Chapter 6.
In addition to being able to control the appearance and application of a gradient, you also have
the opportunity to adjust the Gradient tool’s options, all of which are found on the Options bar:

Mode: Select any of Photoshop’s blending modes.

Opacity: Choose how transparent the gradient is.

Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.

Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother gradient that prints
with less banding (color stripes caused by the limitations of the printing process to
reproduce a full range of colors).

Transparency: This option determines whether Photoshop ignores the gradient’s trans-
parency settings when you apply a gradient. If you deselect this option, all portions of
the gradient will be fully opaque. I show you how to add transparency to a gradient
later in this chapter.
Book

Five different kinds of gradient methods are avail-
able in Photoshop, as shown in the following
figure:
 Linear gradient blends the colors of the gra-
dient from start color to end color in a straight
line.
 Radial gradient blends the colors from start
to end in a circular arrangement.
 Angle gradient creates a counterclockwise
sweep around the starting point, resembling
a radar screen.

6.
Place the cursor at the position in the
layer or selection where you want to
place the starting color of the gradient.
7.
Drag in any direction to the point you
want to place the end color.
Longer drags result in a subtle transition
between colors, whereas shorter drags
result in a more abrupt transition. Hold
down the Shift key to restrain the direction
of the gradient to an even 45-degree angle.

Creating and editing gradients
Although Photoshop includes dozens of different gradient presets, you may want to create
your own. Perhaps you’d like to create a gradient with your company colors or build one to
match the predominant colors in an image. Or you might want to create a gradient that
includes more than two colors. The Gradient Editor lets you create your own gradient preset,
using two or as many colors as you want, which you can save and reuse at any time.
The Gradient Editor has lots of options, but it’s easy to use when you know what all the con-
trols and options do. This next section leads you through the steps for creating your own new
gradient preset.

c If you want to base your new gradient
on an existing gradient preset, click
that gradient in the Presets window.
4.
Click the New button.
Photoshop appends a copy of the gra-
dient you selected to the end of the
Presets. If you didn’t select a preset,
Photoshop uses the default Foreground
to Background gradient as your model
instead.
e In the Name box, type in a name for
your new gradient.
f Choose Solid or Noise from the
Gradient Type pop-up menu.
A Noise gradient is one containing
random colors. Because the colors are
random, each time you create a noise
gradient the result is different. You can
choose which color model to use and
how rough the gradient is and select a
range of acceptable colors.
g Adjust the Smoothness slider. Drag
the slider (click the right pointing
arrow) or enter a value to determine
how smoothly you blend your colors
into one another. 
If you chose Noise in the previous step,
the slider changes to Roughness. This
option affects how smooth or abruptly
one color transitions into another.
8.
You can set the following options only
if you chose Noise in Step 6.
 Color Model: Select your desired
color model or limit the range
of colors by adjusting the sliders.
See Book II, Chapter 2, for more
on color models.
 Restrict Colors: Limits the colors to
printable CMYK colors only. Again,
see Book II, Chapter 2, for details.
 Add Transparency: Lets you
include transparency in your gradi-
ent, if desired.
 Randomize: Changes the colors in
your gradient. Click and each time
you’ll get a new set of colors.
i To begin defining the color of the
starting point for your gradient, first
click the left color stop button under
the gradient bar.
The triangle on top of the stop turns
black to indicate you are working with
the starting point of the gradient.
10.
Choose the starting color by using
one of these methods:
 Double-click the left color stop and
select a color from the Color dialog
box that appears.
 Double-click the Color box in the
Stops area of the dialog box and
choose a color from the dialog box.
 Choose Foreground, Background,
or User Color from the Color pop-up
menu in the Stops area of the
dialog box.
Keep in mind that if you select color with
the Foreground or Background option
when you change the foreground or back-
ground color, the color in the gradient
changes automatically. The change doesn’t
affect any gradients you’ve already cre-
ated, but it does affect any future gradi-
ents. However, when you open the
Gradient Editor again, you can revert to
your original foreground or background
color by selecting the User Color option.
 Position the cursor (it will appear as
an Eyedropper icon) anywhere in
the gradient bar to select a start
color from the bar, or position the
cursor anywhere within an image on
your screen, and then click to select
the color under the cursor.

or right. Drag the midpoint slider (a
diamond icon) to adjust where the
colors mix equally, 50-50.
You can also change the position of the
midpoint by typing a value into the
Location box.
Because the center point of the gradi-
ent is halfway between the start and
end points, the gradient will proceed
smoothly from one color to the other,
meeting to blend evenly in the middle.
Moving the color stops and the mid-
point changes the proportions.

amount of transparency for the gradi-
ent at its start point.
You can also type a value into the
Opacity box.
4.
Select the right opacity stop and use
the Opacity slider or text box to spec-
ify transparency for the gradient at its
end point.
5.
Move the Opacity stops to the right or
left to adjust the position where
Photoshop applies each stop’s opacity
setting.
6.
Click above the gradient bar to add
more Opacity stops if you want to
vary the transparency of the gradient
at different points.
For example, you could fade trans-
parency from 100 percent to 50 percent
back to 100 percent to produce a par-
ticular effect.
Gradients ordinarily proceed smoothly
from one color to another. If you’d like a
less homogeneous appearance, adjust the
Smoothness slider to a value of less than
100 percent (click the right-pointing arrow
to access the slider).
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Adding transparency to a gradient
By default, a gradient has 100-percent opacity in the start color and progresses to 100-percent
opacity in the end color. If you like, you can have the gradient fade out to transparency so that
the portion of the image under the gradient shows through. To add transparency to a gradient,
follow these steps.

Working with Patterns

Managing and Saving Gradients
If you’re smart, you’ll want to store the gradients you create so that you can use or edit them
again later. Here are some tips for managing your gradients:

To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog box. You can save
the current presets, including your new gradient, under the current library’s name or
another one that you choose.

To load gradient presets into the Gradient Editor, click the Load button and select the
name of the gradient library you want to add to the Presets list.

To add an additional set of presets to the current presets, choose the name of the
presets from the Gradient Editor’s pop-up menu.
For more information about managing gradient presets with the Preset Manager, see Book I,
Chapter 6.
Working with Patterns
Patterns are textures or repeating configurations of pixels that you can use to fill selections or
layers, apply with painting tools, smear around your image with the Pattern Stamp, or use as a
basis for the Healing Brush and Patch tools. Photoshop offers a large selection of patterns,
and you can create your own in two different ways.
You select patterns from palettes that appear in the Options bar for many of the tools just
mentioned, much like brush tips and gradients, and you manage them in much the same way,
using the Preset Manager (see Book I, Chapter 6). The following sections show you how to
apply a preset pattern and create your own.

Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter sticks with apply-
ing patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset pattern, follow these steps.
1.
Choose the layer or selection you
want to fill with a pattern.
2.
Choose Edit➪Fill and select Pattern
from the Use pop-up menu.
c In the Custom Pattern palette, select
the pattern you want to fill with.
 Choose a pattern from the current
palette, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 Replace the current patterns with
new patterns by choosing Replace
Patterns from the palette pop-up
menu (click the right-pointing trian-
gle at the right side of the dialog
box). Then choose the new pattern
library from the dialog box that
appears.
 Append new patterns to the current
set by choosing Load Patterns from
the palette pop-up menu.
 Append one of the preset libraries
furnished with Photoshop by choos-
ing the pattern from the list at the
bottom of the palette menu.
4.
Choose any other Fill options you
want to apply, such as Mode, Opacity,
or Preserve Transparency.
The Preserve Transparency option pre-
vents Photoshop from filling the trans-
parent areas on your layer with a
pattern.
I recommend adjusting the Mode and
Opacity settings in the Layers palette
rather than the Fill dialog box. This
allows you the maximum flexibility if
you want to make edits later.

Creating a new pattern
You can create your own pattern, basing it on an existing image or on one you create yourself.
Select a small portion of an image to build an abstract pattern, or use a recognizable object to
define that object as a pattern stamp. You can use anything from a logo to your signature as a
pattern.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
Book
IV
Chapter
3
1.
Open the image that contains the area
you want to use as a pattern, or create
an image from scratch.
2.
Make any modifications to the image
to produce the exact pattern that you
want.
3.
Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to
select the area you want converted
into a pattern.
You must use a rectangular selection in
order to create a pattern. Note that you
cannot use a feathered selection of any
kind.
4.
Choose Edit➪Define Pattern.
The Define Pattern dialog box opens.
5.
Enter a name for your pattern in the
Define Pattern dialog box.
Your new pattern appears in the
Pattern palette for use.
Using the Pattern Maker filter
The Pattern Maker filter is an advanced tool that provides even more ways to customize your
patterns. An easy-to-use dialog box, shown in Figure 3-9, helps you build a pattern that will fill
an entire layer of your choice. The cool part is that you can create a whole series of different
patterns and review them to find the one you like best.
As with creating a pattern from a selection, you must use a rectangular shape to build your
new pattern. If your selection is irregular or feathered when you enter the Pattern maker dialog
box, Photoshop will force a rectangular selection around your irregular or feathered selection.
The most valuable feature of the Pattern Maker is that it creates patterns that tile smoothly.
That is, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you need to fill an area, and the bound-
aries between sections blend together smoothly.
The filter’s dialog box has lots of features. Here’s a quick description of them:

Tools palette: In the upper-left corner is a small tools palette, containing a Rectangular
Marquee tool you can use to select the area to derive the pattern from, a Zoom tool to
magnify or reduce the image, and a Hand tool to move the image around in the viewing
window. Note that you can also press the Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) and
Shift+Ctrl (Shift+Ô on the Mac) shortcuts to zoom in and out.

Book IV  Chapter 3: Filling and Stroking


Status bar: Along the bottom edge is a status bar that shows the following bits of
information:
 Magnification of the preview
 Width and height of the whole image in pixels
 Tile grid, the number of copies of the image that will be needed to fill the entire
selected layer
 Sample, the width and height in pixels of the current image area selected by the
Marquee tool
 Preview, the number of different patterns you’ve generated so far from the current
sample (more on this in a bit)

Tile Generation: This area shows the size of the tiled image that Photoshop creates, the
type of offset used (horizontal, vertical, or none), and the amount of smoothness and
detail in the sample picture.

Preview: This area governs whether the preview window shows the original image or
the patterns you generate, and whether a boundary separates the patterns.

Tile History: This area provides a slide show of all the patterns you generate.

Generating a pattern
To create a pattern using this filter, just follow these steps:
Book
IV
Chapter
3
1.
To apply a pattern to an existing
image, first make a copy of the layer
that contains the image area you want
to convert to a pattern.
To apply the pattern to a new image,
select the area you want to use with the
Rectangular Marquee tool and choose
Edit➪Copy. Then choose File➪New,
choose Custom from the New File dialog
box, click OK to create the new file, and
paste the selection into the new image.
2.
Choose Filter➪Pattern Maker.
3.
Select the area to be used as the basis
for the pattern.
4.
If you’re creating the pattern in the
current layer, choose the Rectangular
Marquee tool from the dialog box’s
Tools palette, and select the portion
of the image you want to convert to a
pattern.
You can drag the selection marquee
around the image, use the zoom features
to change the magnification, or drag the
image around by using the Hand tool.
5.
If you want to completely fill the layer
with tiled versions of the pattern,
specify the size of the tile by typing
values in the Width and Height boxes
in the Tile Generation area. You can
also enter the offset (None,
Horizontal, or Vertical) to use and the
amount of that offset. If you’d rather
have only a single, non-tiled image,
click the Use Image Size button.
6.
Set other options:
 Smoothness: Set a value to deter-
mine how smooth the edges of the
patterns are blended with the sur-
rounding tiles.
 Sample Detail: This parameter con-
trols the maximum size of details in
the pattern.
 Preview: Choose whether to display
the original image or the generated
patterns in the preview window.
 Tile Boundaries: If you want, you
can insert a line between tiled
images to show their boundaries.
Select the Tile Boundaries option
and, if you like, choose a color for
the boundary that will show up well
against your sampled image.
7.
Click the Generate button to create a
pattern from your selection. You can
click the button multiple times to
create multiple pattern variations.
Photoshop displays all the different
patterns you generate in the Tile
History panel in the lower-right corner
of the dialog box.
You can review patterns in a slide-show
manner by clicking the Previous, Next,
First, and Last arrows.
8.
If you see a pattern you want to save,
click the floppy disk icon at the
bottom-left edge of the Tile History
panel.
9.
You can get rid of patterns that you
don’t like by selecting them and then
double-clicking the trash can icon in
the lower-right edge.
Tile History can save up to 20 gener-
ated patterns.
10.
Click OK when you’ve saved all the
patterns you want to reuse.
A typical pattern is shown in Figure 3-10.

P
hotoshop has morphed into a surprisingly good tool for
creating type used in images. The last few releases have
added features that let you create paragraphs of text or
simple lines of text used as headlines or labels. You can change
the spacing between characters, warp your type, check your
spelling, or even create selections in the shape of text. Drop
shadows, beveled type, and other special effects are yours
quickly and easily. And this release has given us the coveted
capability of placing text on or inside a path.
You may still want to use Adobe Illustrator or InDesign to
create professional layouts where you can keep text and image
files separate, or where you have to place buckets full of text
at small point sizes. But if what you’re looking for is a great-
looking image that includes great-looking snippets of text,
Photoshop can do the job.
This chapter introduces you to Photoshop’s type tools. If you
want to get fancy, check out Book IV, Chapter 5, which explains
some of our favorite image editor’s more advanced capabilities.
Selecting a Type Mode
The text you create in Photoshop can be categorized in several
different ways, but ultimately, you’re either adding just a little text
(such as a word or single line of text) or a lot (maybe a paragraph
or so). Accordingly, Photoshop separates type into two modes:

Point type: Use this mode to create a headline or label. You
can create point type by clicking in your image and typing;
the line appears as you type and grows to whatever length
you need (even if that length is wider or taller than your
image). Point type never wraps around to a new line. To
wrap to the next line, you must insert a hard return.


Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer blocks of text on an image. It’s (unsur-
prisingly) similar to the kind of type you’re accustomed to working with in word pro-
cessing programs. In Paragraph mode, all the text goes into a resizable bounding box,
and if a line is too long, Photoshop automatically wraps it around to the next line. 
The Point type and Paragraph type modes each operate a bit differently, although they share
many features and options. I explain each of them separately later in this chapter.
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
Whether you’re using Point type mode or Paragraph type mode, you can choose several type
options, each designed to help you work with, display, print, and edit text. These options
determine how Photoshop expresses text in a file:

Vector type: All text in Photoshop is initially created as vector type. Vector type pro-
vides scalable outlines that you can resize without producing jaggy edges in the diago-
nal strokes. You can also edit type in this mode, adding or subtracting characters or
adjusting attributes, such as kerning and tracking. Vector type is always of optimum
quality and appears crisp and clean.

Rasterized type: When Photoshop converts vector type into pixels, it’s rasterized. When
text is rasterized, it is no longer editable, but is, rather, a frozen graphic of what the text
looks like. When you’ve finished editing vector type and want to merge the text with the
other pixels in an image (or to perform some manipulations that can be done only with
rasterized text), you can transform the vector type into pixels by rasterizing it. You
can’t resize rasterized type without losing some quality or risking a bad case of the jag-
gies. For more on working with rasterized type, see Book IV, Chapter 5.

Pixel fonts: Pixel fonts are tiny fonts designed for display at small sizes on computer
screens. Unlike traditional fonts, which don’t fit into the natural pixel grid of your
screen (and thus look rough at small sizes, particularly when they’re anti-aliased), pixel
fonts are designed so every pixel corresponds to a pixel on your screen. These fonts,
with names like MINI 7, MiniSerif, and Tenacity, are created in fixed sizes (say, 7 pixels
high for MINI 7 or 10 pixels high for Tenacity and PixelDust). Diagonal lines are avoided
as much as possible, with the font designs favoring horizontal and vertical strokes. As a
result, pixel fonts look crisp and clear at small sizes without anti-aliasing. Indeed, you
shouldn’t use anti-aliasing with pixel fonts, nor should you attempt to resize or rescale
them. You can buy or download pixel fonts, install them on your computer, and use
them just as you use other fonts, keeping in mind they look their best at their fixed size.
Pixel fonts are often used in Web page design. You can see an example of a pixel font
compared to a traditional font in Figure 4-1.
Photoshop treats pixel fonts as if they were vector type, creating them on their own type
layer. However, pixel fonts look and behave more like bit-mapped raster fonts; you can’t
resize them easily. You’ll find them easier to work with if you change your font measurement
unit to pixels; choose Edit➪Preferences➪Units & Rulers (or Photoshop➪Preferences➪
Units & Rulers in Mac OS X) and choose Pixels from the Type menu.

Entering Text in Point Type Mode
341
Exploring the Type Tools
Strictly speaking, Photoshop has four type tools (found in the Tools palette), but two of them
are simply vertically oriented versions of the main two text implements. You can use either
Paragraph or Point type mode with any of the Type tools:

Horizontal Type tool: Use this tool to enter point or paragraph type oriented horizon-
tally on your screen. If you want text that is oriented at an angle other than vertical, you
can rotate it by choosing Edit➪Rotate after you have entered the text. This tool creates
the type on its own Type layer, except when used in Bitmap, Multichannel, or Indexed
Color modes, which don’t support layers. (Book II, Chapter 2, covers these modes.)

Vertical Type tool: The Vertical Type and Vertical Type Mask tools (described next) are
handy for entering Asian characters. However, you can also use this tool to enter
Roman character point type oriented in a vertical column. You can also use the Vertical
Type tool to create columns of paragraph text, but the results look a little strange. After
you’ve entered your text columns, you can rotate the text to an orientation other than
vertical by choosing Edit➪Rotate. Like the Horizontal Type tool, this tool creates type
in its own Type layer, except with file modes that don’t support layers.

Horizontal Type Mask tool/Vertical Type Mask tool: These tools operate identically to
their siblings described in the two preceding bullets, with two exceptions. Instead of
adding filled type, both the Horizontal and Vertical Type Mask tools create a selection
border in the shape of the type you enter. Both tools add a selection marquee to the
current active layer. You can do anything with a type selection that you can do with any
other selection, including saving it (Select➪Save Selection) for reuse later. You’ll find a
longer discussion of the type mask tools in Book IV, Chapter 5.
The Horizontal and Vertical Type tools have some interesting options, which I explain in the
next section. There are also controls you can set by using the Paragraph and Character
palettes, discussed later in this chapter.

bly not planning to include a novella with your graphics.

Point type is great for headlines, labels, and similar small amounts of text. You can also use it
to create logos and headings for Web pages. The Web is one place that text that isn’t tack-
sharp can still do the job. 
Although a Photoshop image is generally not the place you’ll want to insert a whole lot of
text, you can add larger blocks of text that are professional and effective — read “Entering
Text in Paragraph Type Mode,” later in this chapter. You can modify how point type and
paragraph type are displayed by using the Paragraph and Character palettes.
To enter point type, just follow these steps:
1.
Open a saved image or create a new
Photoshop document.
2.
Select either the Horizontal or
Vertical Type tool from the Tools
palette, or press T to select the type
tool if the one you want is active.
Hold down the Shift key and press T to
cycle through the four available type
tools until the one that you want is
active.
Your cursor looks like an I-beam, simi-
lar to one you’d see in a word process-
ing program. (See Figure 4-2.)
3.
Click the area of the image where you
want to insert the text. 
This is called the insertion point.
A small horizontal line about one-third
of the way up the I-beam shows where
the baseline (on which the line of text
rests) will be for horizontal type. If
you’ve selected the Vertical Type tool,
the cursor is rotated 90 degrees. The
baseline is centered in the I-beam and
represents the center axis of the verti-
cal column of text you type.
4.
Choose any of the type options from
the Options bar, Character palette, or
Paragraph palette. To access the
palettes, click the Character and
Paragraph button in the Options bar
or choose either palette under the
Window menu.
I describe these options later in the
chapter. 
5.
Type your text. Press Enter (or Return
on the Mac) to begin a new line.
Lines of point type don’t wrap around.
When you press Enter or Return,
you’re inserting a hard carriage return
that doesn’t move. You have to remove
hard returns if you want to change the
length of the lines you type.
6.
When you’ve finished entering the
text, click the Commit (the check
icon) button in the Options bar.
A new type layer with your text is cre-
ated. Note the layer that appears in
your Layers palette, as indicated by
the T icon.

Entering Text in Paragraph Type Mode
Paragraphs are best allocated to captions or text descriptions that accompany an image.
Large amounts of text in an image don’t look their best because when you rasterize the type,
even the most carefully entered text may have a fuzzy look.
Paragraph type is similar to the text you’re accustomed to entering within a word processing
program, except that it’s contained inside a border, called a text box or a bounding box. As you
type into a text box, the lines of text wrap around to fit the dimensions of the box. If you resize
the box, Photoshop adjusts the wrapped ends to account for the new size.
You can type multiple paragraphs, use typographical controls, and rotate or scale the type.
You can easily resize paragraph type (and point type, too) by entering a new point size value
in the Character dialog box without having to reselect all the text. Just make sure the text
layer is selected in the Layers palette and the Text tool is active. This works for all the other
text characteristics as well.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:

To commit your type to its type layer, you can also
do any of the following in addition to clicking the
Commit button (which looks like a check mark):
 Press Enter on the numeric keypad. The main
Enter (or Return on the Mac) starts a new line
or paragraph, instead.
 Hold down the Ctrl key (or the Ô key on the
Mac) and press the main Enter key (Return
on the Mac).
 Click any other tool in the Tools palette. You
don’t actually have to use the tool, but you
must click the tool (as opposed to pressing
the keyboard shortcut that’s associated with
the tool).
 Click in the Layers, Channels, Paths, Actions,
History, or Styles palettes.
 Select any menu command.

Creating Type on or in a Path
Adobe has brought a long awaited capability to the Photoshop CS type feature set — being
able to place type in and on a path. Photoshop now joins the ranks of Adobe Illustrator and
InDesign in being able to put type on and inside a path. In fact, the way you create path type
in Photoshop is even similar to those companion programs. Here’s how.
Figure 4-3
 Hold down the Alt key (Option key
on the Mac) and drag a box of any
size. The Paragraph Text Size dialog
box appears. You can enter the
exact dimensions of the box you
want to create. When you click OK, a
bounding box of the size you speci-
fied appears, complete with handles
for resizing the box later, if you
choose.
4.
Choose the type options you want
from the Options bar, or Character or
Paragraph palettes.
5.
Enter your text. To start a new para-
graph, press Enter (or Return on
the Mac).
Each line wraps around to fit inside the
bounding box, as you can see in Figure
4-3.
If you type more text than fits in the
text box, an overflow icon appears. You
can resize the text box by gripping any
of the eight handles and dragging.
6.
Click the Commit button in the
Options bar (the button looks like a
check mark).
Photoshop creates a new type layer.
You can also use any of the options in
the “Committing type to a type layer”
sidebar, earlier in this chapter.

Using the Options Bar
The Options bar, shown in Figure 4-5, contains a group of options, some (but not all) of which
are duplicated in the Character palette. Those options that appear in both places are the most
frequently used options. Talk about convenience.
Your options, shown from left to right in Figure 4-5 (starting after the Tool Preset picker), include

1.
Grab the Pen or Shape tool. Choose
the Paths option from the Options bar
and create your path.
Note that you can also copy and paste
an existing path or import a path from
Illustrator or other compatible drawing
program. See Book X, Chapter 1, for
details on working with other pro-
grams.
2.
With the regular Type tool (either
Horizontal or Vertical), click on or
inside the path.
Your type cursor changes to indicate
the path type. Note that if you are fill-
ing a path with type, you see a bound-
ing box appear.
3.
Type your desired text and marvel at
how the type glides along or inside
the path, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Commit the type by clicking the
Commit button in the Options bar. See
the section, “Committing type to a type
layer,” in this chapter for other ways to
commit type. After you commit the
type, the path itself doesn’t display
unless you stroke or fill it with color.
4.
To adjust the starting point for the
text, click the starting point with the
Path Selection tool and drag the type
to a new position.
The path appears along with an 
I-beam/black arrow cursor.
5.
Edit the text (changing characters,
colors, alignment and so on) just as
you would with regular type.
6.
Adjust the path by using any of the
Path tools — the Direct Selection tool,
the Convert Point tool, and so on.
The type magically reflows along the
newly adjusted path.
To create regular point or paragraph type
when clicking near a path, hold down the
Shift key when clicking, telling Photoshop
you don’t want path type.


Change the Text Orientation: Use this handy button to toggle between vertical and hor-
izontal text orientations. Just select the type layer you’d like to transform and click.
This option works with point type and paragraph type, although the results you get
from switching the paragraph type to vertical orientation may look odd.

Font family: Select the font/typeface you want from the drop-down list. If you have
more than one version of a particular font family installed on your computer, you’ll find
one of these abbreviations after the font name: T1, Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts; TT
(TrueType); OT (OpenType); BM (Bit-Mapped).

Font style: While some fonts can have additional styles, such as light or demi-bold,
most other styles are assigned as separate typefaces. Only the styles available for a par-
ticular font appear in the list. Some are available only in regular and italic, for example.
If a font you want to use doesn’t offer bold or italic styles, you can simulate either or both by
choosing a faux style in the Character palette.

Font size: Choose the size of the text from this list, or type a size in the text box.
Generally, text sizes are shown in points because that’s how text is most commonly
measured, with 72 points equaling 1 inch. (A 36-point font is 1⁄2-inch in size at 72 ppi.)
If you don’t like points, you can switch to millimeters or pixels in the Units and Rulers
Preferences dialog box. (You can find instructions for doing this in Book I, Chapter 6.) You
might want to use, say, pixels instead of points when creating text for Web graphics. If you’re
creating a banner that is 100 pixels tall, you will know that text that is 25 pixels tall will fill 25
percent of that space, for example.

Anti-aliasing: This list includes four different types of smoothing to use on your text,
plus none (which leaves your text unsmoothed). Some kinds of anti-aliasing are better
for text that will be displayed at smaller sizes.

Text alignment: Three buttons specify whether Photoshop aligns your Horizontal Type
tool text left, center, or right. When you use the Vertical Type tool, the buttons rotate 90
degrees clockwise and transform into Top, Center (vertically), and Bottom choices.

Text color: Click in this box to select a color for your text from the Color Picker.

Create warped text: This option lets you warp and bend text by using 15 different types
of distortion. You can find out about all of them in Book IV, Chapter 2. When used with
Paragraph type, the bounding box warps on-screen, too, so you can see how the para-
graph is changing.

Toggle Character and Paragraph palettes: Click this button any time a type tool is
active to show or hide the Character and Paragraph palettes.

Cancel: Click this button (or press the Esc key) to cancel the text entry you’re making. 

Commit: Click this button to apply the text to a type layer. 
Working with the Character Palette
The Character palette, shown in Figure 4-6, is a tabbed palette, usually paired with the
Paragraph palette, which lets you format the appearance of individual type characters. Five of

The other menus, buttons, and text boxes provide additional functions. I discuss these
options in the following sections.
Leading
Leading is the amount of space between the baselines of consecutive lines of type, usually
measured in points. (The baseline is the imaginary line on which a line of type rests.) You can
choose a specific amount of leading or allow Photoshop to determine the amount automati-
cally by choosing Auto from the Leading menu. 
Wider line spacing can make text easier to read (as long as you don’t go overboard!) or be
used for artistic effect. Tighter line spacing makes for more compact text but can decrease
readability if your tightening goes too far.
When you select Auto Leading, Photoshop multiplies the type size by a value of 120 percent to
calculate the leading size. So Photoshop spaces the baselines of 10-point type 12 points apart.
You can change this automatic value by clicking the Paragraph palette and choosing Justify
from the palette’s menu. A dialog box appears with several values. Type the amount you want
in the Auto Leading box. If all this seems confusing, I recommend experimenting with leading
to get a true idea of how various values affect the space between lines of text.

Tracking
Tracking is the amount of space between letters in a string or line. You can specify tight tracking
to squeeze all the letters together more closely, or loose tracking to let them spread out a bit.
Don’t confuse tracking with kerning, which deals with the space between two individual let-
ters. Tracking sets a value to evenly space all the letters you select, and kerning helps you
close or widen the gap between two individual letters.
One use for tracking is to help lines of text fit a specified horizontal space, and you can make
this technique work if you use it judiciously. Beginners typically overdo tracking, squeezing
letters together so tightly they touch, or spreading them apart so that wide gaps appear. You
can see examples of tracking in Figure 4-7.
To track a set of characters or a line, select the text you want to squeeze or expand, and
either choose a value from 0 to –100, or 0 to 200, from the Track menu, or type in a specific
value in the Track text box. Each unit is equal to 1⁄1,000 of an em (the width of an em dash in a
particular typeface), so a setting of –100 reduces the space between characters by 1⁄10 the
width of an em dash (quite a lot!).
Kerning
Kerning is a technique for adding or removing space between pairs of letters to make them fit
together more closely and aesthetically. For example, the letters A and V are a natural fit and
often look better when kerned slightly. If you choose Metrics from the Kern menu, Photoshop
automatically tries to kern the characters to provide an attractive look, like that shown in
Figure 4-8. Note that the kerning tables are built into the individual font. Be warned that cheap
fonts sometimes have poorly created kerning tables or no tables at all — another good reason
to stick with quality fonts.
To manually kern letters, click at a point between the two characters and either choose a per-
centage from 0 to –100, or 0 to 200, from the Kern menu, or type in a specific value in the Kern
text box. As with the Track menu, the values represent 1⁄1,000 of an em.
Vertical and Horizontal scale
The Vertical and Horizontal Scale options represent the relationship between the height and
width of the text. By default, this relationship is 100 percent. To make the width of the type
proportionately 50 percent more than the height, you enter 150 percent into the Horizontal
Scale box. You can see examples of scaling in Figure 4-9.
Figure 4-7

Working with the Character Palette
349
Be careful about using the scale options. Type designers create fonts with very specific
proportions. When you deviate from those proportions, you can destroy what was once
a beautifully designed typeface. 
Baseline shift and text attributes
The Baseline option adjusts the height above or below a typeface’s normal baseline that the
text appears. You usually employ this option to create superscripts and subscripts. A bar with
several buttons in the Character palette lets you turn on or off several type attributes with a
single click. The text attributes are as follows, from left to right in Figure 4-10:

Faux Bold/Faux Italic: Some fonts don’t have true bold or italic options; Photoshop can
fake either or both of these if you click the appropriate button. Faux fonts can look
good, except at smaller sizes.

Applying faux styles can distort the proportions of a font. It is really best to use fonts as they
were originally designed and if there is no bold or italic option, c’est la vie.

All Caps: This button changes the case of the characters in selected text to all capitals,
or back to their normal case when you turn it off.

Small Caps: Small caps are uppercase letters about the size of lowercase letters in a
font. They are most frequently used for acronyms and abbreviations, such as NASA or
AM/PM because they are less obtrusive than full-size caps in text passages. Click this
button, and Photoshop either uses the small caps characters built into many fonts or
creates faux small caps for you.

Superscript: Click this button to raise a character automatically to create a superscript,
as in E=MC2. You’ll probably also want to reduce the size of the character.

Subscript: Click this button to lower the character below the baseline, creating a
subscript. Usually, subscripts are reduced in size, as in H2O.

Underline: Click this button to underline the selected characters, like this.

Strikethrough: Click the button to provide a strikethrough effect to the selected charac-
ters. In legal applications, strikethrough is widely used to show sections that have been
removed, but in their original context.

Character Set: (Refer to Figure 4-6.) Use this drop-down list to select the language you
want to use for Photoshop’s spell checker and for hyphenation. The option includes
variations, such as USA English or British English, and French or Canadian French.
You can also find the preceding attributes on the Character palette pop-up menu. And the
menu lists a few other attributes that are not displayed directly in the palette:

Standard Vertical Roman Alignment: Displays the text in the standard alignment we
are used to seeing — across the page.

Change Text Orientation: Rotates your text horizontally or vertically. You can also click
the button in the left side of the Options bar to do the same task. 

Fractional Widths: This setting is the default display. When type gets small, the spacing
between characters may vary by fractions of a pixel. Photoshop has to favor one pixel
or the other and sometimes the appearance is strange. Overall, however, it provides the
best spacing for the legibility and appearance of the type. But, for small type to be dis-
played on the Web, the readability may be impaired due to some characters running
together and words having gaps.

System Layout: Displays the text using the operating system’s default text handling,
similar to what you see in WordPad or SimpleText. This option doesn’t allow fractions
of pixels and removes any anti-aliasing. This is a good option for text to be displayed on
the Web.

No Break: Prevents words from breaking at the end of lines. You may want to select this
option to prevent words such as proper names, dates, initials and so forth from break-
ing. Select your text and then choose the option.

Working with the Paragraph Palette


Old Style to Fractions: When you work with OpenType fonts, you may find that they
include tables of various font attributes. These tables allow you to apply various styles,
such as true, diagonal fractions, alternate Old Style numerals, fancy cursive type upper-
case letters (Swash and Titling), ligatures (designed to fix the kerning of certain awk-
ward letter combinations such as fi and tt), and ornamental fonts (think dingbats or
wingdings) such as leaves and flowers.

Reset Character: Choose this option to reset your character attributes (font family, size,
style and so on) back to Photoshop’s default.
Working with the Paragraph Palette
You can use the Paragraph palette, shown in Figure 4-11, to format any or all paragraphs in a
type layer. Simply select the paragraph or paragraphs that you want to format by clicking in
an individual paragraph. You can drag a selection to select multiple paragraphs; or click a
type layer containing the paragraphs to format all of them at once.
The Paragraph palette’s pop-up menu gives you access to Justification and Hyphenation
dialog boxes. You can use these to customize the default settings Photoshop uses for these
functions. As a side note, if you’re not familiar with the word glyph used in the Justification
dialog box, it is another word for font character.
Changing paragraph alignment
At the top of the Paragraph palette, you see a set of seven alignment buttons. Three align non-
justified text. They include the following:

With vertical type, these choices align the text to the top, a center axis, and the bottom of a
column.
Changing paragraph justification
The other four options in the Paragraph palette produce justified text, in which Photoshop
inserts spaces between characters as necessary so each line is flush on both left and right
sides. The options apply only to the last line of text in each paragraph. You can choose to
make this last line flush left, flush right, centered, or force justified on both sides with spaces
inserted by Photoshop. This last option sometimes calls for some manual tweaking to avoid a
final line that is squeezed or expanded too much. Note that you can apply justification options
to paragraph type only, not point type.
With vertical type, the justification choices are top aligns, center aligns, bottom aligns, or
force justifies the last line of text.
Changing paragraph indentation
The next three options in the Paragraph palette let you enter an amount of indentation
between the sides of the text bounding box and the actual text. You can specify the amount of
indentation from the left, right, and for the first line of the paragraph (creating a first line that
is indented more than the others in the paragraph). For vertical type, the indentations are
rotated 90 degrees.
Changing spacing between paragraphs
The next two options in the Paragraph palette let you specify the amount of space between
paragraphs. You can specify the amount of space before every paragraph, the amount after
every paragraph, or both.
Breaking long words across two lines
The final option in the Paragraph palette is the Hyphenate check box, which specifies whether
Photoshop hyphenates words that are too long to fit on a line or leaves them intact. Turning
on hyphenation can prevent awkward spacing, particularly with justified text that would
otherwise contain a lot more spaces between characters to make a line fit.
There are a few additional options that are found only on the Paragraph palette’s pop-up menu:

Roman Hanging Punctuation: Controls whether punctuation marks (quotations,
dashes, colons and so on) appear inside or outside the margins. Select this option to
have the punctuation marks appear outside.

Adobe Single-line Composer: Composition includes using a host of parameters, such as
word and letter spacing and hyphenation to determine where a line should break. This
option composes type one line at a time and offers more manual control over where
lines break. The option favors compressing or expanding word spacing over hyphen-
ation, but prefers hyphenation over compressing or expanding letter spacing. This is
the default setting.

Editing Text
353

Adobe Every-line Composer: Looks at multiple, possible breaking points for a range of
lines. The option can optimize earlier lines in the paragraph to avoid weird breaks later
on in the paragraph. Emphasis is given to even spacing of letters and words over
hyphenation. This option can provide more even spacing and fewer hyphens.

Reset Paragraph: Resets all the paragraph attributes back to the Photoshop default.

Finding and replacing text
You can make global changes in a text layer, switching all occurrences of a set of characters to
another string. For example, you might have typed Ghandi a few dozen times before remem-
bering that the Mahatma’s name is spelled Gandhi. To replace text, follow these steps:
1.
Open a saved image or create a new
Photoshop document.
2.
Select the type layer you want to
modify.
3.

Checking your spelling
Photoshop can check your spelling by using an internal dictionary that you can update with
words of your own. Even though you’re not likely to enter huge amounts of text in Photoshop,
that’s no excuse for misspelling the words that you do include. Indeed, because it’s so difficult
to change text after you’ve rasterized a text layer, the spell checker can save you a great deal
of work. Here’s how to use it:
Figure 4-12
1.
Open a saved image or create a new
Photoshop document.
2.
Make sure that you’ve specified the
correct language in the Character
palette’s language menu.
3.
Select the text that you want to check,
or select a type layer to check all the
text on that layer.
4.
Choose Edit➪Check Spelling.
5.
When Photoshop identifies a possible
error in the Not in Dictionary box,
click Change to substitute the recom-
mended correction for the word that
is spelled incorrectly. 
Or you can choose from one of these
options:
 Ignore: Leaves the word alone and
continues to check the next text.
 Ignore All: Ignores all instances of
the word for the rest of the spell-
check session.
 Suggestions: Choose a different
word from the Suggestions text box,
or type in the correct spelling your-
self.
 Change All: Corrects all occur-
rences of the misspelled word.
 Add: Add the unfamiliar word to
Photoshop’s dictionary.
Deselect the Check All Layers option to
check only the currently selected layer.
6.
Click Done when you’re finished.
The Check Spelling dialog box closes.
9.
As each string is found, select
whether you want to

next occurrence.

Y
ou can do a lot more with type than create labels, cap-
tions, or paragraphs of text. Type can become an integral
part of the decorative design, especially when you stylize,
warp, or otherwise transform it in interesting ways.
Your Photoshop text can have character, too, communicating
messages with more than just words. The text of a beach scene
can appear to be wavy or watery and translucent. Halloween
type can take on a ghostly or spooky appearance. Type can be
romantic, otherworldly, cheerful, or comical. It all depends on
how you create and apply it.
This chapter shows you some of the tricks you can perform by
masking, warping, and shaping your type so your words come
to life and add something special to your images.
Playing with Type Layer Opacity
Layers are the stacks of overlays on which each of the elements
of your image reside. (Check out Book V, Chapter 1, for the low-
down on layers.) You can change the transparency of a type
layer the same as you can with any other layer in Photoshop,
reducing the opacity (transparency) of the type so it allows the
underlying layer to show through. Take a look at Figure 5-1,
which shows type at varying levels of opacity over an image.

and Warping Type 5

Changing the opacity of a type layer can convey an idea of gradual visibility of words onto an
image. When working with opacity in multiple layers of type, you can create a sort of nonani-
mated fade-in, each with a greater opacity. Figure 5-2 shows an example of this effect.
One way to alter the transparency of type is to use a layer mask. (Check out Book VI, Chap-
ter 3, for more information on layer masks.) Why would you want to use the layer mask
instead of simply applying a gradient to the type itself? In practice, you can’t apply a gradient
to a type layer until the type is rasterized (as described later in the chapter). By fading the
type with a layer mask, you can customize your fading effect as much as you like and still edit
the text to change the wording, font size, font, or anything else.
The first Putting-It-Together project in this chapter shows you another way to use type opac-
ity to create a ghostly effect.

Creating Fade Effects
To create a “fade out” image, just follow these steps:
Book
IV
Chapter
5
1.
Enter the words Fading out slowly (or
other text of your choice) into a new
type layer.
You find out how to enter text in Book
IV, Chapter 4.
2.
Choose Layer➪Add Layer Mask➪
Reveal All.
This creates a mask that can show or
hide some of the layer. With Reveal All
selected, the layer defaults to showing
everything on the layer without hiding
any of it.
3.
Press D to make sure that Photoshop’s
colors are the default black and
white.
4.
Choose the Gradient tool from the
Tools palette.
Or press Shift+G until it is active.
5.
Select the Linear Gradient from the
Options bar.
6.
Click the layer mask’s icon in the
Layers palette to make sure it is
active.
7.
Click the right side of the type layer
and drag to the left side.
Photoshop creates a gradient in the
layer mask that is black on the right
and fades to white on the left, as
shown in Figure 5-3. That means the
mask is most transparent on the left
side (where the mask is white) and
least transparent on the right side
(where the mask is black). It reveals
more of the original type on the left
and fades it out on the right, as you
can see in Figure 5-4 to the left of the
words “Fading out slowly.”

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Ghosting Your Type
Need some ghostly, semitransparent type?
You can twist, transmogrify, and transform
your text by using Photoshop’s arsenal of
features.
You can create your type from scratch in
an empty document or add the type to an
existing picture or background. For the
heck of it, these steps show you how to
add ghostly writing to an existing image.
Just follow these steps:
a Open the background image you
want to overlay with the ghost
type.
The image I chose is already a little
eerie because I reversed the colors
of the original picture to make it look
like a negative by pressing Ctrl+I
(Ô+I on the Mac) and then colorized
the negative to its original orange
hue. See Book VIII, Chapter 1, to find
out how to colorize an image.
2.
Choose the color you’d like to use
for your text from the Swatches
palette.
Black is a good Halloween comple-
ment to orange, but you can use any
contrasting color.
3.
Choose the Horizontal Type tool
from the Tools palette and then
click the area where you want to
add the text.
The vertical cursor that appears is
the same size that the text will be.
d Choose a font size from the drop-
down list in the Options bar.
e Choose a font and style for the font.
Not every style (regular, italic, bold,
or bold italic) is available for every
font.
6.
Use anti-aliasing to select how you
want Photoshop to smooth the
edges of your type.
Anti-aliasing, which I cover in Book
IX, Chapter 1, softens a hard edge by
adding partially transparent pixels.
You can choose None (meaning
you’ll have jagged edges, also
known as jaggies), Sharp, Crisp,
Strong, or Smooth.
g Type your text.
The text appears on top of the
background.
8.
Click the Commit button (the check
icon) on the Options bar to insert
the text you’ve typed into a layer
of its own.
9.
Choose File➪Save to save your fin-
ished image.

You can make modifications to the type by
using filters. You should save the project
before moving forward. That way, if you
don’t like what you get, you don’t have to
keep it.
To make additional changes to the
text (such as to make it zig and
zag, as I did in my example), use a
filter. For example, if you want to
make the text wavy, use the Wave
filter in the Distort Type submenu.
1.
Choose Filter➪Distort➪ZigZag.
The ZigZag dialog box opens.
Or you can choose other filters from
the array discussed in Book VII.
2.
A warning dialog box pops up,
informing you that the type layer
must be rasterized (converted
from editable text to pixels) before
you can use the filter. Click OK.
c If you’re using the ZigZag filter,
choose an option from the Style
drop-down list in the dialog box.
Move the Amount slider to add as
much distortion as you like.
In my example, I chose Around
Center from the Style drop-down
list. I moved the Amount slider to 23
percent and adjusted the Ridges
slider to increase waviness even
more.
d Click OK to apply the distortion.
e To change the opacity of the type
(such as to make it semitranspar-
ent), adjust the Opacity setting in
the Layers palette.
6.
When you’re satisfied with the
look, save your image for addi-
tional editing later, or choose
Layer➪Flatten Image to combine
the text and background.

Creating Type Outlines

Creating Type Outlines
In addition to its Vertical and Horizontal Type tools (discussed in Book IV, Chapter 4),
Photoshop includes Vertical and Horizontal Type Mask tools. These function almost identi-
cally to their conventional counterparts, with one important exception: Type mask tools don’t
create a new layer. Instead, they create a selection within the currently active layer, like the
one shown in Figure 5-5.
You can treat the selections created with the type mask tools just as you can any other 
selection. Try the following:

Move type mask selections around your document when any of the selection tools are
active.

Store type selections as alpha channels by using the Select➪Save Selection command.
I introduce selections in Book III, Chapter 3. You can find out how to save selections in
Book VI, Chapter 1.

Skew type selections (or change them in some other way) by using the
Select➪Transform command. You can find more information on transforming selections
in Book III, Chapter 3.

Convert a selection into an editable path, as described in “Transforming Type into
Vector Shapes and Paths,” later in this chapter.

Use the selection to cut or copy portions of an image in text-shaped chunks, as shown
in Figure 5-6.

Book IV  Chapter 5: Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
362
You can find out how this last suggestion works by following the steps in the Putting-It-
Together project at the end of this chapter, in which you find out how to literally carve your
words in stone.
Rasterizing Your Type Layer
The Type tool creates editable type layers. You can change the wording, spacing, font, font
size, and other factors as much as you want, as long as the type remains in a type layer. (For
more information on editing type, see Book IV, Chapter 4.)
However, after you’ve made all the changes you want, you need to convert your type layer to
pixels in the form of rasterized type. After they’re rasterized, you can apply filters, paint on
the type, and apply gradients and patterns. Rasterizing type layers allows you to merge the
type with other pixels in your image and, eventually, flatten the image to create a finished
document suitable for use with other programs.
After you’ve converted your type to pixels, you can no longer edit the type. Nor can you
resize the text without risking jaggies. You’ll want to rasterize your type only when you’re
certain you won’t need to edit or resize it. Make a copy of the type layer before you rasterize
it and toggle off the visibility. For more on layers, see Book V. 
To rasterize your type, select the type layer that you want to convert to pixels. Then choose
Layer➪Rasterize➪Type. The type is shown in the Layers palette on a transparent background.
Transforming Type into Vector Shapes and Paths
By default, regular type created with the Type tool is vector-based type, not bit-mapped, ras-
terized type. But you can also convert regular type (each character) to individual vector
shapes. The individual characters then become shapes defined by vector masks. You can edit
the shapes like any shapes created with the shape tools, by manipulating anchor points and
straight and curved segments. See Book IV, Chapter 2, for the lowdown on shapes. And you
can also convert regular type to work paths where each character becomes a path, editable
like any other path with the selection arrows and pen tools. Type is usually converted into a
path in order to create a clipping path based on the type (see Book III, Chapter 2). For more
on paths, see Book III, Chapter 2.
In order to retain the vector properties of regular text, you must select the Include Vector Data
option in the Save dialog box. Otherwise, Photoshop rasterizes the text when you save it.
So again, you can convert regular nonrasterized vector type to Photoshop line/curve-oriented
shapes in the form of a vector mask or work path. You convert type to vector shapes and
paths in order to edit it with the Pen tools. Here are the ways to do that:

To convert type to an editable work path, choose Layer➪Type➪Create Work Path. (You
can also choose Make Work Path in the Paths palette option menu.)

To convert type to shapes, choose Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shapes.

Transforming Type into Vector Shapes and Paths
363
Here are the chief things to know about type converted into a shape or path:

Like type layers, you can resize it without producing jagged diagonal lines.

You can edit the shape of the characters, but you cannot edit the text itself, as shown
in Figure 5-7.

You must rasterize the converted type before you can merge it with pixel-based layers or
apply special effects with filters. You can apply layer styles to the converted type, how-
ever. Be sure to check out Book V, Chapter 4, for all you need to know about layer styles.

If you have converted your type into a shape, it becomes a vector mask exactly like
other vector masks in Photoshop, and you can edit the shape of the characters by using
the pen tools. You can find detailed information on editing vector masks in Book VI,
Chapter 3.
Figure 5-7
Book
IV
Chapter
5
In addition to rasterizing a type layer in the usual
way, you can also rasterize it by merging it with
a non-type layer. For example, if your type layer
appears immediately above a text layer that has
already been rasterized, you can merge the
layers by pressing Ctrl+E (Ô+E on the Mac).
You may also come across the opportunity to ras-
terize a type layer because Photoshop reminds
you to. Some commands, for example, particularly
filters, operate only on pixels. When you try to use
them, you may see a warning dialog box. Often,
the dialog box includes an option for immediately
converting the type layer to raster form.
Rasterizing type the other way

Book IV  Chapter 5: Masking, Shaping, and Warping Type
364
Wreaking Havoc on Your Type
Photoshop’s great automated Warp feature can twist your type in predictable ways that are
not only repeatable but, thanks to the controls in their dialog boxes, customizable as well.
The cool part is that even though type has been warped, it remains fully editable until you
rasterize it. All you need to do to warp your text is click the Warp icon in the Options bar. This
opens the multifaceted Warp Text dialog box, shown in Figure 5-8.
Web developers take note: You cannot warp text that has Faux styles applied (found in the
Character palette).
You’ll find a whole list of special effects, such as Arc, Arch, Bulge, Flag, Wave, Fish, Fisheye,
and Twist. Each of these effects provides a special look to your type, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9
Figure 5-8

Carving Your Type in Stone
365
Each effect has a dialog box of its own that allows you to set the parameters for the amount,
direction, degree of distortion, amount of bend, and so forth. For example, the dialog box for
the Shell Lower style is shown in Figure 5-10.
You can watch your type warp right on-screen and tailor the distortion as you like. You can
apply most asymmetrical warp effects to type in either horizontal or vertical directions.
Fisheye, Inflate, and Twist are among those that can’t be rotated, because their effects are
already oriented in horizontal and vertical directions that you can control with sliders.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Carving Your Type in Stone
You can use the Type tool to create selec-
tions shaped like text and then use images
themselves as textures for the type. For
example, if you were creating a floral-
themed Web page, you could use pictures
of flowers as the fill for your text (shown
in the following example). A type selection
can cut out any part of a picture for use
any way you want.

Follow these steps to carve letters into a
stone texture image:
1.
Open the stone texture image
you’d like to use.
I’m using a photo of a weathered brick
wall in this example, but you can use
other kinds of stone, wood, or any tex-
ture that interests you. Best of all, the
embossed look that results is only one
of many different looks you can
achieve simply by making small
changes in the Layer style that you
apply to the text.
b Choose the Horizontal Type Mask
tool from the Tools palette and
then click in the area where you
want to enter your text.
3.
Choose the font, font style, font
size, and other text parameters
from the drop-down lists in the
Options bar.
4.
Enter the text you want to use into
the texture you’ve chosen (the
center of the brick wall, in my
example). Then click the Commit
button in the Options bar to set
your text (the button has a check
mark icon).
The selection in the shape of the
text appears where you typed the
text.
e Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to
copy the selected area of your
chosen texture (the brick in the
shape of the text in my example),
and then press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the
Mac) to paste a text-shaped section
of that texture in a layer of its own.
The text blends in with what’s in the
background layer (in my example,
the brick) and is invisible (for now).
6.
Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Bevel
and Emboss to open the Layer Style
dialog box.
In the Layer Style dialog box, you’ll
find dozens of different effects that
you can create.
g Experiment with the settings in the
Layer Style dialog box to try out
different looks and to achieve vari-
ous effects.
 Choose the kind of beveling or
embossing you want from the
Style and Technique drop-down
lists in the Structure area of the
dialog box.
I chose Inner Bevel and Chisel
Hard to produce a dramatic,
hard-edged embossing effect.
 Move the Depth slider to the
right to increase the depth of the
bevel.
I set the value at 411% for a
raised effect. A lower value pro-
duces a less 3-D effect, while a
higher value produces a more
drastic 3-D effect.
 Select the Contour check box on
the left side of the dialog box for
an even more pronounced 3-D
look.
 In the Shading area of the dialog
box, you can adjust controls that
allow you to change the appar-
ent angle of the illumination
that produces the bevel’s
shadow.

Working with Layers


P
eople are often surprised and even downright shocked
when I tell them that everything they can do with layers
they can also do without them. Not using layers would be
more technically challenging and a heck of a lot more tedious,
but you could still get the job done. The benefit to using layers
is that you have tremendous flexibility. The changes you make
to the pixels on the individual layers are permanent, but the
interaction between the pixels on different layers is dynamic.
You can make endless edits as long as those layers exist. Layers
make working in Photoshop a lot more forgiving, allowing you
to make changes quickly and productively.
But hey, it’s not just the technical and practical aspects that make
layers so wonderful. Layers also make it easier for you to express
your creative side, allowing you to composite several images into
one, with just a drag of the mouse. The only downside to layers is
that each one makes your file size grow and therefore can start to
slow your system performance. And you can save layers in only a
few file formats. But the downsides are a small price to pay for
something that makes your image-editing life so much easier.
Getting to Know the Layers Palette
In terms of a real-world analogy, think of layers as sheets of
acetate, similar to those clear plastic sheets used with over-
head projectors. You draw different elements on the various
sheets. What you draw on one sheet doesn’t affect the other
sheets. You can show just one sheet, or you can stack several
on top of one another to create a combination image. You can
reshuffle the order of the sheets, add new sheets, or delete old
sheets. Any space on the sheet that doesn’t have a mark on it
is clear, or transparent.
That’s how layers work in Photoshop. You can place elements on
separate layers, yet show them together to create a combination
image, or composite. You can also add, delete, or rearrange

layers. And unlike sheets of acetate, you can also adjust how opaque or transparent the element
on the layer is, as well as change the way the colors between layers interact (blend modes).
Just as with every other important aspect of Photoshop, the program houses layers in a single
location, called a palette. It’s time to formally meet the powerful palette that controls the
operations of layers. To display the palette, shown in Figure 1-1, choose Window➪Layers or,
easier yet, press F7.
The order of the layers in the Layers palette represents the order in the image. The top layer
in the palette is the top layer in your image, and so on.
You can edit only one layer at a time, and that layer is the active layer.
Here’s the lowdown on how to work with the Layers palette:

Select a layer: Simply click its name or thumbnail. Photoshop then highlights the active
layer in the palette and puts a little paintbrush icon to the left of the layer name.

Select the actual element (the non-transparent pixels) on the layer: Ctrl+click (Ô+click
on the Mac) on the layer’s name in the palette. If you forget this handy shortcut, you
can also choose Select➪Load Selection. Make sure that the layer name that appears in
the Channel pop-up menu is [layer name] Transparency and click OK.

Create a new blank layer: Click the Create a New Layer icon at the bottom of the
palette. See the next section for more on creating layers.


Create an adjustment or fill layer: Click the Create a New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon
at the bottom of the palette. See “Introducing Different Types of Layers,” later in this
chapter, for more on these layers.

Duplicate an existing layer: Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the
bottom of the palette. See the next section for more on creating layers.

Rename a layer: When you create a new layer, Photoshop provides default layer names
(Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename a layer, simply double-click the layer
name (the name not the thumbnail) in the Layers palette and enter the name directly in
the Layers palette. This renaming shortcut works throughout Photoshop (the Channels
palette, the Paths palette, and so on). You can also select the layer and choose Layer
Properties from the Layers palette options menu or choose Layer➪Layer Properties.

Determine what layer holds the element you want to edit: Select the Move tool and
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) on the element. Photoshop automatically activates the
appropriate layer. Or you can right-click (Control+click on the Mac) on the element. A
context-sensitive menu appears, telling you what layer the element resides on, and then
enables you to select that layer.
You can use the keyboard shortcut Alt+] (right bracket) (Option+] on the Mac) to move up
one layer; Alt+[ (left bracket) (Option+[ on the Mac) to activate the next layer down. Press
Shift+Alt+] (Shift+Option+] on the Mac) to move to the top layer; press Shift+Alt+[
(Shift+Option+[ on the Mac) to move to the background or bottom layer.

Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the transparency of
layers: You can use the blend modes and the opacity and fill options at the top of the
palette to mix the colors between layers and adjust the transparency of the layers. For
details, see Book V, Chapter 3.

Delete a layer: Drag it to the trash icon at the bottom of the Layers palette. You can also
choose Layer➪Delete➪Layer or choose Delete Layer from the palette options menu.

Change the size of the layer thumbnails: Choose Palette Options from the palette
options menu and select a thumbnail size.
The remaining icons at the bottom of the Layers palette allow you to create layer styles, layer
masks, and layers sets, all of which warrant sections of their own. See Book V, Chapter 4 for
more on layer styles and Book V, Chapter 2 for more on layer sets. Check out Book VI, Chapter 3
for more on layer masks.
The preceding list represents just the tip of the iceberg. You can also view and hide layers,
link, lock, color-code, rearrange, merge, and flatten layers. Again, Book V, Chapter 2 covers
these topics in detail.

Looking at the Background and Layers
When you create a new image with white or background colored contents, scan an image into
Photoshop, or open a file from a stock photography CD, Kodak Photo CD, or your own digital
camera, you basically have a file with just a background.

Book V  Chapter 1: Creating Layers
374
An image contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it. You can’t rearrange the
background in the stack of layers — it’s always on the very bottom of the Layers palette. You
can’t change the opacity or blend mode of a background either. What you can do is convert a
background to a layer, and then the world’s at your feet. It’s no surprise that converting the
background of an image into a layer is a common Photoshop activity.
To convert a background into a layer, follow these steps:
a Double-click Background in the
Layers palette.
In addition, you can choose Layer➪
New➪Layer from Background. Note that
the name Background is italicized in the
Layers palette, as shown in Figure 1-2.
b Name the layer.
You can also color-code your layer by
choosing Layer Properties from the
palette pop-up menu. All this does is
make your layer stand out more notice-
ably in the Layers palette. In addition,
you can group the layer with the previ-
ous layer or change the blend mode,
opacity, or fill settings. For now, leave
all these options at the default settings.
You find out more about these options
in Book V, Chapter 3.
3.
Click OK.
Photoshop converts your background
into a layer, as indicated in the Layers
palette. Note that the layer name
is no longer italicized, as shown in
Figure 1-3.
When you create a new image with trans-
parent contents, the image doesn’t contain
a background but instead is created with a
single layer. You can also convert a layer
into a background by selecting it and then
choosing Layer➪New➪Background from
Layer. Note that this layer is available only
when no background exists and the
bottom-most layer is selected.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
Although turning the background into a layer (discussed in the previous section) is a popular
activity, there’s a reason Photoshop refers to layers in the plural. Image editing would be no
fun if you didn’t have a variety of different layers to mess around with. 
Photoshop offers five types of layers. Four of the five have very specific purposes in the life of
your image. Some you may never use, and some you’ll use only occasionally. But the vanilla-
flavored type, which you’ll use the most, is simply called a layer. Pretty generic, huh? Read on
to find out more.
Using plain-vanilla layers
The regular layer is the one that most closely matches the acetate analogy discussed in the
first section of this chapter. You put various elements on separate layers to create a compos-
ite image. You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can create layers from
images themselves. You can create as many layers as your computer’s RAM will let you. And
sometimes layers are created automatically by a specific action that you execute in
Photoshop.
Because each layer in an image is a separate entity, you can edit, paint, transform, mask, or
apply a filter on a layer without affecting the other layers. And once an element is on a layer,
you no longer have to make a selection (get the selection outline) to select it — you simply drag
the element with the Move tool. The element freely floats in a sea of transparency. Because it’s
impossible to show “clear” areas or transparency on a computer monitor, Photoshop uses a
gray and white checkerboard, by default, to represent the transparent areas of a layer.
Because regular layers are the ones you work with on a daily basis, I spend the majority of the
sections in this chapter and in Book V discussing them.

Using adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used expressly for color correction. What’s great
about adjustment layers is that you can apply that color correction without permanently affect-
ing any of your layers. Adjustment layers apply the correction to all the layers below them (in
the stacking order in the Layers palette), without affecting any of the layers above them.
Because the color correction actually resides on a layer, you can edit, delete, duplicate,
merge, or rearrange the adjustment layer at any time. This gives you more flexibility in your
image-editing chores and more freedom for experimentation.
Photoshop has 12 kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many as your heart desires.
The adjustments offered are the same adjustments you find on the Image➪Adjustments sub-
menu. For specifics on each adjustment and what it corrects, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
Here’s how to create an adjustment layer:
A layer mask is like a second sheet of acetate that
hovers over a layer. You can use layer masks with
regular layers, adjustment layers, and fill layers.
For example, you may paint on a layer mask
(typically with black, white, and various shades of
gray) to selectively hide or display an adjustment
(or an image on a regular layer). Any black areas
on the mask hide the adjustment, any white
areas show the adjustment, and anything in
between (gray) partially shows the adjustment. I
cover layer masks in detail in Book VI, Chapter 3.
Playing around with layer masks
1.
Open an image of your choice.
Because you’re applying an adjustment
layer, you may want to use an image
that is in need of some color correc-
tion. In the case of adjustment layers,
you don’t need to convert your back-
ground into a layer. I chose an image
that was way oversaturated.
2.
Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer.
From the submenu, choose your
desired adjustment. Name the layer
if you want, leave the other options
at their defaults, and click OK.
For my example, I chose Hue/Saturation.
You can also just click the Create a New
Fill or Adjustment Layer icon (the black
and white circle icon) at the bottom of
the Layers palette and choose an
adjustment from the pop-up menu.
The dialog box pertaining to your
adjustment appears.
3.
Make the necessary corrections and
click OK.
After you close the dialog box, the
adjustment layer appears in the Layers
palette. Two thumbnails appear on the
adjustment layer. The thumbnail on the
left represents the actual adjustment.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
377
Editing adjustment layers
After you’ve created an adjustment layer, you can easily edit it. Simply double-click the adjust-
ment layer thumbnail in the Layers palette or choose Layer➪Layer Content Options. In the
dialog box that appears, make any edits and then click OK. The only adjustment layer that you
cannot edit is the Invert adjustment. It is either totally on or totally off.

The thumbnail on the right represents
a layer mask, as shown in Figure 1-4.
For more on layer masks, check out
the “Playing around with layer masks”
sidebar.
In my example, the layer mask is all
white, as shown in Figure 1-4, so my
adjustment shows up full strength over
my image. Like regular layers, you can
adjust the opacity, fill, and blend
modes of an adjustment layer. For
more on these options, see Book V,
Chapter 3.
If you want to view your image without
the adjustment, click the eye icon in the
far-left column of the Layers palette to
hide the adjustment layer. You can find
more on viewing layers in Book V,
Chapter 2. If you want to delete the
adjustment layer, simply drag it to the
trash can icon in the Layers palette or
choose Delete from the Layer menu or
Layers palette options menu.

Book V  Chapter 1: Creating Layers
378
To change the content of an adjustment layer, choose Layer➪Change Layer Content and select
a different adjustment layer from the submenu. Editing and changing the content works the
exact same way for fill layers (which are discussed in an upcoming section).
Isolating your adjustments
If you don’t use an adjustment layer when you make color corrections, the correction you
apply affects only the active layer (the layer highlighted in the Layers palette). This may be
the way to go if you want to just tweak the color on a single layer.
Here are some tips for using and isolating adjustment layers:

Correct part (but not all) of a layer: To enable the adjustment layer to correct only a
portion of a layer, make a selection before you create the adjustment layer. The adjust-
ment affects only the pixels within the selection outline.
This is referring to the pixels within the selection outline on each layer that resides below
the adjustment layer. In addition to making a selection, you can also create and select a
closed path (see Book III, Chapter 2 for more on paths).

Create a clipping group: When you create a clipping group of the layers you want to
adjust, you can place the adjustment layer in or at the bottom of the clipping group,
and it will affect only those clipped layers. In a clipping group, the bottommost layer acts
as a mask for the layers in the group. For more on clipping groups, see Book V, Chapter 4.

Create a layer set: You can create a layer set (a grouping of layers, as described in
Book V, Chapter 2) and place the layers you want adjusted in that set. Then make sure
that the blend mode is set to any mode except Pass Through. For more on modes, see
Book V, Chapter 3.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Taking advantage of fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like adjustment layers, fill
layers also have layer masks, as indicated by the mask icon thumbnail in the Layers palette.
You can create as many fill layers as you like, just as you can with regular layers and adjust-
ment layers. You can also edit, rearrange, duplicate, delete, and merge fill layers. And you can
blend fill layers with other layers by using the opacity, fill, and blend mode options (described
in Book V, Chapter 3) in the Layers palette.
You can also confine fill layers in the same ways I mention in the preceding section,
“Isolating your adjustments.”
Like an adjustment layer, to confine the effects of a fill layer to a portion of the image, make
a selection or create and select a closed path before you create the fill layer (see Book III,
Chapter 2 for more on paths). And editing or changing the contents of a fill layer is similar to
editing or changing the contents of an adjustment layer (see the preceding section for details).

Introducing Different Types of Layers
379
Here’s how to create a fill layer:
Book
V
Chapter
1
1.
Open an image of your choice.
In this case, open an image that would
look good with a cool border or cool
type. For my example, I created the
word fujiyama by using the Horizontal
Type Mask tool (for details, see Book
IV, Chapter 4). If you want to create
a simple border, you can just create a
rectangle along one of the sides of
your image. If you don’t have an active
selection, the fill layer encompasses
your entire canvas.
2.
Choose Layer➪New Fill Layer. From
the submenu, choose your desired
adjustment. Name the layer, leave the
other options at their defaults, and
click OK.
For my example, I chose Pattern from
the submenu.
You can also just click the Create a
New Fill or Adjustment Layer icon
(the black and white circle icon) at
the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose a fill from the pop-up menu.
The dialog box pertaining to your fill
appears.
c Follow the steps that correspond with
the option you chose in Step 2:
 Solid Color: Choose your desired
color from the Photoshop Color
Picker. (For more on color, see Book
II, Chapter 3.)
 Gradient: Choose a preset gradient
from the pop-up palette or click
the gradient preview to display
the Gradient Editor to create
your own gradient. Set additional
gradient options as desired. (For
gradient details, see Book IV,
Chapter 3.)
 Pattern: Select a pattern from the
pop-up palette. Click Scale and
enter a value or drag the scale
slider. I scaled my bubble pattern
250%. Click Snap to Origin to posi-
tion the origin of the pattern with
the document window. Finally,
select the Link with Layer option
to specify that the pattern moves
with the fill layer if you move it.
I chose Pattern in my example in
Figure 1-5.
d Click OK.
After you close the dialog box, the fill
layer appears in the Layers palette,
as shown in Figure 1-6. Similar to
adjustment layers, you’ll notice the
layer mask that was created on the
fill layer. In my example, the word
fujiyama appears white on the layer
mask, thereby allowing my pattern
to show through. The remaining
areas are black, hiding my pattern.
Again, if you want to know more
about layer masks, see Book VI,
Chapter 3. I added a couple of Layer
Styles (Drop Shadow and Inner Bevel)
to my type to jazz it up a bit. If you
want to do the same, jump ahead to
Book V, Chapter 4.
If you want to delete the fill layer, do
one of three things: Drag it to the trash
can icon in the Layers palette; choose
Delete from the Layer menu; or choose
Delete Layer from the Layers palette
options menu.
One final note. You can also rasterize a
fill layer to convert it to a regular raster
image. Choose Layer➪Rasterize➪
Fill Content. This will enable you
to use painting tools or filters on the 
layer.

Making use of shape layers
In Version 6, Photoshop expanded its repertoire from just painting and added a whole slew of
shape drawing tools — six to be exact. You can fill those shapes with solid color, gradients, or
4

Figure 1-5

Introducing Different Types of Layers
381
patterns. When you create a shape, it resides on its own unique shape layer. A shape layer
contains a vector mask, similar in concept to the adjustment layer mask described earlier.
If you look at the Layers palette, you can see that the Shape layer has two thumbnails: One is
entirely filled with color, and the other contains the path of the shape, as shown in Figure 1-7.
To state it simply, the color is peeking through the path of the shape, and the rest of the layer
is hidden or masked. The paths that comprise a shape are vector paths; when printed, they
retain their smooth curves without the jagged edges you often see from bitmap editing pro-
grams. Although you can edit, move, and transform shapes, your ability to edit shape layers
is limited. To apply filters and other special effects, you must first rasterize the shape layers —
that is, convert the vector paths to pixels. For more details on shapes, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
You can also create shape layers with the Pen tool. For more on the Pen tool, see Book III,
Chapter 2.
Using type layers
To create type, click your canvas with the Type tool (horizontal or vertical) and type your
desired text. After you commit your text by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad or clicking
the Commit button on the Options bar (it looks like a check mark), you’ve created a type layer.
In the Layers palette, you see a layer with a T icon, indicating that it’s a type layer. The name of
the type layer corresponds to the text you typed. Like shapes, the text in Photoshop is true
vector type and, if left in that format, always prints smooth and without the jaggies.
Another great thing about type in Photoshop is that it is live; you can edit the text at any time.
You can also change the orientation, apply anti-aliasing (softening of the edges), create paths
from the type, and even warp it into various distortions, as in my example in Figure 1-8. You
can also convert the type to a shape. And like regular layers, you can move, rearrange, copy,
and change the layer options (opacity, fill, and mode) of a type layer. If, however, you want to
apply certain special effects, such as filters, you must first rasterize (convert into pixels) the
text. For everything you need to know about type, see Book IV, Chapters 4 and 5.

Making Layers
As I mention earlier in the chapter, good, old-fashioned, regular layers are the backbone of the
world of layers. The next few sections take a look at the various ways to create these layers.
Creating a new layer
If you want to create a new blank layer, click the Create a New Layer icon at the bottom of the
Layers palette. You can also create a new layer by choosing New Layer from the palette options
menu or by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer. The latter method prompts you with a dialog box to
name your layer and includes other options for grouping, color-coding, blending, and opacity
(all of which are explained in other chapters in Book V). Provide a name for your layer and click
OK. If you chose one of the first two methods, a layer with the default name of Layer 1 appears
in the Layers palette.
You can also create an entirely new document with a layer by choosing File➪New. In the New
dialog box, select the Transparent for the Contents option. Your new file then appears with
Layer 0 instead of a background.
When you click the Create a New Layer icon, the layer is added above your active layer. By
holding down the Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac) when you click, Photoshop adds the new layer
below the active layer.
Your new transparent layer is now ready for content. Remember, because it isn’t possible to
show transparency on your screen, Photoshop uses a gray-and-white checkerboard to repre-
sent the transparent areas of a layer. You can put content on the new layer in several ways:

Use one of the painting tools and paint directly on the layer.

Make a selection on another layer or the background (for the difference between the
two, see the previous sections in this chapter) within the same document or from
Type layer
Figure 1-8

Making Layers
383
another image entirely and then choose Edit➪Copy. Select your new blank layer in the
Layers palette and then choose Edit➪Paste.

Make a selection on another layer (or the background) within the same document or
from another image and then choose Edit➪Cut. Select your new blank layer and then
choose Edit➪Paste. Just remember that Photoshop deletes the selection from the
source and adds it to your new layer, as shown in Figure 1-9.

Transfer an entire image to your new layer by choosing Select➪All and then either
Edit➪Copy or Edit➪Cut. Select your new blank layer and then choose Edit➪Paste.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy command found on the Layer
menu. Make a selection on a layer or background and choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
The copied selection is placed on a new layer with the default name of Layer 1. You can do
the same with the Layer via Cut command, but in this case, Photoshop deletes the selected
area from the source layer or background and places it on the new layer. The source layer
Figure 1-9
Book
V
Chapter
1

Book V  Chapter 1: Creating Layers
384
is left with a gaping transparent hole. If you used the background for the source, your back-
ground color fills the space, as shown in Figure 1-10. Remember that you can use these two
commands only within the same image. You cannot use them between multiple images.
Duplicating layers
If you want to duplicate an existing layer, first select it in the Layers palette. Then drag the
layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the bottom of the palette. You can also duplicate a
layer by choosing Duplicate Layer from the palette options menu or by choosing Layer➪
Duplicate Layer. Like with creating a new layer, the latter method prompts you with a dialog
box to name your layer and includes other options. Provide a name for your layer and click
OK. If you chose either of the first two methods, Photoshop provides the default name of
the original layer with Copy appended to the name. Duplicating layers can be especially
handy when you want to experiment with a special effect but don’t want to harm your
original image.
Compositing with Multiple Images
Often when working with layers, you are not confined to using a single image. I mean, there’s
only so much you can do to that family portrait taken down at the local photo studio. But take
your family and put them in front of the ruins at Machu Picchu or the summit at Mount
Everest (you can even add faux snow with a technique shown in Book VII), and we’re talking
about endless hours of fun. When you get the hang of working with several images, you’ll find
that it opens a whole new door of creative possibilities. And you’re not limited to just plain
old snapshots. You can incorporate type, vector illustrations, and scans of just about anything
you can place on a scanning bed. Apply some layer styles, maybe a filter or two (see Book
VII), and you’ve got an image worthy of some major wall space.
Figure 1-10

Compositing with Multiple Images
385
Copying and pasting images
Earlier in the “Making Layers” section, I explain how to use the Copy, Cut, and Paste com-
mands within the same image or between two different images when you want to fill a new
blank layer with content. You can also use the Copy and Paste commands without having a
blank layer first. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer, Photoshop auto-
matically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. You can go about your merry way and
perform all your layer creation by using only those commands. However, I rarely use them
when working with multiple images. I prefer the drag-and-drop method described next.
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all the visible
layers within the selection.
Dragging and dropping layers
To copy an entire layer from one document to another, simply select the layer in the Layers
palette, grab the Move tool, press your mouse button down, and drag and drop that image onto
your destination document. Photoshop automatically introduces the dropped layer as a new
layer above the active layer in the image. You don’t need to have a selection outline to copy
the entire layer. However, if you want to copy just a portion of the layer, make your desired
selection, as shown in Figure 1-11, before you drag and drop with the Move tool. If you want the
selected element to be centered on the destination image, hold down the Shift key as you drag
and drop. See the sidebar, “Bypassing the clipboard,” for more on dragging and dropping.

Using the Paste Into command
You may occasionally want to place an image on a separate layer, yet have it fill a selection.
That’s where the Edit➪Paste Into command comes into play. This command enables you to
insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection outline.
For example, if you want to make it appear as if a snake is poking its head out of the opening
of a cave, or a possum is emerging from a trash can, Paste Into is your command. It’s hard to
visualize this description unless you actually do it, so be sure to check out the Putting-It-
Together project in this chapter.
Follow these steps to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection outline:
1.
Make the selection on the layer that
you want the image to fill.
I’ll call this the destination layer.
2.
Select the image that will fill that
selection.
I’ll call this the source image.
Note: The source image can be within
the same image or from another image.
3.
Choose Edit➪Copy.
4.
Return to the destination layer and
choose Edit➪Paste Into.
Photoshop converts the selection out-
line on the destination layer into a
layer mask. The pasted selection is vis-
ible only inside the selection outline,
like it is peeking out of a hole. For a
brief description of layer masks, see
the “Using adjustment layers” section,
earlier in this chapter. For a detailed
explanation, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
Transforming Layers
When compositing multiple images, you will no doubt have to scale some of your image to fit
into your layout. Fortunately, Photoshop makes this an easy chore by providing you with the
Transform and Free Transform commands found on the Edit menu. Transforming layers is almost
identical to transforming selections except that you don’t need to make a selection first. After an
element is on a layer, you can just choose the appropriate transformation command and off you
go. In addition, you can apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously if you link the
layers first. For more on linking layers, see Book V, Chapter 2. Because I explain each transforma-
tion in excruciating detail in Book III, Chapter 3, check that out if you need more detail.
In addition to transforming individual layers and selections, you can also transform the entire
image. You find these commands — Image Size (for scaling) and Rotate Canvas — on the
Image menu. For details on these commands, see Book II, Chapter 1.
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Don’t go back numerous times and
apply various transformations. Each time you transform pixels, you are putting your image
through the interpolation process (manufacturing pixels). Done repeatedly, your image may
start to turn into mush. And if not mush, it will not be as pristine and crisp as it was before.

Transforming Layers
387
If your image looks jagged after you transform it, you may have your preferences set incorrectly
for your interpolation method. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (Photoshop➪Preferences➪
General on Mac OS X) and select the Bicubic (Better) option from the Interpolation drop-down
list. This enables a smoother appearance to your interpolated pixels.
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing a command. Simply
select the Show Bounding Box option in the Options bar. This option surrounds the contents
(or an active selection) of the layer with a bounding box with handles, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Drag these handles to transform the contents.
Transform box

Yes, you can always cut and paste or copy and
paste a layer from one image to another, but I
prefer to drag and drop rather than copy and
paste between two images. By dragging and
dropping, you bypass the temporary storage area
for copied and stored data, the clipboard.
(Whenever you copy or cut a selection, Photoshop
stores the selection on the clipboard until you are
ready to paste it to its new home.) So what’s
wrong with that? Well, nothing, unless you’re
working with high-resolution images. Storing
images on the clipboard, even on a temporary
basis, can slow down your system. Keeping your
clipboard clear of data ensures that Photoshop is
running lean and mean so that you can drag and
drop more images, selections, and layers quicker
and more efficiently. Take my advice and try the
drag-and-drop method. I guarantee that, like me,
you’ll be flexing your trigger finger — all the better
to drag and drop even faster.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Creating Layers and Using the Paste Into Command to Make a Collage
If you remember your elementary-school
days, you probably remember cutting out
a bunch of pictures from magazines and
pasting them on a piece of construction
paper. Well, with Photoshop, the idea of a
collage isn’t much different, but the activ-
ity is a little more refined.
Maybe you want to let loose your artistic
side. Or maybe you need to combine sev-
eral images into one as part of a job. Or you
may just want to get a better handle on
how layers work. Whatever your reason,
you can use the steps you find here to get
started on your first collage. And by the
way, if collage is too froufrou a word for
you, you can substitute it with composite —
as in the definition of “derived from many
components.” I usually do.
Creating a collage takes many steps.
Throughout Book V, you find several
ongoing Putting-It-Together projects, all
of which lead you to a finished collage.
Be sure to save your collage file so that
you can work on it as you make your
way through this book.

What makes a collage a collage is the fact
that you layer a variety of images over
each other. So it makes sense that you
need to understand how layers work in
order to get started. I discuss layers
throughout Book V. To create the first
layer of your collage, follow these steps:
a Decide on two images you want to
use in your collage and open them
by choosing File➪Open.
I recommend picking an image to
use as your main canvas and then
opening up a supporting image that
you can select and then drag onto
that main image. However, if you
want, you can also start with just
a blank document. For my example,
I decided on a travel theme and
opened an image of the Grand
Canyon and another image of a 
passport.
2.
Choose Window➪Layers to open
the Layers palette.
Always be sure that the Layers
palette is visible whenever you’re
creating a composite from multiple
images. You need to see what is hap-
pening as you drag and drop, and
you need to be aware of what layer
you are working on at all times.
c Select the desired element in the
supporting image.
Feel free to use whatever selection
method suits your fancy, but
remember, the finished collage
will look only as good as its individ-
ual selections. For more on making
selections, see Book III.

Because the contrast between my
passport and the background behind
it was very good, I grabbed the Magic
Wand tool, set the Tolerance to 50,
and clicked the passport. I then held
down the Shift key and, with the
Lasso tool, circled the remaining
pixels in the gold type that the Magic
Wand tool didn’t pick up.
To add a selection, you must press and
hold down the Shift key.
4.
Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract
and enter a value. Then choose
Select➪Feather and enter a value.
Contract the selections lightly (I
chose a value of 1 pixel) before you
apply a feather (I chose a 0.5 pixel
value) to avoid picking up some of
the background during the feather-
ing process.
Using a small feather helps to avoid
the harsh, looks-like-I-cut-it-out-with-a-
pair-of-pinking-shears look.
e With the Move tool, drag and drop
the selection onto the background.
The Layers palette shows that
you’ve produced a layer. You’ll
notice that your main image remains
as the background below the layer.
Don’t worry if your element isn’t the
right size. You can find a Putting-It-
Together project in Book V, Chapter 2,
that shows you how to scale the layer.
6.
Choose File➪Save. Name the file
collage and make sure the format
is Photoshop.
Keep the file in a handy spot on
your hard drive so that you can find
it when you’re ready to do more
with your collage.

I’ve already shown you how to create a
layer by dragging and dropping a passport
onto a background image of the Grand
Canyon. The process I’m demonstrating
here is a little different. It entails pasting
one selection into another.
Sticking with my travel theme, I opted to
take the image of a compass and paste it
into the background so that the compass
looks like it’s peaking out from the side of
the canyon.

To paste one selection into another on
your collage, follow these steps:
1.
Choose File➪Open. Select the file
you saved from the last exercise.
Also open a new supporting image.
2.
Choose Window➪Layers to open
the Layers palette.
Always keep the Layers palette visible
whenever you are creating a composite
from multiple images.
c Select the part of the supporting
image that you want to use.
Feel free to use whatever selection
method you desire, but try to get as
accurate a selection as you can.
For the compass, I used the
Elliptical Marquee tool, while press-
ing the Alt key (Option on the Mac),
to draw from the center out to
select the bottom portion of the
compass. With the same tool, I
pressed the Shift key and then the
mouse button and then the Alt key
(Option) to add the top portion of
the compass.
If the Alt (Option) and Shift keyboard
commands are fuzzy to you, check out
Book III, Chapter 3.
4.
Contract and feather the selection
(as described in Step 4 in the previ-
ous set of steps).
Unless you’re going for some special
effect, be consistent with the treat-
ment of the edges of each of your
elements in your composite. See
Book III for more on selections.
5.
Choose Edit➪Copy.
f In your saved collage file, move the
first supporting image (the image
you added in the previous set of
steps) to the side with the Move
tool. Then use the Lasso tool (or
any other selection tool) to create a
selection in which to paste your
new supporting image.
I want the compass image to look as
if it is peeking up from behind the
side of the canyon, so I made a
selection in the cliffs of the Grand
Canyon.
g Choose Edit➪Paste Into.
If you use the Move tool to move the
pasted image around the canvas,
you see that the pasted image is
invisible outside the boundaries of
the selection outline.
Don’t be concerned if your element
isn’t the right size. I show you how
to scale your layer in Book V,
Chapter 2.
The Layers palette shows a second
thumbnail next to the compass
thumbnail. This thumbnail repre-
sents the layer mask created auto-
matically when you pasted into a
selection. A layer mask allows por-
tions of the layer to show and be
hidden. In my example, the white
areas on the layer mask are where
my compass shows through. Those
white areas happen to correspond
to the selection I made in Step 6.
The black areas represent where my
compass would be hidden if I were
to move it into those areas. For
more on layer masks, see Book VI,
Chapter 3.

H
opefully, you had the time and inclination to check out
the first chapter of Book V. That’s where you get all the
basic information on creating layers. In this chapter, you
get the scoop on how to manage the layers you’ve created. And
unlike some coworkers, clients, or family members, layers are
downright agreeable to being managed, even micromanaged for
that matter. The beauty of layers is that they’re so darn easy to
get along with. You can hide them, shuffle them around, link
and lock them, herd them into sets, and even smush them
together into one loving, collective layer. Yes, Photoshop has a
whole slew of ways to get your layers in the orderly and organ-
ized fashion you deserve.
Viewing and Hiding Layers
Often, it’s useful to hide all the layers in your image except for
the one you want to edit. You can focus on the element at hand
without the distraction of all the other components of the
image. You can do this with a single quick click of the mouse
button, as described in the following list:

Hide all the layers but one: Select the layer you want to
display. Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) on the eye
icon for that layer, in the far-left column of the Layers
palette. To redisplay all the layers, Alt+click (Option+
click on the Mac) on the eye icon again.

Hide an individual layer: Click the eye icon for that
layer, as shown in Figure 2-1. To redisplay the layer, click
the blank space in the eye column.
You can also hide layer styles or entire layer sets by using the
same method as with layers. You can find out more about layer
sets later in this chapter. For the lowdown on layer styles, see
Book V, Chapter 4.

Only layers that are visible will print. This can be useful if you want to have several versions
(each on a separate layer) of an image for a project within the same document. You can view
selective layers, print them, get approval from the powers that be, and then delete the layers
with the scrapped versions. Only one file to manage — even I can handle that.
If clicking is just too strenuous for you, try this neat trick. Drag through the eye column to
hide or display multiple layers in one fell swoop. Now that’s technology.
Rearranging Layers
If you read my analogy in Book V, Chapter 1, comparing layers to sheets of acetate used with
overhead projectors, it will make sense to you when I say that you can shuffle the order of
layers like, well, sheets of acetate. The stacking order of the layers in the Layers palette corre-
sponds to the order of the layers in the document. If you want to move a layer to another
position in the stacking order, drag the layer (or layer set) up or down in the Layers palette.
As you drag, you will see a fist icon. Release your mouse button when a highlighted line
appears where you want to insert the layer.
Visible layer
Hidden layer
Figure 2-1

Moving Layer Elements
395
Alternatively, you can change the order by selecting the layer (or layer set) and then choosing
Layer➪Arrange. Then select one of the following commands from the submenu:

Bring to Front and Send to Back send the layer to the very top or very bottom of the
stacking order.

Bring Forward and Send Backward move the layer one level up or down.
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. If you need to
move the background, first convert it to a layer by double-clicking the name in the Layers
palette. Enter a name for the layer and click OK.
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging layers is different from moving the content on the layer. Because the elements on
a layer are free floating on a bed of transparency, it’s a piece of cake to move the element
whenever necessary. Moving the element has no effect on any of the other layers, and it
doesn’t harm the image one iota.
To move an image on a layer, just drag it with the Move tool, the four-headed arrow tool
located in the Toolbox (more formally known as the Tools palette); it doesn’t get any simpler
than that. Here are a few more handy tips when moving an image and using the Move tool:

Move the layer in 1-pixel increments: Press an arrow key with the Move tool selected.
To move the layer in 10-pixel increments, press Shift as you press the arrow key.

Find out what layer holds the element you want to move (or edit in some other way):
Select the Move tool and Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) on the element. Photoshop auto-
matically activates the layer the element resides on. Or you can right-click (Control+click
on the Mac) on the element. A context menu appears, telling you what layer the element
resides on, and then enables you to select that layer from the context menu.
This technique works only on pixels that have an opacity of 50% or more. If you click pixels
with opacities of 50% or less, Photoshop burrows down into successive layers and selects the
first layer below on which it encounters a pixel with an opacity of 50% or more.

Switch to a layer when you click with the Move tool on any part of a layer: Select the
Auto Select Layer option on the Options bar. But be careful if you use this option; you
may inadvertently select a layer when you don’t want to.

Display a bounding box around the elements on your layer: Select the Show Bounding
Box check box in the Options bar. This can be useful if all your elements are melting
into one another in an indistinguishable conglomeration.
To temporarily access the Move tool, Ctrl+drag (Ô+drag on the Mac) with any other tool
except the Pen tools, the Hand tool, the Slice and Slice Select tools, the Path Selection tool,
the Direct Selection tool, and any of the Shape tools. Release the Ctrl (Ô) key to return to
your original tool.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Transforming and Moving Layers in a Collage
When you have a couple of images in your
collage (see the Putting-It-Together proj-
ects in Book V, Chapter 1), you can start
transforming them to your liking. Moving
and scaling are the manipulations you’ll
probably do the most. Photoshop enables
you to transform layers without affecting
any other layer within the image. (For
more on transformations, see Book V,
Chapter 1, and Book III, Chapter 3.)
Here’s how to tweak images:
a Choose File➪Open. Select your
saved collage file.
2.
Choose Window➪Layers to open
the Layers palette.
3.
In the Layers palette, select the
layer you want to transform.
In my example, I chose the layer
that has the passport on it.
4.
Choose Edit➪Free Transform.
Because you’re going to adjust the
scale and rotate the image at the
same time, choose Free Transform
rather than Transform. Then choose
a transformation type from the sub-
menu. This way you are interpolat-
ing the image only once, rather than
twice. For more on interpolation,
see Book II, Chapter 1.
5.
Shift+drag a corner transformation
handle to scale the image down to
the desired size.
Pressing the Shift key when you
drag maintains the relative propor-
tions of the image and reduces the
amount of distortion.
I reduced the passport in my
example to about half its origi-
nal size.

6.
Position the cursor just outside
the handle until a curved arrow
appears. Rotate the image the
desired amount.
In my example, I rotated the pass-
port approximately 45 degrees.
g When you’ve transformed the
selection to your liking, double-
click inside the transform box or
press Enter (Return on the Mac).
The transform box disappears.
Avoid as much interpolation as
possible to ensure less quality
degradation.
8.
To transform a selection that is on
a layer mask, in the Layers palette
choose the selection’s layer and
follow Steps 4 through 7.
In my example, that’s the compass
layer.
Be sure to click the selection’s
thumbnail and not the layer mask
thumbnail. Otherwise, you’ll trans-
form the layer mask thumbnail
instead of the selection.
i When you’ve transformed the
selection to your liking, double-
click inside the transform box.
I scaled the compass slightly so that
the top portion of the compass
became visible. Then I rotated the
compass to show more of the com-
pass face rather than the cover.

You probably already have a pretty good
sense of the possibilities (which are infi-
nite) available to you when you create and
change collages. Of course, you can
always add more stuff to a collage, and
you can also rearrange the layers as
needed. Just follow these steps:
1.
Choose File➪Open and then select
your collage file. Also open
another supporting image.
I chose a boarding pass image.
2.
Choose Window➪Layers to open
the Layers palette if it isn’t already
visible.
3.
Select the desired element in the
supporting image.
It goes without saying that making
the selection accurate can only
enhance your composite. I selected
the boarding pass with the Polygon
Lasso tool.
4.
Contract and feather the image’s
edges and use the Move tool to
drag the selection into the collage
file.
For the most professional appear-
ance possible, make sure that the
values you use are consistent with
the values you chose when you
modified and feathered all the other
selections in this composite.
e Position and transform the selec-
tion as needed.
Follow the directions provided in
the preceding steps list.
In my example, I scaled the boarding
pass to the same size as the passport,
rotated it clockwise, and positioned it
a little lower than the passport.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
If you are as precise as I am, you’ll appreciate Photoshop’s ability to align and distribute your
layers. These commands can be especially useful when you need to align items such as navi-
gation buttons on a Web page or a row of headshots for a corporate publication.
Here are the steps to align and distribute your layers:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the
anchor layer that you want all the
other layers to align to.
The selected anchor layer will remain
stationary, and the other layers will
align to the anchor.
2.
Link the layers you want to align.
In the Layers palette, click the second
column from the left (next to the eye
column) to display the link icon, as
shown in Figure 2-2. (For more on link-
ing, see the next section.)
3.
Choose Layer➪Align Linked and
select one of the alignment com-
mands.
Photoshop provides you with handy
little icons that illustrate the various
alignment types. You will also find
these icons as buttons in the Options
bar when you have the Move tool
selected, as shown in Figure 2-2. Feel
free to use either method.
4.
In the Layers palette, link three
or more layers that you want to
distribute.
This command evenly spaces the
layers between the first and last ele-
ments in either the row or column.
5.
Choose Layer➪Distribute Linked and
select one of the distribute com-
mands, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Again for the word-challenged, there
is an icon illustrating the distribution
types. And like alignment, you will
also find the distribute icons as but-
tons in the Options bar when you
have the Move tool selected.
You can also align a layer (or linked
layers) to a selection outline. First,
make your desired selection in the
image. Then select a layer or linked
layers in the Layers palette. Choose
Layer➪Align to Selection and choose a
command from the submenu. Note
that the Align to Selection command 
doesn’t appear in the Layer menu until
you have both linked layers and an
active selection outline.
The alignment and distribution commands
work only on layers with an opacity
greater than 50 percent. For more on
opacity, see Book V, Chapter 3.

Linking Layers
In the preceding section, you find out how to link layers to align and distribute them. Linking
layers temporarily groups two or more layers and allows you to perform a multitude of com-
mands to those layers as a unit, as described in the following list:

Move linked layers: Just drag with the Move tool, and elements on the linked layers
move together.

Drag linked layers into another document: See Book V, Chapter 1, for more on
dragging.

Merge linked layers: See “Flattening and Merging Layers,” later in this chapter, for more
on merging.

Apply transformations: See Book V, Chapter 1 and Book III, Chapter 3 for details on
transformations.

Create a new layer set: See “Creating Layer Sets,” later in this chapter.

Create clipping groups: See Book V, Chapter 4 for info on clipping groups.

Delete linked layers: Select any one of the layers in the group and Ctrl+click (Ô+click
on the Mac) the trash can icon in the Layers palette. Or choose Layer➪Delete➪
Linked Layers.

Delete hidden layers: Choose Layer➪Delete➪Hidden Layers.
To link layers, follow these short steps:
1.
Select a layer or layer set in the
Layers palette.
This is your active layer. Next, you link
the other layers to it.
2.
Click in the second column from the
left (next to the eye column) on the
layer you want to link.
A link icon appears in the column.
Repeat this step for any other layers
you want to link.
To remove a link, click the link icon.
To link and unlink multiple layers in a
single flick of the wrist, drag your mouse
up and down the link column. To unlink
all the layers at once, Alt+click (Option+
click on the Mac) the paintbrush icon in
the link column.

Linking Layers in a Collage and Adjusting Their Size

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Linking Layers in a Collage and Adjusting Their Size
When you’re working on composites, you
may find the need to adjust the size or angle
of more than one layer. You can link the
layers you want to scale or rotate and trans-
form all the layers at the same time. This
strategy enables you to adjust all the layers
the same amount at the same time — thus
ensuring that they stay proportional in size.
In addition, linking layers can come in handy
when you want to align and distribute layers
evenly or if you want to merge several layers
into one to save file space (both techniques
are described in this chapter).
1.
Open your saved collage file.
Make sure that the Layers palette is
visible.
2.
Select a layer.
In my example, I selected Layer 1.
3.
In the Layers palette, click in the
second column (just to the right of
the eye) next to a different layer.
I clicked the middle column for
Layer 3.
A chain link icon appears. You’ve
just linked two layers (such as
Layers 1 and 3).
4.
Choose Edit➪Free Transform and
Shift+drag the corner transforma-
tion handle to scale the layers.
When you’re satisfied, double-click
inside the transform box or press
Enter (Return on the Mac).
Because the images are linked, any
transformation you apply, including
moving and scaling, affects all the
linked layers.
5.
Save the file when you’re done.
To unlink layers, click the link icon.
In my example, the link icon appears
on Layer 3.

Locking Layers
After you get your layers the way you want them, you may want to lock them to prevent them
from being changed. To lock a layer, select it in the Layers palette and select one or more of
the lock options at the top of the Layers palette, as shown from left to right in Figure 2-4:

Lock Transparent Pixels: Prevents you from painting or editing any transparent areas
on your layer. To quickly select or deselect the Lock Transparent Pixels check box,
press the forward slash key (/).

Lock Image Pixels: Prevents you from painting or editing your layer. You can still select,
move, or transform items on the layer.

Lock Position: Prevents you from moving and transforming the layer but gives you free
rein on everything else.

Lock All: Prevents you from painting, editing, moving, or transforming your layer. (But
you can still make selections.)
When you select the Lock All option, a solid lock icon appears on the layer, indicating the
layer is fully locked. When you select any of the other lock options, the lock appears hollow,
indicating the layer is partially locked.
By default, the background is locked and cannot be unlocked until you convert the back-
ground into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. In addition, by default,
type layers have the Lock Transparent Pixels and Lock Image Pixels options selected. These
options are grayed out and cannot be deselected. However, if you need to paint on the type
layer, you can always rasterize it, thereby removing all locking options. For more on type, see
Book IV, Chapter 4.
In addition, you can lock layer sets. Choose Lock All Layers in Set from the Layers palette pop-
up menu or choose Layer➪Lock All Layers in Set. For more on sets, see “Creating Layer Sets,”
later in this chapter.
You can also lock your linked layers. Select the linked layers (or linked set) and then either
choose Lock All Linked Layers from the Layers palette pop-up menu or choose Layer➪Lock
All Linked Layers. In the dialog box that appears, select which items you want to lock.

Creating Layer Sets

Color-Coding Layers
To visually distinguish your layers in the Layers palette, Photoshop lets you color-code your
layers or layer sets, as shown in Figure 2-5. Choose Layer➪Layer Properties or choose Layer
Properties from the Layers palette pop-up menu. Choose a color from the drop-down list and
click OK. 
I find that color-coding works especially well with layer sets. First, organize your layers into
sets, such as navigation buttons, type, images, border, background, and so on. Then assign a
color to each set. By using the same color-coding system from one project to the next, you
can get a little productivity boost by instinctively knowing where to find your elements.
Creating Layer Sets
I don’t know about you, but there’s something very satisfying about having a file cabinet full of
neatly labeled manila folders containing all your vital paperwork. It’s compact. It’s organized.
It’s “at the ready,” as they say in the military. Okay, so I need to get a life. But fellow geeks will
revel in Photoshop’s digital answer to the physical world’s manila folder. You can group your
layers into layer sets that you can expand to see or collapse to hide their contents. In their col-
lapsed state, layer sets are a great antidote for the annoying scrolling that one must do to
locate layers in an abundantly layered file.
To create a layer set, click the Create a New Set icon (the folder icon) at the bottom of the
Layers palette, shown in Figure 2-6. You can also choose New Layer Set from the Layers
palette pop-up menu or choose Layer➪New➪Layer Set. The latter two methods prompt you
for a set name in addition to a few other options (similar to regular layers). You can color-
code your set and specify a blend mode and opacity setting. Note that the default mode is
Pass Through, which lets the blend modes applied to the individual layers remain intact.
If you choose any other mode, it overrides all the layers in the set.
Figure 2-5

Chapter

Book V  Chapter 2: Managing Layers
406
After you have created your set, drag your layers into the set folder in the Layers palette. If
the set is collapsed when you drag or if you drag a layer on top of the layer set icon itself,
Photoshop places the layer at the bottom of the layer set. If the set is expanded, you can drag
the layer to a specific location within the set. To collapse or expand the set, click the triangle
icon to the left of the folder icon.
Although layer sets are pretty straightforward, here are a few points to keep in mind:

As with regular layers, you can select, duplicate, show, hide, lock, and rearrange layer
sets. See other sections in this chapter for more on these commands.

You can now nest layer sets. This means that one layer set can be created (or dragged
into) in another layer set.
Photoshop CS supports up to five levels of nested layer sets.

You can create a layer set from linked layers. Link the layers you want in a set and
choose New Set from Linked from the Layers palette pop-up menu or choose
Layer➪New➪Layer Set from Linked. Name the set and click OK.

If you select a layer within a set and then choose Layer➪Arrange, the command applies
to the stacking order only within the layer set.

You can merge layer sets. Select the set and choose Merge Layer Set from the Layers
palette pop-up menu or choose Layer➪Merge Layer Set. For more on merging, see the
next section.

You can rename your set by double-clicking the set name in the Layers palette. Or
choose Layer➪Layer Set Properties or choose Layer Set Properties from the Layers
palette pop-up menu.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Being the true layers evangelist that I am, I have spent the last two chapters touting the glo-
ries of layers. And they are wonderful. But they do have a dark side. They can make your file
go from slim and trim to bulky and bloated. A consequence of a larger file size is that it slows

your computer system performance. And you are limited in the types of file formats that allow
you to save layers. You can preserve layers only in Photoshop’s native format (.psd), TIFF
(.tif), and PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Photoshop smashes your
layers down into a background. This file limitation often forces users to save two versions of
every layered file — one as a native Photoshop file and one as something else, such as EPS or
JPEG, to import into another program. For more on file formats, see Book II, Chapter 2.
Merging layers combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a single layer (not a back-
ground). The intersection of all transparent areas is retained. You can merge layers or layer
sets. You can also merge adjustment or fill layers (see Book V, Chapter 1 for details), but they
cannot act as the target layer for the merge. Merging layers can help to decrease your file size
and make your document more manageable.
Flattening an image combines all visible layers into a background. Photoshop deletes hidden
layers and fills any transparent areas with white. Flattening is usually reserved for when
you’re completely finished editing your image.
When you convert an image from one color mode to another, it may cause the file to flatten.
Look out for the warning dialog box that prompts you of this result and go back and save a
copy of your file as a native Photoshop file, thereby preserving your layers.

Merging layers
You can merge your layers several ways. Here’s the first option:
Book
V
Chapter
2
1.
Ensure that all the layers (and layer
sets) you want to merge are visible.
Note that Photoshop prompts you with
a dialog box informing you that all
hidden layers will be discarded.
Click OK.
2.
Choose Merge Visible from the Layers
palette pop-up menu or the Layer
menu.
All visible layers are smushed into a
single layer, as shown in Figure 2-7. The
newly merged layer takes on the name
of the topmost layer.
To merge visible layers without discarding
your hidden layers, press Alt (Option on
the Mac) when choosing Layer➪Merge
Visible.
You may also want to check out the
“Alternative methods for merging
layers” sidebar.
Because merging layers is such an important
aspect of your Photoshop experience, I thought
you’d want to know that (as with other Photoshop
options and tools) there’s more than one way to
merge layers. In fact, here are two sets of steps to
help you get the job done. I know, I know, I’m
such a giver. Try this method to merge layers:
1. Link all the layers and layer sets you
want to merge.

Stamping layers
Photoshop also allows you to stamp your layers. Stamping merges layers onto a target (or
active) layer (you can leave some layers untouched). Stamping layers is similar to using the
Merge Visible command while holding down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.

2. Choose Merge Linked from the Layers
palette pop-up menu or the Layer
menu.
Photoshop combines all linked layers into a
single layer. The newly merged layer takes on
the name of the topmost layer.
Or you can try this method:
1. Position the layer or layer sets you
want to merge adjacent to each other
in the Layers palette.
2. Select the top layer of those you want
merged.
3. Choose Merge Down from the Layers
palette pop-up menu or the Layer
menu. If the top layer is a layer set, the
command is called Merge Layer Set.
Note that Merge Down merges your active
layer with all layers below it, so make sure
that every layer underneath your active layer
should be merged.

To stamp layers, follow these steps:

1.
Move the layer you want to stamp to
above the layer you want to stamp
from. Both layers must be visible.
2.
Select the top layer and press
Ctrl+Alt+E (Ô+Option+E on the Mac).
You can also stamp linked layers by
selecting one of the linked layers and
choosing the same command.
If you want to stamp all visible layers,
select the layers (or layer sets) and
press Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E (Shift+Ô+
Option+E on the Mac). You may need
to borrow a friend’s fingers for that
keyboard combo.

Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
1.
Ensure that all the layers you want to
retain are visible.
Remember that Photoshop will discard
all hidden layers.
2.
Choose Layer➪Flatten Image, or
choose Flatten Image from the
Layers palette pop-up menu, shown
in Figure 2-8.
Note that Photoshop doesn’t prompt
you with a warning like, “Are you sure
you really want to do this?” But if you
mistakenly flatten your image, you can
undo the command by immediately
choosing Edit➪Undo. If you’ve gone
ahead and performed another action,
then undo your mistake by using the
History palette (see Book II, Chapter 4).

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Checking Your Collage for Flaws and Consolidating Layers
When you begin a project, you may think
you know what you want the final result to
look like. But as your creative juices start
flowing, you may decide that something
doesn’t look right. For example, as I was
working on my collage, I discovered that
the sky behind and above the canyon was
a little on the ordinary side.
1.
Open the saved collage file and
open a new image that you want to
incorporate into the collage.
In my example, I thought the sky
needed some kick, so I opened an
image that contained a sky I liked.
b Select the part of the image that
you want to add to your collage.
I chose the Rectangular Marquee
tool and selected a strip of sky.
Most of the time, consistency is key.
In my example, however, I didn’t
need to feather the image. Because
it’s going to be pasted into the old
sky, the edges of the element won’t
be seen.
c Using the Move tool, drag the selec-
tion into the collage.
Because I’m pasting the image into
the background image, I first needed
to make the selection I wanted to
paste into. I used the Magic Wand
tool. After a couple of additional
Shift+clicks, I selected the entire sky
behind the canyon. Then I copied
and pasted the image (using the
Edit➪Paste Into command) into its
new location.

When you’re close to finalizing your col-
lage, you might want to consolidate layers.
Minimizing the number of layers makes
projects easier to manage, which is great
when you get ready to add the finishing
touches to your collage.
Be sure that before you merge your
layers, you will never have to manipu-
late them separately, especially if the
elements on the layer overlap each
other, as mine do.
To consolidate two layers, follow these
steps:
1.
Select a layer in the Layers palette
and click in the second column
next to the layer you want to con-
solidate it with.
b Choose Merge Linked from the
Layers palette pop-up menu.
The two layers merge and become
one.

Working with the Layer Comps Palette
This version of Photoshop has brought us a new feature called Layer Comps. Although this
feature doesn’t really add more layer functionality, because it shares a similar moniker, I’d
thought I would explain it in Book V. 
What Layer Comps does do is enable you to create and save multiple versions of your docu-
ment within a single master file. This function actually makes the Layer Comps palette more of
a distant cousin to the History palette. Through the Layer Comps palette, Photoshop records
all the vital statistics of your layers, including their visibility, position, and blending options.
This comes in handy when you want to show a client or art director various design versions
within a single document. That’s right. No longer do you have to save the various renditions
of a design or project in multiple files.
You can also use Layer Comps in ImageReady to produce various link pages for a Web site,
all within a single document file.
Follow the steps below to discover how the Layer Comps palette operates:
1.
Choose Window➪Layer Comps to dis-
play the palette, shown in Figure 2-9.
2.
Create all your desired layer content.
Note that if you perform all your edit-
ing on just a Background, you cannot
save the document as a layer comp.
3.
When you have a version of the docu-
ment that you want to save as a comp,
click the New Layer Comp button or
choose New Layer Comp from the
palette pop-up menu.
The New Layer Comp dialog box
appears, shown in Figure 2-10. 
To create a comp and bypass the
options dialog box, hold down the Alt
(Option on the Mac) key when you
click the New Layer Comp button.
Note if you execute certain commands,
such as changing the size of the docu-
ment (cropping, using Image Size or
Canvas size and so on) or rotating by any
amount other than 180 degrees, you get a
warning alarm icon, which informs you
that you will not be able to fully restore
the layer comp.
4.
Name your layer comp, and choose
the attributes you want recorded —
Visibility, Position, and Appearance
(Layer Style) of the layers. You can
also add an optional comment about
the configuration you are capturing.
Click OK.
Note that if you add a comment, you
see a triangle just to the left of the
layer comp name. Click the triangle to
expand to see your comment in the
palette.
5.
Continue creating your various con-
figurations of the document, captur-
ing a layer comp after each.
6.
To display a particular layer comp,
click in the left column in the Layer
Comps palette.
You see a document icon, which indi-
cates that particular layer comp is
selected.

Here are a few more Layer Comp tidbits:

To rename a layer comp, simply double-click its name in the palette.

To delete a layer comp, select it and click the trash can icon in the Layer Comps
palette. You can also drag the layer comp to the trash can icon or choose Delete Layer
Comp from the palette pop-up menu.

To duplicate a layer comp, select it and drag it onto the New Layer Comp button in the
palette or choose Duplicate Layer Comp from the palette pop-up menu.

To update a particular layer comp with the currently active configuration of the docu-
ment, select the layer comp and then choose Update Layer Comp from the palette pop-
up menu or click the Update Layer Comp button at the bottom of the palette.

To display your document at its latest configuration (but not necessarily the latest
saved layer comp), choose Restore Last Document State from the palette pop-up or
simply click on Last Document State in the Layer Comps palette.

To rearrange the order of the layer comps, simply drag it to a new location in the palette.
Photoshop offers you a variety of great ways to output your layer comps. Here is the lowdown
on each:

Choose File➪Scripts➪Layer Comps to Files: Select this command and Photoshop
exports your layer comps to individual files. In the dialog box, shown in Figure 2-11, pro-
vide a destination and Prefix name for your file. Indicate whether you want to include
only selected layer comps (you must select them before you choose the command).
Leave the Selected Layer Comps Only option deselected to have Photoshop export all
layer comps. Then choose your desired file type and specify whether you want to
include ICC Profiles (See Book II, Chapter 2) and Maximize Compatibility (see Book I,
Chapter 6). Click Run and then sit back and watch the magic happen. Photoshop runs
the script and sequentially numbers and saves your layer comps to individual files at
your specified location. If all goes well, Photoshop will prompt you that your export was
successful. It doesn’t get better than that.
7.
To efficiently cycle through all your
layer comps, Ctrl+click, (Ô+click for
Mac) all your comps in the palette to
select them all. 
You can also click the first layer comp
and then Shift+click the last layer
comp, which automatically selects all
files in between. Then click the Apply
Next Selected Layer Comp and Apply
Previous Selected Layer Comp buttons
at the bottom of the Layer Comps
palette.
You can also, less efficiently, apply
layer comps by selecting the particular
layer comp and choosing Apply Layer
Comp from the palette pop-up menu.
The document icon will move to that
layer, and Photoshop will display that
layer comp.

Working with the Layer Comps Palette


Choose File➪Scripts➪Layer Comps to PDF: Choose this command to export your layer
comps as a multipage PDF file. Photoshop saves each layer to a separate PDF page. In
the dialog box, shown in Figure 2-12, click the Browse button to provide a filename and
destination. Indicate whether you want to include only selected layer comps. Then
choose your options for your PDF Slide Show presentation. Specify the amount of time
you want in between pages and whether you want the show to loop (keep playing con-
tinuously). Click Run. Photoshop runs the script and saves the PDF to your destination.
Attach the PDF to an e-mail (or FTP it), and the recipient of your file can open and view
the PDF using Acrobat Reader (a free download from www.adobe.com). This is a great
way to present design and project options to your clients, coworkers, or directors for
review and decision-making.

Choose File➪Scripts➪Layer Comps to WPG: This option exports your layer comps to a
Web Photo Gallery. In the dialog box, shown in Figure 2-13, click Browse and choose a
destination for your file. Next, specify a gallery style and whether you want to export
only the selected layer comps. Click Run. Photoshop does its scripting thing and auto-
matically launches a Web Photo Gallery in your default browser, displaying each layer
comp both as a thumbnail and as a larger image, shown in Figure 2-14. This can also be
a great way to handle client or management review of project designs, especially if
e-mailing isn’t an option.

I
f you’ve read Book V, Chapters 1 and 2, you have a pretty
good handle on the methods of layer creation and manage-
ment. (If not, what are you waiting for? Take a look at them
and come on back when you’re ready.) In this chapter, I show
you how to let down your hair and get those creative juices
flowing. Yes, I’m about to say the “F” word: Fun.
This chapter, along with Book V, Chapter 4, focuses on how to
tweak the layers you’ve made. Maybe you want to make one of
your layers semi-transparent so that you can see the layer
beneath it; or say you want to try blending the colors between
a couple layers in a way that is slightly offbeat. Look no further.
Although some of the techniques in this chapter may start to
reek of being too complex or technical, keep in mind that it’s
not mandatory to totally understand them. Take these tech-
niques as far as you want to. And remember there’s no substi-
tute for good old experimentation.
If you want to play around with blend modes and opacity
but you’re not ready to commit just yet, make a backup
copy of an image (it helps to use an image that contains
layers, of course). You can play around without perma-
nently hurting the image. If the results of your activities
offend you, you can always choose File➪Revert. And try,
try again.
Adjusting Layer Opacity
By far one of the easiest ways to make your image look oh so
sophisticated is to have one image ghosted over another, as
shown in Figure 3-1 (and in full, living color in the color insert).
Creating this effect is a snap with the Opacity option in the
Layers palette. To adjust the opacity, select your desired layer

in the Layers palette. Then either access the slider by clicking the right-pointing arrow or
enter a percentage value in the Opacity text box. You can also double-click a layer thumbnail,
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Blending Options, or choose Blending Options from the Layers
palette pop-up menu (click the triangle in the upper-right corner to open the menu). All three
methods bring up the Layer Style dialog box, where you can enter a value or drag the slider
for opacity.
The Opacity setting allows you to mix the active layer with the layers below it in varying per-
centages from 100% (completely opaque) to 0% (completely transparent). Remember that you
can adjust the opacity only on a layer, not a background. That’s because there’s nothing
behind the background to mix with.
You can also change the Opacity percentage by using keyboard shortcuts. With any tool
active, except a painting or editing tool, press a number key. Press 5 for 50 percent, 25 for
25 percent. If you are entering a two-digit value, just be sure you type the numbers quickly
or else Photoshop will interpret the numbers as two different values. You get the picture.
Note that for the default of 100 percent, you must press 0.
Figure 3-1

Creating Effects with Blend Modes

Adjusting the Fill Opacity
In addition to adjusting the regular opacity for a layer, you can also adjust the fill opacity. Fill
opacity works a little differently from regular opacity. The regular Opacity setting affects layer
styles (see Book V, Chapter 4) and blend modes (see the following section, “Creating Effects
with Blend Modes”), which have been applied to the layer.
Fill opacity, however, affects only the pixels or shapes that reside on the layer. It doesn’t affect
the styles or blends. As you can see in Figure 3-2, the drop shadow and emboss styles in the
bottom example show through full strength. To adjust the Fill Opacity setting, select your
desired layer in the Layers palette and enter a value in the Fill Opacity text box or drag the pop-
up slider. The other methods for adjusting fill opacity are similar to the regular opacity option.
Creating Effects with Blend Modes
You’ll see them called blend modes, painting modes, brush modes, layer modes, calculations,
or just plain modes. They are usually referred to as blend modes or layer modes when used
with layers and painting modes, and brush modes when used in conjunction with a painting
or editing tool. But whatever you call them, the 24 blend modes determine how the colors in
different layers interact with each other. Blend modes can produce a multitude of interesting,
sometimes even bizarre, effects. And what’s more, you can easily apply, change, or discard
blend modes with no permanent damage to your layers.

The options in the Blend Mode pop-up menu (located under the Layers tab) in the Layers
palette are the same as those found on the Mode pop-up menu in the Options bar, with the
exception of two modes. Behind and Clear are found only in the Options bar because they are
only available for use with painting and editing tools.
I urge you to pick an image with a few layers and apply each blend mode to get a good
handle on what the various blend modes do. In fact, try a few different images, because the
effects may be subtle or intense depending on the colors in the image. Throw in some differ-
ent opacity percentages, and you’re on your way to endless hours of creative fun.
General blend modes
You’re probably very familiar with the Normal blend mode by now. It is the default and lets
each pixel appear in its very own unadulterated state. The other three can be used only in
certain circumstances. Behind and Clear can be used only when you have a painting or editing
tool in hand. And Dissolve can be used only with a layer that has an opacity setting of less
than 100% — the lower the opacity, the more intense the effect. Figure 3-3 shows the general
blend modes in action, and Table 3-1 describes them. Because it is hard to see the true effect
of blend modes in grayscale figures, be sure and check out Color Plate 5-3 to see them in
color.

Default mode. Each pixel appears in its original, normal state.
Dissolve
Only affects images that have Opacity settings of less than 100%. Allows some
pixels from lower layers, which are randomized, to show through the target layer.
Behind
Only available with a painting or editing tool active. Type must be rasterized,
and Lock Transparency must be deselected. Allows you to edit or paint only on
the transparent areas of the layer, giving the illusion that the strokes are behind
the layer.
Clear
Only available with a painting or editing tool active. Type must be rasterized, and
Lock Transparency must be deselected. Allows you to edit or paint with trans-
parency, giving the appearance that holes are being punched into your image.
Blend modes that darken
Overall, the blend modes in this category all produce effects that darken your image, as shown
in Figure 3-4. However, one of my favorite uses for the Darken blend mode is a little different.
Scan a handwritten letter or sheet of music and layer it over an image. Apply the Darken blend
mode to the letter or sheet music layer. The white areas of the paper become transparent, and
only the letters or musical notes display, creating a nice composite image. Table 3-2 describes
these modes.

Multiply
Color Burn
Linear Burn

TABLE 3-2: BLEND MODES THAT DARKEN
Blend Mode
Description
Darken
If the pixels on the layer are lighter than those below, the lighter pixels turn
transparent. If the pixels on the layer are darker, they display unchanged. A
great mode for superimposing scanned text or line art because it allows the
white color of the paper to essentially drop out, leaving only the dark letters
or lines. 
Multiply
Burns the layer into the layers underneath. The Multiply mode darkens all
colors where they mix. With layers, it is comparable to sticking two slides in
the same slot in a slide projector. If painting, each successive stroke creates a
darker color, as if drawing with markers.
Color Burn
Darkens the layers underneath and burns them with color. Increases contrast.
Blending with white pixels has no effect. Like applying a dark dye to your image.
Linear Burn
Darkens the layers underneath by decreasing the brightness. Similar to
Multiply but tends to make portions of your image pure black. Blending with
white pixels has no effect.
Blend modes that lighten
If you have blend modes that darken, well, it just makes good sense to have those that lighten.
So if you have the need to throw some digital bleach on your brightly colored pixels, try out a
couple of these blend modes, described in Table 3-3. Figure 3-5 shows examples of these effects.

Lighten
If the pixels on the layer are darker than those below, the darker pixels turn

opposite of Darken.
Screen
Lightens the layer where it mixes with the layer underneath. Blending with
black pixels has no effect. Like putting two slides in two different projectors and
pointing them at the same screen. The opposite of Multiply.
Color Dodge
Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath and infuses them with colors from
the top layer. Like bleaching your layer. Blending with black pixels has no effect.
Linear Dodge
Lightens the layers underneath by increasing the brightness. Similar to Screen
but tends to make parts of your image pure white. Blending with black pixels
has no effect.
Lighting blend modes
The Hard Mix blend mode is the lone newcomer to the repertoire of lighting blend modes.
Some of these blend modes, like Overlay and Pin Light, are reserved for the occasional wacky
special effect. Figure 3-6 shows examples of these effects. Table 3-4 describes the modes.
TABLE 3-4: LIGHTING BLEND MODES
Blend Mode
Description
Overlay
Multiplies the dark pixels in the top layer and screens the light pixels in the
underlying layers. Enhances the contrast and saturation of colors.
Soft Light
Darkens the dark pixels and lightens the light pixels. If the pixels on the top
layer are lighter than 50% gray, the lighter pixels are lightened further. If the
pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the mode darkens pixels.
Blending with black or white results in darker or lighter pixels but doesn’t make
parts of your image pure black or pure white. Similar to Overlay, but softer and
more subtle. Like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
Hard Light
Multiplies the dark pixels and screens the light pixels. Like shining a bright, hard
spotlight on the image. If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50% gray,
they are screened. If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the
mode multiplies the pixels. Can be used to add highlights and shadows to an
image. Blending with black or white gives you black and white.
Vivid Light
If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, this mode burns, or dark-
ens, the colors by increasing the contrast. If the pixels on the top layer are
lighter than 50% gray, the mode dodges, or lightens, the colors by decreasing
the contrast. A combination of Color Burn and Color Dodge.
Linear Light
If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the mode burns, or dark-
ens, the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the pixels on the top layer are
lighter than 50% gray, the mode dodges, or lightens, the colors by increasing the
brightness. A combination of Linear Burn and Linear Dodge.

TABLE 3-4: (CONTINUED)
Blend Mode
Description
Pin Light
Replaces the colors of pixels, depending on the colors in the top layer. If the
pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the mode replaces pixels darker
than those on the top layer and doesn’t change lighter pixels. If the pixels on the
top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode replaces the pixels that are lighter
pixels than those on the top layer, and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. A
combination of Darken and Lighten and useful for special effects.
Hard Mix
Similar to Vivid Light, but reduces the colors to a total of eight — Cyan, Magenta,
Yellow, Black, Red, Green, Blue and White. Although the results depend on the
mix of existing colors on the top and bottom layers, this mode creates a highly
posterized effect.

Blend modes that invert
If the preceding blend modes are a tad too tame for you, you may want to check out the
“Inverters” — Difference and Exclusion (described in Table 3-5). These blend modes invert
your colors and can produce some interesting special effects, as shown in Figure 3-7.
TABLE 3-5: BLEND MODES THAT INVERT
Blend Mode
Description
Difference
Produces a negative or inverted effect according to the brightness values on
the top layers. If the pixels on the top layer are black, the mode doesn’t
change the colors of the underlying layers. If the pixels on the top layer are
white, the mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers. Can produce
bizarre results.
Exclusion
Similar to Difference, but with less contrast and saturation. If the pixels on the
top layer are black, the mode doesn’t change the colors of the underlying
layers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, the mode inverts the colors of
the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create gray.
HSL color model blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness) color model to mix colors. My
favorite blend mode in this group is Color, which allows you to apply color to images without
obscuring the tonality. Table 3-6 lists these modes, and Figure 3-8 shows their effects.
TABLE 3-6: HSL COLOR MODEL BLEND MODES
Blend Mode
Description
Hue
Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the color) of

the top layer.

TABLE 3-6: (CONTINUED)
Blend Mode
Description
Color
Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation and hue of
the top layer. This mode is great for colorizing grayscale (with a color mode
set to RGB) images because it preserves the shadows, highlights, and details
of the underlying layers.
Luminosity
Blends the hue and saturation of the underlying layers with the luminance of
the top layer. Preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top
layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers. The opposite
of Color.
Working with the Advanced Blending Options
If you want to get serious about layers, then you need to know about the Advanced Blending
Options, found in the Layer Style dialog box. These options allow you to tailor the way your layer
styles and blend modes interact with your layers. Getting to the advanced options is just like
accessing opacity and blend modes: You can double-click a layer thumbnail, choose Layer➪Layer
Style➪Blending Options, or choose Blending Options from the Layers palette pop-up menu. The
massive Layer Style dialog box rears its multipaneled head, as shown in Figure 3-9.

Channels: This option allows you to restrict your blending options to specific channels
only. For all you need to know about working with channels, check out Book VI.

Knockout: This option allows you to specify which layers have holes in them so that you
can view the layers underneath. You first have to use the Fill Opacity option to set the
opacity of the knockout. The lower the opacity, the more the hole shows; therefore, set
it to 0% (as in my example in Figure 3-10) to see all the way through. Set the Knockout
to Shallow to create a hole through one layer set (see Book V, Chapter 2) or a clipping
group (see Book V, Chapter 4). Set the Knockout to Deep to create a hole all the way
through to the background. If you’re just working with layers, and not sets or clipping
groups, the knockout cuts through to the background. If there is no background, it cuts
through to transparency.

Blend Interior Effects as Group: This option applies the blend mode of the layer to
interior layer effects, such as inner glows, satin and color overlay, and so on. Deselect
this option, and the blend mode does not affect the layer effects. (See Figure 3-11. Check
out the color insert, as well.)

Blend Clipped Layers as Group: The blend mode of the bottom layer in the clipping
group affects all the other layers in the group. Deselect this option, and each layer
retains its own blend mode and appearance.

Transparency Shapes Layer: Confines layer effects and knockouts to opaque areas of a
layer. Deselect this option, and the mode applies layer effects and knockouts to the
entire layer. (See Figure 3-12.)

Layer Mask Hides Effects: Confines layer effects to the area designated by the layer
mask. (For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)

Vector Mask Hides Effects: Confines layer effects to the area designated by a vector
mask. (For more on vector masks, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)
Blend If options
By using the slider bars, you can specify which colors are visible in the active layer and which
colors show through from the underlying layers. You can choose a specific channel from the
Blend If pop-up menu to apply the option to a single channel. The default channel of Gray
affects all channels in the image.


The This Layer slider bar allows you to set a blending range. In other words, you can
hide certain colors according to the brightness values in the active layer. By dragging
the black triangle to the right, you exclude darker colors. By dragging the white triangle
to the left, you exclude lighter colors.

The Underlying Layers slider bar forces the colors from the underlying layers to show
through the active layer. Again, dragging the black and white triangles excludes ranges
of colors.
Excluding and forcing colors can result in some harsh color transitions. You can provide for a
smoother transition between blended and unblended areas by splitting the slider into two
parts. This allows the pixels to gradually fade to transparency. Alt+drag (Option+drag on the
Mac) on either the black or white triangle in either slider bar to split the triangle into two
halves. The left and right triangles mark the beginning and end of the blending range, where
pixels will fade into or out of view.
PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Fine-tuning and Adjusting Opacity Settings in Your Collage
If you’ve followed along with the Putting-It-
Together project I discuss in Book V,
Chapters 1 and 2, you may have a collage
that you’re pretty satisfied with. You just
need to make the final tweaks and finally go
to sleep (or get home to your spouse and
children). But not before running around
the room congratulating yourself on a proj-
ect well done. Not so fast, Bucko. You still
haven’t made those tweaks I mentioned.
One of the most important tweaks you can
make is to opacity. Here’s how to adjust
the opacity settings on some of the layers:
1.
Open your saved collage file.
If the Layers palette isn’t already vis-
ible, open it.
2.
Select a layer in your collage and
move the opacity slider to the left
or to the right.
If you want the layer to be more
opaque, move the slider to the right.
If you’re interested in making the
layer more transparent, move the
slider to the left.
I chose Layer 4 and adjusted the
opacity to 75%. I like the blue sky in
my collage, but it’s a tad too vibrant
in comparison to the rest of the
image. Adjusting the opacity tones
down and allows the blue to blend
in more naturally.
3.
When you’ve adjusted opacity for a
layer, save the file and move on to
the next layer you want to adjust.
If you have more complicated opac-
ity settings to adjust, keep reading.
4.
Select the background layer and
then choose Duplicate Layer from
the Layers palette pop-up menu.
Click OK to close the Duplicate
Layer dialog box.
Making a copy of the background is
great because it allows you to add a
blend mode, as you’ll do in the next
step, and then adjust it to get just
the right amount of the effect.
For example, if you want to define an
element in your collage, but applying
it directly on the layer produces too
intense of an effect, make a copy of
the layer. I wanted to pump up the
definition of the canyon in my col-
lage, but when I used the blend
mode directly on the background,
the result looked too harsh.
By the way, I couldn’t resist the urge
to include a pair of hiking boots in
my collage.

Select the background copy layer
and choose a mode (such as Vivid
Light) from the Mode pop-up menu
in the Layers palette.
It’s likely that now the definition looks
great but the contrast is over the top.
f Adjust the opacity to tone it down.
I changed the opacity in mine to 35%.
7.
When you’re satisfied with the opac-
ity and contrast, save the collage file.

I
f you’ve already read the first three chapters of Book V,
you’re reaching the end of your guided tour on layers. And
like most tours, I wanted to leave some of the more interest-
ing items for last. You know, go out with a bang and all that.
(If you haven’t already checked out the other chapters on layers,
what are you waiting for? This chapter assumes that you’re
using layers, so you’re free to excuse yourself and come back
later.)
After you have all the basic elements in your layered composite
image, you may want to give it a little pizzazz and finesse.
Maybe a headline would pop out a little more if you beveled the
edge, or maybe that silhouetted image would take on a little
more dimension if you placed a drop shadow behind it. This is
the chapter where you find out how to do that and more. But
remember the old adage, less is more. Just because you can do
something doesn’t necessarily mean you should. I mean, if you
bevel and shadow everything, your image may go from well
done to overdone.
Layer Styles Basics
In the old days, creating a drop shadow in Photoshop took a
concerted effort. And beveled or embossed type? Well, let’s just
say you really had to have the inside scoop on some Photoshop
tricks. Now, however, Photoshop makes creating these kinds of
effects as easy as selecting an option.
You may see the terms effect and style used interchange-
ably. Technically, Adobe says that after layer effects have
been applied to a layer, they become part of a layer’s style.
As far as I’m concerned, effects create a style, so, for the
purposes of this chapter, the terms are one and the same.

You can apply layer effects to regular layers, shape layers, fill layers, and type layers, but not
to backgrounds, locked layers, or layer sets. For more on backgrounds, see Book V, Chapter 1.
For details on locking layers and creating layer sets, see Book V, Chapter 2.
Layer effects are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you move or edit the contents
of the layers (even just to change the letters of your type), the effects are updated.
When you apply effects, they become part of the layer’s style. A styled layer has a florin
symbol (which looks like a fancy letter f) next to the layer’s name in the Layers palette. You
can expand (to view the individual effects) or collapse the layer style by clicking the triangle
icon next to the florin. If you create a style so fantastic that you want to save it for later use,
you can do that by saving a custom style as a preset and storing it in the Styles palette (see
“Creating your own style,” later in this chapter).
Introducing Layer Styles
Layer effects fall into a few categories. You can add shadows, glow effects, beveled and
embossed edges, overlay colors and patterns, and, of course, tweak to your heart’s content.
The following sections give you the basics. I go into detail on each layer style later in this
chapter, and I show you the effects in full-color glory in the color insert.
Shadows
Shadows add a soft drop or inner shadow to a selection or the contents of a layer. You can
adjust the blend mode, color, opacity, angle, size, and contour of the shadow to suit your
needs. Figure 4-1 shows examples of both types of shadows.

Drop Shadow: Applies a shadow behind the elements.

Inner Shadow: Adds a shadow that falls inside the edges of the elements, making them
look recessed.
Drop Shadow
Inner Shadow
Figure 4-1

Introducing Layer Styles
435
Glow effects
Glows add a soft highlight that appears either on the outside or inside edges of a selection or
the contents of a layer, as shown in Figure 4-2. Like shadows, you can fine-tune the appearance
of the glow by adjusting numerous options.

Outer Glow: Applies a glow around the outside edges of the elements.

Inner Glow: Adds a glow around the inside edges of the elements.
Beveled, embossed, and satiny looks
Bevels create a 3-D edge on either the outside or inside edges of a selection of the contents of
a layer, giving the element some dimension. Similarly, emboss effects make elements appear
as though they are raising off or are punched into the page. Satin is intended to create a satiny
or draped fabric effect over your element. All these effects (shown in Figure 4-3) offer numer-
ous options to adjust their appearances.

Outer Bevel: Creates a 3-D raised edge around the outer edges of the elements.

Inner Bevel: Makes a 3-D edge on the inside edge of the elements.

Emboss: Combines the inner and outer bevels’ effects to give the illusion that the ele-
ments are raised off the page.

Pillow Emboss: Reverses an inner bevel making it seem that the elements are stamped
or punched in along the edges and raised in the center.

Stroke Emboss: Applies an emboss to a stroke made via the Stroke layer style.

Satin: Applies a shading to the inside shape of the elements, creating a satiny
appearance.

Overlays and Stroke
Overlays apply a fill of color, a gradient, or a pattern over your selection or the contents of
your layer, as shown in Figure 4-4. You can adjust the opacity of the overlay, among other
options, to allow your original element to show through more clearly. You can also surround
your element with a stroke consisting of color, gradient, or pattern:

Color Overlay: Covers the elements with a color.

Gradient Overlay: Covers the elements with a gradient.

Pattern Overlay: Covers the elements with a pattern.

Managing and Editing Layer Styles
You can always just apply the layer effect with Photoshop’s default settings, but what fun is
that? To edit a style, double-click the layer thumbnail or the layer style icon in the Layers
palette and make your desired adjustments in the Layer Style dialog box.
The following sections give you the details on each of the options. But a picture is worth a
thousand words. Experiment to really see these effects come alive.
Managing layer styles
Here are a few pointers to keep in mind when working with and editing layer styles:

Choose several effects at one time: Simply select the check box for the effect on the
left side of the Layer Style dialog box. To access the options for each effect, you must
click the effect name so that it is highlighted.

Remove an effect: Deselect the check box associated with it.

Move a style onto a separate layer: By default, layer styles are attached to a layer. To
put a style on a separate layer, select the styled layer and choose Layer➪Layer
Style➪Create Layer. You see a new layer in the Layers palette with a name, such as
Layer 0’s Drop Shadow, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Although separating a style onto its own layer may give you more manual editing capability
and allow you to apply filters, you lose all editing ability with the Layer Style dialog box. Also,
the style won’t dynamically update when you change the layer itself. Your style basically
becomes just a generic mass of colored pixels.

Figure 4-5
e When you’ve refined your effect set-
tings, click OK.
Photoshop applies your effect to your
layer as indicated by the florin.
The Layer Style dialog box also has options
for Styles and Blending Options (default).
See Book V, Chapter 3, for blending
options and this chapter for styles.

Copy and paste effects onto other layers: Select the layer containing the effect and
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. Select the layer on which you want to
apply the effect and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. Even easier, you can
also just drag and drop an effect from one layer to another.

Copy an effect onto multiple layers in one fell swoop: Link the layers and choose
Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style to Linked.

Hide effects: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects.

Display hidden effects: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Show All Effects. You can also
Alt+double-click (Option+double-click on the Mac) the style in the Layers palette.

Remove all the effects on a layer: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer Style. You
can also drag the Effects bar (what Adobe calls the name Effects) to the trash can icon in
the Layers palette.

Remove a single effect: Double-click the effect in the Layers palette and deselect it in
the Layer Style dialog box. You can also just drag and drop the single effect to the trash
can icon in the Layers palette.

Resize a layer effect: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select Preview and
enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This command allows you to scale the effect
without scaling the element.

This prevents the shadow from show-
ing through the object.

Changing default inner and outer glow effects
The inner and outer glow effects possess many of the same settings as the shadows. But
unlike shadows, with glows you also have the option of using a gradient for your glow. This
can produce an interesting custom halo effect, as shown in Figure 4-8. 
Follow these steps to edit your own glow:

1.
Double-click the layer thumbnail or

2.
Specify Blend Mode, Opacity, Color,
Spread, and Size settings.
If you are editing an inner glow effect,
you see the options of Source (Center
or Edge) and Choke rather than
Spread. The Center option applies the
glow over the entire image except the
edge, whereas the Edge option applies
only to the element’s edge. The Choke
option behaves similarly to the way the
Spread option behaves.
c Choose a preset gradient from the
Gradient drop-down palette or click
the Gradient Editor button to edit or
create your own gradient.
4.
In the Technique option, choose
either the Softer or Precise setting.
Choose Softer to apply a blurred glow.
This option doesn’t preserve detailed
edges of the element.
Choose Precise to create a glow that is
good for hard-edge elements such as
type. This option does preserve the
details.
5.
Use the Range and Jitter options for
the Contour setting.
For more on contours, see the “Playing
with Contours” section, later in this
chapter.

When you’ve refined your effect set-
tings, click OK.
Your effect is edited and ready to rock.

Editing Bevel and Emboss Effects
Because Photoshop offers five bevel and emboss styles, you have, of course, a ton of options.
Some are similar to those found with the shadow and glow effects, whereas others are unique.
The Layer Style dialog box is divided into four panels.
Structure
This panel contains the most relevant options, as shown in Figure 4-9:

The Technique settings of Smooth, Chisel Hard, or Chisel Soft determine how soft
or hard the edge of the bevel is. Chisel Hard works well with type and harder-edged 
elements.

Depth affects how raised or sunken the edge of the bevel or the pattern appears.

For the Direction settings, Up positions the highlight along the edge closest to the light
source, and the shadow on the opposite edge. Down does the opposite and positions
the shadow near the light source.

Size controls the size of the bevel or emboss effect.

Soften blurs the shading of the effect.

Angle is the same as with Drop Shadow.
Shading
Because of the 3-D nature of bevel and emboss effects, Photoshop has settings for Highlight and
Shadow (each with separate Blend Modes and Opacity options) and Depth. Because bevels and
embosses are more dimensional, an additional setting of Altitude affects the light source.
Texture
In the Texture panel (click Texture on the left side of the dialog box), shown in Figure 4-10, you
can apply a pattern onto your layer that creates a texture. Adjust the scale and depth of the
Figure 4-9

Changing Overlay Effects

pattern, and link the pattern to the layer if desired. If you link the pattern and layer, the pat-
tern moves when you move the layer. The Snap to Origin command aligns the pattern origin
with the document if you have selected the Link with Layer option. If you haven’t selected the
option, the Snap to Origin command aligns the pattern to the upper-left corner of the layer.
Contour
Contours change the distribution of the colors in the effect. You can use the various presets
offered to create interesting, and sometimes bizarre, shadows, glows, bevels, and other
effects. For details on contour and its various iterations, see the upcoming section, “Playing
with Contours.”
Editing Satin Effects
You can adjust the blend modes, opacity, angle, distance, and size — all of which have been
explained in the preceding sections. You can also adjust the contour, which is discussed later
in “Playing with Contours.”
Changing Overlay Effects
Shadows, being based in reality, are the kinds of effects you will find yourself using frequently.
On the other hand, you’ll probably use overlay effects only occasionally, if at all. In most
cases, overlays are reserved for the realm of the special effect. But in case you need to apply
an overlay, here are the options:
Figure 4-10
Book
V
Chapter
4

Book V  Chapter 4: Getting Jazzy with Layer Styles and Clipping Groups
444

Color Overlay: Adjust the Blend Mode, Opacity, and Color settings of the overlay. This
effect, along with the Gradient Overlay and Pattern Overlay, is best used with an opacity
setting of less than 100% or a Blend Mode other than Normal. That way, the elements
underneath aren’t totally obliterated.

Gradient Overlay: Choose a preset gradient from the drop-down Gradient picker,
shown in Figure 4-11, or click the Gradient swatch to access the Gradient Editor to
create your own. The Align with Layer option uses the bounding box of the layer to cal-
culate the gradient. Specify the angle, style (Linear or Radial), and scale of the gradient.
Reverse flips the gradient. Adjust Blend Modes and Opacity settings.

Pattern Overlay: Choose a preset pattern from the Pattern picker drop-down palette.
Snap to Origin and Link with Layer work the same as with Bevel and Emboss. Choose
Blend Modes and Opacity settings.
Changing Stroke Effects
As shown in Figure 4-12, specify the size of your stroke in pixels and whether you want it to
ride the outside, center, or inside of the edge of the element. Determine the Blend Mode and
Opacity settings. And finally, specify whether to fill your stroke with a color, gradient, or pat-
tern. Choose your desired color, gradient, or pattern from the corresponding options.
Figure 4-12
Figure 4-11

Playing with Contours
445
Playing with Contours
Several of the layer effects have various options for contours. Contours change the distribu-
tion of the colors in the effect. The default setting for all the effects, except satin, is linear con-
tour. In an effect with a linear contour, the opacity drops off in a straight line.
But you’re not limited to the linear contour option. Click the arrow of the Contour option, and
you’ll find a variety of preset contours, as shown in Figure 4-13. Click the palette arrow, and
you can load yet another contour preset library.
The presets offer contours like ring, rolling, sawtooth, and steps, all of which create rings of
transparency within the shadows and glows. If you use contours with bevel and emboss
effects, you can create nooks, crannies, bumps, and lumps that are highlighted and shaded.
You can also find options for naming and deleting contours as well as saving, loading, reset-
ting, and replacing contour libraries. Choosing different contours can create fun and funky
shadows and glow. These are the effects in Figure 4-14 from top to bottom:

Adjusting contour settings
Of course, you’re using Photoshop, the Swiss Army Knife of the graphics-editing world, so you
can do a whole lot more than choose a preset contour and apply it to a layer. Depending on the
effect you’re working with, you can change the appearance of the contour in a variety of ways:

Noise: Randomizes the colors of selected pixels in the drop shadow to give a gritty effect.

Anti-aliasing: Slightly softens the edge pixels of a contour.

Range: Controls how much of the glow is targeted for the contour, as shown in Figure
4-15. Reduce the Range setting to get a less feathered, tighter, and larger glow.

Jitter: Doesn’t affect the appearance of the default glow, but with other gradients, the
Jitter setting varies the color and opacity of selected pixels to give a roughened effect.

Invert: Turns the colors of the satin effect inside out.

Gloss Contour: Changes the distribution of color in the effect over the layer. It creates
a metallic effect when used with the Bevel and Emboss styles. The indented Contour
option, which appears below the Bevel and Emboss style in the Styles list, does the
same for the edges of the layer. It creates shaded and highlighted nooks and crannies
when used with the Bevel and Emboss styles.
Figure 4-14

Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
447
Modifying contours with the Contour Editor
If the preset contours just don’t do it for you, feel free to create your own by using the
Contour Editor dialog box, accessed by clicking the Contour thumbnail. Click the line on the
mapping line to add points and drag the line to adjust the slope. You can also select a point on
the mapping line and enter values for Input and Output.
To create a sharp corner instead of a curve, select a point and click Corner. When you have
the contour to your liking, click the New button, give it a name, as shown in Figure 4-16, and
click OK. Photoshop saves your custom contour as a preset and makes it available on the
Contour palette.
You can save custom contours for reloading later or for trading with friends and neighbors.
(Try giving them away on Halloween.) Photoshop saves contours as a .shc file in the
Contours folder in the Presets folder in the Photoshop application folder.
Applying and Modifying Preset Styles
In addition to layer effects, Photoshop also offers you a multitude of preset layer styles that
you can access via the Styles palette, shown in Figure 4-17.
Figure 4-16

You can also access these styles by using the drop-down Style picker in the Options bar, when
the Pen or Shape tools are active and you have the Shape layer option selected. And you’ll
find the Styles palette nestled in the Layer Style dialog box as well, as shown in Figure 4-18.
Here are the many splendid ways to apply a preset style:

Select the layer and click a style in the Styles palette.

Drag and drop a style from the Styles palette onto a layer in the Layers palette.

Drag and drop a style directly onto the image window. When your cursor is over the
element to which you want to apply the style, release your mouse button.


Double-click the layer thumbnail in the Layers palette. Select Styles in the upper-left
side of the Layer Style dialog box. Choose a style from the palette. Click OK to close the


If you’re using the Pen or one of the shape tools, select the Shape Layer option. Then
select a style from the Style picker drop-down palette in the Options bar before drawing
the shape.
By default, applying a style over another style replaces it. To add a style along with another,
press the Shift key while clicking or dragging the style.
Managing preset styles
Here are some additional points to remember when using the Styles palette. You can do any of
the following:

Load another Style preset library: Click the triangle at the top right of the Styles
palette, Style picker drop-down palette, or the palette in the Layer Style dialog box.
From the menu that appears, choose Load Styles to add a library to your current preset
list. Select the library and click Load. You can also choose Replace Styles. Even easier,
just choose a preset library from the bottom of the menu and click OK to replace or
append your current list.

Use the Preset Manager to load preset style libraries: You can also rename, delete, and
save whole libraries of presets. See Book I, Chapter 6.

Return to the default library of presets: Choose Reset Styles.

Choose a viewing option for your palette: You can choose Small or Large Thumbnail or
Small or Large List. And, of course, there’s also Text Only, but what fun is it if you can’t
see the presets?

Rename a preset style: Double-click the style in the Styles palette. If you’re in
Thumbnail view, type a new name in the dialog box and click OK. If the view is set to
list, simply type a new name directly and press Enter (Return on the Mac). You can also
choose Rename Style from the pop-up menu, which you can access by clicking the trian-
gle in the upper right of the Layers palette, the picker in the Layer Style dialog box, or
the Style picker drop-down palette in the Options bar.

Save a set of preset styles as a library: Choose Save Styles from the pop-up menu found
in the Styles palette, from the pop-up menu in the Layer Style dialog box, or from the
pop-up menu in the Style picker drop-down palette in the Options bar. Name the library,
navigate to the Styles folder in the Presets folder in the Photoshop folder, and click Save.

Delete a preset style: Drag the style to the trash can icon in the Styles palette or
Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) on the style. You can also choose Delete Style from
the pop-up menu, found in the Styles palette, the Layer Style dialog box, or the Style
picker drop-down palette in the Options bar.

To clear a style (that is, remove it from the layer): Click the Clear Style button in the
Styles palette. You can also click the No Style swatch in the standalone Styles palette or
the ones located in the Layer Style dialog box or Options bar.

Change the style or color of the currently active shape layer: Click the link icon in the
Options bar and select a different style or color. This option allows you to experiment
with different styles for that shape. Also, the color swatch in the Options bar changes
as the foreground color changes.
Conversely, deselect the link icon, and Photoshop won’t change the style of the active
shape layer when you select a different style. This option allows you to choose a differ-
ent style or color for a new shape layer without affecting the previous shape layer. If
you have the link icon deselected, the active shape layer determines the color swatch in
the Options bar.

Creating your own style
If you get bored using the preset style libraries or if you really went to town and created a
custom style that you think is so fabulous that you’ll want to use it again and again, you can
easily save it to the Styles palette. Here’s all you need to know about saving custom styles:
1.
Create your own custom style by
applying layer effects and/or styles to
your layer.
It is also easy to start with an existing
preset style and modify the settings to
suit your needs. 
2.
After you complete your style, click
the Create New Style button in the
Styles palette or choose New Style
from the palette pop-up menu.
You can also drag your selected layer
from the Layers palette onto the Styles
palette or simply click in an empty
space in the Styles palette. Or you can
double-click the layer thumbnail to
open the Layer Style dialog box where
you can click the New Style button.
c In the New Style dialog box, shown in
Figure 4-19, name your style and
select your desired options.
Include Layer Effects will include any
effects you applied via the Effects sec-
tion of the Layer Style dialog box —
drop shadows, bevels, and so on.
Include Layer Blending Options will
include any blending you did using the
Blending Options section of the Layer
Styles palette. For more on blending
options, see Book V, Chapter 3.
Photoshop adds your new style to the
end of the Styles palette. Unfortunately,
unlike effects, after you create custom
styles, you can’t edit them. So make
sure you like it before you make it a
custom style, or you’ll end up redoing it.
Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) to
create a new style and bypass the dialog
box. Your style gets the default name of
Style 1.

Clipping Layers into Groups

Clipping Layers into Groups
In a clipping group, the bottommost layer, also known as the base layer, acts as a mask for the
layers in the group. The layers in the group clip to the opaque areas of the base layer and do
not show over the transparent areas of the base layer.
At this point, you might be saying, “Huh?” Rather than trying to decipher the definition, a
better way to understand a clipping group is to just create one. Follow the steps listed here
and I know that instead of “Huh,” you’ll be saying “Yeah, baby,” just like Austin Powers.
Creating a clipping group works well if you want to fill type with different images on multiple
layers.
Using the steps that follow, I created a new document with a white background. I took the
Custom Shape tool and, choosing the Fill Region option (see Book IV, Chapter 2, for more on
shapes), drew a fish on my second layer.

I then opened an image of some fish and dragged and dropped that image onto my composite.
I opened an image of some dolphins, selected a dolphin, and dragged and dropped it onto my
composite.
And, finally, I created some type and applied a drop shadow and inner bevel layer effect to the
type.
Follow these steps to create your own clipping group:
Here is some clipping group trivia:
 To remove a single layer from the clipping
group, you can simply Alt+click (Option+click)
the line between the two layers in the Layers
palette. Or you can select the layer and
choose Layer➪Release Clipping Mask. Both
commands remove the selected layer and any
layers above it from the clipping group.
 To ungroup all the layers in the clipping
group, select the base layer and choose
Layer➪Release Clipping Mask.
 You can also apply clipping groups to adjust-
ment and fill layers. If you clip between a reg-
ular layer and an adjustment layer, or a
regular layer and a fill layer, the adjustment or
fill layer affects only the pixels of the adjacent
underlying layer, instead of all the underlying
layers. For more on adjustment and fill layers,
see Book V, Chapter 1.
Managing clipping groups
1.
Open or create an image that has sev-
eral layers.
2.
Press Alt (Option on the Mac) and
position your mouse cursor over the
line dividing two layers in the Layers
palette.
Your cursor changes to two overlap-
ping circles with a small arrow icon.
You can also choose Layer➪Create
Clipping Mask. Note that in previous
versions, Adobe called this command
Group with Previous.
3.
Click your mouse button.
I did this three times, in between my
type and the dolphin layer, in between
the dolphin and the fish layer, and in
between the fish layer and my fish
shape. Notice how all my images and
my type clip to the base layer (the
fish shape).
Nothing outside the boundaries of the
fish shape is visible on any of the layers
in the clipping group, as shown in Figure
4-20. The down-pointing arrow icon indi-
cates that the layers are clipped.
You can also link layers and choose
Layer➪Create Clipping Mask from
Linked. With either command, Create
Clipping Mask from Linked or Create
Clipping Mask, the clipping group takes
on the opacity and blend mode of the
base layer.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Adding Text and Layer Styles to a Collage
If you’ve been reading Book V faithfully,
then you may have a nearly complete
collage on your hands. If you’re at all inter-
ested in using words with your images,
then now (at the end of the project, not
the beginning) is the time to add them in.
Adding type can take a good composite
and turn it into a dynamite and cohesive
image that conveys exactly what you want
it to. I’m no Shakespeare and can’t help
you create the perfect tag line, but I can
show you how to add some text and incor-
porate it into your collage. Adding layer
styles gives you versatility in the kinds of
effects you can apply to styles, so I show
you how to apply those to a collage.
If you need a type refresher, check out
Book IV, Chapter 4.

To add and adjust type, follow these steps:
1.
Open the saved collage file.
Make sure that the Layers palette is
open.
2.
Select the Eyedropper tool from
the Toolbox (more formally known
as the Tools palette). Click a color
in the collage that you like.
The color you sampled is now the
foreground color.
3.
Select the Type tool. In the Options
bar, select a font, style, and point
size, and other formatting options.
I recommend choosing an easy-to-
read serif font and applying a bold
style to it. I’m using Times Bold, and
I set the point size to 100.
I set the anti-aliasing to Crisp and
the Alignment to Left, but you can
explore your options until you’re
dizzy (or your deadline passes).
4.
Click inside your image and type
some text.
I typed “Go outside” for my travel
collage.
e Select the Move tool from the
Toolbox and position the type in
the collage.
I put my text in the upper-left
corner.
6.
Adjust your settings as you desire.
If you want to add a second, smaller,
line of text, grab the Type tool again,
and, in the Options bar, reduce the
point size. You can change other set-
tings, as well.
g When you’re satisfied with your
changes, click under the first line
of text and type your next line.
Under “Go outside,” I typed “and
play.”
With the Move tool, fine-tune the
position of the type.

When you’re satisfied with the size, style,
color, and appearance of the type in your
collage, you can make some more large-
scale changes by creating layer styles.
Follow these steps:
1.
Add a drop shadow and make sure
that you have selected Global Light
so that all the layers will use the
same angle.
In the Layers palette, first select the
layer that includes the first line of
text. Then choose Layer➪Layer
Style➪Drop Shadow. Make sure the
Drop Shadow box is selected in the
left column.
You can change the angle so that the
light source is coming from one direc-
tion or another (mine’s set at 120% so
that the light’s coming from the left).
2.
Add bevels and embossing.
Click the Bevel and Emboss style in
the left column.
Make sure that you actually select the
style and not just the box; otherwise,
the right panel with all the options
won’t appear.
In my example, I selected Inner
Bevel from the Style pop-up menu in
the right panel. Then I selected
Chisel Soft from the Technique pop-
up menu. My idea was to give the
type a carved-in-stone look.
c Click OK when you’re satisfied
with the styles you’ve created in
the layer so far.
d Apply the same styles to the layer
where the second line of text is.
To get the exact same settings without
having to go through every adjustment
again, right-click (Control+click on the
Mac) on the florin (the f symbol) on
the first layer you worked on and
choose Copy Layer Style from the
menu that appears. Select the second
type layer and right-click (Control+click
on the Mac) on the layer name and
choose Paste Layer Style from the con-
text menu.
5.
Make any last adjustments and
choose File➪Save.
You’re all done. If you feel like it,
keep adding to or refining the col-
lage as you learn new tricks.

Channels and Masks


I
f you’re reading this, it probably means that you didn’t
quickly thumb through this chapter, say, “Yuck, boor-
rrrringgg!” and move on to sexier topics such as blending, fil-
tering, and retouching. You knew that would be a huge mistake.
The wonderful thing about channels is that they offer you
greater control and selectivity when doing those very things —
blending, filtering, and retouching. Channels bring one more
level of control when editing your images. You can use individ-
ual channels for layer blending options, filters, and as starting
points for masks.
Channels also come into play when saving selections for later
use or for adding spot (custom) colors to your image. You can
also use channels to turn color images into nicely contrasted
grayscale images. And finally, you can play around with the
colors in an image by mixing up the channels. So bear with
me. The topic of channels may be a bit dry and technical, but
in the end, they’ll enable you to hold the envious title of Master
Editor.
To understand how channels work, you’ll find it helpful to know
a few things about colors — specifically the various color
modes, which I cover in Book II, Chapter 2.
Understanding Channels
When you look at a color image, you see one big, 24-bit, com-
posite collection of colored pixels. Technically speaking, how-
ever, Photoshop doesn’t see that at all. Photoshop perceives a
color image as individual bands of 8-bit, grayscale images. RGB
images have three bands; CMYK images have four bands.
I know it’s strange to think of a color image as being composed
of several grayscale images, but it’s true. Each one of these

bands, or grayscale images, is a channel. Specifically, they’re color channels. Check out Color
Plate 6-1 to see this concept illustrated in color.
If you just can’t get past the fact that a color image is the sum of several grayscale channels,
as shown in Figure 1-1, then just think of channels as holding tanks of color data.
Another way of relating channels to the real world is in terms of hardware. Here’s how the
most common hardware handles color:

When you offset print a CMYK image, the process separates the colors (see Book X,
Chapter 2) into four colors — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Paper passes through
four individual rollers on the printing press, each roller containing one of those four 
colored inks.

Scanners scan in RGB via a pass of red, green, and blue sensors over your image.

CRT Screens display images via red, green, and blue tubes.

Understanding Channels
461
In addition to color channels, there are channels called alpha channels (covered later in this
chapter); others are called spot channels (discussed in Book X, Chapter 2).
Photoshop now supports up to 56 channels per file. So knock yourself out! Just remember
that each channel you add increases your file size.
Briefly, you can use alpha channels to create, store, and edit selections, defining them not by
a selection outline, but by black, white, and varying shades of gray pixels — in other words, a
grayscale image. Black pixels represent unselected areas of the image, while white pixels rep-
resent selected areas, and gray pixels represent partially selected pixels.
You can create spot channels when you want to add a spot, or custom, color to your image.
Spot colors are premixed inks often used in addition to or in lieu of CMYK colors.
All images, no matter what their color mode, have at least one channel. Grayscale, Duotone,
and Indexed Color (for GIF Web images) modes have only one channel. RGB and CMYK
images have three and four channels, respectively. They also contain a composite channel,
which reflects the combination of the individual color channels and gives you the full color
display.
Book
VI
Chapter
1
When you’re standing around the water cooler or
the color printer, and you hear people talking
about a 1-bit or an 8-bit image, they’re referring
to something called bit depth. Bit depth measures
how much color information is available to display
and print each pixel. A higher bit depth means the
image can display more information — specifically,
more colors. For example, a 1-bit image can dis-
play two color values — black and white. That’s
why a purely black-and-white image is called a
bitmap image. Likewise,
 An 8-bit image has 256 grayscale levels (28).
Grayscale images are 8 bit (1 channel × 8 bits).
 A 24-bit image has about 16 million colors
(224). RGB images are 24 bit (3 channels x
8 bits). 
 CMYK images are 32 bit (4 channels x 8 bits).
CMYK images, however, are limited to the
number of colors that are physically repro-
ducible on paper, which is around 55,000.
Bit depths typically range from 1 to 64 bits.
Scanners often allow you to scan an image at 64
bits. At 64 bits, each channel contains 16 bits, for
a total of 4,096 levels of gray. This added color
information gives you more data to work with
when you adjust levels, curves, hue/saturation,
and color balance, and when you apply filters
such as Unsharp Mask.
Previously, the tools and commands available for
16-bit images were somewhat limited. This new
version of Photoshop, however, gives you
expanded abilities to edit 16-bit images (espe-
cially helpful for filmmakers). If necessary, when
your adjustments are made, you can still convert
your 16-bit image to an 8-bit image. To do so,
make sure you flatten your images if they have
any layers. Then choose Image➪Mode➪8 bits/
Channel.
A little bit about bit depth

Working with Channels
As with layers, channels have their own palette that acts as command central for viewing, 
creating, and managing tasks. The first step is accessing channels by choosing Window➪
Channels. The Channels palette appears, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Viewing channels without a remote
To select a channel, click the channel thumbnail or name in the palette. To select more than
one channel, Shift+click. To show or hide a channel, click in the eye column in the far left of
the palette. Selecting a channel automatically makes it show. You can also drag through the
column to hide or show the channels quickly.
CMYK, RGB, and Lab images have a composite channel in addition to their individual channels.
This composite channel is the combination of all the channels in the image and is named
after the color mode. For example, the composite channel in Figure 1-2 is the first one,
called RGB.
Changing the default channel view
The default setting is to view your channels in grayscale. You can, however, view them in color.
To do so, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors (Photoshop➪Preferences➪Display &
Cursors on Mac OS X) and select Color Channels in Color.
Although this option graphically exemplifies the way an image comprises separate color 
channels, it really does you no good if you want to work with your channels for editing.
That’s because the color view obscures details and makes measuring the impact of adjust-
ments and filters more difficult. You need to see the channels in their true grayscale form
for that.

If you select or show more than one channel, even in the default grayscale view, the channels
always appear in color.
To change the size of the thumbnail that appears, choose Palette Options from the Channels
palette pop-up menu. Select your desired thumbnail size. If you’re working with several 
channels and you have a dinosaur of a computer, you can also choose None to turn off the
thumbnails — to improve its performance.
Duplicating and deleting channels
Duplicating channels is something you may do quite often. I know I do. And of course, deleting
channels isn’t something you do only if you’re a neat freak. Channels take up a lot of memory,
so it’s always good to get rid of the ones you no longer need.
Here are some instances when duplicating channels is a good idea:

When you want to create a channel mask: First, you find a suitable channel and then
make a duplicate. (For more on this technique, see Book VI, Chapter 3.) You can use
channel masks to select difficult elements involving fine details, such as hair, fur, smoke,
and so on.

When you want to make a backup copy of the channel before doing some editing: It’s
always a good idea to have a backup just to be on the safe side. For example, you may
want to apply an Unsharp Mask filter to one or two channels to improve the focus of the
image. For more on the Unsharp Mask filter, see Book VII, Chapter 1.

To insert a copy of an alpha channel into another image: For example, maybe you
spent an hour creating elaborate alpha channels for shadows and highlights on a 
product photographed in flat lighting.
You may have 12 products, all the same shape, but different colors that you need to
apply those highlights and shadows to. Rather than re-creating the wheel each time,
you could simply duplicate the alpha channels into each file.

nel in the destination image that you want to replace and choose Edit➪Paste. The pasted
channel replaces the original one.

Deleting unwanted channels
To delete an unwanted channel — something you definitely want to do because channels can
eat up a lot of space — select the channel in the Channels palette and do one of the following:

Drag the channel to the trash can icon at the bottom of the palette.

Choose Delete Channel from the palette pop-up menu.

Click the trash can icon and then click Yes.

Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) on the trash can icon.
Rearranging and renaming channels
Although you can’t shuffle or rename color channels, you can do so with spot and alpha chan-
nels. To move a spot or alpha channel, simply drag it up or down in the Channels palette. When
you see a dark line appear where you want the channel to go, release your mouse button. You
can move a spot or alpha channel above a color channel only in a multichannel image. In short,
in a multichannel image, each channel becomes an independent spot channel, and the channels
no longer have a relationship with each other. Multichannel images also do not support layers.
The only file formats that support this mode are Photoshop, Photoshop Raw, and Photoshop
DCS 2.0 (DCS stands for Desktop Color Separations). For more details, see Book II, Chapter 2.
To rename a spot or alpha channel, double-click the name in the Channel palette and type a
new name. You can also choose Channel Options from the palette pop-up menu.
Splitting channels
You can split the channels of your image into separate images in separate files, as shown in
Figure 1-4. Choose Split Channels from the palette pop-up menu. When you do so, your origi-
nal image closes. The channel files have the name of your original image plus the channel
name. You can split channels only on a flattened image — in other words, an image with no
individual layers.
You might want to split channels if you need to save your original file in a format that doesn’t
preserve channels — such as EPS, which doesn’t support alpha channels — or you may want
to split channels to merge them later on.
Make sure that you save all changes in your original image before you split it because
Photoshop closes it.

You can also duplicate a channel to another
image by dragging the channel. Open your des-
tination image and drag the desired channel
from your current image into the destination
image window. The duplicated channel appears
in the Channels palette.

Merging channels
You can merge channels into a single image. The channels must be open, in grayscale mode,
and have the same pixel dimensions. You can merge channels only when they are flattened
images and have no layers. You may find a need to merge channels because you have a DCS
(Desktop Color Separation) file that has lost its link (the original image) and it’s unusable. You
can open the individual channel files and merge them into a single image. Then resave it as a
DCS EPS. For more on DCS and other file formats, see Book II, Chapter 2.
You can also merge color channels to create some unique special effects. For example, by mis-
matching your channels when you merge them, you can create some really bizarre, and some-
times beautiful, color shifts.

1.
Open your channel files and activate
any one of them.
2.
Choose Merge Channels from the
palette pop-up menu.
c Choose your desired color mode.
Any modes that are unavailable are
grayed out. That’s because you may
not have enough channels for that
mode.
d Enter the number of channels you
want.
When you choose your mode in Step 3,
Photoshop automatically fills in the
number of channels for the mode.
If you deviate and enter something 
different, the file becomes a multi-
channel file.
5.
Click OK.
f Select your channels.
If you want to merge the channels 
normally, make sure that each
channel matches (Red for Red
and so on). If you want to rearrange
the channels, you can mix them as
I did in Figure 1-5.
7.
If you are merging into a multichan-
nel image, click Next. Repeat for each
channel.
8.
Click OK.
You have now merged your files into a
single image, which appears in your
Photoshop window.
Photoshop closes individual channel
files and merges any spot channels as
alpha channels.
Check out Color Plate 6-2 to see how
my sunflower went from yellow to
magenta just by merging the layers a
little differently.
If you have an image with alpha or spot
channels, choose Multichannel from
the Mode drop-down list in Step 3 or
Photoshop will not include those channels
in the merged image. After you merge
the image, Photoshop gives all the chan-
nels the names Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Alpha 3,
and so on. To get back to a color compos-
ite, choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color or
CMYK Color.

Using Painting and Editing Tools with Channels
Sometimes it’s better to edit individual channels rather than the composite image. Mediocre
flatbed scanners often reproduce an image that is slightly soft or out of focus. You may want
to counteract that effect by applying an Unsharp Mask filter. Before you do, you should exam-
ine each channel separately. You may find that the Blue channel contains a lot of garbage —
artifacts, dithering, and other nasty crud.
Blue channels are notorious for acquiring this junk, so try to avoid applying an Unsharp
Mask filter on this channel unless you really want to accentuate what’s already ugly.
Instead of applying the Unsharp Mask filter on Blue channels, select the Red and Green chan-
nels and then choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask. Similarly, you can apply a Gaussian Blur
filter to a channel to soften the unsightly pattern (called a moiré pattern) caused by scanning
a halftone. (See Book VII, Chapter 1, for more on moiré patterns.)
While Unsharp Mask and Gaussian Blur are a couple of your corrective filters that you’ll use
frequently, I also find it useful to apply a special-effect filter to individual channels as well.
Sometimes applying a filter to the composite image produces an effect that’s, well, overdone.
Applying the filter to one or two channels can produce an effect that is subtler and less in-
your-face, as shown in Color Plate 6-3. Using individual channels can also be useful for apply-
ing filters that produce monochromatic images, such as the Graphic Pen or Photocopy filters.
If you apply the filter to the entire image, you get a black-and-white image. If you apply it to an
individual channel, you retain some color.
You can select a color channel and then edit that channel by using a painting or editing tool to
paint in the image. Keep these facts in mind:

Painting with white adds the color channel’s color at full intensity in the composite
image.

Painting with black removes the color in the composite image.

Painting with a value of gray adds color at varying levels of intensity in the composite
image.
For example, if you paint with white on the Blue channel in an existing image, Photoshop adds
more blue to the color composite image. But if you paint with black, Photoshop adds yellow
to the image because when you remove blue, what’s left is the opposite, or complementary,
color — yellow. To perform this channel magic, select the Brush tool and then choose your
desired brush size from the Options bar. Choose your desired color in the Color palette. Select
the channel you want to edit in the Channels palette. You can see the results by selecting the
composite channel in the Channels palette. Take a look at Color Plate 6-3 to see how I gave a
flower a channel color makeover.
The results are a little different if you try this technique on a blank CMYK canvas. When you
paint with black on the Cyan channel, your composite color image displays cyan. When you
paint with white, you get nothing.

Using Alpha Channels
469
Using Alpha Channels
You use alpha channels to make and store selections that you make with the selection tools,
such as the Lasso or Magic Wand tool. You can also use alpha channels to edit selections. 
An alpha channel is a type of mask. You can think of masks, which you find out more about
in Book VI, Chapters 2 and 3, as selections using some or all the 256 available levels of gray,
instead of a selection outline. Alpha channels define a selection in black, white, and varying
shades of gray pixels. In other words, alpha channels store selections as 8-bit grayscale images.
In alpha channels, selected pixels are white, unselected pixels are black, and anything in
between is partially selected or partially unselected, depending on whether you think the
glass is half full or half empty.
You can create a mask by duplicating a color channel and then editing that channel with 
painting and editing tools and filters. Most graphics geeks refer to this as a channel mask.
See Book VI, Chapter 3, for more on channel masks.
If you create an alpha channel from a saved selection, the channel most likely consists of just
black or white pixels. If you have a feathered or even an anti-aliased selection, you may have
a few gray pixels. If you create an alpha channel by duplicating and editing a color channel,
your alpha channel most likely contains varying shades of gray pixels as well.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼

Saving a selection as an alpha channel
One of the great things about alpha channels is that you can save them and then retrieve
them time and time again. This can be especially handy if you’ve taken a lot of time and effort
to create the selection. Why reinvent the wheel if you want to select the element again in the
future? Sure, you can create a mask using Quick Mask Mode and Color Range (see Book VI,
Chapter 2), but those masks are only temporary.

The hardest part about creating an alpha channel is making the initial selection. After that, it’s
a piece of cake. Follow these steps to create an alpha channel:
1.
Make a selection in your image.
2.
Choose Select➪Save Selection.
You can also click the Save Selection
as Channel button (a circle on a
square icon) at the bottom of the
Channels palette. A new channel
appears with the default name
of Alpha 1 and bypasses Steps 3
through 6.
3.
Choose a destination image in the
Document pop-up menu. 
You can choose your current image
or any other open image with the
same pixel dimensions.
4.
Choose a destination channel from
the Channel pop-up menu. 
You can choose a new channel or any
existing channel or layer mask. (See
Book VI, Chapter 3, for more on layer
masks.)
5.
If you choose New, name the channel.
6.
If you choose an existing channel
or layer mask, select your desired
operation. 
Replace, Add To, Subtract From,
or Intersect With are the options.
Replace substitutes your existing
alpha channel with the new selection.
Add To, Subtract From, or Intersect
With, of course, adds to, subtracts
from, or intersects your current 
selection with the existing alpha 
channel.
7.
Click OK.
Your alpha channel is complete and
appears in the Channels palette, as
shown in Figure 1-6.

Alpha channel tips and tricks
Here are a few closing alpha channel tidbits:

Try showing the alpha channel along with the composite channel. That way you can see
how clean your mask is.
Note that when you display them both, the alpha channel appears as a semitransparent color
overlay.

You cannot add channels to images that are in Bitmap mode. That’s because all pixels in
a Bitmap mode file are either black or white. Photoshop does not support intermediary
shades.

You can convert alpha channels to spot channels. For more on spot channels, see
Book X, Chapter 2.
Loading an alpha channel
No doubt if you’ve gone through the trouble of creating an alpha channel, it’s because you
want to be able to easily load, or access, the selection again and again. To load an alpha chan-
nel, use any one of these many methods:

Choose Select➪Load Selection. Select your document and channel. Click Invert to swap
selected and unselected areas. If your image has an active selection, choose how you
want to combine the selections.

Select the alpha channel in the Channels palette, click the Load Channel as Selection
button at the bottom of the palette, and then click the composite channel.

Drag the channel to the Load Channel as Selection icon.

Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the alpha channel in the Channels palette.

Ctrl+Shift+click (Ô+Shift+click on the Mac) to add the alpha channel to an active 
selection.

Ctrl+Alt+click (Ô+Option+click on the Mac) to subtract the alpha channel from an
active selection.

Ctrl+Alt+Shift+click (Ô+Option+Shift+click on the Mac) to intersect the alpha channel
with an active selection.
Adding channels can start to bloat your file size, so use them, but use them judiciously. The
Photoshop native format and TIFF format compress channel information and therefore are
good file formats to use when working with a lot of channels. The only formats that preserve
alpha channels are Photoshop, TIFF, PDF, PICT, Pixar, or Photoshop Raw. A single image can
now have a maximum of 56 channels.

Using the Channel Mixer
The Channel Mixer actually does what its name implies — it mixes color channels. This fea-
ture lets you repair bad channels and produce grayscale images from color images. It also
allows you to create tinted images and more intense special effects. Finally, it allows you to do
the more mundane tasks of swapping or duplicating channels. 
Although some Photoshop elitists worldwide tout this as an advanced feature not to be
mucked with by amateurs, I say, “Give it a whirl.” Intimidation is a nasty roadblock to creative
fun. Just make a backup copy of an image before diving into the mix:
1.
Select the composite channel in the
Channels palette.
If you have an RGB image, the compos-
ite channel is the RGB channel; for
CMYK images, the CMYK channel.
2.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Channel
Mixer.
The Channel Mixer dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 1-7.
3.
For Output Channel, choose the chan-
nel in which to blend one or more
source (existing) channels.
For example, if your Blue channel is
lousy, select it from the Output
Channel drop-down list.
d Drag any source channel’s slider to
the left to decrease the channel’s
effect on the Output channel. Or drag
to the right to increase the effect.
Because my Blue channel contains 
artifacts and dithering picked up
by the scanner, I am raising the Red
and Green values from 0% to 25%
and lowering the Blue value from
100% to 50%. To retain good contrast,
try to use a combo of Red, Green,
and Blue values that add up to close
to 100%.
You can also enter a value from –200
to +200%. Using a negative value
inverts the color data of the source
channel.
e Tinker with the Constant option to
add a black or white channel of vary-
ing opacity.
Drag the slider to a negative value to
get a black channel. Positive values
give a white channel.
This option brightens or darkens the
overall image. I recommend leaving it
at 0 most of the time. But try it. It may
help.
f Select Monochrome to apply the same
settings to all output channels produc-
ing a color image that has only values
of gray. 
Adjust the individual sliders to mix the
values until you are satisfied with the
contrast.
This option is one of the best ways
to produce grayscale images from
color images because it preserves
detail and provides better contrast
control. 
7.
Click OK to exit the Channel Mixer.
After you exit the Channel Mixer,
choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale to
complete the conversion.
If you select and then deselect the
Monochrome option, you can modify
the blend of each channel separately.
By doing so, you can create color images
that appear to be hand-tinted with color
inks. Go for the subtle treatment or a
more intensely colored look.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Giving Flat Art Highlights and Shadows
Sometimes you need to give your art —
whether it’s a photo or another type of
image — a little shine and shadow to bring
it to life.
You can do this by creating and saving
your selections as alpha channels and fill-
ing them with translucent color.
The great thing about alpha channels is
that because you save them with your
document, you can use them time and
time again.
Just follow these steps:
a Create a simple piece of artwork to
use as a basis for your shadows
and highlights.
I created a pool ball by creating two
layers.
 On each layer, I used the Elliptical
Marquee tool to create different-
sized circles.
 I filled each of the circles with a
separate color.
CONTINUED
▼
Swapping color channels can produce
some bizarre color effects. For example,
try selecting the Red channel from the
Output Channel drop-down list. Set the
Red source channel to 0 and then set
the Green source channel to 100. Try
other combinations, Green for Blue,
Blue for Red, and so on. Sometimes
they can be downright freakish, but occa-
sionally you may stumble on one that’s
worthy.

pixels before I saved the selection.
The cast shadow needs to have really
fuzzy edges, thus the large number of
pixels for the feather.

the back end by using those alpha
channels to apply highlights and
shadows to similar artwork.

I
f you checked out the last chapter on channels, you’ve been
at least briefly introduced to masks via the world of alpha
channels. You can use alpha channels, a type of mask, to
create, store, and edit selections. But just in case you skipped
right to this chapter, allow me to give you a brief introduction.
Masking is essentially just another way of making a selection.
Instead of defining your selection with a selection outline,
masks define your selection with 256 levels of gray, which
allows you to have varying levels of selection. Photoshop
masks or protects unselected pixels from any commands you
execute. Photoshop doesn’t mask selected pixels, making them
fair game to any executed commands. 
There are different types of masks for different purposes —
channel masks, layer masks, and vector masks. You can use
them to temporarily make a selection, save and load selections,
define vector shapes, selectively apply an adjustment layer or
filter, blend one layer into another, and so on. This chapter
covers using masks for selection purposes. 
Although selecting with the Marquee, Lasso, and Magic Wand
tools can be fine, you’ll soon find that these tools have a limited
repertoire: You can’t use them with much accuracy on more
complex images. Sure, you could break out the Pen tools and
for some difficult images they do a superb job — that is, if you
can get the hang of drawing Bézier curves.
But when you need to play with the big boys, that’s when
you turn to masking. Most things that pack a powerful punch
are either expensive or hard to master, or both. Well, you
already forked out a pretty penny for Photoshop. And yes,
masking isn’t for those who get their selections via a drive-thru
window.

In this chapter, I ease you into masking by using Photoshop’s automated masking tools. They
make it easier on you, but the downside is they aren’t quite as accurate as the hard-core
masking I cover in Book VI, Chapter 3. But with certain images (or a serious time crunch), the
quick-and-dirty masking tools get the job done.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Working with Quick Masks
As you can probably guess from the name, Quick Masks allow you to create and edit selec-
tions quickly without having to bother with the Channels palette. They are also user friendly
in that they allow you to see your image while you’re working (typically masking with chan-
nels doesn’t). You can begin your Quick Mask by using a selection tool or a painting tool. After
you have your Quick Mask, you can edit the mask using any painting or editing tool.
Quick Masks are temporary, so if you create one you really like, be sure and choose Select➪
Save Selection at the end of the following steps. That way you can save the mask as an alpha
channel. For more on alpha channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
Follow these steps to create your very own Quick Mask:
1.
Open a new document and, using any
selection tool, select the element you
want in your image.
Don’t worry about getting the selection
perfect. You’ll be able to fine-tune your
selection after you have the Quick
Mask in place. Note that you can also
just paint your mask from scratch. But
I think that starting with a selection is
easier.
b Click the Quick Mask mode button in
the Toolbox (also known as the Tools
palette).
The Quick Mask mode button is the
white circle on a gray square icon,
shown in Figure 2-1. A color overlay
covers and protects the area outside
the selection. The selected pixels are
unprotected.
c Refine the mask by selecting a paint-
ing or editing tool. 
Paint with black to add to the mask,
thereby making the selection smaller.
Paint with white to delete from the
mask, making the selection larger. Paint
with a shade of gray to partially select
the pixels. Partially selected pixels take
on a semitransparent look, perfect for
feathered edges. See Figure 2-2.
You can also apply a filter or adjustment
(Image➪Adjustment) to the Quick Mask.
See this technique in action in Book VII,
Chapter 2.
Even though the Quick Mask displays a
red overlay, you are still working with a
grayscale image. If you don’t believe
me, pull up the Channels palette and
look at the Quick Mask channel.
d After you finish editing your mask,
shown in Figure 2-3, click the Standard
mode button (a white circle on a white
square icon) in the Toolbox to exit the
Quick Mask.
The Standard mode button is just to
the left of the Quick Mask mode
button, as shown in Figure 2-1.
The overlay disappears and a selection
outline appears.
The selection outline correlates with
the unmasked or selected areas of the
Quick Mask.
Your selection is ready and waiting for
your next command.

(unselected, protected) areas or the selected
(unprotected) areas.

Using the Color Range Command
483
Using the Color Range Command
The Color Range command allows you to select similarly colored pixels in a selection or
within an entire image. You can think of it as a smarter Magic Wand tool. Unlike the Magic
Wand tool, however, Color Range lets you adjust your selection before you ultimately get the
selection outline. It does this by using Fuzziness (a cousin of Tolerance), which allows you to
select colors relative to how closely they resemble the sampled colors. Photoshop selects all
the identical colors, partially selects similar colors, and does not select dissimilar colors. You
adjust the Fuzziness, and Photoshop adjusts the selection.
Color Range basics
Here are some Color Range command tips before you get started:

You can save and load color range settings by clicking the appropriate buttons in the
dialog box. But heck, after you have a selection, you can also choose Select➪Save
Selection to save it as an alpha channel. 

You can select a color range based on preset colors or tones that you choose from
the Select drop-down list. For example, choosing red automatically selects all the red
in the image. Choosing midtones selects all the medium-range tones in the image. And
Out-of-Gamut (only available for RGB and Lab modes) selects all colors that cannot be
printed using CMYK colors. For more on modes, see Book II, Chapter 2.
If you choose the Color Range command when you have an active selection, Photoshop
selects only colors within the selection outline and ignores the rest of your image.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
485
Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase portions of an image to the background color, to transparency,
or even to the way your image looked earlier in your editing session. There are three eraser
tools — the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser. All three share a tool
flyout menu. 
The eraser tools look like real erasers so you can’t miss them. But just in case you do, press E
and then Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
When you erase pixels (which is basically what the eraser tools do), those pixels are gone.
Gone. For good. Before using the eraser tools or the Extract command (coming up in the next
section), it might be wise to make a backup of your image. You can save the image either as a
separate file or as another layer. That way, if things run amuck, you have some insurance.
The Eraser tool
The Eraser tool allows you to erase areas on your image to either the background color or to
transparency. Select it, drag through the desired area on your image, and you’re done. 
If the image isn’t layered and has just a background, you erase to the background color, as
shown in Figure 2-6. If the image is on a layer, you erase to transparency.
I rate this tool in the same category as the Lasso tool. It’s quick, it’s easy, but it has limited
applications. Use it only for minor touchups. The Eraser tool definitely isn’t a tool to use for
making accurate selections.
The most useful function I find for the Eraser tool is to clean up my channel masks. Set the
mode to Block, zoom into your mask, and clean up those black and white pixels.

Here are the options found in the Options bar that control the Eraser tool:

Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Brush or Pencil you have
access to the Brush picker palette on the far left of the Options bar.
Use the Brush picker drop-down palette to select from a variety of brush sizes and
styles. Block has only one size, a square of 16 x 16 pixels. But because the block size
remains constant, if you zoom way in, you can perform some detailed erasing.

Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for the erasure. Opacity settings less
than 100 percent only partially erase the pixels. The lower the opacity setting, the less
it erases. This option isn’t available for the Block mode.

Flow: Set a flow rate percentage when using Brush mode. Flow specifies how fast
Photoshop applies the erasure and is especially handy when using the Airbrush option.

Airbrush: Click the button when using Brush mode to turn your brush into an Airbrush.
With this option, the longer you hold your mouse button down, the more it will erase. 

Erase to History: This option allows you to erase back to a selected source state or snap-
shot in the History palette. You can also press Alt (Option on the Mac) to temporarily
access the Erase to History option. See Book II, Chapter 4, for more information.

The Magic Eraser tool
The Magic Eraser tool works like a combination Eraser and Magic Wand tool. It both selects
and erases similarly colored pixels:
Figure 2-6

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools


When you click a layer: The Magic Eraser tool erases pixels of a similar color based on
a specified range and leaves the area transparent, as shown in Figure 2-7.

When you click an image that has just a background: The Magic Eraser tool automati-
cally converts the background to a layer and then does the same thing. 

When you click a layer with locked transparency: The Magic Eraser tool erases the
pixels and replaces the area with the background color.
The Tolerance value defines the range of colors that Photoshop erases, just like it does with the
Magic Wand tool. The value determines how similar a neighboring color has to be to the color
that you click. A higher value picks up more colors, whereas a lower value picks up fewer
colors. In my example, I set my Tolerance to 8 and clicked in the upper left of my image.
Photoshop selected and erased only a limited shade of black due to my lower Tolerance setting.
Here are the other options:

Anti-aliased: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.

Contiguous: Selects only similar colors that are adjacent to each other. Deselect this
option to delete similar-colored pixels wherever they appear in your image. 

Use All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but erases pixels on
the active layer only.

Opacity: Works like it does for the regular Eraser tool.

The Background Eraser tool
The Background Eraser tool is probably the most sophisticated of the eraser-tool lot. It erases
away the background from an image and leaves the foreground untouched, in theory anyway.
If you’re not careful, the Background Eraser tool will erase the foreground and anything else
in its path.
Like the Magic Eraser tool, the Background Eraser tool erases to transparency on a layer. If
you drag an image with only a background, Photoshop converts the background into a layer.
To use the Magic Eraser tool, you need to carefully keep the crosshair in the center of the
cursor, also known as the hot spot, on the background pixels as you drag. Then Photoshop
deletes all background pixels under the brush circumference. But, if you touch a foreground
pixel with the hot spot, it’s gobbled up as well. As you can see from my example in Figure 2-8,
I got a little too close to the man’s face in some spots, and it left him a little chewed up. 
Here’s the rundown on the options, found on the Options bar, for the Background Eraser:

Brush Presets picker: Provides various settings to customize the size and appearance
of your eraser tip. The size and tolerance settings at the bottom are for those using
pressure-sensitive drawing tablets. You can base the size and tolerance on the pen 
pressure or position of the thumbwheel.

Limits: The Only setting erases similar colors that are adjacent to one another. The
Discontiguous setting erases all similarly colored pixels wherever they appear in
the image. The Find Edges setting erases contiguous pixels while retaining the sharp-
ness of the edges.


Tolerance: Works just like the Magic Eraser Tolerance setting.

Protect Foreground Color: Prevents the erasing of areas that match the foreground color. 

Sampling: Determines what areas should and shouldn’t be erased. The default Continuous
setting allows you to sample colors continuously as you drag through the image. The
Once setting erases only areas that contain the color that you first clicked. If the back-
ground is pretty much one color, you can try this option. The Background Swatch set-
ting erases only the areas containing the background color.

Extracting an Image
The last of the automated masking tools in Photoshop is the Extract command. The name
sounds great. You expect that it plucks your desired element right out of the image, cleanly,
neatly, and without pain. But to be honest with you, I find the Extract command to be overly
complex for the results it provides. You can get lucky and select an image that works well with
the command. But frequently, it does a marginal job. When you learn the art of true, manual
masking, you may never visit the Extract command again.
Here’s how the Extract command works:
Book
VI
Chapter
2
1.
Choose Filter➪Extract. 
Photoshop brings up the Extract dialog
box, shown in Figure 2-9.
b Select the Edge Highlighter tool,
located at the top of the dialog box’s
Toolbox.
You can also press the B key to access
the tool.
Photoshop offers a Smart Highlighting
option, under Tool Options on the right
side of the dialog box. 
If your image has a well-defined edge, but
the foreground and background colors are
similar or the image is highly textured, the
Smart Highlighting option helps the Edge
Highlighter tool to cling to the edge as you
use the tool. You can toggle the option on
and off by pressing Ctrl (Ô on the Mac)
when using the Edge Highlighter tool.
c Trace around the edges of the element
you want to select. As you trace, feel
free to change the brush size, again in
the Tool Options area.
Use a small brush for well-defined,
sharp edges. Use a larger brush for
wispier detailed edges such as hair,
fur, leaves, and the like. To change the
brush size using keyboard shortcuts,
click the left (smaller) and right
(larger) bracket keys. Hold down the
bracket key, and the brush size
changes more dramatically.
Be sure that the highlighted edge overlaps
both the element and the background.
You can change the colors of the high-
light and fill in the Tool Options settings
as well. 
I traced around the man in Figure 2-9.
Make a complete path around the ele-
ment. If one or more sides of your ele-
ment is cropped off the edge, you don’t
have to highlight that side:
 Use the Hand tool to move your
image if needed. You can temporarily
access the Hand tool by pressing the
spacebar.

 Use the Zoom tool to zoom in. Press
Alt (Option on the Mac) to zoom out.
You can also Zoom by pressing Ctrl++
and Ctrl+- (Ô++ and Ô+-on the Mac).
 The Channel option allows you to
load an alpha channel as a starting
point for the extraction. You can then
modify the highlighted area using the
Edge Highlighter and Eraser tools. 
Beware. For some reason when loading the
alpha channel into the Extract dialog box,
Photoshop converts the black areas in the
mask into the highlighted area but doesn’t
highlight the white areas. This is the oppo-
site of what you would expect, but it works
out just the same. After you complete the
highlighted area, fill the unlighted area
with the Fill bucket (see Step 7).
4.
If you make a mistake as you create
your highlighted outline, press Ctrl+Z
(Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo your error.
e When you have made your outline,
use the Eraser tool to clean up any
hiccups in the outline.
Press the E key to select the Eraser tool
from the keyboard. You can have the best
of both tools and toggle between the
Edge Highlighter and the Eraser tools by
pressing Alt (Option on the Mac).
6.
To erase an entire highlight, press Alt+
Backspace (Option+Delete on the Mac).
g Select the Fill tool, the second tool in
the Toolbox (or press the G key) and
click inside the highlighted outline.
The outline fills with color, as shown in
Figure 2-9. 
If by chance the color leaks outside of
the highlighted edge, you may have a
small hole somewhere along the outline.
Locate the offending hole and patch it
with the Edge Highlighter tool. Click
inside the highlighted outline again with
the Fill tool. To unfill an area, click
inside the same area with the Fill tool.
As an alternative to using the Fill tool,
you can select the Force Foreground
option. This option can be useful if the
element you want to select is mostly
tones of one color. Use the Eyedropper
tool to sample the color in the area you
want to select. Then use the Edge
Highlighter tool to highlight those
areas containing your desired color. 
h Click the Preview button and take a
gander at your extracted element (or
click OK to skip the preview and get
your extraction).
If your background is solid and unclut-
tered, your foreground element has a
simple, uncomplicated edge, you can
see quite a bit of contrast between the
foreground and background elements,
and if the planets are aligned just so,
your results are likely to be pretty
good. My example has only a minor
bit of background fringe around the
moustache and the top of the turban,
as shown in Figure 2-10. 
i If you need to clean up a bit of fringe,
give the Smooth option a shot.
This option removes stray pixels or
artifacts from the selection. A high
value smoothes out the edges around
the selection, but can cause some
undesirable blurring as well. Start with
0 or a small value first, before increas-
ing the Smooth amount.
10.
If you’re happy with the results,
click OK.
Photoshop deletes the masked areas.
If your image was a background,
Photoshop converts it to a layer, so
the selected element will be against
transparency.
k If you would rather preview your
image against something other than
the transparent checkerboard, choose
another option from the Display drop-
down list.
You can view the image against a
white, gray, black, or other colored

background. Or you can view it as a
mask. (If you view it as a mask, the
white areas represent the selected
areas and the black areas represent
the transparent areas.)
12.
If you’re not happy, choose a view
option before you start editing your
mask.
You can choose between the Original
and Extracted view from the Show
drop-down list. 
You can also select the Show Highlight
and Show Fill check boxes. 
13.
To do fine-tuned editing of your image,
you have the following tools at your
disposal:
 Drag with the Cleanup tool
(press C on the keyboard) to erase
background pixels around your
extraction by subtracting opacity.
Alt+drag (Option+drag on the Mac)
to bring the opacity back. This tool
is useful for creating feathered
edges. 
 The Edge Touchup tool (T is the key-
board shortcut) sharpens the edges
of the selection by adding opacity to
your selection or subtracting opacity
from the background. 
You can adjust the brush size of these
editing tools to get the best results. 
14.
When you finish editing, click OK to
exit the dialog box. If you still have
some areas that need some cleanup,
use Photoshop regular editing tools,
such as the Background Eraser and
the History Brush tools.

f you haven’t already checked out Book VI, Chapter 2, which
covers Photoshop’s quick and easy masking tools, you might
want to breeze through that chapter first, especially if the
word mask brings to mind an image from Halloween instead of
a selection technique. In this chapter, I dive into some manual
masking techniques.
Layer masks are tremendously useful, and if you’re like me,
you’ll find yourself addicted to them. They can be fantastic for
blending layers and making multiple images dissolve into one
another. Vector masks create shapes defined by vector paths
and produce clean, smooth-edged graphic elements.
Channel masks are probably the most time-consuming of the
masking lot, but they’re powerful and accurate. Like anything in
life, the more you practice using them, the faster and better
you get.
After you get through this final chapter of Book VI, you’ll be
familiar with every masking technique Photoshop has to offer.
By then, you’ll be prepared to use masks to select a very hairy
orangutan, dyed green, perched in a tree in a lush rainforest.
And how many people can say that?
Working with Layer Masks
Like any other mask, a layer mask is a grayscale image that you
can edit to your heart’s content. Layer masks are excellent for
blending layers of images together and creating soft transitions
between elements.
For versatility, layer masks are unparalleled. They allow you to
gradually brush in transparency and opacity on a selective
pixel basis. Paint with black to hide portions of the layer; paint

with white to display portions; and paint in varying shades of gray to partially show elements.
You can even apply gradients, image adjustments, and filters to your layer masks to create
interesting special effects.
After you get the concept of layer masks, you’ll never use the eraser tools (covered in Book VI,
Chapter 2) again. You won’t have to because one of the great things about layer masks is that
you can forever edit, or even delete them, with no permanent harm whatsoever to the image.
Creating layer masks
To create a layer mask, select your desired layer and choose Layer➪Add Layer Mask➪Reveal
All or Hide All.

Reveal All creates a mask filled with white, which shows the layer.

Hide All creates a mask filled with black, which hides, or masks, the layer and shows
nothing but transparency.
You can also click the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of Layers palette (which by default
selects Reveal All).
You can’t add a layer mask to a background layer. You must convert the background layer to
a regular layer if you want to use a layer mask on the background of an image.
You can also apply a layer mask. Choose your desired layer and make a selection using one
of the selection tools. Choose Layer➪Add Layer Mask➪Reveal Selection or Hide Selection.
You can also click on the New Layer Mask button in the Layers palette to create a mask that
reveals the selection.
After you create the layer mask, you can grab the painting tool of your choice and apply your
grayscale color. Remember: Add white to the mask to display the image. Add black to hide the
image. Add gray to make the image semi-transparent.
Using the Gradient and Brush tools on a Layer Mask
I must confess: I use two of the layer masking tools more than the others:

The Gradient tool, set to a linear gradient of black to white or white to black is truly
awesome. Simply drag the layer mask to create the gradient. The darker areas of the
gradient gradually hide the image, whereas the lighter areas gradually show the image.

The Brush tool, with a large, feathered tip, using the Airbrush option and the Flow set to
around 10% is amazing. With these settings in place, you can create feathered edges
that blend one layer into another without any harsh lines.
In Figure 3-1, which is an image with two layers, the flag on the bottom and the girl on top, I
used a combination of both these tools. I started with the black-to-white linear gradient,
which I dragged from the left edge of my image through to the right edge. I then took the
Brush tool with a large feathered tip (265 pixels), selected the Airbrush option, set the Flow to
10%, and worked my way around the profile of the girl’s face to get rid of some more of the
background behind her (see Figure 3-2).

To edit a layer mask, click the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers palette. Select your desired
painting or editing tool, and paint or edit the mask to perfection. Just be sure that you’re working
on the layer mask, instead of editing the image itself. Otherwise, you’ll apply paint directly to your
image. You can tell because you’ll see a layer mask icon next to the eye icon in the Layers palette.
Managing layer masks
Here are some tips to help you work with your layer masks. You can do the following:

Load a layer mask: Loading a layer mask means getting a selection outline based on the
layer mask. Simply Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) the layer mask thumbnail.

View the mask without viewing the image: Sometimes when you’re editing a layer
mask, you may find it helpful to see the mask itself without having to view the image,
too, as shown in Figure 3-3. Simply Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) the layer mask
thumbnail to view the mask and hide the image on the layer.
To redisplay the image, Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) again or click the eye icon
in the far left column.

View the layer mask as a red overlay: If you prefer to see your layer mask as a red
overlay (called a rubylith), Alt+Shift+click (Option+Shift+click on the Mac) the layer
mask thumbnail.

Click again with the same keys to remove the overlay: You can change the opacity and
color of the overlay in the Layer Mask Display Options dialog box, which you access by
double-clicking the layer mask channel in the Channels palette.

A rubylith is similar to the red overlay used with Quick Masks, covered in Book VI,
Chapter 2.

Paste a copied selection into a layer mask: Simply Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac)
the layer mask thumbnail. Choose Edit➪Paste and then Select➪Deselect. Click the
image thumbnail in the Layers palette to return to the image.
The copied selection can consist of anything, but this technique comes in particularly handy
when you’re copying one layer mask into another.

Disable (temporarily hide) or enable a layer mask: Just Shift+click the layer mask
thumbnail or choose Layer➪Disable Layer Mask or Enable Layer Mask.

Unlink a layer from its layer mask: By default, Photoshop links a layer mask to the con-
tents of the layer. This allows them to move together. To unlink a layer from its layer mask,
click the link icon in the Layers palette. Click again to re-establish the link.

Discard a layer mask: Just drag the layer mask thumbnail to the trash can icon in the
Layers palette. Click Discard in the dialog box. Or you can choose Layer➪Remove Layer
Mask➪Discard. 

Apply a layer mask: When you apply a layer mask, you fuse the mask to the image.
Photoshop replaces all black areas in the mask with transparent pixels and all gray areas
with partially transparent pixels; all white areas are image pixels. Drag the thumbnail to
the trash can icon in the Layers palette. Click Apply in the dialog box. Or you can choose
Layer➪Remove Layer Mask➪Apply.

Making a Photo Gradually Fade from Color to Grayscale
Layer masks are extremely powerful when
it comes to blending multiple images so
that one seems to dissolve into the others.
I’m not going to show you how to use a
layer mask to blend different images, but
rather the same image — one in color and
one in grayscale.
1.
Open a copy of your favorite color
image.
The subject matter isn’t critical
here, so feel free to whip out that
old prom picture.
2.

Accept the default name and click
OK in the dialog box.
3.
With the duplicate image active,
choose Window➪Channels.
d View each of the channels to find
the one that gives you the best
grayscale image.
If you need a refresher on channels,
see Book VI, Chapter 1. The Red
channel gives the best contrast for
the portrait in my example. Skin
tones tend to have a lot of red in
them, and the Red channel usually
provides the best grayscale image.

Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale
and click OK in the Adobe
Photoshop dialog box.

Photoshop has now stripped the
color from the image.
This is only one way to convert a
color image to grayscale. There
are others, usually yielding better
results — converting to Lab Color
mode, picking a single channel,
using the Channel Mixer. Check
them out in Book II, Chapter 2.
Feel free to choose your own
method.
f Choose Window➪Layers. With the
Move tool and holding down the
Shift key, drag and drop your
grayscale image onto your color
image.
This action automatically creates a
new layer from the grayscale image.
(See Book V for more information
about layers.)
By holding down the Shift key, you
keep the two images perfectly
aligned.
7.
Close your duplicate image.
8.
Press D for default colors.
This gives you a black foreground
swatch and a white background
swatch in your Toolbox (more 
formally known as the Tools
palette).
Now, I show you how to use one
of my favorite techniques, a black-
to-white gradient, on the layer 
mask.
9.
Make sure that Layer 1 is the active
layer in the Layers palette. Click
the Add Layer Mask icon at the
bottom of the palette.
It’s the icon that looks like a dark
square with a white circle on top.
Photoshop adds a second thumbnail
on your layer, indicating that a layer
mask has been applied.
A layer mask acts like a piece of clear
acetate over your layer.
10.
Select the Gradient tool. Then
select the default gradient of
Foreground to Background.
To get the default gradient, click
the Gradient picker in the Options
bar and select the first gradient. 
It should be a gradient of white to
black because it’s based on the cur-
rent foreground and background
colors, which reverse when you
select the Layer Mask thumbnail.
For a gradient refresher, see Book IV,
Chapter 3.
11.
Drag the gradient from the top of
your image to the bottom.
Or from left to right. Or at a diago-
nal. It’s your call.
l Experiment with long drags and
short drags. The angle and length
of your mouse movement deter-
mine how the layer mask reveals
the underlying image.
In my example, I dragged from the
top of the image to the bottom and
stopped about two-thirds of the way
down.
Where black appears on the layer
mask, the grayscale image is hidden.
Where white appears on the mask, the
grayscale image shows through and
everything in between allows the
grayscale image to partially show.
Although I used a linear gradient in
my example, you can experiment
with the other types as well. Radial
gradients can provide some interest-
ing effects.

Creating and Editing Vector Masks
Whereas layer masks let you create soft-edged masks, vector masks create hard-edged masks
defined by shapes created by a vector path on a layer. Vector-based shapes produce clean,
smooth, and well-defined edges that are never jagged. And you can size and transform vector
shapes without ever degrading the appearance of the element.
You create a vector mask when you create a shape with any one of the shape tools. You can
also create a vector mask when you convert type to a shape (Layer➪Type➪Convert to
Shape). See Book IV, Chapter 5.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Adding a vector mask to a layer
To add a vector mask to layer, follow these steps:
1.
Select the layer in the Layers palette
and choose Layer➪Add Vector
Mask➪Reveal All or Hide All.
I describe Reveal All and Hide All in the
“Creating layer masks” section.
2.
On the vector mask, create a path
with the Pen tool or grab any Shape
tool and create a shape.
See Book III, Chapter 2, for more on
paths and Book IV, Chapter 2, for more
on shapes.
I selected the Custom Shape tool and
dragged a sunburst shape on my
vector mask. Notice how everything
outside of the path is hidden, or
masked, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Like layer masks, you can add vector
masks only to layers, not backgrounds.
If necessary, simply convert your back-
ground to a layer by double-clicking 
background in the Layers palette.
3.
If your vector mask is satisfactory,
save your file and then close it.
Another way to add a vector mask is to
select your desired layer, draw a work
path with the Pen tool or one of the shape
tools, and then select Layer➪Add Vector
Mask➪Current Path.
Managing vector masks
Here are a few more vector mask tips. You can perform the following tasks:

Edit a vector mask path: Use the pen tools and the Direct Selection tool, as described
in Book III, Chapter 2.

Add multiple shapes or paths to the existing vector mask: All you need to do is just
drag another shape with any of the shape tools. Or add another path with the Pen tool.

Remove a vector mask from a layer: Drag the thumbnail to the trash can icon in the
Layers palette or choose Layer➪Delete Vector Mask.

Disable (temporarily hide) or enable a vector mask: Shift+click the vector mask
thumbnail or choose Layer➪Enable (or Disable) Vector Mask.

Rasterize a vector mask: Rasterizing (or turning the mask into a pixel-based image)
converts the vector mask into a layer mask. Choose Layer➪Rasterize➪Vector Mask.

Creating and Editing Vector Masks
505

Apply layer styles to vector shapes: This is a quick and easy way to create buttons for
a Web page or a custom logo, as shown in Figure 3-5. Just select the layer, not the vector
mask, and choose Layer➪Layer Style. Select your style of choice. For details on layer
styles see Book V, Chapter 4.

Creating Channel Masks
Photoshop’s channel masks are probably the most time-consuming masks to use because
they require a lot of manual labor. Not heavy lifting, mind you, but work with the tools and
commands in Photoshop.
But, don’t get me wrong, it’s time well spent. Channel masks can usually accurately select
what the other Photoshop tools can only dream about — wisps of hair, tufts of fur, a ficus 
benjamina tree with 9,574 leaves.
There are lots of ways to create a channel mask, but I’m here to offer you one that works most
of the time. To create a channel mask, follow these steps:
Figure 3-5
1.
Analyze your existing channels to
find a suitable candidate to use to
create a duplicate channel.
This is usually the channel with the
most contrast between what you want
and don’t want. For instance, in my
example, the Red channel provided the
most contrast between the tree and
lanterns, which I wanted to mask, and
the background, which I didn’t.
After you duplicate the channel, it then
becomes an alpha channel.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Masking Hair, Fur, and Other Wispy Things
Hair, fur, fuzz, and other objects with com-
plex or loosely defined edges can prove
difficult to select with the run-of-the-mill
selection techniques. But that’s where
masking can save the day. Because a
mask allows for a 256-level selection,
it does a great job in picking up those 
illusive strands of hair and such that
would otherwise probably be cut off in
the selecting process.
Perhaps you’ve seen those photos where
everyone in a composite image appears to
have helmet hair? Here are the steps to
avoid the Aqua Net look and select even
the smallest wisp of hair:
1.
Choose File➪Open.
Select an image that contains some-
thing hairy, furry, or fuzzy. A portrait
is an ideal choice (unless it’s a por-
trait of Telly Savalas).
For your first attempt at this technique,
it is best to start with an image that
has a pretty simple and uncluttered
background. 
In my example, I used an image of a
pensive, young urban professional.
2.
Choose View➪Channels. View each
channel by clicking the channel
name.
Each channel is an independent
grayscale image. Each of the chan-
nels in the document is a potential
starting point for a mask.
It is best to start with the channel
that contains the most contrast

between what you want to select
and what you don’t. If it’s a toss-up,
go with the channel that will make
selecting the difficult part of the
image easiest (in my example, that’s
the hair).
In my example, I’m using the Blue
channel.
c Choose the Duplicate channel from
the Channels palette pop-up menu.
Name the channel mask and
click OK.
You’ve created an alpha channel for
the mask. Now you can edit the
mask without harming the original
channel.
d Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels
and boost the contrast in the image
by adjusting the Input sliders for
Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights.
If you need help using the Levels
adjustment, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
5.
Select the person and his or her
hair.
You can do that one of two ways:
 By selecting the person.
 By selecting the background first
and then inverting the selection.
In a mask, traditionally white 
represents a selected area, black
represents an unselected area,
and gray represents a partially
selected area. 
6.
Adjust the Levels settings by drag-
ging your shadows, midtones and
highlights sliders so that the ele-
ment you want to select is either all
white or all black with a little gray
in the wispy areas. In other words,
you want to change most of the
pixels in the image to either black
or white.
In my example, because my guy
is darker than the background,
I adjusted the contrast to make
the subject as black as I could
while making the background
lighter.

7.
If you think the edges of your
image need to be accentuated,
you can apply a High Pass filter
(Filter➪Other➪High Pass) before
you apply the Level adjustment.
High Pass turns your overall image
gray while leaving the edges white.
Don’t use too low a radius value
(start with a setting between 8 and
10) or completing the mask will be
too time-consuming.
8.
Refine the mask by selecting the
Eraser tool and choosing Block
Mode from the Options bar.
The Block Eraser is a great tool for
cleaning up masks. It allows you to
paint inside the mask without creating
any feathered edges.
9.
Press D for default colors.
Remember the Eraser tool paints
with the background color, so be
sure you have the color you want
before you drag. Press X to switch
the foreground and background
colors.
j Clean up your mask by painting
with black and white.
Make sure to use short strokes so
you can undo any mistakes you
make. 
11.
Use the Zoom tool if you need to
touch up the details.
The Block Eraser tool has only one
size, so you have to zoom in to paint
thinner strokes and zoom out to
erase a larger area.
Remember to leave some gray
around the wispy areas; otherwise,
they may look chopped off. 
Take your time and be as accurate
as you can. This is where patience
makes a big difference.
If you’re not sure what you need to
paint on the mask and you want to
refer to the color image, simply click
the composite channel (either RGB or
CMYK depending on your image) at
the top of the Channels palette. Then
click the mask channel again to return
to your mask. Or better yet, you can
view both the mask and the composite
simultaneously. Your mask appears as
a red overlay.
Your mask is refined and ready to go.
12.
Click the first icon on the left at the
bottom of the Channels palette to
load the mask as a selection (or
Ctrl+click [Ô+click on the Mac] the
channel mask).
A selection marquee appears around
your mask.
If you want to soften the edge a little,
you can choose Select➪Feather and
enter a value somewhere between .5
pixel (for a low-resolution image) to 2
pixels (for a high-resolution image).
Feathering allows for a softer, natural-
looking transition between your
masked element and the background.
I used a 1-pixel feather for my image.
13.
Return to the composite image by
clicking the RGB channel (or CMYK
if warranted).

tion, choose Select➪Inverse.
In my example, I just filled my back-
ground with a solid color, so I left
the background selected.

Edit➪Fill, choose Foreground
Color for your Contents, and

Photoshop now replaces the back-

16.
Make any final edits you need to
make.
My guy looked like he spent too
much time at the local tanning booth,
so I toned down the redness in his
skin by using the Variation com-
mands (see Book VIII, Chapter 1).
17.
When you’re happy with your chan-
nel mask, save and close the file.
It takes practice to get masking
down to a science, but believe me,
it’s worth your time. Nine times out
of ten, a channel mask lends a much
better selection than any of the
easier, quicker selection tools and
techniques.
Instead of filling the background with a
color, you can also open a second image
and, with the Move tool, drag and drop
your masked element into the second
image. A couple of things to keep in
mind when compositing with two
images: First try to use two images
whose lighting isn’t so dissimilar that it
looks artificial. Take into account the
time of day, the angle of the light, and
so on. Secondly, try to select two images
whose levels of focus make sense. If you
need to soften one of the images, apply
the Gaussian Blur filter. If your mask is
good, your person should look right at
home in his or her new digs.

Filters and Distortions


F
ilters have a long and glorious history, ranging from per-
forming essential tasks like removing abrasive particles
from the oil in your car’s crankcase to even more impor-
tant chores involving the pixels in your Photoshop images. In
both cases, filters seize tiny, almost invisible, bits of stuff and
rearrange them in useful ways. The results are something you’d
never want to do without.
Within Photoshop, filters (also called plug-ins because they can
be installed or removed from Photoshop independently) can
help you in many ways. They correct imperfect images, improve
your best photos, or transform an object from one thing into
another. Filters can mimic artistic painting styles, blur things
that are too sharp, sharpen things that are too blurry, or create
brand new objects (like clouds) that didn’t exist before. This
chapter introduces you to the basics of Photoshop’s filter facili-
ties and starts you on the road to plug-in proficiency.
Just because all filters are plug-ins doesn’t mean that all
plug-ins are filters. You’ll find plenty of plug-ins out there
that have nothing to do with filters — or image editing, for
that matter.
You Say You Want a Convolution?
All filters do one simple thing in a seemingly complicated way:
They make Photoshop do your bidding. Deep within a filter’s
innards is a set of instructions that tells Photoshop what to do
with a particular pixel in an image or selection. Photoshop
applies these instructions to each and every pixel in the relevant
area by using a process the techies call convolution (creating a
form or shape that’s folded or curved in tortuous windings), but
which we normal folk simply refer to as applying a filter.

Corrective and destructive filters
Filters fall into two basic categories, corrective and destructive:

Corrective filters fix problems in an image. They fine-tune color, add blur, improve
sharpness, or remove nastiness like dust and scratches. Although corrective plug-ins
can be fairly destructive to certain pixels, in general, they don’t change the basic look of
an image. You might not even notice that a corrective filter has been applied unless you
compare the new version of the image with the original.

Destructive filters tend to obliterate at least some of an image’s original detail (some to
a greater extent than others) as they add special effects. They may overlay an image
with an interesting texture, move pixels around to create brush strokes, simulate light
and shadow to create 3-D illusions, or distort an image with twists, waves, or zigzags.
You’ll often be able to tell at a glance that a destructive filter has been applied to an
image: The special effect often looks like nothing that exists in real life.
An unaltered image (such as the image on the left in Figure 1-1) can be improved by using a
corrective filter such as Unsharp Mask (center) or changed dramatically with a destructive
filter such as Find Edges (right).
Filter basics
Whether a filter is corrective or destructive, it is one of a couple of flavors — boring or super
cool. (I made these names up myself. Can you tell?) Seriously, here’s the scoop:

Single-step filters: The easiest filters to use, single-step filters have no options and use
no dialog boxes. Just choose the filter from the menu and watch it do its stuff on your
image or selection. The basic Blur and Sharpen filters are single-step filters. So is the
Invert filter, which I describe a bit later in this chapter.

Mini-application filters: Most filters come complete with at least one dialog box, per-
haps a few lists, buttons, and check boxes. And almost every mini-app filter has sliders
you can use to adjust the intensity of an effect or parameter (see Figure 1-2). These fil-
ters are marked in the menus with an ellipsis (series of dots) following their names so
that, like other menu commands with those dots, you’ll know that there’s more to come.
The controls themselves are easy to master. The tricky part is learning what the various
parameters you’re using actually do. How does changing brush size affect your image when
using a brush stroke filter? What happens when you select a particular pattern with a texturiz-
ing filter? You can read descriptions of how various filter controls affect your image, but your
Figure 1-1

Using Filters
517
best bet is to simply experiment until you discover the effects and parameters that work best
for you. Just be sure that you save a copy of the original image; filters do permanent damage
to files — modifying, adding, and deleting pixels.
Most filters include a preview window, but some, particularly those from third-party vendors,
may require you to select a Preview option to activate the display. Other filters have an
option for previewing the effect in the entire image, rather than just in the filter dialog box’s
preview window. That’s because those particular filters use enough computer resources that
constant updates take some time. The filter operates more quickly with the full preview
turned off. However, if you have a speedy computer and aren’t working with humongous
files, the preview delay is probably negligible. 
Using Filters
You have tons of different types of filters to choose from. Photoshop has 13 different cate-
gories and roughly 100 filters that do things like sharpening and blurring your image, adding
brush strokes, distorting, creating textures, and creating other effects. You’ll find a complete
description of all the categories and what they do in Book VII, Chapter 2.
The simplest filter to understand and use is one that’s not even found in the Filter menu: The
Invert filter, a single-step filter, isn’t in the Filter menu because, technically, it really isn’t a
filter, but it illustrates nicely what filters do to your images. (Find it at Image➪Adjustments➪
Invert.)
When you apply Invert to an image, Photoshop examines each pixel and immediately flips it to
its opposite in tone and color. A black pixel becomes a white pixel, a dark gray pixel becomes
a light gray pixel, and a dark red pixel becomes a light cyan pixel. (For more information on
the relationship between colors, see Book II, Chapter 2.) While this filter flips grayscale pixels
to their exact opposite, if you want to turn a color negative into a positive, you have to do
some manual adjusting after the inversion. 
Figure 1-2

Book VII  Chapter 1: Making Corrections with Daily Filters
518
Actually, you can use many other filters to do much the same thing. Based on the information
in your image, pixels are lightened, darkened, changed in color, or moved around from place
to place as the filter changes contrast, blurs, sharpens, corrects color, or distorts your image.
Some other filters, (such as the Clouds filter, which I discuss in Book VII, Chapter 2), ignore
image information, but they change pixels in similar ways based on their own internal rules.
Sharpening What’s Soft
Sometimes your images aren’t as sharp as you’d like. Sometimes your images have a tiny bit
of softening caused when scanning an image or perhaps, when capturing a photo on your
digital camera. Or, perhaps, you want only a particular part to be sharper so that it stands
out from its surroundings.
All sharpening tools operate by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. If you look at
a sharpened image side by side with the original version (as shown in Figure 1-3), you’ll see
that no new information has been provided. Instead, the contrast is boosted so that edges are
more distinct. The dark parts of the edges are darker, and the light parts at their boundaries
are lighter.
Photoshop has five main sharpening tools, only four of which are actually filters. I discuss the
four that are filters in the following sections. The fifth, the Sharpen tool, isn’t a filter, strictly
speaking. It’s more like a paintbrush that lets you sharpen areas selectively by using strokes.
The sharpening filters give you more control because you can easily apply them to selections
that you carefully craft. Three of the four sharpen filters are single-step filters that you can
apply quickly without resorting to dialog boxes.
Sharpen
The Sharpen filter is best used for minimal touchups in small areas. Enable this filter by
choosing Filter➪Sharpen➪Sharpen.
Unsharpened
Sharpened
Figure 1-3

Sharpening What’s Soft
519
This single-step filter increases the contrast between all the pixels in the image or selection.
Although this makes the image look sharper, it can add a grainy look to solid areas that aren’t
part of the edges.
Sharpen More
Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Sharpen More to use the Sharpen More filter, a single-step filter that
increases the contrast between all the pixels even more than the regular Sharpen filter. Like
the Sharpen filter, Sharpen More is best relegated to non-critical sharpening because it 
doesn’t do a very good job of sharpening large areas. Also, it doesn’t provide the control
you need for more intense projects.
Sharpen Edges
The Sharpen Edges filter (choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Sharpen Edges) is a single-step filter that’s
superior to the Sharpen and Sharpen More filters because it concentrates its efforts on the
edges of images, adding sharpness without making the image grainy or noisy. Still, it, too, is
best used for quickie fixes.
Unsharp Mask
Don’t feel bad. Everyone is confused by the Unsharp Mask filter’s name the first time they
encounter it. (Find this filter by choosing Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.) This filter provides
a sophisticated attempt to duplicate a sophisticated photographic effect called unsharp mask-
ing, in which two sheets of film are sandwiched together to create a final image. One sheet is
the original film negative (or a duplicate), and the second is a positive image (the “normal”
photograph) that’s blurred slightly.
When the two are mated together, the light and dark areas cancel each other out, except at
the edges — because of the blurring of the positive mask, which causes the edges to spread
at those points.
Unsharp masking is a tricky procedure in the darkroom. It’s much more precise in the digital
realm because Photoshop can easily control the width of the areas to be masked, as well as a
relative brightness level to use before beginning to apply the masking effect. The filter’s dialog
box is shown in Figure 1-4. After looking at the top image in Figure 1-5, don’t you feel like you
need glasses when you see the bottom image?
Scanned images almost always benefit from a little unsharp masking, but you should be con-
servative and not overdo things. That’s especially true because two out of three of the
Unsharp Mask controls are not the sort you can apply intuitively. The Radius and Threshold
sliders work best when you’ve had some experience using Unsharp Mask. However, the
Amount slider is a bit easier to work with. Here’s how to use each of these controls:

Amount: Use this control to vary the amount of edge sharpening. Your choices range
from 1 percent to 500 percent. For subtle amounts of sharpening, anything around 100
percent or less provides the effect you’re looking for without making the image appear
overly contrasty (yes, that is a technical term) or unrealistic.

Blurring What’s Sharp
521
Sharpening always increases contrast, so you should use any of the Sharpening tools before
trying other contrast-adjusting tools. When you’ve sharpened your image to your satisfac-
tion, you can then use the other contrast controls to fine-tune the image with additional con-
trast (if it’s still required).

Radius: This slider controls the width (in pixels) of the edges, that the Unsharp Mask filter
will modify. Your range varies from 0.1 pixel (for fine control) to 250 pixels (for broader
sharpening effects). Your use of this control will vary chiefly on the resolution of your origi-
nal image. Low-resolution images (100 pixels per inch and lower) look best when you use
only a small radius value, from a fraction of a pixel up to three or four pixels.
A small amount of sharpening may produce no visible effect on high-resolution images,
especially those with 300 ppi resolution or more. You may need to move the slider to
the 5-pixel range before you see any effects. Regardless of the resolution of your image,
setting the radius too high emphasizes the edges of your image unrealistically, and
boosts the contrast too much.
A good rule to consider when you select a radius is to divide your image’s ppi resolution by
150 and then adjust from there. For example, if you have a 150 ppi image, set the radius at 1
and then tweak from there.

Threshold: This slider controls the difference in brightness between adjacent pixels
that must be present before the edge is sharpened. That is, you need to have a distinct
contrast between adjacent pixels along an edge in order to sharpen the edge. Your
choices range from brightness values of 0 to 255. Selecting a low value causes edges
with very little contrast difference to be emphasized (which is usually what you want).
You’re usually better off leaving this control at 0 unless your image has a lot of noise.
Higher values force Photoshop to provide edge sharpening only when adjacent pixels
are dramatically different in brightness. Increasing the threshold too much can cause
some harsh transitions between sharpened and unsharpened pixels.
In most cases, the Amount and Radius sliders are the only controls you need to use.
Threshold is most useful when the first two controls create excessive noise in the image. You
can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the Threshold level a little.
Blurring What’s Sharp
What, me blurry? The answer is yes, if you have an image that contains unwanted grain (the
roughness or noise added by the photographic film) or, perhaps, an objectionable pattern of
halftone dots used in a printed image.
You might need to blur a background to make the foreground seem sharper, or blur a portion
of an image to create an angelic glow. Here are your blurring options (all found in the Filter➪
Blur menu):

Average: This single-step filter calculates the average value (or color) of the image or
selection and fills the area with that average value. This can be useful for smoothing the
values of areas containing a lot of noise.

Blur: Also a single-step filter, Blur provides overall blurring of an image.

Blur More: This filter provides a significantly increased amount of blurring than the reg-
ular, old-fashioned Blur filter.

Gaussian Blur: This filter offers a radius control to let you adjust the amount of blurring
more precisely. It’s also got a really cool name.
Book
VII
Chapter

Book VII  Chapter 1: Making Corrections with Daily Filters
522
The Gaussian Blur filter is an excellent tool because it gives you a great deal of control over
the amount and type of blurring you get. That’s especially true when compared to the
single-step filters Blur and Blur More, which apply a fixed amount of blur. Use these latter
two filters when you simply want to de-sharpen an image a tad, and turn to Gaussian Blur
when you’re looking for a specific effect.

Lens Blur: This filter simulates the blurring that can occur when you capture an image
with a camera. For details, see the sidebar, “Applying the Lens Blur filter.”
The Average filter and the Lens Blur filter are new to Photoshop CS.

Motion Blur: This filter simulates the blur you see in objects that are moving.

Radial Blur: This filter produces the kind of blur you might get when photographing a
revolving automobile tire.

Smart Blur: This filter lets you control how Photoshop applies the blur to edges and
other details of the image.
If you’ve ever played with the aperture settings
on a camera, you’re probably well aware that you
can determine how shallow or deep your depth
of field is. Depth of field relates to the plane of
focus, or how in focus the foreground elements
are in relationship to the background elements.
If you use a Lens Blur filter on an alpha channel
(see Book VI, Chapter 1 for more on alpha chan-
nels), the alpha channel acts as a depth map. This
is a great for taking a fully focused image and cre-
ating a shallow depth of field where the foremost
object is in focus and the background elements
gets blurrier the farther they are from the focal
point. You can achieve this by creating an alpha
channel filled with a white to black gradient —
white where you want the most focus and black
where you want the least focus or most blur.
Here is a brief description on setting the Lens
Blur filter options:
 Source: If you have an alpha channel, select
it from this pop-up menu. The Lens Blur
option interprets the various grayscale values
of the alpha channel and applies the blur
according to the value set in the Blur Focus
Distance. Choose Transparency to make an
image get blurrier as it gets more transpar-
ent. Choose Layer Mask to apply the blur
according the grayscale values on the layer
mask (see Book VI, Chapter 3 for more on
layer masks). If your image contains none of
these options, choose None. Photoshop
applies the blur on the image.
 Blur Focal Distance: Specifies how blurry
or in focus an area of the image will be.
Photoshop places the grayscale values less
than the value specified in front of the plane
of the focus, and those greater than the value
specified in back. Drag the slider to specify
the value or click the crosshair cursor on the
part of the image you want to be in full focus.
 Iris: The Iris settings are meant to simulate a
camera lens. Specify the shape of the lens, as
well as the radius (size of the iris), curvature,
and rotation of that shape.
 Specular Highlights: The Lens Blur filter
averages the highlights of an image, which, left
uncorrected, cause some highlights to appear
grayish. These controls help to retain specular
highlights, or those highlights, which should
appear very white. Set the Threshold value to
specify which highlights should be specular, or
remain white. Set a Brightness value to spec-
ify how much to re-lighten any blurred areas.
 Noise: Blurring, of course, obliterates any
noise, or film grain, an image may have. This
can cause the image to appear inconsistent
or unrealistic in many cases. Drag the slider
to add noise back into your image.
Applying the Lens Blur filter

Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
523
Smoothing with the Facet and Median Filters
One application for blurring an image is to reduce dust and scratches, or to smooth away
sharp edges. For an example of the Dust & Scratches filter, see Book VII, Chapter 2. You’ll also
find information on Photoshop’s Despeckle filter there. Here, I show you how to use the versa-
tile Facet and Median filters to soften an image.
Although the Facet and Median filters smooth images by eliminating some detail, you can
compensate for the blurring effect by applying Unsharp Mask with a low radius setting to
sharpen things up a little.
The Facet filter
Facet breaks up an image using a posterizing effect. It gathers up blocks of pixels that are simi-
lar in brightness and converts them to a single value using geometric shapes. (When you pos-
terize an image, you reduce it to a very small number of tones.)
The geometric shapes make the image look more randomly produced, while eliminating much
of the banding effect you get with conventional posterizing filters.
The effects of the Facet filter are subtle, and best viewed close-up. The original image in Figure
1-6 contains some dust, scratches, and a few other defects. Instead of retouching them one by
one, I used Facet.
Figure 1-6
Book
VII
Chapter

Book VII  Chapter 1: Making Corrections with Daily Filters
524
Facet is a single-step filter, so you don’t need to adjust any controls. Just choose Filter➪
Pixelate➪Facet and evaluate your results. You can apply the filter multiple times. However,
even one application smoothes out the picture and eliminates the worst of the artifacts, as
shown in Figure 1-7.
If you apply the Facet filter multiple times, your image will take on a pointillist, stroked look
that becomes obvious. Maybe you wouldn’t frame Figure 1-8, but using the filter again and
again can yield quite interesting special effects. For more on creating painterly looks with
filters, see Book VII, Chapter 2.
The Median filter
The Median filter (look for it in the Filter➪Noise menu) operates similarly to the Facet filter in
that it reduces the difference between adjacent pixels by changing the values of some of them.
In this case, it assigns the median values of a group of pixels to the center pixel in the group.
Unlike the Facet filter, the Median filter gives you a bit of control. You can choose the radius of
the group that Photoshop will use to calculate the median value.
As you can see in Figure 1-9, Median tends to make an image look a bit blurrier because it
reduces the contrast of adjacent pixels. However, it does a good job of smoothing the image
and removing artifacts.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Creating an Angelic Glow
Sometimes, a little blur can add a soft,
romantic mood or angelic glow that can
improve glamour photos, pictures of kids,
or even something as mundane as a flower.
The secret is to apply only enough blur-
ring to provide the soft effect you want
without completely obliterating your origi-
nal subject. This assumes, of course, that
your subject doesn’t deserve obliteration,
that the kids are your own (or those of a
close friend or relative), and are, in fact, of
that rare angelic variety.
You won’t want to use this effect on other
subjects, such as men, who generally like a
rugged, masculine appearance (minus any
hint of an angelic glow). Many senior citi-
zens regard the age lines on their faces as
badges of distinction earned over a long,
rewarding life. Don’t try softening them up
with glowing effects, either.
This Putting-It-Together project combines
Gaussian Blur with the Photoshop Opacity
feature (which enables you to easily make
one layer partially transparent so that the
one underneath shows through) and the
Merge Layers mode. I chose an image of a
young girl. The original photo isn’t bad,
but I wanted to make the girl’s face glow
with an inner life of its own.
To add an angelic glow to your little angel,
just follow these steps:
a Open the image in Photoshop.
2.
Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer to
create a copy of the image layer.
3.
Select Image➪Filter➪Blur➪
Gaussian Blur.
Gaussian Blur softens the upper
layer, producing an airy glow.
d Move the Radius slider to the right
to produce a moderate amount of
blur, and then click OK to apply
the blurring effect.

6.
Use the Opacity slider (click the
right-pointing arrow to access the

glow (if it’s too much for your taste).
I reduced my Opacity to 65%.
g Choose Layer➪Flatten Image to
combine all the layers.
Experiment with different amounts
of Gaussian Blur until you find the
perfect glowing effect.
When Photoshop applies the Lighten
mode as it merges two layers, it looks at
each pixel in the top layer and its corre-
sponding pixel in the layer below it.
That pixel in the final merged layer is
always the lighter of the two. The result
is an image in which Photoshop replaces
darker pixels with lighter ones, but
doesn’t change the light pixels at all.
Applying a Filter Again
You can reapply the last filter you worked with, using the same settings, by pressing Ctrl+F
(Ô+F on the Mac). (It’s also the first command in the Filter menu.) You might want to do this
to strengthen the effect of a filter on a particular image, layer, or selection. Or you simply may
want to apply the same filter to a succession of images or selections.
To bring up the dialog box for the last filter you applied, press Ctrl+Alt+F (Windows) or
Ô+Option+F (Mac). This shortcut can be very useful when you apply a filter and decide you
want to go back and use different settings. After applying the filter, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on a

Book VII  Chapter 1: Making Corrections with Daily Filters
528
Mac) to undo, and then press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on a Mac) to bring up the filter’s dialog
box. The dialog box opens up with the settings you used last time, allowing you to make
adjustments and reapply the filter.
Fading a Filter
Sometimes you may not want the full effects of a filter applied to your image or selection.
Photoshop has a handy Fade Filter facility that lets you control the intensity of the filter’s
effects. You can access this feature by choosing Edit➪Fade, or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+F
(Shift+Ô+F on the Mac). The dialog box in Figure 1-10 appears.
The Fade Filter facility also has a Preview option so that you can preview the changes you’re
making to the original image.
You must fade your filter immediately after you use the filter. If you use a painting or editing
tool after the filter, for example, you won’t find Fade Filter in the Edit menu anymore.
Photoshop replaces it with Fade Brush or something else.
You can also add a fade effect in the following ways:

Adjust opacity settings: Just about every filter allows you to adjust opacity, so most of
the time the Opacity slider is all you need to adjust the strength of the filter applied to
your image.

Use a blending mode: Use one of the blend modes in Photoshop to merge the filter
effect with the original image. For more on blend modes, see Book V, Chapter 3.

Apply a filter to a duplicate layer or a selection on that layer: Then adjust the opacity
of the filtered layer so that it merges with the unfiltered layer below it.
One of the advantages to this method is that you can selectively erase portions of the
filtered image to allow the unaltered portion to show through. For example, you can
apply a blur filter to a face to smooth out a complexion, and then erase the blurred
portion that covers the eyes.
You could just select the face (minus the eyes) and blur only that with the filter, but
using multiple layers gives you more flexibility. You can also fade a filter by using a
layer mask to selectively hide or show the filtered area. Find out more about layer
masks in Book VI, Chapter 3.

Selectively Applying a Filter
You don’t need to apply filters to an entire image or entire layer. You can achieve some of the
best effects when you apply a filter to only a portion of an image, say to an object in the fore-
ground, but not on the background. Your choices include

Selections: Make a selection and apply the filter only to that selection. You can use
Quick Mask mode (see Book VI, Chapter 2 for more information on Quick Mask) to paint
a selection. This technique can give you a high degree of control; it even lets you
feather the edges of the selection so that the filter effect fades out.

Channels: You can store selections as alpha channels, visible in the Channels palette, of
course. But you can also choose to apply a filter only to one of the other channels, such
as the Red, Green, or Blue channels in an RGB image. This is a good way to create a
filter effect that’s applied to only one color in an image. (Check out Book VI, Chapter 1
for information about channels.)

Moiré is caused when two patterns with differ-
ent frequencies are overlaid on each other. The
original halftone screen pattern used a series of
repeating lines, probably somewhere between
85 and 133 lines per inch. When you scan a
halftone, a second pattern results when the
image is displayed on your computer screen (at,
say, 72 to 120 “lines” per inch) or printed again
(at 300 to 600 dots per inch). The two patterns
interfere with each other at regular intervals,
producing the unpleasant moiré look. 
That’s a moiré
PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Sprucing Up a Scanned Halftone
Publications such as newspapers and mag-
azines use only a limited number of ink
colors to reproduce a photograph. Every
tone you see in a black-and-white image
must be reproduced by using pure black
ink and the white (okay, dirty beige) of the
paper. Full-color images are represented
by combining CMYK (cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black). Printers (both the
commercial kind and the kind that sits on
your desktop) can’t use various shades of
gray ink to create grayscale photos. They
also can’t use different strengths of color
inks to generate the rainbow of hues you
see in an image on-screen. Instead, photo-
graphs have to be converted to a series of
dots in order to be printed.

Our eyes blend the dots together to pro-
duce the illusion of a grayscale or color
image with smooth gradations of tone.
However, a problem arises if you want to
reuse a photograph and don’t have access
to the original. Scanners can capture the
halftone dots, but the resulting image usu-
ally has an unpleasant pattern, called moiré.
You have several ways of reducing the
moiré effect, usually by blurring the image
so that the dots merge and the underlying
pattern vanishes. Many scanners have a
descreen setting that partially eliminates
the effect, but that setting may actually
blur your image more than you’d like.
Fortunately, you can usually do better in
Photoshop.
In the following steps, I demonstrate an
easier way. Over the years I managed to
lose the original negative and print. You
can see the dreadful moiré pattern that
results when I scanned the clip.
To rid your scanned halftone print of both-
ersome moiré, follow these steps:
1.
Open the image in Photoshop.
b Zoom in so that you can see the
halftone pattern clearly as you
work.
c Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
The Gaussian Blur dialog box
appears.
4.
Move the Radius slider to the right
until the halftone pattern is
blurred, and then click OK to
apply the blur.
I used a value of 1.7 pixels.
5.
Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp
Mask to restore some of the
image’s sharpness now that you’ve
eliminated the pattern.
As long as the Radius value for the
Unsharp Mask filter doesn’t exceed
the radius of the Gaussian Blur that
you first applied, the two filters won’t
cancel each other out. You want the
sharpening to make the details of the
image crisper without bringing back
those blurred halftone dots.

f Move the Amount slider to the
right to sharpen the image.
A setting of roughly 166 percent will
do the job without making the image
appear unnaturally sharp or have
too much contrast.
When working with your own photos,
you may need to use different Radius
and Threshold values. In most cases,
leaving the Threshold at 0 is fine.
Calculate a starting Radius value by
dividing the ppi (pixels per inch) of
the scanned image by 150. If a moiré
pattern reappears, reduce the Radius
value.

P
hotoshop has dozens of filters that let you enhance your
image in unusual ways. You can create Old Masters por-
traits from common snapshots, shatter your image into a
thousand sparkling pieces, create clouds in a cloudless sky,
create stained glass, or perform hundreds of other tricks.
The big challenge in using these filters is learning what each
filter can do and how to apply it to the best effect. This chapter
introduces you to some more of those fabulous Photoshop
plug-ins and shows you some typical applications for them.
There are several Putting-It-Together projects with step-by-step
instructions. For the first few examples, I provide you with the
settings I used to achieve a particular look. However, filter
effects vary greatly when applied to different images, so you’ll
have to play with the filter controls yourself when you use
these techniques with your own images.
You can apply a filter to a layer, a selection, or a channel.
And you can also fade a filter, change opacity settings, and
use layer masks to soften the effects of filters. In fact, in
some cases, you may have to decrease the effect of a filter
because full strength can look overdone. On the other
hand, when applied selectively, the same filter may look
subtle and sophisticated. Although filters can be a blast to
play with, you want to exercise some restraint when apply-
ing them for a real project. Getting carried away with the
effects is easy when often the simplest effect is the most
beautiful.

Working in the Filter Gallery
Photoshop CS has efficiently consolidated several categories of filters into the Filter Gallery (a
dialog box-like gizmo that Adobe refers to as an “editing window”). Choose Filter➪Filter
Gallery. The mega Filter Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1. Here, you can
apply multiple filters as well as edit or delete them later. This great new feature has given the
world of filter application increased flexibility and user friendliness.
Here are the steps to get you up and running in the Filter Gallery:

trating the filter’s effect accompanies
each filter. To collapse the filter cate-
gory folder, simply click it again.

Select the filter you want to apply.
You can also choose your filter from the
filter pop-up menu, shown in Figure 2-1.
3.
Specify any settings associated with
the filter.
Note that you get a large preview of
your image in the left side of the dialog

When you are happy with the filter,
click OK to apply the filter and exit
the dialog box.

Here are some other helpful tips to keep in mind when using the Filter Gallery:

To delete an applied filter, select it and click the Delete Effect Layer button (the trash
can icon).

To edit an applied filter’s settings, select it in the list and make any necessary changes.
Click OK to reapply. Note that while you can edit a particular filter’s settings, that edit
will affect any subsequent filters you have made after applying that particular filter.

You can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Simply select and drag the filter up or
down within the list. Be aware that rearranging the order of the applied filters changes
the resulting effect of the filters.

To resize the Filter Gallery dialog box, drag the lower-right corner.

To hide the Filter menu and provide the maximum real estate for the preview box, click
the arrow to the left of the OK button.

Note that you can also choose any of the filters found in the Filter Gallery from the
Filter menu itself. The Filter Gallery dialog box automatically launches. Although, note
that not all filters are available in the Filter Gallery. Some have to be accessed individu-
ally from the Filter menu.
Getting Artsy
Quite a few of the Photoshop filters produce artistic effects. You’ll find a large collection of
them in the Sketch and Stylize submenus. However, the Artistic menu contains 15 versatile fil-
ters that you can use to add brush strokes to your images, wrap them in plastic, create
poster-like effects, and manufacture other interesting looks.
Many Photoshop veterans use these filters to create images that look as if they were painted.
What the vets might not tell you, unless pressed, is that artsy filters can make terrible photos
look okay or even great. These filters can disguise a multitude of photographic sins, turning
shoebox rejects into prize-winning digital transformations.
This photo of a duck (see Figure 2-2) has several problems, but the worst of them is that it’s
blurry because the camera moved while I was trying to follow the fast-paced duck. (That’s
why both the duck and the background are blurry.) On the surface, there appears to be no
way to salvage this image.

If you want to apply another filter,
click the New Effects Layer button at
the bottom of the dialog box. This
duplicates the existing filter. Choose
your new filter, which then replaces
the duplicates. 
Photoshop lists each of the filters you
apply to the image in the bottom right
of the dialog box. 
6.
When you’re done, click OK to apply
the second filter and exit the dialog
box.
Remember you can apply as many
filters as you want to your image
(although you don’t want to). Often
less is more.

You can fix that. Really, I mean it. Just try the following filters:

Poster Edges filter: A quick application of this filter (choose Filter➪Artistic➪Poster
Edges) improves the photo 100 percent. (See Figure 2-3.) The filter not only gives the
picture an artsy poster-like look, but also enhances the  edges to make the duck’s out-
line appear sharper.
I set the Poster Edges filter’s Edge Thickness to 4, bumped the Edge Intensity up to a
value of 6 to create dramatic-looking edges, and set the Posterization level to 6 to allow
more tones for a bit more realism.

The Dry Brush filter: This filter (choose Filter➪Artistic➪Dry Brush) can add an even
more stylistic effect, reducing the duck’s shape to a series of broad brush strokes, as
shown in Figure 2-4. I used a large brush size (9), set the amount of Brush Detail almost
to the maximum (9), and used the most Texture possible (3).
Some of the other useful artsy filters you’ll find in Photoshop’s repertoire are located in the
Artistic submenu. Just choose Filter➪Artistic to find them.

Colored Pencil: This filter crosshatches the edges of your image to create a pencil-like
effect.
You can also get a crosshatching effect when you use the Colored Pencil in areas of flat color.


Cutout: This effect assembles an image from what looks like cut-out paper shapes. This
effect looks kind of like a kid’s art project.

Film Grain: This photographic effect diffuses an image with thousands of tiny dots that
simulate clumps of film grain. Think old home movies.

Fresco: This effect looks (supposedly) like pigments applied to fresh, wet plaster. I
guess . . . if you squint.

Paint Daubs: This effect uses smears of color from your choice of a half-dozen different
brush types. Very Jackson Pollock.

Plastic Wrap: This filter can produce a wet look, particularly when you apply it to a
selection and then fade the filter so that it doesn’t overpower the detail in your image.

Watercolor: This is a nice pastel effect that diffuses an image while adding an interest-
ing, watery texture.
Stroking Your Image with Filters
You can find more stroking filters in the Brush Strokes submenu, with some interesting
texturizing filters that can spruce up less-than-perfect photos, and add a new look to even
your best shots. For example, Figure 2-5 was improved with the Accented Edges filter.
Choose Filter➪Brush Strokes to find the stroking filters that you’ll enjoy messing around with,
including

Ink Outlines: Adobe describes this filter as producing the look of a corroded ink


Spatter: This filter generates the look you might get from a sputtering airbrush.

Accented Edges: Use this filter to make a subject jump out from its background by
emphasizing the edges of all the objects in the picture, as I did with the photo of a
sleeping flamingo (see Figure 2-5).
I set the Edge Width to a narrow value of 2, but moved the Edge Brightness all the way
up to the maximum value of 50 so that the edges would seem to glow. I kept the
Smoothness slider at a minimum (3) so that the edges would be clearly delineated. Then,
I did a simple thing: I applied the filter twice to produce the soft, pastel look shown here.

Creating Exotic Edges for Your Images
An attractive border can give your image
an edge. If you want an edgy look or want
to take your work right to the edge, you
can apply this next technique faster than
you can say, “Overworked metaphor!”
Photoshop lets you apply deckled looks
and other effects to the borders of your
image by using any of several plug-ins built
right into your trusty Filters menu.
Follow these easy steps to the edge of
image immortality:
1.
Choose a photo that you think
could use a decorative border and
open it in Photoshop.
In these steps, I show you how to
apply an interesting edge using the
crouching tiger in this photograph.
b With the Rectangular Marquee tool,
select the object you’re framing.
3.
Double-click the Quick Mask mode
icon in the Tools palette, and make
sure that you have the Selected
Areas radio button selected in the
Color Indicates area.
d Click OK to enter Quick Mask mode.
Photoshop highlights the rectangle
you selected in color.
5.
Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur,
set the Radius, and click OK.
To give a softer edge when the
selection is deckled, I’ve set the
Radius to 20.
6.
Choose Filter➪Brush Strokes➪
Sprayed Strokes.
g Adjust the Stroke Length and Spray
Radius sliders to acquire the
desired effect.
In this case, I moved the sliders all
the way to the right. I needed the
maximum amount of stroking
because this picture is a high resolu-
tion, digital snapshot (2048 x 1536
pixels). If you’re working with a
photo with less detail, say 1024 x
768, move the slider only about two-
thirds of the way to the right.
h Choose Horizontal from the Stroke
Direction drop-down list.
You can also select Diagonal or
other directions to create different
effects.

Distorting for Fun
With one startling exception, Photoshop’s Distortion filters twist, turn, and bend your images
in surprising ways, turning ordinary objects into wavy images, pinched shapes, and bloated
spheres.
The single exception? The Diffuse Glow filter (which you access by choosing Filter➪Distort➪
Diffuse Glow) distorts images only to the extent that it imbues them with a soft, romantic,
fuzzy look that can make the sharpest image look positively ethereal.
I’ve never figured out why Adobe dumped this useful filter in the Distort submenu, but there it
is. (And here it is applied to a doll in Figure 2-6.)
Other filters of this ilk can produce wavy images, add pond ripples, pinch images, or trans-
form them into spheres. Check out Figure 2-7 to see distortions of a wall clock.
Choose Filter➪Distort➪Glass to play with the Glass filter, which can do the following to your
images:

Add a glass block texture

Add a canvas texture 

Create frosted-glass fuzziness

Break up your image with tiny lenses
Take a look at the image on the right in Figure 2-8, which is nothing more than the tiny
lenses variation of the Glass filter applied to an image of the data side of a CD-ROM.
Don’t like any of Photoshop’s textures? No biggie, you can also load your own texture. Click
the Texture pop-up menu (the right-pointing arrow) and choose Load Texture.

Pumping Up the Noise
Noise in images consists of any graininess or texture that occurs, either because of the inher-
ent quality of the image or through the editing process. Noise filters, like the Photoshop Add
Noise plug-in, produce random texture and grain in an image. If you’re new to image editing,
you might wonder why you’d want to add noise to an image in the first place. Wouldn’t it be
smarter to remove it? In practice, though, you’ll find lots of applications that call for a little
noise here and there:

To add texture: Objects that become too smooth, either because of blurring or other
image editing you may have done, often look better when you add some noise to give
them a texture. This technique is particularly useful if one object in an image has been
edited, smoothed, or blurred more than the other objects in the image.

To blend foreign objects into a scene: When you drop a new object into the middle of
an existing scene, you’ll often find that the amount of grain or noise in the new object is
quite different from the objects it’s joining.
For example, say you’ve decided to take a photo of your house and want to insert a cer-
tain luxury car in your driveway. Unfortunately, your digital photo of your brother-in-law’s
luxo-mobile is a lot sharper than the picture of your house. Adding a little noise can help
the two objects blend more realistically. You may even forget that the car isn’t yours.

To improve image quality: Images that contain smooth gradients often don’t print well
because many printers (especially older ones) are unable to reproduce the subtle blend
of colors from one hue to another. The result is objectionable banding in your printed
image: You can see distinct stripes as the colors progress from one to another in the top
image of Figure 2-9. Adding a little noise (as shown in the bottom image in Figure 2-9)
can break up the gradient enough that your printer can reproduce the blend of colors,
and the noise/grain itself is virtually invisible on the printed sheet.
Pumping Down the Noise
Although many Noise filters add grain, other filters in the Noise submenu don’t add noise at
all; instead, they make noise and artifacts like dust and scratches less noticeable. Choose
Filter➪Noise to find your tools, which include

Despeckle: This filter makes dust spots in your image less noticeable by decreasing the
contrast of your entire image — except at the edges. That translates into a slightly
blurry image (which masks the spots) that still retains sharpness in the edges of image
components. You end up with a little blur to soften the image, but enough detail in the
edges that the picture still looks good.
Figure 2-9

Making Your Own Background Textures
545

Dust & Scratches: This filter concentrates its blurring effect only on those areas of your
image that contain scratches and other artifacts, as shown in Figure 2-10. Photoshop
performs this magic by looking at each pixel in an image, moving out in a radial direc-
tion until it encounters an abrupt transition in tone. (That’s a signal that a spot or
scratch has been found.) You can specify the radius Photoshop searches for the little
culprits, from 1 to 16 pixels. Be careful not to overdo it. Too much of this filter can oblit-
erate the detail in the image.
While working with any of the Noise filters, it’s best to be very conservative at first. All the
Noise filters involve destruction of image data. A little bit can help and be just the effect
you’re looking for. Just a little bit more, however, may completely wreck things. 

Median: This filter reduces contrast around dust motes, thus hiding them, in a slightly
different way. This filter looks at the pixels surrounding each pixel in the image and
replaces the center one with a new pixel that has the median brightness level of that
group. The process is a little hard to describe succinctly, but basically, the bright spots
darken while the rest of the image isn’t affected.

Making Your Own Background Textures
Whether you need a background texture
for a portrait or to give your Web page a bit
of personality, Photoshop has all the tools
you need. While Photoshop features
dozens of different ways to create these
textures, here I show you a quick tech-
nique that employs the Noise filter. You’ll

noise can sometimes be a very good thing,
indeed.

In these steps, I show you how to create
the texture, make it fade into the back-
ground, and fill up a large Web page with a
small background image. You don’t need a
starter image; you can create this texture
from scratch.
a Choose File➪New and create a
new, empty RGB document.
In this exercise, I show you how to
create a fairly large background tex-
ture (400 x 400 pixels). For Web
pages, however, you can use much
smaller sizes (typically 128 x 128
pixels) because the background
repeats or tiles to fill the screen.
b Because you need an existing tone
in the image to noisify, choose
Edit➪Fill to access the Fill dialog
box, and then choose from the Use
drop-down list. Click OK to apply
the fill.
In this case, I’m choosing 50% gray.
c Choose Filter➪Noise➪Add Noise to
access the Add Noise dialog box,
where you’ll make some choices:
 Amount: I recommend choosing a
significant amount of pixel “dirt,”
roughly 60%.
 Distribution: Select the Gaussian
option to create an interesting
random pattern (rather than a
bland, uniform pattern).
 Monochromatic: Selecting this
option eliminates random color
specks.
Your image now looks a bit like one
of those “Magic Eye” graphics,
except you can squint all you like
and probably not see the image of
an elephant.

d To produce a 3-D texture, choose
Filter➪Stylize➪Emboss, and then
adjust the following settings:
 Angle: An Angle setting of 135
degrees gives the texture the
appearance that it’s being illumi-
nated from a light source coming
above and to the right of the tex-
ture. Using other angles produces
slightly different texture looks.
 Height and Amount: A Height set-
ting of 3 pixels and an Amount of
100% creates a moderate 3-D
look. Increasing these values
offers additional looks, but also

Click OK to apply the texture.
f To add a little color, choose Image➪
Adjustments➪Hue/Saturation, and
then adjust these settings:
 Colorize: Be sure to select this
check box.
 Hue: Move the Hue slider until
you find a color you like.
 Saturation: Use the Saturation
slider to create a light pastel ver-
sion of your chosen hue.
7.
Click OK to apply the color.
To enable a Web browser to repeat a
background texture over and over,
you need to make the edges blend
together. Some Photoshop filters
produce random patterns that auto-
matically tile. You have to offset
others, particularly those you create
from your own images, so that the
center portions become the edges.
h Choose Filter➪Other➪Offset, and
then enter values for Horizontal
and Vertical.
Type in a value that’s half the height
or width of your image. With this
400 x 400 pixel background, that
value is 200. If you’re making a 128 x
128 pixel background texture, use a
value of 64.

Breaking Your Image into Pieces
The Pixelate filters in Photoshop break up your images into bits and pieces, providing more of
those painterly effects you can get with brush strokes and artistic filters.
The Pixelate submenu (found at Filter➪Pixelate) includes the Crystallize filter applied to the
ancient castle wall shown in Figure 2-11, as well as plug-ins that produce color halftone
effects, fragmented images, and the Pointillism effect used in the “Creating Snow and Rain”
Putting-It-Together project later in this chapter.
Rendering
In computerese, rendering means creating something from nothing, in a way. That’s why ren-
dering filters in Photoshop all produce special effects by creating a look, object, or lighting
effect that’s melded with your original image.
Using the Clouds filter
The Clouds filter, for example, can muster a sky full of clouds from scratch with a few clicks of
the mouse, as in the now cloudy picture shown in Figure 2-12. This filter creates clouds using
random values from between the foreground and background colors. Indeed, most Photoshop
veterans use this filter so much that they have a surprising number of clouds in their images.
Find it at Filter➪Render➪Clouds. To create a more contrasty cloud effect, press Alt (Option on
the Mac) when choosing the command.

Need a quick Web background image? Create a 128 x 128 (or some multiple of that size)
pixel image and apply the cloud filter. It tiles seamlessly on your Web page.
Creating fibers
This new filter can create a textile-like effect out of the thin air. Choose Filter➪Render➪
Fibers. In the dialog box, move the Variance slider to increase the contrast between light and
dark areas. Move the Strength slider to increase the tightness of the weave of the fibers.
Click the Randomize button to get another variation of the effect of the filter.

Using other rendering filters
Other useful filters in the Render submenu (found at Filter➪Render) include

3D Transform: Use this filter to wrap objects around three-dimensional shapes such as
cubes and spheres, producing say, a mock-up of your favorite championship breakfast
cereal with your photo on the front.

Difference Clouds: Use this filter to create puffy objects in the sky (or foggy clouds at
lower levels). Instead of performing this magical feat the way the Cloud filter does, the
Difference Clouds filter uses image information to figure the difference in pixel values
between the new clouds and the image they’re joining. The result is a unique cloud
effect. Try applying the filter repeatedly to create a marbleized effect.

Lens Flare: This filter creates the reflection effect that plagues photographers when
they point their cameras toward a strong light source, such as the sun. Photoshop
mimics several different kinds of photographic lenses, giving you useful flares that can
spice up concert photos, add a sunset where none existed, and create other kinds of
lighting bursts. In the Lens Flare dialog box, specify a location for the center of the flare
by clicking on the image thumbnail or dragging the crosshair.

Lighting Effects: A sort of photo studio lighting setup, this filter uses pixels to do its
work. You can set up 16 different lights and manipulate how they illuminate your photo.

Texture Fill: This filter fills an area with a grayscale image. Select the filter and open the
image you want to use as the texture fill.

Creating Snow and Rain
Sometimes you may come across a photo
that needs a little bit of atmosphere thrown
in to give it extra punch. And I mean atmos-
phere literally. By using a couple of filters
and a blend mode, you can add some rain
or snow to any image. Just follow these
steps to create either rain or snow:
1.
Open a color image. It if isn’t cur-
rently in RGB Mode, then choose
Image➪Mode➪RGB Color.
You need to be in RGB mode
because the blend mode used in
these steps doesn’t work correctly
with CMYK images.
2.
Drag the background layer to the
Create a New Layer icon at the
bottom of the Layers palette.
You now see a layer that says
Background copy in the Layers
palette.
3.
Double-click the name Background
copy and type Snow.
This isn’t a mandatory step. I’m just
being ultra organized.
d With the Snow layer active, choose
Filter➪Pixelate➪Pointillize. In the
dialog box, set your cell size to 7 or
a value you prefer. Click OK.

The bigger the cell size, the bigger
the snowflakes or raindrops.
For rain, you might try a cell size of 3,
which is the minimum, or 4. For snow,
try a larger cell size, between 6 and 9.
I used a value of 7.
e On the Snow layer, choose Image➪
Adjustments➪Threshold. Move the
slider all the way to the right to a
max value of 255.
This adjustment takes the colored cells
and turns them to either black or white.
By using a value of 255, all bright-
ness values less than 255 turn black
and the remaining value turns white.
f On the Snow layer, choose Screen
from the Mode pop-up menu in the
Layers palette.
The Screen blend mode lightens the
Snow layer, where it mixes with the
Background underneath. Blending
with black pixels has no effect,
therefore they drop out.
g Choose Filter➪Blur➪Motion Blur.
In the dialog box, specify the Angle
and Distance values.
If you want it to appear that the wind is
blowing hard, set the angle more diag-
onally, around 45 degrees. If you want
it to appear that the weather is coming
straight down, set the angle to 90
degrees. Setting the distance elongates
the pointillized cells that you created in
Step 4, making them look a little more
realistic. For snow, start with a range of
about 8 to 12 pixels. For rain, start a
little higher, 15 to 25 pixels. I used a
value of 12 pixels.

The Unsharp Mask dialog box
appears.
9.
Specify the Amount, the Radius,

The Unsharp Mask filter gives the
illusion of sharpening the focus of
the image by increasing the contrast
between the pixels. (For more about
this filter, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)
I used an amount of 500%, a Radius
of 1, and kept the Threshold at 0.
This gives the raindrops a little
more definition.
j Choose Filter➪Blur➪Motion Blur.
In the dialog box, specify the Angle
and Distance values.
Again, the angle is up to you, but
make it consistent with the value
that you used in Step 7. Set the dis-
tance according to how you want
your rain to appear, a moderate
spring rain or a torrential, close-to-
hurricane type of downpour. I used
45 degrees and 25 pixels.

Getting Organic with the Sketch Filters
In true Adobe fashion, the Sketch filter submenu contains a few filters that don’t really belong
there. That’s because many of these filters were acquired from Aldus Corporation (now
defunct), and Adobe had to shoehorn them into the organizational structure of Photoshop.
But no matter, they work nonetheless.
If you were to encounter a picture of Rodin’s Thinker (upper-left image in Figure 2-13), you
might be tempted to sketch the famous sculpture by using one of the filters found by choosing
Filter➪Sketch.
Perhaps a Conté Crayon effect or a Graphic Pen and Ink look would be nice. But the Sketch sub-
menu also includes other artistic effects, such as the Note Paper look, a halftone screen, chalk
and charcoal, and even a bas relief effect that turns flat images into a Rodin-like sculpture.
You’ll also want to experiment with these other Sketch filters (again, find them at Filter➪
Sketch):

Chrome creates a polished chrome effect. Use the Levels adjustment to add more con-
trast if necessary.

Photocopy gives that infamous, anachronistic look (dating back from the days when
photocopiers didn’t do a very good job of reproducing halftone images). Creates areas
of black and white with little gray value.

Plaster creates a look that resembles molten plastic more than it looks like plaster. The
filter uses the foreground and background values to color the image.

Stamp mimics a rubber or wood stamp (not very sketch-like, indeed!).

Reticulation adds texture by reproducing a veritable photographic disaster: The wrin-
kling of film emulsion that occurs when you move film from one developing chemical to
another that has an extreme difference in temperature (think hot developer followed by
a bath in cold water!). The highlights look grainy while the shadow areas look thick and
goopy.

Torn Edges creates the look of ragged paper and colorizes the image, using the fore-
ground and background colors.

Water Paper creates the look of paint-like daubs on fibrous wet paper.
Even if the Sketch filters don’t all produce sketchy effects, they do have one thing in
common: They give your images an organic look that’s decidedly non-computerish.

Adding Water Droplets and Other Wet Effects
You’ll find lots of techniques for creating
nice, neat round drops of water by using
Photoshop. Unless you’ve just waxed your
car and expect a rain shower within
moments, however, perfectly beaded water
droplets can be fairly rare in real life.
Instead, you’re likely to encounter some
sloppy drops and driblets any time liquid
splashes onto a formerly dry surface.
This technique simulates that look. You
could use it to add sparkling water drops to
a flower, create a wet-look texture for artis-
tic effect, or add a three-dimensional trompe
l’oeil (“fools the eye”) optical illusion.
After you create water drops by using this
Putting-It-Together project, experiment with
different ways of applying them to images.
1.
Open a plain, old, dry-looking pho-
tograph in Photoshop.
I’m using a flower photograph,
which will look great wet.
2.
Press D to make sure you have the
foreground and background colors
in Photoshop set to the default
values of black and white.
c Choose Window➪Channels, click
the palette menu, and then choose
Create New Channel.
This creates a new alpha channel for
the water droplets. (For more on
channels, see Book VI.)

New Channel dialog box, select the

The bevel/embossing effect adds a

Adding Texture
Photoshop lets you add lots of interesting textures to your images, such as the cracked
canvas effect generated by the Craquelure filter (see Figure 2-14), or the pixel effect produced
by the Patchwork filter (see Figure 2-15). Find these filters at Filter➪Texture.

Book

Chapter

You’ll find other filters in this menu to help you create mosaic effects, add yet another kind of
film grain, and create stained-glass effects in your images.
Introducing the Texturizer
The most versatile filter in this set is the Texturizer. Choose Filter➪Texture➪Texturizer to
bring up the Texturizer dialog box, shown in Figure 2-16. The Texture filter enables you to
apply various kinds of textures to your images or selections, including Canvas, Sandstone,
Burlap, or Brick.
You can choose the relative size of the texture compared to the rest of your image by using
the Scaling slider, and govern the 3-D relief effect. You can even select the direction of the light
source that produces the 3-D look, choosing from top, bottom, either side, or any of the four
corners of the image. If those variations aren’t enough for you, create your own texture, save
it as a Photoshop PSD file, and use that to texturize your image.
You’ll find a handful of other filters that allow you to load your own (or someone else’s) tex-
tures, including Rough Pastels, Underpainting, and Conté Crayon.
Looking at the Other Filters
The Video and Other categories are where you might expect to find oddball filters that don’t fit
very well anywhere else. However, given that Adobe tends to sprinkle oddball filters anywhere
it likes anyway, it’s no surprise that the Other category is the home of the oddest of the odd.
Figure 2-16

Book VII  Chapter 2: Applying Filters for Special Occasions
564
For example, the Other submenu is home to the Custom filter, shown in Figure 2-17, which is
no filter at all but rather a dialog box with a matrix in which you can type numbers that
Photoshop uses to process the pixels in your image in unexpected ways.
The results will be surprising, especially if you don’t have a fairly intimate knowledge of how
Photoshop filters work.
The center box in the matrix represents a pixel in your image; the surrounding boxes repre-
sent the pixels that surround that pixel. The numbers you type tell Photoshop whether to
darken or lighten pixels. You can experiment to see what will happen, and if you like the
effect, tell all your friends that you meant to do that.
The High Pass filter, also found in the Other category, applies an effect opposite to the
Gaussian Blur filter. It finds and keeps the details in the edges where it finds distinct color or
tonal differences and turns the rest of the image gray. When converting a continuous-tone
image into a bitmap (black and white only) image, applying this filter is useful before applying
the Threshold adjustment. See Book VIII, Chapter 1 for more on the Threshold command. It is
also handy when creating a channel mask. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for details.
Two other filters that help in the masking arena are the Minimum and Maximum filters. The
Minimum filter expands the black areas while decreasing white areas (known as choking in tra-
ditional photography). The Maximum filter expands the white portions while decreasing black
areas (known as spreading). The radius value you enter tells the filter how many pixels to
expand or decrease from the edges of your selection.
The Video menu contains its own share of strange filters, including the NTSC Colors filter,
which performs the rather obscure function of converting all the colors in your image to
match the colors used for television reproduction. (NTSC stands for National Television
Systems Committee.) You’d use this filter to process digital presentations or slides to be
shown on television, if you were really, really particular about how the colors are portrayed.

Getting Rid of Video Scan Lines
Do you wish you had a “motor drive”
camera that could capture multiple still
images in rapid succession, letting you
analyze your golf stroke or provide a selec-
tion of images to choose from? While many
digital still cameras and some film cam-
eras have multishot modes, your video
camera can also do the job. All video cam-
eras capture the equivalent of 30 still
frames per second. All you need to do is
extract the individual pictures you want
with a video card in your computer that
includes a frame grabber. You can also
pause a video image on your television
and shoot a still picture with your camera
on a tripod or other sturdy support.
Unfortunately, you also probably capture a
set of dark horizontal lines known as video
scan lines. They’re produced as the televi-
sion or monitor display “paints” an image
on your screen line by line, one full screen
each  1⁄30 of a second.
Actually, that description is not quite true.
Most video displays provide an interlaced
picture, drawing odd-numbered lines in
one pass and even-numbered lines in a
second pass. Our eyes merge these two
interlaced images into one, and combine
successive frames to produce the illusion
of motion.
Photoshop allows you to take advantage of
the interlacing phenomenon to remove
those pesky scan lines. It can create a new,
line-free picture by ignoring either the
odd-numbered or even-numbered scan.
One set is often enough to create a smooth
image.
In the steps that follow, I use a Photoshop
De-Interlace filter to create such an image.
Just follow these easy steps:
1.
With a photograph in need of de-
interlacing open in Photoshop,
choose Filter➪Video➪De-Interlace.
b Select the Odd Fields button in the
Eliminate area of the De-Interlace
dialog box.
You can use either button in most
cases. The exception is when your
original image happens to already
be non-interlaced, as was the case
with older video monitors. You’ll
know when that happens — if you
choose the “wrong” field, you end up
with a totally black image because
that set of scan lines didn’t exist.
c Select the Interpolation button in
the Create New Fields area.
With interpolation, Photoshop looks
at the odd-numbered (or even-
numbered, if you chose that option)
scan lines on either side of a line
being processed, and creates a new
line of pixels that is an average of
the three lines examined. This usu-
ally produces better results and
smoother transitions than simply
duplicating each line.
4.
Click OK to apply the filter.
5.
You may have to adjust the bright-
ness and contrast of the photo to
produce the best image.
For some hints about adjusting
the brightness and contrast, see
Book VIII.

iquify is the only Photoshop filter that gets a chapter of its
own. But then again, Liquify is no ordinary filter; it’s the
ultimate in image distortion tools, and therefore a good
deal more complex than most of its kin on the Filter menu.
What other filter has its own hefty tools palette, loads of but-
tons, several different modes, and more than a dozen option
categories with what amounts to dozens more variations? And
what’s more, Adobe reorganized and enhanced it with even
more options in Photoshop CS.
The Liquify command lets you push and pull on parts of your
image; twist, turn, and pinch other parts; bloat sections; freeze
portions in place so that they remain immune to the transfor-
mations going around them; and perform selective reconstruc-
tions if you don’t like everything you’ve done. You can perform
this magic with a remarkable degree of control, too. Liquify
isn’t one of those “Oops! I meant to do that!” tools.
This chapter explores all the features of the Liquify command,
and shows you how to use them to create sensational images.
Exploring the Liquify Window
At first glance, the Liquify window is a little daunting. It’s a little
daunting on second, third, and fourth glances, too. However,
when you quit glancing and dive into this versatile filter, you’ll
find that the tools and options make a lot of sense.
The Liquify tools palette resides at the left side of the Liquify
window shown in Figure 3-1. The other options available with
Liquify (which I describe later in the section appropriately
named “The Options Areas”) appear at the right side of the

window. The tools palette includes a dozen tools that you can use to paint and distort your
image. Like Photoshop’s main Tools palette, you can activate each tool by pressing a letter
associated with its name. 
I hope you didn’t get too attached to the keyboard shortcut letters associated with the
Liquify tools in Photoshop 7, because most of them have changed.
The painting tools
The first group of tools is the group used to paint distortions on your image. Shown in this list
with their keyboard shortcuts in parentheses, the painting tools are (from top to bottom; see
Figure 3-1):

Warp (W): This tool is faintly reminiscent of the Smudge tool, but it doesn’t blur the
pixels quite as much as it pushes them forward as you drag, creating a stretched effect.
Use the Warp tool to push pixels where you want them to go, using short strokes or
long pushes. 
When compared to a tool like the Smudge tool, which tends to destroy detail, the Warp tool
can preserve detail within distortions.

Twirl Clockwise (C): Place the cursor in one spot, hold down the mouse button, and
watch the pixels under your brush rotate like a satellite photo of a tropical storm. Or
drag the cursor to create a moving twirl effect. Pixels move faster along the edges of the
brush than in the placid center, just like a real hurricane. Adobe gave the Twirl
Counterclockwise tool the pink slip. Now to twirl the other way, press the Alt (Option
on the Mac) key as you drag or hold down the mouse button.
Figure 3-1

Exploring the Liquify Window
569
Try this technique with the other tools I describe here (with some tools the effect is more
obvious than with others). Simply click and hold down the mouse button. The longer you
hold down the mouse button, the more prominent the effect becomes.

Pucker (S): This tool is the equivalent of the Pinch filter, squishing pixels toward the
center of the area covered by the brush as you hold down the mouse button or drag. To
reverse the pucker direction, which essentially applies a bloat, press the Alt (Option on
the Mac) key as you hold down the mouse button or drag.

Bloat (B): Here we have an analog to the Spherize filter, pushing pixels toward the edge
of the brush area as you hold down the mouse button or drag the mouse. To reverse the
bloat direction, which applies a pucker, press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key as you
hold down the mouse button or drag.

Push Left (O): Formerly known as the Shift Pixels tool, this odd tool moves pixels to the
left when you drag the tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag
clockwise to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag counterclockwise to
decrease the size. To reverse any of the directions, press the Alt (Option on the Mac)
key as you hold down the mouse button or drag.

Mirror (M): Formerly known as the Reflect tool, the Mirror tool drags a reversed image
of your pixels at a 90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) to force the reflection in the direction opposite the motion of
the brush (for example, to the left of a brush moving right, or above a brush moving
down). This tool is a good choice for producing shimmery reflections.

Turbulence (T): This tool adds a random jumbling effect to your pixels. You can use the
Turbulence tool to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, flames, and
waves.
You can see the effects of each of these tools in Figure 3-2.
The other tools
The remaining tools on the palette perform different functions. Continuing down the Liquify
tools palette (refer to Figure 3-1), these tools are (shown here with their keyboard shortcuts):

Reconstruct (R): This tool lets you completely or partially reverse or alter the distor-
tions you’ve made, letting you retrace your steps if you went overboard in your warping
activities.

Freeze Mask (F): Use this tool to protect areas from changes. It paints the frozen area
with a red overlay, just as the Quick Mask mode does (which, in a sense, the Freeze
Mask tool is, as you can find out later in this chapter in the section, “Mastering Freezing
and Thawing”).

Thaw Mask (D): This tool unprotects areas by erasing the red protective “freeze” tone.
This is a lot like erasing areas you’ve painted in Quick Mask mode.

Hand (H): The Hand tool works exactly like the standard Photoshop Hand tool. Click
and push the image to move it around within the preview window. You find more about
the Hand tool in Book I, Chapter 5.


Zoom (Z): The Zoom tool works exactly like the standard Photoshop Zoom tool. Indeed,
you can also zoom in and out by using the spacebar+Alt+click (spacebar+Option+click
on the Mac) and spacebar+Ctrl+click (spacebar+Ô+click on the Mac) shortcuts to zoom
in and out. See Book I, Chapter 5 for more on using the regulation Zoom tool.
Separate from the Liquify tools palette and in the lower-left corner of the Liquify window is a
magnification box with a pop-up menu that you can use to select magnifications from 6% to
1600%. You can also type in a specific value to zoom the image to that size.
In addition, Photoshop has now given you +/- zoom control buttons to let you click your way
to your desired magnification.
The Options Areas
At the right side of the Liquify window (refer to Figure 3-1) are some menus and buttons that
let you specify options for the tools, for reconstructing and freezing, and for viewing. I point
them all out to you now, and cover exactly how to use them later in this chapter.

Load Mesh and Save Mesh: Liquify lets you show or hide a criss-cross area called a
mesh, shown in Figure 3-3. The mesh provides a visual map of the distortions you’ve
applied. The mesh starts out as a checkerboard-like set of squares and changes as you
apply distortions. The mesh lets you clearly see exactly what you’ve done to the image,
and, even better, provides a way to save those distortions on your hard drive so that
you can load and reapply them to the same or a different image later.

Tool Options: You can use the Tool Options area to apply parameters to the painting
tools. You can specify the following options:
 Brush Size: Specifies the width of the brush. 
 Brush Density: Specifies how fast the brush effect levels off at its edges. For example,
with a feathered brush, the effect is stronger in the center and lighter at the edges.
 Brush Pressure: Specifies the speed at which you distort as you drag. Lower is slower.
 Brush Rate: Specifies the speed at which you distort as you keep a tool stationary,
such as the Twirl tool. Again, lower is slower.
 Turbulent Jitter: Determines how tightly the brush jumbles pixels. This option gives
the stroke a more natural, organic look.
When you select the Reconstruct tool, you can also choose a Reconstruct Mode from
the pop-up menu. I explain each of these modes later in the chapter.
If you have a pressure-sensitive stylus tablet, you can also choose to use the amount of
pressure you apply to control the width of your brush stroke.

Reconstruct Options: Here, you can select one of several reconstruct modes (again, to
be described shortly). There are also Reconstruct and Restore All buttons that let you

reverse all changes made on unfrozen areas (a little at a time) or revert to your last set
of distortions. I show you how to use these, too.

Mask Options: Adobe really beefed up this set of options formerly known as the Freeze
area. Consider freezing and masking one and the same when you’re immersed in the
Liquify dialog box. The mask options let you freeze areas from existing selections, layer
masks, transparent areas, or alpha channels in your image. You can also invert the
frozen area (thawing frozen portions of the image, and freezing the areas that were pre-
viously thawed), and thaw all the areas that were frozen with one click. Here is the low-
down on each option, which is indicated by a double-circle icon:
 Replace selection: Allows you to freeze or mask areas of your image based on an
existing selection, transparent areas, a layer mask, or an alpha channel. For more on
layer masks and alpha channels, see Book VI, Chapters 1 and 3.
 Add to selection: Displays the mask in the image and then enables you to add to the
frozen areas with the Freeze tool. Adds pixels to the currently frozen areas.
 Subtract from selection: Subtracts pixels from the currently frozen areas.
 Intersect with selection: Masks only those pixels that are selected and currently
frozen.
 Invert selection: Inverts selected pixels and currently frozen areas.
Click None to remove frozen areas. Click Mask All to freeze the entire image. Click Invert
All to exchange frozen and thawed areas.

View Options: You can show or hide frozen (masked) areas, the mesh, or the image. I
show you why you’d want to do each of these shortly. Also, if you choose the Show Mesh
option, you can choose the mesh size and color. If you select the Show Mask option, you
can select the color that indicates frozen areas. For example, if your image contains lots
of red, you may want to change the freeze color to blue to create more contrast. 
Finally, you can also apply a backdrop that makes seeing how the image being liquefied will
appear when merged with other layers. To view your distorted image along with other layers,
select the Show Backdrop option, and then select the particular layer you want to view, or
choose All Layers from the Use pop-up menu. You can now choose whether you want the back-
drop in front of, behind, or blended with the distorted image. Specify an opacity percentage for
the displayed layers so that they won’t obliterate the image being distorted. The default of 50
percent allows you to see both well, allowing you to keep track of your distortions.

Transforming an Image
Liquify seems impossibly complex on the surface, but it’s as easy to apply as fingerpaint after
you play with it a little. Here’s a step-by-step scenario of the things you might do to apply
some distortion to your own image:
1.
Select and open an image you want to
transmogrify with Liquify. Select a
layer.
2.
If you don’t want to distort the whole
layer, you can make your desired
selection. 

Transforming an Image
573
Book
VII
Chapter
3
Remember that you can also use a
layer mask, an alpha channel, or trans-
parent areas to define what portions
you want to distort.
3.
Choose Filter➪Liquify or press
Shift+Ctrl+X (Shift+Ô+X on the Mac).
The Liquify dialog box appears.
d If applicable, load your selection,
layer mask, transparent areas, or
alpha channel in the Mask Options
area (see the earlier explanation of
the mask options).
Make sure that you have selected the
Show Mask option in the View Options
area. 
e You can also select the Freeze Mask
tool and paint over the areas that you
want to mask or protect.
After you’ve frozen an area, you may
want to get rid of the freeze highlight-
ing for a while. Deselect the Show Mask
option in View Options to turn the dis-
play on or off.
f In the View Options area, make sure
that the Show Mesh and Show Image
options are both selected.
You can hide any or all of these at any
time to get a different view of your image.
For example, you might want to hide the
frozen areas and mesh to view only your
image with the distortions you’ve applied
so far. Or, perhaps, you might want to look
only at the mesh, as shown in Figure 3-4,
to get a stylized look at the distortions by
themselves. The ability to see the liquifica-
tion process in several different ways is one
of the reasons why Liquify is so controllable.

At various points while you work, you
may decide that you want to freeze
parts of the image from further changes
(either temporarily or permanently).
i If you decide you want to work on an

again (if necessary). Then select the
Thaw Mask tool and erase all or part
of the freeze.
10.
Use the Reconstruct tool or options to
partially or fully reverse or modify
your distortions.
If you want to start over, click Restore
All to get back to your original image.
All option settings will stay as is. Press
the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and
click Reset to revert back to your origi-
nal image and reset all options to their
default settings.
k When you’re finished, save the mesh
you created by clicking Save Mesh.
Give the mesh a name and store it on
your hard drive.
This step is totally optional, but it’s a
good idea if you really like what you’ve
done.

Apply the distortion to your image by
clicking OK and exiting the Liquify
dialog box.

Mastering Freezing and Thawing
575
Mastering Freezing and Thawing
Liquify’s ability to protect areas by freezing, and unprotect areas by thawing, deserves a
closer look. Consider freezing the equivalent to masking. Here’s a summary of the things you
need to know:

The easiest way to freeze/unfreeze is to use the Freeze Mask and Thaw Mask tools to
paint the areas you want to protect or unprotect, as shown in Figure 3-6. Use the
brush controls to modify how either tool paints or erases. When you set brush pressure
to less than 100%, the opacity of the mask you’re painting determines how frozen that
area is. For example, if an area is only 25% frozen, using a tool on that area will produce
only one-quarter the distortion you’ll get in an area that’s completely thawed.

You can use active or saved selections to define a frozen or masked area. This is a
great capability; you can use all the selection tools in Photoshop to define frozen/
unfrozen areas before you invoke Liquify. You could, for example, select a portion of
your image by using the Magic Wand tool, another portion using selection marquees or
Quick Mask mode, and then save them all (choose Selection➪Save Selection) as alpha
channels. Then, when you use Liquify, choose any of those selections to freeze an area.

Choose the basis to use for your mask from the pop-up menu of the Replace Selection
command.
You can also choose a layer mask to define your mask. This is a great way to apply your dis-
tortions at varying degrees of intensity. Where the mask reveals more, the distortion is more
prominent. Where the mask hides more, the distortion is more subtle.


To reverse your frozen/unfrozen areas, click the Invert All button. That which was
frozen will be thawed, and that which was unfrozen will be frozen. Amen!
Reconstructing an Image
One of the most powerful capabilities of Liquify is the ability to fully or partially reconstruct
your image, restoring some or all of it to its pre-Liquify state. This ability gives you a great
deal of control over exactly how Photoshop transforms your image because you can backtrack
any particular part of the transformation exactly as you want to. Here are some of your options:

To cancel all the changes made on your image (say, you really, really messed up),
click the Restore All button in the Reconstruct Options area. The image returns to its
original state when you first opened the Liquify window and removes distortions in
both frozen and unfrozen areas.

To change only unfrozen areas of your image to their original states, select the Revert
mode in the Reconstruct Options area of the dialog box, and then click the Reconstruct
button. The frozen areas remain distorted, but everything else returns to normal.
Use this option when you’re displeased with some sections but like the distortions in others.
Freeze the stuff you like, and let Liquify cancel the changes elsewhere.

To paint portions of your image back to normalcy, choose Revert mode in the Tool
Options area, and then select the Reconstruct tool from the Liquify tools palette. You
can use the Reconstruct tool to restore the areas that you paint. The image reverts
more quickly at the center of the brush, so you have an extremely fine degree of control
in how you revert your image. The mesh may help you see exactly what portions are
being restored, too.

You can also click the Reconstruct button to have Photoshop apply an overall recon-
struction. Click the button and Photoshop reconstructs once. Click again to remove
even more distortion.
If you don’t necessarily want to reconstruct your image back to its original condition,
but rather alter, extend, or clone your distortions, you can choose Reconstruct modes
other than Revert. See the next section on the other Reconstruct modes.
Extending and Cloning Distortions
Liquify allows you to extend distortions you’ve made in frozen areas into parts of the image
that are unfrozen. If you have an image that has the requisite frozen and unfrozen portions,
you should first choose a mode, which determines how Photoshop extends the image from
the frozen areas into the unfrozen area.

Extending and Cloning Distortions
577
Reconstruct modes
The modes include the following four:

Rigid: This mode keeps rigid (natch) right angles in the mesh’s grid, which can generate
some mismatches (Adobe calls them discontinuities) at the edges where the frozen and
unfrozen portions meet. This mode restores unfrozen areas pretty closely to their origi-
nal states.

Stiff: Adobe describes this as a weak magnetic field, attracting the edges between the
frozen and unfrozen areas strongly where they meet, and producing less distortion the
farther away from the edges the unfrozen areas are.

Smooth: This mode smoothly spreads the frozen areas’ distortions through the
unfrozen areas. It produces a smooth blending effect.

Loose: This mode generates an even smoother blending effect between the frozen and
unfrozen areas.
Use the Reconstruct tool to expand the frozen-area distortions into the unfrozen area, using
the mode you’ve selected to blend the pixels as you paint. You can drag to paint, or click and
Shift+click to paint in straight lines (much as you do with Photoshop’s regular Brush tools).
More Reconstruction modes
There are three more reconstruction modes that work slightly differently from the previous
four. These modes more or less clone distortions you’ve already applied elsewhere in the
image. Like the Clone Stamp tool, these modes allow you to select part of the distortion and
apply (or clone) copies of the selection to other parts of your image:

Displace: Displace copies the amount of displacement at the starting point of the distor-
tion to unfrozen parts of your image. You can use this mode to displace parts of your
image to a different position in the image.

Amplitwist: Amplitwist applies the displacement, scaling (sizing up or down), and rota-
tion of the distortion to unfrozen areas to match those that exist at the starting point.

Affine: Affine does much the same thing as Amplitwist, using displacement, scaling,
rotation, and skew in the distortion to modify unfrozen areas to match those distortions
that exist at the starting point.
Each time you click the mouse button, you create a new starting point, so if you are trying to
extend a distortion effect from a single starting point, don’t release your mouse button until
you are done using the Reconstruct tool.

Using Displace, Amplitwist, and Affine
All three of these Reconstruct modes use a different combination of distortion factors, such as
displacement, scaling, rotation, or skew. Unlike the modes listed previously, the Reconstruct
button isn’t available for these three. Note that you can use these modes only with the
Reconstruct tool itself.
To use Displace, Amplitwist, or Affine, follow these steps:
1.
Open an image to work on, and
choose Filter➪Liquify.
b Choose one of the three modes —
Displace, Amplitwist, or Affine —
from the Reconstruct Mode pop-up
menu in the Tool Options area.
c Choose the Reconstruct tool.
4.
Click somewhere in the image
where you want to clone the applied
distortion.
5.
Drag with the mouse in the unfrozen
areas to apply that distortion.
6.
To change the origin of the distor-
tions being copied, click again any-
where in a distorted area to choose
a new sampling point. Then resume
dragging in unfrozen areas. 
Your image takes on a distorted
appearance, like the one shown in
Figure 3-7.

When you’re finished, click OK to
apply the distortion.

Book VIII
Retouching and
Restoration


P
hotoshop can provide magical transformations to images,
making them unrecognizable from the original, but some-
times what you really want is simply to make an image look
the same as the original — only better. Perhaps the colors are a
little too warm, or the shadows a bit inky. Whatever’s wrong with
the image, the last thing you want is to change it so much that it
looks like it’s been processed more than a freeze-dried floral
arrangement. You’d be happy to have everyone admire your
image without a clue that you’d made major corrections in
Photoshop.
Welcome to the world of image enhancements. This chapter
concentrates on the things you can do to correct color, con-
trast, hue, and color saturation. After you master the basic
tools, you’ll want to explore some even more sophisticated
things you can do by using features like Photoshop’s
Adjustment Layers (in Book V, Chapter 1), which let you
dynamically apply your changes in remarkably flexible ways.
But before you dive into image adjustments, you’ll want to
make sure and remove any flaws, such as dust, scratches,
blemishes, and other nasty items, from your image. Check out
Book VIII, Chapter 3, to find out about fixing imperfections.
Introducing the Histogram Palette
One of the first things you want to do before you make
any color or tonal adjustments to your image is to take a
good look at the quality and distribution of the tones
throughout your image. I don’t mean just eyeballing the
composite image on your screen. I’m talking about getting
inside your image and looking at its guts. This just got
easier with the introduction of the Histogram palette. Sure.
You could access the histogram of a image through dialog
boxes such as the Levels command, but now you’ve been
given the histogram in a palette that can stay on-screen,
giving you constant feedback on your image adjustments.

A histogram displays the tonal range (also referred to as the key type) of an image, as shown
in Figure 1-1. It shows how the pixels are distributed by graphing the number of pixels at each
of the 256 brightness levels in an image. On this graph, pixels with the same brightness level
are stacked in bars along a vertical axis. The higher the line from this axis, the greater the
number of pixels at that brightness level. You can view the distribution for each color channel
separately or for the composite image as a whole. From this graph, you can then determine
whether the image contains enough detail in the shadow, midtone, and highlight areas. This
information helps you determine what image adjustments you may need to make. For exam-
ple, an image with good tonal range displays pixels in all areas. An image with poor tonal
range has gaps in the histogram, as shown in Figure 1-2.

Introducing the Histogram Palette
583
Using the Histogram palette 
Choose Window➪Histogram to bring up this graphical wonder. By default, the histogram dis-
plays the tonal range of the whole image. However, you can also make a selection to view the
tones of just that portion. Or you can even select a single channel to view the tones of that
individual channel.
When you first bring up the Histogram palette, it opens in Compact View by default. No con-
trols or statistics are visible. To access the various views, go to the Histogram palette pop-up
menu. Here is a description of each view:

Compact View: Displays only a histogram of the whole image (or your chosen selection
or channel) with no controls or statistics.

Expanded View: Shows a histogram with statistics and controls for choosing and viewing
the histogram of individual channels. There are also controls for refreshing the histogram
to show uncached data, and choosing a selected layer (on the Source pop-up menu).
Refer to Figure 1-1 to see this view.

All Channels View: Displays all the options of the Expanded View, plus shows the indi-
vidual histograms for each color channel. Note that the individual histograms don’t
include alpha channels, spot channels, or masks. Refer to Figure 1-3 to see this view.

Here is a laundry list of other facts about using the Histogram palette:

The default display option of the histogram is the composite image’s color mode, such
as RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, and so on.

If you are in Expanded or All Channels View, you can choose to display the histogram of
an individual channel. The palette also displays alpha channels and spot channel. 

Other options on the Channel pop-up menu include Luminosity and Colors. Luminosity
displays a histogram which shows the luminance (or lightness component) of the
image. Colors displays a composite histogram of each color channel in color. Note that
Photoshop retains and displays the option you choose on the Channel pop-up menu —
even if you switch views.

To view your channels in color, choose Show Channels in Color from the palette pop-up
menu. If you want to see the channel in color in Compact View, first choose the channel
in Expanded or All Channels View, choose Show Channels in Color, and then switch to
Compact View.

To hide the statistics in the Expanded and All Channels views, deselect Show Statistics
from the Histogram palette pop-up menu. 

Position your cursor within the histogram to see statistics about a specific value. Drag
your cursor within the histogram to see statistics about a range of values (Photoshop
highlights the range). 

By default the histogram displays the values of your entire image, which includes all
layers.

To display the histogram of a single layer, choose Selected Layer from the Source pop-
up menu. Photoshop displays the histogram of the layer that’s currently selected in the
Layers palette. If the image doesn’t have layers, the option isn’t available.

To show the histogram of an adjustment layer, select Adjustment Composite from the
Source pop-up menu. Photoshop displays the histogram of the adjustment layer that’s
currently selected in the Layers palette (and all the layers below that adjustment layer).
For more on adjustment layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.

Be sure to select any Preview options in the dialog boxes of your image adjustments,
such as Levels. That way, the Histogram palette displays both the original and adjusted
histograms, as seen in Figure 1-4. 

The Cached Data Warning icon, shown in Figure 1-3, lets you know that Photoshop is
reading the histogram from cache instead of your image’s current state. Cache is a
reserved, high-speed section of your computer’s memory. The image cache allows the
histogram to display faster because it is calculating the histogram based on a represen-
tative sampling of the pixels in your image. If you want to refresh the histogram to dis-
play all the pixels in your image in its current state, click the Uncached Refresh button,
also shown in Figure 1-3. You can also choose this command from the palette pop-up
menu. Or simply double-click anywhere in the histogram. Unless it is really bogging
down your workflow, I recommend viewing your image’s histograms using uncached
data.

Introducing the Histogram Palette
585
Select the Use Cache for Histograms option in the Memory and Image Cache panel of your
Preferences if you wish to utilize cached image data in your histogram.
Understanding the histogram statistics
The Histogram palette gives you all kinds of statistics about the pixels in your image. Some of
these statistics, such as Standard Deviation, may be for those who live in the land of Calculus.
But you may be able to glean some useful information from some of the other statistics that
can help you in your image-adjusting tasks. Here’s a brief explanation of each statistic:

Mean: Average intensity value 

Standard Deviation: How much the intensity values vary 

Median: Middle value of the intensity value range 

Pixels: Total number of pixels used to represent the histogram

Cache Level: The current level of image cache used to calculate the histogram 
As mentioned in the preceding section, when the histogram is calculated using image cache
it is basing it on a sampling of the pixels in your image. The original image is cache level 1.
For every level above that, Photoshop averages four adjacent pixels below to get one pixel,
so each level is half the dimensions (1⁄4 the number of pixels) of the level below. When you
choose the Uncached Refresh command, the cache level reverts to 1.
The next three statistics display a value only when you position or drag your cursor in the
histogram. Each value corresponds only to the portion of the histogram under your cursor.

Level: Intensity level 

Count: The total number of pixels corresponding to that intensity level 

Percentile: The number of cumulative pixels (in percentages) at or below that level,
from 0% (left) to 100% (right)

Choosing Automatic Color Correctors
Photoshop has three automatic correction tools that can, in many cases, provide an improved
appearance with a simple click of a menu command. However, none of the automatic controls
is likely to do as good a job as you can do manually, and sometimes automatic controls even
do more harm than good. If you have an average image (one that doesn’t require a great deal
of correction), you can try them out to see if they help. If not, you’ll want to apply the manual
tools explained later in this chapter to produce the exact look you want.
Here’s an introduction to the three tools:

Auto Levels: Adjusts the highlights (brightest portions of an image that contain detail)
and shadows (the darkest portions of an image that contain detail).

Auto Color: Adjusts the color balance of an image.

Auto Contrast: Controls the relationship between the balance of bright and dark tones.
You don’t need to know much about levels, color balance, or contrast to use the automatic
correctors (that’s why they’re automatic), but you find out more about each of them later in
this chapter when I show you how to take over the controls and make adjustments manually.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command uses a bit of built-in Photoshop intelligence to automatically apply
the Levels command (discussed later in the chapter) to your image.
Auto Levels works best with average images that could use a bit of tweaking but have lots of
detail in the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones.
Auto Levels defines the very lightest and darkest pixels of each of the three colors as white
and black, respectively, and then arranges the mid-tone pixels in between. Along the way, as
it balances the tones in your image, the command may reduce color casts or even introduce
some. You can fine-tune the color manually after Auto Levels has done its work, using the
tools described later.
To try out the Auto Levels command, just choose Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Levels, or press
Shift+Ctrl+L (Shift+Ô+L on the Mac).
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an unwanted color
cast. If this happens, cancel the command and try the Auto Contrast command. If that still
doesn’t improve it, try the Levels command instead.
Auto Color
The Auto Color command adjusts both the color and contrast of an image, based on the shad-
ows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the image. You usually use the command to remove a
color cast (or bias) or balance the color in your image. Sometimes using Auto Color can be
helpful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated colors as well. You can access the com-
mand by choosing Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Color, or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+B (Shift+Ô+B
on the Mac).

Setting Auto Color Correction Options
587
Although Auto Color can do a good job on its own, you can customize the parameters it uses
to make its color corrections in the Auto Color Corrections Options dialog box, which I dis-
cuss in “Setting Auto Color Correction Options,” next in this chapter. Check out Color Plate 8-1
to see an image corrected using Auto Levels and Auto Color.
Auto Contrast
Like its manually operated cousin, the Brightness/Contrast command, the Auto Contrast com-
mand fiddles with the overall contrast and colors (if you’re working with a color image) in an
image, rather than making adjustments to each color individually. Auto Contrast converts the
lightest and darkest pixels to white and black, respectively, making all highlights in the image
lighter and all shadows darker without changing the color values. This command may not do
as good a job at improving contrast, but it retains the color balance of an image and doesn’t
cause any nasty color casts. Try using this command on hazy images.
To use Auto Contrast, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Contrast, or press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+L
(Option+Shift+Ô+L on the Mac).
Setting Auto Color Correction Options
The options available in the Auto Color Correction dialog box are on the advanced side, and
this set of tools is best used if you already understand manual color and contrast corrections.
You’ll want to brush up on your color theory, too, in Book II, Chapter 3.
You can use the Auto Color Correction Options dialog box to tweak exactly how Photoshop
applies its Auto Levels, Auto Color, and Auto Contrast controls, as well as for the manually
operated Levels and Curves commands.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Understanding your Auto Correction options
Photoshop uses algorithms to make adjustments to images. When you use the Auto Correction
Options dialog box, you have to decide which algorithms to use. Here are your options:

Enhance Monochromatic Contrast: This option applies the same changes to the red,
green, and blue channels, making brighter areas appear lighter, and shadow areas
appear darker, with no changes made to the colors. (This is the method used by the
Auto Contrast command.)

Enhance Per Channel Contrast: This option individually adjusts the red, green, and
blue colors so that each has its own best balance of light and dark tones, even if the
color balance changes a bit. (This is the algorithm used by the Auto Levels command.)

Find Dark & Light Colors: This option locates the average lightest and darkest pixels,
and uses their values to maximize the contrast of the image. (This is the algorithm used
by the Auto Color command.)

When you understand these commands, feel free to customize the automatic options, follow-

the settings as defaults for all your Photoshop work.
1.
Open an image and choose Image➪
Adjustments➪Levels or Ctrl+L (or

You can also use the Curves command
by pressing Ctrl+M (or Ô+M on the
Mac).
2.

See Figure 1-5.
c In the algorithm area, click the

adjust the tones. Your choices include
 Enhance Monochromatic Contrast
 Enhance Per Channel Contrast 
 Find Dark & Light Colors
d Click to add a check mark in the Snap
Neutral Midtones if you want
Photoshop to base its gamma correc-
tion values around a neutral color
located in the image.
The Auto Color command uses this
option. You can find more about
gamma correction in Appendix A.
e In the Target Colors & Clipping area,
enter a value in each of the clip text
entry boxes.
Setting clipping values between 0.5 and
1% eliminates the too-dark and too-light
pixels.
These values adjust the amount of
black and white pixels that Photoshop
removes from the darkest and lightest
areas of the image.
This option is useful because every
image includes some very dark pixels
that contain no real image information,
as well as some very light pixels that
are completely washed out.
Factoring in these two kinds of pixels
when you adjust tonal values is a
waste.

Using Simple Color Correctors
Photoshop has several simple manual tools you can use to fix color in ways that are different
from the Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, and Auto Color commands. They are the Brightness/
Contrast control, Color Balance, Desaturate command, and the ever-popular Variations tool.
You should learn when to use (and when not to use) each of them, as described in the fol-
lowing sections.
Avoiding Brightness/Contrast
Beginners gravitate to the Brightness/Contrast control because it seems so simple to use. If
your image is too dark, move a slider to make it lighter; if it’s too light, move the same slider
to make it darker. Right? You can fix an image that’s overly contrasty or overly flat-looking the
same way. Right? 
Nope.
In practice, the Brightness/Contrast control is a bad choice for making an image darker or
lighter, and for adding or reducing contrast. Its chief failing is that it applies all its changes
equally to all areas of your image. For example, you may have a photo that has some shadows
that need brightening up but all the middle tones and highlights are just fine. The Brightness
slider doesn’t take that into account. 
Move the slider to the right, and, sure enough, your shadows become brighter. But so do your
midtones and highlights, which you probably don’t want. (See Figure 1-6.) 
The impulse is to try to fix the bright spots you create with the Brightness slider by fiddling
with the Contrast slider. Before you know it, your image is a mess. Be careful.
Although some kinds of pictures you can help a little with the Brightness/Contrast control,
you’re better off using Levels and Curves, which can tailor your image enhancements to the
exact portions of the image you want to work with.

Tweaking with the Color Balance controls
If you remember your color theory (review it in Book II, Chapter 3, if you like), you can proba-
bly use the Color Balance controls to make some simple changes to the color in your image.
The difficult part is in recognizing exactly which color you need to add or subtract from your
image in the first place.
Colors are subtler than you might think. For example, a slight color cast toward cyan can look
a lot like a slightly green or blue color cast. Is your image too red, or does it have too much
magenta?
Use the Variations command, described in the following section, to figure out how to tell the
various color casts apart. Variations displays each of the different types of color casts in an
array so you can compare them.
To use the Color Balance controls, follow these steps:
Figure 1-6

Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Color Balance, or press Ctrl+B
(Ô+B on the Mac) to access the
Color Balance dialog box.
b Choose the Shadows, Midtones, or
Highlights option to select the tones
of an image you want to work on.

Usually, Midtones is the best choice,
unless your image has a color cast in
the shadows or highlights that doesn’t
affect the overall image.
That can sometimes happen when a
subject is close to a colored wall or
other object that reflects light onto,
say, the shadowed side of a subject.
3.
Make sure you have selected the
Preserve Luminosity option. 
That way, Photoshop modifies the
colors of the image, but the brightness
and contrast of the tones stay the same.
d Move the Cyan/Red, Magenta/Green,
or Yellow/Blue sliders to add or
subtract color, watching the effects of
your adjustments on the original
image.
The Color Levels boxes show the
amount of each color that Photoshop
adds and subtracts. For example,
Figure 1-7 shows a value of –22, indicat-
ing that Photoshop subtracted red
from the image.
The colors are arranged by their oppo-
sites on the color wheel. Dragging the
slider toward Cyan adds cyan to the
image and subtracts its complement,
red. Dragging toward Green adds green
to the image and subtracts magenta.
If you’re like me, you like clicking options, adjust-
ing values, and sliding sliders back and forth.
Thankfully, Photoshop is happy to oblige you
with options to make you feel so powerful that
you can take on any project. 
Was that a sinister laugh I heard? Easy there, part-
ner. I’m about to tell you something that will break
your heart at first, but which you’ll thank me for
later: Always pick a single slider and stick with it
when you’re trying to compensate for any color
cast. Moving two sliders is a waste because you
can accomplish anything you want with just one. 
For example, if you move both the Cyan/Red and
Magenta/Green sliders an equal amount to the
left (adding cyan and magenta), you’re actually just
adding blue. Moving three sliders is even worse
because, depending on the amount and direction
of movement, the three are likely to at least par-
tially cancel each other out or multiply the effects.
However, if a cast is just in one area, such as the
shadows, and a different color cast in another area,
it may be useful to do more than one adjustment.

Fixing Exposure with Shadow/Highlight
The new Shadow/Highlight adjustment is a great new feature that offers a quick and easy
method of correcting the lighting in your photos. It allows you to correct over- and under-
exposed areas in your image. This command works well with subjects photographed with
the light source coming from behind (backlit) and consequently have a dark foreground. The
new adjustment is also helpful for bringing out the detail in harsh shadow areas in subjects
shot in bright, overhead light, as shown in Figure 1-8. This command doesn’t really correct
overall exposure. Instead, it lightens or darkens pixels according to the luminance (bright-
ness) of the surrounding pixels, technically called a local neighborhood. 
The Shadow/Highlight command also has a Midtone Contrast slider, Black Clip, and White Clip
options for adjusting the overall contrast of the image. 
Follow these steps to get familiar with this new addition to the adjustment arsenal:

change, make sure you have selected
the Preview check box. The default set-
tings found in the dialog box are meant
to correct backlit images, so they may
or may not do the right correction job
for you as they are set.

Shadows and/or your Highlights.

The higher the percentage, the lighter
the shadows and the darker the high-
lights. You can also enter a value in the
percentage text box.
c If you’re happy with the results, you
can click OK and be done with the
adjustment. However, if you crave
more control, click the Show More
Options check box at the bottom of
the dialog box.
A whole array of sliders magically
appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
d Drag the Tonal Width slider to
increase or decrease the range of
tones adjusted in the shadows or
highlights.
The lower the percentage, the narrower
the range of tones that will be affected.
For example, by using a very low per-
centage, only the darkest parts of the
shadow or the lightest parts of the
highlight are corrected. Similarly, by
using a high percentage, you include a
wide range of tones, including midtone
areas. The appropriate percentage to
use varies among images, so start with
the default setting of 50% and work in
small increments from there. 
If, when lightening the shadow areas,
you find the midtones and highlights
getting too light as well, reduce the
Tonal Width percentage of the Shadows.
But if you start seeing artifacts, you
have set the percentage too high.
e Drag the Radius slider to increase or
decrease the number of pixels used in
the local neighborhood.
Remember that this command uses the
luminance of surrounding pixels, called
local neighborhood, for adjusting the
shadows and highlights. The best local
neighborhood size depends on the par-
ticular image, so play with this slider
and view the results. If the Radius is
too small, your main subject may lack
contrast. Conversely, if it’s too large,
your background may be overly bright
or dark. Adobe recommends setting
the radius to approximately half the
size of the main subject in your image.
So if your subject takes up roughly 600
pixels, then set your radius to 300
pixels. Choose Show Rulers on the
View menu and set your Units to pixels
in your Preferences. 
f Make additional changes in the
Adjustments area as needed: 
 Color Correction: Available for color
images only, this control enables you
to correct the colors in only the
adjusted portions of your image.
Often when you increase or decrease
the Amount of Shadows or Highlights,
you bring out the “hidden” colors.
Generally, higher Color Correction
values make colors more saturated,
whereas lower values make colors
more desaturated. 
 Brightness: Available for grayscale
images only, this command adjusts
the brightness. Move the slider left
to darken and right to lighten. 
 Midtone Contrast: This control
adjusts the contrast in the midtone
areas. Move the slider left to reduce
contrast and right to increase con-
trast. Just be aware that when you
increase the Midtone Contrast, you
may also undesirably darken shadow
areas and lighten highlight areas.
 Black Clip/White Clip: These values
specify how much of the shadows
(black) and highlights (white) are
clipped to the new shadow (level 0)
and highlight (level 255) colors in the
image. Clipping causes the remaining
levels to be redistributed between
the brightness levels of 0 and 255.
Higher percentages increase the
tonal range and therefore create
greater contrast, but when the value
is too high it causes lack of detail in
the shadows and highlights.

Correcting Color Cast with Variations
Photoshop’s Variations feature is a variation (so to speak) on the professional photographer’s
ring around (a set of color prints, each made with slightly different color balance) or test strip
(a single print of an image made so that each section is shown using a different color bal-
ance). Both tools let you view several renditions of an image and choose the best one visually
by comparing them. You might want to use Variations when you’re unsure about exactly how
the color is biased, and you want to compare several versions of an image to see exactly what
the color cast is.

Although not as sophisticated as some color correction techniques, the Variations feature has
the advantage of being quick and simple, and it doesn’t require a lot of training to use. Color
Plate 8-2 in the color insert shows an example of an image that was greatly improved by using
the Variations adjustment.
Here are the components of the Variations dialog box (shown in the Putting-It-Together proj-
ect that follows):

In the upper-left corner is a pair of images — the original image and the image as it
appears when Photoshop applies the corrections.

Below these thumbnails is a set of six variations on the original image, each with a fixed
amount of correction applied using (clockwise from upper-left) green, yellow, red,
magenta, blue, and cyan. In the center of this ring is the current version of the image. As
you apply adjustments, the Current Pick thumbnail updates accordingly.

At the right edge of the dialog box is a stack of three thumbnails showing a lighter ver-
sion of the image (at top), the current version (in the middle), and a darker rendition (at
bottom).

In the upper-right corner of the dialog box is a control area that includes radio buttons
that let you choose shadows, midtones, or highlights for your correction, as well as sat-
uration. Beneath the buttons is a slider that controls whether your correction is subtle
(Fine) or dramatic (Coarse).

Four buttons also let you save the corrections you’ve made for use with the same
or another photo, load settings you already stored, apply the current corrections
(by clicking OK), or forget about the whole thing (by clicking Cancel).

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Correcting Tinted, Faded Photos
In the Putting-It-Together project that fol-
lows, I employ the Variations feature to
restore the color in a scan of a color print
originally made in 1965. Unfortunately, the
years have not been kind to this photo; it
has a slight, but annoying, greenish tinge
that’s a result of the magenta dye layer of
the print fading. As the magenta fades, the
other two color layers, cyan and yellow,
appear proportionately stronger when
compared to the magenta that remains
and, as you may recall, cyan and yellow
make green.
I plan to use the Variations feature of
Photoshop to restore the magenta layer in
this photo that’s green with age, putting the
ruddy glow back into the subjects’ cheeks.
To correct color cast in an old photograph
by using the Photoshop Variations feature,
follow these steps:

In Photoshop, open an old, fading
photo that needs color correction.
In this case, I’m using an old,
greenish-looking picture, but any
color cast will do. 
2.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Variations from the menu bar.
The Variations dialog box appears.
c Select the Show Clipping option
to tell Photoshop to show any
areas of the image that will be
“overwhelmed” by the correction
you’re contemplating. That is, no
new information is added.

stored, apply the current correc-
tions (by clicking OK) or forget
about the whole thing (by clicking
Cancel).
e Make adjustments with the
Fine/Coarse slider. 
In my example, the greenish picture
needs some magenta, so I dragged
the Fine/Coarse slider to the left
(the default midpoint is waaay too
much). 
You can also click one of the tick
marks to move the slider to that posi-
tion. Photoshop doesn’t allow setting
the control to any of the intermediate
positions between the marks.

Make sure that you have selected
the Midtones radio button, and
then click the preview window
containing the amount of color you
want to add. 
Watch the Current Pick thumbnail,
which reflects the correction.
In my case, I need to click the More
Magenta image. 
Click several times if your initial
application isn’t enough or click
other preview windows to add
other, additional colors.
Photoshop applies your corrections
only to the middle tones of the image.
In many cases, that’s sufficient.
However, sometimes shadows take
on a particular hue, or the highlights
may gain color casts of their own.
g Click the Highlights and/or
Shadows radio buttons to add colors
only to those parts of the photo.
Variations isn’t the best tool to make
complex color corrections, so be
careful.
You might be able to see a highlight
color in the shadows under the
pillow, most noticeable in the More
Magenta preview. The highlight is
the Clipping indicator showing that
the change made by that preview
window is too much for that particu-
lar area of the picture. That is,
Photoshop can’t add any more
magenta to the highlighted area
without losing detail in the image.
h Click the Darker preview (in the
lower-right corner of the dialog box)
to make the photo a little darker.
The Fine/Coarse slider has no effect
on the amount of change Photoshop
applies. Instead, you can click the
Lighter or Darker preview several
times to achieve the look you want.
In my case, only one click is
necessary.

Washing Out Color with Desaturate
Sometimes, you don’t want any color at all. Photoshop’s Desaturate command can wash all
the color out of a layer or selection, giving you a plain grayscale image. 
Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. Use this command with cau-
tion because neither the Desaturate command nor Photoshop’s Image➪Mode➪Grayscale
command is the best technique for converting a color image to monochrome. (See Book II,
Chapter 2, for a better method.)
What people perceive as contrast, or differentiation, between tones in an image is determined
in a color picture by more than the tonal values of the grays. Differences in color and satura-
tion are also perceived as contrast by our eyes. Simply removing the color can produce an
image that appears to be too low in contrast, which is another kettle of fish altogether.
However, if you simply want to eliminate the color from a layer or selection image quickly, the
Desaturate command does the job. To apply it, select the area you want to operate on and
choose Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate, or press Shift+Ctrl+U (Shift+Ô+U on the Mac).
I show you how to play with saturation using the Hue/Saturation controls later in this chapter.
Working with Professional Color Correctors
The simple color correctors I’ve shown you so far in this chapter usually aren’t enough to
provide thorough color correction if you have a really problematic image on your hands.
Fortunately, Photoshop has the kind of professional tools needed to make sophisticated color
corrections required for reproduction. You don’t have to be a pro to use the Levels or Curves
commands, nor to work with the Hue/Saturation controls. But you’ll feel like one after you
master these powerful tools.
Leveling for better contrast
I described the automatic variation of the Levels command earlier in this chapter. If you want
to adjust tonal values of images (the brightness or darkness of tones) or correct colors (the
relationship between the colors), this is the tool for you. Color Plate 8-3 shows an image that
came to life after an adjustment with the Levels command.
The Levels command is a much more sophisticated tool than the Brightness/Contrast control
because you can work with individual tones, brightening or darkening individual tones as you
want, and you have a great deal more information to help you make your choices. 
Open the Levels dialog box, shown in Figure 1-10, by pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L on the Mac) or
selecting Image➪Adjustments➪Levels. The graph shown in the center of the dialog box is a
histogram, which I described in detail in the first section of this chapter. Remember, you can
use the histogram to measure the number of pixels at each of the 256 brightness levels. Each
vertical line represents the number of tones at each of the brightness levels. The default his-
togram displays information for the entire image, but you can view separate histograms for
each of the Red, Green, and Blue channels (or the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black channels
if you happen to be working with a CMYK image).

Book VIII  Chapter 1: Enhancing Images with Adjustments
600
The horizontal axis displays the range of these pixel values, with 0 (black) on the left and 255
(white) on the right. The vertical axis measures the number of pixels at each level. The pat-
tern of lines in the histogram shows you when an image has a preponderance of one kind of
pixels (say, bright or dark ones), as well as gaps in the distribution that represent tones that
are not represented at all.
The three triangles at the bottom of the histogram, in black, gray, and white, represent the
shadow on the left, midtone in the middle, and highlight on the right. Even though they’re
located where they are, many images have no black tones at the far-left side of the scale, or no
white tones at the far-right side. (In Figure 1-10, for example, the shadow tone triangle is set at
the point where the image begins to have dark tones.)
One of the simplest corrections you can do is to move the black and white sliders so that they
actually correspond to the pixels containing dark and light tones. Simply slide the black trian-
gle so that it corresponds to the first true black pixels in the image (the beginning of the his-
togram), and then move the white triangle to align it with the lightest pixels (the end of the
histogram). That ensures that Photoshop doesn’t waste tones by allocating them to areas of
the image that actually have no image detail.
The Levels dialog box has an Auto button, which operates similarly to the Auto Levels com-
mand, except that you can see exactly what happens. When you click the Auto button,
Photoshop applies its own suggested changes, resetting the white point and the black point,
and redistributing the gray values of the pixels in between. Afterward, the histogram shows
that the pixels fill the complete range from white to black.

Setting black and white points manually
For more control, you can use the eyedropper tools in the Levels dialog box to set the black
and white points. Just follow these steps:

Image➪Adjustments➪Levels.
Make sure you have the Info palette
open and that the HSB and RGB color

adjustments, such as Levels, via an adjust-
ment layer rather than directly to the
image itself. Adjustment layers provide
more editing flexibility if you later decide

Adjusting curves for hard-to-correct photos
The Curves command is one of the most advanced Photoshop correction tools available,
offering sophisticated control over the brightness, contrast, and gamma levels in an image;
I’m talking about control that is far beyond that offered by the Levels and Brightness/Contrast
dialog boxes. This section introduces you to the functions of the Curves command, but you’ll
want to practice using it a great deal to gain the kind of experience you need to work with it
effectively.

you need to tweak the adjustment. For
more on adjustment layers, see Book V,
Chapter 1. 
2.
Select the White Eyedropper tool and
drag it around the image while watch-
ing the Info palette.
3.
Look for the lightest white in the
image, which may be anywhere
from 90 to 100%. Select that point by
clicking.
4.
Use the Black Eyedropper tool to
select the darkest black in the image. 
The combination of these two choices
redistributes the pixels from pure
white to pure black.
You can also reset the white and black
points by moving the position of the
white and black triangles on the input
sliders (upper scale). Or, you can enter
numbers in the Input Levels boxes. The
three boxes represent the black, gray,
and white triangles, respectively. Use
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and
black boxes.
5.
Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to
remove any color casts. Select a neu-
tral gray portion of your image, one
in which the Info palette shows equal
values of red, green, and blue.
Note that the Gray Eyedropper tool is
not available when working on
grayscale images.
Although you generally make changes to
the entire document by using the RGB
channel, you can apply changes to any
one of an image’s component color chan-
nels by selecting the specific channel with
the Channel pop-up menu.
6.
Adjust the output sliders. 
Moving the black triangle to the right
reduces the contrast in the shadows
and lightens the image. Moving the
white triangle to the left reduces the
contrast in the highlights and darkens
the image. 
7.
Adjust the midtones with the gray tri-
angle slider. 
The values you’re adjusting are called
the gamma values.
Dragging this triangle to the left light-
ens the midtones. Dragging it to the
right darkens the midtones while leav-
ing the highlights and shadows alone.
You can also move the gray triangle by
entering numbers from 9.99 to 0.1 in
the center option box. The default
value, 1.0, lies exactly in the middle of
the range.
If you’re working with a series of simi-
lar images (such as a bunch of video
captures), you can save the settings to
reuse them later.

Whereas the Brightness/Contrast dialog box lets you change an image globally, and the Levels
command allows you to change the shadows, highlights, and midtones separately, Curves
goes far beyond either of those settings. It lets you change pixel values at any point along the
brightness level, giving you 256 locations at which you can make corrections. You can work
with the combined Red, Green, and Blue color channels (or CMYK channels) or apply your
changes to the individual colors.
Here are some tips for using Curves:

Access the Curves dialog box, shown in Figure 1-11, by choosing Image➪Adjustment➪
Curves or by pressing Ctrl+M (Ô+M on the Mac).

The horizontal axis maps the brightness values as they are before image correction. 

The vertical axis maps the brightness values after correction. 
Each axis represents a continuum of 256 levels, divided into four parts by finely dotted
lines. In the default mode, the lower-left-hand corner represents 0,0 (pure black) and
the upper-right-hand corner is 255,255 (pure white). By default, the dialog box shows a
4 x 4 grid; Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) inside the grid to toggle it to a 10 x 10
grid, as shown in the figure.

Whenever you open the Curves dialog box, the graph begins as a straight line. Unless
you make changes, the input is exactly the same as the output, a direct 1:1 correlation.

When you use the Eyedropper tool from the Tools palette to click in the image, a circle
appears on the graph to show you the value of the pixel being sampled. At the bottom
of the Curves dialog box, you can read the pixel’s input and output values.

When you click the Auto button, the darkest pixels in the image (the deep shadows) are
reset to black and the lightest areas are set to white. As with the Levels dialog box, this
option is the easiest way to make a correction.

The Curves dialog box has black, white, and gray eyedropper tools you can use to set
the black, white, and midtone points, just as you can with Levels.
Figure 1-11

Adjusting curves
If you click at any point on the curve other than the endpoints, Photoshop adds a control
point that shows your position. You can remove a control point by dragging it downward until
it is completely off the graph.
Experiment with the curves to see how they affect the image. For example:

Flattening a curve lowers contrast.

An S-shaped curve increases contrast, especially in the highlight and shadow areas.
Using a curve like this also helps to define the midtones.

For ultimate control, Photoshop lets you draw a curve with the precise shape you’d
like, creating an arbitrary curve or map. Click the Pencil tool in the dialog box, and then
draw peaks and valleys in the Curves dialog box. Watch the changes in your original

Arbitrary maps, such as the one shown in Figure 1-12, create distinctive solarization color
effects as Photoshop warps the colors of your image.
Getting colorful with Hue/Saturation
Photoshop’s Hue/Saturation controls let you adjust colors based on their hue, saturation, and
lightness. The Hue/Saturation dialog box doesn’t work with the red, green, and blue (or cyan,

magenta, yellow, and black) channels of an image. Instead, it operates on the different colors,
or hues. You can select all the colors (Master) from the Edit pop-up menu, or choose one
color to modify.
Three sliders are in the Hue/Saturation dialog box. (See Figure 1-13.)

Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise or counterclockwise around the color wheel,
depending on the direction you move it. 

Saturation: Increases or decreases the richness of the colors in an image.

Lightness: Modifies the brightness values.
You can adjust any of these values by moving the sliders and watching the results in the
image window. The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors in their
order on the color wheel before you made any adjustment. The lower color bar shows how
the modifications you make affect the colors.
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between the color bars so that
you can define the range of color to be adjusted. You can select colors, add colors, or sub-
tract colors from the range by choosing one of the eyedropper tools and clicking in the
image.

The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful option for creating sepia
colored images, as in the Putting-It-Together project that follows.

Using the Colorize option
Use the Colorize option in the Hue/Saturation dialog box to change the color of any selected
area to a new, solid color. This is unlike the Hue slider, which changes only individual pixels
based on their present color values. Just follow these steps:

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Making a New Photo Look Old
Black-and-white photography is a newer
phenomenon than you might think.
Daguerreotypes and other early photo-
graphs frequently had a brownish or bluish
tone to them. These photos are often hand-
colored with paints, too. A great deal of
research went into producing the neutral
black-and-white photos you associate with
early- to mid-20th century photography.
You can create sepia-toned masterpieces
of your own. Or, if you like, you can create
a tint in green, blue, or another shade.
Toned pictures can create a mood or oth-
erwise transform a mundane photo into
something interesting.
In this Putting-It-Together project, I chose
a recent photo of a 2000-year-old Roman
aqueduct that has no nasty anachronisms
such as automobiles or satellite dishes in
it, which just makes it that much easier to
age. To get the full effect of this technique,
check out Color Plate 8-4.
The Photoshop Hue/Saturation feature is
all you need to perform this time-traveling
magic. Just follow these easy steps:
1.
Open the image in Photoshop and
convert it to black and white by
choosing Image➪Adjustments➪
Desaturate.
You choose this command instead
of the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale
command to convert the photo to
black and white because you’re
going to continue to work with it as
a color image — the image just won’t
have colors until you add them.

c Select the Colorize check box so
that you can add color to the image.
d Adjust the Hue slider to produce
the tone you’re looking for.
To produce a rich sepia tone, move
the Hue slider all the way to the left.
If you prefer green or blue or some
other shade, you can experiment
with this slider to get the exact
color you want.
5.
Adjust the Saturation slider to
modify the richness of the color.
I used a setting of 25. As you move
the slider to the right, the color
becomes more pure, until you end
up with a striking red at the far-right
position.
6.
Adjust the Lightness slider to
lighten or darken the photo,
depending on your mood.
Generally, you want to leave the
Lightness slider at the default middle
position. To create a darker, moodier
picture, move it to the left; to produce
a more faded look, move it to the right.
7.
When you’re satisfied with your
changes, click OK.
Now my photo looks as old as the
aqueduct.
You can create similar effects by
using the Photoshop Duotones,
Tritones, and Quadtones feature.

Matching Color Between Documents
The Match Color command enables you to match colors in a single image or between
images — a source image and a target image. But it doesn’t stop there. You can also match
colors between layers or even selections. You can further refine your correction by adjusting
the luminance and color intensity (saturation). This command is great for getting rid of color
casts in a single image. It also works wonders for matching the color of the lighting between
two images or layers — for example, if you want to realistically composite an image shot
under fluorescent lighting and one shot in natural light.
The Match Color command works only with RGB images, but be sure and apply this com-
mand before you perform any color conversions. 
Here is how to use the Match Color command to match one image with another:
1.
Open the two images you want to
match. 
If you want, you can make selections in
one or both of those images — for
example, if you are creating a compos-
ite image from two separate images
and want to match the lighting color or
skin tones. Without selections, the
overall target image is matched to
the source image. In my example in
Figure 1-14, I selected an image taken
outdoors in natural light and one taken
inside under fluorescent lights, which
gives it a nasty green color cast. I want
to eventually use the girl in each image
in a composite and therefore want to
try to match the skin tones.

Make sure your target image (the one
that needs to be corrected) is the
active file and choose Image➪
Adjustments ➪Match Color. 
If you are using a specific layer in your
target image, select that layer prior to
choosing the command. Make sure you
have selected the Preview option so you
can view your adjustments on the fly.
c In the Match Color dialog box, shown
in Figure 1-15, choose your source
image from the Source pop-up menu
under Image Statistics. Select None if
you’re working with only one image
(the source image and target image
are the same). 
Remember, the source image contains
the colors you want to match in the
target image.
d If you are using a particular layer in
your source image, choose it from the
Layer pop-up menu. You can also
choose the Merged option to match
the colors from all the layers.
e If you have selections in your images,
you can select one of the following
options:
 If you have a selection in your
source image but want to match the
colors from the whole image,
choose the Ignore Selection When
Applying Adjustment option. It also
applies the correction to the whole
target image as well.
 On the other hand, choose the Use
Selection in Source to Calculate
Colors option if you want to use the
colors in the selection in the source
image. Deselect this option to ignore
the selection in the source image
and match the colors from the entire
source image. 
 Select the Use Selection in Target to
Calculate Adjustment option if you
want to adjust the color only in the
selection in your target image. 
f Select the Neutralize option to
remove any color casts in the target
image.
When using the Match Color command,
your cursor becomes the Eyedropper tool.
This allows you to sample colors on your
images and look at the color values in the
Info palette while making your adjustments.
7.
Adjust the Luminance by moving the
slider or entering a value.
A higher value increases the brightness
in the target image. A lower value
decreases brightness.
8.
Adjust the Color Intensity of your
target image. 
A higher value increases the color satu-
ration, while a lower value decreases
the saturation. Moving the slider to 1
desaturates the image to grayscale.
9.
Use the Fade option to control the
amount of adjustment that is applied
to the target image, moving the slider
to the right to reduce the amount.

Increasing and Decreasing Color

Increasing and Decreasing Color
Increasing and decreasing color is a popular Photoshop activity, so having more than one
way to do it is no surprise. In addition to the Selective Color command, which I describe in
the following section, several other commands are a lot easier to understand — and a lot
easier to use.
This is the place to start reading if you want to know all about the Gradient Maps command,
and the various color mapper tools, all of which are designed to change the arrangement of
the colors in your photos in ways that don’t produce realistic-looking images. Images that
have been color-mapped are certainly interesting to look at.

Using the Selective Color command
The Selective Color command is chiefly of use for manipulating the amount of process colors
(that is, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) used in printing an image. In the Selective Color
dialog box, choose the color you want to edit from the Colors pop-up menu. Adjust the CMYK
sliders to modify the selected color. 
With the Relative method selected, you can add or subtract color. For example, if a pixel is 30
percent cyan and you add 20 percent cyan, Photoshop adds 6 percent cyan to the pixel (20
percent of 30 percent is 6 percent). 
With the Absolute method selected, Photoshop bases the amount of change on the exact
value you enter. For example, if a pixel is 30 percent cyan and you add 20 percent cyan, the
pixel changes to a total of 50 percent cyan.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Using gradient maps
Gradient maps convert your image to grayscale, and then replace the range of black, gray, and
white tones with a gradient of your choice, in effect colorizing your image — often in startling
ways.
Photoshop maps the lightest tones of your image to one color in the gradient and changes the
darkest tones to the other color of the gradient (assuming you’re using just two colors for the
gradient). Photoshop changes all the formerly gray tones to an intermediate color between
the two. When you use multiple colors or fancy gradients, the image really gets interesting.
Just follow these steps to try out this feature:
1.
Open an image and access the
Gradient Map, shown in Figure 1-17,
by choosing Image➪Adjustments➪
Gradient Map.
b Choose the gradient you want from
the gradient list.
This list is exactly like the one offered with
the Gradient tool. You can edit the gradi-
ent used for your map exactly as you do
for the Gradient tool. For more informa-
tion on choosing gradients, see Book IV,
Chapter 3.
c Choose either or both of these
options:
 Dither adds random noise to
smooth out the gradient and
reduces banding.
 Reverse changes the direction of
the gradient. 
Use the Reverse option to reverse the
image (creating a negative) quickly.
4.
Click OK to apply the gradient map.
If the effect is a little too intense for your
taste, try fading the gradient map
(Edit➪Fade Gradient Mask) and then
adjusting the Opacity percentage and/or
applying a different blend mode.

Adding color with photo filters
Last but not least in the group of new adjustments offered by Photoshop CS is the Photo
Filter command. Photographers will appreciate this digital adjustment that is reminiscent of
the analog method of placing a colored filter in front of a camera lens to tweak the color bal-
ance and color temperature of the light coming through the lens. This is a great way to make
an image appear cooler or warmer. Have a portrait where your subject appears a little too
bluish? Apply a Warming filter and bring some rosiness back into his or her cheeks. You can
also apply a colored filter to add a tint of color to your image.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:

Make sure you have the Preview
option selected so you can view the
results.
c In the dialog box shown in Figure

the filters on the Filter drop-down list.
If you opt for the custom color, click
the swatch to choose a color from the
picker.
d Select the Preserve Luminosity check
box if you don’t want the filter to
darken your image. Note that some
photo pros advocate not checking this
option.
e Adjust the Density slider to control
the amount of color applied to your
image.
A higher value provides a stronger
adjustment. Use the Density control
with restraint. Anything above 50%
produces a severe effect.

Warming filter (85) and Cooling filter (80)
Adjusts the white balance in an image. A photo
shot in a higher color temperature of light
makes an image blue, as shown in Color Plate

warmer, more yellow. Similarly, an image shot
in light of a lower color temperature benefits
from the Cooling Filter (80), which makes the
colors bluer.
Warming filter (81) and Cooling filter (82)
Similar to the preceding filters but for minor

Colors
These filters adjust the hue of an image. You
can choose a color to get rid of a color cast. For
example, if your image is too green, choose
magenta. If it is too blue, choose yellow. You can
also choose a color to apply a special effect. 
Playing with the color mappers
Photoshop also includes some fun-filled color mapping commands, so-called because they
change the colors of your image in specific ways. Two of them, Invert and Equalize, don’t even
have any options. They’re akin to single-step filters that you apply and forget. (I cover filters
in Book VII.) I show all the color mappers in Figure 1-19.
Invert
Invert simply reverses all the colors and tones in your image, creating a negative image.
Photoshop changes black tones to white; white tones to black; dark grays to light grays; and
colors to their complements. For example, a light yellow color becomes a dark blue, and so forth.
Some folks mistakenly think they can use this command to create a positive (or color cor-
rect) version of a scanned color negative. It ain’t so simple because color negatives have an
orange mask overlaying the color information. To really do that correctly requires a lot of
color correcting and tweaking. Don’t try this at home!

Increasing and Decreasing Color

Equalize
This command locates the lightest and darkest pixels in an image, defines them as white and
black, respectively, and then changes all the other pixels in between to divide the grayscale
values evenly. Depending on your image, this process may increase contrast or otherwise
alter the color and tones as the values are evenly distributed.
Threshold
Threshold converts your image to black and white, with all pixels that are brighter than a
value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that are darker than that value as black.
You can change the threshold level to achieve different high-contrast effects.
Posterize
This color mapper creates an interesting graphic effect by reducing the number of colors in
your image to a value you specify, from 4 to 255. Low values provide distinct poster-like
effects. As you increase the number of color levels, the image begins to look either more
normal, or a bit like a bad conversion to Indexed Color.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Cleaning Up a Line Art Scan
Line art consists of (you guessed it!) lines,
rather than the continuous tones of a pho-
tograph or painting. Line art can consist of
outlines, shapes (like you’d find in a bar
chart), patterns (like the fills in the bar
chart), or freehand drawings like those
produced in pen or pencil. Often, line art
consists of just one color, plus white, such
as black lines on a white background, or
colored lines on a plain background. Line
art can also include several distinct colors:
Your bar chart may have bars in a variety
of different hues.
What you don’t want to see when you
scan line art is an extra color: the back-
ground color of the paper, which should
be nominally white, but often doesn’t scan
that way. Often the paper appears as a dull
gray, and you may see other artifacts you
don’t want, such as wrinkles or spots in
the paper.
Luckily, Photoshop has a handy Threshold
command that you can use to determine
which tones appear as black and which
are dropped altogether. When you set a
threshold for your image, anything darker
than the brightness you choose is ren-
dered as black, and anything lighter is con-
verted to white. You end up with a nice
black-and-white line art image with all the
intermediate tones removed.

The Threshold dialog box includes a
chart called a histogram. The his-
togram includes a series of vertical
lines showing how many of an
image’s tones are represented by a
certain brightness level. You can see
that a relatively small number of
tones are represented by a bright-
ness value of 93, marked by the gray
triangle at the bottom of the his-
togram. Many more tones are used
at the other levels, forming a sloping
mountain in the chart.
c Move the slider to the right until
the tones you want to appear in the
image are shown.
The more you move the slider to the
right, the darker the image gets. A
threshold of about 189 seems about
right for this image.

Click OK to apply the modification.
Some small artifacts may remain in

O
ne of the coolest things about Photoshop is the way it
lets you choose one of several tools to accomplish simi-
lar end results, but with distinctly individualized looks.
The focus and toning tools in Photoshop are examples of
this. The focus tools blur, sharpen, and smudge your image in
much the same way as the Blur, Sharpen, and Liquify filters.
The toning tools lighten, darken, and change the richness of the
color in your image a bit like commands such as Levels,
Curves, and Hue/Saturation.
But where their counterparts operate only on layers or selec-
tions, the focus and toning tools let you paint the effects you
want directly onto your image. Using these tools, you can
create much more subtle, natural looks tailored to meet your
exact needs.
This chapter introduces you to the wonderful world of applying
focus and toning effects to your image. As you work through
the sections that follow, keep in mind all the tips I give you in
Book IV, Chapter 1, about using brushes. Most of that informa-
tion applies to the brush-like focus and toning tools, as well.
Lighten and Darken with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
Dodging and burning originated in the darkroom when photog-
raphers discovered that they could salvage negatives contain-
ing areas that were too dark or too light by adding or
subtracting a bit of exposure as an enlarger made prints.
An enlarger makes a print by projecting an image of a negative
onto a piece of photosensitive paper. During the exposure, the
darkroom worker can reduce the amount of light falling onto
the paper by placing some object (often a disk shape of card-
board or metal impaled on a piece of wire) in the light-path to

dodge part of the image. The worker can burn other parts of an image by shielding the entire
image from the light except for a small portion exposed through an opening, such as the fin-
gers in a cupped pair of hands. The Dodge and Burn tools in Photoshop adopt their icons
from the most popular real-world tools used to achieve these effects in the darkroom.
However, the Photoshop counterparts are a great deal more flexible than the versions used in
the darkroom. For example, the worker in a darkroom varies the size of the dodging or burn-
ing tool by moving it up or down in the light path. Unfortunately, the closer the real-world tool
gets to the paper, the sharper it appears, forcing the darkroom worker to move the tool more
rapidly and frequently to blur the edges of the lighten or darken effects. With the Photoshop
Dodge and Burn tools, you can set the size of the tool and its softness independently simply
by selecting a brush of the size and hardness or softness you require.
You can also set the Photoshop tools to operate primarily on shadows, midtones, and
highlights. You can adjust the degree of lightening and darkening applied by specifying an
exposure, too.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Using Dodging and Burning
The Dodge and Burn tools can be very effective tools, but remember that you can’t add detail
that isn’t there. Keep the following in mind:

When you lighten very dark shadows that contain little detail, you end up with grayish
shadows. 

Darkening very light areas that are completely washed out won’t look very good either. 
In either case, you’ll want to use the Dodge and Burn tools in moderation, and work only with
small areas. To dodge or burn a portion of an image, just follow these steps:
1.
Open an image with under- or over-
exposed areas and choose the Dodge
or Burn tool from the Tools palette. 
Press the O key to choose the active
toning tool, or press Shift+O to cycle
through the available toning tools until
the one you want is active.
2.
Select a brush from the Brushes
palette. 
Larger, softer brushes spread the dodg-
ing and burning effect over a larger
area, making blending with the sur-
rounding area easier. 
You can choose the same brushes
available with any of the painting tools,
including preset brushes from your
library. For more information on choos-
ing brushes, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
3.
From the Range options, select
Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights. 
Use Shadows to lighten or darken
detail in the darker areas of your
image, Midtones to adjust the tones of
average darkness, and Highlights to
make the brightest areas even lighter
or, more frequently, darker. 
In Figure 2-1, the original image (left)
had both dark and light areas, so I
dodged the shadows and burned the
darker stones.
4.
Choose the amount of the effect to
apply with each stroke using the
Exposure slider or text box. 

Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
621
Turning Down the Color with the Sponge Tool
The Sponge tool, which soaks up color like, well, a sponge, reduces the richness (or satura-
tion) of a color in the areas you paint. It can also perform the reverse, imbuing a specific area
with richer, more vibrant colors. 
Surprisingly, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode, pushing light and dark pixels
toward a middle gray, providing a darkening or lightening effect to those pixels. Unlike the
Hue/Saturation or Desaturate commands (Image➪Adjustments), which work only on layers or
selections, you can use the Sponge tool on any area you can paint with a brush.
You can use the Sponge tool on an image in subtle ways to reduce the saturation in selected
areas for an interesting effect. For example, you may have an object that is the center of atten-
tion in your picture simply because the colors are so bright (or even garish). The Sponge tool
lets you reduce the color saturation of that area (only) to allow the other sections of your
image to come to the forefront. You can also use the Sponge tool to make an artistic state-
ment: You could reduce or increase the saturation of a single person in a group shot to make
that person stand out (perhaps as being more colorful than the rest).

Paint over the areas you want to
lighten or darken with the toning
brush, gradually building up the
desired effect.
The Exposure control is similar to the
Opacity control offered by other paint-
ing tools, but it’s especially important
with dodging and burning.
Using a low value is best (I often work
with 10 percent exposure or less) so
you can carefully paint in the lighten-
ing or darkening you want.
High exposure values work too quickly
and produce unnatural-looking, obvi-
ously dodged or burned areas in your
images.
For an even softer, more gradual
effect, click the Airbrush option in the
Options bar.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
Although grouped among the Focus tools, the Smudge tool performs more of a warping effect,
something like the Warp tool in the Liquify dialog box (see Book VII, Chapter 3, for informa-
tion on this command).
Smudge pushes your pixels around on the screen as if they consisted of wet paint, using the
color that’s under the cursor when you start to stroke.
However, don’t view the Smudge tool as a simple distortion tool that produces only comical
effects. I use it on tiny areas of an image to soften the edges of objects in a way that often

Applying a Smudge

looks more natural than blurring tools. The Smudge tool can come in handy when retouching
images to create a soft, almost painted look, as you can see on the right in Figure 2-3, in which
the wrinkles around the neck have been softened.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Applying a Smudge
Smudged areas may stand out because of their smooth appearance. Adding some texture
using the Noise filter after you’ve smudged is often a good idea, to help blend a smudged sec-
tion in with its surroundings. You find tips on applying Noise in Book VII, Chapter 2.
To apply the Smudge tool, just follow these steps:

until the one you want is active.
2.
Choose the settings you want from the

Use a small brush for smudging tiny
areas, such as edges. Larger brushes
produce drastic effects, so use them
with care.
4.
Choose a blending mode from the
Mode pop-up menu.
5.
Choose the strength of the smudging
effect with the Strength slider or text
box. 
Low values produce a lighter smudging
effect; high values really push your
pixels around.

If your image has multiple layers, you
can select the Use All Layers option to
tell Photoshop to use the color infor-
mation from all the visible layers to
produce the smudge effect. 
The smudge still appears only on the
active layer, but the look is a bit differ-
ent, depending on the contents of the
underlying layers.
7.
Use the Finger Painting option to
begin the smudge using the fore-
ground color. 
You can get some interesting effects
with this option, such as the one
shown in Figure 2-4.
You can switch the Smudge tool into
Finger Painting mode temporarily by hold-
ing down the Alt key (the Option key on
the Mac) as you drag.

shutter speed. The Photoshop Blur tool makes painting your blur effects exactly where you
want them easy.
The Blur tool doesn’t push pixels around like the Smudge tool. Instead, the Blur tool
decreases the contrast among adjacent pixels in the area painted. 
The Blur tool is a good choice for softening edges or removing small defects. However, the
mechanics of using the Blur tool and several of its options are similar to those of the Smudge
tool. Just follow these steps:

2.
Select a brush from the Brushes

Cranking Up the Focus with the Sharpen Tool
In theory, the Sharpen tool is nothing more than the Blur tool in reverse — instead of decreas-
ing contrast among pixels, the Sharpen tool increases the contrast. In practice, however, you
need to use this tool with a bit more care. Where blurred areas tend to fade from a viewer’s
notice (at least in terms of how our eyes perceive them), sharpened areas of an image jump
out at people. 
If you blur an area a little too much, you may not even notice. But even a small area that has
been oversharpened can change the entire appearance of an image — and not flatteringly.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Sharpening an Image (With Care)
You can often successfully sharpen small areas with the Sharpen tool. Sometimes the eyes in a
portrait can benefit from a little sharpening. Or, you might want to sharpen an area to make it
stand out more distinctly against a slightly blurred background.
Here are the simple steps to follow to use the Sharpen tool:
1.
Choose the Sharpen tool from the
Tools palette.
Press the R key to select it directly if
it’s the last focus tool used. If not,
press Shift+R to cycle through the Blur
and Smudge tools to activate the
Sharpen tool.
2.
Select the brush of your choice from
the Brushes palette.
3.
Choose a blending mode from the
Mode pop-up menu.
4.
Choose the strength of the sharpen-
ing effect with the Strength slider
or text box.
Using a fairly low value (say, 25 percent or
less) is a good idea because you can build
up sharpness slowly, being careful not to
overdo it. 
You know you have gone too far with
the sharpness when the pixels start to
look noisy and grainy.
5.
Use the information on all your layers
for Photoshop’s contrast-increasing
algorithms by selecting the Use All
Layers option.
6.
Paint over the areas you want to
sharpen.
7.
When you finish, choose File➪Save to
store your image, which might look
something like Figure 2-6.
Sharpening increases contrast, so be
careful when using the Sharpen tool if you
plan to also adjust the Levels or Curves
controls. Any change that increases con-
trast in the whole image also boosts the
contrast of an area you’ve sharpened.
The Unsharp Mask filter offers more
options and better overall control, so
unless you really need to paint the sharp-
ening effect, you’re usually better off
using the filter. If you really want to apply
the effect with brushstrokes, you can
always apply the Unsharp Mask filter to a
whole layer, take a snapshot, undo the
filter operation, and then use the snapshot
as a source to paint from using the History
palette. See Book II, Chapter 4, for infor-
mation on how to paint from the History
palette.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Fixing an Underexposed Foreground
Sometimes editing tools just don’t cut the
mustard when it comes to fixing large
areas of an underexposed image. Instead,
you have to use three tools together to
repair the damage: a filter, a fill, and a
blend mode. 
If you’re like me, you’ve taken at least a
couple of photos where your subject was
lit from behind, thereby underexposing the
foreground and burying the subject in the
shadows. Here’s how to bring your subject
back into the light:
1.
Open the image in need of repair. 
2.
Choose Image➪Duplicate. 
3.
Name the file “Repair” and click
OK in the dialog box.
4.
Select Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. 
Photoshop has now stripped the
color from the image.
Don’t worry; this is just an interme-
diary step.
e On the duplicate image, choose
Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. Enter a
radius value and click OK.

S
ay you want to duplicate an element in your image. That’s
easy enough, right? Make a selection and copy and paste it
into the new location. Presto. That works fine most of the
time. But what if the element has a shadow behind it, next to it,
over it, or under it?
You face the dilemma of having a hard edge on the copied ele-
ment because the shadow (called a cast shadow) is cut off by
the selection outline. You could feather the selection, but then
you have to make sure that the copied element blends in realis-
tically with the background. What a pain. The better method is
to clone the element using the Clone Stamp tool. It’s quick,
easy, and no one will know that only one element was there
originally. 
Here’s another hypothetical situation: What if you already have
the right number of elements but some unsightly flaw mars
your otherwise perfect image? Or maybe the corporate execu-
tive, whose head shot you took last week, has requested a little
digital Botox around the eyes and mouth. No problem. You can
take care of wrinkles, scars, blemishes, scratches, spots, and
any other nasty imperfections in a matter of minutes in
Photoshop with the healing tools. And if your flaw is a nasty
case of red eye, you can grab the new Color Replacement tool
and take care of it with a few swipes.
In this chapter, I reveal secrets of cloning that won’t make
medical ethicists scream. And I show you how to heal scars,
scratches, and other imperfections without calling a plastic
surgeon.

more popular tools, always arouses a “Wow,” “Cool,” or similar remark of approval when
demonstrated.
The Clone Stamp tool takes sampled pixels from one area and clones (or copies) them onto
another area.
Believe it or not, you can also reach for this tool when retouching imperfections, such as
scratches, scars, bruises, and other minor flaws. In fact, that used to be one of its major func-
tions. In some retouching instances it does a great job, although the advent of the new Healing
Brush and Patch tools has relegated the Clone Stamp tool more to the pure cloning functions
and less to the hard-core retouching jobs.

Using the Clone Stamp tool
Cloning is often better than making a selection, copying, and pasting it because cloning allows
you to retain soft edges on details such as shadows, giving you a more realistic duplicate
image.
Follow these steps to clone an element without any genetic engineering:
1.
Open an image and select the Clone
Stamp tool from the Tools palette.
Press the S key on the keyboard. 
You have several options to choose
from on the Options bar.
2.
Select a brush and change its size or
shape in the Brush Preset picker
drop-down palette.
For more information on brushes, see
Book IV, Chapter 1.
3.
You can specify the Clone Stamp
tool’s brush size to control the area
that you’re cloning. 
I recommend having your Clone Stamp
tool cursor display your Brush Size so
you can judge the amount of the area
you are cloning. To do so, choose
Edit➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors
(Photoshop➪Preferences➪Display &
Cursors on Mac OS X). Select the Brush
Size radio button from the Painting
Cursors area of the dialog box. I used a
65-pixel, feathered brush. 
4.
Choose the blend mode of your
choice.
Selecting a mode such as Difference,
Multiply, or Color can produce some
interesting special effects. For more on
modes, see Book V, Chapter 3. I left my
setting at Normal.
5.
To make the clone more or less
opaque, use the Opacity slider or text
box on the Options bar.
I left the opacity at 100 percent.
6.
Specify how fast the Clone Stamp tool
applies the clone by adjusting the
Flow rate percentage. 
Again I left my option at 100 percent.
7.
Click the Airbrush option for
Airbrushing capabilities if so desired.

lected. I left mine selected.
9.
Select the Use All Layers option to

This tool samples pixels in all the visi-
ble layers for the clone. If you leave it

k Click or drag along the area where
you want the clone to appear.
As you drag, Photoshop displays a
crosshair icon along with your Clone
Stamp cursor. The crosshair represents
the source you are cloning from
while the Clone Stamp cursor shows
where the clone is being painted. As you
move the mouse, the crosshair moves
as well. This provides a continuous ref-
erence to the area of your image that
you’re cloning. Make sure and keep an
eye on the crosshair, otherwise you
may clone something you don’t want.
Try to clone your entire object in one
fell swoop so it doesn’t get fragmented. 
When you successfully complete the
cloning process, you have two identical
objects. Figure 3-2 shows my identical
twin Siberian tigers.

Tips for excellent cloning results
Here are a few useful tidbits regarding the Clone Stamp tool:

Use the Clone Stamp tool for fixing simple flaws: To clean up a flaw that is pretty
straight, such as a stray hair or scratch, Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) with the
tool to define the source. Then click at one end of the straight flaw and Shift+click at the
other end. The cloned source pixels then cover up the flaw.

Vary the origin point for sampling often: If you keep sampling from the same point
without ever varying it, the area you’re cloning starts to look like ugly shag carpeting.
Or at best, starts to appear blotchy and over-retouched. Zooming out once in awhile to
get an idea of how your overall image is looking is also good. This helps you avoid those
funky telltale clone stamp repetitive patterns and blotches.

Clone a selection and put it in a separate image: To clone between two images,
Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) inside one image to define the source in image
number one and drag inside image number two where you want the object to appear.

Clone patterns: To use the Pattern Stamp tool, which shares the flyout menu with the
Clone Stamp tool, select a custom pattern from the Pattern picker drop-down palette in
the Options bar. Drag with the Pattern Stamp tool, and you see the pattern appear.
Digital Bandaging with the Healing Brush Tool
The Healing Brush and Patch tools are similar to the Clone Stamp tool. They let you clone
pixels from one area and apply them to another area. But that’s where the healing tools leave
the Clone Stamp tool eating their dust. 
Figure 3-2

Resurfacing Wrinkles and Sags
635
The Clone Stamp tool used to be one of the main tools for retouching flawed or blemished
areas. But the problem was that if you weren’t careful, you could end up with telltale blotches
and smudged areas that were a sure giveaway that some retouching had occurred. That’s
because the Clone Stamp tool just takes the pixels from the sampled area and copies them
over the flaw. There is no consideration for the tonality of the flawed area — the shadows,
midtones, and highlights. So if the pixels you are sampling from aren’t shaded and lit exactly
like the ones you’re covering, you have a mismatch in color. This makes creating repairs that
are seamless and indecipherable to the eye hard.
That is, until the Healing Brush tool arrived. This very intelligent tool clones by using the
texture from the sampled area (the source) and then using the colors around the brush stroke
as you paint over the flawed area (the destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadows
remain intact, and the result of the repair is more realistic and natural — not retouched and
phony. 
To use the Healing Brush tool, select the tool that looks like a bandage. Choose your options,
such as brush size. Specify your Source option — Sampled or Pattern. For most retouching
jobs, Sampled will be the option of choice. Select the Aligned option. This allows your sam-
pling point to move in relation to your mouse movement. Establish the sampling point by
Alt+clicking (Option+clicking on the Mac) the part of your image you want to clone from.
Release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click or drag on the flawed area. Take a gander at
Color Plate 8-6 to see the results of the Healing Brush tool.

Resurfacing Wrinkles and Sags
While wrinkles, scars, bags, sags, and other
less than desirable facial imperfections
were once the domain of the Airbrush and
Clone Stamp tools, the flaws are now fair
game for the awesome Healing Brush tool.
The Healing Brush tool is a much more
effective flaw-fixing tool due to its ability
to preserve the various tones of an image.
Here are the steps to heal your favorite,
but imperfect photo:
1.
Open your image and select the
Healing Brush tool.
Use the J key to select it from the
keyboard. Note that you can also heal
between two images. Just make sure
that they have the same color mode.
2.
In the Options bar, click the Brush
Preset picker.
In the drop-down palette, select your
desired diameter and hardness for
your brush tip. You do this several
times while retouching your image.
It is important to use the appropriate
brush size for the flaw you are
repairing.
3.
Leave the blend mode set to
Normal.
You can change your blend mode if
necessary. For most simple retouch-
ing jobs, such as this one, you’ll
probably leave it at Normal.

4.
Choose a Source option.
You have a choice between Sampled
and Pattern.
 Sampled, which you will probably
use 99 percent of the time, uses
the pixels from the image. 
 Regarding Pattern, well, you can
probably infer that it uses pixels
from a pattern you have selected
from the Pattern picker drop-
down palette.
For my example, I am sticking with
Sampled because I don’t think my
guy would look that good with a 
Tie-Dye or Nebula pattern across his
face. He’s just way too corporate for
that.
5.
Select how you want to align the
sampled pixels.
When you click or drag with the
Healing Brush tool, Photoshop dis-
plays a crosshair along with the
Healing Brush cursor. The crosshair
represents the sampling point, also
known as the source. As you move
the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair
also moves, providing a constant
reference to the area that you are
sampling. However, if you deselect

the Aligned option in the Options
bar, Photoshop applies the source
pixels from your initial sampling
point, despite how many times you
stop and start dragging. I left
Aligned selected in my example.
6.
Establish the sampling point by
Alt+clicking (Option+clicking on
the Mac). Make sure to click the
area of your image you want to
clone from.
In my example, I clicked the smooth
area on the chin and portions of the
forehead.
g Release the Alt (Option on the Mac)
key and click or drag over the area
of your image that contains the flaw.
Pay attention to where the crosshair is
located because that’s the area you are
sampling from.
In my example, I brushed over the
wrinkles under and around the eyes
and on the forehead. I also zapped
some dark spots here and there. In
just five or ten minutes, this gentle-
man lost about ten years. Save the
file, close it, and send in your invoice

Patching without Seams
While the Patch tool is similar to the Healing Brush tool in theory, its application method is
slightly different. Instead of painting over the flaws with a brush, you select your flawed area
and apply a patch to that selection. The Patch tool does a good job in fixing larger flawed
areas or isolated imperfections rather than a few wrinkles or scars here and there. What’s
more, it’s a breeze to use. To apply a patch, grab the tool that looks like, well, a patch of mate-
rial. Specify either Source or Destination in the Options bar — Source if you want to select the
flaw, Destination if you want to select the good pixels. Drag around the flaw to select it and
then drag the selection to the portion of the image from which you want to fix. 
PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Repairing Scratches and Cracks
The companion tool to the Healing Brush
tool, the Patch tool also creates seamless
repairs, but uses a slightly different
approach. Here are steps to patching an
area in need of repair:
1.
Open your image and select the
Patch tool.
It looks like a patch of material. Use
the J (or Shift+J) key to select it
from the keyboard.

Choose Source or Destination in
the Options bar.
Choose Source if you want to select
the flawed area. Select Destination if
you want to select the good area
you want to clone from. You can
also choose a Pattern if so desired.
c Drag around the flawed area of
your image.
Think of the Patch tool as a kind
of super cloning Lasso tool. Drag
completely around the flawed area
as you would when selecting with
the Lasso tool. If you need to, you
can apply a slight feather of .5 to 2
pixels, depending on the resolution,
to soften the edge of the selection. I
selected my area without a feather.
You can actually select your flawed area
with any selection tool you like. After
you have your selection, then select
the Patch tool and proceed to Step 4.
d Drag to the area on your image that
you want to clone (or sample) from.

Replacing Color with the Color Replacement Tool
641
Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
The new Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an image with
the foreground color. You can use this tool in a variety of ways. Create the look of a hand-
painted photo by colorizing a grayscale image. Or maybe you just want to change the color
of an object or two, such as a couple of flowers in a bouquet. A practical use of the Color
Replacement tool is to easily paint away red eye. See Book IV, Chapter 1, for more on get-
ting rid of red eye.
The great thing about this new tool is that it completely preserves the tonality of the image.
The color that you apply doesn’t obliterate the midtones, shadows, and highlights as it would
if you were using the regular Brush tool. The Color Replacement tool works by first sampling
the original colors in the image and then replacing those colors with the foreground color. By
specifying different sampling methods, limits, and tolerance settings, you can control the
range of colors that Photoshop replaces.

Replacing Color with the Color Replacement Tool
The third weapon in this arsenal of retouching tools is a cinch to use. Here are the short steps
to replacing color:
Book

1.
Open your image and select the Color
Replacement tool.
It looks like a brush with an eye next to
it. Use the J (or Shift+J) key to select it
from the keyboard.
2.
In the Options bar, shown in Figure
3-3, click the Brush Preset picker.
In the drop-down palette, select your
desired diameter and hardness for
your brush tip. 
3.
Select your desired blend mode. 
Color is the default mode and works
well for most colorizing jobs. Use this
mode if you’re trying to get rid of
red eye.
Hue is similar to color, but is less
intense and provides a lighter effect.
Set your foreground color to Black in
the Tools palette and set the mode to
Saturation to convert a color image to
a grayscale image.
Luminosity is the exact opposite of the
Color mode and while it can create a
beautiful effect between two image
layers, it doesn’t provide that great of
an effect with this tool.
For a full “scientific” definition of each
blend mode, check out Book IV,
Chapter 1.
4.
Select your sampling method.
The default of Continuous allows you
to sample and replace color continu-
ously as you drag your mouse. Choose
Once to replace colors only in areas
containing the color that you first
sample by clicking. And finally, select
Background Swatch to replace colors
only in areas containing your current
Background color.

ing the sampled color wherever it
occurs in your image. And Find Edges
allows you to replace the color of
pixels containing the sampled color
while preserving the sharpness of the
edges of the objects.
6.
Specify your tolerance percentage.
Tolerance refers to a range of color. A
higher tolerance lets you replace a
broader range of color. A lower toler-
ance limits the replacement of color
only to areas that are similar to the
sampled color.
7.
Choose whether you want anti-aliasing.
Remember anti-aliasing slightly softens
and smoothes the edge of the selected
or sampled areas.
8.
After you establish your settings, click
or drag on your image.
Notice how the foreground color
replaces the original colors of the sam-
pled areas. Of course, the exact effect
you get depends on your settings.

Book IX
Photoshop and
the Web


P
reparing an image for display on a Web page can be just as
important as creating it. That razor-sharp, 6-megapixel
image you carefully composed through the viewfinder of
your digital camera may end up cropped, sliced, and trans-
formed into a miniature 128-x-128-pixel graphic perched in a
corner of your Web page. Visitors to your site are likely to be
more concerned with how quickly the image downloads and
how clearly they can view its content than its glorious digital
genesis.
Although Photoshop has some marvelous tools for optimizing
an image for the Web (see Book IX, Chapters 2 and 3), you can
(and should) prepare your images ahead of time. This chapter
introduces you to some of the tools and concepts you should
be familiar with before you start optimizing in earnest.
Understanding Resolution
When it comes to resolution, size matters. Resolution is always
expressed in units per length:

Dots per inch (dpi) for printed output

Samples per inch (spi) for scanned input

Pixels per inch (ppi) for images viewed on a computer
display
So what do you need to know about resolution if you’re planning
on putting images on the Web? Here are two golden rules to
follow:

Start out by creating the image at the resolution you’ll
use to display it. Images can lose detail when you change
the resolution settings after editing.

Choose the resolution based on what will look good on a 17-inch screen with resolu-
tion settings of 800 x 600. This is the standard display that most Web sites use. You
don’t need a high resolution if you’re going to display the image on a Web site. 
Different applications call for different resolutions. You’ll find more detailed information on
choosing the right resolution and how to change resolution, if you absolutely must, in Book II,
Chapter 1.
Picking a resolution (and sticking with it)
Changing resolution is often bad because you’ll always lose some image detail when you con-
vert from one resolution to another while resizing images. Therefore, it’s a good idea to create
a graphic destined for the Web at the resolution that you’ll use to display it. If possible, do not
create the image at a different size and change the resolution later.
So, when choosing the resolution and size of your images, keep in mind the final destination of
the image — that is, Web or print — and how large you want it to appear on the screen or
printed page.
Smaller monitors display images at 72 ppi. Larger monitors use 96 ppi or 120 ppi. You can use
these figures to visualize the size your images will appear on the displays of other users’ com-
puters. For example, a graphic that measures 150 pixels x 150 pixels appears to be about 1.25
x 1.25 inches on a monitor with 120 ppi resolution (rather tiny), but a little more than 2 x 2
inches (relatively large) on a smaller monitor with 72 ppi resolution.
Resolution values always translate into sizes. For example, a Photoshop image measuring
600 x 600 pixels created at 600 dpi will print as a 1-x-1-inch square on a 600 dpi printer because
each pixel is translated into one printer dot, or as a 2-x-2-inch square on a 300 dpi printer
(unless you tell the printer to scale the image to a different size) because each pixel will
translate into two printer dots.
Dealing with differences in monitors
You can’t control what size monitor and which resolution settings viewers use when they look
at your images online, but if you’ve read the previous section, you probably have had the
point driven home that you can control your images’ resolution. And at least that’s some-
where to start.
A Photoshop image measuring 600 x 600 pixels created at 600 dpi will appear as a 6.25-x-6.25-
inch square on a monitor with 96 ppi resolution or as a 5-x-5-inch square on a monitor with
120 ppi resolution.
The resolution issue of monitors can be confusing because the pixels per inch being displayed
varies depending on the resolution setting you’ve used. For example, consider a 19-inch moni-
tor that has a viewable width of 14.6 inches. You can set it to 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, or, like me,
1920 x 1440 pixels. The following mini-table shows the pixels per inch displayed:
Resolution

1024 x 768
14.6

Understanding File Formats

Obviously, the monitor doesn’t have a higher physical resolution at a higher screen resolution
setting. It just uses fewer of its dots to represent a screen pixel. When you get to a roughly 1:1
ratio, you’ve reached the maximum displayable resolution of the monitor. For example, the
top horizontal resolution of my 19-inch monitor is 2048 pixels, or 140 ppi.
The resolution settings you make in Windows are designed to approximate the physical pixels
per inch displayed so that objects appear at roughly the proper size on the screen. For exam-
ple, my 19-inch screen that can display 133 ppi at 1920 x 1440 resolution is set to 120 ppi, so
an object that measures 120 pixels wide appears to be 90 percent of 1 inch wide (120/133),
which is close enough. If I used 1024 x 768 on that same monitor, I’d set Windows to 72 ppi so
that a 72-pixel-wide object would be almost exactly 1 inch wide on the screen.
Understanding Color Modes
In Web graphics terms, color mode refers to the number of colors or grays that appear in an
image. Common modes include

Grayscale: 256 different gray levels

Indexed Color: 256 or fewer colors

RGB: 16.7 million different colors created from red, green, and blue values
Unfortunately, CMYK (approximately 55,000 printable colors created from cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black values) is not an option for Web display.
In practical terms, only Grayscale, Indexed Color, and RGB are used for the Web because
they’re the only modes supported by the two most popular Web-capable image file formats,
GIF and JPEG (described later in this chapter). (Actually, JPEG does support CMYK color, but
it must be converted back to RGB for display in a browser, so the option is of little value.)
The color mode you choose affects how your image is displayed. Modes of 256 (or fewer) colors
are great for images that contain a limited number of hues, but not for the display of images that
call for full color. But if you use RGB color mode with full-color images, they frequently (but not
always) produce larger files that take a long time to download. For reasons like these, you have to
make tradeoffs when selecting the right mode. Fortunately, the Save for Web feature (discussed
in Book IX, Chapter 2) enables you to compare the different modes and make a wise decision.
However, you can still work with colors manually, as you find out later in this chapter.
Understanding File Formats
Web browsers can display images in several ways. The fastest, easiest, and most compatible
solution is to use graphics that the majority of browsers can display natively, in-line (that is,
consecutively with text). Except for some browsers that display only text, the most commonly
used browsers can handle only files saved in GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group), and, in some cases, PNG (Portable Network Graphics) formats.
Browsers can display other types of images if users have installed the appropriate helper
applications or plug-in. For example, if you’re browsing and click a link that leads to a PDF
(Portable Document Format) file, your browser can display the file if you’ve installed the
Adobe Acrobat Reader plug-in and the Adobe Acrobat Reader application. (Most people have it;
Book

Chapter
1

Book IX  Chapter 1: Prepping Web Graphics
648
if not, most sites that include PDF documents also include a link to Adobe to download the
plug-in or the stand-alone free Acrobat Reader software.)
Flash animations are another kind of image that requires a plug-in to view. However, formats
other than GIF, JPEG, and PNG are beyond the scope of this book. All you really need to know
is how to choose between these three file formats. (The Save for Web feature can help you
make that decision, too; see Book IX, Chapter 2 for details.)
The following sections discuss each of the major formats and run down all the advantages and
disadvantages to using them.
Introducing GIF
The GIF format was one of the earliest image file formats developed for online display. It was
created back in the 1980s, even before the government-supported predecessor of the Internet
(called ARPANet) was transformed into the public information highway we have today.
The GIF format’s earliest use was at CompuServe, back in the days when dial-up modems moved
information at a sluggish 300 baud (roughly 100 times slower than the average dial-up connec-
tion today). As you might guess, the impetus to speed up image downloads was intense.
GIFs produce smaller files by discarding some colors, if necessary, to produce a file that has a
maximum of 256 different colors. Similar colors are combined into fewer hues, or represented
by a pattern of similar colors (called dithering) that the eye merges into an approximation of
the original range of colors.
If an image already has 256 or fewer colors, you may not have to discard any colors. Or you
can choose to reduce the number of colors anyway to produce an even smaller file size.
Although reducing the number of colors in a full-color image can produce an artistic effect,
like the one in the bottom image in Figure 1-1, in most cases you must reduce colors with care.
The GIF format’s 256-color palette is called indexed color. You can find more information on
indexed color in Book II, Chapter 2.
The kind of compression used for GIF files is called lossless compression because the image
can be uncompressed and reconstructed exactly as it was before compression. Of course,
information is lost when colors are discarded prior to compression (when you optimize the
number of colors); indeed, Adobe includes a GIF option called lossy, but that’s another story.
(For more about reducing the number of colors before data compression, see the later section,
“Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors.”)
The following two sections summarize the advantages and disadvantages to using the GIF
format.
GIF advantages
These are the advantages to using GIF files:

GIF files can be very small in size. If you start with an image that has few colors in it,
GIFs can be positively tiny. I’ve converted some logos with three or four colors into files
that are smaller than 1K. You can use a full 256 colors, slim down to a trim 128 colors, or
try to get away with 64 or 32 hues if your subject matter lends itself to serious reduction.
Bottom line: GIFs are great for images with 256 or fewer colors and can be useful with
many images with more colors, too.

Understanding File Formats
649

GIFs preserve the sharpness in your original image. Because no pixels are discarded
(only colors), sharp images remain sharp.
Bottom line: GIFs are excellent for line art, charts, graphs, cartoons, logos, and most
other images that emphasize solid areas instead of continuous tones.

GIFs can be interlaced. In this process, every eighth line is displayed as the file begins
to be downloaded, providing a rough image that can be viewed immediately. The other
lines are filled in until the full image is available.
Bottom line: Interlacing is mostly useful to visitors who have slow connections. Virtually
all graphics-capable browsers can display interlaced GIFs, but not all can display inter-
laced PNG or Progressive (JPEG’s flavor of interlacing) JPEG images.

GIFS can be made transparent. You can make a single color transparent to the browser
so that the underlying background shows through.
Bottom line: This is a great feature for creating “floating” images.

GIFs can be animated. Browsers display multiple GIF images consecutively as animations.
Bottom line: This is a great feature if you don’t overdo it by creating animations that are
huge and take a long time to download or that are annoying to visitors.

GIF disadvantages
Here are a few disadvantages to using GIF files:

Other file formats may produce smaller file sizes. Depending on the content of the
image, a well-optimized JPEG or PNG file can be smaller. Whether a GIF file is smaller
than a JPEG or PNG file depends on the number of colors in the original and how well
those colors can be combined in a JPEG or PNG file without losing too much information.
Of course, when you compare the file size, you should also compare the image quality. After
all, the proof is in the pudding.
Bottom line: Always compare the file size of GIF and JPEG images by using the Save for
Web feature to see which format provides the smallest file.

GIFs don’t preserve the colors in your images. Continuous-tone images, particularly
those with fine gradations of color (even something as simple as a drop shadow), may
display with objectionable bands of color in GIF format.
Bottom line: Use GIFs for graphics, especially those with broad areas of color, and use
other formats for photographs, in which a wide range of colors is important.
Introducing JPEG
The JPEG format was developed somewhat later than GIF in response to the need for a file
format that provides smaller images without sacrificing all the colors found in true photo-
graphic images.
The JPEG format reduces file sizes by using a somewhat different scheme than GIF, a type of
lossy compression that discards some image information as the image is squeezed down.
Each image is divided into 8-x-8-pixel blocks, the pixels in those blocks are analyzed, and the
pixels that are similar in color are combined. The color information for the pixels that are
merged is discarded, producing an image that has less detail than the original, but is still a
good representation of all the colors it contained.
As a result of this process, JPEG images have that distinctive blocky look when you zoom in
on them in Photoshop, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Knowing the differences between GIFs and
JPEGs helps you make your images more suit-
able for one format or the other. Here are some
tips for getting the most from these file formats:
 Make a better GIF. Modify your image so
that it contains larger areas of a single color;
reduce unneeded colors manually (you know
what they are better than the Save for Web
tool knows); convert anti-aliased lines to solid
lines where possible.
 Make a better JPEG. Decrease the color
saturation of your image. Lower the contrast.
Blur unimportant areas if feasible. The JPEG
algorithms do a better job on low-saturation,
low-contrast, blurry images than on vivid-
color, high-contrast, or sharp images.
Choosing between GIF and JPEG file formats

Understanding File Formats
651
You can choose the amount of compression the JPEG uses and, therefore, the tradeoff between
file size and sharpness. Photoshop uses a sliding scale from 0 (small file size/maximum com-
pression) to 12 (larger file size/minimum compression). The Save for Web command helps you
decide how to make the tradeoff for individual images.
You can also save JPEG files by choosing File➪Save (although saving via the Save for Web,
a feature explained in the next chapter, is the superior way to go). If you save from the File
menu, you can choose from these options:

Matte: Use this option to choose a color to represent any transparency in the image.

Image Options: Specify the amount of compression/quality level by using the slider
(from 0 to 12), or by typing a value into the Quality text box, or by choosing a quality
level from the menu.

Format Options: Select Baseline (“Standard”), a format compatible with virtually all
graphics-capable Web browsers; Baseline Optimized to create a file with optimized
color and a more compact file size; or Progressive to show a series of scans that
increase in resolution as the download proceeds (similar to GIF’s interlacing). You can
choose between three and five scans. Baseline (“Standard”) is the only option sup-
ported by all Web browsers.


Size: If you choose the Preview option in the Save dialog box, the Size area displays the
file size and approximate download time at a particular connection speed. You can
change the connection speed in the range 14.4 Kbps to 2 Mbps.
JPEG advantages
The advantages of the JPEG format are in many cases nearly identical to those of the GIF format:

The file sizes can be very small. In some cases, JPEGs are even smaller in size than
their GIF equivalents. The amount of compression you can use varies with the particular
image. Compression works best when you have images with lots of low-contrast areas
that have only subtle variations that won’t be missed when pixels are combined.
Bottom line: The JPEG format works best with images that can be squeezed without the
process becoming obvious to the unaided eye.

JPEGs preserve the colors of your original image. Gradations in tone are preserved
well, so your gradients and soft edges look good.
Bottom line: JPEGs are great for continuous-tone color photographs.

You can save JPEGs in Progressive format. Progressive format is similar to the inter-
lacing process most commonly used in GIFs, in which alternate lines are displayed as
the file downloads. 
Bottom line: Use this capability when you really need a full-color rendition and want to
provide interlacing for visitors with slow dial-up connections. If their browsers don’t
support interlaced JPEGs, they’ll still see the image.
JPEG disadvantages
The following list details the disadvantages of JPEG files:

Files saved in other formats may be smaller. Broad areas of a single color won’t be
compressed at all, so the equivalent GIF may be a lot smaller in size.
Bottom line: Compare the file size of JPEG and GIF images by using the Save for Web fea-
ture to see which provides the smallest file.

JPEGs don’t preserve the detail in your image. At high compression ratios, JPEGs can
take on an objectionable, blocky appearance.
Bottom line: Review the final appearance of your JPEG before using it. Some images can
take high compression and still look good, but others can’t.

JPEGs don’t support transparency. Often, you’ll end up using a GIF instead, even when
JPEG would do a much better job.
Bottom line: Choose your images carefully so that they don’t require transparency if
using JPEG is really important.
Editing JPEGs isn’t a good idea because each time you save a JPEG file, additional image data
due to lossy compression is lost. Work with an original TIFF or PSD file and save it as a JPEG
when you’re finished editing it. If you need to make additional changes, return to the TIFF or
PSD file.

The new JPEG 2000
As I mentioned way back in Book II, Chapter 2, JPEG 2000 is a new addition to Photoshop’s
list of file formats. It is a derivative of the standard JPEG format but offers additional
enhancements. Table 1-1 gives you the lowdown on the pros and cons to this new format.

If you decide that the positives outweigh the negatives, then you need to know about the vari-
ous options involved in saving a JPEG 2000 file. Note that the following options save the file in
extended JPEG 2000 (JPF) format. There is also a standard or minimal JPEG 2000 format (JP2).
After you click the Save button, the JPEG 2000 dialog box, shown in Figure 1-3, appears with
the following options:

File Size: You can enter a value to set a target size for the saved file. The Quality value
will adjust automatically to the best quality for your specified size. 

Lossless: Select this setting to compress the image without quality degradation, but
create a larger file. If deselected, you can drag the Quality slider to specify a quality set-
ting. Higher values result in better quality but a larger file. But, if you select a quality
setting that is inconsistent with your target file size, the File Size changes. 

Include Metadata: Select this option to include file information. Leaving this option
deselected will produce a smaller file.

Color Settings: Select this option to include ICC profile data. Leaving this option
deselected produces a smaller file.

Include Transparency: This setting preserves any transparency in the image. 

JP2 Compatible: Select this option to create a file that can be displayed in an application
that supports standard or minimal JPEG 2000 format but does not support extended
JPEG 2000 format.

Advanced Options: Click this button to access the following options:
 Compliance: Chooses various devices that support this format. Right now only
general devices, like browsers, are supported.
 Wavelet Filter: Specifies the type of numbers used to encode the file. Integer is a
good overall option for providing good image quality. Float is more accurate, but you
can’t use it with lossless compression. Float may also cause some degradation
around the edges of an image.
 Tile Size: Specifies the size of the tiles used in the image. Use 1024 x 1024 for a good
overall size. If you create a really small image, use a lower size. 
 Metadata Format: Saves various data with the image. JPEG 2000 XML is format
specific XML data, XMP is File Info data, and EXIF is digital camera data. 
 Color Settings Format: Includes color settings data in the image file. The ICC Profile
format option includes the ICC profile specified in the Save As dialog box. The
Restricted ICC Profile option saves a restricted profile used for portable devices,
such as cell phones and PDAs. This profile is for the JP2 format only. 

Optimization Order: Choose one of the following: Growing Thumbnail produces a
sequence of small thumbnails that get larger until they reach the image’s full size.
Progressive creates an image that gradually displays increasingly detailed versions

of the image. Note that Progressive JPEGs are large in file size and aren’t supported by
all applications. Color displays the image as a grayscale image first and then as a color
image. 

Region of Interest: As I mention earlier, being able to use regions of interest is one of
the advantages to this file format. If your image contains one or more alpha channels
(saved selections), you can choose them to define a Region of Interest. Select the alpha
channel from the Region of Interest pop-up menu. Then choose an Enhance value to
increase or decrease the quality of the Region of Interest relative to the rest of the
image. Be warned that by enhancing the area inside the region, the area outside the
region decreases in quality. This is done in order to leave the file size the same. After
the alpha channel is used, it will be deleted when the file is completely saved.

Download Preview: Choose a download rate from the pop-up menu. The estimated
download time is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the dialog box if you selected
the JP2 Compatible under JPF Settings. 
Understanding PNG
Is this finally the Year of PNG? I’ve been writing about the PNG (often pronounced ping) format
seemingly forever (actually, only since 1995 when the PNG standard was frozen). Every year,
support for the PNG format grows, but its actual usage remains pitifully small.
The chief roadblock has been a lack of browsers that support PNG fully, but that roadblock
has largely vanished. (The vast majority of browsers in use today, including Netscape 4.x and
later versions, as well as Internet Explorer 5.x and later, support at least some PNG features.)
However, only later versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support PNG
natively; other versions require a plug-in, which can be irritating to viewers of your Web page.
In the Mac realm, support is good. Although Web developers are a cautious lot and want the
largest group of people possible to be able to view their efforts, the main reason today that so
few people use the PNG format is that so few other people use it.
That’s a pity, because the PNG format is a potential GIF-killer. (It can give JPEG a run for the
money, too, but it’s not specifically designed to reproduce photographic-quality images.) The
features built into the PNG format (the letters of which are sometimes said to represent PNG’s
Not GIF) counter most of the objections to GIF. Because of that, the advantages greatly out-
weigh the disadvantages. So, I focus on the advantages to the PNG format only, as listed here:

It’s free. Unisys holds the patent on the compression algorithm used in GIF and charges
a royalty to any software vendor who wants to support GIF. The PNG specification is a
potential advantage because software developers can incorporate it into their products
without paying for the privilege.

It offers better compression. The PNG format produces files that are up to 20 percent
smaller than the equivalent GIF, but they sometimes can be larger. In fact, one disadvan-
tage is that they can sometimes be larger than the equivalent JPEG file.

It isn’t limited to 8-bit, 256-color images. In fact, the PNG format isn’t limited to 24-bit,
16.7 million color images. It can support a selected range of bit depths from 1 to 64 bits,
for zillions and zillions of colors. The bottom line is that the PNG format supports
Grayscale, Indexed Color, and RGB modes.
Book

Chapter
1

Book IX  Chapter 1: Prepping Web Graphics
656

It uses a smarter interlacing scheme. The PNG format provide images that fade in
faster and better than interlaced GIFs.

It offers four different types of transparency. The PNG format allows 64 to 254 (not 256)
different levels of transparency, so even full-color images can float over a background,
as shown in Figure 1-4.
The PNG format also offers some technical advantages that aren’t readily visible to the user,
such as the ability to adjust for variations in the display of images by certain devices (called
gamma correction) and an error-correction routine that patches images that have lost a bit or
two in transmission to your computer.
The PNG format does not support animation. A related file format, MNG does, but it’s used
even less widely than PNG.
Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
If you’ve tinkered with HTML, then you’ve probably at least heard of hexadecimal colors.
Photoshop’s Web-safe palette is a set of 216 colors that should, theoretically, be displayed by
any browser, regardless of whether the user’s video card displays 256 hues, 16.7 million, or
something in between. Using only these Web-safe colors is a way to ensure that your image
will be represented without dithering in any browser.
Of course, who views Web pages on a display using only 256 colors these days? Haven’t all
computers been furnished with video cards offering a minimum of full 24-bit, 16.7-million-color
images for ages and ages and ages? Well, not exactly.
Here are some instances when you might be working with 256-color images:

You’re using GIFs. Oops! GIFs always have 256 or fewer colors, even when you’re dis-
playing them on a full-color monitor.

A visitor is using a computer on which resolution is more important than the number of
colors. Users who don’t edit graphics may need 1600-x-1200-pixel resolution on their
large-screen displays and not care that their older video cards offer only 256 colors at
that resolution.

Your visitor is using a PDA, Web-capable cell phone, or some other device that has an
LCD display that doesn’t support more than 256 different shades. If your Web page
needs to reach these people, you may need to consider a Web-safe palette for at least
some of your images.
Figure 1-4

Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
657
In all of these cases, you may need to use the Web-safe palette features to optimize your colors.
If you’re going to make a wholesale conversion of the colors in an image to a Web-safe palette,
you’re better off using the Save for Web feature, which is automated and provides visual feed-
back of your results.
Selecting individual Web-safe colors
Photoshop lets you select individual colors based on their Web-safeness. You can do that
two ways:

Access the Adobe Color Picker by double-clicking the Foreground or Background color
box in the Tools palette. Select the Only Web Colors check box, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Now, the Color Picker displays only Web-safe colors, and you can choose any of them.
If you don’t select the Only Web Colors check box, the Adobe Color Picker still lets you
know when you’ve selected a nonsafe color. A small cube appears above the selected color
patch in the dialog box (to the left of the Custom button).

In the Color palette, choose Make Ramp Web Safe from the palette options menu. You
can also select Web Color Sliders from the same menu. When you select either option,
the colors shown in the color bar and/or selected by the color sliders are Web safe. In
the case of the sliders, the sliders automatically snap to a value that is Web safe and do
not allow the selecting of intermediate values.
So what are hexadecimal colors?
Hexadecimal colors are simply a way of representing hues in the notation used by computer
programmers. Hexadecimal values are calculated by using the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A
through F. Fortunately, you don’t need to bother with the math. You just need to know that a
hex value from 00 (no color) to FF (maximum color) represents the 256 shades of red, green,
and blue.

For example, a value of F0306F might represent a deep rose color. This cryptic value can be
broken into three parts: Red — F0 (240 in decimal); Green — 30 (230 in decimal); and Blue —
6F (111 in decimal). The hex numbers are handy because you can enter them into HTML text
to reproduce the color.
You can read the hexadecimal values of a selected color in the Info palette and use the same
values to specify that color in any dialog box (such as the Adobe Color Picker) that accepts
them. You are also likely to use these values when you use HTML or another markup language
to specify the text and background colors on your Web page or Web site.
Keeping Color Consistent in Web Images
Now that you understand what a Web-safe palette is and how hexadecimal colors work, let me
just make a general comment or two about working with color Web images. Granted, getting
color consistent and optimal for print purposes is probably more challenging; there are a
couple issues to consider for the Web as well. First, your images will be viewed on a wide vari-
ety of monitors, operating systems, and computer platforms. This alone will cause the images
to display differently. In addition, most Web browsers do not take into account an image’s
embedded ICC profile (see Book II, Chapter 3). Raw RGB color data is all that displays. Only
Internet Explorer and OmniWeb for the Mac can interpret ICC profiles. So again, how your
image is viewed depends on the viewer’s computer system/monitor. Some of the things you
can do to help remedy the situation are the same things you do for working with color for
print, and a couple are unique:

Set up the optimum image editing environment. Keep your desktop a neutral gray,
eliminate distracting surroundings, and so on. This is described in detail in Book II,
Chapter 3.

Calibrate your monitor! Set your monitor to its optimum viewing state and keep it that
way. This is also described in detail in Book II, Chapter 3.

Establish your color settings. I recommend that if you’re cranking out lots of Web
images to use the Web Graphics Defaults as your setting. This will enable you to pro-
duce images in the sRGB color space and increase the chances that your images will be
displayed correctly and consistently. Color management is described in detail in, you
got it, Book II, Chapter 3.

Convert any non-sRGB profiled documents you have to sRGB. To do this, choose
Image Mode Convert to Profile. Select sRGB under Destination Space.

Finally, use the Save for Web feature to save all your Web images. This way you have
more control over how your images are optimized. You can choose how many colors
are displayed, what palettes are used, and so forth.
Making Type Look Good On-Screen
The last thing you may want to consider when prepping your images for the Web is how your
type looks. You can make changes as you prepare or edit the image that will affect how well
your type shows up on-screen. The following sections describe some of your options.

Making Type Look Good On-Screen
659
Anti-aliasing
For most non-Web applications, you’ll generally want to use one of the Photoshop anti-aliasing
schemes. (You can find more on anti-aliasing type in Book IV, Chapter 4.) Photoshop offers five
different anti-aliasing methods (which are shown in Figure 1-6):

None uses no anti-aliasing. Although it depends on the font, this choice is often a
good choice for small type. There a few fonts specifically designed for use without 
anti-aliasing. When used with anti-aliasing turned on, these fonts look atrocious.

Sharp applies only enough anti-aliasing to soften the edges of diagonal strokes, keeping
the type quite sharp. This is another sensible choice for smaller type.

Crisp increases the amount of anti-aliasing a bit, but the type still looks fairly sharp.

Strong gives the type a heavier appearance.

Smooth provides the maximum amount of anti-aliasing but can slightly affect the sharp-
ness of the type.
Although these recommendations usually hold true, your results may vary depending on
specific typeface and size; you may want to experiment in some cases.
Fractional width/system layout
At small sizes and low resolutions, such as those typical of Web display, type can be rendered
inconsistently with the default Photoshop type setting of Fractional Width. In this mode,
Photoshop varies the distance between characters by using fractions of whole pixels. At sizes
smaller than 20 points, such type may either have too much space between characters, or not
enough space, causing the characters to run together.
Sharp
Smooth
Strong
None

To prevent this, choose System Layout from the Character palette options menu. System
Layout displays text as the operating system would by using a program like WordPad or
SimpleText. Photoshop switches to whole pixel increments and removes all anti-aliasing. The
type won’t look quite as neat, but the spacing problems will be prevented. It can also be a
good choice for smaller text.
Faux styles
Photoshop cobbles together imitations of italic or bold typefaces for fonts that don’t have
them. The program normally does a pretty good job of slanting the Roman (upright, or
normal) version of the type, or making the type thicker to simulate bold. However, at smaller
type sizes and for type displayed online, the results are often less than pleasing. So when cre-
ating type for online display, try to avoid using the Faux styles.
To apply these styles, choose Faux Bold or Faux Italic from the Character palette options
menu or click the Faux Bold or Faux Italic button that appears near the bottom of the
Character palette, as shown in Figure 1-7.

A
fter you’ve done all your prep work for images destined
for Web display (as described in Book IX, Chapter 1), it’s
time to optimize them so that they’ll look their best,
download their fastest, or some combination of the two. Save
for Web is one of three methods available to you in Photoshop
to create those optimized images. You can manually tinker with
your graphics by using some of the tips offered in Book IX,
Chapter 1, and then save the images in a Web-friendly file
format. Or you may elect to jump to ImageReady and use some
of the tools built into that stand-alone program (including the
powerful animation tools described in Book IX, Chapter 5).
In most cases, however, Save for Web provides the kind of
automation and preview capabilities you need right inside
Photoshop itself. This chapter introduces you to this multi-
layered tool and its multilayered capabilities.
Quality or Loading Time
One thing to keep in mind as you work with Save for Web is that
optimization always involves trading off between two goals that
conflict with each other to a certain extent:

Image quality: With a few exceptions confined to the
artistic realm, you’ll generally want your image to appear
on a Web page as sharp as it possibly can be, with the full
range of colors shown in the original. The best quality
image should also be sized to fit in well with your Web
page design, no matter what size browser window users
are viewing a page through.


Download speed: Short download times are desirable, with no exceptions. The ideal
Web page image should appear on-screen as quickly as possible, regardless of the user’s
connection speed. Although fast loading times are essential when users have pokey
14.4K to 33.3K connections, you’ll also want fast download speeds for those using 56K
dial-up links, 128K ISDN connections, or 256K and faster cable modem/DSL broadband
links.
Unfortunately, you can’t fully meet either of these two goals at all times. The best quality
images and the largest and flashiest photos also take the longest to download. Conversely, the
images that download the fastest can potentially look the worst.
But don’t panic yet. You can make tradeoffs to ensure that your images have the quality you
expect and the fast download times that users demand. By choosing the best file format for
your image, making some choices about how much quality you’re willing to give up, and
tweaking your image with Photoshop, you can frequently get the best of both worlds. Book IX,
Chapter 1 offers some advice on some of the manual prep you can do. Save for Web provides
the automated half of that equation.
In fact, Save for Web has the simplest automation tool of all: Optimize to File Size, shown in
Figure 2-1. This option is tucked away in the Save for Web dialog box’s palette menu (see the
next section for more on this dialog box). Select the file size you want, click a few other set-
tings, and Photoshop gives you a file that meets that file size requirement.
Exploring the Save for Web Dialog Box
You can access the Save for Web dialog box by choosing File➪Save for Web from the menu
bar. The dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2, has four tabbed pages, a tools palette, a clutch of
options and menus, and a generous preview window that you can use to evaluate your results.
The following sections briefly describe each of the dialog box’s key components.
Tools palette and image preview
At the left edge of the dialog box is the Tools palette, which includes four tools and a preview
box that closely resemble their counterparts in the main Photoshop program. Here’s a quick
rundown, from top to bottom, of the Tools palette options:

Hand tool (H): Select this tool and then drag in the preview window to move the image.

Slice Select tool (K): Use this tool to select slices. For more information on creating
slices, see Book IX, Chapter 3.

Zoom tool (Z): Use this tool or press the spacebar and press Ctrl in Windows (or press
the spacebar and press Ô on the Mac) to zoom in. To zoom out, press the spacebar and
press Alt in Windows. On the Mac, press the spacebar and press Option.
If you’re using the Hand tool, you don’t have to press the spacebar if you want to zoom out
or in. Hold down Alt or Ctrl (Option or Ô on the Mac) to zoom out and in, respectively.

Eyedropper (I): Use the Eyedropper tool to sample colors in the preview image. If
you’re sampling in a GIF or PNG image, the Color Table is available and, if shown, high-
lights the color you sample in the table. For more information on GIF, PNG, and JPEG file
formats, see Book IX, Chapter 1.

The Save for Web dialog box also lets you control your view of images. Along the bottom of
the window, you see these options:

Zoom Level: Type in a zoom value here, or choose zoom levels from 12.5 percent to
1,600 percent, or select Fit on Screen.

Status bar: This bar shows the RGB values of the color under the cursor, the value of
any alpha channel, and the Hex values and Index.

Browser preview: Click to preview the image in the browser selected from the pop-up
menu.
The majority of the Save for Web dialog box shows you a preview of the image you’re working
with:

Preview windows: The tabs at the top of the window show the original image, or one of
three other optional views. See the “Introducing Preview options” section, later in this
chapter.

Preview status: This area shows the size of the original image, as well as various param-
eters of optimized images, such as download speed and number of colors.
Change settings
Along the right side of the window, you can make adjustments to the various color, file, and
size settings for your image. Here’s a rundown of what you see:

Save/Cancel/Done buttons: Use these buttons to save an optimized image, cancel the
operation, or indicate that you’re done optimizing.

Preset: You can choose settings, including the type of file. These settings are described
in detail later in this chapter.

Color Table: Shown only when a GIF or PNG image is selected in the Preview window,
this tab displays the Color Table for the optimized image.

Image Size: Click this tab to resize your image.
Introducing Preview options
You have four Preview options:

Original: Fills the preview with the original image, giving you a chance to review it,
zoom to the desired size, or divide the image into slices to be optimized separately.

Optimized: Fills the preview window with the optimized version of the original image. If
you like, you can make all your optimization settings with only this view available. You
can compare your results with the original by clicking the Original tab.

2-Up: Divides the preview window in two and shows the original on the left and the
optimized version on the right, with information about each in the status box below
the previews.


4-Up: Divides the preview window into four panes. The original image is shown in the
upper-left corner, and three different optimized versions are shown in the other three
panes (refer to Figure 2-2).

Optimizing Your Image
Before getting into the nitty gritty of working with the tools and options described in the pre-
ceding sections, I’m going to give you a quick overview of the procedures for using the Save
for Web dialog box. To optimize an image, you follow these steps:
Book
IX
Chapter
2
1.
Open the image in Photoshop.
2.
Choose File➪Save for Web.
3.
Select the kind of preview you want
to use by clicking one of these four
tabs:
 Original
 Optimized
 2-Up
 4-Up
Although the upper-left pane displays the
original image by default, you can select
this pane and change into a fourth opti-
mized preview.
4.
Click in any of the four panes and, in
the Settings area of the dialog box,
choose the kind of optimization you’d
like to apply to that version.
These options are explained in detail
throughout the rest of this chapter.
5.
After you have fine-tuned the opti-
mization settings and are satisfied
with the results, select one of the pre-
views and click Save.
Your image is stored on your hard
drive with those optimization settings.
6.
Repeat Step 5 to create as many dif-
ferent versions as you like, using a
different optimization method for
each.
JPEG Options
To optimize an image as a JPEG, choose the file format by doing one of the following:

Choose one of the preset JPEG optimization settings from the Preset pop-up menu:
 JPEG High: High quality (low compression)
 JPEG Medium: Medium quality (medium compression)
 JPEG Low: Low quality (high compression)
If you save your own presets for optimization settings, they’ll appear in the same list.

Choose the JPEG file format and Maximum, Very High, High, Medium, or Low directly
from the Optimized file format and Compression quality pop-up menus, shown in
Figure 2-3.

Book IX  Chapter 2: Optimizing Images with Save for Web
666
Then select any or all of these options:

Progressive: This option creates a low-resolution version of the image that downloads
quickly (much like an interlaced GIF) and that is followed by progressively detailed
overlays until the full image is seen. Again, not all browsers can benefit from this set-
ting. You can find out more about interlacing in Book IX, Chapter 1.

ICC Profile: Choose this option to embed the ICC color profile of the image in the JPEG
file. Very few browsers can correct the colors they display based on this information,
and because it adds about 3K to your file size, you’re better off leaving it deselected for
now. For more on color management, see Book II, Chapter 3.

Optimized: This option creates a JPEG file that is occasionally a little smaller at any
quality setting (and often doesn’t change the size at all), but not all browsers can dis-
play images with this type of optimization. If you feel your page will be viewed by many
users with older browsers, you might want to forego the small additional size reduction.


Quality: You can specify an exact quality/compression level by using a slider or by
typing a value into the text box.

Blur: Images that are slightly blurred can be squeezed more thoroughly by using the
JPEG compression scheme. If your image still looks good with a tiny bit of blur applied,
you can use a setting of 0.1 to 0.5 to gain a smaller file size. However, most likely you
won’t want to sacrifice image detail, in which case it is better to go with a higher rate of
compression and leave the blur setting at 0.

Matte: This setting lets you specify a color to use to fill in pixels that were completely
or partially transparent in the original. Partially transparent pixels are blended with the
color you choose. Select a color from the pop-up menu, or click in the color swatch to
select a color from the Color Picker.
You can save any customized JPEG settings you make by choosing Save Settings from the
dialog box’s palette menu. Your stored settings then appear in the Settings menu for reuse.

Chapter
2
You can use the Mask button next to the Quality
box to selectively apply different quality levels to
different areas of your image. This is called
Weighted Optimization. To use this option,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Mask button (see Figure 2-3).
2. Select whether you want to use all
text layers, all vector shape layers, or
both. You can also select one of the
alpha channels.
For more on vector shapes, see Book IV,
Chapter 2. For more on alpha channels, see
Book VI, Chapter 1.
3. Adjust the minimum and maximum
quality sliders in the Quality bar to the
levels you want.
For example, you can specify a minimum
quality level of 19 percent and a maximum
quality level of 62 percent. Photoshop will use
the grayscale values found in the masks
and/or alpha channels you’ve selected to
apply those quality levels. Photoshop opti-
mizes the lightest areas of the mask at the
highest quality level you’ve specified  and the
darkest areas of the mask at the lowest qual-
ity level you’ve specified.
See the GIF optimization options later in this
chapter for more ways to weight optimization
by using masks.
4. Click OK to apply the weighted
optimization.

You have some additional options in the Preview Menu pop-up menu (called out in Figure 2-3),
including a choice of browser dither schemes, whether you want to hide slices created auto-
matically (see Book IX, Chapter 3 for more on slices), whether to include the color compensa-
tion option, and the display of the estimated time for downloading.
GIF Options
The GIF options, shown in Figure 2-4, are generally different from those available for JPEG, as
befits the very different nature of the GIF image.
File Format
To optimize an image as a GIF, choose the file format by doing one of the following:

Choose one of the preset optimization settings from the Settings pop-up menu. You’ll
find presets for GIF 128, GIF 64, and GIF 32 (both dithered and undithered), plus GIF
Restrictive. The figures represent the number of colors in the GIF image.

Choose the GIF file format directly from the File Format menu.

Color Reduction Algorithm
This menu includes three categories of options for creating a palette for the Color Table:

Dynamic: The options in this category include:
 Perceptual: Favors colors the human eye is most sensitive to.
 Selective: Weights the colors toward those considered Web safe.
 Adaptive: Builds a Color Table emphasizing the portion of the spectrum containing
the colors that are most commonly found in the image — for example, greens in
scenic photos or flesh tones in portraits.
 Restrictive: Also called Web-safe. Uses a 216 Windows palette and a 256 Mac palette.
Ensures that the browser will not dither 8-bit color images. Be warned that it can
create larger files.
With the dynamic options, a new palette of colors is collected every time you change
or optimize the image.

Fixed: These options include Mac OS and Windows (the palettes used by the Mac and
Windows operating systems, respectively), Grayscale, and Black and White. The colors
available are fixed, but the actual colors used vary with the image they are applied to.

Custom: This option uses a fixed color palette created by the user, but which is not
updated automatically when the image is modified.
You can also apply weighted optimization to color reduction by clicking the Mask button next
to the Color Reduction Algorithm box, and selecting the mask as described in the sidebar,
“Selectively changing quality levels in an image.”
Dithering Algorithm
Choose the dithering scheme used to simulate colors that can’t be represented by the hues in
the Color Table. Your choices are Diffusion (a random type of dithering), Pattern (a regular,
halftone screenlike pattern), Noise (a random pattern that doesn’t spread across pixels), and
No Dither. You can also choose the amount of dithering to allow in the Dither slider or text box.
You can also apply weighted optimization to dithering by clicking the Mask button next to the
Dither box, and then selecting the mask and amount of dithering as described in the sidebar,
“Selectively changing quality levels in an image.”
Transparency and Matte
Choose Transparency and Matte options to control how transparent pixels are handled during
optimization. Select a matte color from the menu, or click the matte color patch and choose a
hue from the Color Picker. You’ll want the matte color to match the background color of the
Web page as closely as possible.

Select transparency and a matte color. This option keeps transparent pixels in the
original image transparent and blends partially transparent pixels with a matte color
you choose.
Book
IX
Chapter
2

Book IX  Chapter 2: Optimizing Images with Save for Web
670

Select transparency and no matte color. Choosing None from the Matte menu makes
transparent pixels and those that are more than 50 percent transparent fully transparent,
while rendering pixels that are 50 percent or less transparent as fully opaque.

Select no transparency and a matte color. Deselecting transparency and choosing a
matte color fills pixels that are completely transparent with the matte color you select
and blends them.
Consult an HTML manual to find out how to determine the hexadecimal values of the
background colors of the page. You can find a description of hexadecimal colors in Book IX,
Chapter 1.
Transparency Dithering
Set the options for Transparency Dithering. This option determines how Photoshop will
dither pixels that are partially transparent:

No Transparency Dither: Leaves partially transparent pixels in the image alone.

Diffusion Transparency Dither: Adds a random pattern to partially transparent pixels.
Like diffusion dither, the pattern is spread across adjacent pixels. You can specify the
degree of dithering with the Amount box/slider.

Pattern Transparency Dither: Applies a halftone-like pattern to the pixels that are par-
tially transparent.

Noise Transparency Dither: Applies a random, nondiffused pattern to the semi-
transparent pixels.
Specify the amount of transparency dithering by moving the slider or entering a value.
Interlaced
Choose whether you want the image interlaced (to appear gradually in the browser when it
downloads) or not interlaced.
Lossy
Select the amount of lossy file compression allowed in the Lossy slider or text box. You can
use masks to add weight to lossy compression by clicking the Mask button and applying the
mask settings as described earlier in the chapter.
Colors
Choose the number of colors in the image from the Colors list. Select a specific number of
colors from 2 to 256, or choose Auto to let Photoshop choose the number of colors automati-
cally based on the colors in the Color Table.

Optimizing Your Image
671
Web Snap
Use the Web Snap slider or text box to specify a tolerance level that will automatically change
pixels that are within that tolerance level of a Web-safe color to that Web-safe hue. The higher
the value, the more Web-safe colors the image has.
PNG Options
If you elect to create a PNG file, two sets of options are available for the two types of PNG files:
PNG-8 (256 colors) and PNG-24 (16.8 million colors).
The PNG-8 options, shown in Figure 2-5, are similar to the GIF options (described earlier in the
chapter), with the following exceptions:

Lossy compression is not available for PNG-8.

Weighted optimization can be applied to the color reduction and dithering algorithms,
which are otherwise similar to those used with GIF.
The PNG-24 options include only interlacing and the transparency/matte options described
under GIF options, as shown in Figure 2-6.

Image Size
The Save for Web dialog box includes its own version of the Image Size dialog box, which
resides on a separate tab, next to the Color Table tab, as shown in Figure 2-7. Although slightly
different in appearance, it operates the same as the Image Size dialog box. You can specify a
new width and height for the image or change the size by a percentage. You also can select
the type of resampling performed when resizing the image, although you’ll almost always
want to use the default Bicubic algorithm. For more information on changing image size, see
Book II, Chapter 1.

You can manually shift one or more colors toward Web-safety (discussed in more detail in
Book IX, Chapter 1). You can also change specific colors in an image that has already been
converted to 256 colors (see Book II, Chapter 2 for details) to make them Web safe. Just follow
these steps:

re the images on your Web page an attraction or a dis-
traction? Do they invite visitors to explore your page, or
send them fleeing to the Back button? Attractive images
that load quickly are the key to captivating those who visit your
site. Unfortunately, even the most gorgeous images will never
be seen at all if they take forever to download.
Slicing images is a great tool for improving the download speed
of your Web pages. Instead of loading up your page with huge
pictures that download slowly, you can slice up your images
into byte-sized pieces optimized for speed, appearance, and
special functions such as links. Photoshop creates the HTML
(the language used to create Web pages) needed to reconstruct
your images on your page.
This chapter introduces you to the Slice tool found in
Photoshop. ImageReady has a similar tool and expanded slicing
capabilities, but Photoshop’s built-in slicer-dicer has more than
enough versatility to get you started.
Why Slice?
Although speedy broadband connections are becoming more
common, a huge number of Internet cruisers are still using dial-
up connections with top speeds of 56 Kbps or slower. For these
users, nothing is more painful than clicking a link and watching
a blank page laboriously download a few pixels at a time. When
confronted with a page like this, users are likely to click their
Back buttons and move on.
Your solutions, as Webmaster, fall into several categories:

Use images with very small dimensions. Buttons and
graphic rules download quickly. However, they are usu-
ally ornamental or functional rather than centerpieces of
your page design.

Select the best format for your image. Choosing the JPEG or GIF format when appropri-
ate can make a significant difference in how quickly your image downloads. You find out
about these formats and how to make this determination in Book IX, Chapter 1.

Optimize the heck out of the image. One image in a particular format can be five or ten
times as large as the same image in the same format, depending on how you’ve opti-
mized it. You find out how to optimize your images in Book IX, Chapter 2.

Slice your image into pieces. Individually optimize each piece for its intended purpose:
appearance, download speed, or a combination of the two. With a little care, you can
take a complicated image and divide it into slices that look as good or better than the
original. Slices also enable you to easily apply Web features such as rollovers.
Another point to keep in mind is that visitors will be using different screen resolutions. If
you’re happily cruising the Internet at 1024 x 768 resolution, that doesn’t mean you should
include really large images on your pages (even if sliced and optimized). Other users with the
same screen resolution you use may have set their browser windows to a smaller size or may
be using displays with a maximum of 800 x 600 pixels or smaller. The ability to slice images
doesn’t mean you can fill your screen with gigantic graphics.
Slices also let you treat different parts of an image in different ways, associating some with
Web links to other images or pages, just as you can do with image maps. (Book IX, Chapter 5,
briefly discusses image maps.)
Design your Web pages to fit your audience. If your site is geared toward the masses, make
the pages a maximum of 800 x 600 pixels. If it is aimed at a specialized high-end audience,
then you can go as large as 1024 x 768 pixels.
Slicing Up Images
You can create slices from many different kinds of images. Figure 3-1 shows a fanciful fictitious
Web page, but with the kinds of images you might want to slice.
For example, you might be interested in slicing the menu of choices on the left side of the
figure so that you can include links to the individual pages referenced. The lower image of the
four foreign lands offers even more motivation for slicing. It’s fairly huge and would load much
more quickly if you sliced it up into four sections. Each slice is also a candidate for a link that
would take visitors to a page devoted to that particular country.
Types of slices
Photoshop enables you to create several different types of slices:

User slices: You create these slices by defining areas of the image.

Layer slices: Photoshop creates these slices from layers of an image.

Auto slices: Photoshop creates these slices automatically to account for the rest of the
image when you’ve sliced a bit out of it.
You find out more about the differences between these kinds of slices throughout the rest of
this chapter.

Creating slices
To slice up an image into user slices, just follow these steps:
Figure 3-1
Book
IX
Chapter
3
1.
Select the Slice tool from the Tools
palette.
Or press K to activate it.
When you select the Slice tool, an indi-
cator graphic appears in the upper-left
corner of the image, marking the whole
image as Slice 01, even before you’ve
selected a new slice.
2.
Drag with the Slice tool to select the
part of the image you want to slice.
For example, select the entire Japan
area in the lower edge.
A solid slice selection box appears
around the new slice, with handles at
each corner and at the sides, top, and
bottom. Photoshop assigns the slice a
number and icon in its upper-left corner.
3.
Repeat Step 2 to slice the image into as
many individual portions as you want.
For example, continue to select the
other countries to slice the image into
individual portions.
Photoshop assigns each of your user
slices its own slice number and icon, as
shown in Figure 3-2.

Slicing options
The steps in the preceding section show the slicing operation in its simplest form. You do
have some additional options, however, as described in the following list:

Use a fixed size or fixed aspect ratio (proportion). Choose Fixed Size from the Style
pop-up menu in the Options bar and type a width and height in pixels in the Width and
Height boxes. Or choose Fixed Aspect Ratio and type the relative proportions you want
to use (that is, 1:2, 3:4, and so forth) in the Width and Height boxes. Photoshop con-
strains the Slice tool to the size or proportions you specify.
You might want to use Fixed Size to create equal-sized slices in an image, especially an
image composed of similar-sized elements, and Fixed Aspect Ratio to create slices that
have similar proportions.
If you’ve already created a slice that’s the right size to apply to another portion of your
image, you can duplicate the slice by dragging the slice while holding down the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac). Drag the new slice to the location where you want to apply it.

Create a square slice. Hold down the Shift key as you drag a slice’s boundaries to
create a slice in a perfect square when the Slice or Slice Selection tool is active.

Create guides. If your slices will make up a grid of horizontal and vertical lines, you can
create guides that mark their boundaries. Click the Slices from Guides button in the
Options bar to automatically slice the image by using these guides.

Put each slice in its own layer. You can put each portion of the image you want to
define as a slice in its own layer. Then just select the layer and choose Layer➪New
Layer Based Slice. This is how you create a rollover state (an action taken on a Web page
when the mouse passes over, clicks on, or leaves a defined area). You can find more
information on rollovers in Book IX, Chapter 5.
Auto slices are slices Photoshop creates to account for the area that you haven’t defined as a
user slice or layer slice. They’re shown on-screen as dotted lines to differentiate them from
the solid lines that define user slices and layer slices. Auto slices also have gray slice numbers
and icons, as opposed to the blue numbers and icons used to represent their nonautomatic
siblings. If you want to change an auto slice to a user slice (say, it encompasses an area you
were going to slice anyway), select the slice and choose Promote to User Slice from the
Options bar.
Figure 3-2

Selecting and Modifying Slices
679
Selecting and Modifying Slices
The number assigned to each slice is dynamic, starting with the slice at the top-left corner of
the image, and going from left to right and top to bottom. As you rearrange slices, Photoshop
updates the numbers. Each slice also receives an icon that reflects its type, as shown in Figure
3-3. You can have user slices with and without content, layer slices, slices that contain
rollovers, and slices that have links associated with them.
Showing/hiding slices and slice numbers
You can show or hide slices and show or hide the slice numbers:

Show or hide slices: Choose View➪Show➪Slices.

Show or hide slice numbers: Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Grid, Guides, & Slices (or
Photoshop➪Preferences➪Grid, Guides, & Slices with Mac OS X) and select or deselect
the Show Slice Numbers option.
Changing the color of the lines
To change the color used to represent slices, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Grid, Guides, & Slices
(or Photoshop➪Preferences➪Grid, Guides, & Slices with Mac OS X) and select a color from
the Line Color pop-up menu under Slices.
Selecting slices
To make any changes to a slice, you must first select it. You can select a slice by clicking any
visible portion of the slice with the Slice Select tool. Here are a few tips for using this tool:

Switch from the Slice tool to the Slice Select tool: Hold down the Shift key and press K
when the Slice tool is active. The Slice Select tool becomes the default tool.

Alternate between the Slice tool and the Slice Select tool: Hold down the Ctrl key (Ô
key on the Mac) to temporarily activate the other tool. For example, if you’re busy slic-
ing images and want to quickly select a slice, hold down the Ctrl (or Ô) key and click
the slice you want to select. When you release the key, the Slice tool becomes the
default tool again.

To remove a slice, select the slice and press the Delete or Backspace key (Delete on the Mac).
To remove all slices from an image and start over, choose View➪Clear Slices. To protect
slices from accidental modifications, choose View➪Lock Slices.
Resizing and moving slices
You can easily resize a user slice or move it to a new location. If you want to resize or move a
layer slice, first select it, and then click the Promote to User Slice button in the Options bar to
change it into a user slice.

Move a user slice: Select the slice and position the cursor inside the slice’s borders.
Then drag to its new position. To help keep slices aligned evenly, you can hold down
the Shift key to restrict movement horizontally, vertically, or to 45-degree angles.

Place a slice at specific coordinates in your image: Click the Slice Options button on
the Options bar or use the Slice Select tool to double-click inside the slice you want to
position. The Slice Options dialog box, as it appears with an image slice, is shown in
Figure 3-4. In the X box, type the number of pixels you want between the left side of the
slice and the left border of the image. In the Y box, type the number of pixels you want
between the top edge of the slice and the top border of the image.

Resize a user slice in any direction: Grab one of the corner or side handles of a
selected slice and drag.

Use pixel dimensions to resize a user slice: Use the Slice Select tool to double-click
inside the slice you want to resize. Then type the width and height, in pixels, in the W
and H boxes.
To simplify positioning slices, choose View➪Snap To and select Guides and/or Slices to tell
Photoshop you want to snap slices to guides or other slices. Then choose View➪Snap to turn
on the snapping feature.

Duplicate a slice: Select the slice with the Slice Select tool and then Alt+drag
(Option+drag on the Mac).

Dividing a slice
You can further divide a slice you’ve made by following these steps:
Book
IX
Chapter

1.
Using the Slice Select tool, select the
user slice or auto slice you want to
divide.
2.
Select the Divide Slice check box in
the Options bar.
The Divide Slice dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-5.
c Select the appropriate check box(es)
to divide the slice horizontally, verti-
cally, or both.
4.
Enter a number in the Slices Down,
Evenly Spaced or the Slices Across,
Evenly Spaced text boxes to split up
your slice into that number of equal
slices. Alternatively, specify a size per
slice in the Pixels per Slice box.
e Select the Preview option if you want
to view the new slices in the docu-
ment window.
6.
Click OK to divide the slice.
Stacking slices
Slices can overlap, but the top slice in a stack of overlapping slices defines the area allocated
to them. You can usually resize slices so that they closely fit the areas you want to define, but
overlapping allows you to create custom-shaped slices. You might want to change the stack-
ing order of slices so that the slice encompasses the exact area you want to define.
To do so, select the slice you want to reorder. Then in the Options bar, shown in Figure 3-6,
click one of the following icons (left to right):

Bring to Front to move the selected slice to the top of the stack

Bring Forward to move the selected slice up one layer in the stack

Send Backward to move the selected slice down one layer in the stack

Send to Back to move the selected slice to the bottom of the stack

Setting Slice Options
Okay, here’s the part you’ve been waiting for: What do you do with these slices, anyway? In
the Slice Options dialog box (discussed briefly earlier in this chapter), you can control how a
Web browser uses the slices.
You can set or view the options for any slice by double-clicking the slice with the Slice Select
tool or by clicking the Slice Options button in the Options bar. Either command opens the Slice
Options dialog box, shown in Figure 3-7. Here are the parameters you can set in this dialog box:

Slice Type: You can choose Image (the usual choice) or No Image. Select No Image if
you have a slice that contains only a solid background color or text because a nonimage
slice downloads very quickly. If the slice is part of a larger image and contains no actual
image content, you can speed up the download of that portion considerably.
If you choose No Image, the Slice Options dialog box changes, providing space for you to
enter the HTML tags or text you want to appear in the slice, as shown in Figure 3-8.

Name: In this text box, you can enter a custom name for your image slice (unless you
chose No Image as the Slice Type), usually based on its content. You can name slices
automatically by using the Slice Output Options, described in the next section.

URL: If you enter a Web address in this text box, clicking anywhere in the slice links to
this address. The slice behaves like a defined portion of an image map. (See Book IX,
Chapter 5 for more on image maps.)

Target: Briefly, the target is the default frame (if your Web page has frames) that will be
accessed in the URL you specified in the URL text box. Describing how to write HTML
tags (the language used by Web browsers) is beyond the scope of this book, but if
you’re interested in more information, check out HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th Edition, by
Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Figure 3-7
Figure 3-6

Saving Your Slices
683

Message Text: In this text box, type a message you’d like to appear in the browser’s
status bar when the mouse passes over the slice. If you enter nothing, the URL is dis-
played.

Alt Tag: This is important text that’s too often neglected. Alt text appears in nongraphi-
cal browsers (that is, browsers that show only text and not images) and also pops up as
sort of a ToolTip when the mouse passes over the slice. Many people still use non-
graphical browsers, particularly users who are visually impaired and rely on text-to-
speech software to translate Web pages to sound. Alt text allows these folks to “see” a
description of your image and serves as a handy explanation for users who have graphi-
cal browsers. The Alt text also shows up if users suffer a lengthy wait while images
download.

Dimensions: These text boxes show the width and height of the slice and its coordinate
location in the image. You generally won’t want to change these settings at this time.

Slice Background Type: Choose a color for the transparent portion of an image slice
(for example, when you’re using a transparent GIF) or the full area of a No Image slice.
Your choices include None, Matte, Black, White, or Other. Click the Background Color
patch to select a specific hue.
Saving Your Slices
After you’ve defined your slices and set all the options, you can save your image with its
slices. Use the Save for Web feature (discussed in Book IX, Chapter 2) to optimize your slices.
Photoshop then lets you 

Choose the best parameters for each slice. For example, you can save a slice containing
line graphics or graphical text as a GIF, or a slice containing many colors as a JPEG.

Optimize each slice for appearance and download speed.
Photoshop also saves the HTML code needed to display your slices and link them to the URLs
you specified.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Creating a Splash Page Mockup
Many designers conceptualize and mock
up their Web pages in Photoshop before
they compile the components in an HTML
editor such as GoLive, Dreamweaver, or
FrontPage.
If you plan on really getting into
preparing graphics for Web design pur-
poses, I highly recommend getting a
book solely devoted to the topic,
where you’ll find tons of great tips tar-
geting your specific needs.
Although the exact steps for designing and
mocking up a Web page vary widely accord-
ing to the style and nature of the page, this
example at least gives you some idea of the
process. For example, you might want to
create a logo, button, or other standard ele-
ment that appears on your page, identifying
it as yours and yours alone.
Follow these steps to create a splash page
with great images, buttons, and logos:
1.
Open all the images you want to
use in the page.
For example, you can create a splash
page (also called a home page in
some circles) for a pseudo company
called adventuretrekker.com. 
Before you sit down in front of the
computer, have an idea of what you
are going to create. I always do
some rough sketches of any page I
design. That way, I’m not staring at
the monitor waiting for my page to
magically take form.
For the lowdown on prepping your
images for the Web, check out Book
IX, Chapter 1.
Rather than give you a million cross-
references in this exercise, let me just
provide a blanket caveat that lots of
techniques, such as selecting, masking,
blending, applying effects, and using
layers, are covered in detail elsewhere
in the book.
2.
Choose File➪New to create the
canvas you will use to composite
your Web page.
The New dialog box appears.
c Specify your dimensions, mode, res-
olution, and background contents.
3

Creating a Splash Page Mockup
685
Book
IX
Chapter

The mode should always be RGB.
You can set your background con-
tents to any color or to transparent.
The resolution is really irrelevant
because it’s the pixel dimensions
that count for on-screen viewing.
However, people often use 72 ppi
(pixels/inch) to make it easy.
The dimensions depend on the
demographics of your audience. If
you want to design a page that
anyone in the world can view, even
those in less-developed countries
who are still cruising on old 486 PCs,
you may want to stick with 640 x 480
pixels. The page can be even smaller
if you want to take into account the
browser menu bar and controls. If
you’re designing for the middle of
the road, 800 x 600 pixels may be
the ticket, again a little less to
account for the browser controls. If
your audience is made up of sophis-
ticated and high-end users only, you
can get away with 1024 x 768 pixels.
I’m sticking with 800 x 600, 72 ppi,
and white contents for my splash
page. You can also give your file a
name in the Name text box.
You don’t have to create a new blank
canvas to composite your multiple
images. Instead, you can use an image
as your canvas and drag your support-
ing images onto it. Just be sure that
the base image is the correct mode
and dimensions.
d Make your first selection. Then
with the Move tool, drag and drop
the image onto your blank canvas.

For my page, I’m using the image on
which I created a snowstorm in
Book VII, Chapter 2. I made a rectan-
gular selection with the Rectangular
Marquee tool and dragged the image
onto my white canvas. I left an open
area at the top where my navigation
bar will go.
Be sure to name all your layers
(double-click the name in the Layers
palette). Creating a splash page can
require a lot of layers, so layer manage-
ment is essential.
e Make your second selection and
again drag and drop the image
onto your splash page.
For my page, I am using an image of
a polar bear sticking his head out of
a hole in the ice.
f Apply any layer masks you need
for your images to blend in with
the canvas or the other images.
Click the Add Layer Mask icon at the
bottom of the Layers palette. Use
the painting tools to create your
desired mask.
My polar bear doesn’t quite look like
he actually is part of the snowy
landscape background, so I applied
a layer mask and blended him in
accordingly. I then used the Brush
tool, with a feathered tip, set to
Airbrush mode with a Flow Rate of
10%, to paint around the edges of
my polar bear. I also added a layer
mask on my snow layer because I
wanted to mask out some of the
snow over my polar bear so that he
would stand out a little better.

g If you have prepared a logo, drag it
onto the splash page.
If you’re using a vector art logo, such
as one created in Illustrator, just
choose File➪Open. Specify your ras-
terization settings. If the logo is at
least 100% of its intended size, ras-
terize it as RGB, 72 ppi, and leave the
dimensions at the default setting.
8.
Create the type and/or buttons for
your navigation bar.
I’m not a big fan of buttons unless
they are simple and understated. I
prefer to use type only for my navi-
gation bars. But hey, it’s a free
world; if you like buttons, go for it. 
Be sure that your type looks legible on-
screen. Check out Book IX, Chapter 1,
for tips on making your type look its
best on-screen. I used the font Verdana
for both my logo and navigation bar,
using 24 points and 12 points, respec-
tively. I set my anti-aliasing to Crisp.
You can create buttons quickly and
easily in Photoshop. Using the
Marquee or Shape tools, draw a shape
such as a rectangle, an ellipse, or even
a custom shape on a separate layer.
Open the Styles palette and, with that
layer active, simply click a preset style.
Several preset libraries are dedicated to
buttons. You’ll find them at the bottom
of the palette options menu.
i Apply any layer effects or styles to
your images or type.
I kept it simple and just applied a
drop shadow and inner bevel to my
logo type and a drop shadow to my
logo. Be sure to keep Use Global
Light selected so that your light
source for effects is consistent
among all your elements.

j Add title text to your page and
apply any layer effects or styles
desired.
I added my title type in the font
Impact by using two sizes. Because
my type overlapped and was offset, I
put it on two different layers. I then
applied layer effects — drop
shadow, inner glow, and inner bevel.
Of course, you can do this step con-
currently with Steps 7 and 8, if you
want. Then again, you can do any of
the steps in whatever order you
desire. There are no hard and fast
rules, so just let your creative juices
take over.
k If you want to, you can now slice
your image into chunks, which you
can optimize separately.
Although not mandatory, sometimes
slicing your image can help your
viewers to perceive that a page is
downloading more quickly. 
A Web page with slices loads as
pieces, so users can get glimpses of
the graphics and don’t have to wait
for the entire page to load at once.
Slicing also allows you to take
chunks of your page and apply sepa-
rate optimization settings to them in
the Save for Web dialog box.
l Use the Save for Web dialog box to
compress the slices at different
rates according to the quality
needed.
You can also apply image maps and
rollovers to slices in ImageReady. If
it makes more sense to apply your
slices to individual layers, rather
than the image as a whole, you can
do that as well.
To preview how your image would
look in a browser without HTML-
coding it, save a copy in the JPEG file
format. Launch your browser and
choose File➪Open. Your image
appears in the browser window.

B
y now, you may be so proud of your Photoshop artistry
that you want to show it off to the world on a Web page.
Photoshop has a crafty Web page construction tool built
right in, so even if you don’t know anything about HTML —
except that it’s an acronym you hear a lot — you can create a
Web-based display page for your images with very little trouble.
All you need to do is show Photoshop the location of the
images you want to include on your Web page, select a style,
enter a little information, and sit back and watch while your
favorite image editor does the rest. Of course, you still need to
upload the resulting Web page and images to a hosting service
on the Internet and tell all your friends and colleagues where to
find it. But that’s not too difficult.
If you want to know more about creating Web pages and post-
ing them for anyone and everyone with a browser to see, check
out Creating Web Pages All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies,
by Emily A. Vander Veer (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
A Web gallery is a Web page that includes small thumb-
nails — miniature versions of your main images — and links
that enable visitors to view those images in a larger size.
But using thumbnails isn’t your only option. The gallery can
also showcase one image at a time in large form and
change the view at intervals, just like a slide show.
Planning Your Page
Creating a gallery requires using the Web Photo Gallery dialog
box, which isn’t all that tough to use — after you know what
your choices are. Here’s a rundown:
Creating a Web
Photo Gallery

In This Chapter
 Planning your page
 Cooking up a Web gallery

Book IX  Chapter 4: Creating a Web Photo Gallery


Styles: Your options include a variety of horizontal and vertical layouts in several differ-
ent color schemes with other options. The thumbnail image gives you an idea of the
look of the gallery style. 
Photoshop CS has revamped the style templates for Web galleries. The new feedback styles
(see an example of one in Figure 4-1) are outstanding. Post your images or projects on the
Web in a gallery format and your recipients can actually enter and save comments. They can
also click the E-Mail Feedback button, which automatically launches their e-mail client and
composes a message containing the feedback comments. Just be aware that putting an
e-mail link on a Web page potentially can invite spam. So be sure and have your e-mail
client’s spam filter on full bore if you plan on using the E-Mail Feedback feature.

Source Images: Choosing your source images is as simple as remembering what folder
and where you saved the files you want to share online. You also choose the folder
where you would like your Web photo gallery files saved after they are processed. Or
you can select multiple files in the File Browser, and then choose Selected Images from
File Browser from the Use pop-up menu.

Options: Your choices in the pop-up menu run the gamut (and each pop-up menu selec-
tion comes with its own set of options). Here’s a quick rundown of what you’ll find:
 General: From the Extension drop-down list, choose either .htm or .html as the file
extension for your Web page. 
Figure 4-1

Planning Your Page
693
The Web server that hosts your page may be fussy about the extension you choose for your
Web page. Servers running Windows-based software may insist that pages have an .htm
extension. Those running under Unix or a similar operating system may prefer .html. Most
of the time, the server software doesn’t care, and .htm does just fine.
Select Use UTF 8 Encoding for URL if you want that type of encoding. UTF-8 encod-
ing allows for Unicode to be used on platforms designed around ASCII code, such as
Unix and Linux.
Select Add Width and Height Attributes if you want that data for images displayed
on the Web page. 
Select Preserve All Metadata to maintain metadata info (see Book I, Chapter 5 for
more on metadata).
 Banner: The banner displays certain information about your page. Enter a name for
your site, the name of the photographer, contact information, the date, and the font
style and type for the banner.
 Large Images: With this option, you’re able to control how the full-size images
appear when displayed. You can have them displayed in their normal size or resize
them to small, medium, large, or custom-specified pixel widths. For Constrain,
choose which dimension of the image you want to constrain during resizing. You can
even specify JPEG compression/quality, add a border, and show or hide the filename,
description, credits, title, or copyright information. You can also specify the font and
font size.
You must enter the information for captions, credit, title, copyrights, and so forth for each
image separately by choosing File➪File Info. In the File Info dialog box that appears, you’ll
find boxes to enter all this information. You can also enter this data in the Metadata portion
of the File Browser. Photoshop then saves that information with the image file and uses it
with the Web Photo Gallery tool and some other specialized functions.
 Thumbnails: This option enables you to control the size of the thumbnails, the
number of rows and columns used to display them, and the size of any border you
want to put around the thumbnails. You can also assign what informational element
you want in the title of each thumbnail. Choose from the filename, description, cred-
its, title, and copyright information you’ve entered. Note: You can’t set rows and
columns if you select the Centered Frame, Horizontal, or Simple style.
 Custom Colors: Using this option, you can select colors for the background, the text
that describes the images, and any links displayed in the background, as well as the
color of the banner, the active links in the banner, and any links in the banner that
your visitor has clicked.
 Security: This option lets you specify any copyright and security notices that you
want displayed with your images. Specify font attributes and alignment for any copy-
right and security text.

Cooking Up a Web Gallery
The advantage of displaying your images in a Web gallery (compared to simply constructing
one humongous page that shows all the images at their full file size) is that viewers with
slower Internet connections don’t have to wait for all the images to download. Even visitors
with fast Internet connections will appreciate not being inundated with a flood of images.
To create your Web gallery, follow these steps:
1.
Collect the images you want to dis-
play in a single folder on your hard
drive.
You may want to deposit copies of
your images, leaving the originals
untouched.

Open the first image in Photoshop

f From the Styles drop-down list,
choose one of the standard styles,
such as Horizontal Slide Show (which
arranges the images as a slide show)
or Centered Frame (which arrays
them in a vertical format).
A preview of the Web Gallery style you
select is shown in the window on the
right side of the dialog box. Some
styles show thumbnail previews of
your images, which visitors can click to
view the larger originals. Or you can
select a slide-show style that cycles
through the available images at inter-
vals. See the earlier section, “Planning

A
dobe ImageReady is a stand-alone program bundled with
Photoshop that serves as your one-stop-shopping source
for a variety of Web-based tricks, such as image maps
(which let you link portions of an image to a Web address),
rollovers (which tell your browser to do certain things when
the mouse cursor passes over a portion of the Web page), and
animations (those often annoying rotating logos and dancing
bunnies that you see on some Web pages).
You can even combine two or more of these effects. For example,
you can create an image with separate areas that change their
appearance when the mouse cursor passes over or clicks them.
This change can be an animated glowing effect that vanishes
when the visitor clicks to jump to a new page on your Web site.
The programs overlap in many ways with many functions you
can carry out in both. Photoshop has more features related to
creating and editing content, whereas ImageReady has more
extensive options for optimizing and configuring images for the
Web. And like Photoshop CS, ImageReady CS got a slew of
enhancements in this new version as well. But, if your Web
needs are modest, you can probably do all you need within
Photoshop itself and may rarely need to call on ImageReady.
This chapter provides an overview of what you can do in
ImageReady rather than step-by-step instructions for each of
the functions, so you can decide when you’re ready for
ImageReady, so to speak.
Firing Up ImageReady
Adobe provides an easy link between Photoshop and
ImageReady. If you’re working on an image in Photoshop
and want to create one of the ImageReady effects, just choose

File➪Edit in ImageReady, or press Shift+Ctrl+M (Shift+Ô+M on the Mac). You can also choose
this command from the File menu in the Photoshop File Browser. Or simply click the Edit in
ImageReady button at the bottom of the Tools palette. And finally, if you are in the Save for
Web dialog box, you’ll also find an Edit in ImageReady button. ImageReady then opens with
the same image. When you’re finished in ImageReady, you can jump back to Photoshop by
using the same menu choice or shortcut keystrokes; Photoshop displays an updated version
of the image file, so any changes you’ve made in ImageReady are reflected in Photoshop.
In previous versions, when you were manipulating an image in ImageReady, the image was
dark in Photoshop to indicate that the file was inactive. Adobe has eliminated this duplication
of images in favor of speed and efficiency. You no longer see the image in the companion pro-
gram. But to reactivate the image in either program, choose Window and select the filename
at the bottom of the menu. And remember that files updated in one application can be auto-
updated in the other. Just make sure that you’ve selected Auto-Update Open Documents
option in your General Preferences. 
If you used previous versions of ImageReady, you’ll find that the interface got a makeover in
this new version. The interface is more object-oriented, allowing you to more easily select,
align, and group objects and layers. Adobe also added Smart Guides, similar to those found
in Illustrator, to enable more precision in object placement. This user interface enhancement
should allow for easier Web page construction, especially if your page contains lots of but-
tons and shapes.
Mapping Your Images
Image maps associate certain areas of an image with a Web address, or URL, so that when the
user clicks those areas, the browser loads the image or Web page that the URL points to.
These linked image areas act much like image slices, which you can prepare in Photoshop
itself (see Book IX, Chapter 3). The main difference between image maps and slices is that
slices are always rectangular in shape, whereas areas in image maps can be virtually any
shape, even irregular polygons.
The easiest way to create an image map is with the Image Map tool, available in ImageReady’s
Tools palette or by pressing P. There are three variations of the tool: Rectangle, Circle, and
Polygon. You use the tools in much the same way as the rectangular, elliptical, and polygonal
lasso selection tools: Drag to create an image-map selection in the desired shape. After you
create an area, selection handles appear at each of the corners and sides (in the case of rec-
tangular and circular areas) or at each of the defining points for a polygonal area, as shown in
Figure 5-1. You can drag these handles to resize and reshape the area.
Each of the map selections you choose is given a generic name, which you can change to
something more descriptive in the Image Map palette. You also need to enter the following
information:

The URL that the browser should jump to when that area of the image is clicked.

The Target area in the destination page (such as the top of the page or another location
you define).

Mapping Your Images


The alternate text that should appear when the mouse cursor passes over that area of
the image map. The Alt text helps the visitor understand what a particular area of the
image map represents. For example, if you’re creating an image map from a map of the
United States, you might use the name of each state as alternate text for that state’s
image-map area. This can be an aid to people with vision problems who are using a
screen reader to navigate your site.
When you create an image-map area, the dimensions of the area appear at the bottom of the
Image Map palette.
You can also create image maps from layers. Select the areas you want to transform into
image-map areas and copy and paste them into their own layers. Then choose Layer➪New
Layer Based on Image Map Area. ImageReady creates an area from each layer’s contents.
This is often a better choice when you want to add a rollover effect to an area because the
image-map area automatically adjusts to any changes in the area produced by the rollover
effect (such as a glow).

After you’ve defined your image-map areas, ImageReady creates and stores an HTML file you
can use with your Web-authoring software to activate the image maps on your pages.

Rolling Over
A rollover is an effect on a Web page that causes an image to change appearance when the
mouse performs some action, such as passing over or clicking the image. For example, an
image might reverse to show its negative version, pulsate with an eerie glow, or change
appearance entirely (for example, a button’s text might change from OFF to ON when clicked).
Rollovers are an excellent way to provide interactivity on a Web page. To create a rollover, you
need to decide what you want your image to do in response to a particular mouse action. You
then simply create versions of the image in the different states and have ImageReady provide the
JavaScript instructions that tell the Web browser to switch between them at the appropriate
time.
The Rollovers palette is no more. The new Web Content palette has replaced it, letting you
create and specify options for your rollovers. The new palette also displays slices, image
maps, and animation frames.
You can create a rollover effect in ImageReady by following these steps:
1.
Open an image to be used with a par-
ticular rollover effect.
b Define the area you want to use for
the rollover by creating a layer-based
slice or an image map, as I have in
Figure 5-2.
3.
In the Web Content palette, choose
New Rollover State from the palette
pop-up menu (access the menu by
clicking the triangle in the upper
right of the palette).
The rollover specifies what mouse
action activates that particular state or
appearance. For example, the default is
Over (the mouse cursor passes over
the image). But you can select different
rollovers such as Down (the visitor
presses the mouse button down), Up
(the visitor releases the mouse
button), Click (the visitor clicks the
area with the mouse), Out (the visitor
takes the mouse cursor away from the
image area), and so on.
d In the Web Content palette, select the
state and edit the content for the state
to create the rollover effect.
You want to create the different state,
or appearance, that will appear when
the mouse action activates the rollover.
For example, if you want a button to
flip between OFF and ON, you need to
have two states (on separate layers),
one for the normal, ON state and one
for the OFF state. In my example, a
glow appears when my mouse cursor
moves over the text.
5.
Click the Preview button (a pointing
finger with an small starburst) in the
Tools palette to view your rollover.
ImageReady creates JavaScript instruc-
tions for you that you can incorporate
into your Web pages to use these
rollover effects with your images.

Getting Animated
701
Book
IX
Chapter
5
Getting Animated
ImageReady can also take your multilayered images and create animated GIF files that provide
motion effects when displayed on your Web pages. Although animations are often poorly used
and overused, motion can be effective if you don’t overdo it. One or two (max) objects that,
say, call attention to a special area of a page or a helpful link might be okay if well done. And
keep in mind that some browsers allow the user to disable animations, so using animations
for something critical may not be a good idea. You might even find other applications for ani-
mations, such as within PowerPoint presentations. ImageReady has all the tools you need to
create these animations and can even streamline the job for you.
Animations are nothing more than successive images, or frames, that are displayed one after
another to create the illusion of motion. For example, you might have an image in which an
object moves from left to right, one tiny increment at a time. Or you might have four views of
an object, each from a different angle, which, when viewed consecutively, produce the illusion
2

of rotation. The GIF format enables you to store each version in a separate layer within the GIF
file. A Web browser (or other program, such as PowerPoint) that displays the GIF file automat-
ically shows each of the different image layers in turn. All you need to do to create an ani-
mated GIF is to produce the individual layers and find a way to combine them into a GIF file.
That’s where ImageReady comes in.
You can save animations in ImageReady as animated GIFs, a QuickTime movie, or as SWF
(Macromedia Flash) files. And in this latest version of ImageReady, you can also save anima-
tion frames out as separate files.
Here are some of the ways ImageReady can help you create animations:

Build animations from layers. Create each of the individual frames needed for an ani-
mation in a separate layer in Photoshop (or ImageReady). Then open the image in
ImageReady and choose Create from Layers from the Animation palette. ImageReady
will create a set of frames that you can edit, change the order of, and then save as an
animated GIF, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Create tweened images for you. If you want to move an object in your image from Point
A to Point B, you don’t need to create each layer manually. You can specify the frames
that show the start and end positions of your object and ask ImageReady to create new,
intermediate frames.
The term tweening comes from the process used to automatically create and insert the
frames “in between” the start and ending frames.

Specify the time interval between frames. ImageReady can add a Delay value between
two or more frames, determining how long to show each frame before displaying the

next. Shorter display times and faster frame rates produce smoother animations, but
also dramatically increase the size of your animated GIF. You can play around with time
intervals in ImageReady until you get the best compromise.

Optimize animations. ImageReady can squeeze your animated GIFs down to a manage-
able size by discarding pixels that don’t change from frame to frame, leaving you with
only the pixels required to generate the animated effect you want.
Working with Layers
When working in ImageReady, you can rest assured that you won’t have to give up the flexibil-
ity of working with the layers. ImageReady also sports a Layers palette, shown in Figure 5-4,
and works the same way, but has a couple of additional features to help you with your Web
page construction. Here’s a brief rundown on those additions:

You can select multiple layers (contiguous or not, it doesn’t matter), either in the
Layers palette or right in the document. Those selected layers can then be grouped,
aligned, moved, transformed, and so on.

ImageReady has a supercharged Move tool that lets you select, align, and move multiple
layers. When you select the Move tool, you have three options. The Layer Move tool
moves the entire layer. The Layer Select tool moves an ungrouped or grouped layer as a
single element. And the Direct Select tool selects a specific layer(s) in a group to move
independently.

When you select a layer, you get selection handles around the content so you can easily
distinguish what is selected in the file.

You can group layers, allowing you to quickly move or transform multiple layers
together as a single element. You can think of grouping as a great combo of Layer sets
and linking layers.
Figure 5-4


You can unify layers. The Unify buttons in the Layers palette specify how the changes
you make to a layer for an active rollover state or animation frame apply to the states or
frames. When you click a Unify button, the changes apply to all states and frames.
Otherwise, the changes apply only to the active state or frame.

You can export some or all of your layers or layer sets. File formats you export to
include Photoshop, GIF, JPEG, PNG, WBMP, and SWF. What is really nice is that you can
even assign different file formats to individual layers. They do not all have to be the
same format. You can also apply different optimization settings to the individual layers.
Although you’ll find slices in both Photoshop and ImageReady, ImageReady provides
enhanced options for creating and working with slices. For example, you can create multiple
slide sets per document. You can also cut, copy, and paste slices using commands on the Edit
menu. So if slicing in Photoshop isn’t quite cutting it, turn to ImageReady.
Using Tables
In ImageReady, you can group your slices into a table, shown in Figure 5-5, for conversion to
HTML. By using tables, you can ensure that your original sliced image will appear consistently
and properly composed in the Web browser. Tables are also useful for creating designs that
you want to flex (or change size) in a browser window. To create a table, simply select your
slices, and then click the Group Slice into Table icon (a divided square) in the Web Content
palette. Or choose Slices➪Group Slices into Table.

P
hotoshop is an application with such breadth and depth
that you may never find a need to integrate your images
with any other application. But just in case you need to,
you’ll be happy to know that working between Photoshop and
other programs is easier than ever, especially if you’re working
within the latest versions of Adobe’s companion programs. I
obviously can’t cover every program you may want to partner
with Photoshop, but I’ll hit a few of them. You’ll find that simi-
lar types of programs also share similarities in the kinds of
Photoshop files they will accept and so on. So if I don’t cover
the specific program you have in mind, read up on one that’s
similar. It may give you the information that you need. But if all
else fails, you may have to break open the dreaded application
user manual.
Illustrator
Illustrator, Adobe’s vector graphics drawing program, is proba-
bly the friendliest program to work with Photoshop. Maybe it’s
natural that a drawing program and an image-editing/painting
program go hand in hand. Or it may be because the two appli-
cations share a lot of common elements — paths, filters, layers,
colors, and so on. Whatever the reason, feel free to move files
between Photoshop and Illustrator. Layers, masks, trans-
parency, and shapes are all preserved.
Why would you want to bring your images into Illustrator when
Photoshop now has vector capabilities? Well, even though
Photoshop can now create vector shapes and type, it’s still an
image editor at heart and doesn’t quite have the same drawing
capabilities of Illustrator. Illustrator is superior when it comes
to creating complex, compound paths and handling large
chunks of text here and there. For example, say you want to
create a large poster that includes photographs and vector
graphics and type. The best course of action is to prepare your

photos in Photoshop and save them as EPS or TIFF files. Then you open a new file in
Illustrator by using your poster’s dimensions. Place your photos in the Illustrator file, add
your vector graphics and type, and save your file as a native Illustrator or Illustrator EPS file.
Illustrator accepts TIFF, EPS, PSD, PDF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, FLM, PCX, and PICT files from
Photoshop.

Moving images into Illustrator
Photoshop lets you drag and drop images directly into Illustrator. You can also choose
File➪Open in Illustrator to bring in a Photoshop file. Choosing this command creates a new
Illustrator file with the same name as the Photoshop file and also automatically embeds the file.
If you’re importing ImageReady files, any image maps, slices, rollovers, and animations are
preserved when you import the files into Illustrator.
But the best way to move images into Illustrator is to follow these steps:
1.
Save the Photoshop file you want to
move into Illustrator.
2.
In Illustrator, choose File➪Place to
import the file. Be sure to deselect the
Link option in the Place dialog box.
If you select the Link option, Illustrator
brings your Photoshop file in as a link.
This means that it will refer to the exter-
nal Photoshop file where it resides on
the hard drive or media and not embed
the image data within the Illustrator file.
The Photoshop Import dialog box
(shown in Figure 1-1) appears.
c Select an option for how you want to
deal with Photoshop’s layers (if you
have any).
You can choose to convert Photoshop
layers to objects, which will maintain
all the Photoshop layers, along with
their associated transparency. Or you
can flatten Photoshop layers to a single
image, which merges all the layers but
leaves any remaining open areas trans-
parent after the merge.
Any type layers or layer styles are ras-
terized into pixels and become uned-
itable. Any layer masks are converted
into Illustrator’s opacity masks (similar
to layer masks).
Your Photoshop image is now embed-
ded in the Illustrator file.

Figure 1-1

InDesign

Copying and pasting
You can use the clipboard to copy and paste between Photoshop and Illustrator. In
Photoshop, select your desired image and choose Edit➪Copy. Then in Illustrator, choose
Edit➪Paste.
To go the other way, select and copy your artwork in Illustrator. Then choose Edit➪Paste in
Photoshop. The pasted artwork appears inside a bounding box in your Photoshop image
window. If the artwork is larger than the window, Photoshop resizes the artwork to fit, keeping
the same aspect ratio. You can move the artwork by dragging inside the box or transform the
artwork by dragging the handles of the box. You can also apply anti-aliasing by choosing this
option in the Options bar. To commit the artwork, click the Commit icon (the check icon) in
the Options bar or press Enter (Return on the Mac).
I don’t recommend the clipboard method for large or high-resolution selections. Storing a big
file on your clipboard can eat up precious RAM and slow your computer’s performance. In
addition, if you are copying and pasting between Photoshop and some non-Adobe programs,
your image can potentially suffer degradation. You’re better off saving the images in Photoshop
in a compatible file format and importing the image into the destination application.
Exporting Photoshop paths
You can also export Photoshop paths as Illustrator files. For example, you may have an image
with a clipping path that you want to import into Illustrator in order to combine it with vector
graphics and type. (For more on clipping paths, see Book III, Chapter 2.) Choose File➪
Export➪Paths to Illustrator. Choose a location for the path, give it a name, and click Save.
Open the path in Illustrator as a new file. The path is fully editable in Illustrator.
Placing an Illustrator file into Photoshop
You can place an Adobe Illustrator file into Photoshop, along with a PDF or EPS file, by using
the File➪Place command. When you place a file, Photoshop rasterizes it at the resolution of
the file into which you are placing it. You can’t edit text or vector paths.
As with copying and pasting, described earlier, the placed artwork appears inside a bounding
box in your Photoshop image window. In addition, all the same options in manipulating and
committing the artwork apply here as well.
To maintain consistent color control between Photoshop and Illustrator, and also between
InDesign and Acrobat, be sure to check out the chapter on color, Book II, Chapter 2.
InDesign
InDesign is Adobe’s professional page layout program. You can paste, drag and drop, or place
Photoshop files into InDesign, and it retains any paths, masks, alpha channels, and trans-
parency, depending on your file format. You can even use the Photoshop paths to create
special effects such as text wraps in InDesign.

Photoshop allows you to specify your image width in columns. Using columns is handy when
you plan to import an image into a page layout program like InDesign (or even PageMaker or
QuarkXPress) and you want the image to fit exactly within a certain number of columns,
based on the established grid of your layout page. You can specify columns in the New, Image
Size, and Canvas Size dialog boxes. To set the specific values for the width of the column and
gutter (the space between the columns), go to the Units and Ruler panel of your Preferences
(on the Edit menu in Windows and Photoshop in Mac OS X).
InDesign has a nice feature called Edit Original, which allows you to double-click a linked
image to launch the native application, such as Photoshop. Make your edits and save and
close the file, and it appears edited in your page layout.
InDesign accepts PSD, TIFF, EPS, JPEG, GIF, PCX, BMP, DCS, and PICT file formats. Stick with
TIFF or EPS. If you have layers and transparency, you can also use the native Photoshop
format. For proper color modes and resolution settings for image files to be printed, see
Book II, Chapter 1 (resolution); Book II, Chapter 2 (modes); and Book X, Chapter 2 (prepping
graphics for print).
PageMaker
PageMaker is Adobe’s business- and consumer-level page layout program. Like InDesign,
PageMaker allows you to import a number of file formats — including the native Photoshop
format — and to retain layers.
Unfortunately, unlike InDesign, PageMaker doesn’t support transparency (with the exception
of 1-bit TIFFs saved in Bitmap image mode). That means that if your image contains transpar-
ent areas and you place it over a background containing a color or image, you see a white box
around your image. PageMaker fills all transparent areas with white pixels, as shown in Figure
1-2. Your workaround is one of two methods:

Save your image with a clipping path. (See Book III, Chapter 2, for more on clipping
paths.) PageMaker hides any pixels outside of the path, allowing your image to be sil-
houetted and not boxed in.

Composite your desired background with your image in Photoshop. Save and place it
into PageMaker as a single file.
For bringing in images, PageMaker supports the OLE method (described in the “Microsoft
Word” section, later in this chapter), dragging and dropping, the clipboard copy-and-paste
method, and my preferred method, the good old File➪Place command. PageMaker accepts
PSD, TIFF, EPS, JPEG, GIF, PDF, PICT, and BMP file formats.
I would stay with TIFF or EPS file formats. If you save your file in a PSD format, however,
when you update the file in Photoshop, it is automatically updated in PageMaker. As with
InDesign, for proper color modes and resolution settings for image files to be printed, see
Book II, Chapter 1 (resolution); Book II, Chapter 2 (modes); and Book X, Chapter 2 (prepping
graphics for print).

Acrobat
711
Page layout programs, such as PageMaker, InDesign, and QuarkXPress, make it a snap to
transform your placed images within those programs. It isn’t a disaster to do it within those
programs, but it is really best to do any kind of image manipulation (outside of moving) in
Photoshop. Your image quality will be better retained, and the page layout file prints much
faster and has less potential for errors.
Acrobat
Photoshop can open both generic PDF (Portable Document Format) files and Photoshop PDF
files. You can create generic PDFs in applications such as Acrobat, Illustrator, InDesign, and
PageMaker. These PDFs can be single or multipage documents. When opening a multipage
PDF, Photoshop asks you what pages you want to open. Each page opens in a separate image
window.
Placing a PDF into Photoshop
As I mention in the “Illustrator” section, earlier in this chapter, you can also place a PDF file
into Photoshop by using the File➪Place command.

If you are placing a multi-page PDF, select the page you want to place in the PDF Page Selector
dialog box, shown in Figure 1-3. The placed artwork appears inside a bounding box. Like copy-
ing and pasting an Illustrator file into Photoshop, all the same options in manipulating and
committing the artwork apply here also.
Opening PDF files
To quickly and efficiently open a multi-page PDF, choose File➪Automate➪Multi-page PDF to
PSD. Choose your source PDF, page range, resolution, color mode, and anti-aliasing options.
Then choose your base name for the files. Photoshop will add a number after the base name
that corresponds with the page number. Choose a location for the saved files and click OK.
If you want to open an image, rather than a page, from a PDF, you can use the File➪Import➪
PDF Image command. If it is a multi-image PDF, you can scroll through and select one or more
images. Each image opens as a separate Photoshop file. Note that if other vector graphics
accompany the image, Photoshop imports only the image portion. You can also bring in
PDFs by using the copy-and-paste method and by dragging and dropping.
You can also choose File➪Open and select your PDF file. If it is a multi-page PDF, select your
desired page. In the Rasterize Generic PDF Format dialog box, be sure to select the Constrain
Proportions check box to maintain the aspect ratio, and the Anti-aliased check box to smooth
the edges of any rasterized artwork. When you open generic PDFs in Photoshop, it rasterizes
the entire file.
Saving files as Photoshop PDFs
You can save Photoshop files as Photoshop PDFs. When you save the files, Photoshop pre-
serves all transparency. You can add password protection to secure your PDFs and use the
Include Vector Data option to preserve text and vector graphics as resolution-independent

vector elements. Photoshop PDFs support all the same color modes and features that the
native Photoshop format supports.
Choose File➪Automate➪PDF Presentation to combine multiple images into a single, multi-
paged PDF document. You can find the details in Book X, Chapter 3.
Saving a copy of your Photoshop file as a Photoshop PDF file is especially beneficial in a work-
flow environment where approval is necessary. PDF is a cross-platform and cross-application
file format. “PDFing” preserves and displays all fonts and graphics exactly as they were
intended. Send your PDF to a manager, colleagues, or clients, and the only equipment they
need to view your image, and view it exactly like you do, is a computer and Acrobat Reader,
downloadable for free at www.adobe.com. And if they happen to have the full version of
Acrobat, they can even make notes and annotations within the electronic document.

GoLive is Adobe’s WYSIWYG Web authoring application. If you’re like me and like to design
your Web pages in Photoshop before you write the markup, GoLive is the perfect companion
program for you.
Importing Web pages with GoLive
You can design your entire Web page in Photoshop and import the layered file into GoLive.
You can use the Save for Web dialog box to import and optimize each layer as a separate Web
image. GoLive then saves the optimized image as a floating box that you can move, stack, and
animate on the Web page.
Of course, you can import flattened, nonlayered images as well. You can then select each float-
ing box and drag a Smart Photoshop icon into the box. When you tag it as a Smart Photoshop
Object, you can then edit the original Photoshop image by simply double-clicking any of the
Smart Photoshop images on the page.
Using sliced images with GoLive
GoLive also recognizes sliced Photoshop images. Slices are sections of your image, shown in
Figure 1-4, which you can then optimize individually for speed, appearance, and special func-
tions such as links. (For more on slices, see Book IX, Chapter 3.) Save your sliced image as a
native Photoshop file in your site folder (the folder containing all your Web page images).
Drag the Photoshop image from the site folder onto a new GoLive page. GoLive converts the
sliced image into a Smart Photoshop Object, assembles the slices in a table, and opens the
Save for Web dialog box to optimize the individual slices. You can then use the slices for links,
rollovers, and so on. Because the image slices are Smart Objects, GoLive automatically
updates them when you edit the original Photoshop image.
GoLive recognizes native Photoshop, GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats. Again, keep your images in
RGB color mode and at a low resolution (72 to 96 ppi). For more on resolution, see Book II,
Chapter 1.

Microsoft Word
Photoshop supports Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) on Windows platforms. This means
that you can either link or embed a Photoshop file in what’s called an OLE container applica-
tion. Microsoft Word and Adobe PageMaker are OLE applications.
If you link the Photoshop file in the OLE application, it links, or refers, to the file on the hard
drive or other media; it doesn’t save the Photoshop file with the OLE application file. If you
embed the file, it inserts and saves the file in the OLE application file.
To link or embed an image, you can copy a selection in Photoshop, and then use the Paste
Special command to paste it in your Word document. The selection is embedded, not linked. Or
you can choose the Insert Object command to insert a Photoshop file as an OLE-embedded or
OLE-linked object. The useful thing about using the OLE method is that if you double-click the
linked or embedded image in your Word document, Photoshop automatically launches and
opens the image for editing purposes. After you complete the editing, just close the file if it’s
embedded, or save and close the file if it is linked. Your file is updated in the Word document.
Note that you can also modify the linked file directly in Photoshop without going through
Word. The linked image will be updated the next time you open the document in Word.
If you don’t want to mess around with all this OLE business, you can just save the Photoshop
file in a file format that Word will accept and choose Insert➪Picture➪From File. Word accepts
the following Photoshop file formats: TIFF, EPS, JPEG, GIF, PNG, PCX, and BMP file formats.
I would keep it simple and use TIFF. It’s a good overall format for printing images.

Microsoft PowerPoint
PowerPoint, Microsoft’s presentation program, is fine for creating quick and easy on-screen
and slide presentations. However, it’s a real lame duck when it comes to creating any kind of
graphics that are engaging and even remotely original and creative. That’s why I repeatedly
turn to Photoshop to create all my background slides, shown in Figure 1-5, and to refine any
other images I plan to incorporate into my presentation. You can easily create great back-
grounds by employing filters, layer masks, varying opacity settings, creative brushstrokes,
patterns, and so on.
Follow these steps to create a slide in Photoshop to use in PowerPoint:

Premiere
Premiere is Adobe’s digital-video-editing program. You can import still images from
Photoshop into Premiere and incorporate them with video sequences, sounds, and titles to
create QuickTime, MPEG, AVI, RealMedia, or Windows Media movies. Save your images in RGB
color mode and in the native Photoshop, PICT, GIF, JPEG, TIFF, Filmstrip, TGA, PCX, or BMP
file format.
By default, Premiere alters the size and aspect ratio of the image to match that of the video
frame you specify for your video project. This can vary from 720 x 480 pixels, to 720 x 576, and
so on, depending on whether your intended output is for NTSC, PAL, or multimedia. I recom-
mend setting up your video project in Premiere first, and then sizing your still images in
Photoshop to fit the exact aspect ratio of your video frame. That way, Premiere doesn’t have
to do any sizing, your image quality remains the best possible, and you don’t have files that
are larger than they need to be, as illustrated in Figure 1-6.
To make your preparation of still images for video easier, Photoshop has now provided a
variety of video-sized presets. These are found in the New (File➪New) dialog box on the
Presets pop-up menu. From this dialog box, you can also choose your desired Pixel Aspect
Ratio, such as DI/DV NTSC and Anamorphic 2:1. You can also access these video format
aspect ratios via the Image➪Pixel Aspect Ratio submenu. This enables you to view how a
non-square document will appear on a device that uses non-square pixels, such as video
monitors. These presets also include guidelines that show you the action safe and title safe
areas of the image.
Figure 1-6

In PowerPoint, choose Insert➪
Picture➪From File.
Or you can apply the Photoshop image
on your master slide if you want to
use it throughout your presentation.
In that case, choose View➪Master➪
Slide Master and insert the picture.
You can also get Photoshop images
into PowerPoint by using the Clipboard
method. Select the image in Photoshop
and choose Edit➪Copy. Go into
PowerPoint and choose Edit➪Paste.
However, if you want to print the pres-
entation on a PostScript printer (for
handouts, for example), don’t use the
Clipboard method. Instead, import
your images as TIFFs or EPSs.

Third-Party Plug-Ins
717
If your Photoshop file has layers, you can import the file as a merged file, or you can import
just a single layer. Premiere will preserve any transparency on the layers. After the image is in
Premiere, you can select it and choose Edit➪Edit Original. Photoshop launches, where you
can make your necessary edits. Save and close the file, and it is automatically updated in
Premiere. If you have problems importing a Photoshop file with multiple layers or layer
masks, you may have to flatten the image before importing. Also note that Premiere does not
support 16-bit images.
You can edit individual frames in Premiere movies with Photoshop. Export a Premiere movie
as a Filmstrip file format. In Photoshop, you can then apply filters or paint on the individual
frames. Open the edited filmstrip in Premiere and convert it back into a QuickTime movie.
Just make sure that you don’t resize, resample, change the color mode, or remove alpha chan-
nels in the Filmstrip file, or you won’t be able to save it back in a Filmstrip file format.
Third-Party Plug-Ins
There are more third-party Photoshop plug-ins than you can shake a big stick at. So don’t be
surprised if you come across quite a few that aren’t listed here. To list them all would require

P
reparing images for the screen is a snap compared to what
you have to go through to get images ripe for the printing
process. If all you ever want to do is print your images to a
desktop laser or inkjet printer, the task is a little easier, but you
still must take some guidelines into account. And prepping
your images for offset printing? Well, throw in an additional set
of guidelines. It’s not rocket science, mind you. If you stick to
the basic rules and, more importantly, spend some time devel-
oping a good working relationship with your service bureau
and offset printer, you’ll be good to go.
Getting the Right Resolution,
Mode, and Format
If you’re not familiar with the concept of resolution, I suggest
taking a look at Book II, Chapter 1. That’s where I cover all the
basics on resolution, pixel dimension, resampling, and other
related topics. For full descriptions on color modes and file for-
mats, see Book II, Chapter 2. That said, the next few sections
give you the lowdown on the proper settings for an image that
will ultimately go to print.
Resolution and modes
Table 2-1 provides some guidelines on what resolution settings
to use for specific output. Remember these are just guidelines.
They aren’t chiseled into stone to withstand the sands of time
or anything lofty like that. You need to communicate with your
service bureau, offset printer, or client and get their specifica-
tions and/or recommendations. (See the section, “Working with
a Service Bureau,” later in this chapter.)

*** Warning: CMYK files print only in black.

Screen frequencies
For the appropriate resolution for color separations in Table 2-1, I list the amount of 2 x the
lines per inch. The lines per inch, or lpi, pertains to the screen frequency of the output device.
Screen frequencies are measured in lines per inch in a halftone screen. You will also hear the
terms screen ruling or line screen. When images are digitized, they are converted into a series
of dots called halftones. When you print your halftone, you print it by using a halftone screen
of a certain value. The average screen frequency for printing four-color images is 133 to 175
lpi. Therefore, when you multiply that by 2, you need to create your images by using a resolu-
tion setting of 266 to 350 dots per inch (dpi).
File formats
As far as file formats go, what you choose depends on a couple of issues:

What you intend to do with the image. Print it from Photoshop? Post it on the Web?
Import it into InDesign?

What your service bureau, offset printer, client, director, or other interested parties
prefer.
Table 2-2 lists some of the more popular recommended formats for specific jobs, but again,
communicate with the parties involved to see what is ultimately the best format to use.

Working with a Service Bureau
Service bureaus provide a wide variety of services, depending on their size. Some handle
photo processing and various photographic output options such as prints (of varying sizes)
and slides. Mounting and lamination services may also be provided. Many service bureaus
provide scanning services, including high-end drum scanning. A common service is taking
scans or digital photos and burning them onto Kodak Photo CDs. Many service bureaus pro-
vide output to color separations to film and RC Paper. Larger bureaus may even have a digital
press to handle a short run (500 or less), on-demand printing need.
Getting the ball rolling
Developing a good working relationship with your service bureau and/or offset printer will
save you a lot of time, money, and frustration. These folks are the experts and know their
equipment and processes. And believe me, they’re only too willing to help. The fewer prob-
lems they have with your files, the better they like it. Here are some things you can do to keep
the relationship on solid footing:

Get a dialogue going about the specs: If your file is going directly to a newspaper, mag-
azine, or other publication, talk with the art director, graphics production coordinator,
or other knowledgeable person about the graphic specifications required. Different
service bureaus and offset printers will accept files from different applications and files
of various formats.
Find out which file types the service bureau can handle and/or recommends before you pre-
pare your files. Larger bureaus should be able to handle anything you can throw at them.

Build a lasting relationship: Consistency is also key. When you find a good bureau or
offset printer, stick with it for all your jobs. Jumping from one company to another because
a quote came in a little cheaper doesn’t always pay off in the long run. If you’re a faithful
customer, often your service bureau or offset printer will match that lower quote if it can.
You don’t want to have to relearn what a new company can and can’t do and vice versa.
And if possible, try to let one company handle your entire job. That way, one company
controls the quality from beginning to end, and there’s no finger-pointing if things go bad.

Get on the Web: Many service bureaus have Web sites where you can find a listing of
services they offer, price lists, file specs, and even downloadable order forms, as shown
in Figure 2-1. Larger offset printers also have Web sites offering general information and

Working with a Service Bureau
725
online requests for quote applications. Larger offset printers may provide services such
as scanning and film-separation output, so be sure to check the Web site for details.
Using a prepress checklist
In addition to communicating with your offset printers and service bureau, you need to do
some additional work to prepare your file for print. Here is a handy checklist that you can
use whenever you’re prepping a file for print. Use it to ensure your file is ready and rarin’ for
problem-free output. Note that this list isn’t all-inclusive when it comes to prepress; I include
tips that pertain to Photoshop only.

Always transform your images in their native application. Size, crop, rotate, shear,
and reflect art in Photoshop. Transforming images in an illustration or page layout pro-
gram is very complex and calculation-intensive and will cause the RIP (raster image pro-
cessing, which converts objects to a series of dots/pixels for printing) to take a long
time to process the file.

Ensure that images can first print from Photoshop. Do this before importing the
images into an illustration or page layout program.

If you’re placing Photoshop EPS images into a page layout or illustration program,
set the halftone screen frequency in the destination program instead of embedding it
in each image in Photoshop. Or better yet, don’t set any halftone screen frequencies in
your images and let your service bureau or offset printer handle setting them in the
other program.

When saving Photoshop images for print purposes, stick to TIFF, EPS, native PSD, or
PDF file formats. If you’re unsure of the proper format to use for a specific job, ask your
offset printer or service bureau for recommendations.


Make sure that you have used the proper color mode. For example, use CMYK for
color separations and RGB for slide output. Again, if you’re not sure, ask your offset
printer or service bureau for recommendations.

Create vector shapes and paths efficiently. Printing vector art involves using intense
calculations for every anchor point, and overly complex paths can cause problems
during the RIP process. Here are some suggestions:
 Use the fewest number of anchor points possible to draw the shape or create the
path and delete any unnecessary objects or points, even those that are invisible.
 Simplify the complexity and number of vector masks and clipping paths.
 Set optimum flatness levels for paths, dependent on complexity of the path and
output resolution. Use 1–3 for low-resolution printing (300–600 dpi as with laser
printers) and 7–10 for complex paths on high-resolution printing devices (1,200 and
up as with imagesetters). Or you can leave the flatness setting text box blank. In that
case, Photoshop uses the default setting for the output device, which is usually a
safe bet.

Limit the number of typefaces. Downloading takes time. Limiting the number of
typefaces also makes your document look more sophisticated and polished.

Make sure that all scanning is at the appropriate dpi. As a general rule, 2 x line screen
(lines per inch or lpi) equals the dpi to use in scanning the images. If you need to resize
your image, be sure to scan it at a higher resolution accordingly. For example, if you
need it twice as big, scan it at twice the final resolution needed.

If your image is to bleed (extend to the edge of the printed page), take that into
account when creating your image. Note that you need to allow for 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 of an inch
on any side that will bleed to allow for slippages when the paper is cut.

Always specify colors from a Pantone color swatch chart and then select the color,
whether process or spot, in Photoshop. Never trust the way colors look on-screen
because of calibration deficiencies and differences between RGB and CMYK color models.

Make spot color names consistent. Make sure that the Photoshop spot color names
exactly match those of any programs to which you are importing your image, such as an
illustration or page layout program. Otherwise, you may get an additional color separation.

Print and provide laser prints of your file, both separations (if warranted), and a
composite print. Print all with printer marks — crop marks, registration marks, labels,
and so on.

Provide all fonts used in your file. Provide both screen and PostScript printer fonts.
(Note: Avoid cheapie fonts; you usually get what you pay for. If you want to use them,
consider rasterizing them.)

Choose File➪Save As for your final save to squeeze down to the smallest file size.
Doing a Save As compresses your file as small as possible.

Organize your files into folders. For example, put the image files together in one folder,
all the fonts in another, and so on. Practice good file management and organization.

Communicate any trapping needs to your service bureau or offset printer. For color
separations, indicate whether you have created the trapping yourself or if you want the
service bureau/offset printer to do it.

Using Photoshop to Rasterize and Print Unruly Vector Art
727
Saving and Printing Vector Data in a Raster File
Photoshop allows you to create vector shapes and vector type with the Pen tools, Shape
tools, and Type tools. Technically, the vector shapes are clipping paths applied to a bitmap, or
raster, layer. But the clipping path is still a vector path, thereby retaining vector qualities. This
vector data is resolution independent, which means that it will print at the resolution of the
PostScript output device. Photoshop sends the printer separate images for each type and
shape layer, which are printed on top of the raster image and clipped by using their vector
paths. The edges of the vector path print at the full resolution of the PostScript printer, but
the contents, such as the colored pixels or the image pixels within the vector path, print at
the resolution of the Photoshop file (all portions of the type are resolution independent).
Therefore, type and shapes will always have crisp, hard edges, with curves appearing smooth
and never jagged.
Remember that the only file formats that will allow you to retain vector data are PSD, PDF, DCS,
and EPS. When saving to PDF, DCS, or EPS, be sure to select the Include Vector Data option in
their respective Options dialog boxes. All other file formats will rasterize the vector data.
When you print the file, be sure to choose File➪Print with Preview. Then in the Print with
Preview dialog box, select the Show More Options check box, select Choose Output from the
pop-up menu, and select the Include Vector Data option.
Using Photoshop to Rasterize and Print Unruly Vector Art
Now that I have touted the merits of preserving vector art whenever possible, let me also give
raster art an attaboy. If you are a user of drawing programs, such as Illustrator, FreeHand, or
CorelDraw, you may occasionally run across a complex drawing with a multitude of anchor
points that won’t print. As a fail-safe, you can rasterize the drawing in Photoshop and print it
from there. Sure, you lose the crisp, clean vector lines, but at least you get some output. And
if you rasterize it at a high enough resolution, you’ll probably be okay.
You can rasterize your vector art in several ways in Photoshop:

Choose File➪Open. Select your file and click Open. In the Rasterize Generic EPS Format
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2, specify your dimensions, resolution, and color mode.
Select Constrain Proportions to maintain your aspect ratio. Select Anti-aliased to
slightly soften the edges of the artwork and minimize jaggies.
Book
X
Chapter
2
If you save your file as an EPS or DCS and
reopen the file in Photoshop, Photoshop raster-
izes the vector data to pixels. Save the original in
the native PSD format.
If you save your layered file as an EPS,
Photoshop converts your vector type to clipping
paths. Extensive and small type creates complex
clipping paths, which can be time consuming
and sometimes difficult to print. You can either
flatten your file or deselect the Include Vector
Data option in the Save as EPS Options dialog
box. Either choice rasterizes the type into pixels
at the resolution of your image. You may want
to consider eliminating the type in your image
file and applying it either in a drawing or page
layout program that can retain vector type.
Some file format warnings

Book X  Chapter 2: Prepping Graphics for Print


Create a new Photoshop file at your desired dimension, resolution, and color mode.
Choose File➪Place, select the vector file (EPS or the latest native Illustrator, FreeHand,
or CorelDraw format), and click OK. The vector artwork comes into the Photoshop
image window. If you need to size the image, hold down the Shift key and grab a handle
on the corner. When you’re finished, press Enter (Return on the Mac). The vector art is
rasterized at the resolution of the Photoshop file and resides on a separate layer.

Drag and drop the vector artwork from the drawing program into Photoshop. Just
drag from one window to the other. The artwork automatically becomes rasterized at
the resolution of the Photoshop document. To drag the artwork as paths, press the Ctrl
key (Ô on the Mac) when dragging. You can also use the clipboard method by using the
Edit➪Copy and Edit➪Paste commands. For more on the clipboard method, see Book X,
Chapter 1.
Choosing Color Management Print Options
I highly recommend checking out the color management section in Book II, Chapter 3. There I
go into great detail on the concept of color spaces, ICC profiles, and so on. Here, I cover the
color management options you’ll find in the Print with Preview dialog box.
Different output devices operate in different color spaces. Monitors, desktop printers, large
format printers, film recorders, offset printers, and so on all have their own unique color
space. The color management options enable you to convert the color space of your image
while printing. So, for example, if the ICC (color) profile of your image is sRGB, you can
choose to have your image’s color space converted to the color space of your Epson printer
when you print.
Choose File➪Print with Preview to open the Print dialog box, shown in Figure 2-3. Select the
Show More Options check box and choose Color Management from the pop-up menu below it.
In the Source Space area, choose from these options:

Document: Uses the color profile of your image.

Proof Setup: Uses the color profile of the proof you selected in the View➪Proof Setup
menu. For details on proofs, see Book II, Chapter 3.
In the Print Space area, you have these options:

Profile: Choose Same as Source to print using the color profile you specified for your
Source Space. If you want to print by using the color profile of an output device — for
example, an HP or Epson printer — choose that profile from the list.
Figure 2-2

Getting Four-Color Separations
729
Choose PostScript Color Management to print to a PostScript printer (PS level 2 or
higher). Photoshop will then instruct the printer to manage the color conversion
instead of Photoshop.

Intent: I recommend leaving this at the default setting of Relative Colorimetric and also
leaving the Use Black Point Compensation check box deselected — unless, of course,
you’re a color guru and have a better reason not to.
When you finish making your selections, click Print. That’s all there is to it. If you want more
information on printing, check out Book II, Chapter 3.
If all you want to do is print color prints on your desktop printer, I recommend choosing
Document for your Source Space and choosing Same as Source for your Print Space. If you have
a little time and paper to burn, then print another copy by using your printer’s color profile for
your Print Space. Do a side-by-side comparison to see which one looks superior. You can also
crack the seal on the documentation that came with your printer for any recommendations.
When it comes to color management and printing, experimentation can really pay off. Try
different color spaces for both Source and Print Spaces and compare the printouts. You’ll
even get different results from different types of paper. When you have some free time, get to
know your printer and its strengths, shortcomings, and quirks.
Getting Four-Color Separations
It is necessary to color separate your image whenever you plan to print your image to an offset
press. Your image must first be in CMYK color mode (choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK Color).
Then the composite color image gets digitally separated into the four-color channels — cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black — and is output. (These colors are also known as process colors.)
Sometimes the separation output is onto film, and sometimes, it is output directly to aluminum
Figure 2-3

printing plates. The plates are put on an offset press, paper runs through each of the four inked
rollers (cyan first, then magenta, yellow, and finally black), and out comes your composite
image.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Getting laser separations
Before you take your image to a service bureau or offset printer to get color separations, it is
wise to get what are called laser separations. Basically, you are color separating your image,
not to film or plates, but to paper. If it doesn’t separate to paper, most likely it won’t to film or
plates, either. This allows you to go back and troubleshoot the problem and correct it, rather
than paying upwards of $80 to $150 an hour to have the service bureau or offset printer cor-
rect it for you. Consider it a cheap insurance policy.
Check out Color Plate 10-1, which illustrates the separations as they would appear in the
actual printing process. Here are the steps to print laser separations:
Book X  Chapter 2: Prepping Graphics for Print
730
1.
Be sure your image mode is CMYK. If
it isn’t, choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK
Color.
I’m assuming your image is a four-color
image. But it may also be a grayscale,
duotone, tritone, or quadtone image, in
which case no conversion to CMYK is
necessary. (See Book II, Chapter 2 for
more on modes.)
If you’re new to converting RGB images
to CMYK, don’t be surprised if your
vibrant colors turn muddy and flat.
This is because the gamut, a fancy
word for range of color, for CMYK is
much smaller than it is for RGB, and
Photoshop converts colors that are out
of the CMYK gamut to their closest
match. It’s a cold, harsh fact that we all
have to live with. After the conversion,
you have an image with four channels —
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
b Choose File➪Print with Preview. In
the Print dialog box (see Figure 2-4)
select the Show More Options check
box and select Color Management
from the pop-up menu below it.
c Under Source Space, select Document.
It should say U.S. Web Coated
(SWOP) v2.
d Under Print Space, select Separations
from the Profile pop-up menu.
This option prints each of the channels
from the image to a separate plate, or
in the case of laser separations, paper.
5.
Select Output from the Show More
Options pop-up menu. Then select
additional options as desired.
For general print options, see Book I,
Chapter 4. For additional options, check
out the next section in this chapter.
6.
Click the Print button.
If all goes well, four pieces of paper, one
for each of the four CMYK channels,
should print, as shown in Figure 2-5. If
you’re printing a grayscale, duotone, tri-
tone, or quadtone image, you get one to
four pieces of paper, one for each color
used. If that doesn’t happen, some-
thing’s amiss, and it’s time for trouble-
shooting. Be sure to take these laser
separations with you when you hand
over your file to the service bureau or
offset printer. They’ll be appreciative of
your taking the time to ensure that your
file separates okay.


Screen: Click the Screen button to create a custom halftone screen by changing the
size, angle, and shape of the halftone dots. I would leave this set to Use Printer’s Default
Screen. Let the service bureau or offset printer change it if necessary.

Transfer: This option allows you to redistribute brightness levels in your image. Again, I
wouldn’t mess with this setting unless you’re a prepress professional.

Interpolation: This option is available for PostScript Level 2 or later printers to anti-
alias low-resolution images by resampling. Leave it deselected.

Calibration Bars: Select this option. It prints an 11-step grayscale bar outside the image
area to gauge how accurately the shades are being printed. When printing separations,
this option prints a gradient tint bar and color bar.

Registration Marks: Select this option, which prints crosshair and target marks outside
the image area, allowing you to line up the four plates or pages.

Corner Crop Marks: Select this option. It adds crops marks at the corners of the image
to indicate where the image should be trimmed.

Center Crop Marks: Select this option. It adds crop marks at the center of each side of
the image to indicate where the image should be trimmed.


Emulsion Down: Leave this option deselected for laser separations. Emulsion is the side
of the film that is light sensitive. When the service bureau or offset printer prints the
separations to film or plates, it may select this option, which allows the film to be
printed with the emulsion side down.

Negative: Leave this option deselected for laser separations. When the service bureau
or offset printer prints the separations to film or plates, it may select this option, which
prints black as white and white as black, and every other color inverts accordingly.

Include Vector Data: Leave this option selected if you have type or vector paths. See
the “Saving and Printing Vector Data in a Raster File” section, earlier in this chapter.

Encoding: This option specifies the method of encoding used to send the image to the
printer. Leave this option at the default of Binary.
Note that if you’re printing to a non-PostScript printer, some of these options may not be
available. You see a preview of most of these options as you apply them to your file.
Creating Spot Color Separations
Photoshop allows you to add separate channels for spot colors (see Book VI, Chapter 1, for more
on channels), which can then be color separated. Spot, or custom, colors are premixed inks man-
ufactured by various ink companies, the most popular in the U.S. being Pantone. Other popular
companies include Toyo and Focoltone. A spot color is often used for a logo, type, or small illus-
tration. Spot colors are also used when you need to apply metallic inks or varnishes to your
print job. Spot colors can be used instead of, or in addition to, the four process CMYK colors.
Usually, it’s easier and more convenient to add the spot color graphic — especially if it is type or
a vector shape — in another program, such as a drawing program like Illustrator or a page layout
program like InDesign. But if the spot color graphic has a Photoshop special effect applied to it
or is an integral part of the Photoshop image, then create your spot channel(s) in Photoshop.
If you are delving into the world of spot colors, I highly recommend that you choose your
color from a printed Pantone swatch book, available from www.pantone.com. Because
your screen is an RGB device and you’re setting up your file for a CMYK output device, the
colors you see on-screen do not match the colors that will ultimately be printed on paper
and at best are a ballpark match. For accuracy, you must select the colors from the printed
swatch book. For more on working with color and output, see Book II, Chapter 3.

Creating a spot channel
Follow these steps to create a spot channel:
1.
Create the graphic or type to which
you want to apply the spot color on a
separate layer.
2.
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on the Mac) to
select the graphic and then fill it with
any solid color and an opacity of 100%.

▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼

Book X  Chapter 2: Prepping Graphics for Print

3.
With your selection active, choose
Window➪Channels, and choose
New Spot Channel from the Channels
palette pop-up menu.
A spot color can be applied only to an
active selection. It can’t be applied just
to a layer.
The New Spot Channel dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 2-7.
d In the Name text box, enter a name
for your spot color. In the Ink
Characteristics area, click the color
swatch.
I recommend naming it according to
the spot color you want to use, such as
Pantone 3405 C or PMS 3405 C. PMS
stands for Pantone Matching System.
When you click the color swatch, the
Color Picker appears.
e Click the Custom button in the Color
Picker and select your Pantone color
from the Custom Colors dialog box
that appears (see Figure 2-7). Then
click OK.
6.
In the New Spot Channel dialog box,
select a Solidity value between 0% to
100%.
A value of 100% represents an ink that
is completely opaque, such as a metal-
lic ink, which completely covers the
inks beneath it. A value of 0% repre-
sents a transparent ink, such as a clear
varnish. But the solidity value affects
only the screen view and composite
prints; it doesn’t affect the separations.
It can be helpful to see where a “clear”
varnish will print.
g Click OK to close the dialog box.
Your spot channel appears in the
Channels palette and is filled in the
image as well. I created a spot channel
for my sun graphic and for the
Australia type, as shown in Figure 2-8.
In the printing process, spot colors are
overprinted on top of the four-color
image. That means that the spot color
is applied at the end of the printing
process and is printed over the other
inks. This can sometimes cause lighter
spot colors to darken somewhat.
If you need your spot color graphic to
knock out the underlying image, you
should create it in an illustration or
page layout program. A knockout is
when a hole is left in the four-color
image, and the spot ink then fills that
hole. It does not print over the other
inks.
8.
Save the image in the native
Photoshop, Photoshop PDF, or
Photoshop DCS 2.0 (Desktop Color
Separations) format.
If the image is being separated directly
out of Photoshop, leave it as a PSD or
PDF file. If you want to import it into a
different program, such as PageMaker,
InDesign, or QuarkXPress, you must
save it as a DCS file. You also have to
go through a few more hoops: If your
image is a duotone, tritone, or quad-
tone image, you must first convert it
to multichannel mode with the Image➪
Mode command.
In the DCS 2.0 Format dialog box, make
sure that the Include Halftone Screen
and Include Transfer options are not
selected.
Import the image into your destination
application and set your screen angles.
(Also, you can have your service
bureau or offset printer do it, but let
them know what spot colors you want
for each spot separation.)

Editing a spot channel
After you create a spot channel, you can edit it. Select the channel in the Channels palette and
use a painting or editing tool to paint with black, white, or any shade of gray, just as you
would with an alpha channel. To change any of the options of the spot channel, double-click
the spot channel thumbnail, or select it and choose Channel Options from the palette pop-up
menu. Choose a different color or solidity.
You probably won’t ever need to do this, but to merge a spot channel, select it and choose
Merge Spot Channel from the palette pop-up menu. This converts the spot color and divides
it among the four process color channels. Photoshop then deletes the spot channel and flat-
tens all layers in your image. Also, the spot color will now print according to the closest
match it can reproduce by using process colors. And sometimes this isn’t a very good match
because CMYK inks can’t reproduce the range of colors offered by spot inks.
Book X  Chapter 2: Prepping Graphics for Print
736
If you want to convert an alpha channel to a spot
channel, select the alpha channel in the Channels
palette and choose Channel Options from the
palette pop-up menu. Rename the channel and
select Spot Color. Choose a color from the Custom
section of the Color Picker. Click OK. Note that
Photoshop converts all areas containing nonwhite
pixels (unselected to partially selected areas) to the
spot color. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Invert to
apply the spot color to the white pixels or selected
areas of the alpha channel. For details on alpha
channels, see Book VI, Chapter 1.

T
he Contact Sheet II and Picture Package features are two
common tasks that are tedious to perform manually. You
can use these features to create documents of thumbnail
images of groups of files and print multiple copies of a single
image on one sheet, much like the picture packages of 5 x 7s
and wallet prints you order from school photographers.
Both features make use of the same Photoshop scripting/
macro facility called actions, as I describe in Book II, Chapter 6.
Indeed, if you wanted to take the time, you could create a
Photoshop action that performs much the same function as the
Contact Sheet II and Picture Package features. However, creat-
ing these actions is a bit tricky, and why would you bother? The
programming wizards at Adobe have done all the work for you.
This chapter leads you through creating contact sheets and
picture packages.
Cataloging with Contact Sheets
If you’re not steeped in photographic darkroom lore (and
fewer of us are, in these digital days), the term contact sheet
might be fuzzy to you. A traditional photographic contact sheet
is made by placing one or more negatives on a piece of photo-
graphic paper that is held in tight contact with the paper while
a light exposes the light-sensitive surface of the paper. A special
frame or a piece of glass mates the negatives and paper for the
exposure.
The original purpose of contact sheets, like the one shown in
Figure 3-1, was to show the photographer a small image of each
picture in a set of negatives so they could be compared, per-
haps cropped with a grease pencil right on the contact sheet,
and the images to be printed could be selected. Contact sheets
also made a convenient way of filing away images as a sort of
hard copy catalog.

Understanding the benefits of Contact Sheet II
Today, we have more sophisticated ways of previewing and cataloging digital images, includ-
ing many different image-cataloging programs, such as Adobe’s own Photoshop Album appli-
cation. Nearly every digital camera comes with one of the cataloging programs. Even so, the
Contact Sheet II automated tool in Photoshop has some useful features:

Prepares Photoshop documents so that you can store them, share them with others in
digital form, or print them for distribution.

Works faster than database-type catalog programs that require you to enter keywords
to sort and locate images.

Creates ad-hoc catalogs adeptly. Just copy the files you want to include to a folder and
fire up the Contact Sheet II tool.

Allows you to specify the number of rows and columns in your contact sheet, filling a
sheet with only a few images (if that’s what you want) or packing dozens of them on a
single contact sheet.

Automatically creates multiple sheets if all the selected images won’t fit on a single sheet.

Using Contact Sheet II
With Contact Sheet II, you can create contact sheets that have many thumbnail images on a
single page. You can print the contact sheets or browse through them electronically. To create
a contact sheet catalog of your own images, follow these steps:

Copy all the files you want to include
in your contact sheet into a folder on

The Contact Sheet II dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Note that you can find both the Contact
Sheet II and Picture Package commands
on the Automate menu in the File
Browser. This makes for easy and quick
visual selection of images to catalog or
package. Check out Book I, Chapter 5 for
more on the File Browser.
3.
In the Source Images area, click the
Browse button (Choose on the Mac)
and navigate to the folder containing
the images you want to include.
From the Use pop-up menu, you can
also choose Selected Images from File
Browser or Current open documents.
d Choose the Include All Subfolders
option if you want to include images
contained in folders nested within the
main folder you select.
In the Document area, you have several
settings that you can use to control the
size and type of thumbnail you create.
e Choose your desired unit of measure-
ment from the Units pop-up menu. In
the Width and Height boxes, enter the
dimensions of the contact sheet
document.
Choose the default setting of 8 x 10
inches if you plan to print contact
sheets on standard-sized paper.
f Adjust the resolutions settings.
A setting of 72 pixels/inch works well
for contact sheets if all you want is a
quick-and-dirty look at them. Use a
higher resolution if you want a sharper
contact sheet.
If you’re showing the contact sheets to a
client or you want the individual images to
look crisp and clear, choose a higher reso-
lution. Also, if you want the thumbnails to
be larger (with fewer per page), choose a
higher resolution and adjust the number
of columns and rows in Step 10.
Check out Book II, Chapter 1 and Book
X, Chapter 2 for more recommenda-
tions on resolution settings.
g Choose a color mode from the Mode
pop-up menu.
RGB works best in most cases.
However, if your images happen to be
black-and-white photos, you can create
smaller, more compact contact sheet
files by selecting the Grayscale option.
Check your printer documentation to see
the color mode recommended for printing
color images. You’ll find more information
on color modes in Book II, Chapter 2.
8.
Select the Flatten All Layers check
box if you want to create a contact
sheet with a single layer in which all
images and their captions (if any) are
merged.
This option significantly reduces the con-
tact sheet’s file size — which is a very
good thing if you have several images in
the contact sheet. Otherwise, the file can
be huge!
If you do not select this option, you’ll
end up with larger contact sheet files,
but you have the additional flexibility
of flattening the thumbnails yourself
later both with and without captions.
Or, you can make certain layers invisi-
ble or visible to show or hide some of
the images.
You can now start adjusting the layout.
A preview window at the right side of
the dialog box shows roughly how the
contact sheet will be laid out.

j In the Columns and Rows text boxes,
enter the number of columns and

The more rows and columns, the
smaller each thumbnail image. Beneath
the small layout preview on the right
side of the dialog box are the number
of pages in your contact sheet, the
total number of images, and the largest
possible size of each image.
If you choose a small number of rows
and columns to produce fairly large
thumbnails, you get an effect much like
Picture Package (described later). For
example, choose 1 Column and 2 Rows
to create a contact sheet with two
images, each 4.6 x 5 inches.
If you plan to print such a maxi-thumbnail
contact sheet, you’ll probably want to
choose a higher resolution (such as 144
pixels/inch) to allow sharper thumbnails.
Select the Auto-Spacing option to have
the default distance of .014 inches verti-
cally and horizontally between each
thumbnail option. Deselect the option to
enter a custom distance. Select the Rotate
For Best Fit option to have Photoshop
rotate the thumbnails if necessary to
accommodate a better fit based on your
specifications.

option to identify each image easily.
You can also select the Font and Font
Size from the option lists.

Click OK to create your contact sheet.
If you change your mind, press the
Esc key to quit.

Pretty as a Picture Package
If you remember having your class pictures taken as a child or have ever gone to a retailer or
professional photographer’s studio, then you have probably seen the contact sheets that
come from these photo sessions. You purchase one of those special deals and wind up with,
say, an 8-x-10-inch print, two 5 x 7s, four 4 x 5s, and eight wallet-sized shots.
The number of pictures you get at each of these dimensions isn’t pulled out of a hat. That’s
the number of images at a given size that can be fit on a single 8-x-10-inch sheet of photo-
graphic paper.
Photofinishers have automated printers that can expose those duplicates onto a standard-
sized section of a roll of photographic paper, which is then processed and cut apart by mecha-
nized equipment.
Photoshop can perform much the same magic with your own photos, creating image docu-
ments that you can then print as your own picture packages. This is much easier and faster

Frontmost Document to create the pic-
ture package from the image that is
currently selected in Photoshop, or
choose File and select a single file
from your hard drive. Click Browse
(Choose on the Mac) to navigate to
files or folders.
If you select Folder to create picture
packages from all the files in a folder,
all the picture packages must use the
same parameters that you enter in the
Picture Package dialog box. You can
also use images that you have prese-
lected from the File Browser.
4.
If you’d like to include more than one
picture in a picture package, click a
sample thumbnail in the Layout area
of the dialog box.
A Select an Image File dialog box
appears.
5.
Find the image you want to substitute
and click it.
The image appears in the thumbnail
you chose in Step 4.
6.
Repeat to insert other images in the
picture package.
g Choose a setting for Page Size from
the list.
In most cases, you’ll want to use 8 x 10
inches. You can also select 10 x 16 inches
or 11 x 17 inches if you have a printer that
can handle larger sheets of paper.
8.
Choose a layout.
You can fill an entire sheet with only
one size photo, if you like, such as two
5-x-7-inch pictures or eight 2.5-x-3.5-
inch pictures. Or you can select one of
the other combinations, such as two
4 x 5s, two 2.5 x 3.5s, or four 2-x-2.5-
inch photos.
i Adjust the resolution settings.
The default value is 72 pixels/inch.
You’ll probably want a higher resolu-
tion, such as 300 pixels/inch, if you
plan to print the picture package.
Check your printer documentation
to see the recommended resolution.
Also check out Book II, Chapter 1 and
Book X, Chapter 2 for more on recom-
mended resolution settings.
j Choose a color mode from the Mode
pop-up menu.
RGB is the best choice in most cases.
However, if your images happen to be
black and white, you can create
smaller, more compact picture package
files by selecting the Grayscale option.
Check your printer documentation.
11.
Select the Flatten All Layers option to
create a picture package with a single
layer in which Photoshop merges all
images and their labels (if you choose
to apply them).
l If you want to apply some text, you
can do it in the Label area of the
dialog box.
Most picture packages don’t require
any sort of text descriptions, but the
option is available if you want it. You
can choose content such as Filename,
Copyright, Credit, and so on.
13.
Select Custom Text from the Content
pop-up menu to type your own text.

Using the Photomerge Command
The Photomerge command allows you to combine multiple images into one continuous
panoramic image. For example, you can take several overlapping photos of a mountain
range and put them together into one panoramic shot, as shown in Figure 3-5. If you know
you ultimately want to create a Photomerge composition, you can make things easier by
making sure that when you shoot your photos, you overlap your individual images by 15 to
40 percent, but no more than 70 percent. Adobe also recommends avoiding using distortion
lenses (such as fish-eye) and your camera’s zoom setting. Finally, try to stay in the same posi-
tion and keep your camera at the same level for each shot. Using a tripod and rotating the
head can help you achieve this consistency.

Here are the steps to assemble your own Photomerge composition:
Figure 3-5
1.
Choose File➪Automate➪Photomerge.
You can also choose the Photomerge
command from the menu in the File
Browser. To do so, select your desired
source images and choose Automate
Photomerge from the File Browser menu.
Using the File Browser method is a time-
saver because you can quickly and visu-
ally select your images.
2.
In the first Photomerge dialog box,
choose your source files. You can
select from Files (uses individual files
you choose), Folder (uses all images
in a folder), or Open Files (uses all
currently open files) from the Use
pop-up menu. Click the Browse
button to navigate to your desired
files or folder.
If you want to delete a file from the list,
select it and click Remove.
3.
From the list of files, select the ones
you want to merge. Select the Attempt
to Automatically Arrange Source files
option to direct Photoshop to try to
compose the panorama automatically.
Click OK.
Photoshop will open and assemble the
source files to create the composite
panorama.
d Photoshop alerts you if it cannot auto-
matically composite your source files.
You will then have to manually drag
the images from the lightbox to the
work area in the second Photomerge
dialog box to assemble them for your-
self. See Figure 3-6.
To manually assemble your composi-
tion, drag the image thumbnails from
the lightbox area onto the work area
with the Select Image tool (the arrow).
Or simply double-click on the lightbox
thumbnail to add it to the composition.
You can also drag an image from the
work area and back into the lightbox to
remove it from the composition.
In addition, you can position the
images or rearrange their order also
using this same tool. Use the Rotate
Image tool to rotate any images. And
use the Zoom and Move View (more
commonly known as the Hand tool)
tools to help view and navigate around
your composition. You can also use the
Navigator view box to zoom in and out
of your composition. See Book I,
Chapter 5 if you need more details on
using these tools.
Select the Snap to Image option to have
Photoshop automatically snap overlapping
images into place.
5.
To adjust the vanishing point, first
select the Perspective option under
Settings. Then, click your desired
image with the Set Vanishing Point
tool, which you can select from the
Photomerge tools palette on the left.

Using the Photomerge Command
745
Book

Photoshop then changes the perspec-
tive of the composition. By default,
Photoshop selects the center image as
the vanishing point (look for the
turquoise border). If you need to, you
can move the other images (they will
have a red border).
Note, however, that when you select
the Perspective setting, Photoshop
links non-vanishing point images to the
vanishing point image. To break the
link, click the Normal setting button or
separate the images in the work area.
You can also drag the vanishing point
image back into the lightbox.
f Adjust the blending of the composition.
Choose Cylindrical Mapping to reduce
the bowed distortion you can get when
you add perspective to your composi-
tion. (Note that you must select
Perspective in the Settings area in
order to apply cylindrical mapping.)
Select Advanced Blending to correct
the color differences that can occur
from blending images with different
exposures. Photoshop then blends the
colors and tones.
Click Preview to view your settings.
Click Exit Preview to return to the Edit
mode. You can also view the results in
the final, rendered image.
g Select the Keep as Layers option to
save each image in the composite as
an individual layer.
8.
Click OK to generate the composite
panorama as a new Photoshop file
which will open in Photoshop. Or
click Save Composition to save the
composite as a .pmg (Photomerge
format) file, which you can later open
in the Photomerge dialog box.
To open a previously saved composite
(.pmg file), click the Open Composition
button in the Photomerge dialog box.

Creating PDF Presentations
Yet another new feature found on the Automate menu, the PDF Presentation command,
allows you to use multiple images to create a single, multi-paged document or slide show.
This feature is great for several reasons. First, your recipient doesn’t need to have any specific
hardware, software, utilities, or fonts to open and view the presentation. All that is required is
Acrobat Reader, a free download from www.adobe.com. In addition, sending a single file
containing multiple images is a great way to share your photos with family and friends. You
avoid the hassle of having to e-mail your images as separate attachments. Finally, the PDF
format offers excellent compression, thereby squeezing your file size down significantly with-
out sacrificing image quality.
Follow these steps to create a PDF Presentation:
1.
Choose File➪Automate➪PDF
Presentation.
The PDF Presentation dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Note that you can also access the PDF
Presentation command from the menu in
the File Browser. Select your desired
images in the File Browser and choose
Automate➪PDF Presentation. Note that if
you do not select any images, the com-
mand selects all images displayed in the
File Browser.
b Click the Browse button and navigate
to your desired files. If you want to
add the files you already have open
in Photoshop, select the Add Open
Files option.
Remove files from the list by selecting
them and clicking the Remove button.
c Choose either a Multi-Page Document
or a Presentation (slideshow).
A multi-page document displays each
image on a separate page.
Note that the PDF Presentation command
preserves any notes added with the Notes
tool. In addition, Photoshop reimports a
multi-page document or PDF presenta-
tion file with comments that have been
added in Acrobat. This is a great tool
for presenting projects to clients or
management and receiving feedback
from those recipients.
4.
Select the View PDF after Saving
option to have Acrobat or Acrobat
Reader launch and open the PDF after
you save the file.
e If you selected Presentation in Step 3,
specify your presentation options.
 Advance Every [5] Seconds:
Establishes how long each image
appears on-screen. You can change
the default of 5 seconds.
 Loop After Last Page: Enables the
presentation to continually run. If

after the last image.
 Transition: From the pop-up menu,
choose how you want one image to
transition to the next.

S
canners and digital cameras are great tools for Photoshop
users, providing basic fodder for your image-editing
exploits. Scanners and digital cameras are also great
resources that let you grab images quickly when you need them
most (say, when you’re under a deadline and need to drop that
last object into your image or project). This appendix helps you
transport images from digital sensor to Photoshop.
Opening an Image from 
Your Digital Camera
Although importing digital camera images into Photoshop isn’t
an open-and-shut case, it needn’t be a trial. In fact, it’s likely
that you have two or three different ways to transport your
digital pictures from the camera to your computer’s hard disk
storage. You can choose whichever method is easiest for you.
The following sections list the most common methods.
Wires and cables: USB, FireWire, and IEEE-1394
Most new cameras are furnished with USB or FireWire connec-
tions (or ports) that allow linking directly to a Windows or Mac
OS computer (see Figure A-1). All newer computers are
equipped with matching USB ports (either the older USB 1.x or
the newer, faster USB 2.0), and some, particularly Macs, also
have FireWire connections. If your computer lacks either or
both of these ports, you can usually purchase a peripheral card
that will add the missing connection. Some combo cards have
both USB and FireWire ports.
Some older cameras use a computer’s conventional serial port
(such as the one used with a modem, mouse, or serial printer)
or the computer’s parallel port (used with printers). Because
such connections are slower and can be more difficult to set
up, they have fallen from favor.

Direct wireless connections
A few digital cameras have included infrared capabilities, which allow wireless transfer of
images to printers, laptops, or desktop computers equipped with an IrDA-compatible port.
(IrDA stands for Infrared Data Association.) Any growth of IrDA applications is likely to be
stunted by the coming availability of Bluetooth technology, which will allow rapid wireless
transfer of information between many different devices, ranging from cell phones to remote
controls to digital cameras. Although Bluetooth digital cameras are only beginning to go on
the market as I write this, you can expect to see them become more widely available in the
near future.
Removable storage media
Only the least expensive digital cameras use ports and cables as their only means of transfer-
ring images. Almost all cameras use storage media that you can remove from the camera and
read directly by using a card reader or some other device in your computer.
Here are the most common removable storage media options:

SmartMedia or CompactFlash cards: These solid-state memory cards are thin, conven-
ient, and can hold between 8MB and 512MB of data (some cards can hold even more
data) at attractive prices (considering the fact that you can use them over and over).
Figure A-2 shows a CompactFlash card.
Some digital cameras have a slot for one of these two media. To read them with your
computer, you need a card reader accessory, which is usually a small USB device (often
with slots for both types of cards), or an adapter (such as a PC card slot found in most
laptops and many desktop computers). Some scanners and printers also have memory
card slots, which you can use to transfer photos to your computer.

Secure Digital card: This is the most common memory card in digital cameras. This
card is smaller than SmartMedia or Compact Flash cards and also requires a card
reader accessory so that your computer can read the card.

Memory Sticks: Sony uses these memory devices, which are about the size of a stick of
chewing gum, for cameras, audio devices, and laptop PCs. (Sony has also offered floppy
disks and recordable CDs, or CD-Rs, as storage in its digital cameras.) The same type of
card readers offered for SmartMedia and CompactFlash are available for Memory Sticks.

Mini hard disks: IBM has been a leader in offering Microdrives, tiny hard disks that
have storage capacities as high as 1GB or more. Microdrives fit in a CompactFlash slot.
FireWire connector
USB 2.0 connector
Figure A-1

Opening an Image from Your Digital Camera
751
CompactFlash is a registered trademark of San Disk Corporation.
Because a Microdrive is powered by the device that’s using it, not all digital cameras support the
drives. Any laptop or desktop computer that can accept CompactFlash cards can read Microdrives.

Recordable/rewritable CDs: Sony’s nomadic search for the best digital camera media
has led it to this novel solution, which uses 3-inch-diameter recordable CD (CD-R) and
rewritable CD (CD-RW) media that can store 158MB of information. Although cameras
using this option are a little bulkier, mini-CDs are a convenient, permanent (or semi-
permanent) storage medium that any computer with a CD-ROM drive can read.

Floppy disks: Chalk up another option for Sony, which has offered floppy disk storage
for several of its cameras. Floppies are best suited for low-resolution cameras because
they only hold 1.44MB — not a whole lot of pictures. On the plus side, you can access
these digital photos by using any computer equipped with a floppy drive, which
includes virtually all Windows PCs (but a dwindling number of Macs, which are no
longer furnished with a floppy drive right out of the box).

xD-Picture cards: Smallest of the memory cards, with lower capacity than
CompactFlash or Secure Digital cards.
Other media
A few other types of media have been tried with digital cameras, but have fallen by the way-
side as less expensive and more convenient options have become available. These include the
Imation SuperDisk (a sort of Iomega Zip disk wannabe) and the Iomega Clik disk. Iomega is
Figure A-2

Appendix A: Working with Digital Cameras and Scanners
752
constantly coming up with new storage products and new names for their old products (the
latest being PocketZip and HipZip), so expect to see at least a few digital cameras with some
of these nonstandard storage media in the future.
Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
The following sections summarize what you need to do to transfer images from your camera
to your computer.
You may need to consult your camera’s manual to account for any differences from these
general instructions.
▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Making a direct connection
Most digital cameras allow you to transfer images using connectors such as USB, FireWire
(IEEE-1394), iLink, or a wireless connection. To transfer images by using your camera’s direct-
connection cable, follow these steps:
1.
Make sure that you’ve installed the
software furnished with your camera
and then turn off the camera.
Some cameras come with stand-alone
image transfer programs. Others use
miniprograms that run within
Photoshop, which you access from the
Photoshop Import menu.
2.
Attach the cable to the camera’s con-
nector, and then plug the other end
into the USB, FireWire, or other port
on your computer.
If you’re taking a lot of digital photo-
graphs, you may consider leaving your
camera’s cord plugged into the computer
at all times.
3.
Turn on the camera.
Your computer’s operating system
detects the camera and loads drivers
(support software) that are needed to
connect to the camera. Many cameras
also leave a permanent “overseer” pro-
gram running in the background that
detects the presence of the camera and
loads the image transfer program
automatically.
4.
If necessary, launch the image trans-
fer program.
Figure A-3 shows an example of an
image transfer program.
If your camera uses a stand-alone pro-
gram, you may find it in your Windows
PC Start menu (under Programs), the
Mac OS Apple menu, or somewhere in
the Mac OS X toolbar. It may also be
listed under Photoshop’s Import menu.
5.
Use the transfer program’s options to
copy the images to your hard disk
and to delete images from your
camera’s built-in storage.
6.
Close the transfer program.
You can now load the images directly
into Photoshop from your hard disk
drive.
Some digital models place a Camera
option in Photoshop’s File➪Open dialog
box. If your camera makes itself accessible
from Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder,
the camera may appear to your operating
system as if it were just another device. In
that case, you can simply drag and drop
files from your camera to your hard disk.

▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼
Transferring from removable storage
The most common removable storage options are cards like Secure Digital and CompactFlash.
You may also use Memory Sticks. Whichever removable option you choose to transfer images,
just follow these steps:
Figure A-3
1.
Make sure that you’ve installed the
software your computer needs to sup-
port the card reader or other device.
Newer versions of the Windows and
Mac operating systems detect a new
device the first time it is plugged in.
Your OS may install the support soft-
ware automatically, or ask for a disk
supplied by the device vendor that
contains the necessary drivers.
Although you can often access remov-
able storage as if it were another disk
drive on your computer (see Figure A-4
for an example of a card reader), many
cameras are furnished with transfer
programs that streamline the process
of copying the files from the media and
removing old files. Install this transfer
program separately, if needed.
There may also be a program that runs
within Photoshop, which you access
from the Photoshop Import menu.
2.
Insert the media into the reader
device.
Your computer detects the media auto-
matically and launches a file transfer
program provided by your camera
vendor.

Preparing to Scan
Sometimes the best way to use Photoshop is not to use it at all! When it comes to using your
scanner, you may discover that you can do lots of things when you prepare a scan that will
save you hours of work later in Photoshop. To make sure that you’re on the right track before
you ever slap down an original on the scanner bed, heed the following tips:

Start with good originals: A scanner can’t capture information that isn’t there, so make
sure that you’re using the best, sharpest original available. If you have a choice between
a 4-x-6-inch print and an 8-x-10-inch print, choose the larger size. Although there’s a
point of diminishing returns (a really big print may only show really big grain or dye
clumps), a larger original often contains more information.
Scanning large images (especially at high resolutions) makes the scanning process take
longer. Also, bigger image files take up a lot of space. Bigger is better, but only up to a point.
Always use the sharpest, clearest original. Avoid using faxed or photocopied versions of
photos or text.

Familiarize yourself with your scanner’s software: Find out corrections that you can
make in the scanner (instead of in Photoshop). Your scanner can often do a better job
at tasks (such as adjusting for brightness/contrast, some color correction, and scaling)
because the scanner is working with the “original” information.
Figure A-4
You can also simply open the media
from Windows Explorer or the
Macintosh Finder just as you do any
other storage device.
3.
Copy the images to your hard disk.
Use either the transfer program’s
options or your operating system’s file
copying procedures to move the
images to the folders where you want
to store them.
4.
Send the original copies on the
removable media to the Recycle Bin
or Trash.

Image Scanning Essentials
755
Make your major adjustments with the scanner, and then use Photoshop to fine-tune your
results.

Set up your scanner properly: If this is the first time you’re using your scanner, you
need to make sure that you’ve set it up properly. Installation usually involves two steps:
 Adding the support software or drivers that let your computer talk to the scanner
 Installing the acquisition software that performs the actual image capture

Follow the vendor’s instructions carefully: Some vendors ask you to install the scan-
ner’s software before plugging in the scanner. Others order the setup procedure a little
differenly. Doing these steps in the wrong order won’t hurt anything, but may waste
some of your time when you have to do them over.

Perform some maintenance: Make sure that your scanner glass is clean. You’d be sur-
prised how sharp almost invisible dust spots on the glass can be when scanned. Follow
the scanner vendor’s instructions for cleaning the glass and dry it thoroughly before
positioning an original. Color prints, in particular, contain dyes that can be harmed by
wetness or the chemicals in glass cleaners.
Image Scanning Essentials
After you’ve properly prepared your scanner, set up the software, and so on (see the preced-
ing section), you’re ready to scan your image.
Image scanning options
As with digital cameras, you may have some choices in your method for acquiring an image.
Indeed, some scanners have three or four different options for grabbing pixels. Here are some
of the most common:

One-touch panel: Most scanners these days have one-touch keys that automatically
scan an image to a particular destination, such as an image editor (like Photoshop) or
your printer (in “photocopier” mode). Press the right button, and you’re off. Frequently,
this action launches a one-touch panel on your computer, with limited options that save
you the trouble of manually making choices. Use this stand-alone mode when you’re in
a hurry and don’t need a lot of control over your scan.

Simplified interface: Many scanners offer a simplified interface with only a few con-
trols, such as scan area selection, scaling, resolution, and perhaps some brightness and
contrast controls. These interfaces are great for beginners, and often are available as
both a stand-alone program and a Photoshop Import menu option.

All-business interface: A more advanced interface has lots of controls, zoomed pre-
views, complex brightness/contrast features, color correction features, and other
options. Available as stand-alone programs, these interfaces make good day-to-day
choices for use within Photoshop and are accessible from the Import menu.

Graphics pro interface: (See Figure A-5.) A few more-expensive scanners have an inter-
face that graphics professionals will love, including niceties such as mini-densitometer
features, extensive correction of color and tonal curves, and other sophisticated
options. If you need this choice, you’ll know it, and you won’t want to live without it.

Scanning an image
To grab your image, follow these steps:
Figure A-5
1.
Launch your scanner’s acquisition
software, either as a stand-alone pro-
gram or, preferably, from within
Photoshop by choosing File➪Import.
2.
Place the original face down on the
scanner glass.
Make sure that the image is oriented
square with the guide marks at the top,
bottom, or sides of the scanner.
If the original is small, place it in the
center of the scanner where the light
tends to be more even. Don’t worry too
much if it is slightly crooked, because
you can easily straighten the image
using the cropping tool. See Book II,
Chapter 1.
If the image is too large to fit on the
scanning bed, you can scan the image
in two pieces and then connect them
using Photoshop. Simply create a new
file equal to the total size of the image.
With the Move tool, drag both pieces
onto this new canvas. Match up the
seam and use the retouching tools,
such as the Clone Stamp tool, the
Healing Brush tool, and so on, to touch
up any flaws between the two pieces.
3.
Click the Prescan or Preview button
in the software to see a preview of the
original.
You may need to choose whether your
original is line art, grayscale, or full
color, or the scanner may identify the
type for you automatically.
4.
Set the scan boundaries.
Your software may preselect the area
for the final scan, or you may want to
use its selection tools to set the scan
boundaries yourself.
5.
Apply any correction, sizing, or scal-
ing controls you want to use.
Follow the vendor’s instructions
carefully.

Mastering the Controls
757
Mastering the Controls
Even the most simple scanner interfaces may have a bewildering array of controls for the
beginner. Your first step should be to read the manual furnished with your scanner, whether
it’s a printed booklet or a glorified Help system copied to your hard disk. Scan the text until
you understand the following controls:

Brightness/Contrast: An adjustment for the relative darkness of an image and the
number of tones available. (See also Book VIII, Chapter 1.)

Gamma: A control that allows you to compensate for the tendency of devices (such as
computer displays and scanners) to represent tones in a non-linear way. You can even
out bumps with the gamma control.

Color Correction: Controls that let you keep your color accurate. (See also Book VIII,
Chapter 1.)

Bit Depth Selection: The number of bits per pixels. Scanners scan in RGB color that is
comprised of three channels per pixel. Therefore, a 36-bit scanner has a color depth of 12
bits per channel and a 2-bit scanner has a color depth of 14 bits per channel. Bit depth is
also used in reference to the number of colors or tones captured by a scan. Black-and-
white images may be captured using 8 bits of information (256 different gray tones),
whereas color images are captured using at least 24 bits of data (16.8 million colors).

White Point and Black Point Adjustments: These controls let you tell the scanner
which parts of your subject are the brightest and darkest areas, respectively, that
contain detail.

Histograms: These are charts that show you how many tones at each brightness level
appear in an image. You can use them as tools for adjusting brightness and contrast.
(See also Book VIII, Chapter 1.)

Sharpening: Scanners can presharpen images for you, although in most cases it’s more
productive to carry out this step in Photoshop. (See also Book VII, Chapter 1.)

Descreening: Scanners can remove halftone screens with some success, but you gain
flexibility when you do this in Photoshop. (See also Book VII, Chapter 1.)

ICC Profile Management: This control lets you specify the color characteristics of your
devices. (See also Book II, Chapter 3.)

Resolution: This is one of the most important controls, as well as the one that is most
often mishandled by scanning neophytes. Resolution is the amount of image detail cap-
tured by the scanner, measured in samples per inch (spi), but usually (and inaccurately)
referred to as pixels per inch (ppi) or dots per inch (dpi).
6.
Choose a destination for the scan
(printer, e-mail, image editor)
if appropriate and/or select a
resolution.
Resolution is the number of samples
per inch (spi), often referred to as
pixels per inch (ppi) or dots per inch
(dpi) with less-than-perfect accuracy.
Choosing the proper resolution is
extremely important, so if you’re a little
fuzzy on the concept of resolution, be
sure and see Book II, Chapter 1.

Surprisingly, with resolution, more is not always better. Use too high a setting, and you
end up with needlessly large file sizes. Use too low a setting, and you wind up with not
enough detail. Although Photoshop allows you to reduce the size of large images
(through a process called resampling), you’ll always lose a little (or a lot) of quality when
you do this. Using the correct resolution for your applications, from Web display to desk-
top printing to professional color reproduction, is essential to Photoshop success. Check
out Book II, Chapter 1; Book IX, Chapter 2; and Book X, Chapter 2, for more information.
Cleaning Up Your Digital Image
After you import your digital photo and load it into Photoshop, you’ll probably want to per-
form some simple clean-up tasks. In Table A-1, I show you what you need to do and where in
this book you’ll find instructions on how to perform these tasks.
Making even your initial changes on a copy of the original is always a good idea so that you can
return to the original photo if you change your mind or decide to make some different changes.
Digital-camera photos are subject to variations in lighting conditions, whereas scanners
always use the same light source that changes only very slowly as the scanner ages. Digital-
camera pictures are sometimes high in contrast or lack sharpness, two defects attributable to
their sensors. Scanners, on the other hand, are subject to the vagaries of your original (bad
high-contrast, off-color originals produce bad scans) but are flexible in terms of how much
contrast is applied or resolution brought to bear for a given scan.
You can also soften grain and minimize dust and scratches with several of the Photoshop
blurring effects, including the amazing Dust & Scratches filter that looks specifically for
anomalous shapes that may be photo dust bunnies in disguise. Read about filters and
restoration in Books VII and VIII.

f you’ve already accessed the Tools palette, or, as most
Photoshop users call it, the Toolbox, then you know how
daunting it seems. If you haven’t had a chance to open up 
the Tools palette, all you need to do is choose Window➪Tools.
The Toolbox is divided into three basic sections — the tools,
the color swatches, and the icons for masking modes and view-
ing options, which I cover in Book I. In this appendix, I created
a visual reference that divides the tools logically by activity.
As you maneuver through Photoshop (and this book), you can
always flip to Appendix B and get information at a glance. You
can find


The keyboard shortcut for each tool

A cross-reference to the book and chapter that covers
the tool in detail
To select a tool, simply point and click or use keyboard short-
cuts. For example, to select the Move tool, press V. To select
the Brush tool, press B. And to select the Pencil tool, which
shares the flyout menu with the Brush tool, press Shift+B.
As a general rule, you can access a hidden tool by pressing
Shift along with the keyboard letter of the visible tool. You
can also (usually) Alt+click (Option+click on the Mac) a
tool to cycle through all the tools hidden beneath it. Some
of the tools on the Marquee and Pen flyout menus aren’t
accessible using this method.
