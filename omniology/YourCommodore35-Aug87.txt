The law currently states that the
moment a program is written then the
copyright belongs to the author. The
NSR will allow a programmer to gain a
certiﬁcate of resistrat ion as soon as he
sends a copy o f his program to the
register. On receipt of a program in

The author will receive a Certiﬁcate of
Registration and the contents of the

David's b ri e f i s  t o  provide

functions is to advice disabled users
what aids and adaptions are available,
where they may be purchased. and
how to  obtain assistance from the
DHSS o r  other organisations t o
procure them. To  accomplish this
David needs information fr o m
manufacturers and retailers o f  this
type of equipment as well as feedback
from users of these items.
Even people with a severe physical
disability can use computers quite
extensively and not least tor things
such a s  w o r d  processing a n d
communications. Sometimes special
keyboards or other input devices are
required but in many cases only small
aids are required which can make
routine tasks like changing ﬂoppy
disks or feeding paper into a printer
inﬁnitely less frustrating.
If you (or your company) have
items which may be of help to disabled
computer users or i f you have ever
used any such devices please contact
the ICPUG Disability Liaison Ofﬁcer.
Mr. David Bate. Literature and ﬁrst
hand user information are always
needed a n d  welcome, b u t actual
samples o f an aid or adaption are
particularly useful as these may be
evaluated in actual use, Any samples
will be returned if requested.
This new ICPUG aims to help the

I f  you hale shooting aliens ant/feel that you need
something more intellectual to stimulate your grey
matter then look over tins selection of games.
As adventure games become ever more sophisticated, it
seems that calling them adventures just isn't good enough
any longer. Infocom call their games interactive ﬁction.
Broderbund have just released the electronic novel - or
rather three of them. So just what do these games have to
offer that warrant them being called something different?
Well to start with, they are all disk-based. This means
that the stories can be bigger and better than tape-only
games but it should be noted that American companies don't
go in for text compression like, say. Level 9. But there again.
these games take up three or four sides of disk.
Then there's the packaging. This is one area where the
Yanks leave the Brits standing. You are just itching to take
the boxes off the shelves and have a look inside them. As a
bonus, it also makes the games that much harder to pirate.
Backing up the disks is easy - indeed, they even suggest that
you do so but it is not worth your while running off an extra
copy for your friend as she, or he, needs all the extra bits and
pieces in order to play. In the case of Electronic Novels, you
get a 100 page hardback book containing details of storvline,
illustrations, space for maps and summaries of the game's
commands.
The games themselves are superbly constructed. The

descriptions are both lengthy and atmospheric. Smells and
sounds abound, things that no illustration can ever depict.
The puzzles too are both original and logical and succeed in
drawing you into the story. The games feature an excellent
and sophisticated parser and other characters in the plot
exhibit a fair degree of independence.

MIND WHEEL
The second electronic novel. Mindwheel. is a  strange
mixture of science ﬁction and fantasy. Civilisation in The
Federated Nations is collapsing. Tourists are being ripped
apart by packs of wild dogs. Rioting and looting in the
streets is rife. A leak is discovered in a nerve gas stockpile.
The apocalypse seems inevitable.
Only one man understands exactly what is going on.
Doctor Virgil is looking for a volunteer to travel through
time in order to retrieve the Wheel of Wisdom.
Doctor Virgil has been researching into neuro-matrix
mind travel. By telepathically journeying through four
different minds, you (for how could you fail to volunteer)
can be transported to the Cave Master, owner of The Wheel,
at the very Dawn of Time.
You remember the Doctor throwing a switch in his
laboratory, but your next awareness is that of being in centre
stage, accompanied by a backing group and in front of
several thousand screaming fans. You are in the mind of
Bobby Clemon, assassinated rock star. A huge video screen
above your head is showing close-ups of your death. A fan
tries to climb up on stage and reach you but is diverted by a
bulky bodyguard.
Although you have never been aware of any musical
talent in your previous existence, the crowd obviously expect
you to sing and, to your surprise, you soon ﬁnd yourself
playing the keyboards with words pouring out o f your
mouth. Not your own words, mind, but you are convinced of
their signiﬁcance to your future journey.
Backstage, a woman urges you to follow her, and you do
so, up a winding staircase. A winged woman in a cage blocks
your path until you have successfully answered a riddle.
Only then are you free to enter a castle that lies beyond,
R E V I E W S
The castle belongs to The Generalissimo, one of the most
feared dictators of his time and the second of your four
minds. Eventually executed for war crimes, his domain
includes such problems as passing a guard, half of stone. half
human, and answering yet another riddle. You go on to
discover a tribe of animal-headed children.
There are yet two minds left for you to discover. A poet,
composer of your culture's great epics and Dr Eva Fein, a
sort of female Einstein who specialises in the matter of
nature and was once a schoolmate of The Generalissimo...
the plot of Mindwheel can best be summed up as weird, but
the game is no less fascinating for that -even if haven't got a
clue what is going on.

The third of this month's Electronic Novels is unashamed
science ﬁction. The planet Borg, hidden in the deep recesses
of the outer tentacles of the Slug Nebula, is the home of the
Lau people. It is also a haven for evil.
Every sort of misﬁt, criminal and thug seems to gravitate
towards Borg at some stage in their career. The planet is

supposed to be a centre of intergalactic slave trading but this
tends to be a cover for other criminal activities. Corruption
is rife. Everybody is out to look after number one. As a
Breaker, you ﬁt admirably into the background.
There is a general air of panic around the bar where you
are quietly getting drunk. The constellation Garbo seems to
be disappearing and tradition has it that when this happens,
the planet will either be destroyed o r saved. Are you
interested or do you order another drink?
As there is not much of a game in the latter option, you
immerse yourself in the role of hero yet again. The game
begins with you trying to escape from the clutches of a Gak
patrol that has just entered the bar. This is done with the aid
of some friends although you are unsure as to how far you
can trust them. You seek temporary refuge in the cellars
below the inn.
Here you ﬁnd a strange red ball that seems reluctant to be
picked up. There is also a newspaper cutting that should
prove useful to you later on when you practise the ignoble
arts of torture and interrogation. You soon discover that you
are being followed by Nate Grey, although you don't have a
clue why. Of more immediate concern to you is how much
gold it costs to persuade a Gak to look the other way for a
few minutes.
All three games work well because they are proper stories
not a  collection o f  loosely associated problems. The
atmosphere within the game is superbly built up and the only
major criticism that 1 can come up with is one that can't be

with the 1541 not being exactly renowned for its speed•

It was inevitable that all the hype surrounding the General
Election would spawn a computer game spin-off. It was also
inevitable that it would be awful.

Daniel Pauls. The object of the game is to move your party
leader, or his head anyways around the game screens.

You do this by asking for support or bribing with gifts or
incentives (manifestoes, knighthoods, shares and gossip) in
order to win 101 of the 199 votes available.
Once you've gained the support of one of the computer -
controlled characters you can order them to either help you
(i.e. follow you around), canvass another character on your
behalf or slur another character or party leader. Slurring is
essential if you're going to win the election as it weakens the
target until they ﬁnally disappear leaving only a banana
skin.
As the game proceeds you'll notice that even your own
supporters will need canvassing to keep them in line, that 101
votes is almost impossible to get, you'll be bored silly before
you collect 50votes- and the other party leaders come back
even when they've been destroyed.
Maybe by the next Election someone somewhere will
have written a decent Election game.

TEMPLE OF TERROR
The Fighting Fantasy books by  Steve Jackson and Ian
Livingstone are far  and away the best-selling children's
books in this country. It's therefore a natural progression to
translate them to computer format.
The idea behind the books is that as you follow the story.
you are often presented w it h  a  number o f  choices.
Depending on your choice, you are referred to numbered
paragraphs which in turn continue the story and lead to
further choices. The action includes combat sequences
which can be resolved by rolling dice.

treasures ﬁrst. It might complete his mastery of the dark
arts...As is usual in this type of game, you are the only one
foolhardy enough to volunteer.
Frankly the game is dreadful. Little or no atmostphere is
created. The graphics are nothing special. The parser is
crude by modern standards and there are several spelling
mistakes which give the whole thing an amateurish feel.
What is worse is that US Gold expect you to fork out
nearly ten quid for the game. Fine if it were worth it but
object to paying even a budget price for this. Incidentally this
is no reﬂection on Jackson and Livingstone. The books are
excellent value for money. Go and buy a few of them instead.

THE SHADOWS OF MORDOR
If you think  hobbits are habit-forming and y ou have
nightmares about OrCS, balrogs and ring wraithes then you'll
have already solved The Hobbit and the ﬁrst part of Lord of
the Rings. The Shadows of Mordor continues this epic tale in
part two of the three game series.
As in part one you control hairy hobbit heroes Sam and
Frodo as they continue their quest to destroy the ring of
power that controls and enslaves all others. As the game
begins Frodo and Sam have left their companions on an
island in the middle of a lake and have secretly gone on alone
to continue their quest. Their objective is  to cross the
desolate wastelands and survive the trek through the evil
mountains that surround Sauron's homeland.
The Shadows of Nlordor is a traditional adventure with a
vocabulary of over 800 words. Unlike the ﬁrst game and,
indeed. The Hobbit. this game is mainly text with only a few
crude graphic screens to illustrate Tolkein's Middle Earth.
Consequently it relies heavily on its text descriptions and
improved interaction with the other characters. Now you
can give Sam a whole string of commands instead of entering
them one at a time. Whether he carries them out or not is
another matter and depends on his state o f  health and
hunger. Similarly, you could take the role of Sam and order
Frodo instead or if you're feeling brave you could control
both directly and swap between them using the Become...
command. Obviously, this  adds dramatically t o  y our
problems and so its best to allow the computer to take one or
the other until you know your way around.
The game is supplied in a massive box containing the
second book in the series that may provide some useful tips
and, of COUNe a map of the area. The game does differ from
the book, but only to provide a better game rather than an
Adrian Mole style multiple-choice story.
Unlike the ﬁrst game that lacked dynamism because of
the book's plot the action really hots up as the end of the
quest is at last in sight (although you'll have to wait until part
three to have at last the chance to destroy The Ring in the
Crack of Doom).
If you've played Lord of the Rings then you'll notice that
the emphasis of this game is towards adventuring, which
should please Tolkien fans. Perhaps the last part of Lord of
the Rings will be text only?

BUREAUCRACY
R E V I E W S
What could possibly go wrong? You've just landed a great
job at the Happitec corporation, moved to a new town. and
are about to leave on a two week trip to Paris which is being
paid for by your new employer. What could go wrong?
Everything! Your bank refuses to accept Your change of
address form and won't send you another one, Happitec has
sent your tickets to your old address where the new owner
has just discovered the dry rot and has decided to forward
your post to the bank instead and you have to be at the
airport this afternoon! This could only happen in a Douglas
Adams story that just happens to be part of an Infocom
adventure called Bureaucracy.
This dynamic combination has already produced the
adventure version of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
This time you must battle through a sea of red tape.
The game disk is accompanied by the usual high quality
Infocom packaging that includes a letter from Happitec the
ﬁrst issue of Popular magazine and an application form for
the Beezer credit card. This form is an example of the
ﬁctitous but all-too-familiar Douglas Adams bureaucracy
that you'll have to face in the game as it consists of an
original and two carbon copies which have different
questions and, more important, conditions o f use. For
example. on the original you agree to pay any charges
against your account, but on the copies you agree not to use
the card to buy anything and to let Beezer sign your name for
anything anywhere leaving you to pay the bill!
Unfortunately, you can't start playing the game until
you've ﬁlled in another on-screen registration form that
prompts you for answers such as your name, address,
girlfriend's name, job before the last one and previous
girlfriend. This information is then used to 'personalise' the
game and also clutter up your answer phone with messages
to send your blood pressure soaring. If your blood pressure
gets too high then you lose the game as you blow your top.
However, that's going to be easier than solving the game and
dealing with unwanted salesmen. bank tellers that direct you
to closed counters, people who are never in although you can
hear them when you phone, a fascist parrot, an old lady with
a shotgun and a waitress in a restaurant who takes your
order (burger. what type?. fries or jacket potatoes. salad.
which dressing etc. etc.) then goes off duty leaving you to
repeat the order — only to be brought the exact opposite.
This may sound annoying - and i t is - but it's also
incredibly funny and a challenging sequel to the legendary
HitchHikers Guide. Unfortunately, as if part of the plot, the
game is only available on machines supporting 128K so C64
owners can't play it. Now you've got no excuse not to get an
Amiga or a C128. If that fails ﬁnd a friend with one, they'll
need the help!

Here's your chance to do a bit of detective work and brush
up on geography at the same time , Carmen Sandiego is the
leader of a gang of art thieves, international terrorists and
general ne'er-do-wells.
Your mission starts with a telex from Interpol giving
details of a nationally important art treasure that has just
been lifted. Immediately jetting off to the scene of the crime.
you ﬁnd that there are three possible places to in% estigate.
These will give you clues as to the next stop on the thief's
itinerary. Each investigation takes time though and you only
have until the end of the week to catch up with your suspect.
When you think that you know where her or she has ﬂown
to, you can go and catch a plane. Remember that plane
journeys and sleeping also eat away at your available hours.
As well as following your suspect. you also have to make
a positive identiﬁcation and get the necessary arrest warrant
issued. As you investigate. you will pick up clues as to the
personal habits of your adversary and these can be fed into
the Interpol computer. For example. you may ﬁnd that there
are two men who have tattoos and black hair b u t only one
of them plays croquet.
The clues range from the simple to the impossible - but
help is at hand. Accompanying the package is a World
Almanac - nearly 1000 pages of closely packed information
and it is from here that you are supposed to ﬁnd out your
answers. For example. which nation has stamps as its major
export or even where Kigali or Moroni are. Your clues
include currency, ﬂags, industries, provinces and famous
landmarks.
When you catch up with a thief, assuming you have a
warrant, the criminal is arrested and your record updated.
Solve enough cases and you earn promotion. The game is
slickly presented - all menu-driven with some nice cartoon
graphics. M y  only real grumble is that extracting the
information from the Yearbook is not particularly easy.
Perhaps a database on disk could have been included
instead, Even so. the format works well and should appeal to
anyone revising f o r  0-Level geography. Perhaps
Broderbund may like to consider a 'Where in Britain...'

Facing Up To
Printers
ee whiz! I wish I could afford a
G
printer but the thought of an extra 00
or more for an interface really puts me
off. Although Supra's G-Wiz is not
dirt cheap it certainly saves on what
you could be paying. After all what's
.00 on the cost of a printer?
Any serious computer user will
always reach a point where they wish
they had access to a printer. For many
this means dashing out to buy one of
the Commodore range of machines as
soon as funds permit. A Commodore
printer is like a Chinese meal, you soon
wish you had settled for something
more ﬁlling and once again you wish
you had a printer!
The answer is not to dash out to the
shops but to sit and think for a while.
Before long you realise that there are
better printers on the market but how
can they be hooked up to the CM?
Nearly all of the possible candidates
are parallel printers but the C64 only
supports serial connection. Th e
answer to this problem involves more
expense: b u y  a  serial/parallel
interface.
The thought o f more codes and
switches could strike fear into the heart
of the bravest programmer but the
interface is probably one of the most
user friendly add-ons available. G-Wiz
is certainly that.
Open the Box
The G- Wi z  interface i s  a  b o x
measuring 145mm x 90mm x 25mm.
Three cables from the main unit
terminate in suitable connectors for
the printer, the serial port on the C64
and a cassette port connector which
taps o f f  a  power supply fo r  the
interface. D o n 't worry the power
I f  you're bored with Commodore's OIt'n product, a printer
interface may be what you need. We look at one of the
options.
By Eric Doyle
connector still allows you to plug the
cassette recorder in.
There are two basic modes for
accessing your printer through this
device. First and most fearsome is the
transparent mode. In this case you can
use the printer as a normal printer for
use with software which has all of the
necessary conversion software built in.
It is also necessary for the correct
operation of some advanced graphics
modes which certain printers possess.
The second and more usual mode is
1525 emulation. This is an example of
a double bluff. The C64 thinks it is
talking to a Commodore VIC 1525
printer and the printer thinks i t is
listening to any old computer. The
unit's in-built emulator translates the
Commodore ASCII characters into
Standard ASCII and the normal ﬁle
opening and commands which are
only addressable to a 1525 may be
used. More than this, the special codes
for speciﬁc printer features such as
italic, condensed, underline a n d
super/subscript modes can still be
sent.
The unit i s  designed t o  give
compatibility with a  wide range o f
printers: Star, Epson, Okidata, Smith
Corona Fastext 80, Pro-Writer, NEC.
Panasonic amongst others. Th e
problem with such a selection is that
the interface has to be that much more
versatile. Some printers need line
feeds, other have them built in, you
may want the printer as Device 4 or you
may prefer Device 5. To combat this
there is a bank of eight switches on the
rear of the interface. A  checklist o f
printers and corresponding switch
settings is given on the unit itself as
well as in the comprehensive 90 page
manual.
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987

Peculiar Commands
Another advantage of the G-Wiz is its
ability t o  convert t h e  peculiar
commands in PRINT statements into
recognisable codes when printing out
listings. Fo r example, instead o f a
reversed heart for clearing the screen
the listing would show the following:
[CLR]. In this way the interface solves
a lot of the problems inherent with the
standard Commodore printer's
method of displaying listings.
The best test o f  an interface is
whether you realise it's there or not, In
tests I found that I could forget about
the printer most of the time but the one
time it needed attention I was glad of
it! When using the Superscript word
processor I  was able to  send the
command 'LOCK* which means that
the interface is effectively switched to
transparent mode. This means that I
can tell the program that I'm using a
particular printer and use all of the
facilities to  produce a  professional
look to my documents.
The only problem with locking up
the unit is that it can only be unlocked
by unplugging the cassette interface
and then plugging it back in. I f  the
computer is powered up at the time,
clumsy hands could cause a short and
damage the computer. I would suggest
that the ﬁrst thing to do is to ﬁt an
on/off switch on the power supply
cable to overcome this danger.
G-Wiz is a superb unit which does
all that I need, the manual is not only
clear but also includes hints and tips
which I have not found anywhere else.
At such a reasonable price it should
prove a  good investment fo r your
current printer, and any you may
upgrade to in the future.

l'here is a vast horde of C64 graphics packages and hardware
add-ons. One of the best is Rainbird's recent Art Studio.
This has now been extended to form the Advanced Ar t
Studio and sold with the original in the same pack with two
manuals and two tapes or disks.
The original Art Studio is an easy-to-use, pull-down
menu driven package that allows you to draw shapes, select
colours, deﬁne and alter windows and paint in a variety of
user-deﬁnable brushes without taking your eyes off your
creation.
Each option is accessed through a series of pull-down
menus that are listed in a bar that occupies the top two lines
of the screen (these lines can still be used as the screen can be
scrolled down to reveal them).
From the Shapes menu you can select for individual
points, straight lines, rectangles, triangles, circles and rays.
The position and size of the shape is displayed before you
commit it to screen. These shapes can then be magniﬁed 2,4
or 8 times to add ﬁne detail, ﬁlled with colour and mixed
with nine different text sizes that can be custom designed
with a font editor.
Although the Art Studio is fast and easy to use it does
have its limitations with the main one being the use of

colour. Although graphics can be drawn in high-resolution
mode, pixel by pixel, colour can only be applied in attribute
areas one character in size. It 'smudges' badly if two different
ink colours are too close together. The results are highly
detailed but bland. The Advanced Art Studio sets out to put
this right by operating in multi-colour mode in which up to
three ink colours can share a 4 x 8 colour cell with a standard
background colour.
Colours for inks are selected from the colour menu that
can also be used to establish priorities should the three ink
colour limit be exceeded. Then the top three colours in the
priority list are displayed. You can also list colours in a
second list that should be excluded from operations such as
paint or clear. For example. if you draw a rough sketch in
white and then mess up the rest of the drawing you could
exclude white, then clear a window (that could be set to the
full screen), and restore your original white outline.
As in the original Art Studio you can deﬁne the patterns
that can form the Studio's brush hut with a lot more scope.
In the Advanced Art Studio the brush can be as large as 12 x
16 pixels and contain three ink colours. These can then be
used as a normal brush and modiﬁed by the exclusion
command that can take out one or more colours and so

change the pattern. O f course, the same is also true of ﬁll
patterns that can be used to create a crowd scene from a
single pattern in under a minute!
Once you've created your elements using brushes or
shapes you can deﬁne them as a window and then save them
to tape and disk to form a picture library. This can be used
later to produce pictures from ready made clip art.
Other minor changes include the facility to change the ﬁll
and pattern cursors to represent what they will do to your
screen. You can also print text right to left and upwards as
well as left to right and downwards. Unfortunately, not all
the changes arc for the best. Text can be written on the screen

the original Ar t Studio offered single, double and treble

except that standard character set is now too big. Luckily.
there's still a font editor so you can edit it back to the size it
was before it was 'improved'.
Both versions of the Art Studio are quick and simple to

excellent value under .t.:25 for both.

The 4mx Mouse package
contains a three button
mouse and a disk
containing Stop Press
packed full of fonts and
graphics that allow you to
produce professional
looking newspapers,
posters and leaﬂets using
your C64.
The package uses the
Wimp system (Windows,
Icons, Menus and Pointers)
that was pioneered on
machines like the Mac.
to allow you to easily mix
text in a variety of
different typefaces and
'run it around graphic
shapes such as
rectangles,
circles
triangles
as well as a

menus are all part of this

dually works I  used the
package to create this
article.

by a list of

and

functions or can be placed
in a speciﬁc area by
moving the window over
the preview screen of the
full page.
When you've selected
the area you wish to work
on you can use the other
functions to create, paint
and ﬁl l  shapes created
from lines, rectangles and
circles, enter text in any
of the SO different fonts

a window, the screen,
or the full page on a
lariely of supported
printers.
it Stop Press page is
stored on disk as a bit
pattern which can cause
problems particularly
when your entering text.
Once you've entered a line
it is "written" to the page
and cannot be edited as
you could in a normal
word processor. This is
ﬁne i f  you're only writing
headlines or picture
captions but for a sizable
block of text, such as this
article, it is best to write
It on a word processor (I
used PaperClip) and then
load the ﬁnished document
into Stop Press and onto
your page.
The text to be loaded
in must be stored in PET
45CII and so you should
check your word processor
has this option. Rost do,
but it's best to check
before you write the text.
4s the text is loaded from
disk it will ﬂow onto the
screen until eitheP you
pause it or it ﬁlls the
ork area. When it's paused
ou can either scroll down
and restart it straight
away or change the font,
letter size, margins or

run in auto ﬂow around
any shape (Not many
newspapers can do that?).
The text handler is
only half the story as to
produce a professional
looking paper or leaﬂet
it's best to mix the text
with graphics that are
either created by you or
loaded in from Stop
Press's 150k of clip art.
Some examples of the
animals, characters and
objects included in this
clip art library litter
these pages as examples of
how they can be mixed to
produce some surprising
results.
You can add to this
library of artwork by
saving any
deﬁned
window which
could be either a graphic
that you've created or an
often used heading such as
a newsletters title.
Finally, you can edit
your creation by cutting
and pasting blocks of it
as well as magnifying any
pall of the page to alter a
single pixel.

and so Stop
Press is
also
supplied
seperately
at about
half the standard price.
I have only one major
critiscm about the package
and that involves the
loading of new fonts and
ut outs. These added
graphics are essential but
must be loaded by typing
in the correct name
(including capitals). There
are directory options but
you must then remember
exactly what you want to
load in. The result is
somewhat unfriendly when
compared to packages like
Print Shop that allows you
o load a clip art by
selecting it from the
'rectory.
Comparisons are bound
to be made between Stop
Press and programs such
s Print Shop and
ewsroom. 4part from the
ﬁle handling routine I
found that Stop Press
ffered more ﬂexibility
and variety.

Is it the Thought
that Counts?
/
-  it makes the Moonies look rational. I've seen perfect!)
reasonable people turned into drooling ideas processor
fanatics simply because someone's written a few bytes of
code that dignify their stray wafﬂings into some facsimile of
creative thought.
I'm glad I've got that off my chest. In fact, it's really sour
grapes - the damn things just don't work for me. Perhaps I
spend far too much time looking at a monitor screen - it's a
positive relief to go off and scribble my crazed ideas on the
back of bus tickets.
These also have the added advantage of  being easily
loseable, whereas ideas processors enable you to save it all
on disk, with the result that you may end up having to reread
it sometime. Shudder.
Not so Bad Really
In fact Thinking Cap is a pleasant inoffensive little program.
Honestly, I'm not incapable of admiring this sort of software
- it just doesn't help me generate ideas.
For those who haven't brushed up against the creature,
an ideas processor is a sort of struct tired notepad. It's used to
set up an outline for a task such as a business plan, a speech
or a magazine article.
You may enter your thoughts as topics in any order, and
enter further thoughts as sub-topics of these, further ones as
sub-sub-topics ad inﬁnittan (or in this case to seven levels of
depth). This means that you can start with a vague idea, and
harden it  up as y ou move t o deeper areas o f  detail.
Hopefully, when you 'pan back' you ﬁnd that you have a
coherent plan laid out.
Friendly Facilities
Thinking Cap provides plenty o f  friendly facilities for
helping the process along. It's pop-up menu driven, with a
Help menu which smooth-scrolls beautifully up from the
foot of the screen.
Broderbung ingeniously lets you use the Shift Lock to
lock this in place on the screen. A full range of editing
facilities is provided, including the ability to Cut, Paste and
Copy from a pop-up menu.
Does Broderbund Software's Thinking Cap
idea processor offer signiﬁcant advantages
compared with the back of an envelope?
By Fin Fahey
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987
31
There are two main program modes. Brainstorm is really
the entry mode. Overview lets you see your ideas as a whole
and allows you ﬁner discrimination with your cutting and
pasting.
Unfortunately, the program is totally keyboard-driven.
This is the sort of software that I feel could beneﬁt from
mouse or joystick control, enabling you to make with the
totally creative concepts while reclining languidly in your
favourite armchair. Instead it's  back t o  the dreary old
function keys.
This may well be your cup of tea - after all if it makes you
feel good, do it. Urn - what else was I going to say? Where's
that old envelope gone?

machine code. It allows you to design a
screen using all o f the Commodore

thoughts o f  cricket, or  so the famous misquotation o f
Tennyson would have us believe. Palace Software have
taken this theory to heart and embedded the theme deep
inside St ifﬂip and Co. After all is not the Orb and Sceptre of
State sy mbolic of this most regal of national pastimes?
Although t h e  main theme is  s et i n  the despotic
atmosphere o f  a  banana r epublic , t h e  tr aditional
atmosphere of a test match best con jurs up the sense of fair
play and gentility that the game demands. Well almost, in
this game you must always remember that when the going
gets tough, even the stiffest upper lip will curl with rage.
Palace are aware that adventures rarely top the software
charts. A s  always. shoot-cm-ups and arcade machine
conversions seem to dominate. As a result of this, Stifﬂip has
been beefed up by the addition of cartoon strip graphics and
a new style of beat-em-up game to lure the reaction game

Viscount Sebaston Stifﬂip and his  three comrades
epitomise all the qualities that prevailed when the Raj •
raging and a nation took tea and cucumber sandwiches whil
awaiting the second innings of the World Wars. Beneath th
veneer o f  sophisticated ennui there were stirrings in t
Republic of Banarnia. Count Chameleon was the head of
benign dictatorship which he described in the followin
way: 'when 7.e peoples ask for ze right to vote, my answer vi
be neinl'
Disatisﬁed with a mere corner of the globe. Chameleon
had a masterplan which would cause the total downfall and
capitulation of the British Empire. Ills scientists were close
to completion of a raygun which would cause the world

Raygun of the SNAFU Corporation but the Rubbertro
Raygun which would neutralise the starch in wing-col

character can now be moved using a simple pop-up icon
menu or one of a multitude of actions may be performed.
'Pie country is teaming with Chameleon's henchmen
who seem t o  have a  grudge against foreigners. These
musclebound mental pigmies wander from location t o
location and woe betide the unfortunate team member who
crosses their path. I f  the character concerned is not under
your immediate control, the relevant character icon gains a
speech bubble with a plea for help. Speed is of the essence if
the victim is to be saved. Quickly selecting that character you
can swing into ' Bill mode and the light screen appears.
There are several elements to a ﬁght but the ﬁrst decision
is whether to continue or  accept the white feather of a
coward and head for a safer place. It would be caddish to ﬂee
and the best option is to enter the fray using one of he other
three options. The most effective of these is a quick jab below
the belt but this is the mark of a bounder and can only be
resorted to three times before the celestial umpire steps in
and sends your character back to the great pavilion in the
sky.
This leaves the right uppercut and left hook as the only
real alternatives. In both cases the power and accuracy of the
punch is measured in the same way'. A rotating boxing glove
gradually increases its speed and power as you concentrate
on keeping an erratically moy ing cross in the centre of the
torgetting screen. When You're quite ready' a quick press on

seriously affect the bounce of a cricket ball.
Stifﬂip's suspicions were aroused when the entire rubber
crop of Banarnia went missing and we join his team at
Banarnia's airport where they are greeted by  General
Moustachic with a demand for airport tax. This is the point
at which you learn how easily the locals can be insulted as the
screen is peppered with bullets to each incorrect response to
the General's demands. Eventually. you ﬁnd the correct
trigger and the adventure begins.
After a little searching You ﬁnd several useful locations,
not least of which is the local bar. The bartender is not very
helpful but once you solve a fairly weighty problem he will
help you all he can.
Each of the main characters can interact with the game
by an ingenious icon system. To change the person currently
under control you use the 'While...' icon. This causes a
'Meanwhile' caption t o  appear and the selected team
member appears in the location where you last left them. The

and the blow is landed. The effectiveness is measured on a
fairground style 'Test Your Strength'. icon at the top left of
the screen.
Of course your opponent doesn't take this lying down.
You have to watch the right hand side of the screen where the
henchman's reaction is monitored. As You concentrate on
whacking him with the hardest punch you can muster, a
boxing glove on a spring bounces even nearer to the crucial
contact point. If the blow is landed before you can react, the
punch is registered on your diminishing strength scale and
you have to start building up your aborted punch from
scratch.
Apart from indulging in ﬁsticuffs. Stifﬂip and C'o, will
meet many complex and subtle problems in their search for
Chameleon. Each person has special capabilities which
means working out who has the sharpest nails for untying
ropes, who has specialist skills with equipment and who
possesses the necessary tools for the job in hand.
Viscount Stiffhp is the team leader though his military
record shows him to be a devout coward. The Germans had
Yon Richtofen -  we had his counterpart Stittlip. the Yellow
Baron.
Little is known o f  the second member of  the team,
Colonel R G Bargie. It is rumoured that he was the recipient
of the noble o
he was called to the Bar. He is also renowned for his belief
that a  salary provides a  means t o  liv e beyond, and
consequent ty h i s  chequebooks a r e  n o w  pr inted o n
rubberised paper.
The only female agent is Palmyra Prim bottom who's not
as straightlaced as she may sound. Her experiences in the
Girl Guides was good perparation for her later work with
the savage tribes of Darkest Surrey Palmyra is a tough
customer b u t  s h e  nev er  forgets  h e r  distinguished
performance in the Guides where she survived the gruelling
deportment classes to become the ﬁrst non-posthumous
recipient of an achievement badge.
Professor Braindeath's achleY ements in  the ﬁeld o f
amnesia research were long forgotten when he started
researches into producing a device to put the middle back
into doughnuts. F o r  the moment the wor k  has been
abandoned in favour of the Banarnian expedition's promise
of thrills, excitement and lot's of sun. The professor's main
claim to fame is that he has been clinically dead for the past
ten years.
Palace have taken great pains to make this an adventure
with a very broad appeal. 1 was hooked from the beginning
but only time will tell if they've been caught in the slips or if
they've succeeded in  making a good contact across the
boundary o f  conventional adventures. Perhaps their
indecision shows through in the co-release of Barbarian - the
Ultimate Warrior which lacks any kind of lasting interest but
has an immediate, it' brutish, appeal. Watch the demos of
Barbarian but come home with Stifﬂip and Co. — the yvry
best of British ingenuity and programming.

T
the cat amongst the pigeons in the
68000 market. It's rather like a Rolk
Royce being offered at a price slightly
higher than the average family saloon.
At E499 +  VAT, the Amiga now
competes favourably with the top end
of the present home computer market.
The only obstacle is the Atari ST and
whether the home buyer will go for a
saying of around EMI). In many ways
the Amiga is superior to the ST but will
people look beyond the price tag?
So. what do you get for your
money? The A500 is an Amiga in every
sense and the inclusion o f the boot
program. Kickstart. in the ROM saves
a few o f  the setting-up headaches
which were part and parcel o f the
earlier A1000. A  few more o f the
teething troubles inherent with the
Workbench software have also been
ironed out with Workbench
The amazing thing about A500 is
its size and weight. Considering there
is a built in disk drive, it is still a very
light unit and takes up just slightly
more space on my workstation than
the Cl28, The ﬁnish i s  the now
standard cream coloured plastic which
seems to be Commodore's industry
standard. A t  least this encourages
cleanliness because the ﬁnish really
does show every speck of grime.
C u t
Although the Amiga is at a cut-down
price, there are no compromises on
the features offered i n  the Amiga
standard as set up by the A1000.1 have
tried every bit of software to hand and
so far nothing has failed to  load.
Perhaps its time that software houses
started t o  i n d i c a te  m e m o r y
requirements f o r  th e i r products
because the future will bring bigger
and better products which may not ﬁt
into the standard memory.
The rear of the machine is reserved
for input and output ports. The only
colour video output i s  fo r  R GB
monitors b u t  a  monochrome
composite output has been tapped off
for those who intend to use it for text
based businessware on a green screen
VDU, This is rather like running the
aforementioned Rolls Royce o n
parafﬁn but a useful stopgap if funds
don't immediately stretch to  a new
monitor. There is a RF unit available
to allow the use of the machine with a
domestic TV set but, as with all 80

column systems, t h is  i s  n o t  t h e
recommended method of viewing the
Amiga and is only provided because of
public demand for such reﬁnements.
Up to four external disk drives can
be controlled via the single disk output
port. As with all Commodore drives,
they are not the fastest of units and do
tend to emit worrying grinding noises.
One advantage o f  external drives is
that y o u  c an tak e advantage o f
emulators (CP/M, PC-DOS etc). You
are then free to use drives other than
the usual 3.5 inch drives but I could
ﬁnd no simple way to select an external
drive as the main drive which could
give problems with some commercial
software,
Printers, modems and all o f  the
other paraphernalia of hi-tech living
can be connected to either the parallel
or serial connectors. As the range of
add-ons increases I  h o p e  s ome
enterprising o u t ﬁt  p r o d u c e  a
motherboard t o  prevent a ll o f  the
plugging a n d  unplugging whic h I
forsee in future years.
Sound Capahilities
The Amiga's sound capabilities are
ﬁrst class and a MI D I  interface will
mean that the portable A500 may well
be appearing o n  T op o f  the Pops
before too long. T o ensure the best
ﬁdelity there is a pair of stereo output
sockets which can either connect to a
stereo monitor or  plug directly into
your music system for  even higher
ﬁdelity.
The ﬁnal ports are possibly the
ones which will take the heaviest wear
and tear: the control ports. This is
where trackerballs, mous es  a n d
joysticks can be connected. There are
two ports available which resemble the
ports on the humble CM so there will
be n o  shortage o f  choice when
selecting y our  control devices. The
A500 package includes a mouse which
is essential for  interacting with the
Intuition operating system.
We have been praising the abilities
of the Amiga in  Your  Amiga, our
hi-monthly magaz ine w i t h i n  a
magazine, so I recommend that you
brush u p  o n  y our  back issues for
greater detail. T he ﬁrst package

Prices
The subject of software prices is also
one to be considered. Most packages
cost in excess of €20 which is not cheap
though you do get your money's worth
in terms of software development time.
The big problem is that the software
should not be bought 'blind'. At the
moment most retailers are more than
happy to give demonstrations but will
this be the case as the Amiga becomes
part of the furniture in more and more
homes? Your Amiga will point VOU in
the r ight direction b u t  hands o n

recommendation that a package can
get so now is the time to befriend a
local retailer.
Budget companies lik e Master-
twilit:, Code Masters and Firebird are
waiting in  the wings and there are
strong rumours of games at €9. This
would provide a fantastic boost to the
hardware sales for home use. After all.

at a popular price if the software is
prohibitively expensive?
Big Ques tion
The big question which everyone is
asking is. Will the Amiga become the
Spectrum of the 16 bit era or will the
ST take the laurels.'
Certainly. the Atari ST has a slight
advantage of price but what it lacks is
the blitter chip. Well, there are the
compromise blitter based Mega ST's
appearing but the price will certainly
equal. and probably' exceed that of the
A500. This is the crux of the matter on
the technical side. Ask any of the big
names in programming and they will
say t h a t  t h e  A m i g a  opens  u p
opportunities which the ST can only
dream of. Atar i seem to have more
than their fair share o f  the popular
press at the moment but I predict that
Iny Christmas Amiga will be the word
on everyone's lips.

A l o t  depends on pricing. The
standard S T  has  the edge a t  the
moment b u t  t h e  n e w  h e a d  o f
Commodore I J K  h a s  a  pos itiv e
attitude towards machine costing.
Already there is talk of reducing the
price of the C64 and 1 would not be
surprised i f  a  68000 price w ar  is
declared b e t w e e n  A t a r i  a n d
Commodore in  the r un u p  t o  the
Christmas buying bonanza. A  price
tag of a meagre t 500 could fall a little
further b u t  w i l l  Commodore risk
upsetting retailers by  reducing their
proﬁts?
The battle is for the 16 bit market
and whoever gets their foot ﬁrmly in
the door  w ill beneﬁt greatly from
future beneﬁts.
Even Acorn realise this with their

Commodore, it might he a good idea
to start off by introducing ourselves.
ICPUG (pronounced ickpug') is an
acronym f o r  t h e  Independent
Commodore Products Users Group.
With me so far? Good. Hands up those
of you who have seen our adverts in
this and previous isues. Even better!
Splendid! I am almost tempted not to
say any more about ourselves. but as
one Mr Spock so nearly once said 'The
ignorance o f  the few outweighs the
needs of the many.' So put your hands
down, get comfortable, and b e g i n .
How It all Began
ICPUG started out back in the dim
mists of time when computers were
big, drives were rare and IK was a lot of
memory! In those days (1979 actually)
£800 would just about buy an SK PET
with built-in cassette (see, Amstrad
had nothing new there) and 9" integral
monitor. Some people in the south
east corner of England got together

group.

and formed the Independent PET User
Group (  IPUG), life was  rosy, the
group ﬂourished and it had about 400
members.
Gradually!, PETs got bigger. 8K
gave way to I6K, which gave way in
turn to 32.K. Basic 2.0 was replaced by
Basic 4.0, T hen PET s  g o t  fatter,
developed a business keyboard and 80
column screen, g o t  bigger again,
memory soared t o  a  massive 96K
through the innovative technique of
bank switching.
In 1982a new computer arrived on
the scene. It had a massive 3.5K of
memory, t h e  phenomenal a n d
unsurpassed Basic 2.0 and a huge 22
column screen. But it was in colour.
and for a mere 1:200 it was a bargain.
Yes, the VIC-20 was born. A year later
and C o m m o d o r e  t r i e d  a g a i n ,
producing the best-selling 64. It had a

Basic 2.0, high resolution graphicsand
sound that nobody could get at, but
nearly 5 years later, and after one face
lift, i t  is still one o f  the best 8-bit
computers around.

N''here We Came in
! C M G  had a problem. Membership
was now in the thousands, hut the vast
majority had VI Cs and 64s - not PETs.
So a change of name was in order, and
'PET' was  dropped i n  fav our  o f
'Commodore Products', (Incidentally,

stuck with the PET label throughout

During the bad times o f  1985,

usually leave voluntarily), and more

the Amiga had ﬁerce competition in

thanks to some obscure law that says a

However we still trade under the name

said that ICPUG reacts to technical
information lik e a hoover reacts to

•Ihis is undoubtedly true, and is a
major reason for  our success. Why?
Because Commodore in their inﬁnite
wisdom have chosen to shed 99ci', of
their technical staff, and now we are
the only people who know anything
about what they sell. So when Joe

look out for new programs, hints and
lips, articles and even regular series. In
fact i f  you have something that you
think could be of use to other Commo-
dore owners we want to hear about it.
So if you have got something which
you think  we may be interested in.
How do you go about submitting it to

us;
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us_ We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  t h e  nex t
William Shakespeare but i f  you do
follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
1) I f  possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a mar gin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required — disk, printer
etc.
Your name
Your address
Your telephone number
4) The top of every page should have
the following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
READERS SUBMISSIO NS
Contributions
So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For ex ample, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something like the
following at the head of the page:
I nterrupts/J .Sm it hi I
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and wr ite i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom o f  each page you
should put the word MORE if there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page;
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances use a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
II) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.

13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides. We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it  just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors.
such a s  complexity o f  program.
presentation o f  program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between £10.00 and
£800.00.
16) A l l  payments are made in  the
month that the magazine containing
your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your
program as soon as possible.
18) I f  you want the program return-
ing to you, should we lind it unsuitable
for public ation, then y o u  should
enclose a  stamped s elf addressed
envelope.
19) The last and most important point
to make is 'get writing', we are waiting
for your articles.

Knowledge
Made Simple?
X
'Knowledge-Based System', aka a 'Michie' - named after the
developer and guru o f Knowledge Engineering, Donald
Michie. It claims to be the ﬁrst of its kind available for the
humble Commodore, but how useful will it be?
It is at least pleasant for C64/128 owners to be let in on
such a  widely mystiﬁed form o f  software. Knowledge
Engineering swings in and out o f fashion and seems to
engender passionately partisan reactions.
Readers o f the New Scientist may have noticed that
worthy journal is in the throes of backlash against the whole
idea. Considering the extravagant claims made by some of
the most wild-eyed advocates o f KBSs, this is at least
understandable.
What Is It?
C 64/128 S O F T W A R E
So what is an Expert System and why the fuss? Well, in a
sense it's a response to the usual world shortage of experts
(Educate more? Too simple...) Just as an industrial robot is a
device to capture, replicate, and reuse the manual skills of
the assembly line or craft worker, so the Expert System seeks
to do the same for some intellectual skills — those we
generally think of as knowledge.
Any such system, such as X PER, holds knowledge in the
tOrm of a set of 'learned' rules - the knowledge base creator
abstracts these out from their own ﬁelds o f study or
experience. The simplest example, which Abacus use in their
sample XPER knowledge base. may be that of zoology.
XPER is a new package that ﬁnally brings
the Expert System to the C64. Can it do
anything for you?
By Fin Fahey
Playing by the Rules
A trained zoologist will immediately be able to identify an
unknown animal by applying a series of classiﬁcatory rules
based on its appearance, behaviour or whatever. As these
rules are applied one by one, the number of alternatives is
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987

narrowed, eventually, with luck, to just one.
Which may seem obvious - after all, it's what many of us
do all the time, for example while diagnosing a car fault, or
debugging a program —  "It's not this — so it must be
that...".
The point, though, of the Expert System is that it may
contain se,ts of rules we don't carry ourselves, so it's just like
having an unpaid expert on tap all the time. Which is a
prospect that makes some experts, understandably, nervous.
Great XPEctations
So to XPER, X PER is deﬁnitely not expert itself. In fact, it's
a device for setting up expert systems, which of course, will
only be as good as the knowledge you've ﬁlled them with_
You can think of it as a sort of structured database system.
The designers haven't stinted on features, having included
all sorts of ways for you to get at your knowledge.
They've also made the program about as user-friendly as
a kill-crazed dingo with halitosis. There is some excuse for
this, since this sort o f  system i s  usually seen on
minicomputers upwards. In a big machine environment.
ease of use is positively frowned on.
XPER does have Help menus. The ﬁrst thing to do on
accessing one of these is to reach for the manual to get some
help interpreting the help. On doing this, you are faced with
gems of English prose such as: 'One or more attributes may
deﬁne the relation between the feature and the object, which
is the intersection of a feature and an object'. Abacus have
also invented the novel new verb 'inquirying'.
But...
But, just to be equivocal, in the end I found this to be a gooci
solid piece of software underneath. In some ways it makes a

C 64/128 S O F T W A R E
ange from systems that are all friendliness and no
stance_
The user should be warned however that there's a lot of
, undergrowth to hack through ﬁrst before getting any results,
Which brings us to: what do you use XPER generated
systems for ? Apparently the package has already been used
up knowledge bases in ﬁelds as various as tree
lion, animal classiﬁcation and car fault diagnosis,
ave a special need there may be a system out there
. iternatively, i f you possess a priceless fund of hard-

The software houses have been remarkably slow to get on
the trail and fo r years there were only a handful o f
adventure-style detective mysteries t o  solve, such as
Sherlock (Melbourne House) which was a spin-off from The

sleuthing software that's as varied as the victims.
Killed Until Dead
Supplier: Accolade (US Gold)
Price: E9.99 (Cassette)
Last month's game of the month poses one of the toughest
challenges to would-be hotel detectives - it begins as the
Midnight Murder Club book-in, ﬁve fanatical crime writers
aim to turn their ﬁctitious plots into real murder as they each
stake their claim to be the world's greatest murderer!
By using your joystick-controlled ﬁles, surveillance
cameras, notes and less subtle break-ins you aim to track
down the killer before he or she strikes at midnight. Despite
the simplicity of the game system each of the twenty one
cases is packed with myster)r, intrigue, red herrings, twists
and surprises that ensure you'll try and complete them all.

Marshall Robner is found dead inside a locked library.
Beside him are his tablets -  he was taking them for
depression. The autopsy shows he died from an overdose
The police think it's an open-and-shut case of suicide but
Robner's lawyer isn't convinced and has called you in to
investigate.
When you open up the case ﬁle (game box) you ﬁnd
transcripts of the police interviews with the main suspects, a
copy of the post mortem, a photograph of the scene of the
crime and even a sample of tablets. This is typical of the
quality of Infocom adventures in which you get absorbed in
the atmosphere of the game even before you load it in.
Once the disk is loaded you have just twelve hours to
solve the crime (if there was one) by sifting through the
evidence, searching the massive house, questioning the
suspects, deciding the importance of mysterious phone calls
to the widow and gambling debts owed by the son and, of
course,there's the will that was to be changed the very next
day....

The Vera Cruz affair gives you the chance to sign up for the
French police force and investigate the shooting of known
prostitute Vera Cruz. She was found in a pool of blood next
to a suicide note but you're once again convinced that it's a
murder.
The game aims to be an accurate representation of a
murder investigation and is played in two parts. In part one
you must search the scene of the crime for minute clues by
moving a cursor across the scene. I f  you ﬁnd anything
interesting then you'll get a close-up view and should make a
note in your notebook. Armed with these invaluable clues
you return to your ofﬁce to continue your investigation
using the S'ilrete's crime ﬁghting computers.
In part two you use computers to send messages to other
police forces to check the records for suspects, track down
car owners and to ﬁnd out about past or present prison
detainees. You can also order an autopsy and get a statement
from anyone as long as you have their name and address.
Statements can then be compared with evidence.
Gradually you will begin to widen your knowledge about
the life of poor Vera Cruz and her friends and pimps. Next,
you'll have to sort out facts from lies and inevitable red
herrings until ﬁnally, in your best French accent, you can
solve the murdeur.
The same game system is used in the sequel The Sydney
Affair. In this, you must discover why an innocent married
man with two children was gunned down with a high-
powered riﬂe and, of course, whodunnit?

Infogrames' third murdel nister shows a complete change
in style and gameplay and features a murder on the liner Le
Bourgogne during a voyage in the tension-ﬁlled pre-war
years of the 1930s.
Inside an Infocom-style packed box you'll ﬁnd the game
tape or disk nestled among telegrams, letters in French.
German. English and Braille, as well as photographs, secret
plans, negatives, passenger lists, a newspaper, a report from
the security ofﬁcer, secret notes. a capsule of ink, business
cards, a piece of string and a spent gun cartridge.
Unfortunately, having all this evidence at your ﬁngertips
doesn't make the game any easier and will only confuse you
if you try and look at it before you begin the game. Instead
you should start with a room by room search of the ship,
examine everything, question everybody and collect all the
evidence. Then save the game before sifting through what
you've got and the copious notes you've undoubtedly made
about the forty main suspects. Only then will you
understand the next stage and be close to deciphering the
web of intrigue on a ship fall aspics. secret assignations and
masked balls.
Once you think you've solved the crime you can load in a
separate test program that will help you check your facts but
will probably leave you with more questions than answers.

The Detective is a joystick-controlled, icon-driven murder
inquiry in which you play Inspector Snide (of The Yard) in

and an arrogant daughter.
Simple joystick controls move you around the mansion
and its many rooms. These are packed with objects to

and suspects to question. It's all done by pointing to the
icons that appear at the bottom of the screen. By cornering
the games characters you can question them about the
deceased Angus MacFungus, other characters and any
objects you've found. Unlike the other games it's as
important to  explore the mansion, and ﬁnd the secret
passageways, as it is to question the suspects. The result is a
playable mixture of murder. sleuthing exploration and more
sleuthing when the killer strikes again.

Murder Off Miami is a th re e
based on a Dennis Wheatley murder mystery. In this digital
version you play Inspector Kettering who's been brought in
to investigate yet another suspicious suicide. This time the
victim is Bolitho Blanc who, when alive owned a company
that controls half the soap market, Carlton Rocksavage
owns the company that controls the other half of the market
and it was his boat that Blanc was on when he committed
'suicide'.
The game was written using an enhanced version of The
Quill and I found it to be rather fussy about the order in
which you perform certain tasks. For example, Kettering
can't pick up his magnifving glass before he receives the
memo about Blane.
The game consists of three parts that represent the
three days of the investigation. They must be completed
in order - you save the game position after each part so
that you can load in the next.

Sir Charles Foxv,'orth and his trusty manservant Regis are
enjoying a trip down the Mississippi when they stumble
across a body and a murder to solve. With the blood still
warm, our aristocratic sleuth sets out to search the cabins for
clues and question the passengers about objects he has
found, the victim, other characters, and themselves.
Through joystick control o u r  heroes explore the
riverboat and its cabins and question anybody they meet
through joystick menus. From their testimony you can pick
out crucial points for your notes. These notes form the
foundation of your investigation and can be shown to other
characters, such as the judge, to get their reactions and
perhaps more clues.
Unfortunately, Sir Charles and his sidekick represent a
stereotyped American view of the British and so the game is
littered with 'I say, M'Lord's' which can be irritating but if
you manage to ignore them you'll enjoy the game.

phrases lik e 'Your  Commodore 64
computer is equipped with one of the
most sophisticated electronic music
synthesisers a v a ila b le  o n  a n y
computer'. You then look at a simple
listing to produce just one note, and
soon realise that sophistication is not
equivalent to ease of use. A myriad of
POKE instructions, no special BASIC
keywords to make the task easier, and
an awful lot of work required to make
even the simplest of noises.
Those are its bad points. But what
of its good ones? What. probably, does
the Commodore 64 give us for our
money?
The SID Chip
The quaintly named SI D  (boringly
standing for Sound Interface Device)
is indeed a very powerful custom-built
chip. Mos t other  computers w it h
sound capabilities have something like
an AY Sound Generator built into
them and this, although in itself useful,
cannot hope t o  compete with the
excellence o f  something that was
designed for a speciﬁc computer. AY
chips are mass produced. and can be
used by many different machines, but
SID is a one-oil and was built just for
the Commodore 64. Ifyou see SID, tell
him!
Voices
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
Making Music
SID has the capability to control three
separate musical 'voices'. That is, three
distinct effects can be created and used
to produce anything from a musical
The Commodore 64's sound chip. SID, is among the best
of its kind. Yet it's proverbially' hard for the beginner to
get to grips with. In the ﬁrst installment of a nett' series
Peter Gerrard shows you how.
By Peter Gerrard
concerto t o  discordant noise. O ne
voice could he producing a sound
rather lik e  a n  accordion, another
could be imitating a banjo, while the
third could be producing some kind of
percussive effect. However. SID is not
without its faults in this respect. since
we have to play all three of these voices
at precisely the same volume. We can
control that volume without reaching
for the volume control of the television
or monitor (since the Commodore 64
is one of those rare home computers
that produces its  noise through an
external r ather  t h a n  a n  inter nal
device), but that volume must be the
same for all three voices. Other factors,
as we shall be seeing, must also remain
constant across the three voices.
Envelopes
Envelopes, as well as being something
that you can post a letter in, also ﬁnd a
very useful home in the world of music,
and the world of computer music in
particular. T h e  t y p e  o f  s ound
produced by  any of the Commodore
64's voices is determined to a large
extent by the musical envelope being
used to create that sound. It affects the
voice q u a l i t y ,  a n d  c a n  b e
independently altered for any of  the
t
The f o u r  factors controlling a
musical envelope are referred to as
Attack, Decay. Sustain and Release, or
ADSR from now on. Attack tells us
how long it takes a note to rise from
zero volume t o  maximum volume.
Dccay refers t o  the length o f  time
taken to fall from that peak volume to
merely a half of that volume. Sustain
then determines the length of time that
the note is then played at half volume,
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987
57
before Release tells us how long it
takes the note to fall back into silence
once more. ADSR collectively make
up the envelope of a note, and as we've
seen can he independently altered for
any of the three voices.
Waveforms
The waveform o f  a note is another
factor in determining precisely what
type of note is going to be played. On
the Commodore 64 we have control
over four  distinct waveforms, and
these a r e  k n o w n  a s  T r ia n g le .
Sawtooth, Pulse and White Noise.
Typically, a triangular waveform can
be used to produce a mellow sound,
rather like a ﬂute, while a sawtooth
waveform, rich in harmonics, has a
more strident tone, lik e a  trumpet
perhaps. Pulse waveforms are possibly
the most interesting, since they can be
used to produce anything from a dull,
hollow tone to an almost nasal whine.
Finally, white noise waveforms are
precisely what they say they are, and
are usually used t o  produce sound
effects ranging fr om something as
straightforward as a wave lapping on a
shore, or a snake hissing at its prey, to
something more complicated, like the
percussion section o f  a rock group.
The group Velvet Underground were
once described as playing music that
sounded just like 'white noise'. How
they would have liked the Commodore
64!
Filters
Each o f  our three voices can have a

be play ing any  one o f  the f o u r

waveforms independently of the other
voices. Similarly, each voice can either
be tittered or  not, but the effects of
ﬁltering are then the same for  any
voice that is being treated in this way.
Filtering refers t o  the reduction o f
Frequencies a r o u n d  a  par tic ular
frequency. perhaps losing those above
a certain level, or below a certain level,
or perhaps passing those frequencies
either within or outside of a band of
frequencies. Four different types are
available to us on the Commodore 64,
Advanced Features
Two very advanced features are also
available to us on the Commodore M.
and ar e not often encountered o n
r elativ ely  i n e x p e n s i v e  h o m e
computers. The ﬁrst of these is known
as Ring Modulation, and despite its
rather unusual title refers to nothing
more complicated than modulating
one voice with respect to another. In
other wor ds . i f  v oic e o n e  wer e
modulated w i t h  v oic e t w o ,  t h e n
anything that one voice would d o
would also be echoed, in some way, in
the other voice. This is one of those
things that is  easier to demonstrate
than it is to explain!
Synchronisation is another step in
the direction o f  a  true synthesiser
rather than an ordinary noise-making
machine. As with ring modulation it is
probably easier to grasp the concept by
listening t o  something rather than
reading about i t ,  b u t  basically i t
involves lin k in g  o n e  v oic e w i t h
another s o  t h a t .  r a t h e r  t h a n
modulating. or varying the frequency
and volume of one voice with respect
to another. we try and produce the
same sound with Iwo (or even three)
voices. Thus  one c ould produce a
simple twelve bar riff with one voice
and synchronise it with another voice,
so that by merely altering one note in
the second voice the twelve bar riff is
instantly playing in a different key.
We'll be taking a close look at this sort
of technique later.
Conclusion
Weil, the Commodore 64 is equipped
with one o f  the most sophisticated
electronic music sy nthesisers available
on any computer. It's just one of the
most complicated to use, that's all.
Throughout t h e  r es t o f  t h is

stl
Everyone is familiar with statement .  coil
like PO KE 832,32 or PRINT PEEK,. elec
(832). That is. put the value 32 into e i t h
memory location 832, or print out the t h e
content o f  memory  loc ation 832. f o r
respectively. However, as far as the 25 B i n
control registers of SID are concerned, O n e
PRINT P E E K  (register) produces t h a
nothing sensible. Try PRINT PEEK c i r c
(54296), which is one of the registers in e i g t
question, and see what happens. You r e a
will be told that register 54296 contains i c a n
a zero. So, alter it with POKE 54296.25 t h i s
and then try PEEKing it again. To all
intents and purposes it still contains a
zero, o r  a  least that is  what the
Commodore 64 wants you to think. It
does, in reality, contain the value 0125.
but we cannot ﬁnd that out directk.
Other methods have to be used, and t)
far the simplest of these is to keep track
of a variable, El say, so that we could
POKE 54296X1 and PRINT El to ﬁnd
out what is going on.
Unfortunately
25 control registers perform more than
one task. Six of them do, in fact, and
they are all of vital importance to us in
our quest to produce something that
would make Jean Michael Jaffe sit up
and take notice, or Ron Hubbard 1
that matter. As far as those six registers
are concerned then, a simple POKE
command will not normally sufﬁce.
We must selectively alter the content o
a register, not just alter it willy-n illy.
Consider the following example.
POKE 54296,15
POKE 54296,16
Although the value put into register
54296 is different by iust one in the
two POKE statements. the effects that
would b e  pr oduc ed a r e  v a s t l

computer is nothing but a collection of
electronic circuits, and a circuit can be
either on Or off, nothing else, and so
the binary system of counting is ideal
for representing these t w o  states,
Binary uses only the numbers zero and
one, so a zero would represent a circuit
that was switched off, and a one, a
circuit switched on. Since there are
eight bits to the byte (and yes, four bits
really are referred to as a nybble), we
can think o f  a byte as looking like
this:
So.we have eight bits (numbered from
Zero to seven) and each of those eight
bits can be either o n o r  off. The
numbers above those bits refer to the
value that each represents. Thus, if bit 7
were turned on and all the rest were
turned off, then the byte would contain
the value of 128. If bit 6 were turned on
and the rest turned off, i t  would
contain the value of  64, and so on.
Now then, if bits 3, 2, I and 0 were
turned on, and the rest turned off,
what value would be in there?
Add up the numbers 008. 004, 002
and 001 and we arrive at 15, as in
POKE 54296,15 given earlier. I f  bit
4 were turned on, and the rest turned
off. the byte would contain the value of
16. Again, as in POKE 54296,16. Do
YOU see what has  happened? B y
POKEing with 16 instead of 15 we have
turned on a bit that was previously
aimed off, and turned offfour bits that
were previously turned On. If this were
a register with just one purpose it
wouldn't make any  difference, but
54296 happens to be one of those with
a dual purpose in life, as we shall be
seeing shortly.
'Fuming On
Consequently it  is  important, when
altering this and other dual-purpose
registers, to make sure that what was
turned o n  remains turned o n  ( i f
necessary). and what gets turned off is
indeed what we want to turn off. This
is achieved using the commands AND
and OR. which, as you may know,
work like this:
1010101 0
11001100
ANDing those two numbers together
produces the result 10001000. In other
words, wherever there is a I in the top
row that corresponds with a I in the
bottom row, we put down another 1.
C64 P R O G R A MMI N G
Anything else results in a zero. Thus
bits 7  and 3 remain turned on, the
others are turned oft
On the other hand, °R ing those
two numbers together produces an
entirely differ ent r es ult, namely
11101110. In this case, wherever there
is a 1 in the top row OR a I in the
bottom row we put down a one. So, in
this instance. bits 7, 5, 3 and I remain
turned on. and we also turn on bits 6
and 2 (this is beginning to sound a bit
psychedelic!). The rest remain off,
By selectively altering various bits
of a byte. then, we can happily work
with dual-purpose registers and alter
only that which we want to alter. A
lengthy, but necessary, diversion, if we
are t o  get the best out o f  the 25
available-to-alter control registers of
the SID chip. And now. before we go
any further, what do those registers
do? The following diagram shows us
that, and this is to be our Bible from
now on. We can do nothing but alter
the contents of these 25 registers, and
without knowing where they are in
memory we're not going to get very
Far. Don't worry yet i f  some o f  the
terms used don't make a lot of' sense,
all will be revealed in the long run,
First Steps
As can be seen from the diagram of the
SID Control Registers, there are an
awful lo t  o f  memory locations t o
worry about in the world of sound.
However, to make life easier for us in
these early stages we are only going to
bother with eight of those 25 registers,
and these eight are made up of seven
for voice one, and the overall volume
control for all three voices.
In order to produce a single note,
which is  all we'll be bothering with
here, there are a number of steps to
take. First o f  all, it's always best to
clear out any extraneous values that
may be stored in any of the 25 registers,
and this can be achieved by using a
simple FOR N E X T  loop, like this
perhaps:
5 FOR 1=0 TO 24:POKE 54272+1,0:
NEXT!
Then, it  is always wise to declare a
variable equal to our base location,
since r emember ing t h in g s  l i k e
'variable plus 7' is a lot easier than
trying t o  recall a l l  t h e  different
numbers like (54279). Usually I use the
variable V. and so the second line of
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987
59
our program would be something like:
10 V=54272
Having done that, four simple steps
are necessary in order to be able to
produce a note. We'll now consider
each o f
Volume
If you look at the table of SID control
registers, you'll see that the volume is
governed by location (V+24). It is also
one of those registers that is allotted
more than one function in life, but for
now w e  ar e concerned only  w it h
turning the volume on. From the table,
and o u r  earlier discussion o f  bits
within bytes, you will probably realise
that the volume can range from zero
through to 15, since the ﬁrst four bits
of the register are used to control the
volume, and turning all four t h o s e
on gives us a value 4(8+4+2+1), or
15,
A little bit of common sense serves
to tell us that the maximum volume
would relate to the maximum value,
and so if we alter location (V+24) by
POKEing it with a 15. we will achieve
that max imum volume. I t  helps if'
you've got the television set tuned
properly and the volume turned on as
well.
Consequently, the next line in our
program would be something along
the lines of:
15 POKE V+24,15
We must now turn our attention to
the envelope, or ADSR shape, of the
note that we're going to play.
ADSR
Later on we'll be looking at this in
much more detail, and with the aid of a
program. showing precisely how the
different ,ADSR settings, or Envelope
shapes, determine to a large extent the
quality of the note being played,
For now, we will concern ourselves
with two facts. The locations affecting
ADSR for  voice one are (V+5) and
(V+6), and each of those locations is
split into two halves, or nvbbles. The
top h a lf  affects attack and sustain
respectively, while the bottom half
concerns itself with decay and release,
in the order, So, when we alter the
content o f  location ( V+5)  w e ar e
affecting both the attack and the decay
rate. Harking back to our discussion of

bits and bytes again, we will see that
four bits can give a value in the range 0
to 15, so it ma kes sense to think of both
attack and decay as varying within that
range.
However, how can we POKE two
numbers with values between 0 and 15
into the same register? Well, think
about it, and you'll see that the decay
rate is indeed a value from 0 to 15 (it
affects the lower four bits of the byte).
while the attack rate is determined by
the top four bits. Assuming then that
we have an attack rate of somewhere
between 0 and 15, then by multiplying
that value by 16 we can arrive at the
overall value to be stored in location
(V+5). So, for an attack rate of 2 and a
decay rate of 9, we would arrive at a
ﬁnal value of (2*I6 + 9), or 41.
C64 P R O G R A MMI N G
Since the same principle applies to
sustain and release as well, with sustain
being multiplied by 16 and release just
having a straightforward value, the
next line of our program (assuming a
sustain value of 1 and a release value of
5) would look like this:
20 POKE V-1-5,41:POKE V-I-6,21
The thir d step is  t o  consider the
wavelength o f  E he note that we're
going to play.
Wavelength
We have already seen that there are
four different types o f  wavelength

noise. F r o m  t he table o f  contra
registers you'll see that the wavelength
is governed by  location (V-1-4), an
that this is yet another of those multi
purpose registers. Ignore those bi

arrive at the following mini-table a
values:
Wavelength V a l u e
Triangle

129
That is, by putting a value of 17 into
location ( V+4)  w e  w ould s et the
wavelength of voice one to be that °fa
triangle. Putting a value o f  16 in it
would turn that voice off, although
zero works just as effectively. I n  a
similar way, we would put a 33 into
location (V+4) and get a  sawtooth
waveform, or put a 32 there and turn i
off again. Noise is just that, noisy, and
although y o u ' r e  w e l c o m e  t o
experiment we'll stick to something
little bit more musical for now.
The Pulse waveform is the most
interesting, and requires t w o more
locations t o  be brought int o play
namely ( V +2 )  a n d  ( V+3) . Thes
determine the width of the pulse, that
is, the length of time it takes between
two successive peaks of the waveform
itself. (V+2) is the low value of the
pulse width, and (V+3) is  the high
value, or to put it another way, if  we
had a value of' 4 in location (V+3) and
25 in location (V+2) then the overall
pulse width would be ( 4
1049. Multiply  the high value by 256
and then add the low values. See if you
can ﬁgure out why that should be so
remembering t h a t  o n l y  numbers
between 0 and 255 can be stored in a
single byte.
Experiment with pulse waveforms
by all means, altering the high and low
values after you've set the waveform
itself. For now we'll stick to a sawtooth
waveform, and bearing in mind an
important fact when producing music
on the Commodore 64 (it is ALWAYS
advisable to clear the waveform and
then re-set it before playing a note) we
arrive at the next line in our program:

ENDURO RACER
A
Commodore July 87) I  predicted that there were more
conversions on their way. As if to prove my point Activision
releases it's version of the Sega coin-op bike racing game.
The object of the game isn't to win a race but to complete
ﬁve stages within set time limits. If you don't beat the clock
your game will end.
The ﬁrst stage is a simple t
write off anyone trying t o  cut corners. Bike-mangling
barriers arc strewn across the whole track and can be only
jumped by a well-timed wheelie,
In the next state giant boulders block your path, both on
and off the track, and in stage three the track is surrounded
by water so any mistake will end in a costly loss of time.
There are other bikes in the race but these seem to take no
part in the game as you can happily ride through them
without crashing or even slowing down.
Sadly this is another case where the C64 game is a direct
copy of the original Spectrum game and wastes the C64's
superior sound and graphics capabilities. A waste of a game
that could have been a coin-op classic.

war is now fought by genetically-created beings like yourself.
Now you are once again ordered to scramble into the sky in
your Eagle aircraft to defend the planet against alien attack.
The screen is split into two Defender-style game screens
in which you and your partner must blast away at the
terminators, killer squads, nasty patrols, warriors, bouncers,
tracers and ﬁreballs that have invaded every zone. As your
skill improves you'll be able to collect the enemy message
droids that you must deliver to your underground base.
Collect ﬁve of these and your ship will be equipped with a
Devastator device which acts like a smart bomb destroying
all aliens on the screen.
The second ship can either be controlled by a human or
computer opponent, that you compete with to get the most
kills to win the honour to lead the squadron. If you're
playing against the computer or a head to head opponent
you must duel to death to prove your superiority. This seems
unlikely - it's a little pointless to have Eagles ﬁghting each
other when there are hordes of aliens to be destroyed.

When I loaded I almost fainted — the speech is fantastic.
A funny little voice says 'I Ball, 111  Ball'. This sounds
wonderful. When you are killed the voice says 'Oh no!' and
at the end of the game the voice says 'Game Over'. The music
is also brill and very well thought out, which gives the game a
very polished feel.
You control a renegade ball, on a mission to rescue his

Reaching them is no easy task there are solid obsticals
and electric barriers that will sizzle you on contact, together
with the millions of nasties that inhabit the defence zones. If
you shoot a lot of these a power disk will appear (hints of
Nemesis here) and when collected will give you extra
weapons such as a Single Laser, which lets you ﬁre sideways.
a Turbo, which gives you extra speed, and a Bullet spray,
which gives powerful ﬁre support above and below you.
Also available is the Molecule Bomb which nullifys all the
electrical barriers (very useful). Another wicked weapon is
the Rainbow Ripple Laser (sounds a bit like Salamander)
which will blow the most conﬁdent Pod Person from Mars
into a thousand blistering blisters.
Sound-wise this game is great, with good speech, good
music and good spot effects. It is also strong on graphics
with clear characters, no ﬂicker, smooth scrolling and smart

I could go on for ages about the great gameplay, fantastic

four divisions o f  opponents, and play-offs fo r  the
championship pennant.
Your ﬁrst task as coach is to select your batting line-up to
face the ﬁrst match. Make sure you've got some utility
players sitting on the bench in case your star batsman holes
out or your pitcher starts giving away home runs.
As the game begins the screen shows a sideways-on yiess
of the ball park with ﬁelders spread around the bases and the
outﬁeld. When a ball is about to be pitched half the ﬁeld is
covered by a 3D batsman's view of the pitcher as he winds up
to deliver change-ups and fast balls. Once the ball is hit the
screen reverts back to the whole ﬁelding screen.
The result looks and plays like a patch stuck on to the

GERRY THE GERM
i
play the part of a germ who has failed his stinkploma exam
and, ﬁlled with indignation, he sets out to claim the title of
'Virulent Virus Of The Year', so off he goes to infect a body
with his disease. To start off with he has to deprive the lungs
of air thus starving the brain, but while doing this he comes
under attack from the red blood cells and white cells. So he
then moves on to the kidneys. Here he must again dodge the
white and red blook cells, and while he is doing all this he
must collect four wacky kidney beans (wait for it) so he can
go to the loo.
Next it's onto the stomach where he must grab a bottle of
acid and dissolve the aspirin which blocks the exit to the next
screen. Junk food is another problem, you must stop this
entering the stomach just by touching it, and when all that's

been done (phew!) it's on to the pancreas. This is a tricky
little screen and a bit stupid too. You must infect the medica‘
supplies by nutting (i.e. headbutting) them - daft isn't it?
Again there are blood cells to be avoided, plus a ticket
inspector complete with steam engine. If you go to the engine
you can cause a ﬁght between the engineer and the driver by
throwing coal at the latter...excuse me ...just what planet
does this so-called human come from?
And now the one you've all been waiting for The Heart.
The idea here is to cause a heart attack by deﬂecting an
arrow into this poor organ. To deﬂect the arrow just use the
television (sic) but the arrow will kill you if you do not have
the TV. With all this done you are now eligible for a
•stinkploma degree'.
Well, I must admit this game is different but that doesn't
always make for brilliance does it? 1 feel the plot is in bad
taste and some of you may well agree. Gameplay is rather
dull and slow and it can often get quite tedious. The music,
supplied by Rob Hubbard, is brilliant, really jolly and
bouncy. About seven tunes in one game can't be bad.
So should you go out and buy this game? On the grounds
of cool music maybe, but the game leaves a lot to be desired.
If you are bored and have two quid to spend it might prove
entertaining — for a while.

Mastertronics' Milk Race. Was it worth the wait?
Well I'm saying nothing yet. The idea is simple -just race
through all the major cities of England — sounds simple
doesn't it? As just one of the 84 Competitors in this year's
Milk Race you'll need to summon up all your energy and
stamina to maintain 1st position over all 13 stages of the race
which you must do in order to win.
The game starts up with the title screen of a man pedaling

his bike up a hill accompanied by a soundtrack which also
plays through the game. With a tap on the joystick button
you are then presented with a map of England showing the
route marked out and numbered. Tap the joystick again and
a menu is thrown up on the screen which will let you choose a
joystick in port two, redeﬁne the keyboard or choose preset
keys.
When this has ben selected, it's onto the game, you start
off in ﬁrst gear and can change, if you wish up to 13th gear,
depending on road conditions. The road is shown on a little
graphic icon in the corner of the screen which rises and falls —
when on level ground it falls straight. I thought this a good
touch.

The game, however, can be quite frustrating - you will
probably ﬁnd yourself screaming at your computer as you
are killed off without any warning by a hit-and-run car
driver. This causes a time penalty which could result in the
game ending. but practice makes perfect.
I quite enjoyed this game, the graphics are good, the
sound is good and there are some very nice touches. For
example when you ride past a spectator he will turn his head
as you pass him - this gives a good feel and adds to the
atmosphere.
For only E1.99 who can moan (Mary Whitehouse?) Go
and get it before the shops sell out, quick.

You are a little man competing in a futuristic race inside0
an extensive complex. There are also various traps includin
water holes which if fallen into, will loose you time as you
struggle to get out. Then there's the Electro Mats which send
you ﬂying as you receive an electric shock. Again these will.
stun you causing loss of time. Next come the Hurdles which
must be avoided or jumped, otherwise you'll end up on the
ﬂoor losing more time. Green Mats slow you down to
quarter of your normal speed, and other nasties include cok
cans (no doubt a sneaky bit of advertising) and rats which
cling onto you and must be shaken off or they will slow you
down.
On the helpful side there are quite a lot of things such
Springboards which will bounce you a short distance at
twice your normal speed. Green Cans speed you along n
matter where you are on the screen. but these only last for
short time. Blue Cans can also be found lying around - if y
jump on these the clock stops for two seconds (gasp!).
When you negotiate all the traps and make it to the ﬁnis
line you stop and take a rest. This is quite good as your ﬁgu
puts its hands on its knees and puffs and blows (just like th
arcade). Then it's on to the next round - there are 24 in all.

Baseworld, DUStWOrld, Iceworld a n d  Mallwodd. T h e
individual worlds ar e k nown t o  mos t people as  the
Firetracks and they're well known because oldie pirates that
inhabit them.
At ﬁrst you think it's another routine mission to wipe out
the pirates and their bases, then mission control informs you
that somewhere in the Firetracks is a powerful source of
energy known as the White Light. The light must be found
for if it falls into the hands of the pirates it could mean total
destruction of the surrounding planets! So you sup up your
last drop of Rosy Lee and jump into your Haehﬁghter which
speeds you off to Save The Universe.
OK, First let's get the moans out of the way. A really
annoying 'feature' in this game is the built-in auto-ﬁre. Yes it
ﬁres by itself. although it doesn't destroy the gameplay too
much. Right - that's my moans out of the way, onto the
graphics. They arc nice, colourful and detailed, and the
aliens are well animated.
The different worlds are nice and big with a fair bit of
variety thrown in for good measure. The end result is a
playable and interesting game that doesn't leave a sour taste
in the mouth. I think I might as well recommend this. OK?

Years and years ago, back in the 22nd century, there was
at famous conﬂict known to the people of Earth as the Droid
Wars. Hundreds of aliens attacked the Earth's powersupply
grids suspended in space, but they were no match for us and
promptly ﬂed. Then one day (about 100 years later), a great
telescope is  used t o  monitor the planet, and a  great
movement of droids is registered. The aliens are planning to
nuke Earth. O f course this can't be allowed, so You are

alien that lives. Some things are more easily said than done.
Your ship consists of one main ship with another three

so you can imagine how small they are. Nevertheless this
game has an addictive pull to it, though it does't last too
long. It's easy to play and you can select the level you wish to
start on. Another unusual feature is the way the ship changes
formation as you go through the levels and the screens swap
around (upside-down etc).
This isn't to my taste, but if  you are an out-and-out

WIZBALL
W
say this makes a change. Wizball is quite weird. Don't get me
wrong, 1 am not saying it's rubbish -  I'd be lying. You play
the part o f  the wizard who lives on a colourful planet
somewhere in space. So there he is minding his own business
and admiring the nice landscape. when someone steals his
colour!
Yes, the entire planet is now monochrome (yuk!) so
being a proud wizard he creates a novel form of transport
with powerful offensive weapons, but these need to be
bought with credits (I knew it, Nemesis again),
Your Wizball. as the vehicle is known, bounces like a

normal ball. This makes it quite hard to control. Get a credit
and you will be given thrust. Another credit gives you an it-
gravity -  this makes things much better as the ball will now
only respond to the joystick instead of bouncing all over the
place.
Weapons can now be activated and a Cat called up. The
Cat is a small ball which has nine lives, known as a Catellite
(moan!). You can also select weapons for your Cat such as
multiple ﬁring and a laser. If you want to be real greedy you
can hog them for the Wizhall. Other weapons include a
power beam which will ﬁre above and below your ball.
Next comes the Cat which is a bargain at three credits,
then there's the laser, a steal at only four, now the wicked
Multi-ﬁre. This awesome gadget will reduce any alien to a
smouldering ash pit, now the biggy. yes, The Smart Bomb.
This will wipe out any grotty alien with ease, just wiggle the
joystick (thats how you select all gadgets) and — POW! —
all the meanies are vapourised. A bit pricey at a modest 7
credits is the ultimate in Wizball technology, The Shield.
This little baby will keep you and your Cat safe and sound —
you can charge about without a worry as aliens burst on
impact with you. Sadly, it doesn't last long.
When your're happy with your weapons you can start
collecting the colours — to do this yOU will need a Cat. The
colours look like little balls but when shot they release a drop
of pigment which must be caught by the Cat before it hits the
ground.
At the bottom of the screen are cauldrons. These tell you
how much colour you have — each drop of colour is added
in. When these are full you are warped off to the bonus stage.
Here you can knock your score up vastly and if you manage
to last long enough you get the chance to get an extra

So our brave little hero sets off to rescue her and defeat
the evil King. This is not an easy task as you may guess.
Wonderboy consists of 7 lands, each land divided into 4
sections and each of these four sections consist of another 4
areas (think about it) so our hero has a long way to go before
he can ﬁnally confront King.
You start off in the jungle, with rocks, rolling boulders,
snakes, wasps and snails (pall!) all trying to kill you, then its
on to the desert, where killer frogs (ha!) and falling platforms
must be negotiated. Backgrounds come in abundance, and
very nice they are too.
Scattered around the playing area are various weapons
concealed in eggs (eggs?) which have to be broken to ﬁnd out
what is inside. The ﬁrst egg that you encounter contains a
hammer which will give the nasties a good thumping and
send them ﬂying. There are also skateboards to be had, but
these are sometimes a hinderance as vou can not stop dead
when riding them.

regularly and can be picked for bonus points, and if  you
happen to come across a mushroom this will change all the

take my advice and buy it. You won't regret it acquiring this

The only story line you are given to guide you is that you
must seek out and destroy the evil sorceror Ash too.
As you wander round the maze, you will ﬁnd certain
objects, Some of these will be found in empty rooms while
others will be guarded by one of an assortment of monsters
—goblins, witches, vampires and the like. Your only means
of defence against these mimics is to cast a spell. Initially, you
GAMES R E V IE WS
can only use a 'blast' spell. More potent magics have to be
found.
As well as monsters, there are locked and invisible doors,
tour different types of well — both harmful and beneﬁciaL
teleports and vortices. Controlling your character is a simple
turn left, turn right and straight on for movement with two
function keys being used t o  scroll through the lis t of'
available commands,
The ﬁrst problem with this game is one of working out
just where you are. This is because the game decides to draw
everything as your character sees it, rather than how you see
it sitting in front of the screen. The results of this are most
confusing and just about render the game unplayable —
unless you happen to be the sort o f  person who enjoys
mapping and can easily cope with mirror images of rooms.
Then there is the fact that nothing seems to happen. You can
wander round for long periods of time without meeting
anyone or anything. And when you do, the chances are that
they will not have anything that you need.
All in all, a very tedious game let down by some dreadful
gameplay. Give it a miss,

idea but is also so infuriatingly addictive that you curse
yourself for not having thought of it ﬁrst. Such a game is
Zolyx.
Derived from the 'Painter' type games popular a few
years ago, the object of Zolyx is to shade in three quarters of
the screen. No more, no less.
You control a cursor which starts off on the edge of the
screen. As you move it into the playing area, so it leaves a
trail behind it. It" you can connect your cursor to safe
territory —  either the edge of the screen or a previously

constructed block, then the area that you have just deﬁned is
tilled in.
Naturally, it isn't quite that easy. Small dots move round
the screen and background areas and if one of these touches
your trail, a life is lost. Likewise if you go back on your own
trail. I f  you trap one of the dots in an area, there is an
impasse. The dot remains trapped but you don't ﬁll in the
area either. As  you progress through the levels, so the
number of dots increases. To help you out of a potential
pickle, you can reverse the direction of the dots but only once
on the ﬁrst level, twice on the second level etc.
Graphically, the game is dreadful — the colour of the
shading doesn't even change when you progress onto the
next level. This just goes to show that great graphics aren't
the be all and end all of a good game.
For only t1.99, Zolyx will appeal to any strategy fans
who will, like me, spend hours working out whether it is
better to go for a few large areas or lots of little ones.G.R.

There's a lot of moves and blocks available to the player. A
few of the moves include The Web of Death, head butting,
kicks to the groin, (ohhhhhhh!), leg chops and the lethal
neck chop, which will slice off your opponent's head with a
sort-of-chopping-somebody's-head-off sound (really
gruesome). The blood spurts out as the body slumps to the
ground with a thud and is dragged off by a giggling goblin.

released Mag Max, but it looks like it was knocked up in a
week. This is not the ﬁrst time Imagine have cocked up an
arcade conversion, and taken a year to do it (remember
Mikie?),
Why, oh why. do they insist on doing arcade conversions
that they can't handle? This game is dreadful and insults the
lab arcade version.
You play the part of a robot, well a bit of one as you are
not fully built yet, so you have to ﬁnd parts of your body
which will give you extra ﬁrepower.
You tr undle across a  drab-looking planet surface
shooting at ground bases. This bit makes me laugh, as there
are bugs galore. For instance sometimes the bases can't be
shot — your bullets go straight through them but they still
ﬁre at you — and don't be surprised if you ﬁnd yourself
dying for no reason as this happens a lot.
The object of the game is to destroy a huge dragon that
waits at the end of each level, which I managed with ease
after a few attempts. Fite graphics are not so, bad, but the
glitches did annoy me a lot. I ngame there is no music but the
title scene sound is great.
This a bit of mixed bag. I'm afraid. It does have good
points but these have little addictive pull. Personally I wasn'
impressed, but my brother loved it.

Many people feel rather daunted when necessity forces
them to start thinking in a number base other than 10.
Help is at hand with our base tutor program.

humans is in base 10. purely because
we're gifted with 10 ﬁngers so our
rudimentary intelligence latched on to
this fact when we ﬁrst started to count.
Computers, however, hav e n o
ﬁngers a n d  c ommunic ate us ing
different number methods and this is
where many  people get confused,
because converting from one base to
another can seem rather complicated
at ﬁrst.
This i s  wher e o u r  Univ ers al
Number Base Tutor can come to your
aid. I t  is  a n  educational program
which will show you the best methods
of converting from one base to another
(up t o  hexadecimal) a s  w e ll a s
providing practice and a quiz for you
to test yourself.

Aims
This educ ational p r o g r a m  w a s
designed with the following objectives:
L Convert decimal (denary) to any
base.
2. Convert any base to denary.
3. Convert any base to any base (up to
6).
4. Demonstrate clearly how 1111111ber
base conversion is carried out.
5. Test undemanding.
All these objectives have been
achieved in the program.
With the increasing need to under-
stand number bases fully under the
modern maths approach, the program
may well ﬁnd application in schools as
well as the home.

W
Commodore 16, I was impressed by
the i m p r o v e m e n ts  m a d e  t o
Commodore basic. But it wasn't too
long before i t dawned on me that
Commodore had forgot one important
feature which 64 owner's had come to
take for granted. I t  didn't support
sprites!
For most serious applications and
general computer use, the computer
performed quite adequately. I t  was
only w h e n  I  ca me  t o  games
programing that this missing feature
became something of a problem. The
only way possible to  move object
blocks of any size around the screen
was t o  incorporate the necessary
characters into a string, along with
complicated control characters. These
strings were then guided around using
the handy CHAR command. This
worked reasonably well, but suffered
from screen scrolling problems and
wiped out any other characters that
got in the way!
These problems prompted me to
write a machine code routine which
would, to some extent, mini mick the
sprite facility on the 64. C16 SPRITE is
an interupt-driven routine with which
it is possible to display a six character
sprite anywhere on the screen. Certain
pokes will instantly move the sprite
around whilst others control which
sprite data block is displayed as well as
sprite to background priority. Other
features are collision detection and
selective priority (not found on the 64).
Alone with notes on how to use this
utility. I've included a  short basic
program which demonstrates how
easy the system is. Equally good results

can be obtained by using this routine
as part o f a basic or machine code
program. T o  effectively use C I 6
SPRITE, it will be necessary to know
brieﬂy how the routine works. A block
of six characters (3 wide by 2 deep) will
be displayed o n  the screen. Their
position will be determined by two
addresses which hold their X and Y Co-
ordinates. The actual characters (and
colours) displayed will be held in a
sprite block buffer, just above the

remembers w h a t characters and

replaces them when the sprite is moved
or turned off.

How To Use C16 Sprite
Let's test the system, First protect the
utility fro m being overwritten b y
Basic. To do this type:
POKE 52,47:POKE 56,47:CLR
Now load 'Cl6 SPRITE* by entering
monitor and typing:
L 'Cl6. SPRITE',08
Tape users will need to position the
tape at the beginning o f the utility
before this command.
Next, we need to  form a sprite.
Either the standard character set or
user deﬁned graphics may be used, but
for this exercise let's keep it simple!
Our test sprite will be a red reverse
block.
At this point. I will explain how the
sprite data is stored in the buffer. The
buffer is divided into 21 blocks, each
containing 12 bytes. The ﬁrst 6 bytes of
each block are fo r character data,
leaving the other 6  fo r  character
colour, So, to ﬁll the ﬁrst block with
reverse spaces, type:
FOR A=01'05 :POKE 16128-1-A,160:
C S
P
R
I
T E' O E
Typing in C16 Sprite
Type in listing 1 as it appears and save
to tape or disk after correcting any
errors. Now run the program, Next,
with the data i n  place, enter the
monitor and save a boot-load version
by typing,:
S 'Cl6. SPRITE',08,3C00,3EE9
Remember to use 01 instead of 08 if
using tape.
IL I
C16 U T I L I T Y
NEXTA
16128 is the ﬁrst address for the ﬁrst
block, whilst 160 is the screen code for
a reverse space. Now we need to add
the colour. To do this, type:
FOR A=0T05 :POKE 16134-EA,82:
NEXTA
This will colour all o f the reverse
spaces a medium red. Having placed
the sprite data into position, it will be
necessary to let the system know where
it is. So, to set the sprite pointer to
point to our sprite, type:
POKE 15986,0
Finally, before we turn on the
sprite, choose a position for it. For the
X position, choose any value between
0 and 37. The Y position can be any
value between 0 and 23. Addresses
1594(J and 15941 are for the X and Y
positions respectively., so choose values
for X and Y and type:
POKE 15940. X: POKE 15941. Y
Now fo r the moment o f truth!
Clear the screen and turn on the sprite.
Type:
SYS DECe3E95)
If the above procedure has been
followed correctly, then a red block
will be displayed on the screen at your
chosen position. If not, then turn off
the sprite (SYS DEC '3E75') and try
again. Please note that the system will
not respond to position values outside
maximum and minimum parameters.
Don't be afraid to experiment a
little more with our sprite. Try altering
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987
75
some o f the addresses in the above
chart to  alter sprite positions and
colours or characters. Remember that
C16 SPRITE is interupt driven. so that
it will not be necessary to keep turning
on the sprite, just alter the appropriate
address f o r  instant results. Al so
remember to turn off the system when
not required (SYS DEC('3E75')), or
strange things may start to happen!
If you wish to change sprite to
background priority, then a  0  i n
address 15981 will cause the sprite to
lie in front of any characters on the
screen, A  255 i n this address will
change it to lie behind, It is possible to
make the sprite lie in front of some
characters and behind others. This can
be very useful, and used to good effect.
Here is an example of how to use this
facility:
POKE 15982,26:POKE 15981,1
Now, any characters whose screen
code is within the range 1 to 26, (i.e.
alpha numerics), will n o w  always
appear in front o f the sprite. Any
others will be behind, Two rules apply
here: all characters with screen codes
within selected parameters will be
foreground; and 127 is the maximum
amount of foreground characters.
Another handy feature o f  this
utility is collision detection. As long as
our sprite rests in a clear part of the
screen, address 15983 will contain a
zero. If, when the sprite is moved. it
happens to be in front of, or behind a
character, then address 15983 will
contain a  1. This makes collision
detection a piece of cake!
Limitations
Using CI6 SPRITE will not cause the
screen to  scroll, but your program
may. I f  this happens then the sprite
characters will also scroll. This is,
unfortunately, a  limitation o f  the
system. Another is that the system
updates the sprite only if any changes
in the control addresses are detected;
this is to avoid ﬂickering. However,
ﬂickering m a y  occur i f ,  during
animation techniques, th e  sprite
pointer is changed rapidly when the
sprite is near the bottom of the screen.

Plus/4 is a lot faster at communicating
using RS232 than the 64. This is due to
the 64 using a software simulation to
copy the action of the 6551 AC IA IC
which would normally be used for
RS232. Indeed, the 64 is so slow that it
often misses characters even at the
leisurely 300 baud,
The Plus/4 on the other hand, has a
6551 whic h handled all the RS232
signals except CTS which is dealt with
by a 6529. Also, there is no need to
connect S-into pin B (as suggested in
•Interfaeing w ith the RS232', Your
Commodore, January 1987, p 82-90).
The Plus/4 software has the ability
to use XO N/XO FT ﬂow control with
the user's choice o f  XO N /XO F F
characters. These are normally CTL/S
for XOFT and CTL/Q for XON. This
facility is  used t o  stop the remote
device from transmitting more data
when the receiving device has no more
room in its input buffer, and to restart
the remote device when the receiving
device has removed enough characters
from its bulTer.
The Plus/4 has a dedicated 64-byte
RS232 user receive buffer located at
S03 F7, to $0436, and a one byte system
transmit buffer at SSO7CF which is
used to hold the current XON/OFT
character.

Checks for a remote device initiated
XON/XOFF sequence and handles it
appropriately:
Checks user receive buffer is full, and if
so then ignores this received character
and returns;
If there is room for eight characters,
then it  sets various ﬂags, and stores
XOFF character from SED into the
system transmit buffer and puts the
received character in the user input
buffer.

Listing 38: Machine code prugram to copy ROM to RAM and inhibit switching to ROM,
buffer-full and remote-paused ﬂags
and initiate sending o f  the X O N
character.
Note t h a t  t h e  X O N / X O F F
protocol is used only if  the user has
POKEd the XO N/XO F F  characters
into SEC and $1-
two locations are zero then characters
received when the buffer is full are
ignored.
And The Proof...
I have tested the Plus/4 connected to a
BBC Model B, running at 19,200 baud,
with the BBC sending the Plus/4at full
speed, and over a one hour period not
a single character was lost by  the
Plus/4. T he t w o programs for  the
Plus/4 and the BBC  are shown in
Listing I and 2.
Unfortunately, there is a bug in the
Plus/4 ROM RS232 routines, which
P L U S / 4  U T I L I T Y
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987

causes the Plus/4 to crash immediately
after it has transmitted the ﬁrst XON
resume character, and the rest of this
article describes how to ﬁx this bug.
First we need to make our own
copy of  the Kemal RO M, and then
patch the incorrect code. This is not so
easy... Listing 3 is a listing of a Basic
Program and a machine code program
which copy the ROM down into RAM,
cause the new version of the Kemal to
be executed, and inhibit switching
back t o  RO M. The top of memory
pointers are also reset to S7EFF, and
the bad code in the RAM copy is ﬁxed.
The Basic program must be typed in
Exactly as shown. with No additional
spaces, etc , a s  t he machine code
program is  immediately above it at
$4163.
A disassembly of the RS232 code in
the Kemal is included in ﬁgure 3.

windows w it h  y our  64, and then
writinu text to those windows in an
attempt to emulate the features of the
ubiquitous IBM PC? It is not a difﬁcult
task i n  Bas ic  us ing t h e  graphics
symbols available in the Commodore
character set. However, it is of limited
use in this simple form, and is very
cumbersome to manipulate.
The routines which are presented
in this article are all machine code
based. T h e y  e n a b l e  c o m p l e x
windowing tasks to be implemented
easily, a n d  pr ov ide many  us eful
features.
With these routines you can draw a
window of any size, anywhere on the
screen. On removing that window, the
text underneath is restored. Up to ﬁve
windows can be displayed at any one
time, a n d  i n  a l l  cases t h e  tex t
underneath is restored as each window
is removed. The windows can even
overlap o n e  another . T h e  o n l y
restriction impos ed w h e n  u s in g
multiple windows, is that they must be
removed i n  reverse order t o  their
application,
Finally. routines ar e presented
which a llo w  t h e  contents o f  the
windows to be scrolled in any one of
four directions: up. down, left and
right. Indeed, multiple scrolling o f
different w in d o w s  i n  d if f e r e n t
directions is  possible, although this
feature c a n n o t  b e  a p p lie d  t o
overlapping windows.
Now, down to the routines. All the
code has been written and assembled
using the Supersoft Micro Assembler.
but is pretty well universal. The code
has been assembled starting at $C110

Put text anywhere on the screen you want, and scroll it
too, with this set or  fast C64 routines.
By R.A. Henderson
SO that it does not interfere with your
Basic program. T h e  pr ogr am i s
constructed f r o m  a  number  o f
modules, a n d  t h e  l i n e  numbers
presented with each module, whilst
essentially arbitrary, do enable you to
slot the modules together easily.
Listing 1 - Variables
The ﬁr s t routine declares a ll t he
variables used by the program. It also
identiﬁes, in line 300, the start point
for the assembly process at SCI 10.
A word or two about the major
variables will ease understanding of
the program.
Each window is deﬁned by  four
parameters: the top left-hand corner of
the window frame; the number o f
columns and rows of text within the
window: and the colour of the window
frame.
The corner is  identiﬁed b y  its
memory loc ation. T h i s  c a n  b e
established by referring to the screen
memory map in Appendix G  of  the
User Manual. The top left-hand corner
of' the screen is 1024 ($0400), and the
bottom right 2023 ($07E7). The corner
must b e  identiﬁed as  t w o  bytes.
LOCORNER and HICO RNER. i n
normal low-high format.
The o t h e r  t h r e e parameters,
COLUMN, ROW and COLOUR, can
all be speciﬁed as single byte numbers,
and in the case of COLOUR, this is
deﬁned in  Appendix G  o f  the User
Manual.
FRAME represents the parameters
which make up the window frame. By
referring to Appendix E of  the User
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987
87
Manual, you will see that 73 is the top
right-hand corner of the frame. 66 is a
vertical line. 75 the bottom right-hand
corner, 67 a horizontal line, 32 a space.
85 the top-left corner and '14 the
bottom left- hand c or ner . T hes e
parameters can be changed. if desired,
to give alternative window outlines.
In order to restore the contents of
the screen once a window is removed,
it is  ﬁrst necessary t o  save those
contents. T o avoid wasting valuable
memory space. I have chosen to store
the contents of the screen under each
window in that area of RAM which
resides beneath t h e  Basic R O M .
MEMSTRT identities the start of each
stored window in memory, using two
bytes in low-high format, and starts at
$A000. PNTR points to the start of the
most recent window. MEMC O R N
stores the corner location in two bytes,
and MEMPARAM uses two bytes to
s tor e C O L U M N  a n d  R O W
respectively.
A word of warning! There are no
traps in the program to prevent you
from specifying unreliable windows.
Poor speciﬁcation c a n  r es ult i n
windows whic h w r ap around t h e
screen, or , worse, i f  you specify a
window whose size would cause it to
go beyond memory
then y ou ar e i n  grave danger o f
overwriting y o u r  Bas ic  program.
starting at $0800.
Listing 2 - Drawing a Window
Having declared o u r  variables i n
Listing 1, this is the ﬁrst routine which

actually does something.
To prove that this routine works.
assemble it, together with the variables
(Listing 1) and make the follow ing
POKES (in immediate mode):
l'OK E49427,166:P0K E49428.4:
P0KE49429,10:P0KE49430.15:
POK E49431,5.
Now c a ll SYS49473 a n d  y o u
should sec a  green window frame
appear instantly On your screen.
Listing 3  -  Save and Replace
Window
Before drawing a window, it is ﬁrst
necessary to save the screen contents
under that window. Then, when you
remove that window, the original
screen contents can be replaced.
Now assemble Listing 3 together
with Listings I and 2, and then repeat
the series of POKES. Call SYS 49582
followed by.• SYS 49473 and the green
window will appear. Now call SYS
49714, The window is removed, and
the original screen contents replaced.
Listings 4 and 5 - Scrolling
The routines i n  Listings 4  and 5
provide up, down, right, and left
scrolling of the windows. If you don't
want this  facility, then omit these
routines entirely.
We w on't bother testing these
routines until you've entered our ﬁnal
two listings, since this next listing
avoids the need for all those POKES.
Listing 6 - Data Entry
We can simplify the process of entering•
our window data by  making use of
functions already in your 64. The ones
we will use are
1. At $E206 in the kernal ROM. which
fetches the current character.
2. At SE20E also in the kernal, which
checks for, and skips the "," character.
3, At SA96B in the Basic ROM, which
places the entered data into locations
$14 and SI5 of Zero Page.
Listing 6 accomplishes this by loading
C64 U T I L I T Y  111
our window parameters. LOCORNER,
111CORNER, CO LUMN. ROW and
COLOUR, into the variables table of
Listing I.
Listing7 - Module Linker
I have presented you with a number of
routines which can be strung together
to p r o v i d e  a  c o mp r e h e n s iv e
windowing program. This last listing is
self-explanatory, and simpliﬁes the
task of accessing the various functions
from Basic. I f  you have decided to
Omit the scrolling routines, then delete
line 590 to 910 also.
If you have entered all the code and
assembled it, then you should get a
start address for assembly of SCI10,
and a ﬁnish address of SC4013.
Now down to using the program.
The machine code can be accessed

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-1-21 means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
ISPC41 o r, exceptionally, ISSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
{CTRL N .  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding
Easy Entry C64
D
Listings
Get it right ﬁrst time with our deluxe program system
for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
SS],[0
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line .
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine ke y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE august 1987
92
:CC=2*[Pi]*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

Commodore.
At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct it and

press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49152 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i t h  t h e  s ame SYS
command.
No system is  foolproof but the
chances o f  two errors cancelling one
another out are so remote that we
believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.
So get typing!

Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen ,it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how In ng
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of E6.00 for disk and E4.00 for cassette. None of the
documentation f o r  the programs is  supplied w ith the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:

TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Disk
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C I 6  and Plus /4
cassettes. However programs for these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available'?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple o f  symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:

This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.

Bug Finder
We'd like to remind our readers that
we run a Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one of our
programs and despite much checking,
you still can't get it to run, then send us
the following:
Two copies of your program on tape or
disk.
A description of your problem.
If possible a listing of your work (you
may omit this).
A stamped, self addressed envelope for
return of the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made errors and place a corrected
copy of the program back on to your
tape or disk before we return it to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it stops working. please check
it several times ﬁrst.
We d o  get a  large number o f
queries and so it may take a while for
us to deal with yours personally.
Note:we can only deal with problems
relating to programs published in Your

The Essential Package
Over there they call it Swift-Calc: over here
we just call it Swift. but whatever you call
it. its the most affordable and easy-to-use
professional quality Spreadsheet around!
The Americans have voted with their
wallets and made Swift one of the top ten
Home Management programs. according
to the highly respected Billboard chart. But
it's British, written by Dave Middleton of
Metamorphosis Developments, and
published in the UK by Audiogenic
Software.
Swift Spreadsheet is the essential ﬁnancial
modelling package. Use it in business, at
home, or in your club or society to help you
in budgetting, costing, quotations,
household ﬁnancial planning, or any task
where the manipulation of ﬁgures is
involved,
Swift will prove indispensable in
forecasting and decision making due to its
'What If' capabilities - it can show you
instantly how results are affected when you
change one or more of the contributory
factors.
Even if you haven't used a Spreadsheet
before, you will soon be able to harness
the power of Swift to your own special
requirements.
