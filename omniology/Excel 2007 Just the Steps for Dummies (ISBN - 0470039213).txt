W
elcome to the world of Microsoft Excel, the most popular and power-
ful spreadsheet program in the world. You may ask: “What is a
spreadsheet program?” A spreadsheet program is a computer program that
features a huge grid designed to display data in rows and columns. You can
use it to perform mathematical, logical, and other types of operations on the
data you enter. You can sort the data, enhance it, and manipulate it in a
plethora of ways — including creating powerful charts and graphs from it.
Whether you need a list of names and addresses or a document to calculate
next year’s sales revenue based on prior year’s performance, Excel is the
application you want to use. 
About This Book
This book provides the tools you need to successfully tackle the potentially
overwhelming challenge of learning to use Microsoft Excel. In this book, you
learn how to create spreadsheets; however, what you do with them is totally
up to you. Your imagination is the only limit! 
Why You Need This Book
Time is of the essence, and most of us don’t have the time to do a lot of
reading. We just need to get a task done effectively and efficiently. This book
is full of concise, easy-to-understand steps designed to get you quickly up
and running with Excel. It takes you directly to the steps for a desired task
without all the jibber-jabber that is often included in other books. 
Even if you’ve used Excel in the past, Excel 2007 brings many new features
and major changes to existing features. This book helps ease the transition
from the previous Excel version.

Excel 2007 Just the Steps For Dummies
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into 25 different chapters broken into 6
convenient parts:
Part I: Putting Excel to Work
In Chapter 1, you uncover the basics of working with Excel
files, such as opening, closing, and saving files. In Chapter 2,
you work with entering the different types of data into Excel
worksheets, and in Chapter 3, you create various types of 
formulas and functions to perform worksheet calculations.
Chapter 4 shows you how to protect your work with Excel’s
security features.
Part II: Sprucing Up Your Spreadsheets
Chapters 5 and 6 both show you how to dress up the data
you enter into a worksheet using data alignment, formatting
values, fonts, colors, and cell borders. In Chapter 7, you work
with graphics such as arrows and clip art. Then, in Chapter 8,
you begin to use workbooks consisting of multiple work-
sheets, hyperlinks, and cross references.
Part III: Viewing Data in Different Ways
This part, in four different chapters, shows how you can mod-
ify the way Excel displays certain workbook options on your
screen. Chapter 9 illustrates changing the worksheet views. In
Chapter 10, you sort your data to make it easier to locate par-
ticular pieces of information. Chapter 11 enables you to cre-
ate charts to display your data in a superb graphic manner.
Finally, in Chapter 12, you work with the different output
methods, including printing and e-mailing your worksheets.
Part IV: Analyzing Data with Excel
Use these chapters to effectively analyze all the data you 
input into a worksheet. In Chapters 13, 14, and 15, you work
with Excel Outlines, Filters, and Pivot Tables. Chapters 16 and
17 show some of the time-saving data-entry tools included
with Excel.
Part V: Utilizing Excel with Other 
People and Applications
Chapters 18 through 21 are all about sharing: sharing 
Excel with others by using Excel’s collaboration features, or
sharing Excel with Microsoft Office applications such as
Word, PowerPoint, and Access. 
Part VI: Practical Applications for Excel
Go to these chapters to save yourself time with a gorgeous
organization chart (Chapter 22), a commission calculation
worksheet (Chapter 23), or a medical-expense-tracking 
worksheet (Chapter 24). Chapter 25 helps you plan for your
future. You can use Excel to chart the path to purchase a
house, pay off your debts, and save for college or retirement.
Back cover: Using Excel Shortcut Keys
This helpful appendix shows you many shortcut keys that
make access to Excel functions faster and easier.

Working with 
Excel Files
I
n this book, you discover the new Excel interface that provides you with
the right tools at the right time. In most Windows programs, you see
menus and toolbars from which you select your options. Now you discover
the new Excel interface that provides you with the right tools at the right
time. Instead of the traditional look, Excel now provides tabs with icon-and
button-laden tabs on the Ribbon containing your favorite Excel features.
Galleries and themes are also a new addition to Excel, helping you maintain
consistency and style in workbook appearance. The Office Quick Access
toolbar, which is now the only toolbar, provides fast and easy access to basic
file functions. You discover later in this chapter how you can customize the
Quick Access toolbar. 
Throughout the course of this book, you discover methods to use Excel as a
spreadsheet, of course; but you also discover how to use it as a database, a
calculator, a planner, and even a graphic illustrator. You start with the basics
and work into the more advanced Excel actions. 
In this chapter you:
➟
Open and close the Excel program 
➟
Open, close, and save Excel workbooks
➟
Explore the Excel screen including customizing it to make it even
faster and easier to use. 
➟
Use workbook properties to better manage your files.
➟
Set Excel default file locations, which saves you time and frustration
when you open and save your workbooks.

Entering Spreadsheet
Data
E
xcel is a huge grid made up of columns and rows. If you’ve used previ-
ous versions of Microsoft Excel, you know the new spreadsheet is larger
than ever. A single worksheet now contains 16,384 columns (stretching
from column A to column XFD) and 1,048,576 rows.
You enter three types of data in the cells: 
➟
Labels are traditionally descriptive pieces of information such as
names, months, or other identifying statistics, and they usually
include alphabetic characters.
➟
Values are generally raw numbers or dates.
➟
Formulas are instructions for Excel to perform calculations.
In the first part of this chapter, I show you how to easily enter labels and
values into your worksheet. But, alas, human beings sometimes make mis-
takes or change their minds. So I also show you how to delete incorrect
entries, duplicate data, or move it to another area of the worksheet. You even
discover an Excel feature that prevents worksheet cells from accepting incor-
rect data.

Change the Active Cell
1.
Open a spreadsheet in Excel. The formula bar displays
the active cell location. Columns display the letters from
A to XFD and rows display numbers from 1 to 1048576.
A cell address is the intersection of a column and a row
such as D23 or AB205.
2.
Move the focus to an adjacent cell with one the follow-
ing techniques:
• Down: Press the Enter key or the down arrow key. 
• Up: Press the up arrow key.
• Right: Press the right arrow key 
• Left: Press the left arrow key.
3.
To move to a cell farther away, use one of these 
techniques: 
• Click the mouse pointer on any cell to move the
active cell location to that cell. You can use the scroll
bars to see more of the worksheet. In Figure 2-1, the
cell focus is in cell E10.
• Choose Home ➪Editing➪Find & Select➪Go To.
The Go To dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 2-2.
In the Reference box, enter the address of the cell you
want to make active and then click OK. 
Press the F5 key to display the Go To dialog box.
• Press Ctrl + Home. Excel jumps to cell A1.
• Press Ctrl + End. Excel jumps to the lower-right cell
of the worksheet.
• Press Ctrl + PageDown or Ctrl + PageUp. Excel
moves to the next or previous worksheet in the
workbook.

Enter Cell Data
1.
Type the label or value in the desired cell.
2.
Press Enter. The data is entered into the current cell and
Excel makes the next cell down active. (See Figure 2-3.)
How Excel aligns the data depends on what it is:
To enter a value as a label, type an apostrophe before the value.
• Label: Excel aligns the data to the left side of the cell.
If the descriptive information is too wide to fit, Excel
extends that data past the cell width if the next cell is
blank. If the next cell is not blank, Excel displays only
enough text to fit the display width. Widening the
column displays additional text.
• Whole value: If the data is a whole value such as 34 or
5763, Excel aligns the data to the right side of the cell.
• Value with a decimal: If the data is a decimal value,
Excel aligns the data to the right side of the cell, includ-
ing the decimal point, with the exception of a trailing
0. For example, in Figure 2-4, if you enter 246.75, then
246.75 displays; if you enter 246.70, however, 246.7
displays. (See Chapter 5 to change the display appear-
ance, column width, and alignment of your data.)
If a value displays as scientific notation or number sign, it means
the value is too long to fit into the cell. You need to widen the col-
umn width. 
• Date: If you enter a date, such 12/3, Dec 3, or 3 Dec,
Excel automatically returns 03-Dec in the cell, but the
formula bar displays 12/03/2006. Figure 2-4 also
illustrates an example of date entry. See Chapter 5 to
change the date format.

Extend a Series with AutoFill
1.
Type the first cell of data with data such as a day or
month, such as Wednesday or September. AutoFill works
with days of the week, months of the year, or yearly
quarters such as 2nd Qtr. You can enter the entire word
or you can enter the abbreviated form (Wed or Sep).
2.
Press Enter.
3.
Position the mouse pointer on the small black box at
the lower-right corner of the data cell. Your mouse
pointer turns into a small black cross. (See Figure 2-11.)
To AutoFill a series of numbers, enter two values in two adjacent
cells, such as 1 and 2 or 5 and 10. Select both cells, and then use
the AutoFill box to highlight cells. Excel continues the series as 3, 4,
5, or 5, 10, 15, and so forth.
4.

Building Formulas
T
his chapter is all about the math. With Excel, you can create formulas to
perform calculations. The calculations can be simple, such as adding 2
plus 3, or they can be extremely complex, such as those used to calculate
depreciation. But don’t despair; you don’t have to do most of the work.
Excel includes more than 335 built-in calculations, which are called
functions, in 11 different categories. Functions contain arguments, which
appear in parentheses following the function’s name. The arguments are the
details you provide to Excel to indicate which numbers to calculate in the
function. Some functions require several arguments to function correctly,
but again I say, don’t worry; Excel contains a Function Wizard to walk you
through the entire process.
The primary tasks in this chapter include:
➟
Creating simple and complex formulas by typing them into a cell.
➟
Analyzing data with Excel’s time-saving functions.
➟
Creating cell ranges separated by colons for a sequential cell selection
or by commas to list specific cell locations.
➟
Evaluating formula errors and locating a cell’s precedents and 
dependents.

Create Simple Formulas 
with Operators
1.
Enter values in two different cells; remember, however,
formulas do not need to reference cell addresses. They
can contain actual numbers.
2.
In the cell where you want to perform the calculation
for the two values, type an equal sign (=). All Excel for-
mulas begin with an equal sign. 
3.
Click or type the first cell address or type the first value
you want to include in the formula. In the example in
Figure 3-1, I’m adding two cell references (B5 and B6)
together. 
Excel displays a color border that surrounds the cell reference you
enter.
4.
Type an operator. Operators can include:
• The plus sign (+) 
• The minus sign (–)
• The asterisk (*) to multiply
• The slash (/) to divide
• The percentage symbol (%)
• The exponentiation symbol (^)
5.
Type the second cell address or the second value you
want to include in the formula. 
6.
Press Enter and Excel displays the results of the calcula-
tion in the selected cell. (See Figure 3-2.)
The formula bar at the top displays the actual formula.
Formulas can have multiple references. For example, =B5+B6+B6+B8
is a legitimate formula. Formulas with multiple operators are called
compound formulas.
Figure 3-1: All formulas begin with an equal sign.
Figure 3-2: A simple formula.
➟
28
Chapter 3: Building Formulas

Create Compound Formulas
1.
Type values in three or more different cells.
2.
Select the cell where you want the formula.
3.
Type the equal sign and then the first cell reference.
4.
Type the first operator and then the second cell reference.
5.
Type the second operator and then the third cell reference. 
Compound formulas are not limited to three references, and you
can use cell references multiple times in a compound formula. 
6.
Press Enter. Excel displays the results of the calculation
in the selected cell. The actual formula appears in the
formula bar. (See Figure 3-3.)
If you were paying attention in your high school algebra class, you
might remember the Rule of Priorities. In a compound formula,
Excel calculates multiplication and division before it calculates addi-
tion and subtraction. This means that you must include parentheses
for any portion of a formula you want calculated first. As an exam-
ple, in Figure 3-4, you see that the formula 3+5*2 gives a
result of 13, but (3+5)*2 gives a result of 16.
You can include range names in formulas such as =D23*
CommissionRate where a specific cell is named
CommissionRate. See Chapter 2 about using range
names.
Compound formulas can have multiple combinations in parentheses
and can contain any combination of operators and references. A for-
mula might read ((B5+C5)/2)*SalesTax. This
formula adds B5 and C5, divides that result by 2, and then mul-
tiplies that result times the value in the cell named SalesTax. 
A great tool to review formulas is the capability to display the actual for-
mula in the worksheet rather than the formula result. Choose Formulas➪
Formula Auditing➪Show Formulas. Click the Show Formulas button
again to return to the formula result.

Add Numbers with AutoSum
1.
Click the cell beneath a sequential list of values.
2.
Click Formulas➪Function Library➪AutoSum. Excel
places a marquee (marching ants) around the cells
directly above the current cell. (See Figure 3-5.)
3.
Press the Enter key to display the sum total of the
selected cells. 
Find an Average Value
1.
After selecting the cell beneath a sequential list of val-
ues, click the arrow beneath the AutoSum button. Excel
displays a list of calculation options, including (see
Figure 3-6):
• Average. Calculated by adding a group of numbers
and then dividing by the count of those numbers.
• Count Numbers. Counts the number of cells in a
specified range that contain numbers.
• Max. Determines the highest value in a specified range.
• Min. Determines the lowest value in a specified range.
2.
Choose Average. A marquee appears around the group
of cells. Highlight a different group of cells if necessary.
3.
Press Enter. The selected cell displays the average value
of the cell group.
Figure 3-5: Using the AutoSum function.
Figure 3-6: Selecting 
the Average function.
If the cells directly above the current cell have no values, Excel selects
the cells directly to the left of the current cell. If you want to add a group
of different cells, highlight them.
The formula bar displays the formula beginning with the equal sign and
the word SUM. The selected cells appear in parentheses, the first and
last cells separated by a colon.

Copy Formulas with AutoFill
1.
Position the mouse on the AutoFill box in the lower-
right corner of a cell with a formula. Make sure the
mouse pointer turns into a black cross.
2.
Click and drag the AutoFill box to include the cells to
which you want to copy the formula. (See Figure 3-7.)
The AutoFill method of copying formulas is helpful if
you’re copying a formula to surrounding cells.
Copied formulas are slightly different than the originals because of
the relative change in position. For example, if the formula in cell
D23 is B23+C23 and you copy the formula to the next cell
down, to cell D24, Excel automatically changes the formula to
B24+C24. If you do not want the copied formula to change,
you must make the originating formula an absolute formula (see
the “Define an Absolute Formula” section later in this chapter).
Edit a Formula
1.
Double-click the cell containing the formula you want
to edit. The cell expands to show the formula instead of
the result. (See Figure 3-8.)
Optionally, press the F2 key to expand the formula so you can edit it. 
2.
Use the arrow keys to navigate to the character you want
to change.
3.
Using the Backspace key, delete any unwanted characters
and type any additional characters. 
4.
Press Enter. 
Press the Delete key to delete the entire formula and start over.

Edit a Formula

Define an Absolute Formula 
1.
To prevent a formula from changing a cell reference
as you copy it to a different location, you lock in an
absolute cell reference using one of these methods: 
• Lock in a cell location: Type a dollar sign in front
of both the column reference and the row reference
(as in $C$2). If the original formula in cell F5 is
=E5*$C$2, and you copy the formula to cell F6, the
copied formula reads E6*=$C$2 instead of E6*C3,
which is how it would read were it not absolute. (See
Figure 3-9.)
• Lock in the row or column location only: Type a
dollar sign in front of the column reference ($C2)
or in front of the row reference (C$2).
2.
Copy the formula, as needed, to other locations. Notice
that the absolute cell reference in the original formula
remains unchanged in the copied formulas. 
Copy Values Using Paste Special
1.
Select a cell (or group of cells) containing a formula and
then choose Home➪Clipboard➪Copy. A marquee
appears around the selected cell.

Troubleshoot Formula Errors
1.
Choose Formulas➪Formula Auditing➪Error Checking.
If Excel finds potential formula errors in your worksheet,
it jumps to the cell containing the error and displays the
Error Checking dialog box shown in Figure 3-15. If the
worksheet contains no errors, Excel displays a message
box saying the error-checking is complete. Here are just
a few of the error types Excel might locate:
• DIV/0!: Divide by zero error. This error means the
formula is trying to divide by either an empty cell or
one with a value of zero. Make sure all cells referenced
in the division have a value other than zero in them.
• #VALUE!: This means the formula references an
invalid cell address. For example, text is in a cell
where the formula is expecting to find a value. You
might also see this error if you delete a value in a cell
that was used in a formula. Locate and correct the
invalid cell reference.
• NAME#: This occurs when Excel doesn’t recognize text
in a formula, perhaps because of a misspelling of a
range name. Make sure the name actually exists and
is spelled correctly. Also verify the spelling of the
function name.
• Circular: This means that the formula in a cell is
referring to itself. Locate the circular reference and
edit the formula so it does not include itself. Figure
3-16 shows a circular reference.
• Number Stored as Text: This means a cell
contains what looks like a value, but the content is
stored as text. Verify that you did intend to store the
value as a text entry.
Figure 3-15: Let Excel find potential formula errors.

Troubleshoot Formula Errors

• Formula Omits Adjacent Cells: This
means a formula refers to a group of cells that have
numbers adjacent to it. Study the formula to make
sure you didn’t forget to include additional cell refer-
ences in the formula.
2.
Perform one of the following steps, depending on the
error type:
• Click in the cell and edit the formula as needed. Click
Resume when you are finished.
• Click Ignore Error to jump to the next potential 
problem.
• Click an option, if available, to allow the Error
Checking dialog box to assist you with repairing
the problem.
3.
Click Next to review the next problem area. When
the error-check process is complete, Excel displays a
message box.
4.
Click OK.
Identify Formula Precedents 
and Dependents
1.
Select a cell that contains a formula or one that is refer-
enced in one or more formulas.
2.
Choose Formulas➪Formula Auditing➪Trace Precedents
or Trace Dependents. Excel displays one or more blue
arrows pointing out either precedents or, as shown in
Figure 3-18, dependents.
3.
Click Remove Arrows. The blue arrows disappear.
Figure 3-17: Show formulas instead of results.
Figure 3-18: Tracer arrows indicate formula precedents or dependents.
To help you determine the nature or origin of the problem, some error
messages have a Show Calculation Steps button to display the logic
behind the formula.
Another great troubleshooting tool is the capability to display the actual
formula, instead of the result, in the worksheet. Choose
Formulas➪Formula Auditing➪Show Formulas. Click the same button
again to return to the formula result. (See Figure 3-17.)
Dependent cells are those that are referred to by a formula in another
cell. Precedent cells are those that contain formulas that refer to other
cells.

orksheets often contain numerical information that is confidential in
nature, such as financial or payroll data. In today’s world of elec-
tronic snooping, it’s up to you to protect your work against prying eyes.
Fortunately, Excel provides a large number of security tools such as password
protection, hiding sensitive worksheet areas, or locking data against
unwanted changes.
This chapter is about the security concerns surrounding Excel workbooks. I’ll
show you many distinctive protection methods including how to: 
➟
Hide all or selected areas of a workbook
➟
Specify that users can view a file but not modify it
➟
Restrict the access to designated worksheet ranges
➟
Mark a file as final to protect it from changes
➟
Assign passwords to open or modify a workbook
➟
Remove private data from a workbook before sending it on to others.

Formatting Cells 
W
hoever said “Looks aren’t everything” wasn’t staring at an unformat-
ted Excel spreadsheet. Columns often aren’t wide enough, fonts are
too small to read, dates display in an unusual manner, and when columns
of data are stacked next to each other, sometimes the information overlaps.
Fortunately, Excel includes a plethora of features to make your data more
presentable and easier to read. In fact, it has so many appearance-altering
features, I had to break them up into two chapters! After you master the
Excel formatting features in this chapter, you can.
➟
Change the font type, size, and style of text, values, or dates.
➟
Change the alignment of data in a cell from the standard left-aligned
for text and right-aligned for values or dates.
➟
Turn values into currency or percentages.
➟
Create titles using the Excel Merge and Center button.
➟

Format Values
1.
Select the cells you want to format. You can select a few
cells, entire rows, entire columns, or the entire work-
sheet. (See Chapter 3 for information on selecting mul-
tiple cells.)
2.
Choose Home➪Number➪Number Format. A list of
options appears. Figure 5-1 shows values formatted in
various Excel styles. Notice the different dollar sign
placement in the Accounting and Currency types.
The Number group on the Ribbon also displays three icons you can
use to quickly format as Accounting, Percentages, or Comma. The
Accounting option has a drop-down list from which you can select dif-
ferent international currency symbols. Percentages add a percent sign
and no decimal points. The Comma option adds two decimal places
and a comma between the thousands. It does not include a dollar
sign. 
3.
To remove digits to the right of the decimal point, choose
Home➪Number➪Decrease Decimal. To add decimal dig-
its, click the Increase Decimal button. Each click adds or
removes a number to the far right of the decimal point
and rounds the value in the cell. See Figure 5-2.
If you see a cell with values displaying ######, you need to widen
the column width. See the next section.
Another method to select number formatting is using the Number
dialog box launcher, which displays the Format Cells dialog box.
Number format selections are on the Number tab.
Excel numbers can display up to 30 decimal places.

Chapter 5: Formatting Cells

Adjust Column Width 
1.
To adjust the width of columns headings, highlight the
ones to be widened. If you want to adjust a single col-
umn, click any cell in that column.
If your worksheet contains many numbers, you can widen the
columns to make the worksheet less cluttered. Columns that espe-
cially need widening are those containing cells with truncated text
entries or numbers that Excel shows as ######. 
2.
Choose a method to adjust column width:
• To manually change the width of columns, position
the mouse pointer on the right boundary of the col-
umn heading until it turns into a double-ended
arrow. Drag until the column is the width that you
want. As you move the pointer, a balloon message
displays the new width. In Figure 5-3, I’m expanding
column A. 
Excel displays cell width in characters and pixels instead of in
inches. The minimum column width is 0 characters and the maxi-
mum is 255 characters.
• To set column width to a specific setting, choose
Home➪Cells➪Format➪Width. The Column Width
dialog box, shown in Figure 5-4, appears. Type the
exact width you want; then click OK. 
• To automatically change the column width so it fits
the widest entry, double-click the boundary on the
right side of the column heading or choose Home➪
Cells➪Format➪AutoFit Selection. Excel sets the width
slightly larger than the longest entry in the column.
Figure 5-3: Manually changing column width.
The default column width is 8.43 based on the default 11-point Calibri
font. If you change the default font type or size, Excel may also change
the standard column width. You can manually set a default column width
by choosing Home➪Cells➪Format➪Standard Width.
Figure 5-4: Set a specific column width.
➟

Adjust Column Width

Change Row Height 
1.
Highlight the row headings whose height you want to
adjust. If you want to adjust a single row, click any cell
in that row.
2.
Choose a method to adjust row height:
• To manually change the row height, position the
mouse pointer on the bottom boundary of the row
heading until it turns into a double-ended arrow.
Drag until the row is the height that you want. As
you move the pointer, a balloon message displays the
new height. In Figure 5-5, I’m increasing the height
of rows 1 and 2. 
Excel displays row height in characters and pixels instead of in
inches. 
• To set row height to a specific setting, choose Home➪
Cells➪Format➪Height. The Row Height dialog box,
shown in Figure 5-6 appears. Type the exact width
you want; then click OK. 
• To automatically change the height of the row so it
fits the tallest entry in the row, double-click the
boundary on the bottom of the row heading or
choose Home➪Cells➪Format➪AutoFit. Excel exam-
ines the rows contents and sets the height slightly
larger than the tallest entry.
The default row height is 15 based on the default 11-point Calibri
font. If you change the default font type or size, Excel may also
change the standard row height. You cannot manually set a default
row height.

Align Data Horizontally 
and Vertically
1.
Select the cells you want to align.
2.
Choose Home➪Alignment; then, select one of these
alignment buttons: 
• Align Left: Horizontally aligns the data along the left
edge of the cell.
• Center: Centers the data horizontally in the middle
of the cell. If you modify the column width, the data
remains centered to the new column width. Cells B4
through G4 are center-aligned in Figure 5-7.
• Align Right: Horizontally aligns the data along the
right edge of the cell.
Values formatted as Accounting can only display as right-aligned.
You can change alignment on all other formatting styles.
• Top Align: Aligns the data vertically along the top
edge of the cell.
• Middle Align: Centers the data vertically in the cell. 
• Bottom Align: This is the default option and aligns
the data along the bottom edge of the cell. Notice the
heading in Figure 5-8. Row 1 shows a top vertical
alignment, whereas row 2 shows the default bottom
alignment.
Optionally, you can view additional alignment options and align both
the horizontal and vertical alignment at the same time using the
Format Cells dialog box. From the Home tab, click the Alignment
group dialog box launcher. If necessary, click the Alignment tab and
then set any desired alignment options; then click OK.

Create a Title by Merging Cells 
1.
Select the cell containing the data you want to merge
and the cells you want to include in the merge. The data
cell must be in the left cell of the selection and the other
cells cannot contain data. This is shown in Figure 5-9.
2.
Choose Home➪Alignment➪Merge and Center. All the
selected cells merge into one larger cell, and the data is
horizontally centered.
If you select cells vertically and choose the Merge and Center com-
mand, Excel merges the cells and vertically bottom-aligns the data.
After clicking Merge and Center, you can change the alignment.
Click the Merge and Center button again to unmerge the cells from
each other.
Change Font Color
1.
Select the cells you want to format.
2.
Choose Home➪Font and click the Font Color drop-
down arrow to select a color. Again, Excel’s Live Preview
feature, as you see in Figure 5-10, shows you the selected
cells in the new font colors. 
Click More Colors to display the Colors dialog box from which you
can select additional colors as well as create your own custom color.
Another method to select Font color is through the Font dialog box
launcher, which displays the Format Cells dialog box. Font color
selection is on the Font tab.

Place Borders around Cells
1.
To add a border, select the appropriate cells.
2.
Choose Home➪Font and then click the arrow next to
the Borders button. A variety of border options, as you
see in Figure 6-3, appears.
The Borders tooltip button may display Bottom Border, Top Border,
or whatever border was last used.
3.
Select the border you want. Excel applies the border to
the selected cells.
For more border styles, colors, and options, click the More Borders
option to open the Format Cells dialog box.
Work with Date Formats
1.
Enter a date into a cell. Depending on what you type,
Excel probably displays the date in a different format.
Figure 6-4 illustrates some date examples.
Dates are actually numeric values, and you can use them in Excel
calculations. See the next section.
2.
From the Home tab, click the Number dialog box
launcher, which displays the Format Cells dialog box.
3.
Click the Date category. The right side of the screen dis-
plays a variety of different date formats.
4.
Select a format for the selected cells.
5.
Click OK.
Optionally, click Short Date or Long Date from the Number Format drop-
down list in the Number group on the Home tab.

Work with Date Formats

Use Dates in a Calculation
1.
Enter a date into a cell. You can format the date any way
you want.
2.
Enter another date into another cell.
To have the cell dynamically display the current date, enter
=Now(). To enter today’s date as a static entry, press Ctrl+;
(semicolon). To enter the current time as a static value, press Ctrl+:
(colon).
3.
To find the difference between the two dates, create a
formula that subtracts one date from another. For exam-
ple, if you put the first date in cell A1 and the other date
in cell A2, then in cell A3 or wherever you want the dif-
ference to appear, enter =A1-A2. Excel returns a value,
but it is formatted in a date pattern rather than in a
numerical pattern (which is what you want). Your answer
probably looks something like what you see in Figure 6-5.
To calculate the number of days between a specific date and the
present time, enter the specific date in a cell such as A1 and then in
another cell enter the formula =A1-NOW().
4.
With the answer cell (A3) selected, choose
Home➪Font➪Number Format.
5.
Select Number. Excel changes the date value to a numer-
ical value. (See Figure 6-6.)
The reason Excel initially returned an unusual date is that dates are
really serialized values beginning with day 0 at December 31, 1899.
When you create a formula involving date formats, Excel naturally
returns a date format. In the Figure 6-6, the first formula resulted in
1/10/1900, which is 10 days after December 31, 1899. Therefore,
there are 10 days between the values in cells C4 andB4.

formatted value.

Copy Formatting
1.
Click a cell containing formatting you want to copy.
2.
Choose Home➪Clipboard➪Format Painter. The mouse
pointer is a white plus sign along with a paintbrush like
the one you see in Figure 6-7.
3.
Click or drag across the cells you want to format. Excel
immediately applies formats such as font, size, colors,
borders, and alignment.
Double-click the Format Painter tool to lock it in so you can paint
additional cells without having to reselect the tool. Click the Format
Painter tool again to unlock it.
To quickly copy the width of one column to another column, select the
heading of the first column, click the Format Painter tool, and then click
the heading of the column where you want to apply the column width.
Indent Data in Cells
1.
Select the cells you want to indent.
2.
Choose Home➪Alignment➪Increase Indent. Each Increase
Indent click adds a small amount of space between the
cell border and the data itself. (See Figure 6-8.) How
Excel indents depends on how you format the cell:
• If the data is left-aligned, Excel indents to the left.
• If the data is right-aligned, Excel indents to the right.
• If the data is centered, with the first click, Excel
indents to the right; but subsequent clicks cause
Excel to move the data to the left.
Click the Decrease Indent button to remove indentation.

Specify Conditional Formatting
1.
Select the cells to which you want to apply conditional
formatting.
Reasons for using conditional formatting might include locating
dates that meet a certain condition (such as falling on a Saturday
or Sunday), specifying highest or lowest values in a range, or indi-
cating values that fall under or over a specified amount.
2.
Choose Home➪Styles➪Conditional Formatting➪
Highlight Cell Rules.
3.
Select the criteria you want to use. Criteria options
include Greater Than, Less Than, Between, Equal To,
Text That Contains, A Date Occurring, and Duplicate
Values. A dialog box opens, where you can specify the
value. In Figure 6-11, in order to see which items went
over budget, you use the Greater Than criteria.
4.
Enter the values you want to reference in the text box.
The number of boxes depends on the criteria you
selected in Step 3. You can type a value here, such as
500, or you can reference a cell address such as F13. 
5.
Click the drop-down arrow next to the format options
so you can specify the format options to employ if the
condition you specified is true. Live Preview shows you
what your data will look like.
Click the Custom Format option, where you can create your own for-
mat, selecting from font styles and color, numeric and other for-
mats, borders, patterns, or background color. 
6.
Click OK. In Figure 6-12, you see formatting options
applied to seven cells that meet the specified criteria of
being greater than 0 (meaning, in this example, items
over budget).

3.
Select from the following options. (Figure 6-13 shows
an example of all three data visualizations.)
• Data Bars: A gradient-style bar helps you see the
value of a cell relative to other cells. The length of the
data bar represents the value in the cell, so a longer
bar represents a higher value and a shorter bar repre-
sents a lower value. The data bars have six different
color options designed to match Excel themes.
• Color Scales: Designed to visually help you under-
stand your data, color scales compare a range of cells
by using two colors representing higher or lower val-
ues or three colors representing higher, middle, or
lower values. The color scale bars come in eight dif-
ferent color themes, including red, yellow, and green.
You can also create your own scheme by choosing
More Rules under the Color Scales options.
• Icon Sets: Icon sets help you classify data into three,
four, or five categories with each icon representing a
range of values such as higher, middle, and lower. As
shown in Figure 6-14, icon sets include arrows, traffic
lights, clocks, and even smiley faces.
The icon size you see depends on the cell font size. You may need
to adjust the column width to accommodate the icon.

S
ometimes, even after adding font and style attributes to cell data, you
still want to call extra attention to specific areas. Maybe you’d like to
add an arrow to point to a specific area. What? You can’t draw a straight
line? That’s not a problem because with Excel, you don’t have to be a gifted
artist to draw.
Whether you want to draw circles, squares, lines, or arrows, Excel provides
tools to assist you, making the drawing process fun and easy.
In this chapter, you discover how to:
➟
Draw arrows, shapes, and annotation boxes, plus add depth to your
art using shading and dimension.
➟
Insert clip art, which is a collection of ready-made, computerized
graphic illustrations.
➟
Insert a photograph or your company logo, making your viewers sit
up and take notice of your worksheet.
➟
Use WordArt, stylized text objects, which add pizzazz to your 
worksheet.
➟
Manipulate and manage all the above mentioned graphic objects —
by moving, resizing, cropping, rotating, recoloring, and using many
other options.

Managing Workbooks
L
et’s begin by clearing up a couple of terms. A worksheet, sometimes
called a spreadsheet, is a collection of cells that can have more than 1
million rows down and more than 16,000 rows across. Each cell of each
sheet can contain more than 32,000 characters. 
Secondly, a workbook is a collection of worksheets. By default, each time you
create a new Excel workbook, it contains three worksheets. Each workbook
however, can have an almost unlimited number of worksheets, limited only
by your computer memory. The resulting possible number of cells in a sin-
gle workbook is too huge to even dream about, but the fact remains you
could create a single huge workbook. Realistically, however, you’ll probably
have a number of different workbooks, each with a number of worksheets. 
Excel makes it easy to work with multiple worksheets. You can maneuver
between the sheets by clicking a sheet tab. It even provides navigation but-
tons for situations when you have a lot of tabs. This chapter is primarily
about working with multiple sheets. You discover how to insert, delete,
move, and copy worksheets, rename the tabs that reference them, and create
formulas that reference other worksheets or workbooks. 
Finally, you discover how to create hyperlinks to jump to Web sites, other
cells, or workbooks and how to create an instant e-mail.

Generate References 
to Other Worksheets
1.
Select the cell into which you want to enter a reference.
2.
Perform one of the following actions:
• To display a value located in another cell on the same
worksheet, type the equal sign and then the cell
address. For example, type =B45. If the value in 
B45 changes, the cell with the reference to B45 also
changes.
• To display a value located in a cell on a different work-
sheet but in the same workbook, type the equal sign.
Next, click the worksheet tab containing the cell you
want to reference and then click the actual cell you
want to reference. Press the Enter key. Excel displays
the equal sign, the worksheet name, an exclamation
point, and the cell reference. (See Figure 8-9.)
• To include a cell located on a different worksheet but
in the same workbook in a formula, begin to type the
formula. In the place where you want to position the
distant cell reference, click the worksheet containing
the cell and then click the actual cell. Follow this
with the remainder of the formula. Figure 8-10 illus-
trates an example of a formula using a reference to a
different worksheet.
Formulas referencing other worksheets or other workbooks can
also be compound formulas or used in a function.

Cross-Reference Other Workbooks
1.
Open the workbook to which you will refer. For simplic-
ity sake, call this Workbook2.
2.
Click the desired cell in the workbook where you want
to create a reference. Call this Workbook1.
3.
In Workbook1, begin the formula or reference with an
equal sign.
4.
If using a function or formula, enter any portion that
you want to precede the cross reference.
5.
Click the cell that you want to reference from
Workbook2.
6.
Finish the remainder of the formula or press the Enter
key. Excel displays the equal sign, an apostrophe, and
then the Workbook2 filename in brackets followed by the
worksheet name, a closing apostrophe, an exclamation
point, and then, the absolute cell reference. For example,
[Sales.xls]January’!$E$10 refers to the value in cell E10 
of the sheet January in the Excel file named Sales. See
Figure 8-11 for an example of a cross reference.
Excel uses absolute references (with dollar signs) when referring to
other workbooks.
• When you open a workbook containing a cross refer-
ence, Excel displays a message such as the one shown
in Figure 8-12, prompting you with a security alert 
so it can determine whether to update the cross-
referenced cell. Click Enable Contents if you want
Excel to check the originating workbook for changes
to the referenced cell. You may see another confirma-
tion message.

omeone once wrote about the importance of seeing and being seen.
Although I’m sure that quote referred to people, it also can apply to
your Excel worksheets. You need to see them in many different contexts.
That’s what this chapter is about — seeing your workbook from different
perspectives by using the following techniques:
➟
Viewing alternatives such as zooming in or out, displaying page
breaks, or seeing the worksheet without the Ribbon and other screen
elements.
➟
Splitting the screen to see multiple sections of a worksheet at the same
time or viewing multiple worksheets together. 
➟
Freezing portions of a worksheet so you can see category or row 
headings. 
➟
Comparing two spreadsheets on the screen.
➟
Creating templates that can bring consistency, such as the company
standards or personal preferences, to your workbooks.
➟
Monitoring specific cells for changes.

Sorting Data
S
ometimes worksheets become quite large, making locating particular
pieces of information time-consuming and difficult. If your data is in 
an array, you may find the data easier to view if it is sorted in a particular
manner.
Perhaps you have multiple worksheets, and you want to locate every occur-
rence of a specific value. Or, maybe you’re just a neat freak and want every-
thing to be in a particular order. Excel contains features to help your arrange
your worksheets in an easy-to-manage sequence.
In this chapter, you discover how to:
➟
Sort your data in ascending or descending order using either the tool-
bar or the Excel Sort dialog box.
➟
Perform a secondary sort if the primary sort has multiple matches.
➟
Sort data containing days of the week or month names.
➟
Create a customized list of frequently used names or terms.
➟
Locate cells containing data you specify, whether the data is part of a
formula or a resulting cell value.
➟
Quickly replace data containing certain information with another
specified set of data.
➟
Locate all cells with a particular style of formatting and easily replace
them with a different format.

Use the Toolbar to Sort
1.
For the easiest sorting, create a list in contiguous order
and with headings specifying the contents of each col-
umn. Figure 10-1 illustrates an ideal data array.
2.
In the column you want to sort by, click any cell con-
taining data. 
If the data is in a connected list, you do not have to select it first. If
it’s not, you must first select the entire list. If Excel finds unselected
data in columns next to the selected data, it may prompt you for
more information.
3.
Choose Data➪Sort & Filter➪Sort A to Z. (If the current
cell contains a value, the button says Sort Smallest to
Largest.) Excel sorts the entire list in ascending order. 
Sorting text data in ascending order sorts text A-Z; sorting numeric
information in ascending order sorts low to high (1-10); and sort-
ing dates in ascending order places the earliest date first.
Excel sorts in the following pattern: numbers, spaces, special char-
acters which are ! “ # $ % & ( ) * , . / : ; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~ +
< = > and, finally, alphabetic letters. 
4.
Choose Data➪Sort & Filter➪Sort Z to A (or Largest to
Smallest). Excel sorts the entire list by descending order.
Figure 10-2 shows the Name column sorted in descend-
ing order (from highest to lowest).
If Excel incorrectly sorts a cell that contains a value, make sure the
cell is formatted as a number and not as text. 
Sorting text data in descending order sorts text Z-A; sorting numeric
information in descending order sorts high to low (10-1); and sort-
ing dates in descending order places the latest date first.

also sort by columns (left to right). In the Sort dialog box, click the
Options button and then, under the Orientation section, choose Sort
left to right. Finally, click OK. 
4.
Set up the primary sort criteria as in the previous section.
Excel sorts dates formatted with slashes such as 11/22/68, as
numeric data. Dates with the day or month spelled out must be sorted
differently. See the later section, “Sort by Day, Month, or Custom
List.”
5.
Click the Add Level button.
6.
In the Then By section, select the secondary column you
want to sort by if two or more items are identical in the
first Sort By option. See Figure 10-5.
7.
Select how you want to sort the second data criteria.
Repeat as needed.
To delete an entry, select the sort entry and choose Delete Level.
You must keep at least one sort entry in the list.
8.
Click OK. Excel performs the sort process. Figure 10-6
illustrates data rows sorted first by State and then by City.
Figure 10-5: Select a second sort criteria.
During an Excel sort, apostrophes (‘) and hyphens (-) are ignored,
unless two text strings are the same except for a hyphen. In that situa-
tion, the text with the hyphen is sorted as the latter.

Creating Charts
W
hoever said a picture is worth a thousand words is most certainly
referring to a chart. Let’s face it. . . we like looking at pictures more
than we like looking at sheets of data. Charts, sometimes referred to as
graphs, provide an effective way to illustrate your worksheet data by making
the relationships between numbers easier to see. The chart turns numbers
into shapes and enables you to compare the shapes to each other.
If you’ve ever spent hours drawing a chart on graph paper, you’ll really
appreciate the ease with which you can create dozens of different chart styles
using your Excel data. And you don’t really have to draw a thing! With just a
few decisions on your part and a few clicks of the mouse, you have a two- or
three-dimensional illustration of your data.
Charts let you get your thoughts across with simplicity and strength and,
because different charts may cause you to draw varied conclusions, they also
prod you to ask questions about what you are seeing. Whatever the idea you
are trying to convey, charts make it easier.

Create a Basic Chart
1.
Select the data (sequential or nonsequential) you want
to plot in the chart. See Figure 11-1 for an example of
sequential data selected for a chart.
2.
Press the F11 key. Excel immediately adds a new sheet
called Chart1 to your workbook with the data plotted
into a column chart. Each subsequent chart page is
numbered sequentially such as Chart2, Chart3, and so
forth. Figure 11-2 shows you the various elements that
can make up a chart.
Some newer keyboards use a different function for the F11 key. 
If your F11 key does not produce a chart, use the Insert tab as
explained in the next section.
Throughout this chapter you learn how to edit the look and style of
a chart.
• Title: A descriptive name for the overall chart. By
default, titles are not added in a basic chart, but you
can add them later manually or by using the Chart
Wizard.
• X or Category axis: Column or row headings from
your selected data, which Excel uses for Category axis
names. In a column chart, the categories display
along the bottom. In other charts (such as a bar
chart), the category axis displays along the left side.
• X Axis Title: A descriptive name for the Category axis.
By default, a category label is not added in a basic
chart, but you can add one later manually or with the
Chart Wizard.
Figure 11-1: Select data for a chart.
Figure 11-2: Viewing chart basics.
➟

Chapter 11: Creating Charts

• Y or Value axis: A scale representing the zero or the
lowest and highest numbers in the plotted data. The
Value axis is usually located on the left side on a col-
umn chart or on the bottom on a bar chart.
• Y Axis Title: A descriptive name for the values. By
default, a value label is not added in a basic chart,
but you can add one later manually or by using the
Chart Wizard.
• Legend: The box, usually located on the right, identi-
fies the patterns or colors that are assigned to the
chart data series. Notice in Figure 11-3 how the leg-
end explains that one shade of color represents
January, another shade is for February, and the third
color shade is for March.
• Tick marks: The small extensions of lines that appear
outside of the gray area and represent divisions of the
value or category axis.
• Gridlines: These lines extend from the tick marks
across the chart area to allow you to easily view and
evaluate data.
• Series: Excel uses the worksheet cell values to gener-
ate the series. Each element, called a data marker, 
represents a single worksheet cell value. Related data
markers make up a data series and have the same 
pattern or color. In Figure 11-4, you can see the com-
parison of the data values to the y-axis and the series
values.
• Plot area: The background that represents the entire
plotted chart area.
To delete this chart, right-click the Chart tab and select Delete. When
Excel asks for a confirmation, click Delete again.

Create a Basic Chart

Insert a Chart 
1.
Select the data you want to plot in the chart. 
Typically, if you are selecting values such as monthly figures, you
don’t want to include totals in your chart.
2.
Choose Insert➪Charts, and then select the arrow
beneath the chart style you want: Excel can create many
different chart types; each compares data in a different
manner. (See Figure 11-5.) Some of the most commonly
used chart types include the following: 
• Column: Column charts compare values to cate-
gories using a series of vertical columns to illustrate
the series.
• Bar: Bar charts, like column charts, compare values to
categories, but use a series of horizontal bars to illus-
trate the series.
• Line: Line charts are similar to bar charts but use dots
to represent the data points and lines to connect the
data points.
• Pie: This chart compares parts to a whole. Usually a
pie chart only has one data series. Figure 11-6 illus-
trates data appropriate for a pie chart.
• Area: Area charts display the trend of each value, usu-
ally over a specified period of time.
• X-Y Scatter: These charts include two value axes, one
showing a set of numerical data along the x-axis and
the other showing data along the y-axis.

➟
104
Chapter 11: Creating Charts

• Surface: Shows trends in values in a continuous
curve.
• Doughnut: Displays data similarly to a pie chart; it
compares parts to a whole, but contains multiple
series.
• Stock: Stock charts are usually (but not exclusively)
used to illustrate the fluctuation of stock prices. In a
stock chart, the data order is very important and usu-
ally the row headings are High, Low, and Close; or
Open, High, Low, and Close. See Figure 11-7 for an
example of a stock chart.
• Radar: Displays changes in values relative to a center
point by comparing the cumulative values of multi-
ple data series.
• Bubble: These charts are similar to scatter charts, but
compare three sets of values by displaying a series of
circles.
• Cylinder, Cone, and Pyramid: Excel uses these three
chart types to create a column or bar chart using
three-dimensional cylindrical, conical, or pyramid
shapes.
3.
Choose a chart subtype. Depending on the chart type,
some chart subtypes show the data series next to each
other; others show the data elements stacked on top of
each other. Some charts are two-dimensional, and oth-
ers are three-dimensional. As you see in Figure 11-8,
Excel creates the chart on the worksheet where your data
resides.
You’ll soon discover how you can change the chart location to its
own sheet. But just in case you don’t like your changes, make sure
to save your worksheet, which also saves your chart, before modi-
fying chart attributes.

Printing Workbooks
W
hen you finish compiling your worksheet, you’ll probably want to
print a hard copy or e-mail a copy to someone else. This chapter
shows you a number of Excel tools you can use to improve your document
layout, including headers, footers, page orientation, and margins.
Also, before you print or give your Excel file to someone else, you should
check it for spelling errors. You want to eliminate typos that scream to the
world, “I can’t spell.” Excel includes a built-in dictionary you can use to
check your workbooks for misspellings; however, it can’t read your mind. 
If you type too instead of two, Excel probably won’t indicate an error. But,
combine the spell check with careful proofreading, and it becomes a very
helpful tool.
When you are printing, Excel assumes you want to print the entire work-
sheet area unless you specify otherwise. You discover in this chapter how to
tell Excel exactly what you want to print. This chapter also includes these
topics:

Spell Check
1.
Choose Review➪Proofing➪Spelling. The Spelling dialog
box opens, and Excel highlights the cell where it finds
the first potential misspelling and also suggests possible
changes (as shown in Figure 12-1).
Spell Check reviews all cell values, comments, embedded charts,
text boxes, buttons, and headers and footers, but it does not check
protected worksheets, formulas, or text that results from a formula.
2.
Select one of the following options:
• Change or Change All: Choose one of the sugges-
tions; then click Change to change just this spelling
mistake or select Change All if you think you made
the mistake more than once.
• AutoCorrect: Have Excel, in future workbooks, auto-
matically correct the mistake with the selected
replacement. 
• Ignore Once: Click this button if you don’t want to
change the spelling of the highlighted instance.
• Ignore All: Click this button if you don’t want to
change the spelling of any identical instances.
• Add to Dictionary: Add a word, such as a proper
name or medical or legal term, to Excel’s built-in dic-
tionary so that Excel won’t flag it as a potential error
in the future.
3.
After you select an option, Excel proceeds to the next
error; when all potential mistakes are identified, Excel
asks you to click OK (as shown in Figure 12-2).

Working with
Outlines
W
hen you are working with a large worksheet, it is sometimes difficult
to look at the big picture your data presents to you. You can use Excel
to automatically calculate subtotal and grand total values from rows con-
taining related data (sometimes called a database). When you create subto-
tals, Excel outlines the list so that you can display or hide the detail rows for
each subtotal.
A couple of other database terms you should become familiar with are fields
and records. Fields break down your database list into manageable pieces by
using Excel columns. For example, an address database might include fields
such as name, address, and phone number. Records are the rows containing
the individual pieces of information you enter. In an address database, for
example, a single row contains all the information about a specific person.
Before you use the subtotal function, you must first sort your list so that 
the rows you want to subtotal are grouped together. You can then calculate
subtotals and perform other mathematical calculations for any columns that
contain numbers. You can also count the number of items in a selected
field.
If your data is not in a database format, you can still group sections to create
a quick way to display or hide them as necessary. Similarly to the way it does
subtotals, Excel displays groups in an outline format. In this chapter, I take a
look at the extensive subtotaling, grouping, and outlining features contained
in Excel. I also show you how to create a data entry form screen for faster
data entry. By default, Excel 2007 doesn’t include the Form command you
need for this, but I’ll show you how to add it to your Quick Access toolbar.

Select the rows or columns you want to remove from
the group. If you want to remove an entire group, select
all the rows or columns in the group.
2.
Choose Data➪Outline➪Ungroup. Excel removes the rows
or columns from the group and if the rows or columns
you delete are in the middle of a group, Excel breaks the

Filtering Data
A
fter you create an Excel database and assemble a large amount of data,
you probably want to analyze it. You may want to ask yourself ques-
tions about your data. “Who are my best customers?” “Which inventory
items are provided by a specific supplier and cost less than a certain
amount?” “Which employees work the least amount of hours?” Excel
includes several tools you can use to answer these questions and study your
data so you can make better decisions. 
Filtering means that Excel can pull out specific records for review. This pro-
vides you with an easy way to break down your data into smaller, more
manageable chunks. Filtering does not rearrange your data; it simply tem-
porarily hides records you don’t want to review so you can clearly examine
those you do.
You can create your filtered database just by typing in the Excel screen. You
can also use an Excel data entry screen, but it isn’t required.
This chapter is devoted to the different ways you can filter your data 
including
➟
Using AutoFilter, which allows you to select key pieces of data.
➟
Selecting records by using more than one condition. 
➟
Displaying only the top x number of records.
➟
Using multiple filtering to locate records that either match all criteria
or meet one or the other criteria.
➟

worksheet to manage your criteria selections.

match the text you specify. For example, if you look 
for records matching “Boston” only the records with
Boston appear. Records containing New Boston,
Boston Hill, Indianapolis, Bostonia, Atlanta, or
Chicago do not appear. If you chose Does Not Equal
you might see New Boston, Boston Hill, Indianapolis,
Bostonia, Atlanta, and Chicago, but not Boston.
• Begins With or Ends With: Locates all records in
which the selected field cells begin or end with the
text you specify. If you chose Begins With, Boston
Hill, Bostonia, and Boston display, but not New
Boston, Indianapolis, Atlanta, or Chicago. If you
chose Ends with, you would see the records for
Boston and New Boston but not Boston Hill,
Bostonia, Indianapolis, Atlanta, or Chicago.
• Contains or Does Not Contain: Locates all records
in which the selected field text contains or doesn’t

Creating PivotTables
M
any people don’t use PivotTables because they find them overwhelm-
ing. Yet, this powerful Excel tool enables you, in an instant, to see
your spreadsheet data in a variety of different ways. PivotTable reports allow
you to group information, along with varying levels of detail, by different
criteria such as date or category. These reports also automatically subtotal
the data on a separate worksheet, leaving your raw data untouched. 
Furthermore, PivotTable calculations aren’t limited to adding the numbers.
You can use Count, Average, Maximum, Minimum, and a number of other
statistical functions to help you view the overall picture of your data.
You can fill any of the four main PivotTable areas with data by a drag of the
mouse, and you can display the data in a table format or in one of Excel’s
many chart formats.
In this chapter, you find out how you can, within a matter of seconds, gener-
ate and extract meaningful information from a large amount of data,
thereby saving potentially dozens of hours of manual calculations.

Chapter

Create a PivotTable 
1.
Organize your data in a list, while keeping these points
in mind: 
• Each column should contain only one type of data;
for example, put dates in one column and values in
another. 
• Make sure each column in the list has a heading 
label directly above the data. (See Figure 15-1 for an
example.) PivotTables use the column headings as
PivotTable fields. 
• Do not leave any blank rows between the data and the
row headings and no blank columns within the data.
• Avoid blank cells within the data. If you have dupli-
cate data, use the Copy command to replicate it in
the blank cells.
• If you have more than one list on the same worksheet,
make sure at least one blank column and one blank
row separate them. Figure 15-2 illustrates a worksheet
with multiple data tables. Although you can create 
multiple PivotTables in a workbook, you can work with
only one table at a time when creating a PivotTable.
• Remove any Excel-generated subtotals or grand totals
in the data by choosing Data➪Outline➪Subtotal➪
Remove All. 
• Plan the questions that determine how you want your
data analyzed. For example, if your data is sales infor-
mation, perhaps you want to know your sales totals by
region or a specific salesperson, or even deeper such as
by both salesperson and by quarter. 
Figure 15-1: A PivotTable data example.

Chapter 15: Creating PivotTables

2.
Optionally, click any cell containing the data you want
to analyze. 
3.
Choose Insert➪Tables➪PivotTable. The Create
PivotTable dialog box appears. 
4.
Make a selection. Excel needs to know where your data
will come from:
• Microsoft Excel list or database: This choice creates
the PivotTable from organized data in a Microsoft
Excel worksheet. 
• External data source. This choice creates a PivotTable
from data stored in a non-Excel database. 
5.
Verify that Excel correctly identified your data range,
including the headings. If not, specify the correct area in
the Table/Range box as shown in Figure 15-3.
If the data is in another worksheet in the same workbook or a dif-
ferent saved workbook, type the workbook and worksheet name
like this: [workbookname]sheetname!range.
6.
Choose whether to add the PivotTable to a new work-
sheet in your workbook or to another existing work-
sheet. If you choose to add it to an existing worksheet,
you must specify a cell location.
7.
Click OK. Excel creates a new worksheet with a blank
PivotTable along with PivotTable Field List, which con-
tains each field from your data range (see Figure 15-4).
PivotTables contain three primary elements:
• Rows: The Rows area displays your data vertically,
with one item per row.
• Columns: The Columns area displays the data hori-
zontally, with one item per column.
• Values: Data Fields summarize numerical data.

Create a PivotTable

8.
From the PivotTable Field List pane, click the check box
next to the field you want categorized. For example, if
you want to determine how much each salesperson
sold, select the Rep ID field. Excel automatically places
each unique item into the Pivot Table rows and displays
the name in the Row Labels box in the Areas section
located beneath the field name list. In Figure 15-5, Excel
displays the name of each Sales Rep. 
If you want the categorized field displayed horizontally instead 
of vertically, drag the field to the Column Labels box of the Areas
section.
9.
From the PivotTable Field List pane, select the field,
such as Sales Amount, you want summarized and per-
form one of the following actions. Excel instantly takes
the data and adds the totals to create the summary
PivotTable (see Figure 15-6).
• Click the check box next to the field.
The PivotTable Field List indicates fields used in the PivotTable with
bold lettering. You don’t have to use all the fields in the PivotTable,
and you don’t have to place fields in every area of the PivotTable.
• Drag the field to the Values area in the Areas section. 
If you drag a field to an incorrect area, uncheck the field name
check box or drag the field name out of the Areas section onto the
Excel worksheet.
To delete a PivotTable, choose PivotTable Tools Options➪Actions➪
Select➪Entire PivotTable. Press the Delete key. Optionally, delete
the entire worksheet.
To move a PivotTable to a different location, choose PivotTable Tools
Options➪Move PivotTable. In the resulting dialog box, specify or

To create a second summary level, drag the next field
you want to subtotal from the PivotTable Field List onto
the desired PivotTable area, keeping these pointers in
mind:
• If you want to create a second category, such as by
Country and then by Salesman, drag the field into
the Row area. Figure 15-15 shows a PivotTable with
two categories. The field closest to the data is called
the inner row (in this example, Invoice Date). The
other field is called an outer row (in this example,
Salesperson). Excel displays data in the inner row
under each of the outer row fields.
• If you want to change the order of the inner and
outer row fields, from the Area box, drag the field
you want as the outer row to the top of the box. 
• If you want to total additional fields, drag the field
into the Data area.
You can add even more data fields to your PivotTable. PivotTable
data fields are only limited by the amount of memory in your 
computer.

Building Simple
Macros
You can often save yourself time by automating tasks you perform fre-
quently. The automation takes the form of an Excel Macro, which is a
series of commands and functions grouped together as a single command.
Macros are created in a special programming language called Visual Basic
and can be run whenever you need to perform the task. 
Although you can write your own very complex macros in the Visual Basic
programming language, the easiest method for creating many macros is to
use the Excel Macro Recorder. When you record a macro, Excel stores infor-
mation about each step you take as you perform a series of commands. You
then run the macro to repeat, or play back, the commands.
The macro recorder is very literal and records every action you complete.
Therefore, planning your macro before you begin the recording process is
very important so you don’t record unnecessary steps. 
Security is an important issue when working with macros. If you open work-
sheets containing macros from outside sources, these macros can be harmful
to your computer. By default, Excel protects you from running macros, but if
you’re creating your own macros, you’ll probably change these protective
security settings.
In this chapter, you find out how to change your security settings, as well as
how to record, run, and delete Excel macros.

Check Macro Security Level 
1.
Choose Developer➪Code➪Macro Security. The Trust
Center dialog box shown in Figure 16-7 appears. 
2.
Set a security level:
• Disable all macros without notification: Allows you
to run only macros that are stored in a trusted loca-
tion. Click the Trusted Location section to manage
these trusted locations. (See Figure 16-8). Also, since
the macros are automatically disabled, this option
disables security alerts.
• Disable all macros with notification: Displays a
security alert when a workbook with macros opens.
You can then decide whether to enable the macros
associated with the workbook. This is the Excel
default setting.
• Disable all macros except digitally signed macros:
You can only run only those macros that are digitally
signed. 
A digital signature is an electronic, encrypted, secure stamp of
authentication obtained from a commercial certification authority.
Excel’s Visual Basic programming language contains a self-certify-
ing digital signature tool, but because it doesn’t come from a third
party, Excel still considers it unauthenticated and displays a warn-
ing box before running self-certified macros.
• Enable all macros: Allows macros to run without a
notification. This can be helpful if you run a lot of
macros, but be aware of the risk when using macros
from unknown sources.

Split Data into Multiple Columns
1.
If necessary, insert blank columns to the left of the cells you
want to convert into multiple columns. If you want your
data in three columns, you must have two blank columns. 
2.
Select the cells you want to convert.
You can’t split empty cells, and you can’t split merged cells. You must
first unmerge the cells. See Chapter 5 for information about merged
cells.
3.
Choose Data➪Data Tools➪Text to Columns. The Convert
Text to Columns Wizard appears.
4.
Select the Original Data type that best suits your existing
data. For example, if you’re separating text that is variable
in length such as a first name and last name, select
Delimited. The Delimited data type works best if your data
has a similar format. If all cells contain a specific number
of characters, choose Fixed Width. See Figure 17-7. 
If your data type is delimited, be sure each section is separated by a
common character such as a comma, period, apostrophe, or tab.
5.
Click Next. The option you see next depends on which
data type you selected in Step 4.
6.
If you selected Fixed Width, click the ruler bar where you
want the data to split. If you selected Delimited, enter the
character you use to separate your text. In Figure 17-8, the
text is separated by a comma.
7.
Click Finish. Excel separates the selected cells into multi-
ple columns.
8.
Click OK.
To split data into two lines in the same cell, press Alt + Enter at the
point where you want to break the line.

Merge Columns
1.
Click in the cell where you want to put the merged data.
2.
Choose Formulas➪Function Library➪Insert Function.
3.
From the Or Select A Category drop-down list, choose
Text.
4.
Select Concatenate. (See Figure 17-9.)
5.
Click OK. The Function Arguments dialog box appears.
6.
Type the first cell address or click the cell you want to
add to the combination. Excel enters the cell address in
the Text1 box.
Optionally, if you want to add specific text that’s not in a cell
address, type the text or punctuation (including any spaces) on any
line. Excel places any spaces, punctuation, or text in quotation
marks.
7.
In the Text2 box, click the cell or type the text you want
next. Each element must go on its own Text-box line.
Figure 17-10 shows an example.
8.
Click OK.
To convert the merged cells into plain text, instead of formulas,
select the merged cells, choose Edit➪Copy; next, choose
Edit➪Paste Special; and finally, select Values from the Paste Special
dialog box.
Optionally, use the ampersand (&) between cell addresses to join
text items. For example, =A1&B1 returns the same value as =CON-
CATENATE(A1,B1). However, the cells you connect with the amper-
sand cannot be blank.
You can also use the CONCATENATE command along with a couple of
other functions, to display only certain digits — for example, the last
four digits of cell containing a credit card number. If cell C5 contains the
credit card number, and you want cell D5 to display ****-****-1234,
enter the following formula in cell D5. =CONCATENATE(REPT(“****-”,3),
RIGHT(C5,4)). The REPT function repeats the “****-” text three times
and combines that with the last four digits of the credit card number,
which are derived from the RIGHT function.

Collaborating 
in Excel 
C
hances are, you have an Excel workbook that others need to access. You
may copy the workbook to another disk and hand it to your coworkers,
the others may access it directly from your computer, or you may even e-mail
or post the file on the Internet. Excel provides several features aimed at help-
ing people collaborate on a workbook. All users can add their own comments,
track revisions as multiple people edit the workbook, and merge multiple
copies of the workbook. 
Comments are notes that you attach to cells, separate from other cell con-
tent. Using comments allows you or others reviewing a workbook to provide
instruction, for example, noting how a complex formula works, entering
thoughts, questions, and even specifications about the type of information
you want the end user to enter into the cells. Adding a comment does not
change the overall appearance of the worksheet. You can think of comments
as sticky notes for an individual worksheet’s cells.
When multiple people edit a workbook it can be difficult to determine
which person made which changes. Revision tracking helps you determine
who added changes to the file and what the changes were — including
formatting changes and data additions or deletions. The tracking feature
changes the color for each person’s edits, making it easy to see who changed
what in the workbook. When you review the workbook, you can choose to
accept or reject the changes.

Integrating Excel
into Word
N
o single computer program does everything, and in reality, you don’t
want it to. You probably use multiple applications for different tasks
such as playing solitaire, surfing the Internet, reading e-mail, and of course,
working with Excel. If you use Excel, you probably use Microsoft Word to
create memos, letters, and other such documents.
In this chapter, I show you how to integrate two major Microsoft Office
applications: Word and Excel. You discover how you can create a worksheet
in Excel and include it in the middle of a Word document.
If you create a table in Word and then conclude that you are better off work-
ing in Excel, you can copy the Word table into any Excel worksheet. You
don’t need to start completely over.
Take a look and see how easily these two powerful applications work
together!

Blending Excel and
PowerPoint
O
ne of the most common ways to make others aware of your work is
by giving a presentation. The Microsoft Office product PowerPoint is
one of the most effective presentation products available in today’s market.
And since PowerPoint is part of the Microsoft Office suite, it’s very easy to
integrate information from other Office applications (in this example, Excel)
into a PowerPoint presentation. 
My mother always told me to do things right the first time. If you already
spent the time and energy to create information in Excel, why should you
have to re-create it in your PowerPoint presentation?
That’s what this chapter is about. You learn how to take the powerful
worksheet data or creative chart that you created in Excel and copy it
to a PowerPoint slide. You can simply copy it once from Excel to
PowerPoint, or you can create a link so that if the data in Excel changes,
your PowerPoint presentation automatically reflects the changes. That’s
doing it right the first time . . .

Using Excel
with Access
You can share data between Access and Excel in many ways. You can
copy data from an open worksheet and paste it into an Access
datasheet, import a worksheet into an Access database, or simply load an
Access datasheet into Excel using the Analyze It with Excel command. 
This chapter shows you how you exchange data between Access and Excel
through one of several processes:
➟
Importing, which creates a copy of an Excel spreadsheet in Access
format.
➟
Linking, which connects an Access table to an Excel worksheet so that
you can view and edit the data in both the original program and in
the Access file. Linking is useful when Excel data must be shared
between Excel and Access users.
➟
Exporting, which allows you analyze your Access data in Excel format. 
Entire books are written about using Access, so this chapter assumes you
already know about general database terms, such as records, fields, tables,
queries, and primary keys. I also assume you know the basics of creating and
using an Access database.

Import Data from Excel
to an Access Table
1.
Prepare your Excel worksheet data before importing into
Access:
• If you don’t want to import the entire worksheet, cre-
ate a named range in the Excel workbook that contains
the cells you want to import. (See Chapter 2.)
• Make sure the cells are in tabular format. If the work-
sheet contains merged cells, the contents of the cell
are placed in the field that corresponds to the left-
most column, and the other fields are left blank. 
• If the Excel spreadsheet has a cell containing more
255 characters, Access truncates the data to 255
characters. 
2.
If you don’t already have an Access database created,
from the Access Getting Started screen, click Blank
Database. If you already have an Access database, open
the database and skip Step 3. 
3.
Enter a name and click Create. (See Figure 21-1.)
4.
Choose External Data➪Import➪Excel. The Get External
Data — Excel Spreadsheet dialog box appears.
5.
Click the Browse button to locate and select the Excel
file from which you want to import data. The file name
appears in the File Name text box. (See Figure 21-2.)
6.
Specify if you want the data in an existing table or a
new table. If you want it in an existing table, you select
the table name.
Figure 21-1: Create a new database for importing Excel data.
Figure 21-2: Select the Excel file you want to import.
If you select an existing table, Access appends the data to the table. Make
the sure the number of columns in the worksheet or named range matches
the number of fields in the table. The name, date type, and position of each
column must also match those of the corresponding field in the Access table.
➟

Chapter 21: Using Excel with Access

7.
Click OK. The Import Spreadsheet Wizard appears.
8.
Select the worksheet you want to import or a specific
named range. (See Figure 21-3.) If the workbook has no
named ranges and only one worksheet, you do not see
this screen. 
9.
Click Next.
10.
Specify if the first row of your worksheet contains col-
umn headings. Access creates field names from the col-
umn headings. 
11.
Click Next.
12.
Assign field names to each column by clicking the
desired column and typing a name in the Field Name
text box. (See Figure 21-4.)
If a column name violates the field naming rules in Access, Access
assigns a valid name to the field. 
13.
Assign field types to each column.
14.
Choose Yes or No if you want the field indexed. 
Optionally, click on a column you don’t want to include and click the
Do Not Import Field (Skip) option. You can skip columns during the
import, but you can’t skip rows. 
15.
Click Next.
16.
Select an option regarding the primary index key. You
can let Access create one for you, select your own pri-
mary key, or choose not have a primary key.
17.
Click Next.
18.
If you are creating a new table, enter a name.
19.
Click Finish. Access imports the data and prompts you
to save the import settings for future imports.
You can import only one worksheet or named range at a time during
an import operation. 
If any errors incur during the import, Access creates an error log table
in the database and displays the name of the table in a message. It’s a
good idea to open the error log table and review the errors.

Import Data from Excel to an Access Table

20.
Click the Close button. A new table appears in Access,
as you see in Figure 21-5.
To import multiple worksheets or named ranges, repeat the
import process for each worksheet or range.
21.
Double-click the Access table and review the imported
data. (See Figure 21-6.) Keep in mind the following facts
about imported data:
• Imported data: Importing a worksheet into Access
creates a duplicate copy of the data and does not
make any changes to the source Excel file. 
• Graphical elements: Access does not import graphi-
cal elements, such as logos, charts, and pictures. 
• Data type: Access determines the data type based
on the first 25 rows of data. If any values beyond
the 25th row are not compatible with the chosen
data type, Access ignores those values and does not
import them. 
• Calculated values: Access imports only the results of
a calculated cell, not the formula itself. For example,
if cell D13 contains the formula B13*C13, which
results in a value of 100, only the value of 100 goes
into Access, not the B13*C13. To update the formu-
las, you can link the Excel worksheet to Access. See
the next section.
• Hyperlinks: Access imports cells containing hyper-
links as text fields.

11.
Double-click the Access table which, as you see in Figure
21-9, appears as an Excel icon with an arrow next to it,
indicating that the table is an Excel link. Keep the follow-
ing in mind when reviewing the data in Access:
• When you create a link, Access creates a new table but
the data is actually stored in the source worksheet, not
in the database table. Any changes you make to the data
in the Access table updates the source Excel file. Any
change you make in the Excel file, Access automatically
reflects in the linked Access table.
• Graphics, such as logos, charts, or pictures stored in the
Excel worksheet, are not visible in Access. 
• You cannot change the field data type or size.
• The source cells that contain formulas display only as
results in Access, and you cannot modify the values in
Access.
• Access stores Excel cells longer than 255 characters in a
memo field that displays only the first 255 characters.

Designing an
Organization 
Chart
Your office is changing rapidly. The staff appears to grow by leaps and
bounds, and you see quite a few new faces around. When that happens,
it’s often difficult to remember who’s who and their job titles. 
You’ve been assigned the task of creating an organization chart to illustrate
the reporting relationships in your company. Creating quality organization
charts can be challenging, especially if you’re not a professional designer.
You’ll be happy to learn that Excel 2007 includes more than 120 different
SmartArt graphics, each with its own purpose, including some for creating
hierarchy graphics such as an organization chart. In general, SmartArt graph-
ics provide visual information you can use to quickly and easily communi-
cate a message. 
SmartArt graphics are most effective when the number of shapes and the
amount of text are limited. Larger amounts of text can distract from the
visual appeal of your SmartArt graphic and make it harder to convey your
message visually. 
This chapter takes you through the steps of creating a designer-quality
organization chart using the Excel SmartArt graphic function. Go ahead . . .

Creating a Commission
Calculator
S
uppose you’re a business owner, and you pay your salespeople a sliding
commission rate based on their total sales for a specified period, such as
a month. First, you need a sheet of paper to list each salesperson’s sales.
Then, at the end of the period, you have to subtotal each person’s sales.
Finally, you have to figure out which commission percentage to give each
person based on that subtotal. 
A Commission Calculator worksheet, designed using basic Excel features,
along with several Excel functions (SUMIF, COUNTIF, and nested IF state-
ments) can do everything for you except enter the individual sales. Excel
saves you precious time and reduces the chance for human error. To set up a
worksheet, you perform the following tasks:
➟
Enter basic headings.
➟
Create a sliding commission rate table.
➟
Define the data input area where you track the individual sales.
➟
Design the calculation area where Excel calculates the totals and
commission.
➟
Enhance the worksheet appearance so it’s easier to read.
➟
Protect and save the worksheet as a template.

1.
At the bottom of the worksheet where you will enter the
individual sales, select the cells in the Salesperson col-
umn. In Figure 23-3, I selected cells C15 through C114,
which gives room for 100 sales entries.

Total Sales with the SUMIF Function

Use the COUNTIF Function
to Count Sales
1.
In cell B4, enter the formula =COUNTIF(SalesRep,A4)
and then press the Enter key. If you entered sample data
in the sales data input area, you see the total number of
sales for the salesperson.
2.
Select cell B4 and choose Home➪Clipboard➪Copy. A
marquee appears around cell B4.
3.
Highlight cells B5 through the end of your salesperson
list. 
4.

Calculate Commission with
a Nested IF Statement
1.
In cell D4, enter the beginning function and the first
parameter to check the total sales for the salesperson
against the commission table. Type =IF(C4<$K$5 and a
comma.
2.
Enter the first True result. Type C4*$L$4 and a comma.
3.
Enter the first False result that begins another IF state-
ment. Type IF(C4<$K$6 and a comma (see Figure 23-6).
Be sure to place the dollar signs in front of the cell references to
make them an absolute reference to a specific cell.

4.
Enter the next True result. Type C4*$L$5 and a comma.
5.
Enter the next False result that again begins another IF
statement. Type IF(C4<$K$7 and a comma.
6.
Enter the third True result, if applicable. Type C4*$L$6
and a comma.
7.
Enter the third False result, which in my example is the
last level to check. Type C4*$L$7.
8.
Type three closing parentheses, enough to match
the number of opening parentheses and press Enter.
Figure 23-7 illustrates the final formula and its results.
9.
Copy the formula to the other rows.
The Excel IF function evaluates a condition you specify and returns
one value if the statement is TRUE and another value if it evalu-
ates to FALSE. In this example, if the sales are less than the first
commission level, making the first condition TRUE, it calculates
the sales multiplied by the first-level commission percentage. If the
statement is not TRUE, then Excel checks if the sales are less than
a second commission level, and if so, it multiplies the sales times that
commission level percentage. The nesting continues until Excel
checks all commission levels, resulting in a commission amount.
Create Totals
1.
In cell B11, or the cell below your last sales rep, create a
SUM function to total the cells above it. In Figure 23-8,
the formula =SUM(B4:B10) totals the sales orders.
2.
Select the formula in cell B11. Choose
Home➪Clipboard➪Copy, or press Ctrl + C.
3.
Select the cells C11 and D11 and choose Home➪

Tracking Medical
Expenses
W
ith today’s high cost of medical care, very few of us can be
without medical insurance. In fact, many of us have two insur-
ance companies — perhaps Medicare and a supplemental insurance, or
insurance through your employer and your spouse’s employer.
Tracking medical costs is very important, especially when filing your annual
tax return. In this project, you create an Excel spreadsheet that efficiently
tracks your expenses, generating totals and even sorting out prescriptions
from the rest of the medical-expense totals. See at a glance the total of your
medical expenses, how much is paid by your insurance companies, and —
most important — how much you have to pay out-of-pocket.
To accomplish this task, you use a number of Excel features, including data
validation, duplication of worksheets, creating totals from other worksheets,
and a few Excel mathematical functions.
I hope your health is good, and you won’t need to use this worksheet a lot!
But if you must . . . you’ll be glad it’s here.

Planning for Your
Financial Future
Your life is taking shape right in front of you. You and your spouse want
to buy a house, raise a family, and enjoy life happily ever after. Your
personal future depends a lot on your financial future. Fortunately, Excel
has several functions you can use to plan for the future you want. 
First, to maintain realistic expectations, you need to determine how much
house you can afford to buy. But before you can buy the dream house, you
know you must pay off some credit card debt. Also, from your own experi-
ence, you know that college is expensive, and the costs are bound to get
much higher by the time the kids are ready. Finally come your golden years.
You dream of the house on the beach or traveling to exotic places.
How are you ever going to save enough for that? This chapter shows you
how to: 
➟
Determine how much payments will run on that cute little ranch
house down the street. Excel has a PMT function to help with that.
➟
Plan to pay off a credit card balance using the NPER function, which
requires three key pieces of information: the interest rate, the current
payment amount, and the credit card balance.
➟
Determine how much you need to save each month to reach a college-
fund or retirement goal. Again, utilize Excel’s PMT function.

Plan to Purchase a House
1.
In cell A1, type OUR DREAM HOUSE.
2.
In cells A3 through A8, type House Price, Down
Payment, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Term, and
Monthly Payment.
3.
In cell B3, enter the house price.
4.
In cell B4, enter the down payment amount you plan
on making.
5.
In cell B5, enter the formula =B3-B4. This gives the
amount you will finance.
6.
In cell B6, enter the interest rate. Enter and format this
amount as a percentage.
7.
In cell B7, enter the loan term. Usually for a house, this
value is in years. (See Figure 25-1.)
8.
In cell B8, enter a PMT function to calculate the
monthly payment. The PMT function has three required
arguments (=PMT(RATE, NETPER, PV), so you enter
=PMT(B6/12,B7*12,B5). (See Figure 25-2.)
• RATE, which is the annual interest rate. You entered
the Interest Rate in cell B6. To get a monthly rate, you
divide this argument by 12.
• NETPER is the term of the loan, which you entered in
cell B7. Because this value is in years and you want
monthly payments, you multiply this argument by 12.
• PV represents the present value, which is the amount
you will finance, not including interest. You calcu-
lated this amount in cell B5.
9.
Apply any desired formatting to the cells.

Prepare To Pay Off a Credit Card
Balance
1.
In cell D1, type PAY OFF CREDIT CARD.
2.
In cells D3, D4 and D5, type Monthly percentage rate,
Current payments, Credit card balance, and Months
until paid off, respectively.
3.
In cell E3, create a formula to enter the monthly percentage
rate you are paying on a credit card. For example, if you
are paying a 21% annual interest, you enter =21%/12, or
the 21% annual rate divided by 12 months, which dis-
plays a value of .0175 (1.75%). (See Figure 25-3.) 
For ease in understanding the cell contents, format the cells using
the following steps as you enter the data.
4.
In cell E4, enter your current payment amount preceded
by a minus sign. Enter –150 if you are making $150
payments every month against the credit card balance.
5.
In cell E5, enter the remaining balance on the credit
card. Like the payments, this must be entered as a nega-
tive value such as –3700.
6.
Create a NPER formula to calculate how many months
it will take to pay off the credit card. The formula
should read =NPER(E3,E4,E5). As you see in Figure
25-4, the resulting answer shows how many months it
will take to pay off the credit card balance. The NPER
function has three required arguments: 
• Interest rate, which is usually given annually. You
divide it by 12 to obtain a monthly rate. 
• Payment amount, which you enter as a negative
amount. 
• Present value, which is the amount of the loan not
including interest.
See how much earlier you can pay the credit card off by entering a
higher payment amount in cell B4.
Figure 25-3: Enter the annual interest rate divided by 12.

Save for College or Retirement
1.
In cell A12, type OUR SAVINGS GOALS.
2.
In cell A14, type Savings Goal Amount.
3.
In cell A15, type Interest Rate.
4.
In cell A16, type Years to Goal.
5.
In cell A17, type Current Savings.
6.
In cell A18, type Monthly Amount to Save. (See
Figure 25-5.)
7.
In cell B14, enter the savings goal amount. 
8.
In cell B15, enter the annual interest rate.
9.
In cell B16, enter the number of years you have until
you need the money for college or retirement.
10.
In cell B17, enter the amount you already have saved
toward the goal.
11.
In cell B18, create a PMT formula that includes the
interest rate, term, and amount. You also need to add
one of the optional arguments; the future value argu-
ment. This time, the PMT formula format is =PMT(inter-
est rate, term, current value, future value) so you should
enter =PMT(B15/12, B16*12,B17,B14). The PMT func-
tion actually has two optional arguments which are
• Future Value, which is the balance of the loan after all
payments have been made. You do not need to enter a
future value unless the value at the end is not equal to
zero. In this example, the end goal is your savings goal. 
• Payment Type one or zero, which indicates whether
the payment occurs at the beginning of the month
(1) or the end of the month (0). 
12.
Format the cells as desired. Figure 25-6 displays an
example.
