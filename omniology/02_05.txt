Question Explanation
Correct answer is 
. Questions 1 and 2 show that the two logical operators 
 and 
 are sufficient to express every logical sentence in propositional logic. In fact, the 
 operator
along with any one of the operators 
, 
, 
 is sufficient.
Question 3
Consider a binary new logical operator  called NAND or Sheffer stroke. It can be defined by the
following truth table.

Question Explanation
The correct answer is 
. Questions 4 and 5 show that the  operator is
sufficient to express any propositional logic sentence written using only 
 and 
. Along with the
earlier conclusion 
 and 
 are sufficient to express all of propositional logic, we can conclude
that the  operator alone is sufficient to express all of propositional logic. In fact, many computer
circuits are built using only the NAND gate.
