Preface 
The 34th Workshop of The International School of Mathematics G. Stampac- 
chia, The International Workshop on Optimization and Control with Applica- 
tions, was held during July 9-17, 2001 in Ettore Majorana Centre for Scientific 
Culture, Erice, Sicily, Italy. The Workshop was supported by Italian Ministry 
of University and Scientific Research, Sicilian Regional Government, The Hong 
Kong Polytechnic University and The National Cheng Kung University. The 
Director of The International School of Mathematics G. Stampacchia is Franco 
Giannessi. The Directors of the Workshop are Liqun Qi and Kok Lay Teo. 
They jointly organized the Workshop. About 90 scholars from as many as 26 
countries and regions attended the Workshop. It consisted of 21 45-minute 
invited lectures, 45 30-minute contributed talks and 11 15-minute short com- 
munications. 
This book contains 28 papers emitted from the Workshop. All papers were 
refereed. A special issue of Journal of Global Optimization containing 6 papers 
from the Workshop is also published. 
The 28 papers are divided into four parts: Part I, Duality and Optimality 
Conditions, has 6 papers, Part 11, Optimization Algorithms, has 9 papers, 
Part 111, Optimal Control, has 8 papers, Part IV, Variational Inequality and 
Equilibrium Problems, has five papers. 
One of the invited lecturers of the Workshop was Professor Elijah (Lucien) 
Polak, who is a legend in our community. As a survivor of the Holocaust, Lucien 
has made many significant contributions to optimization and control and their 
applications. Lucien was close to his 70th birthday during the Workshop. We 
decided to dedicate this edited volume to him. 
We wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Professor Franco 
Giannessi, the staff of Ettore Majorana Centre for Scientific Culture, and all 
speakers and participants for their contribution to the success of the Work- 
shop. We would also like to thank Eva Yiu for the clerical work she provided 
for the workshop. We greatly appreciate the support from the referees of all 
submissions to this Special Issue for their reviews.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
We are very happy to see that this Workshop has become a new confer- 
ence series. This Workshop is now regarded as OCA 2001. During August 
18-22, 2002, The Second International Conference on Optimization and Con- 
trol with Applications (OCA2002) was successfully held in Tunxi, China. The 
Third International Conference on Optimization and Control with Applications 
(OCA2003) will be held in Chongqing-Chengdu, China, during July 1-7, 2003. 
Liqun Qi and Kok Lay Teo have continued to be the Directors of OCA 2002 
and OCA 2003. We hope that OCA Series will continue to provide a forum 
for international researchers and practitioners working in optimization, optimal 
control and their applications to exchange information and ideas on the latest 
development in these fields.

Biographical Sketch of Elijah Polak 
Professor Elijah Polak 
Elijah (Lucien) Polak was born August 11, 1931 in Bialystok, Poland. He is 
a holocaust surviver and a veteran of the death camps at Dachau, Auschwitz, 
Gros Rosen, and Buchenwald. His father perished in the camps, but his mother 
survived. After the War, he worked as an apprentice blacksmith in Poland and 
a clothes salesman in France. In 1949, he and his mother migrated to Australia, 
where, after an eight year interruption, he resumed his education, while working 
various part time jobs. 
Elijah Polak received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, from the 
University of Melbourne, .Australia, in 1957 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees,

both in Electrical Engineering, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 
1959 and 1961, respectively. 
In 1961 he married Ginette with whom he had a son and a daughter. At 
present, they have 5 grandchildren, of which two are beginning to show an 
interest in mathematics. 
From 1957 to 1958 he was employed as an Instrument Engineer by Imperial 
Chemical Industries, Australia and New Zealand, Ltd., in Melbourne, Aus- 
tralia. He spent the summers of 1959 and 1960 as a Summer Student, with 
I.B.M. Research Laboratories, San Jose, California, and the Fall Semester of 
1964 as a Visiting Assistant Professor, at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology. Since 1961, he has been on the faculty of the University of California, 
Berkeley, where he is at present Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Sciences, as well as Professor in the Graduate School. 
He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1968 - 1969, at the Institut Blaise Pascal, 
in Paris, France, and a United Kingdom Science Research Council Senior Post 
Doctoral Fellow, at Imperial College, London, England, in 1972, in 1976, in 
1979, in 1982, 1985, 1988, and in 1990. 
His research interests lie in the development of optimization algorithms for 
computer-aided design, with applications to electronic circuit design, control 
system design, and structural design, as well as algorithms for optimal control 
and nonsmooth optimization. 
He is the author or co-author of over 250 papers as well as of four books: 
Theory of Mathematical Programming and Optimal Control (with M. Canon 
and C. Cullum, 1970), Notes of a First Course on Linear Systems (with E. 
Wong, 1970), Computational Methods in Optimization (1971), and Optimiza- 
tion: Algorithms and Consistent Approximations (1997). In addition, with L. 
A. Zadeh, he co-edited System Theory (1969), and translated from the Russian 
Absolute Stability of Regulator Systems, by M. A. Aizerman and F. R. Gant- 
macher . 
He is a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, a 
member of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics and a member 
of the Mathematical Programming Society. 
He is an Associate Editor the Journal of Optimization Theory and Applica- 
tions, and of the Journal of Computational Optimization and Applications.

Abstract: 
In this paper different classes of unconstrained and constrained 
minimization problems with max-min objective and/or constraint functions are 
studied. First we consider simple problems with the max-min objective function, 
where the explicit description of all local minimizers is given. Then we discuss 
the application of the cutting angle and discrete gradient methods as well as a 
special penalization method for solving constrained problems. We report the 
results of preliminary numerical experiments. 
Key words: Max-min function, cutting angle method, discrete gradient method, 
quasidifferential.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Max-min functions form one of the interesting and important for applications 
classes of nonconvex and nonsmooth functions. There are many practical tasks 
where the objective function and/or constraints belong to this class. For exam- 
ple, optimization problems with max-min constraints arise in different branches 
of engineering such as the design of electronic circuits subject to a toleranc- 
ing and tuning provision (see Bandler, et a1 (1976); Liu et a1 (1992); Muller 
(1976); Polak and Sangiovanni Vincentelli (1979); Polak (1981)), the design 
of paths for robots in the presence of obstacles (Gilbert and Johnson (1985)), 
the design of heat exchangers (Grossman and Sargent (1978); Halemane and 
Grossman (1983); Ostrovsky et a1 (1994)) and chemical reactors (Halemane 
and Grossman (1983); Ostrovsky et a1 (1994)), in the layout design of VLSI 
circuits (Cheng et a1 (1992); Hochbaum (1993)) etc. Optimization problems 
with max-min objective and constraint functions also arise when one tries to 
design systems under uncertainty (see Bracken and McGill (1974); Grossman 
and Sargent (1978); Halemane and Grossman (1983); Ierapetritou and Pis- 
tikopoulos (1994); Ostrovsky et a1 (1994)). 
A mathematical formalization of one of the main problems of cluster analysis 
leads to the following optimization problem: for a given set of points ai E 
lRn, i = 1, . . . , m find a collection it = {it1, . . . ,itP} of p n-dimensional vectors, 
which is a solution of the following problem: 
minimize f (xl,. . . , xp) = max 
min Ilxl-sill subject toxl E D, I = 1,. . . , p  
i=l, ..., m l=l, ..., p 
where D c lRn is a compact set. 
It is known that piecewise linear functions can be represented as max-min 
of certain linear functions (see Bartels et a1 (1995)). Thus the minimization 
of piecewise linear functions can be reduced to the minimization of functions 
represented as max-min of linear functions. 
In the theory of abstract convexity an arbitrary Lipschitz continuous func- 
tion on the unit simplex is underestimated by certain max-min functions (see 
Rubinov (2000) for details). Thus, the global minimization of Lipschitz func- 
tions can be reduced to the sequence of global minimization problems with 
special max-min objective functions (see Bagirov and Rubinov (2000); Rubi- 
nov (2000)). 

ON MINIMIZATION O F  MAX-MIN FUNCTIONS

In the paper (Kirjner-Neto and Polak (1998)), the authors consider opti- 
mization problems with twice continuously differentiable objective functions 
and max-min constraint functions. They convert this problem to a certain 
problem of smooth optimization. 
In this paper we consider different classes of unconstrained and constrained 
minimization problems with max-min objective and/or constraint functions. 
The paper consists of four parts. First, we investigate a special simple class of 
max-min functions. We give a explicit description of all local minima and show 
that even in such a simple case the number of local minimizers is very large. 
We discuss the applicability of the discrete gradient method (see, for example 
Bagirov (1999a); Bagirov (199913)) for finding a local minimizer of discrete max- 
min functions without constraints in the second part. 
The constrained minimization problems with max-min constraints are ex- 
amined in the third part. We use a special penalization approach (see Rubinov 
et a1 (2002)) for this purpose. 
The unconstrained global minimization of some continuous maximum func- 
tions by the cutting angle method (see, for example, Rubinov (2000)) are stud- 
ied in the fourth part. If the number of internal variables in the continuous 
maximum functions is large enough (more than 5) then the minimization prob- 
lem of these functions cannot be solved by using traditional discretization. 
Application of the cutting angle method allows us to solve such problems with 
small number of external and large enough number of internal variables (up to 
15 internal variables). 
We provide results of numerical experiments, which allow us to conclude 
that even for simple max-min functions the number of local minima can be 
very large. It means that the problem of minimization of such functions is 
quite complicated. However, results of numerical experiments show that meth- 
ods considered in this paper allow us to solve different kinds of problems of 
minimization of max-min functions up to 10 variables. 
The paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2- we study the problem of 
minimization of special max-min functions over the unit simplex. Section 3 
is devoted to the problem of minimization of the discrete max-min functions. 
Minimization problems with max-min constraints are studied in Section 4. The 
problem of global minimization of the continuous maximum functions is dis- 
cussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

SPECIAL CLASSES OF MAX-MIN OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS 
In this section we propose an algorithm for solving special classes of minimiza- 
tion problems with the max-min objective functions. This algorithm allow us 
to calculate the set of all local minimizers. 
2.1 ICAR and IPH functions 
Let I = ( 1 , .  . . , n} and Rn be an n-dimensional vector space. For each x E Rn 
we denote by xi the i-th coordinate of the vector x. We use the following 
notation: 
Let R; = { x  E Rn : x > 0 )  be the cone of vectors with nonnegative coordi- 
nates. For a vector 1 E Ry consider the sets 
If 1 > 0 then I(1) = 0 if and only if 1 = 0. We also have I(1) U Io(l) = I. For 
each 1 E R"+ \{O) consider the function, which we denote by the same symbol 
1: 
l ( x )  = min Lixi, 
x E Ry . 
iEI(1) 
(2.1) 
A function of the form (2.1) is called the min-type function generated by 1 (or 
simply a min-type function). 
Let f be a function defined on R:. 
A function f is called increasing if 
x > y implies that f ( x )  > f (y). The restriction of the function f to a ray 
R, = { a y  : a > 0 )  starting from zero and passing through y is the function of 
one variable 
f Y ( Q )  = f (QY). 
(2.2) 
Definition 2.1 A function f : R"+ + IR is called ICAR (increasing convex- 
along-rays) function if f is increasing and the restriction o f f  to each ray Ry, 
y E IR,; \{O) is a convex function. 
The class of ICAR functions is very broad. It contains all increasing convex 
functions and all polynomials with nonnegative coefficients and also some con- 
cave functions. 

ON MINIMIZATION O F  MAX-MIN FUNCTIONS 
7 
Let L be the set of all min-type functions. A function 1 E L is called an 
L-subgradient of f at a point y E R? if l(x) - l(y) I. f ( x )  - f (y) for all x. The 
corresponding vector 1 is called a support vector for f at y. The set d~ f ( y )  of 
all subgradients off at y is called the L-subdifferential of f at y. If 1 E d~ f ( y )  
then the function i ( x )  = l(x) - l(y) + f ( y )  enjoys the following properties: 
i ( x )  5 f ( x )  for all x E Rn+ and i(y) 
= f(y). Let x E R + , x  # 0 and u 2 0 .  
We shall use the following notation: 
The following result holds: 
Theorem 2.1 (see Rubinov (2000)) Let f be a finite ICAR function defined 
on lR"+ Then for each y E R+ \{0} the L subdifferential d~ f ( y )  is not empty 
and contains all vectors of the form u l x  where u E d f y ( l )  and df,(l) is the 
subdifferential (in the sense of convex analysis) of the convex function fy defined 
by (2.2)) at the point a = 1. In particular, if f is strictly increasing at the point 
y (x 5 y, x # y implies f ( x )  < f ( y ) )  and differentiable at this point, then 
where (., .) is a usual inner product. 
The following result is based on Theorem 2.1. (See Rubinov (2000) for details.) 
Proposition 2.1 Let f be an ICAR function and let X c int IR? be a compa,ct 
set. Then for each E > 0 there exists a finite set { x l , .  . . , x j )  c X )  su,ch th.at 
the function 
h ( x )  = max min (lFxi - ck), 
k l j  i ~ I ( 1 k )  
(2.4) 
where lk is an arbitrary element of dL f ( x k )  and ck = f ( x k )  - f'(xk, x"), k = 
1,. . . , j, curries out a unzform lower approximation o f f ,  that is, 
It is easy to see that the function h is ICAR (see Rubinov (2000)). 
An important subclass of the set of all ICAR functions consists of increasing 
positively homogeneous of degree one(1PH) functions. Recall that a function f 

8 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
defined on RT is called positively homogeneous of degree one if 
The function f is IPH if and only iff is positively homogeneous ICAR function. 
It follows from (2.5) that an ICAR function is IPH if the function f, defined 
by (2.2) is linear for all y E R;, y # 0. 
The following result holds (see Rubinov (2000)). 
Theorem 2.2 
1) A finite function defined on IR? is IPH if and only if 
f(x) = max{l(x) : 1 E L, 1 < f ) ,  
where 1(x) is defined by (2.1): 
l(x) = min laxi; 
i E I ( 1 )  
2) Let x0 E IEt? be a vector such that f(xO) > 0 and I = f(xO)/xO. Then 
1 ( x )  < f ( x )  for all x E R? and 1 (xO) = f (xO). 
The following proposition is a special case of Proposition 2.1. 
Proposition 2.2 Let f be an IPH function and let X c int IR; be a compact 
set. Then for each E > 0 there exists a finite set { x l , .  . . , x j )  c X ,  such that 
the function 
h(x) = max min $xi 
k s j  a € I ( l k )  
with lk = f (xk)/xk curries out a uniform lower approximation o f f ,  that is, 
0 < f(x) - h(x) 5 E for all x E X. 
Now we consider the following global optimization problem: 
minimize f ( x )  subject to x E X 
(2.7) 
where f is an ICAR function and X c IR; is a compact set. The cutting angle 
method for solving problem (2.7) has been proposed and studied in Rubinov 
(2000) (p. 420). This method reduces the problem (2.7) to a sequence of 
auxiliary problems: 
minimize h(x) subject to x E X 
(2.8) 

ON MINIMIZATION O F  MAX-h4IN FUNCTIONS 
9 
where the objective function h is defined by (2.4). 
The cutting angle method can be applied for minimization of an arbitrary 
Lipschitz function if the set X coincides with the unit simplex S: 
It follows from the following result (see Rubinov (2000) and references therein) 
Theorem 2.3 Let f be a Lipschitz positive function defined on S and g be a 
function defined on IR? by 
Then g(y) = f(y) for all y E S and g is an ICAR function if p > (2K)lnz 
where m = minyEs f (y) and K is the Lipschitz constant of f in 11 . 11 1 norm: 
K = 
sup 
I f  (XI - f(y)I 
z#y, z,yES 
l l x  - ~111 ' 
Let f be a Lipschitz function over S. Consider the function fd(x) = f (x) + d, 
where d > 0. Note that the Lipschitz constant off coincides with the Lipschitz 
constant of fd. Hence, for each p > 0 there exists d > 0 such that the extension 
of fd given by (2.9), is an ICAR function. However if d is a very large number 
the function g is "almost flat" and its minimization is a difficult task. On the 
other side, if d is small enough, then p is large and some computation difficulties 
can appear. Thus, an appropriate choice of a number d is an important problem. 
We shall consider the cutting angle method only for minimization of ICAR 
functions over S, then it can be applied also for minimization of Lipschitz 
functions defined on S. The main idea behind this method is to approximate 
the objective function g by a sequence of its saw-tooth underestimates hj of 
the form (2.4). Assume that hj (xk) = g(xk) for some points xk, k = 1, . . . , j 
and hj uniformly converges to g as j -+ +oo. Then a global minimizer of g can 
be approximated by a solution of the problem: 
minimize hj(x) subject to x E S. 
(2.10) 
Note that objective function of (2.10) is a max-min function (this is one of 
the simplest max-min functions.) The detailed presentation of a theory of the 

10 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTR.OL WITH APPLICATIONS 
cutting angle method can be found in Rubinov (2000). Here we discuss only 
methods for solution of the auxiliary problem (2.10). Some of them can be 
found in Rubinov (2000). The most applicable method can be given if the 
objective function g of the initial problem is IPH. In this case constant ck in 
(2.4) are equal to zero, hence hj is a positively homogeneous function. Using 
this property of hj it is possible to prove that all local minimizers of hj over S 
are interior points of S and then to give an explicit expression of local minima 
of g over S, which are interior points of S. (see Bagirov and Rubinov (2000) 
and also Rubinov (2000)). If g is an extension defined by (2.9) of a Lipschitz 
function f defined on S, then g is IPH if p = 1, so we need to choose a large 
number d in order to apply the cutting angle method. The question arises is it 
possible to extend results obtained for minimization of homogeneous functions 
of the form (2.6) for general non-homogeneous functions of the form (2.4). In 
the case of success we can consider more flexible versions of the cutting angle 
method, which can lead to its better implementation. 
2.2 The simplest max-min functions 
Thus in this subsection we shall study max-min functions of the form: 
h(x) = max min (1fxi - ck) , 
k < j  ZEI(P) 
where 1" 
(lf, . . . ,1:) 
E R; and ck E Rn, k 5 j. Sometimes we shall denote 
the function h in (2.11) by hj in order to emphasize the number of min-type 
functions in (2.11). The function h defined by (2.11) is the simplest (in a certain 
sense) non-trivial max-min function. 
We consider the following minimization problem: 
minimize h(x) subject to x E S. 
(2.12) 
Our goal is to describe all local minimizers of h over the unit simplex S. We 
shall also indicate the structure of such minimizers. Let 
k 
@k(x) = min lixi - ck, k = 1,. . ., j. 
i€I(lk) 
Then 
h(x) = max @k(x). 
k I j  

ON MINIMIZATION O F  MAX-MIN FUNCTIONS 
11 
We set 
Q ~ ( x )  = {i E I(lk) : ltxi - ~k = Qk(x)} . 
(2.14) 
The functions Qk, k = 1,. . . , j and h are directionally differentiable and 
QL(x, U) = , min $ui, u E lRn, 
(2.15) 
Z E Q ~ X )  
hl(x, U) = max Qk(x, u) = max 
min @ui, u E lRn . 
k ~ R ( x )  
(2.16) 
k ~ R ( x )  i ~ Q k ( x )  
Recall the definition of the cone K(x, S) of feasible directions at a point x E S 
with respect to the set S. By definition 
K(x, S) = {u E lRn : 3 a o  > 0 : x + a u  E S for all a E (0, ao)). 
Recall the well-known necessary and sufficient conditions for a local minimizer 
of a directionally differentiable function f over the set S (see, for example, 
Demyanov and Rubinov (1995)). 
Proposition 2.3 Let f be a directionally differentiable and locally Lipschitz 
function defined on S and x E S. Then 
1) if x is a local minimizer off over S then fl(x, u) 2 0 for all u E K(x, S); 
2) if fl(x, u) > 0 for all u E K(x, S) \ (0) then x is a local minimizer of f 
over S. 
Now we describe all local minimizers of the function h defined by (2.11). The 
function h is bounded from below on S. Adding a sufficiently large positive 
constant we can assume without loss of generality that h(x) > 0 for all x E S. 
First we consider minimizers, which belong to the relative interior riS of the 
set S: 
r i S = { x =  (xl ,..., x,) E S :  xi > 0 ,  Z E  I). 
Proposition 2.4 Let j 2 n and x E riS be a local minimizer of the function 
h over the set ri S such that h(x) > 0. Then there exists a subset {lk1, . . . , lkn) 
of the set {I1,. . . , lj) such that 1: 
> 0, i = 1,. . . , n and

h(x) + cki 
Proof. Let x E S be a local minimizer. It is easy to check that 
It follows from Proposition 2.3 that hl(x, u) 2 0 for all u E K(x, S). Applying 
(2.16) we conclude that for each u E K(x, S )  there exists k E R(x) such that 
Let m E I. Consider the following direction u = (ul, . . . , u,): 
Here Xi > 0, i E I\m and 
It follows from (2.17) that u E K(x, S), hence there exists k E R(x) such that 
Let Qk(x) be the set defined by (2.14). We shall prove that Qk(x) = {m). 
Assume that Qk(x) # {m). Then due to (2.15) we have a;(%, 
u) < 0 which 
contradicts (2.18). Thus Qk(x) = { m ) ,  SO for any m E I there exists at least 
one k E R(x) such that Qk(x) = {m). Let ml,m2 E I ,  ml # m2 and kmi be

an index such that Qki(x) = { m i ) ,  i = 1,2. Since ml # mz, it follows that 
km1 # km,. 
Let m E I and Ic, 
E R ( x )  be an arbitrary index such that Qk,(x) = { m ) .  
Then 
h ( x )  = Qk, ( x )  = lkm x ,  - ck, . 
(2.19) 
It follows from (2.19) that 
Due to the equality xi xi = 1, we have 
Since 
we conclude that 
h ( z )  2 min lkxi - ck for all k 5 j. 
(2.22) 
i€I(lk) 
It follows from (2.22) t,hat there exists p E I ( l k )  such that lix, - ck 5 h ( x ) .  
Combining this inequality with (2.20) we deduce that 
hence 
for all k 5 j. It follows from (2.21) that there exist indices k E R ( x )  and 
p E Q k ( x )  such that h ( x )  = Liz, - ck. Using again (2.20) we conclude that 

14

Take now any m E I and an index k, such that k, E R ( x )  and Qk, ( x )  = {m}. 
Then we have 
h(x) = @k,(x) = lhm xm - ~ k ,

We again consider the function (2.11) and Problem (2.12). In next propo- 
sition we will establish a sufficient condition for a local minimum in Problem 
(2.12). We assume that the function (2.11) possesses the following property: 
@k(x) := ,min lfxi - ck > 0 for all k 5 j and x E S. 
2 E I ( l k )  
It can be achieved by adding the same large number to all functions Qk, k 5 j.

then 5 is a local minimum of the function h over S and h ( 5 )  = d. 
Proof. It is sufficient to prove that h1(5,u) > 0 for all u E K ( 5 ,  S )  \ (0). 
By assumption Q k ( x )  > 0 for all x E S and k 5 j. Then for the point 
53 = (&, . . . ,&) E S ,  where Pi = l/n, i = 1,. . . ,n,, we have

which implies that

It follows from (2.26) that

Thus d > 0. 
Since x E S it follows that d + cki 2 0 for all i = 1 , .  . . , n. Due to (2.23) we 
have 
min (-$-*)so 
i € I ( l k )  
d + cki 
for all k 5 j. The latter means that for any k 5 j there exists i = ik E l ( l k )  
such that 
Combining this inequality with (2.25) we get 
l,"3i - ck 5 d for all k 5 j. 
Then 
h(5) = max min ( 1 : ~ ~  
- c ~ )  
5 d. 
k l j  & I ( l k )  
Finally, it follows from (2.23) and (2.24) that 
min l p 5 i  - ckp = d for all p = 1,. . . ,n. 
i € I ( I k p )  
Thus h ( 5 )  = d. Clearly

Moreover it follows from (2.24) that Qkm(5) = {m). Let u E K ( 5 ,  S ) ,  u # 0. 
Due to (2.17) we conclude that there exists m E (1,. . . , n )  such that urn > 0. 
We have that

Thus 
ht(5, u) > 0 for all u E K (5, S )  \ {0), 
which implies that 5 E S is a local minimum of the function h. 
It is easy to see that a function 
h ( x )  = rnax min ($xi - c k )  
k I j  i € I ( l k )  
with c,+ > 0 is positively homogeneous if and only if cr, = 0 for all k 5 j ,  that 
is

h ( x )  = rnax min li xi.

(2.27) 
Thus analogous results can be obtained for IPH functions from Propositions 
2.4 and 2.5 when ck = 0 for all k 2 0. This case has been studied in Bagirov 
and Rubinov (2000). 
Remark 2.1 For homogeneous max-min functions we have d > 0 and in this 
case we do not need assumption Q k ( x )  := minic1(p) lfxi > 0 for all k 5 j and 
x E S .  
The previous results and the following Proposition 2.6 allow one to describe 
all local minimizers of a homogeneous max-min function over the unit simplex: 
Proposition 2.6 (see Bagirov and Rubinov (2000)) Let j > n, 1"

0, k = 1,. . . , n, I1(lk)l = n, k = n + 1,. . . , j where e%s the kth orth vector 
and II(1)I is the cardinality of the set I(1). Then each local minimizer of the 
function h defined by (2.27) over the simplex S is a strictly positive vector. 
Remark 2.2 Proposition 2.6 remains true if II(1")I L 2 for k = n + 1,. . . , j.

Unfortunately the analogue of Proposition 2.6 for non-homogeneous func- 
tions of the form (2.11) does not hold. The following example confirms this 
assertion. 
Example 2.1 Consider t'he following max-min function: 
h ( x )  = max 
min (l$xi - ck) , x E S C R ~ ,  
k=l, ..., 5 i ~ I ( 1 k )  
where 
Let 
k 
@ k ( x ) =  min l i x i - c k ,  
x € S ,  k = l ,  ..., 5. 
a ~ I ( 1 k )  
We have 
1 
Q5(x) = - 
min (52x1, 104x2, 156x3, 208x4) + 10. 
25 
Consider the boundary point of S: 
We have 
@ l ( x l )  = 5.5, @2(x1) = 5.5, @3(x1) = 5.25, 
@4(x1) = 2, @5(x1) = 10 
Since 
h ( x l )  = max ~ ~ ( x l )  
k=1, ..., 5 
it follows that 
It is clear that x1 is the global minimum of the function 
over the set S. 
Moreover 
@5(x) > @5[x1) 

18

for all x E ri S and Q5(x) = Q5(x1) for a11 boundary points x. Since all the 
functions Qk, Ic = 1,. . . , 5  are continuous there exist E > 0 such that 
for all x E { y  E S : 11 y - x1 1 1  < €1. Hence x1 is a local minimizer of the function 
h. 
This example demonstrates that non-homogeneous max-min functions of the 
form (2.11) can attain their local minimum on the boundary of the set S. We 
now present a description of local minima, which are placed on the boundary 
of S. 
Proposition 2.7 Let x E S be a local minimizer of the function h defined by 
(2.1 1) over the simplex S such that h(x) > 0 and r = I I(x)l < n. Then there 
exists a subset {lk1', . . , l k ~ }  
of the set {I1,. . . , lj) such that

Let h' be the restriction of the function h to IR?. Clearly h' is a function of 
the form (2.11) and x is a local minimizer of this function. Since x E riS', we 
can apply Proposition 2.4. The result follows directly from this proposition. A 
Propositions 2.4 and 2.5 allows us to propose the following algorithm for the 
computation the set of local minimizers of the function h defined by (2.11) over 
riS.

go to Step 2.

2.3 Results of Numerical Experiments 
In this subsection we describe results of numerical experiments with minimiza- 
tion of max-min functions of the form (2.11), both homogeneous and non- 
homogeneous, over the unit simplex. First consider non-homogeneous func- 
tions of the form (2.11). We consider max-min functions, which appear as 
approximations of the following ICAR function: 
where 
( 15/(i + 0.u) 
otherwise. 
The following points on the unit simplex S were used for the construction of 
min-type functions: 
k 
x t =  $ *, y,=ilsin(i+k)l, 
k > n + l ,  i = l ,  ..., n. 
(2.31) 
Cp=lYp 
Due to Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 2.1, the approximation function has the 
form: 
h(x) = max min ((vf (xk)'x" - (f (xk) - ( o f  (.*).L, 
xk)) , 
(2.32) 
k l j  & I ( X ~ )  
X: 
where f defined by (2.28) with aij defined by (2.29). 
The algorithm for calculation of local minimizers, which was proposed in 
previous subsection, has been applied for the calculation of local minimizers of 
the function (2.32) over ri S.

The code has been written in Fortran 90 and numerical experiments have 
been carried out in PC IBM Pentium I11 with CPU 800 MHz. 
For the description of the results of numerical experiments we use the fol- 
lowing notation: 
n is the number of variables; 
j is the number of min-type functions; 
nl, is the number of local minimizers; 
tl is the CPU time for the calculation of the set of all local minimizers; 
t2 is the average CPU time for calculation of one local minimizer; 
nf is the average number of the objective function evaluations for the 
calculation of one local minimizer. 
Results of numerical experiments are presented in Table 2.1. 
Table 2.1 demonstrates that even so simple max-min function as (2.11) has a 
large number of local minimizers. Results of numerical experiments presented 
in this table show that the proposed algorithm calculates the set of local mini- 
mizers quickly enough for small size problems (up to 5 variables). The number 
of local minimizers increases sharply as the number of min-type functions in- 
creases. The proposed algorithm can calculate one local minimizer very quickly 
even for large number of variables and min-type functions. 
Consider now minimization of homogeneous max-min functions of the form 
(2.27): 
k 
h(x) = max min li xi. 
k 5 j  i € I ( l k )  
We consider max-min functions, which appear as approximations of the follow- 
ing IPH functions (see Bagirov and Rubinov ( 2001a)): 
where aij are numbers defined by (2.29).

DISCRETE MAX-MIN FUNCTIONS 
In this section we will consider the following minimization problem: 
minimize f (x) subject to x E Rn 
where 
f (x) = maxmin fij(x) 
i€I j€J 
and I, J are finite set of indices and functions fij are convex. The function f 
can be represented as the difference of two convex functions: 
where 
r 
1 
Therefore f is a quasidifferentiable in the sense by Demyanov and Rubinov 
(see Demyanov and Rubinov (1986); Demyanov and Rubinov (1995)) and its 
quasidifferential [2f (x), Bf(x)] can be calculated by using methods of quasid- 
ifferential calculus. Moreover this function is semismooth (see Mifflin (1977)). 
Some differential properties of this function have been studied in Kirjner- 
Neto and Polak (1998); Polak (1997); Polak (2003). The calculation of the 
Clarke subdifferential or the Demyanov-Rubinov quasidifferential of this func- 
tion is complicated. Therefore here we suggest the discrete gradient method 
to solve Problem (3.1). This method is derivative-free. Its description can 
be found, for example, in Bagirov (1999a); Bagirov (1999b). For the calcula- 
tion of the objective function an algorithm described in Evtushenko (1972) is 
used. This algorithm allows one to significantly accelerate the calculation of the 
objective function. The usage of this algorithm allows us to conclude that the 
calculation of the Clarke subdifferential or Demyanov-Rubinov quasidifferential 
of the discrete max-min functions is much more expensive than the calculation 
of values these functions. This means that methods, which use only values 
of the max-min functions, are more appropriate for their minimization. The 
discrete gradient method in conjunction with this algorithm allows us to solve 
minimization problems with discrete max-min objective functions. This local 
method sometimes can find even a global minimizer of a max-min function.

3.1 Results of numerical experiments 
In this subsection results of numerical experiments by using the discrete gradi- 
ent method are given. For the description of the test problems and the results 
of numerical experiments we use the following notation: 
f = f ( x )  is the objective function; 
xO is the starting point; 
x* is the local minimizer, f ,  = f (x*); 
n is the number of variables; 
iter is the number of iterations; 
nf is the number of the objective function evaluations; 
n d  is the number of the discrete gradient evaluations; 
time is the CPU time. 
Numerical experiments have been carried out in PC IBM Pentium I11 with 
CPU 800 MHz. All problems have been solved with the precision S = 
that is at last point xk: 
f ( x ~ )

the following max-min objective functions were considered:

OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS WITH MAX-MIN CONSTRAINTS 
Consider the following constrained optimization problem ( P ) :  
minimize f ( x )  
subject tox E X C ]Rn, 
gi(x) < 0 , i =  1 ,..., m,gi(x) =O,i=m+l, ..., m + k .  
We use a certain version of penalization for solving this problem. First we 
convolute all constraints gi (i = 1, . . . , m . . . , m + k )  to a single constraint fl: 
minimize f ( x )  subject to x E X ,  fl ( x )  5 0. 

28 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
The classical penalization of this function leads to the unconstrained minimiza- 
tion of the following penalty function: 
where f:(x) 
= max(fl (x), 0) and d is a large enough number. A number d, 
such that the optimal value of problem (PI) coincides with minZEx L+(x, d), 
is called the exact penalty parameter. The exact parameter d, if it exists, can 
be very large, so the problem 
minimize L+(x, d) subject to x E X, 
can be ill-conditioned. In order to reduce the exact parameter, we replace the 
objective function f with the objective function f,, where f,(x) = d
m
 
with a large enough number c. (It is assumed that f is bounded from below 
on X and c is a number such that f (x) + c 2 0 for all x E X. There are some 
ways to omit this assumptions, however we do not discuss them here.) This 
approach has been studied in Rubinov et a1 (2002). It was shown there that 
under some natural assumptions it holds: 
lim d, = 0, 
c++m 
where d, is the least exact penalty parameter for the problem (PC): 
minimize f,(x) subject to x E X, fl(x) 5 0. 
Thus instead of the initial problem (P) we consider the problem (PC) 
with 
a certain number c and the penalty function L+(x, d,) corresponding to (PC) 
with a certain penalty parameter d,. This approach allows one to use two large 
number c and d, instead of one "very large" number d (a penalty parameter 
for the problem (PI)). 
The described approach has been used for solving two test problems, which 
can be found in Kirjner-Neto and Polak (1998). 
Problem 3 The well-known Rosenbrock function is minimized subject to max- 
min constraints. The description of constraint functions are given in Kirjner- 
Neto and Polak (1998). Here we present only results of experiments. The 
described penalty method has been applied to solve this problem and then the 
discrete gradient method has been used to solve obtained unconstrained min- 
imization problem. Solving this problem with the starting point xO = (-1,l) 

ON MINIMIZATION O F  MAX-MIN FUNCTIONS 
29 
we obtained the local minimizer 5 = (0.552992,0.306732) (up to six digits), 
which corresponds to the objective function (in the original problem) value of 
0.1999038. This minimum was reached for 34 iterations and 274 objective func- 
tion (in the unconstrained minimization problem) evaluations. If we instead 
set xO = (1.5,1.5), after 54 iterations using 499 the objective function evalua- 
tions in the unconstrained optimization problem we obtained local minimizer 
Z = (1.199906,1.440341) which corresponds to the objective function value of 
0.039994 in the original problem. 
Problem 4 In this problem the well-known Beale function is minimized sub- 
ject to the same max-min constraints as in Problem 3. The described penalty 
method has been applied to solve this problem and then the discrete gradient 
method has been used to solve obtained unconstrained minimization problem. 
Solving this problem with the starting point xO = (1,l) we obtained the local 
minimizer E = (2.868929,0.466064) (up to six digits), which corresponds to the 
objective function (in the original problem) value of 0.003194. This minimum 
was reached for 32 iterations and 172 objective function (in the unconstrained 
minimization problem) evaluations. For the starting point xO = (1, -I), after 
43 iterations using 225 the objective function evaluations in the unconstrained 
optimization problem we obtained the same local minimizer.

MINIMIZATION OF CONTINUOUS MAXIMUM FUNCTIONS 
The cutting angle method requires to evaluate only one value of the objective 
function at each iteration. This property is very beneficial, if the evaluation of 
values of the objective function is time-consuming. Due to this property we can 
use the cutting angle method for solving some continuous min-max problems. 
Some details of this approach can be found in Bagirov and Rubinov (2001b). 
Let Y c Rm be a compact set and let cp(x, y) be a continuous function 
defined on the set Rn xY. Consider the following continuous min-max problem: 
find points 5 E Rn and y E Y such that 
We reduce (5.1) to the following unconstrained minimization problem 
minimize f (x) subject to x E IRn 

30 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
where 
We assume that the function y H cp(x, y) is concave for each y, then the 
evaluation of the values of function f can be easily done by methods of convex 
programming. The cutting angle method can be applied for problems with a 
small amount of external variables x, however the number of internal variables 
y can be large enough. Numerical experiments with such kind of functions were 
produced in Bagirov and Rubinov (2001b) and we do not repeat them here.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this paper we have considered different optimization problems with max-min 
objective and/or constraint functions. We have presented numerical methods 
which can be used for solving some of these problems. In particular, terminating 
algorithm for minimization of the simplest max-min functions over the unit 
simplex have been proposed. This algorithm allows one to describe the set 
of local minima of problems under consideration. We demonstrated that the 
discrete gradient method can be used to solve unconstrained minimization of 
the discrete max-min functions and a special penalty function method can 
be applied to solve optimization problems with max-min constraint functions. 
Finally, we have discussed possible applications of the cutting angle method to 
global minimization of the continuous maximum functions when the number 
of external variables is not large. Results of numerical experiments presented 
in this paper show that the considered methods are effective for solving some 
problems under consideration.

Abstract: The graphical derivative and the coderivative when applied to the 
proximal subdifferential are in general not generated by a set of linear operators 
Nevertheless we find that in directions at which the subjet (or subhessian) is 
supported, in a rank-1 sense, we have these supported operators interpolating 
the contingent cone. Thus under a prox-regularity assumption we are able to 
make a selection from the contingent graphical derivative in certain directions, 
using the exposed facets of a convex set of symmetric matrices. This allows 
us to make a comparison between some optimality conditions. A nonsmooth 
formulation of a standard smooth mathematical programming problem is used 
to derive a novel set of sufficient optimality conditions. 
Key words: Subhessians, coderivative inclusions, rank-1 representers, opti- 
mality conditions.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In this paper we shall concern ourselves only with second-order subderivatives 
that arise from one of two constructions. First, there is the use of the con- 
tingent tangent cone to the graph of the proximal subdifferential and its polar 
cone to generate the graph of the contingent graphical derivative and contingent 
coderivative. The second one is the use of sub-Taylor expansions to construct 
a set of symmetric matrices as replacements for Hessians, the so called subjet 
(or the subhessian of Penot (199411)) of viscosity solution theory of partial 
differential equations (see Crandall et al. (1992)). To each of these construc- 
tions may be associated a limiting counterpart which will also be considered at 
times. As the first of the above constructions produces a possibly nonconvex 
set of vectors in Rn and the latter a convex set of symmetric operators, it is 
not clear how to compare them. One of the purposes of this paper is to begin 
a comparative study of these notions for the class of prox-regular functions of 
Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996). A second objective is to consider what this 
study tells us regarding certain optimality conditions that can be framed using 
these alternative notions. We do not take up discussion of the second-order 
tangent cones and the associated second-order parabolic derivatives of func- 
tions, which is beyond our present scope. We refer the reader to Bonnans, 
Cominetti et al. (1999), Rockafellar and Wets (1998) and Penot (199412) and 
the bibliographies therein for recent accounts of the use of these concepts in 
optimality conditions. Important earlier works include Ben-Tal (1980), Ben- 
Tal et al. (1982), Ioffe (1990) and Ioffe (1991) Some results relating parabolic 
derivatives to subjet-like notions may be found in Eberhard (2000). 
Where possible we adhere to the terminology and notation of the book 'Vari- 
ational Analysis' by Rockafellar and Wets (1998), with the notable exception 
of the proximal subdifferential. Henceforth we assume f : R" 
-+ 
]FZ to be lower 
semi-continuous, minorized by a quadratic function, and 5 E dom f .  
Definition 1.1 A vector y E lRn is called a proximal sub-gradient to f at x if, 
for some c > 0, 
in a neighbourhood of x. The set of all proximal sub-gradients to f at x will be 
denoted by 8, f (x).

This in turn defines the basic subdifferential via limiting processes by 
d f (x) = lim sup dp f (5'). 
x'-f 
x 
Here x' +f x means x' -, x and f (x') + f (x). In general the proximal 
subdifferential is only contained in the subdifferential. Next we define one 
concept that forces equality. 
Definition 1.2 The function f is prox-regular at 3 for jj (E df (3)) with re- 
spect to E and c > 0 if f satisfies (1.1) whenever llx' - 311 < E and Ilx - 511 < E 
and If(x) - f(3)l < E ,  while Ily -jjll 
< E  with y E df(x). 
As noted in many papers (see, for example, Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996), 
Poliquin et al. (1996) and Rockafellar and Wets (1998)) prox-regular functions 
constitute an important class of nonsmooth functions in the applications of 
nonsmooth analysis to optimization and thus are currently undergoing intense 
study. The proximal subdifferential when applied to the indicator function 
ds(x) of a set S (defined to be zero if x E S and +oo otherwise) gives rise to 
the proximal normal cone NZ(3) := dpSS(3). This may in turn be used via 
limiting processes to define the normal cone for which dds(x) := Ns(x). For 
an arbitrary set-valued mapping F : IRn 2 IRm, the normal cone to its graph 
at a point y E F(x) gives rise to the coderivative mapping of Mordukhovich 
(1976)-Mordukhovich (1994), Kruger et al. (1980) and later studies by Ioffe 
(1986)-Ioffe (1989). We consider only the finite-dimensional case in this paper. 
Definition 1.3 Suppose F : XZY is a multifunction, (x, y) E Graph F and 
w E X. The Mordukhovich-Ioffe coderivative is defined as 
This multifunction is not necessarily convex-valued and generally has a very 
complicated structure. Another nonconvex set-valued derivative constructed 
from cones is the contingent graphical derivative. 
Definition 1.4 (Aubin) The graphical derivative (or contingent derivative) 
mapping of a multifunction F : XZ Y at (x, y) E Graph F in the direction 
w E X is defined by

Here TGraph ~ ( x ,  
y) := lim suptLo

is the contingent tangent cone. 
The generality of this construction enables one to apply this to various 
subdifferential multifunctions and hence arrive at a "second-order" theory of 
subdifferentiation, that is, for y E d,f(x) or y E df(x) we may construct 
D* (d f )  (x, y) (w) (see Mordukhovich (l998), Mordukhovich (2001) and Mor- 
dukhovich (2002) for recent results regarding the calculus of this object). A 
price is paid for going down this path in that the coderivative of the basic 
subdifferential is, in general, no longer related to operators that generalize 
Hessians in any obvious manner, except for cases when the functions involved 
are a composition or sum of sufficiently regular or smooth functions that ad- 
mit a classical Hessian. The use of calculus rules to derive explicit expression 
for D* (8 f)(x, y)(w) (the coderivative to the basic subdifferential) when f in- 
volves such a composition or sum has been undertaken in Mordukhovich (1984) 
and Mordukhovich (1994). Such results help to characterise the structure of 
these set-valued mappings in specific cases. We concern ourselves here with 
a more generic way of using certain symmetric operators to generate elements 
within the graphical derivative and coderivative to the proximal subdifferen- 
tial. The method used will be to establish certain inclusions which augment 
those of Rockafellar et al. (1997). Thus the intent, methods and results of 
this paper are quite distinct in character to those of Mordukhovich (1984) and 
Mordukhovich (1994). 
Another path may be taken to arrive at a second-order theory of the subd- 
ifferential. The strategy here is to extend the inequality (1.1) into a sub-Taylor 
expansion 
1 
f(x) 2 f (:) 
+ (y, x - 3) + -(Q(x - E ) ,  (X - 3)) + 0(11x -311~) (la2)

of order two, where Q is chosen to be a symmetric n x n matrix and 0(11x-~11~) 
is the usual Landau small-order notation. The subhessians are the set of all 
such operators and denoted d2'- f (x, y). This set is always unbounded. Indeed, 
the subjet contains many "redundant" operators, since all the negative semi- 
definite operators (denoted by -P(n)) are in the recession cone of d2*- f (x, y) 
when viewed as a convex set of operators in the linear space of all symmetric 
operators (denoted by S(n)). This cone induces a natural ordering in S(n). 
Once again the application of ideas from set-valued analysis may be used to 
define limiting versions of the subjet. Details are provided in the next section.

At this juncture the natural question arises as to whether there is any rela- 
tionship between d2>- 
f (x, y), D(dp f)(5, y) and D*(d, f ) ( x ,  y). The answer to 
this question is far from obvious as on first inspection we note that d2>- 
f (x, y) 
is a set of operators while D(dp f)(5, y) and D* (8, f )(x, y) are multifunctions 
whose images are contained in IRn. When f E c2(IFtn) 
all notions coincide in 
that 
Here the equality for the coderivative utilizes the symmetry of the operator 
V 2  
f (5) and 
f (x, V f (5)) denotes the Pareto efficient subset with re- 
spect to the partial order induced by P(n). Thus a possible relationship to 
consider is whether Q E d2'-f(x, y) is to have Qw E D*(d,f)(x,y)(w) or 
Qw E D(dp f )  (x, y) (w). In Rockafellar et al. (1997) conditions are given (which 
include prox-regularity of f at x, y) under which we have the inclusion 
When the polarity of the associated tangent and normal cones is taken into 
account, one can see that this inclusion does imply a kind of symmetry property 
for the elements of the contingent graphical derivative. This prompts one to 
conjecture that some elements of {Qw I Q E d2>- 
f (x, V f (5))) may also be 
contained in D (8, f ) (x, y ) (w) . 
In this paper we extend the inclusion (1.3) by considering the relationship 
of d2>- 
f (x, y) to D(dp f )  (x, y) (w). To do so we need to extract the correct op- 
erators from d21- f (x, y). The geometry of d21- f (x, y) is of critical importance 
in this development. Let us now introduce some elements of this geometry 
necessary to state our results. The F'robenius inner product (Q, B) = tr BtQ 
induces the quadratic form (Q, hht) = htQh = (Qh, h) when applied to a 
rank-one operator hht(- h @ h using tensor product notation). We call 
:= {Q E S ( n )  I q(A)(h) 2 (Q, hht) for all h )  
a symmetric rank-1 representer. The function q(A)(h) := sup{(&, hht) I Q E 
A )  : IRn H 
is called the symmetric rank-1 support function. We say that a 
rank-one representer A is exposed by the rank-one support in the direction w 
when 
W , w )  := {Q E A I q(A)(w) = (Q,wwt)) # 0. 

40 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
It was established in Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) that E(A, w) may 
be empty in some given directions. Despite this, we show in this paper that 
for an arbitrary rank-one representer we have E(A, w) # Q) for a dense subset 
in bf (A) := {W I q(A)(w) < +m). 
A multifunction I? : XZ Y is generated by a set of operators A G S(n) if 
r(w) = Aw = {Qw I Q E A). In Ioffe (1981) it is established that fans and 
hence many derivative-like objects are, in general, not generated by a set of 
linear operators. In this paper we investigate an alternative notion. 
Definition 1.5 We say that a multifunction I? : XZ Y is rank-one generated 
by a set A of bounded linear operators A : XZ Y if 
Here we are concerned with the question of when a multifunction il : XZ Y 
admits a rank-1 selection. That is, an operator I? : X= Y defined as above 
with F(w) & il(w) for at least a dense set of points in domil. We can now 
state the inclusions proved in this paper. Suppose f is prox-regular at x with 
respect to y. Suppose in addition that Q E E(d21- f (x, y), w) and choose w 
such that

:= liminf - (f (5 + tw') - f (5) - t(y, w'))

Then (w, Qw) E TcraphaPf ( x , ~ ) ,

ferential, that is, there exists a rank-1 selection of the graphical derivative 
If we posit the same assumptions as in Rockafellar et al. (1997), then we have 
immediately 
Thus we are able to make a selection from these non-convex set-valued deriv- 
atives using certain rank-1 exposed facets of a convex set of symmetric ma- 
trices. The construction of such matrices is often possible and provides an 
alternative path to the generation of elements within D(dp f)(x, y)(w) and 
D* (df) (5, jj)(w). This just the kind of selection which must be calculated

if numerical optimization procedures are to be developed using such second- 
order information. We give an example for suprema of smooth functions. 
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details various definitions 
and concepts. Section 3 discusses the geometry of rank-1 representers that 
is necessary for later proofs and consequently is partly a survey of results, 
although some new results are derived. Section 4 surveys the necessary material 
we use from the field of generalized convexity. Again some new results appear. 
Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to the development of the promised comparisons 
and inclusions, and contains no material previously published. 
Finally, in Section 7, we explore some consequences of these results in the 
study of sufficient conditions for isolated, strict local minima of nonsmooth 
functions. A number of new observations are made. The inclusions devel- 
oped allow us to compare various second-order optimality conditions based 
on different second-order subdifferentials. To study the particular case of a 
standard mathematical programming problem, we make use of the penalized 
Lagrangian method of Andromonov (2001). We derive a sufficient optimality 
condition for the so called "strict local minimum of order two" of Auslender 
(1984), Studniarski (1986) and Ward (1995)-Ward (1994). These conditions 
are of a novel character for three reasons. First is that no standard regularity 
condition is assumed. Secondly, one does not necessarily have to demand that 
VL(Z,d) = 0, where VL(3, d) denote the usual Lagrangian function of the 
problem and d the optimal Lagrange multipliers. Thirdly, the second-order 
conditions involve some interaction of the geometry of the constraint set at the 
optimal point Z via the curvature of the active constraints in directions h for 
which (VL(Z, d), h) 1 0.

PRELIMINARIES 
In this section we define and discuss a number of concepts used throughout 
the paper. We assume a working knowledge of variational derivatives and 
the associated notion of convergence of sets taken from set-valued analysis 
(see Rockafellar and Wets (1998) and Aubin et al. (1990)). The convergence 
notation used is standard and as we are working in finite dimensions there is 
no confusion regarding which of the many possible convergence notions is being 
used. One may always assume we are using Kuratowski-Painlev6 convergence 
notions (see Rockafellar and Wets (1998) and Attouch (1984)). For a family of

Denote by S(n) the set of all real n x n symmetric matrices and by R+ (re- 
spectively E) the real intervals [0, +m) (respectively (-co,

convex set in a vector space X, denote the recession directions of C by O+C = 
{x E X I C + x C C). When C is not convex, we denote the horizontal direc- 
tions by Cm := {x E X I 3pn J 0 and cn E C such that x = lirn,,,

In the introduction we defined the notions of proximal subdifferential and

in nonsmooth analysis.

Definition 2.2 Let f : lRn H E be lower semi-continuous, Z E dom f and Z ,  
z, h E lRn. Put A,f(x,t,p,u) :=2$[f(x+tu) - f ( x )  -t(p,u)].

2. The lower second-order epi-derivative at 2 with respect to z and h is 
given by 
f ! ( ~ ,  z, h) := liminf A2 f (5, t, z, ht) = e-li tloA2 f ( Z ,  t, 2, h).

3. A function f : X --+ R is said to be twice sub-differentiable (or possess a 
subjet) at x zf the set

f ( x )  = {(v(P(x), v2cp(x)) I (P E c2(lRn) and

5. The set 22 f (x, p) = {Q E S ( n )  I (p, Q) E 3 f ( x ) )  is called the limiting 
subhessians o f f .  
As -a2>- f (x, -p) = d2*+ 
f (x,p) we study only the subjet. One may de- 
fine corresponding superjet quantities by reversing the inequality. I t  must be 
stressed that these quantities may not exists everywhere but d2>- 
f ( x )  and 
dp f (x) are defined densely. I f  f!(Z,p, h) is finite, then fl(3, h) = (p, h), where

at 3 with respect to z and h, which is given by

When f:(E,p, h )  = f;l(Z,p, h )  := fc(?,p, h ) ,  we say f possesses a second-order 
epi-derivative. 
We recall that there is a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of X x Y 
and the graphs Graph F := { ( x ,  y) I y E F ( x ) )  of multifunctions F : X Z Y .  
The next concept has been extensively studied (see, for example, Rockafellar 
(1989) and Rockafellar (1988)). 
Definition 2.3 The intermediate cone is given by 
GraphF - ( x ,  y) 
TAraph ( x ,  y) := lim inf

A multifunction is said to be proto-dzfferentiable if this cone coincides with the 
contingent cone, that is, 
Using this tangent cone and the contingent tangent cone one may define 
many derivative like concepts using the multifunction F ( x )  := f ( x )  + [0, +m) 
with graph Graph F = epi f .  It is well-known that the contingent cone to 
epi f corresponds to the epigraph of the function h H fJ(x, h )  (see Aubin et al. 
(l99O), Rockafellar (1989) and Rockafellar (1988)). Also proto-differentiability 
of epi f corresponds to first-order epi-differentiability of f .

In finite dimensions the subjet concept is closely related to the proximal 
differential. Denote by P(n) the cone in S(n) of all positive semi-definite 
symmetric matrices. It is well-known (see Penot (1994/1)) that d2>- 
f (5) # 0 
is equivalent to d,f(Z) # 0 which is in turn equivalent to the existence of 
(p, X )  E lRn xS(n) such that 
fr(5, p, h) 2 ( X ,  hht) for all h. 
This prompts the following definitions (see Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph 
(1998)). 
Definition 2.4 Denote by M(n, m )  the class of real n x m matrices. 
1. The rank-one hull of a set A C M(n, m) is given by 
A' = { A  E M(n, m )  I (A, vut) 5 q(A)(u, v) for all v E lRm, u E lRn), 
where q(A) (u, v) := sup{(Q, vut) I Q E A). 
2. A set A is said to be a rank-one representer if A1 = A. 
3. When A C S(n), the set of real symmetric matrices, we denote the sym- 
metric rank-1 support by q(A)(u) := sup{(Q,uut) I Q E A )  and the 
symmetric rank-1 hull by 
A: = { A  E S(n) I (A, uut) I q(A)(u) for all u E lRn). 
4. The rank-1 (resp. E-rank-1) supported points in the direction u are given 
respectively by 
E(A, u) := { A  E A I (A, uut) = q(A)(u)) and 
E,(A, u) := { A  E A I (A, uut) 2 q(A)(u) - E )  . 
5. When -P(n) c O+A 5 S(n) we define the symmetric rank-one barrier 
cone as bi (A) := {u E lRn I q(A) (u) < 00). 
Remark 2.1 If we restrict attention to S(n) and sets A such that -P(n) C 
O+A, then q(A)(u,v) = +oo unless v = u. Thus in this case we need only 
consider the symmetric supports q(A)(u) and A; = A'. Indeed we always have 
-P(n) C 0+{A E S(n) I (A, uut) 5 q(A)(u) for all u E lRn) and q(A - 
P(n)) (u) = q(A) (u) . Even E(A, u) contains recession directions in -P(n) .

be convex, just as dp f (5) is convex while df (5) often is not. Eberhard, Nyblom 
and Ralph (1998) observed that 
(f (Z + th') - f (5) - t(p, h')) 
t-0 
h1+h 
:= f:(P,p, 
u). 
Hence if we work with subjets we are in effect dealing with objects dual to the 
lower, symmetric, second-order epi-derivative. The study of second-order di- 
rectional derivatives as dual objects to some kind of second order subdifferential 
was begun in J.-B. Hiriart-Urruty (1986), Seeger (1986) and Hiriart-Urruty 
et al. (1989). These works studied the particular case where f is a convex 
function. 
Definition 2.5 The function f is subdzfferentially continuous at P for G, where 
G E df (P), if for every S > 0 there exists E > 0 such that If (x) - f (%)I 5 6 
whenever Ix - PI 5 E and Iv - GI 5 E with v E df (x). 
In general we have for all h (see Ioffe and Penot (1997)) that 
q (d2f ( 3 , ~ ) )  
(h) 
= sup{(Q,hht) I Q E d2f(%p)) I fTT(%p,h) 
where (xf,p') --+s,(f) 
(P,p) means x' + 5, f (XI) + f (lc), z' E dp f (XI) and 
p' + p. Equality holds when f is prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous 
(see Corollary 6.1 of Eberhard (2000)).

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUPPORTED OPERATORS 
In this section we outline some important facts regarding the geometry of rank- 
1 sets which are relevant to later sections. We show that there is a dense set 
of directions h E bi(A) for which a rank-1 representer A has E(A, h) # 0. We 
discuss also some results from previous papers relevant to the characterization 
of rank-1 exposed operators, as these figure strongly in the later development 
of the paper. One can completely characterise symmetric rank-one supports. 
The following characterization may be found in Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph

(1998). This result generalizes those of J.-B. Hiriart-Urruty (1986) and Seeger 
(1986) which treats only the case when the symmetric rank-1 support happens 
to be a convex function. The results of J.-B. Hiriart-Urruty (1986) and Seeger 
(1986) are sufficient to study the second-order derivative notion for convex 
functions (see, for example, Seeger (1992), Hiriart-Urruty et al. (1989) and 
Seeger (1994)), while Theorem 3.1 below is applicable to a more general study 
of second-order epi-derivatives. Important as these earlier works are, they do 
not figure in the present development. 
Theorem 3.1 Let p : Rn H ]R be proper (that is, p(u) # -co anywhere). For 
u, v E Rn, define q(u, v) = co if u is not a positive scalar multiple of v or vice 
versa, and q(au,u) = q(u,au) = ap(u) for a > 0. 
Then q is a symmetric rankone support of a set A C S(n) with -P(n) C 
O+ A if and only if 
1. p is positively homogeneous of degree two; 
2. p is lower semicontinuous; 
Even in finite dimensions there may not exist, in every direction, an operator 
in a given rank-1 representer achieving the symmetric rank-one support. Thus 
some caution is required in the subsequent development when using rank-1 
exposed facets and operators. 
As noted earlier we endow S(n) with the Frobenius inner product (Q, A) = 
tr AtQ. The natural norm induced by this inner product is the so-called pro- 
jective norm llAllproj , given by 
Here llQllop = supllzllzll 11Q~11~ 
denotes the usual operator norm induced by 
the Euclidean norm. One may use the symmetric rank-1 support to reconstruct 
the support of the symmetric rank-1 representer as a convex subset of S(n), 
confirming that all relevant data for this problem is contained in such rank-one 
facets. We quote the following result from Eberhard (2000).

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Theorem 3.2 Let dimS(n) = m (= 5 (n + 1)). Then i f  A is a rank-one 
representer which has -P(n) G O+A, we have for any Q E P(n) that

On the space S(n) we may define the barrier cone to A (as a convex subset) 
by b(A) := {P E S(n) I S(A, P) < 00). 
Recall that an exposed point of A is the unique maximizer Q in A of a linear 
function 
( a ,  P). Recall also that P(n) induces a natural ordering in the space 
S(n) with respect to which we may define a Pareto (or undominated) subset of 
the rank-1 representer A. We quote next another result from Eberhard (2000) 
that we require in this section. 
Corollary 3.1 Any point Q E A which is supported by a linear functional 
(., P) on S(n) also lies on at least as many rank-one supporting hyperplanes as 
the rank of P. I n  particular i f  Q is an exposed point of A, then it is a Pareto 
maximizer of E(A, h) for some h. 
In convex analysis the concept of supporting points plays an important role. 
Unfortunately even when bi (A) = IRn we are not assured of the existence of a 
supporting point for the rank-one support. See Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph 
(1998) for an example of a rank-one representer with E(A, u) = 0 for a given 
direction u E bi(A) = IRn. Thus it is not immediately clear that rank-one 
supported operators are sufficiently numerous to provide a description of the 
rank-one representer. The best that can be hoped for is E(A,u) # 0 for a 
dense set in bi (A). 
Denote by aS(A,Q) the subdifferential (in the sense of ordinary convex 
analysis) of the convex support Q' H S(A)(Qt) at a given point Q E S(n). It 
is a standard result in convex analysis that dS(A, Q) = { A  E A I S(A, Q) = 
(A, Q)). It is well-known that aS(A, Q) reduces to a singleton almost every- 
where in int b(A) at which VS(A, Q) € b d d  is the unique supporting point, 
that is, the intersection of the supporting hyperplane and the set A). Even 
when int b(A) = 0, we know from Section 20D of Holmes (1975) that any lower 
semi-continuous convex function (on a Banach space) still has aS(A, Q) # 0 
densely on its effective domain. We need the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1 Suppose that Q = ziEF

Proof We have Q = CiEF 
U ~ U ;  = U U ~  + Qg, where Qs E Bp(0). It follows 
that for all v E (u)l with llvll = 1, we have ziEF 
(ui, v)' = (Qg, vvt) and so 
CiEF(ui, 
21)' < b2, as (Qs, vvt) I IIQsll llvl12 < b2. By a theorem of Hormander 
(see Holmes (1975)) we have for M = {au I a E IR) that there exists v E

d(ul, M )  = sup {(u', w) - S(M, w)) = (u', v).

Let ai attain the minimum in min, llui - aull Using (3.2) for each i ,  we 
have vi E ( u ) l  n B1 (0) such that d(ui, M )  = (ui, vi) and so

with Q = CiEF

We may prove the promised density of directions in b:(A) that expose A in 
a symmetric rank-1 sense. 
Theorem 3.3 Suppose that A is a rank-one representer with -P(n) C O+A 
and with bl(A) # 0. Then the set of directions u for which E(A,u) # 0 is 
dense in b1 (A). 
Proof Take an arbitrary nonzero u E b(A). As dS(A, P) # 0 densely there 
exists a sequence Pm + uut(# O ) ,  where Pm E P(n) and 
By Lemma 3.1 we have for any representation Pm = 
u , " ( u ~ ) ~

dimS(n)+ 1) that u," + aiu (taking a subsequence and renaming if necessary).

a? = 1 are the accumulation points of the a's in Lemma 3.1. Thus 
for any E > 0 we have for m L mo that Iluy - aiull I

and IIuyll 5 E for all i with ai = 0. For each m, the supporting point A,

By Corollary 3.1 there exists a representation

Remark 3.1 In Eberhard (2000), Corollary 6.2 it is shown that iff is prox- 
regular at 5 for p E df (5) and in addition possesses a second-order epi- 
derivative at 5, then E (a2>-f

h) # 0 for all directions in the relative 
interior of the set b1 (a2>- 
f ( z , ~ ) ) .  
As noted earlier the identification of rank-1 exposed points is of importance 
in the development of later results. With regard to the supported points of a 
rank-1 representer, we have the following result (see Eberhard, Nyblom and 
Ralph (1998), Theorem 4 and Eberhard (2000), Theorem 4.2). 
Theorem 3.4 Suppose that A 2 S(X) is a rank-one representer with -P(X) 
O+A and u E b(A). Then (2Au, 2A) E d21-S(A)(u) and A E A if and only if 
A E E(A,u). 
It should be noted that Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) contains a 
counterexample to the possible conjecture that (2Au, 2A) E d21-S(A)(u) im- 
plies A E A. 
We finish this section by consider what effect the infimal convolution (or 
Moreau envelope) has on the rank-1 support of a rank-1 representer and its 
rank-1 exposed operators. Recall that the infimal convolution (Moreau enve- 
lope) of a function f is defined via 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
51 
This is finite when the function f is proper, lower semi-continuous and mi- 
norized by a quadratically function y - & 11 . -y112 
with r > 0 (see Rockafellar 
and Wets (1998) Example 1.44). In this case each fx is proper and lower semi- 
continuous. The supremum of all parameters r is called the prox-threshold 
of f. It is well-known that fx is pointwise nondecreasing with decreasing X 
and epi-convergent to f as X + 0 (see Rockafellar and Wets (1998) Example 
1.44 and Proposition 7.4 (d)). Note that even when int dom f = 0 we have fx 
finite-valued everywhere (for X sufficiently small) as long as f is quadratically 
minorized (or prox-bounded). Thus dom fx = IRn. Moreover fx can be shown 
to be locally Lipschitz continuous. In Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) we 
may find the following series of results. 
Definition 3.1 Suppose that A is a rank-1 representer. Put 
1 
Q E S(n) I (Q,uut) I 2qx(-A)(u) for all u E IRn 
2 
where 
Write a:'- f (x, 0) = (a2>- 
f (x, 0))x. Not surprisingly we have the following 
(see Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998)). 
Theorem 3.5 Let A be a rank-one representer with -P(n) 2 o+A. Then 
the infimal convolution of the support u H q(A)(u) is also the support of a 
rank-1 representer. That is, there exists a rank1 representer Ax for which 
-P(n) = O+Ax and 
Q X / ~ ( ~ ) ( U )  
= q(A~)(u). 
Note that, since q(A~)(u) = qx(d)(u) I q(A)(u) for all U, we have Ax C A. 
We now quote a couple of results from Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) 
detailing the approximation properties of the infimal convolution which will be 
used in subsequent proofs. In particular we have the following. 
Theorem 3.6 Suppose that f : IRn t+ ]R is a lower semi-continuous, prox- 
bounded function. We have for all X > 0 suficiently small that 

52 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
and so 
Some related observations may be found in Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996). 
The limiting behaviour is also good (see Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998)). 
Theorem 3.7 Suppose that f : Rn H is a lower semi-continuous function 
which is pros-bounded. Then for all X > 0 suficiently small 
Such smoothing may be viewed alternatively in terms of infimal convolution 
smoothings of the associated quadratic forms rather than the smoothing of the 
rank-one support (see Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998), Proposition 7). 
An alternative approach to these results follows from the following observation 
communicated to us by A. Seeger. Suppose star denotes the convex conjugate. 
The form qQ(u) := (Q, uut) has an infimal convolution characterised by 
-m 
if I+ XQ $ P(n) 
Q(I+~Q)+ (h) 
if I + XQ E P(n)\ (int P(n)) , h E Im ( I  + XQ) 
q;+xQ(h) = 
~(I+AQ)-I (h) 
if I + XQ E int P(n) 
+m 
i f h $ I m ( I + X Q ) .  
Here Im (I + XQ) denotes the image or range and (I+ XQ)+ the Moore-Penrose 
inverse. Thus I + XQ E int P(n) is a necessary and sufficient condition for 
(QQ)x/~ 
= qQx where 
Such results have a long history when one notes that QA is constructed via a 
'parallel sum' (see Mazure (1996), Anderson et al. (1969) and Seeger (1991)). 
The following result is very useful in subsequent proofs (see Eberhard, Nyblom 
and Ralph (1998)). 
Proposition 3.1 Suppose that A is a ranlc-one representer with -P(n) 
O+A. Then for X > 0 suficiently small we have 
(A)A = {&A 
I Q E A and QA is a quadratic form) - 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES

The next result allows us to study E(d, .) via the more regular E (Ax, 
0 ) .  
Proposition 3.2 Suppose A is a non-empty rank-one representer. If Q E 
E(A, h), then for all X > 0 suficiently small we have Qx E E(Ax, hx), where 
hx = (I + XQ) h + h as X -t 0 and q(Ax)(hx) = q(A)(h) + XllQhl12. 
Proof Since (Q, hht) 5 q(A)(h) for all h, application of the infimal convolu- 
tion (with parameter X-') 
to both sides of this inequality provides (Qx, uut) 5 
qx(A)(u) = q(Ax)(u) for all u. Thus Qx E Ax. For X-'

and so the problem inf, { (Q, rlr)t) + 3 1 1  h - r)1I2} has a unique solution at r) = 
(I + XQ)-' h. In particular, for any fixed h E Rn, we have for each X-'

that hx := (I + XQ) h has h = (I + XQ)-' 
hx. Thus 
(Qx, hxh:) 
= (Q, hht) + illhA - hl12 
When Q E E(A, h) we have q(A) (h) = (Q, hht) and so 
which implies Qx E E(Ax, hx).

GENERALIZED CONVEXITY AND PROXIMAL SUBDERIVATIVES 
We shall need to use the notion of a generalized subgradient with respect to 
certain generalized convexity generating classes of functions @. The following 
concept was probably first introduce in Ky Fan (1963). 
Definition 4.1 Let Q be subset of the mappings cp : lRn -+ E. A function f is 
called @-convex if f(x) = sup,,@, cp(x) for some subclass Q' 2 Q. 
It is widely recognised that the differential information extracted from the func- 
tions in such Q-subdifferentials provided information regarding certain subdif- 
ferentials of nonsmooth analysis (see Rockafellar and Wets (1998)). This section 
concerns itself with the problem of quantifying this relationship more formally. 
Notions of abstract convexity were introduced in Janin (1973) and devel- 
oped later in Balder (1977) and Dolecki et al. (1978). This approach has a 

54 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
long history. Many earlier papers were concerned with the case of paracon- 
vex/paraconcave functions (or stronglweak convexity) (see Penot and Volle 
(1988) and Vial (1983)). Essentially this corresponds to taking the class @ to 
consist of quadratics with a fixed maximum negative curvature. This restric- 
tion is dispensed with in Dolecki et al. (1978) and greatly generalized via the 
use of abstract 'dualities' (see Martinez-Legaz (1988) and Martinez-Legaz and 
Singer (1995)). This approach is detailed in the text of Singer (1997). This 
approach is developed in a different direction and applied to many optimization 
problems in Rubinov (2000). 
The approach discussed above is more general than required here as we 
require only the use of abstract conjugations in the spirit of Pallaschke and 
Rolewicz (1998). This approach has been exploited in Eberhard, Nyblom and 
Ralph (1998)-Eberhard (2000) to study the approximate subdifferential and 
consequently the basic subdifferential along with certain second-order deriva- 
tive concepts. It has long been recognised that abstract convexity gives infor- 
mation about the subdifferentials of nonsmooth analysis. One of the contribu- 
tions of Eberhard and Nyblom (1998) was to show that, in finite dimensions, 
the study of the a2-subdifferential was equivalent to the study of the proximal 
subdifferential for the class of lower semi-continuous, prox-bounded functions. 
To establish this one must show how to extend the local inequalities (1.1) and 
(1.2) to ones which hold globally. The reason for doing this is that generalized 
conjugates require global suprema rather than local ones. We present a result 
of this kind in this section but defer the long proof to an appendix. 
As we are mainly concerned with sub-Taylor expansions, the class 
I with cp E c'(R") 
and r : R+ - R and limr(t) = 0 
tl0 
will be of importance in subsequent proofs. Clearly it follows that cp E dJ,(zl f (5) 
implies (Vcp(Z), V2cp(5)) E 8'1- f (5). 
Lemma 4.1 Suppose there exists afunction w(.) : R+ 
++ R with lirntlo ~ ( t )  
= 
0 such that 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
55 
Then there exists a function E(.) : IR+ H

E C2(IRn) satisfying n ( r , % )  := 
( V r ( 5 ) ,  v 2 r ( 5 ) )  = (0,O) and (4.1) is satisfied with E in place of w. 
The proof is deferred to the appendix. We shall provide a proper introduction 
to the operator q in Definition 4.4. 
Corollary 4.1 Suppose f : Rn + R is prox-bounded (or 
bounded). If 
(p, X )  E d2,- f ( Z ) ,  then there exists 7 : R+ -t R+ such that 
belongs to d~,(,)f (5). 
Proof It follows from Lemma 4.1 that this may be achieved locally around 5. 
To extend outside this neighbourhood we follow the proof of Eberhard, Nyblom 
and Ralph (1998) Proposition 6, noting that we may begin with equation (4.1) 
of Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) replaced by (4.1) locally about 3, that 
is, with -r(ll% - x11)115 - x1I2 E C2(Rn) replacing the term -Xllx - 
% / I 2 .  
The 
argument of Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) Proposition 6 now applies 
and establishes the result. 
Thus any cp E J2(Z) that satisfies the subgradient inequality locally around 
5 may be suitably modified outside a neighbourhood of Z to arrive at a sub- 
gradient inequality that holds globally. Thus for all u 
This generalized Fenchel inequality may be used to define a generalized deriv- 
ative. 
Definition 4.2 Let f : X t+ 
be a @-convex function. Then 
1. the @-conjugate is given by fC(cp) :=  sup,,^ (cp(u) - f (u)); 
2. the Fenchel inequality is f ( x )  + f C ( c p )  L cp(x); 
5'. the @-subdifferential is d~ f ( x )  := {cp E 
I f ( x )  + f ' ( c p )  = cp(x)); 
Consider the class 

56 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
In Eberhard, Nyblom and Ralph (1998) and Eberhard and Nyblom (1998) it is 
shown that the proximal subdifferential of Rockafellar, Murdukhovich and Ioffe, 
denoted by dp f (x), is equivalently characterised via dp f (x) = {Vcp(u)l,,, 
I cp E 
da2 f (x)) := Vd@, f (2). This is a set of elements from X* rather than a set 
of nonlinear functions defined on X. One may see that dp f (x) C Vda f (x) for 
any class 
C @ 
C2(lRn). It should be noted that such @-convex functions 
are simply those lower semi-continuous functions which are bounded below by 
some cp E @. Traditionally this has been termed @-bounded (see Dolecki et al. 
(1978)). If cp E dC2 f (I), then by taking c > p(~2cp(5)) (the spectral radius) 
we have .J, E d@, f (I) with .J,(x) := cp(I) + (Vcp(x), (z - I)) - $ 1 1 ~  - 5Il2, since 
locally around I 
We may "globalize" this inequality using Proposition 2.2 of Eberhard and Ny- 
blom (1998). This globalization property for a2-bounded functions may be 
generalized to the class C2(lRn) as shown by Proposition 6 in Eberhard, Ny- 
blom and Ralph (1998). Thus we always have dp f (5) = Vd@ f (x) for any class 
@2 c @ c C2(IR"). 
If a function is not -cm anywhere and f $ +cm (that is, f is proper), then 
to be a supremum of 
functions it must be at least bounded below by one 
such function, that is, Q2-bounded. When one is interested only in the local 
differentiability properties of the function, this assumption may be dropped by 
setting f (x) = +oo for x 4 B6(5). If f is lower semi-continuous then S > 0 
may be chosen so that the resultant function is actually bounded below by a 
constant. This will not affect the local differentiability properties of f at I.

precise choice of E open for time being but note that in Eberhard and Nyblom

(1998) it is shown that for the choice E = { ~ t  
I E > 0 )  the quantities d$, f ( x )  
approximate the proximal subdifferential in that for all 6 > 0 and any E 2 0 
we have (slightly abusing notation in suppressing the t for ~t E 2) 
In particular this implies that V d &  f ( x )  in effect estimates the closed sets 
6'; f (5) = 8- f (5) + E ~ ~ ( O ) ,  
where d- f (5) = { z  I (2, y) I f!(5; y) for all y )  is 
the lower Dini subdifferential. As E J, 0 both will approximate the closure of 
the proximal subdifferential dp f ( x )  = VdGz f (5). In order to drop the closure 
operation we need the following concept. 
Definition 4.4 We say a function f is E-proximally regular at 5 i f  V d g ,  f (Z)la 
(the set of points generated by evaluating these derivatives at 5 )  is closed for 
a l l ~ t  
E E:= { ~ t

Corollary 4.2 Let f : lRn H 
]R be lower semi-continuous and @2-bounded. 
Then 
v a g f ( q  = v a g , f ( q  = a , - f ( ~ )  
for any class a2 C 5 C2(lRn). In particular for all 6 > 0 we have V d $  f (5) c 
vd:Z6 f (5) and when V d &  f (5) is closed for all E > 0 (that is, is E-proximally 
regular) we have V d z  f ( 5 )  = V d &  f (5). 
Proof The result will follow immediately on showing V d $  f (5) 5 vd:f6 f (5) for 
all 6 > 0. If z E V d $  f (5), then by definition z = Vcp(5) for some cp E 8; f (5).

and so V d g f ( 5 )  = V d &  f(Z) = c f ( i t ) .  If ~ d : : ~ f ( i t )  is closed for all 6 > 0, 
then as noted in Theorem 5.1 part 1 (c) of Eberhard and Nyblom (1998) the 
closures may be dropped. 
We note that J2(Z) is indeed a convex conic subspace of C2(Rn) which clearly 
contains a2 (for any Z ) .  Put D h ( f )  := { x  I a;,(,) f (s) # 0 for all E > 0 ) .

is a closed subset of S(n) (with the operator norm). We 
must now consider the relationship between V2d52(,) f (Z,p) and e>- 
f ( f  ,p). 
Clearly d$- f ( 3 , ~ )  
is closed for any e 2 0 and it follows from definitions that 
V2d52(,) f ( 5 , ~ )  
G 81- f ( 5 , ~ ) .  
We wish to show that equality holds. To do 
so we need the following slight generalization of Lemma 5.2 in Eberhard and 
Nyblom (1998). The proof is easily extended to this more general context. 
Lemma 4.2 Let g : Rn -t 
be a proper lower semi-continuous @-bounded 
function and cp E @. Then for all e 2 0 
With this in hand it is easy to extend Eberhard and Nyblom (1998) Propo- 
sition 5.1 to the form we state next without proof.

Proposition 4.1 Let g : lRn +

We can now show the equivalence of two notions. 
Lemma 4.3 Suppose f : lRn H 
is lower semi-continuous and proper. Then 
V2d52(z, f (3, p) = @- f (5, p) and so v2d;2(,) f (3, P )  is closed.

apply Lemma 4.1 to obtain r(.) : lR+ H lR+ with r(.)ll . -5112 E C2(lR) such 
that cp(x) := (p,x-Z)+$(X, ( X - Z ) ( X - % ) ~ )  -r(llx-Z11)11~-511~ E dJzcm)

Then (p, Q )  E ~ d ~ , ( ~ )

the result V2dJ,(z) f ( z , ~ )  
= d2>- f ( E , ~ )  
follows. Now apply this result to the 
function x H f ( x )  + E I I X  -

we have d J 2 ( q ( f  + € 1 1  . - ~ 1 1 ~ ) ( 5 , ~ )  
= d J z ( q  f (5,p) + € 1 1  . -?ill2. We have via an 
elementary argument that LIZ?-(f + € 1 1  . -5112)(5, p) = 821- f (5, p) + 2eI. This 
gives 
Because the closure is required to relate Vdcz f ( x )  and dp f ( x ) ,  we can equate 
~ d 5 ~ ( , )  
f (5) and d2>- f ( x )  only under the assumption of E-proximally regular. 
The next result is taken from Eberhard and Nyblom (1998). 
Lemma 4.4 Let f be locally Lipschitz in a neighbourhood of 5. Then f is E - 
proximally regular at 5 if and only i f  for every E > 0 there exists a c, > 0 such 
that for each z E Vd$, f (5) (with Z := { ~ t  
I E > 0)) there exists a cp E d& f (Z) 
such that Vcp(5) = z and V2cp(5) 2 -c,I. 
Indeed prox-regular functions are locally E-proximally regular.

Theorem 4.1 Suppose the function f is prox-regular at 5 for fi with respect 
to q and r ,  where fi E df (5). Then f is locally e- proximally regular for all x 
with llx - 511 < q and If (x) - f (%)I < q and all p E dp f (x) with lip - fill < q. 
Proof We sketch the proof leaving the details to the reader. First note that 
when f is prox-regular at 5 it is also locally prox-regular and so is f (.)+ell. -XI[. 
The addition of ell - -XI[ 
will only help to ensure that T, the f attentive y 
localization of d(f (.) + ell . -xIl)(x) (see Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996) or 
Rockafellar and Wets (1998) for definitions), will have T + r I  monotone (use 
Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996) Theorem 3.2 and subdifferential calculus on the 
sum). In addition note that an f attentive q-neighbourhood of 5 is contained 
in an f (.) + ell . -xll attentive (q + eq)-neighbourhood of 5. Thus in an f 
attentive neighbourhood (that is, llx - 511 < q and 11 f (x) - f (5)II < q) of Z we 
have d(f ( a )  + ell -xll)(x) = dp(f (.) + ell - -xII)(x) and so 
This implies Vd& f (x) = 8; f (x) is closed. Hence f is locally e- proximally 
regular.

GENERALIZED CONVEXITY AND SUBJETS 
As we have shown, the derivative information supplied by cp E dcz f(5) is 
closely related to proximal subdifferentials and subjets. We pursue this ap- 
proach further here in order to study the graphical derivative of the proximal 
subdifferential. For the rest of this section let

vex and conic (using the usual operations scalar multiplication and addition of

Theorem 5.1 Suppose that f is @-convex and proper and @ is a convex conic 
subset of mappings from X to E. Then for any v : X H R with +(v(x+t(.)) - 
v(x)) E @ and cp E d~ f (x) we have 
As a consequence the following are equivalent: 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES

Proof We apply the Fenchel equality using the facts that @ is a convex conic 
subset and the evaluation mapping $ H x($) := $(x) is linear for II, E

f (x, t, cp, h)), where $(h) := $(v(x + th) - v(x)). On using f C ( c p )  + f (x) =

= ($) (f'(cp + tv) - fC(cp) - t ( I ( P +  tv) - x(cp)

Thus we have $(v(x + t(.)) - v(x)) E d@ (;A2 f (x, t, cp, .)) (h) if and only if

Substituting f ' ( c p )  + f (x) = cp(x) again and cancelling gives

($) (fc(cp+tv) + f ( x  + th) - cp(x+ th)) -

which is equivalent to fC(cp + tv) + f ( x  + th) = (cp + tv) ( x  + th) or cp + tv E

Indeed in this case there exists a 6 > 0 such that for all w E &(w) and p < 6

The first two are when either f:(x,

Vp(x), h+ p,w,) 
for n sufficiently large or f:(x, 
Vv(x), h + p,w,) 
= f!(x, 
Vp(x), -(h + p,w,)) 
for all n sufficiently large. With either we have via the finiteness of (5.8) that 
In the former case (5.6) holds for all n. In the latter, after renaming h as 
-h and w as -w, (5.6) then holds for n sufficiently large. The third subcase 
is when fr(x, Vp(x), h + p,w,) 
= f!(x,

infinitely often. 
We may reduce this to (5.6) on taking a subsequence along which a positive 
sign is always chosen. 
The only case remaining occurs when the limit infimum is not finite in which 
case any arbitrarily chosen sequence will attain the limit infimum. Thus we may 
assume that the limit infimum in (5.5) is attained by a subsequence along which 
(5.6) holds for all n. 
Now consider p, I 0 and w, - w achieving the limit infimum 
When this is infinite we have (5.10) holding trivially, since (5.4) implies the 
quotient in (5.9) is bounded below by (2V2p(x), wwt). Finiteness of the limit 
implies finiteness of the limit (5.5). Arguing as before we may once again 
assume that (5.6) holds along this sequence. Then when Vv(x) = 0 we have

SUBJET, CONTINGENT CONE INCLUSIONS 
This section explores the relationship between subjets and coderivatives. This 
is achieved by first obtaining results relating the subjet and the contingent 
graphical derivative and then appealing to the results of Rockafellar et al. 
(1997). This will allow us to explore the connection between the symmetric 
operators used in subjets and the symmetry notions introduced in Rockafellar 
et al. (1997) for coderivatives. We find once again that the crucial operators 
are those exposed by rank-one supports. In Dolecki et al. (1978) it was shown 
that a necessary and sufficient condition for a function f : IRn H to be 
@-convex (for 
C @ G C2(IRn)) is for f to be lower semi-continuous and 
minorized by at least one element of @ (that is, G2-bounded or alternatively 
prox-bounded) . 
Recall that a function f belongs to C1>l(1Rn) 
when its gradient exists every- 
where and the gradient itself is a locally Lipschitz function. 
Proposition 6.1 Suppose that f : IRn H ii? 
is @-convex with @2 C @ C 
c2 
(IRn) and cp E da f ( x )  . Suppose v2cp(x) E E(d2>- 
f (x, Vcp(x)), h) and choose 
h such that f!(x, Vcp(x), h) = min{ fT(x, Vcp(x), h), f;(x, Vcp(x), -h)). Then 
there exist sequences {t,) 1 0 and {h,) -+ h such that for all y

Lemma 4.1. If in addition we assume that f is locally Lipschitz and v may be 
chosen so that it is strictly differentiable at x, which may be achieved i f  f is

along with (6.1). Define g(y) := ~ ( t y ) l l y 1 1 ~  
and note that v(x+ty) = v(x)-tg(~). 
When f is C1*l we have f twice differentiable almost everywhere with 
Ilv2 f ( x  + ty)ll I L, where L is the Lipschitz constant of V f .  Thus y H 
v(x + ty) is twice differentiable almost everywhere with value V;V(X + t y )  =

Next observe that for fixed t > 0 we have by the chain rule that Vyv(x + t y )  =

To prove (6.4) consider the Clarke subdifferential of the function y H tg(y). As 
1 T(v(x + t y )  - v(x)) = -g(y) we have tg(y) = -(v(x + ty) - v(x)). The chain 
rule implies -tdv(x + th') = d (tg) (h'). As v is strictly differentiable at x, we 
have dv(x + thl) -+ Vv(x) = 0 as t t 
0. Thus 
diam d ( t g )  (h') = tdiam dv(x + th') = o(t) 
for h' in a bounded set. By the Lebourg mean-value Theorem we have

tihn(hn)t) E C2(Rn). Then by (6.5) we have 
for all y E B6,(tnhn). Since the function o(tn) 2 0 the a2-boundedness of 
k is transferred to k(.) + o(tn)ll . -tnhnll and so we may use Corollary 4.1 to 
globalize this inequality and thus obtain $ E acz (k(.) + o(tn)II. -tnhnll)(tnhn).

Corollary 6.1 Suppose f is prox-regular at x with respect to v. Suppose

Proof We may translate the graph of df so that x = 0 and v = V q ~ ( x )

and add an indicator of a neighbourhood of (0,O) to f so that the resultant 
function is bounded below, since f is lower semi-continuous. Next note that 
prox-regularity ensures that locally we have d f (x) = d, f (x). We extend the 
result from functions that are C1>l(Rn) 
to those that are prox-regular. We 
use the results in Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996) and Poliquin et al. (1996) 
to deduce that fx is C1?'(Rn) locally around 5 (see Poliquin and Rockafellar 
(1996) Theorem 4.4) with V f x ( 0 )  = 0. Thus we may apply Proposition 6.1 
and Lemma 6.1 to deduce that for all X > 0 and any hx with (fx)$'(O,

Q 
(fx)','(O,

ity, use Proposition 3.2 again with A = d21- fx(0, 0 )  to establish 
The last inequality follows via direct calculation as follows. From (6.6) we have

Now use (3.5) and a Neumann series (see for example Anderson et al. (1969))

This suggests that {Qw I Q E ~ ( d ' > -

R. T. Rockafellar and D. Zagrodny in Rockafellar et al. (1997) proved the 
following related result (see also Rockafellar and Wets (1998)).

and fy(x, v ,  W )  = f f ( x ,  V ,  w)).

Corollary 6.2 Suppose that f : Rn H 
is prox-regular, subdifferentially 
continuous at 5 for fi E d f  ( 5 )  and proto-differentiable at 5 for fi. Then for all 
w E b ~ ( f , Z , f i ) ,  
we have 
and 
Proof The containment (6.12) follows immediately from Theorem 6.1 and Corol- 
lary 6.1, noting that dpf = d f  locally. The inequality follows from wtQw = 
f:(5, f i ,  W )  = f!(5, f i ,  w) for a11 Q E E(d2*- f (5, 
f i ) ,  w). 
In Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996) and Poliquin et al. (1996) it is observed 
that the proto-differentiability of d f  at (5, 
f i )  implies the second-order epi- 
differentiability of f at (3, c). 
Whenever we have ( h ,  Q h )  E TGraph 
( x ,  p), then by definition for all x* E 
D* V J P f  (2, P ) )  (Y*) we have 
(x*, h )  I 
(y*, Qh) which implies S ( D * ~ ~ ~ ( X , P ) ( ~ * ) ,  
h )  I (Q, h ( ~ * ) ~ ) .  
If d2>- f ( x ,  V v ( x ) )  = { Q }  then we have for all h that 0 I 
(y*Q - x*, h )  and so 
x* = y*Q as one would expect. 
Proposition 6.2 Suppose f is pros-regular at x with respect to v .  Then for 
every w E bD ( f ,  x, v )  we have

fi E d f (%), proto-differentiable at 5 for fi and b1 (a2>- 
f ( x ,  v ) )  is a poly- 
hedral convex set. Then (6.13) holds for all w E b1 (a2>-f ( x , v ) )  with 
f!(x, v ,  w )  = f%, 
v ,  w ) .  

74 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Proof We use (2.1) and (6.7). Hence for w E lRn 
On using the symmetry of Q we have p E D* (8, 
f) (x, 
v)(w), which implies 
( w t ~ ,  
h) 2 (p, 
h) for all Q E E (a2'- 
f (x, 
v), h) 
(6.16) 
for all h E b~(f,x,v). 
Let w E bo(f,x,v). We may use (6.16) with w = h to get wtQw 2 (p,w) 
for all Q E E (a2'- 
f (x, 
v) , w) 
. This implies 
for all p E D* (8, 
f) (x, 
v) (w). If in addition we make the assumption of 3, then 
by Remark 3.1 E(d21- f (x, 
v), w) # 0 for all w E rel-int b1 (a2'- f (x, 
v)) . 
Now consider fij E b1 (a2>- 
f (x, 
v)) \rel-int b1 (a2>- 
f (x, 
v)) with f!(x, v, a) 
= 
f:(x, v, 8). 
Using Corollary 6.1 of Eberhard (2000) we find that 
is a convex function. We wish to take Q, E E(d21- f (x, 
v), w,) with 
w, E re1 -int b1 (a2,- 
f (x, 
v)) 
for all n and such that f 
w, E dom f!(x, v, .); f 
w, -+ f 
6 and for either the 
plus or minus sign we have f:(x, v, f w,) = fr(x, v, f 
w,) -+ fr(x, 
V, fw) = 
f:(x, v, 6). 
We may need to take the minus sign if f!(x, v, 6) 
= f!(x, v, -w) 
= 
ff(x, v, w). 
By relabeling the vectors we can assume without loss of generality 
that we may use w, -+ w .  The existence of such a sequence may be established 
by invoking Theorem 10.2 of Rockafellar (1970) on a simplicia1 convex subset 
S of rel-int dom f!(x, v, .) U {a) C b1 (d23- f (x, 
v)) containing 
as a vertex. 
Also as b1 (a2>- 
f (x, 
v)) is a polyhedral convex set we may contain any sequence 
w, E b1 (a2>- 
f (x, 
v)) with w, -+ tE in such a simplex. The Theorem 10.2 of 
the cited reference states that the convex function fr(x, v, .) + rll . / I 2  is upper 
semi-continuous relative to S. As the function is by construction lower semi- 
continuous on all of S, it must also be continuous at f 
*. It follows that

Sequence (pn, -wn) E (TGrapha, (5, v))', converging to (p, -W), we have 
lim f!(x,v, w,) = fy(x,v,@~) 
= fy(x,v, 6 )  2 (p, W). 
n--tea 
As the graph of D* (8, f )  (x, v )  (.) equals (TGraph 
ap (5, v)) 
O ,  a closed convex 
cone, p may be taken as an arbitrary element of D* ( d p f )  (x,v)(W). Thus 
(6.13) holds for all w E b1 (a2>- 
f (x, v ) )  with f!(x, v, w )  = f:(x, v ,  w). 
Under the assumption of 3 we always have b1 (a2>- 
f (x, v ) )  convex (see Eber- 
hard (2000) Corollary 4.1). This set is actually a polyhedral set when f is "fully 
amenable" (see Rockafellar and Wets (1998) Theorem 13.67). 
Corollary 6.3 Suppose that f : IRn H is prox-regular at 5 for G E d f  (5) 
with respect to E and r and subdifferentially continuous and proto-differentiable 
at 5 for G. Then for all w we have 
fy(z,G, w) = S ( D  ( d f )  (5,G)(w))(w) I S(D* ( d f )  (5,v)(w),w). 
(6.18) 
Proof The first equality in (6.18) follows from an application of Corollary 6.2 
of Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996) that states that for all w we have 
Also without loss of generality we may translate ~ to zero and consider the in- 
equality for the function g(.) := f (.) - (G, .) + $11 . -5112. By the results of Rock- 
afellar and Wets (1998) and Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996)) (see also Corollary 
6.1 of Eberhard (2000)) under the current assumptions h H g y ( ~ , O ,  h) is con- 
vex. Hence (6.19) implies 
where the subgradient dp coincides with d the usual one from convex analy- 
sis. Now use the fact that support function of the convex subdifferential 
d (igN(5, 0, 
a ) )  (w) in the direction w is equal to the one sided radial direc- 
tional derivative (see Rockafellar (1970)) 

76 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
and on removing the translations (using some basic calculus) we obtain the 
equality in (6.18) holding for all w. The final inequality is true for all w as 
shown by R. T. Rockafellar and D. Zagrondny in Rockafellar et al. (1997) and 
stated in Theorem 6.1. 
7 SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR OPTlMALlTY CONDITIONS 
In this section we give a few examples showing that formul~ (6.12) and (6.15) 
can be used to obtain estimates of graphical derivatives and coderivatives. 
These estimates provide a connection between classical optimality concepts 
based on derivatives of smooth functions and those using graphical derivatives. 
Another approach which is successful in achieving this goal is the study of op- 
timality conditions for 
functions (see Yang and Jeyakumar (1992)) and 
for convex composite functions (see Yang (1998)) both of which are particular 
examples of prox-regular functions. 
We shall apply these ideas to a nonsmooth penalization of the Lagrangian 
associated with a standard smoothly constrained mathematical programming 
problem. Indeed we do not have to assume a priori any regularity of the 
constraint set but allow a condition to arise out of the construction of the rank- 
1 exposed facet of the subjet of the penalized Lagrangian. In this way, what 
appears to be a new and in some ways a more refined second-order sufficiency 
condition for a strict local minimum is derived. 
For unconstrained nonsmooth functions the optimality conditions we inves- 
tigate, when using various second-order subdifferential objects, are as follows. 
Definition 7.1 Let f : IRn + R and assume the first-order condition 0 E 
8, f (5) holds. 
The necessary (suficient) condition of the first lcind holds at Z when we have 
fy(Z,O, h) > ( > )O 
for all h # 0 with fL(5, h) 1 0. 
The necessary (suficient) condition of the second lcind holds at Z when we have 
Vh E dom D (8, f )  (Z,O)(.) with h # 0 
3p E D (8, f )  (Z,O)(h) such that (p, h) 2 ( > )0. 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
77 
Definition 7.2 Let f : Rn + 
and assume the first-order condition 0 E 
8 f (5) holds. 
The necessary (suficient) condition of the third lcind holds at 3 when we have 
V h  # 0, p E D* (df) (3,O)(h) such that (p, h) > ( > )O. 
The necessary (suficient) condition of the forth kind holds at 3 when we have 
V h  # 0, Q E E (d2f (3, O), h) we have (Qh, h )  > ( > ) 0. 
We shall say nothing here about conditions of the fourth kind, leaving this 
to a later paper. The conditions of the first kind are easier to study. This was 
first done by Auslender (1984), Studniarski (1986) and later by Ward (1995), 
Ward (1994). Some related results may be found in Eberhard (2000). In this 
context the sufficient optimality condition of the first kind is equivalent to the 
concept of a strict local minimum of order two (see Studniarski (1986) and 
Ward (1995)). 
Definition 7.3 We say 3 E C is a strict local minimizer of order 2 for f 
IRn + ]R if there exist P > 0 and b > 0 such that 
for all x E B6(5). 
As we assume we have extended real-valued functions, constrained problems 
may easily be included via the use of indicator functions. That is, Z is a strict 
local minimizer of order two for the problem inf { f ( x )  1 x E C) if it is also one 
for the function f (x) + bc(x), where bc(x) = +oo when x $ C and bc(x) = 0 
when x E C. 
Remark 7.1 In Eberhard (2000) it is noted that 0 E 8, f (2) and 
f:(5,0, 
h )  = q (a2,- f (3,0)) ( h )  > 0 for all h # 0 with fl(5, h) 5 0 
(7.2) 
is necessary and suficient for a strict local minimizer of order two. Proposition 
3.3 of Ward (1995) states that 5 is strict local minimizer of order two i f  and 
only if 
fl'(3, 0, h )  > 0 for all h # 0 with fL(5, h )  5 0. 
(7.3) 
Clearly (7.2) implies (7.3), since f: (5,O, h )  = min { fy(3,0, h ) ,  fy(3, 0, - h ) )  
and hence implies 5 is a strict local minimizer of order two. For the converse, it 

78 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
is immediate from definitions that when (7.1) holds we have f:(5, 0, h )  2 P > 0 
in all directions h. 
Remark 7.2 I f f  is not pros-regular, then in order to frame a suficient op- 
timality condition in terms of the subjet we need to use a condition postulating 
0 E d f  (3) and the existence of a c > 0 such that when fl(5, h) 1 0 for 
h E b1 (a2'- f (3,0)) , then 3Q E E, (a2>- 
f (5, 0), h )  with (Q, hht) > 0. (7.4) 
Remark 7.3 When 5 is a strict local minimum order two, then by Remark 7.1 
we have the suficient conditions of the first kind holding. Consider the case 
when fl(3, h )  1 0 and fl(3, -h) > 0 with f prox-regular and subdifferentially 
continuous. Now fl(3, -h) > 0 implies the existence of a 6 > 0 such that 
f (5 + t(-h)) - f (3) 2 bt for t small, so we have 
Hence we always have 
Thus f:(5,O, -h) = +m and f:(3,O, h )  = f:(%,O, h). Now invoke Corollary 
6.1 to obtain 
0 < fl'(% 0, h )  L S ( D  ( d f  (%O)(h))(h). 
Thus there exists a p E D (d f )  (5,O)(h) such that (p, h) > 0. This is precisely 
the suficient condition of the second kind. 
The sufficient conditions of the third kind were studied (for the prox-regular 
subdifferentially continuous function) in Poliquin et al. (1998) in association 
with the concept of the tilt stable local minimum. 
Definition 7.4 A point 5 is said to give a tilt local minimum of the function 
f : Rn 
-+ R i f f  (3) is finite and there exists 6 > 0 such that the mapping 
M : v ~ a r g  min { f ( x ) -  f ( 5 ) - ( v , x - 5 ) )  
Ix-qSa 
is single-valued and Lipschitz continuous on some neighbourhood of v = 0 with 
M(0) = 5 .  

COMPARISON O F  SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDER.IVATIVES 
79 
Remark 7.4 In Poliquin et al. (1998) it is shown that if f is prox-regular 
and subdifferentially continuous at 5 for 6 = 0 then a tilt stable local minimum 
exists at 5 i f  and only if the suficient conditions of the third kind hold at x .  
Lemma 7.1 Suppose that f : Rn + 
is prox-regular and subdifferentially 
continuous at x for a = 0 E d f (z), and d f is proto-differentiable at Z for a. 
Then 
In particular { h  / fL(5, h )  5 0 )  > { h  fy(5,O, h )  < + m )  = dom D (8, f )  ( 5 ,  O)(.) 
and 
Proof Using (6.19) there exists a p  E D (8, f )  ( 5 ,  O)(hl) if and only if dp (a f;(z,o, 
.)) (h') f 
0 which is only possible if f!(5, 0, h') < +co. Indeed by Corollary 6.1 of 
Eberhard (2000) (see also the results of Rockafellar and Wets (1998) and 
Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996)) that under the current assumptions h H 
f:(Z,O, h )  + rllh112 = g!(Z,O, h )  (where g(.) := f(.) + 
. -51' 
as in (6.21)) 
is convex and proper (see Rockafellar and Wets (1998) Theorem 13.40). Thus 
-m < f!(x, 0 ,  .) and consequently the directional derivative (6.21) is also never 
equal to -m in any direction. Invoking Theorem 23.3 of Rockafellar (1970) we 
have convex analysis subdifferential d ( i g 7 5 ,  0, .)) ( h )  # 0 and consequently 
8, ($ f y ( x ,  0, .)) (h') # 0. Thus by (6.19) we have h' E dom D (dp f )  ( 5 ,  0)(.) := 
{ h  1 D (8, f )  (5,O)(h) # 0) and (7.5) holding. 
As f:(5, 0, h )  = min { fy(Z,O, h ) ,  f:(Z,O, -h)) < +co if and only of f 
h E 
dom D (ap f )  (5,O) (.) we have (7.6) holding. Finally note that as f!(Z, 0, h') < 
+co implies f!(5, h') 5 0 and we have the relations preceding (7.6) holding. 
The following are immediate from the results thus proved. 
Theorem 7.1 Suppose that f : Rn H 
is prox-regular, subdifferentially con- 
tinuous and possesses a second-order epi-derivative at 3 for 0 € d f ( 5 ) .  
1. The necessary conditions of the second kind implies the necessary condi- 
tions the first kind while the suficient conditions of the first kind hold if 
and only i f  the suficient conditions of the second kind hold. 

80 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
2. The suficient conditions of the first and second kind hold if and only if 
f is strict local minimum of order two. 
3. If f is a tilt stable local minimum, then it is also a strict local minimum 
of order two. 
Proof On applying Corollary 6.3 we have for all w that 
and so 0 I ( < )  fr(f, 0, h) if and only if 0 < (<)S(D (d f )  (5, O)(h))(h). Suppose 
the necessary (sufficient) conditions of the first kind hold. Then when h E 
dom D (df) (Z,O)(.) we have f;(Z, 0, w) < +oo and hence fl(f, 0) 5 0 implying 
0 5 (<) f!(f, 
0, h). The existence of p E D (d f )  (f, 0) (h) with 0 < (p, h) follows 
from (7.7) when 0 < fr(f,O, h). When the necessary condition of the second 
kind hold then there exists a p E D (d f )  (5, 0) (h) with 0 5 (p, h) and (7.7) 
implies 0 5 fr(f,O, h). 
When the necessary (sufficient) conditions of the second kind hold, take h 
such that fl(f, 0) 5 0. Suppose first that f!(Z, 
0, w) < +oo in which case h E 
dom D (df) (f, O)(.). Then (7.7) along with the necessary (sufficient) conditions 
of the second kind imply 0 <(<) f!(f,O, 
h). Otherwise ff(f,O, w) = +oo > 0 
as required in the necessary (sufficient) conditions of the first kind. As the suf- 
ficient conditions of the first kind hold if and only if 5 is a strict local minimum 
order two the sufficient conditions of the second kind are also equivalent to f 
being a strict local minimum order two. 
Finally suppose f is a tilt stable local minimum and hence the sufficient 
conditions of third kind hold at f .  Then (6.11) of Theorem 6.1 implies for all 
h E dom D (d f )  (f,0) 
( a )  and p E D (d f )  (3, 0) (h) that 0 I (<) (p, h) . Thus the 
sufficient conditions of the second kind follow and f is a strict local minimum 
order two. 
Jets do possess a kind of monotonicity property under fairly natural condi- 
tions. Recall that the rank-1 hull of a set of symmetric operators can be much 
larger than its convex hull (see Eberhard et al. (2002)). 
Lemma 7.2 Suppose { fa),,-* is a family of lower semi-continuous functions. 
1. Define f (x) =  sup,,^ f,(x). Let A(x) := {a E A I f,(x) = f (x)). Then

When A(x) is finite the convex hull of the left hand side of (7.8) is con- 
tained in the right hand side of (7.8). 
2. Now suppose in addition that each f ,  E C2(Rn) for a E A = { I , .  . . , m) 
and let 
li (x, h) := lim sup A(xl)

= { a  E A(%) I 3(tn,hn) + (0+,h) with a E A(x+tnhn), Vn). 
Then 
If also p E co {V f,(x) I a E A(x, h ) ) ,  then

3. When {V f,(x) I a E x(x, h ) )  are linearly independent we have R(x, h,p) =

Proof The first containment for f ( x )  = SUP,,=A f,(x) follows from definitions

and so a E A(x). Observe that in this case, if f, E C2 (lRn) and A is finite, then 
f is locally Lipschitz, prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous (see Exam- 
ple 2.9 of Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996)). Also f is regular (see Rockafellar 
(1982) regarding lower C2 functions) and semi-smooth (see Mifflin (1977) re- 
garding suprema of semi-smooth functions). Hence by the results of Spingarn 
(1981) we must have df submonotone and hence directionally continuous in 
the sense that if (t,, h,) + (O+, h) and pn E d f (x + tnhn) with pn -+ p, then 
In particular, if a E A(x, h) then 3(tn, h,) + (O+, h) such that V f, (x+tnhn) E 
d f (x + tn h,). This implies 
and so a E A(x,h). If p E co { ~ f , ( x )  1 a E i(x,h)), then for any A E

and the 
existence of (t,, h,) + (O+, h) such that A, = 0 for all a $ A(x + tnhn), for n 
sufficiently large. Summing across the second-order Taylor expansion of each 
f, for a E i ( x ,  h) yields

where o (t:) = CaEA(x,h)

In order for Q E E (a2,- f ( x ) )  (h) we require (Q, hht) = f:(fi,p, h). By stan- 
dard arguments (see Example 13.16 of Rockafellar and Wets (1998)) one may 
show that 
whenever h is a direction such that p E co {Vf,(x) I a E A(x, h)), as is the 
case here. If p E co {V f ,  ( x )  I a E A(x, -h)), then as (7.12) holds for h and 
-h we have f!(Z, p, h) = f!(Z, p, -h) (due to the symmetry of the Hessians) 
and so f;(fi,p, h) = f:(Z,p, h). Otherwise by the Clarke regularity of f we 
have (p, -h) < fO(x, -h) = fL(x, -h) , implying f!(x,p, -h) = +oo and once 
again f!(fi,p, h) = ff(%,p, h). By (7.8), (7.12) and the fact that d2>-

Now suppose p E co {V f,(x) 
1 a E A(x, h)). It is clear that n(x, h,p) C 
O(x, h,p). By the linear independence of {Vfx(x) I a E x(x, h)) there exists 
a unique X E O(x, h,p) such that p = CaEA(x,h) 
X,Vf,(x). 
Thus O(x, h,p) = 
{A) forcing equality. 
Remark 7.5 If f, E C2 (Rn) and A is finite, then f is locally Lipschitz, prox- 
regular and subdiflerentially continuous (see Example 2.9 of Poliquin and Rock- 
afellar (1996) and we have 
(see, exercise 8.31 of Rockafellar and Wets (1998)). In particular, when 0 E 
af (x) and 0 = max{(Vf,(x), h) I i E A(x)) this implies 
and so there exists X such that 
0 = x hiVfi(~) for some 
Xi = 1 with Xi 2 0.

Corollary 7.1 Let f, E C2(Rn) for each a E A = (1,. . . , m) and f = 
rnax,~n f, as in Lemma 7.2 part 2. Then 
Proof By Example 2.9 of Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996) and the discussion 
of Rockafellar and Wets (1998), we have all the assumptions of Corollary 6.2 
holding. 
Consider a standard non-linear programming problem 
We consider a modified Lagrangian penalty which is studied in Andromonov 
(2001) (but in greater generality) and is given by 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
85 
This can be viewed as a combination of penalty and Lagrangian methods. We 
posit the following assumptions: 
A1 all fi are continuous for all i = 0,. . . , m; 
A2 fo is positive on the feasible set 3 n X ,  where 
3 : =  {x I fi(x) 5 0  for i =  1, ..., m ) n X  
(this can easily be arranged via a reformulation); 
A3 all the constraints fi are bounded below on Rn (once again this can easily 
be arranged via a reformulation). 
Then it can be shown (see Andromonov (2001), Chapter 5, but in greater 
generality) that the following are all true (note the absence of regularity as- 
sumptions). 
1. Suppose (3, d) E X x RI;. is a saddle point of L(x, d), fi(Z) I: 0 for all 
i = 1 ,..., m and difi(%) = 0 for all i = 1 ,..., m. Then (3,d) is also a 
saddle point of the function U(x, d, f )  for any fixed value of the penalty 
parameters F, that is, for all x E X and d E R"+ := {d I di > 0) we have 
2. We have f * > SUPdE~;l 
infXEx U(x, d, 7). 
Proof (Provided for completeness.) Let x, 
E 3 f l  X be a minimizing 
sequence i.e. fo(xn) -+ f*. Then fi(x,) < 0 for all i and n and as 
d E R1;1 we have 
di fi(xn) 5 0 so fo (x,) 2 L(x,, d). Next note that 
inf U(X, d,F) l U(xn, d, F).

(7.16) 
If L(xn, d) I 0, then U(x,, d, F) I 0 I fo(x,) (since xn E 3 fl 
X and fo 
is positive there). Otherwise 
In both cases we have on combining with (7.16) that

for all n and so inf,,~ U(x, d, 7) 5 f * for all d E ]RT 
3. Under the assumption that (for any e > 0) 
is upper semi-continuous for e J, 0 , there exists 7 sufficiently large such 
that f * - E 5 SUPdE~; inf+€x U(x, d, 7). 
4. If (5, z) E X x R?+? 
is a saddle point (as given in (7.15)), then 5 is an 
optimal solution for the problem (7.14). 
Proof (Provided for completeness.) First we show that 5 is feasible. As 
we have a saddle point, it follows that for all d E IRT we have 
If there is a k such that fk(Z) > 0, we simply let dk -+ cm with di = 0 
for i # k to obtain a contradiction. Thus 5 E 3 n X. Next let d = 0 to 
obtain f * > fo (5) and so that 5 is optimal for (7.14). 
5. From the work of Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996), we know that as 
( x d )  = goF(x) 
then for any fixed (d, r) we have x H U(x, d, r) prox-regular and subdiffer- 
entially continuous (see Example 2.9 of Poliquin and Rockafellar (1996)) 
and as observed before also Clarke regular (see (Rockafellar and Wets 
(1998))), semi-smooth (see (Mifflin (1977))) and hence submonotone and 
directionally upper semi-continuous (see Spingarn (1981) and Rockafellar 
(1982)). It is a very well-behaved function indeed. We now derive the 
necessary optimality condition associated with this Lagrangian penalty 
method. 
Theorem 7.2 Suppose that all fi E C2(Etn) for i = 0,. . . , m and fo is bounded 
below on the feasible set 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
87 
Let A(5) := {i I fi(5) = 0 )  be the active set at Z and 
Then the following are suficient conditions for a strict minimum of order 
two at 5 for the problem (7.14) with X = lRn. Suppose there exists d E IR; 
satisfying: 
1. f i ( Z )  5 O for all i = 1,. . . ,m and difi(Z) = 0 for all i = 1,. . . ,m; 
2. 0 E co ({V,L(5, d)} u { V ,  fi(5) I i E A(5))); 
3. for each h such that 0 = sup { ( ~ , L ( 5 , d ) ,  
h), {(Vxfi(5), 
h) 1 i E A(5))) 
we have that 
there exists ri > 0 for i = 1,. . . , m such that A(%, h) = &(5, h), where 
A". (5,

:= { i  E A(5) I 3(tn, h,) + (o+, h) such that

0 = X0VxL(5,d)+ C XiVfi(5) and

In particular this implies 0 E co ( { V ,  L(Z, 2)) U {riV, fi(5) I i E A(%, h ) ) )  . To

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
A similar calculation shows that the condition (2) implies 
0 E co ({vXL(5,d)} 
U {riV, fi(5) I i E A(5))) for any (rl, . . . , r,) > 0. 
Proof (Theorem 7.2). Since fo is bounded below on 3 by adding a sufficiently 
large constant to fo we may assume without loss of generality that fo is positive 
on F. Consider the localized problem 
for X = Bs(5) for some 6 > 0 yet to be specified. We observe that as fi E 
C2(lRn) for i = 0,. . . , m  these are all bounded below for 6 > 0 sufficiently 
small. Define U(x,d,F) = max{L(x,d),Fl fi(x), . . . ,Fmfm(x)} and note that 
~ ( 5 ,  
d, 7) = f0(5). 
Observe that as & fi(5) = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , m ,  we have L(z, d) = f0(5) 2 0. 
Now suppose that contrary to our assertion that 5 is not a minimum of fo in 
B6(5) for any 6 > 0. Then for any F E IRY we have U(5, d; F )  = L(5,d) = 
fo(5) > 0 and there exists x' E F n B6(5) such that 0 5 fo(xl) < fo(5). This 
implies 
since Cz1 
I& fi(xl) 5 0 for any x' E 3. Now as all Fi fi(xl) 5 0 for all x' E F 
and any F 2 0, when L(xl, d) > 0 we have 
When L(xl, d) 5 0 we have 
In both cases we have, for 6 > 0, an x1 E Bd(5) n 3  such that U(xl, d, F )  < 
U(5,d;F). If this is true for all 6 > 0, then there exists xn +h 5 such that 
fo(xn) < fo(5) and 
~ ' ( 5 ,  
d; r, h) 5 0, which implies L'_(z, d; h) 5 0 
since ~ ( x , ,  
d; F )  = L(x,, d) for large n since fo(5) > 0. 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
89 
Now consider the function 
for which ~ ( 5 ,  
d; r )  = fo(Z) and the maximum is attained for the indices A(5)U 
(0). By assumption 2. we have 0 E d ~ ( x ,  
d; r )  and so 
For i E A(%) we have fi(Z) = 0 and so rifi(z,) 5 ri fi(5) = 0 implying 
(ofi(%), 
h) 5 0. As L'_(Z, d, h) 5 0 we have the supremum in (7.21) equal to 
zero. Thus we may invoke 3. to obtain the existence of a X 2 0, xi X i  = 1 with 
X i  = 0 if i $ A(Z, h) U (0) such that 0 = XoVL(Z,J) + CiEh(z,h) 
XiriVi f (2). 
By (7.13) we have for any such choice of X that 
Thus on choosing X as given in (7.19) we have 
O X ,

 + 1 ( Q ,  ( 
- ' ) ( xn ' ) t )  x n  - 
~ 1 1 '  
I n  -

115, - 
x I I  
This implies by (7.19) that for n sufficiently large and some c > 0 we have 
but since we assumed fo(xn) < fo(5) with x, E 3 we have ~ ( x , ,  
d, r )  = fo(Z) 
contradicting c > 0. Thus 5 is at least a local minimum. 
Let us now fix 6 > 0 sufficiently small so that Z is a local minimum of fo 
on Ba(Z). Let us now redefine the objective to be fo - f: 2 0 and henceforth 
will assume fo 2 0 on the feasible set 3 n Ba(Z). This translation does not 
change any the form of the optimality conditions. As fo(3) = f; = 0 we have 
for all r > 0 that U(Z,z,r) = 0. We now proceed to show that 5 is a strict 
local minimum order two. Note that for any d E IRI;" we have 
since Czl di fi(5) 5 0 = Czl & fi(5) as fi(5) 5 0 for all i = 1,. . . ,m. Thus 
to verify that 5 is indeed a strict local minimum order two for (7.20) we need 

90 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
only consider if it is also one for x H U(x, d, F )  on BJ(3) for some 6 > 0. Indeed 
if 3 is a strict local minimum order two for x ++ U(x, d, F) on B J ( ~ )  
then for all 
XI E 3 n  BJ(E) we have U(xl,d,F) = m a x { ~ ( x ~ , d ) , F ~ f ~ ( x ~ ) , .  
..,.~',f,(x')) = 
L(xl, d) 5 fo(xl). On recalling that fo (3) = U(3, d, r) = 0, we have thus that 
and 3 is also a strict local minimum order two for the problem (7.14). 
Next note that the first-order condition for this amounts to 
We now use sufficient conditions of the first kind in the form of (7.4). We need 
to show that for all h with U'(3, d;F, h) 5 0 and h E b1 (a2>-~(3,d,F, 
0)), 
for some E > 0 we have the existence of a Q E E, ( a 2 ? - ~ ( 3 ,  
d, F,O), h) with 
0 < (Q, hht). As (7.22) holds we have U'(3, d, F, h) > 0 and hence we need to 
consider only those h such that U'(3, d; 7, h) = 0 or 
This means that 0 E co {(v,L(~, 4, {riVx fi(3) I i E A(%, h)}), so we need 
to consider all (Ao, XI,. . . ,A,) 
> 0 with Xi = 0 if i $ A(%, h) such that 
Xiri + Xo = 1 and 
We are at liberty to assume that X satisfies (7.19). We now use (7.10) 
for the function x H U-l(~,d;r) := max{Flfl(x), ... ,Lf,(x)}. 
Let pi := 
/ 
\ 
Note that as A(5, h) = A,(?, h), we have by (7.13) that 
Since U(3,d;F) = L(3,d) = 0 and U(3,d;F) = max{L(lc,d),U-1(3,d,r)), 
we may apply (7.8) to obtain for our given Xo E (0,l) such that 

COMPARISON OF SOME SECOND-ORDER SUBDERIVATIVES 
91 
As 1 - Xo = &h(z,h) 
X i ,  we have by (7.23) that XOVL(E, 
d) + (1 - Xo) p-1 = 0 
and hence 
with Q' satisfying (7.19), that is, (Q', hht) > 0. When h E b1 (a2>-U(Z, d; r, o)), 
there always exists a Q E (Q' + P ( n ) )  n E, (a2'-U(3, d; r, 0), h) # 0 such that 
(7.19) holds and so we have (Q, hht) > 0, the desired conclusion follows from 
(7.4). 
Remark 7.7 The standard second-order suficiency conditions correspond to 
the case when V L ( P ,  d) = 0 and so 0 E A(3, h )  for all h. If we assume also 
that ( v 2 L ( Z ,  d)hht) > 0 for all h satisfying ( V L ( Z ,  d), h )  = 0, we find that 
(7.18) is automatically satisfied. Assumption (7.17) corresponds to a kind of 
well-posedness condition which replaces the usual regularity at 5. The corre- 
spondence between these two conditions is a topic of current research. 
8 APPENDIX 
In this appendix we provide the proof of Lemma 4.1. Let O be a class of 
functions from R+ to IR and define Jz(O, Z) to be the class 
{cp E C2 (IFtn) I there exists (a, p, Q )  E IFtn+' 
x S(n) and r E O such that 
Lemma 4.1 claims that it is sufficient to consider only the class J z ( 0 ,  Z) gen- 
erated by 
which we denote by J2(Z). 
In Penot (1994/1), the subjet is defined via a notion equivalent to taking 
O := { r  : R+ H R I limtlo r ( t )  = 0). Penot shows that in finite dimensions 
that this amounts to demanding 

92 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
On reflection one can see that this corresponds to the second-order char- 
acterization of subjets as provided in the first-order case by Proposition 1.2 
(page 341) in Deville et al. (1993). We extract and extend to the second-order 
level the relevant parts of this argument in the proof of Lemma 4.1. 
Proof [Lemma 4.11 The only problem with w in (4.1) is that it is not neces- 
sarily C2(Rn). AS a C2(lRn) bump function exists, the construction found in 
Lemma 1.3 of Deville et al. (1993) (page 340) leads to a function d : Rn H lR+, 
where 
00 
d(x) := - 
and h(x) = x b(nx). 
h(x) 
n=O 
Here b : lRn H R is a C2(Rn) bump function such that 0 5 b 5 1 on R n ,  
b(0) = 1 and b(x) = 0 for all llxll 2 1. Since 11 . [ I 2  is C2(Rn) by any one of a 
standard set of constructions, we may choose here b(x) = R(ll~1)~) 
(for some 
R : R+ H lR+) for a C2(R) bump function on IR. Thus we may assume that b 
is of the form b(x) = D(11x11) for some function D defined on the positive reals. 
The function d possess all the properties announced in Lemma 1.3 of Deville 
et al. (1993) as well as being C2(Rn) on Rn (note that h(x) 2 1). To see this, 
observe that the sum is locally finite on lRn and so 
is well-defined as CrO=o 
b(nx) 2 1. Without loss of generality we may assume 
that w(-) 2 0. Now arguing as in Proposition 1.2 of Deville et al. (1993) (page 
341) we define 
p(t) := inf{u(h) I llhll 5 t) where u(h) := sup{-w(llhll)llhl12, -1). 
Then p is nonincreasing, p(0) = 0 and so p 5 0 and

Continuing in a parallel fashion to Deville et al. (1993) Proposition 1.2 we

As in the proof of Proposition 1.2 of Deville et al. (1993) (page 342) we have 
Thus we have 
As pl is continuous, p3 is C2-smooth on (0, +m). Put $(x) := p3(d(x)) and 
$(0) = 0. This function is clearly Fr6chet differentiable on lRn \{O), as d(x) # 0 
for x # 0. Since p is nonincreasing, it follows that each pi, i = 1,2,3 are non- 
increasing. Moreover as ( u  - $)(0) = 0 and llxll I d(x) for 11x11 L 1, we have 
and so u - $ has a local minimum at 0. Using (4.1), we find that in some 
neighbourhood of 5 we have 
It remains only to show that $ is twice F'r6chet differentiable at 0. via direct 
calculation we have for x E lRn \{O) that 
V$(h) = p;(d(x))Vd(x) and 
v2$(h) = p$(d(x)) ( ~ d ( x ) ~ d ( x ) ~ )

(8.4) 
By (8.3), p$(t) -+ 0 along with p!(t) -+ 0 as t --t 0. Since d(x) is Lipschitz 
continuous, we have d(x) -+ 0 as llxll -+ 0. In the proof of Proposition 1.2 of 
Deville et al. (1993) it is shown that IlV$(x)II -+ 0 as x -+ 0 and SO we need 
only show 1 1  V2$(x) 
1 1  -+ 0 as x -+ 0. To do this we need estimates on V 2 d ( x )  for 
such x. From Proposition 1.2 of Deville et al. (1993) we know that h(x) < &

for all small x # 0 (that is, & = O(11x11). Letting M be a global bound for

the unit ball that

Thus 
as x + 0. From (8.4) and limt,0 9

and since llxll 5 d(x) 5 KIIxll for 11x11 5 1, it follows that ~;(d(x)) = o(llxll). 
Hence since p$(d(x)) + 0 and Vd(x) is bounded as x -+ 0 we have 
By the mean-value theorem applied initially to the function $ we find V$(O) 
which exists and is zero at the origin (see the proof of Proposition 1.2 of Deville 
et al. (1993)). Next we apply the mean-value theorem to the first derivative 
V$(x) to deduce that v2$(0) = 0 exists and v2$ is continuous at 0. That is, 
for some yt E (0, I), we have 
as t -+ 0 and h -+ 0. Thus $ is twice Frhchet differentiable at 0 with IJ+(Z) = 
(0,O). Finally we note the following. As d is C2(Rn) it is locally Lipschitz and

so Lipschitz on the (compact) unit ball. Since d(x) = 0 outside the unit ball, d 
is globally Lipschitz. Thus 
where K is the global Lipschitz constant of d. Putting r(t) := --

and r(0) = 0, we derive '(h) = - r(llhll)llhl12 is as required.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce generalized augmented Lagrangian by 
relaxing the convexity assumption on the usual augmenting function. Appli- 
cations are given to establish strong duality and exact peanlty representation 
for the problem of minizing an extended real valued function. More specifi- 
cally, a strong duality result based on the generalized augmented Lagrangian is 
established, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact penalty rep- 
resentation in the framework of generalized augmented Lagrangian is obatined. 
Key words: Extended real-valued function, generalized augmented Lagrangian, 
duality, exact penalty representation.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
It is well-known that for nonconvex optimization problems, a nonzero dual- 
ity gap may exist when using ordinary Lagrangian. In order to overcome 
this drawback, augmented Lagrangians were introduced in, e.g., Rockafellar 
(1974); Rockafellar (1993) for constrained optimization problems. Recently in 
Rockafellar, et a1 (1998) a general augmented Lagrangian was introduced where 
the augmenting function is assumed to be convex and, under mild conditions, a 
zero duality gap and a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact penaliza- 
tion were established. Most recently, there is an increasing interest in the use of 
"lower order" penalty penalty functions Luo et a1 (1996); Luo, et a1 (2000); Pang 
(1997); Robinov, et a1 (1999). A special feature of these penalty functions is 
that they are generally neither convex composite functions nor locally Lipschitz 
functions. However, the conditions to guarantee the exact penalty property of 
these "lower order" functions are weaker than those required by the usual l1 
penalty function. 
In this paper, we will introduce a generalized augmented Lagrangian for a 
primal problem of minimizing an extended real-valued function without the con- 
vexity requirement on the augmenting function. This generalized augmented 
Lagrangian includes the lower order penalty function in Luo et a1 (1996) as 
a special case. This relaxation also allows us to derive strong duality results 
and exact penalty representation results under weaker conditions than those of 
Rockafellar, et a1 (1998). More detailed study of this generalized augmented 
Lagrangian can be found in Huang et a1 (2003). 
The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we introduce a gen- 
eralized augmented Lagrangian. In section 3, we address the issue of strong 
duality. Section 4 is devoted to exact penalization.

GENERALIZED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN 
In this section, we introduce some concepts and obtain some basic properties 
of augmented Lagrangians. 
Let R = R U{+oo, -m) and cp : Rn + R be an extended real-valued func- 
tion. Consider the primal problem 
inf cp(x). 
zeRn 

GENERALIZED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN 
103 
A function f : Rn x Rm -+ R is said to be a dualizing parameterization function 
for cp if cp(x) = f ( x ,  0 )  , 'v'x E Rn . 
Remark 2.1 A standard constrained nonlinear program can be written as 
where X c Rn is a nonempty and closed set, f ,  gj : X - R1, j = 1, . . . , ml 
are lsc and gj : X -+ R1, j = ml + 1, . , m are continuous. 
It is clear that (CP) is equivalent to the following unconstrained optimization 
problem 
where 
if x E x o ,  
otherwise, 
So considering the model (2.1) provides a unified approach to the usual con- 
strained and unconstrained optimization problems. 
A simple way to define the dualizing parametrization function for (CP) is: 
f ( x ,  u) = { y; if x E Xu, 
otherwise, 
where 
I n  the sequel, we will use this dualizing parametrization function for (CP). 
Definition 2.1 (Rockafellar, et a1 (1998)). (i) Let X C Rn be a closed subset 
and f : X -+ R be an extended real-valued function. The function f is said 
to be level-bounded on X iJ for any a  E R, the set { x  E X : f ( x )  1 a )  is 
bounded. 
(ii) A function F : Rn x Rm - R with value F ( x , u )  is said to be level- 
bounded in x locally uniform in u if, for each ii E Rm and o E R, there 
exists a neighborhood U(ii) of ii along with a bounded set D C Rn, such that 
{ x  E Rn : F ( x ,  u) 1 
a )  C D for any u E U(ii). 

104 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Definition 2.2 A function a : Rm + R+ U{+oo) is said to be a generalized 
augmenting function i f  it is proper, lower semicontinuous (kc, for short), level- 
bounded on Rm, argminva(y) = ( 0 )  and a(0) = 0. 
I t  is worth noting that this definition of generalized augmenting function 
is different from that of the augmenting function given in Definition 11.55 
o f  Rockafellar, et a1 (1998) in that no convexity requirement is imposed on 
generalized augmenting functions. 
Definition 2.3 Consider the primal problem (2.1). Let f be any dualizing 
parameterization function for cp, and a be a generalized augmenting function. 
(i) The generalized augmented Lagrangian (with parameter r > 0 )  : Rn x 
Rm x (0, +IX) 
+ R is defined by 
[(x, y, r )  = inf{f ( x ,  u) - (y, u) + ra(u) : u E Rm), x E Rn, y E Rm, r > 0, 
where ( y ,  u) denotes the inner product. 
(ii) The generalized augmented Lagrangian dual function is defined by 
(iii) The generalized augmented Lagrangian dual problem is defined as 
Remark 2.2 (i) By Definition 2.2, any augmenting function used in Defin- 
ition 11.55 of Rockafellar, et a1 (1998) is a generalized augmenting function. 
Thus, any augmented Lagrangian defined in Definition 11.55 of Rockafellar, et 
a1 (1998) is also a generalized augmented Lagrangian. 
(ii) If a is an augmenting function in the sense of Rockafellar, et a1 (1998), 
then for any y > 0, a7 is a generalized augmenting function. I n  particular, 
(a) let o(u) = IIuII1, then for any y > 0, a y ( u )  = I I u I I :  
is a generalized 
augmenting function; 
(b) take a(u) = IIuIIm, then ar(u) = I I u I I ~  is a generalized augmenting 
function for any y > 0. 
(c) let a ( u )  = Egl luj 17, where y > 0. Then a ( u )  is a generalized aug- 
menting function. 

GENERALIZED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN 
105 
It is clear that none of these three classes (a), (b) and (c) of generalized 
augmenting functions is convex when y E (0, I ) ,  namely, none of them is an 
augmenting function. 
Remark 2.3 Consider (CP). Let the dualizing parametrization function be as 
in Remark 2.1. It is routine to check (see, e.g., Huang et a1 (2003)) that the 
corresponding augmented Lagrangian is 
I 
+m, 
otherwise, 
where v = (vl,...,vm,) . In particular, if U ( U )  = $IIull;, then the augmented 
Lagrangian and the augmented Lagrangian dual problem are the classical aug- 
mented Lagrangian and the classical augmented Lagrangian dual problem stud- 
ied in Rockafellar (1974); Rockafellar (1993), respectively; i f  a(u) = IIuII:, y > 
0 and ml = 0 (i.e., (CP) does not have inequality constraints), then the aug- 
mented Lagrangian for (CP) is 
and the corresponding augmented Lagrangian dual problem is 
where 
Define the perturbation function by 
p(u) = inf{f ( x ,  u) : x E R"). 
Then p(0) is just the optimal value of the problem (2.1). 
Remark 2.4 Consider (CP). Let the dualizing parametrization function be as 
in Remark 2.1. Then the perturbation function for (CP) is 

106 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
which is the optimal value of the standard perturbed problem of (CP) (see, e.g., 
Clarke (1983); Rosenberg (1984)). Denote by Mcp the optimal value of (CP). 
Then we have p(0) = Mcp. 
The following proposition summarizes some basic properties of the gener- 
alized augmented Lagrangian, which will be useful in the sequel. Its proof is 
elementary and omitted. 
Proposition 2.1 For any dualizing parameterization and any generalized aug- 
menting function, we have 
(i) the generalized augmented Lagrangian i(x, y, r )  is concave, upper semi- 
continuous in (y, r )  and nondecreasing in r. 
(ii) weak duality holds: 
3 
STRONG DUALITY 
The following strong duality result generalizes and improves Theorem 11.59 of 
Rockafellar, et a1 (1998). 
Theorem 3.1 (strong duality). Consider the primal problem (2.1) and its 
generalized augmented Lagrangian dual problem (2.3). Assume that cp is proper, 
and that its dualizing parameterization function f ( x ,  u) is proper, kc, and level- 
bounded in x locally uniform in u. Suppose that there exists ($, F) E Rm x 
(0, +m) such that 
inf{i(x, $, r) : x E Rn) > -m. 
Then zero duality gap holds: 
Proof. By Proposition 2.1, we have

107 
Suppose to the contrary that there exists 6 > 0 such that 
In particular, 
p(0) - 6 > q(g,r) = inf i(x,g,r). 
XEX 
Let 0 < r k  +m. Then, 
Hence, 3uk E Rm such that 
From the assumption of the theorem, we suppose that 
Then, 
f (xk, uk) - (b, uk) + Fu(uk) > -mo,

(3.1) and (3.2) give us 
From the level-boundedness of a, we see that {uk) is bounded. Assume without 
loss of generality that uk -+ .li. Then from (3.3) we deduce 
a(ii) 5 liminf a(uk) 5 0. 
k--++m 
Consequently, ii = 0. Moreover, from (3.1) we see that 
when k is sufficiently large. This combined with the fact that uk -+ 0 and the 
fact that f (x, u) is level-bounded in x locally uniform in u implies that {xk} 

108 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
is bounded. Assume without loss of generality that xk t 5. Taking the lower 
limit in (3.4) as k + +co, we obtain 
This contradicts the definition of p(0). 
Remark 3.1 For the standard constrained optimization problem (CP), let the 
generalized augmented Lagrangian be defined as in Remark 2.3. Further assume 
the following conditions hold: 
(i) 
f ( x )  Jrm*, V X E X ,  
(3.5) 
for some m* E R. 
(22) 
Then all the conditions of Theorem 3.1 hold. It follows that there exists 
no duality gap between (CP) and its generalized augmented Lagrangian dual 
problem.

EXACT PENALTY REPRESENTATION 
In this section, we present exact penalty representation results in the framework 
of generalized augmented Lagrangian. 
Definition 4.1 (exact penalty representation) Consider the problem (2.1). Let 
the generalized augmented Lagrangian i be defined as in Definition 2.3. A vector 
jj E Rm is said to support an exact penalty representation for the problem (2.1) 
if there exists 2 > 0 such that 
and 
argminxcp(x) = argminxi(x, jj, r ) ,  Vr Jr 2. 
The following result can be proved similarly to Theorem 11.61 in Rockafellar, 
et a1 (1998). 

GENERALIZED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN 
109 
Theorem 4.1 In the framework of the generalized augmented Lagrangian de- 
fined in Definition 2.3. The following statements are true: 
(i) If jj supports an exact penalty representation for the problem (2.1), then 
there exist f > 0 and a neighborhood W of 0 E Rm such that 
(ii) The converse of (i) is true i f  
(a) p(0) is finite; 
(b) there exists 7' > 0 such that 
inf{f(x, u) - (Y, u) + F1a(u) : ( x ,  u) E Rn x Rm) > -w; 
(c) there exist T > 0 and N > 0 such that a(u) 2 r11ull when llull > N. 
Proof. Since jj supports an exact penalty representation, there exists f > 0 
such that 
p(0) = inf{i(x, jj, 7 )  : x E R ~ )  
= inf{ J(x, u) - (3, u) +fa(u) : ( x ,  u) E R~ x R ~ ) .  
Consequently, 
implying 
p(0) I p ( u ) - ( j j , u ) + F a ( u ) ,  
V U E  Rm. 
This proves (i). 
It is evident from the proof of Theorem 11.61 in Rockafellar, et a1 (1998) 
that (ii) is true. 
Remark 4.1 In Rockafellar, et a1 (1998), a was assumed to be proper, lsc, 
convex and argmin,u(y) = (0). As noted in Rockafellar, et a1 (1998), a is 
level-coercive. It follows that this assumption implies the existence of T > 0 
and N > 0 satisfying u(u) 2 r11ull when llull 2 N. 
Remark 4.2 Consider (CP) with ml = 0. Suppose that (3.5) holds, Xo # 0, 
and a(u) = IIuII:, 7 > 1. Let the generalized augmented Lagrangian i7(x, y, r )  
for (CP) be given as in Remark 2.3. Then jj supports an exact penalty rep- 
resentation for (CP) in the framework of its augmented Lagrangian &(x, y, r ) ,  
namely, 

110 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
there exists i > 0 such that 
and the solution set of (CP) is the same as that of the problem of minimizing 
Y 
f ( x )  + Cy='=l 
Yjgj ( x )  + r [c,"=~ 
lgj ( x )  I] over x E X whenever r 2 i, 
if and only i f  there exist i' > 0 and a neighborhood W of 0 E Rm such that 
where p is defined as in Remark 2.4. 
For the special case where jj = 0 supports an exact penalty representation 
for the problem (2.1)) we have the following result. 
Theorem 4.2 In the framework of the generalized augmented Lagrangian hulngl 
defined in Definition 2.3. The following statements are true: 
(i) If jj = 0 supports an exact penalty representation, then there exist F > 0 
and a neighborhood W of 0 E Rm such that 
(ii) The converse of (i) is true if 
(a) p(0) is finite; 
(b) there exist F' > 0 and m** E R such that f ( x ,  u) + i1a(u) 2 m**,Vx E 
Rn, u E Rm. 
Proof. (i) follows from Theorem 4.1 (i). We need only to prove (ii). Assume 
that (4.2) holds. 
First we prove (4.1) by contradiction. Suppose by the weak duality that 
there exists 0 < rk -+ +m with 
Then there exist xk E Rn and uk E Rm such that 

GENERALIZED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN 
11 1 
The level-boundedness of a implies that {uk} is bounded. Assume, without 
loss of generality, that uk + ii. It follows from (4.3) that 
a(ii) <_ lim inf a(uk) <_ lim ~ ( 0 )  
- m** = O. 
k++w 
k++w 
Tk -i=' 
Thus ii = 0. From the first inequality in (4.3), we deduce that 
Since uk --+ 0, we conclude that (4.4) contradicts (4.2). As a result, there exists 
F > 7' such that (4.1) holds. Hence, for any x* E argmin,cp(x), we have 
Consequently, x* E argmin,i(x, 0, r). This shows that 
whenever r > F. Now we show that there exists r* > F + 1 > 0 such that 
argmin,i(x, 0, r) 
argmin,cp(x), 
Vr > r* . 
Suppose to the contrary that there exist F + 1 5 r k  1 +oo and xk E 
argmin,i(x, 0, rk) such that xk 6 argmin,cp(x), Vk. Then 
cp(xk) > P(O), 
Vk. 
For each fixed k, by the definition of i(xk, 0, rk), 3{uk>') c Rm with 
f ( ~ ~ ,  + 
+ i(xk, 0, rk) 
as i + +co. Since r k  > F + 1, xk 6 argmin,cp(x), by (4.1), we have 
i(xk, 0, r k )  = p(0). 
From (4.6) and (4.7), we deduce that 
f(xk, ukli) + F ' ~ ( u ~ ' ~ )  
+ (rk - #)a(uk~') + p(0) 
as i --+ +oo. It follows that {(rk - F')a(uk>'))f=Y is bounded since f(xk, uk>') + 
F'a(uk>') > m**. As a is level-bounded, we know that {ukti)ftY is bounded. 
Without loss of generality, assume that ukli -+ iik. Then

Hence,

Again, by the level-boundedness of a ,  we see that {fik} is bounded. Suppose, 
without loss of generality, that fik + fi. Then, from (4.10), we obtain

So we know that iik -+ 0. Note from (4.5) that iik # 0,Vk. Otherwise, suppose 
that 3k* such that fik* = 0. Then from (4.9) we have 
contradicting (4.5). As a result, (4.8) contradicts (4.2). The proof is complete. 
Remark 4.3 Comparing Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, the special case where y = 0 
supports an exact penalty representation requires weaker conditions, i.e., con- 
dition (c) of (ii) in Theorem 4.1 is not needed. 
Remark 4.4 Consider (CP) and its generalized augmented Lagrangian defined 
in Remark 23. Suppose that Xo # 0 and (3.5) holds. Then jj = 0 supports 
an exact penalty representation for (CP) in the framework of its generalized 
augmented Lagrangian i f  and only i f  there exist 7 > 0 and a neighborhood W 
of 0 E R" 
such that 
where p is defined as in Remark 2.4. 
Example 4.1 Consider (CP). Let X* denote the set of optimal solutions of 
(CP). Suppose that Xo # 0 and (3.5) hold. Let the generalized augmenting 
function be a ( u )  = IIuII:,y > 0 and the generalized augmented Lagrangian be 
defined as in Remark 2.3. It is easily computed that 
i(x, 0, r )  = f (x) + r[Cjn"_', 
gT(x) + C,"=,, ,I Isj ( x )

if x E x 
otherwise. 
This is a typical form of 'Yower order" penalty function when 0 < y < 1. 
Remark 4.4 says that the following two statements are equivalent

CONCLUSIONS 
We introduced generalized augmented Lagrangian by relaxing the convexity 
assumption imposed on the ordinary augmenting function. As a result, weaker 
conditions are required to guarantee the strong duality and exact penalization 
results similar to those obtained in Rockafellar, et a1 (1998). This work was 
supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 514l/OlE).

Abstract: In this paper, we study a semi-definite and semi-infinite program- 
ming problem (SDSIP) with equality constraints. We establish that a uniform 
duality between a homogeneous (SDSIP) problem and its Lagrangian-type dual 
problem is equivalent to the closedness condition of certain cone. A corre 
sponding result for a nonhomogeneous (SDSIP) problem is also obtained by 
transforming it into an equivalent homogeneous (SDSIP) problem. 
Key words: Duality, semi-definite program, semi-infinite program.

1 INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARIES 
Let Sn denote the set of real symmetric n x n matrices. By X 2 0, where 
X E Sn, we mean that the matrix X is positive semidefinite. The set K = 
{X E SnlX > 0) is called the positive semidefinite cone. For any S C Sn, cl(S) 
denotes the closure of S in Sn. For the compact set B in a metric space, let 
AB = {y = { y ( t ) ) t ~ ~  
E ~ ~ 1 ( 3 a  
finite set F C B)(W E B\F) y(t) = 0). 
For the set W = {A(t)lt E B), sp(W) denotes the subspace generated by W, 
i.e., 
.P(W) = {C 
Y ( ~ ) A ( ~ ) I v Y  
E As), 
t E B  
The standard inner product on Sn is 
We consider the following semi-definite and semi-infinite linear programming 
problem (SDSIP): 
inf 
C X 
s.t 
A(t) X = b(t), t E B, 
(1.1) 
X 2 0. 
Here B is a compact set in R, C and A(t)(t E B) are all fixed matrices in Sn, 
b(t) E R (t E B) and the unknown variable X also lies in Sn. 
Obviously, (SDSIP) problem includes the semi-definite programming prob- 
lem and the linear semi-infinite programming problem with equality constraints 
as special cases. See Charnes et a1 (1962) and Wolkowicz et a1 (2000). 
For the (SDSIP) problem , we introduce the Lagrangian dual problem (DS- 
DSIP) as follows: 
When the parameter set B is finite, Then, (SDSIP) and (DSDSIP) is a pair 
of primal and dual (SDP). See Vandenberghe and Boyd (1996), Ramana et a1 
(1997) and Wolkowicz et a1 (2000). 

DUALITY FOR SEMI-DEFINITE AND SEMI-INFINITE PROGRAMMING 
117 
Proposition 1.1 Suppose that X and (y, 2 )  are feasible solutions for (SDSIP) 
problem and (DSDSIP) problem, respectively. Then, 
Proof Since (y, Z) is a feasible solution for (DSDSIP), 
Then, we have 
Since X and Z are positive semidefinite matrices, Z X 2 0. It follows that 
Thus, the result holds. 
(SDSIP) problem is said to be consistent if there exists X 
0 such that 
(1.1) holds. It is said to be bounded in value if it is consistent and there 
exists a number z* such that all feasible solutions X E Sn to (SDSIP) satisfy 
C X 2 z*. It is said to unbounded in value if, for each integer n, there exists 
a feasible solution x(") to (SDSIP) with C x ( ~ )  
5 -n. 
Definition 1.1 The system of linear equalities 
yields duality with respect to C E Sn, if exactly one of the following conditions 
holds: 
(i) (SDSIP) is unbounded in value and (DSDSIP) is inconsistent; 
(ii) (DSDSIP) is unbounded in value and (SDSIP) is inconsistent; 
(iii) Both (SDSIP) and (DSDSIP) are inconsistent; 
(iv) Both (SDSIP) and (DSDSIP) are consistent and have the same optimal 
value, and the value is attained in (DSDSIP). 
W e  say that (SDSIP) yields uniform duality if the constraint system (1.3) yields 
duality for every C E Sn. 

118 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
In the paper, we firstly establish that a uniform duality between the ho- 
mogeneous (SDSIP) and its Lagrangian-type dual problem is equivalent to the 
closedness condition of certain cone. With aid of the result, we also obtain a 
corresponding result for nonhomogeneous (SDSIP). 
Detailed study of uniform duality for (SDSIP) problems with inequality con- 
strains can be found in Li et a1 (2002).

UNIFORM DUALITY FOR HOMOGENEOUS (SDSIP) 
We firstly discuss the homogeneous case in (SDSIP): b(t) = 0,V t E B. Then 
(SDSIP) becomes the following problem (SDSIPh): 
inf 
C X 
s.t A(t) X = 0, t E B, 
x k 0, 
and (DSDSIP) becomes the following problem (DSDSIPh): 
sup 0 
Lemma 2.1 The problem (SDSIPh) is unbounded in value if and only if there 
exists X* 2 0 satisfying: 
A(t) X* = 0, t E B 
(2.3) 
and 
C. X* 
< 0. 
(2.4) 
Proof. Suppose that there is X* 
0 such that (2.3) and (2.4) hold. Without 
loss of generality, assume COX* < -1. For each n we have A(~).x(") > 0, t E B 
and COX(") < -n with x(") = nX*. Hence, (SDSIPh) is unbounded in value. 
Conversely, by the unbounded definition, the case holds. This completes the 
proof. 
0 
Remark 2.1 Since X = 0 is a feasible solution of (SDSIPh), (SDSIPh) is 
always consistent. If the optimal value of (SDSIPh) is bounded below, the 
optimal value of (SDSIPh) is zero. Thus, (ii) and (iii) in Definition 1.1 do not 
happen. 

DUALITY FOR SEMI-DEFINITE AND SEMI-INFINITE PROGRAMMING 
119 
Theorem 2.1 (SDSIPh) yields uniform duality if and only if sp(W) + K is a 
closed set. 
Proof. Suppose (SDSIPh) yields uniform duality. Let C E cl(sp(W) + K )  and 
C $! sp(W) + K .  Then, there exists no y E AB and Z > 0 such that 
Thus, (DSDSIPh) is inconsistent. Since (SDSIPh) is consistent, the problem 
(SDSIPh) must be unbounded in value. By Lemma 2.1, there exists X *  2 0 
satisfying (2.3) and (2.4). By (2.3), we have that 
Take any S E sp(W) + K. Then, there exist V E sp(W) and Q E K such that 
Since Q and X *  are positive semidefinite matrices, we have that 
and 
s e x *  2 0 .  
Therefore, we get that 
and 
C e X *  2 0. 
However, it follows from (2.4) that CeX* < 0, which is a contradiction. Hence, 
sp(W) + K is closed. 
Conversely, suppose sp(W) + K is closed. Let C E Sn be arbitrary. Since 
(SDSIPh) is consistent, either (SDSIPh) is unbounded in valued or bounded 
in value. If (SDSIPh) is unbounded in value, by Proposition 1.1, (DSPSIPh) 
is inconsistent. If (SDSIPh) is bounded in value, its value is zero by Lemma 

120 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
2.1. Now we show that clause (iv) of Definition 1.1 holds. If (DSDSIPh) is not 
consistent for C, C @ sp(W) + K = cl(sp(W) + K). By the definitions of sp(W) 
and K ,  we have that sp(W) + K is a closed and convex cone in Sn. Thus, by 
the separation theorem, there exists X* in Sn such that 
Obviously, 
A(t) E sp(W), V t E B. 
Therefore, 
C e X 4 < O a n d A ( t ) e X * = 0 ,  V ~ E B .  
Thus, it is necessary that we prove X *  
0. Take any Q E K and 0 E sp(W). 
We have 
Q @ X 4 2 0 ,  V Q E K .  
(2.5) 
Thus, X* is a positive semidefinite matrix. It completes this proof.

Proposition 2.1 The constraint system 
yields duality for any 
E Sn+l if and only if sP(w) + K is a closed set. 
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.1 and is omitted.

UNIFORM DUALITY FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS (SDSIP) 
We now establish the duality for the nonhomogeneous constraint system (1.1) 
of (SDSIP) by reformulating it as a form of homogeneous system (2.1) and 
applying Proposition 2.1. For any real number d E R, we define: 
0 is zero element in Rn and 2,g E Sn+l. 
Now, we introduce a new semi-definite and semi-infinite programming prob- 
lem (SDSIPl): 
inf C l x 
s.t j ( t )  2 = 0, t E B, 
(3.1) 
X k 0. 

DUALITY FOR SEMI-DEFINITE AND SEMI-INFINITE PROGRAMMING

The Lagrangian dual program (DSDSIPl) of (SDSIPI) is as follows: 
sup 0 
s.t. 
y(t)A(t) + 2 = 6 ,  y E AB, 
(3.2) 
t E B  
2 > 0. 
which is equivalent to the program 
sup 0 
Lemma 3.1 The nonhomogeneous constraint system (1.1) yields duality with 
respect to C E Sn if and only if, for every d E R, the constraint system (3.1) 
yields duality with respect to 6 E Sn+l. 
Proof Suppose that the constraint system (1.1) yields duality with respect to 
C E Sn and let d 6 R. We will show that the constraint system (3.1) yields 
duality with respect to 6. 
Since (SDSIPl) is a homogeneous system, by Remark 2.1, we need only show 
two cases: 
Case one: if its dual problem (DSDSIPl) is consistent, (iv) in Definition 1.1 
holds. 
By homogeneous property of (SDSIPl) problem, we have that the optimal 
value of (DSDSIPl) problem is zero. It follows from Proposition 1.1 that (SD- 
SIP1) problem is bounded in value. By Remark 2.1, we have that (iv) in 
Definition 1.1 holds. 
Case two: if its dual problem (DSDSIPl) is inconsistent, (i) in Definition 
1.1 holds. Namely, (SDSIPl) has a value of -00 with respect to 6. 
Assume that its dual problem (DSDSIPl) is inconsistent. Note that (3.3) 
and (3.5) are the constraint system of (DSDSIP). If (SDSIP) is consistent and 
(3.3) and (3.5) are hold, by hypothesis condition that the constraint system 
(1.1) yields duality with respect to C E Sn, we have 

122 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Thus, it follows from the inconsistency of the dual problem (DSDSIPl) that 
at least one of two conditions holds: (i) the constraint (3.3) does not hold; (ii) 
the constraint (3.3) holds, but the constraint (3.4) does not hold. Namely, 
If (i) holds, then the problem (SDSIP) is unbounded in value by hypothesis. 
Thus, for any number n however large, there exists x(") 2 0 such that 
Set 
and 0 E Rn. 
It follows from x ( ~ )  
that x(") is a positive semidefinite matrix. Thus, we have 
that 
Therefore, (SDSIP1) has value -00. 
If (ii) holds and (SDSIP) is inconsistent, then we have that (SDSIP) is in- 
consistent and (DSDSIP) is consistent. Since (SDSIP) has duality with re- 
spect to C, for any n, there exists a solution y E AB for (DSDSIP) with 
CtEB 
y(t)b(t) > n. Then, the dual problem (DSDSIPl) is consistent for any 
d E R, which contradicts with assumption. 
If (ii) holds and (SDSIP) is consistent, by (3.6), we have 
Therefore, there exists a point X t 
0 with 
and 
Set 

DUALITY FOR SEMI-DEFINITE AND SEMI-INFINITE PROGRAMMING 
123 
Then, 
Thus, by Lemma 2.1, (SDSIPl) has value -00. We have proved the necessity 
of this lemma. 
To prove the sufficiency of the lemma, we suppose that, for all d E R and 
C E Sn, (SDSIP1) yields duality with respect to 6 .  We need to prove that 
(SDSIP) yields duality with respect to C. 
If (SDSIP) is inconsistent, then, there is only zero to solve (SDSIPl). By 
the definition of duality, (DSDSIPl) is consistent for any d E R. Take d = n. 
Thus, there exists y(n) E AB such that 
and 
Therefore, clause (ii) of the Definition 1.1 holds. 
If (SDSIP) is consistent, then there are two cases: 
(a) (SDSIP) is unbounded in value. If (DSDSIP) is consistent, then take any 
feasible solutions X and (y, Z) for (SDSIP) and (DSDSIP), respectively. Thus, 
C o  X 2 20 X + 
y(t)b(t). 
t € B  
Since X and Z are positive semidefinite matrices, Z l X 2 0. It follows that 
which contradicts unboundedness for (SDSIP). Thus, (DSDSIP) is inconsistent. 
(b) (SDSIP) is bounded in value. Let zo = inf{CoX (A(t)*X 2 b(t) , t E B) . 
We first show that (SDSIPl) for d = zo cannot be unbounded in value. 
If (SDSIPl) is unbounded in value, then by Lemma 2.1, there is a solution 
to 
A(t) O X  
= 0, 
t E B, x > 0, 
cox <o. 

124 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Suppose 2 = ( 
x:l 
) , where x E Rn,X* E Sn and X *  2 0. Take 
x = ( ti 
) , where (I E Rn. Obviously, x is positive semidefinite 
xn+l 
and satisfy: 
If x,+l > 0, then we may assume xn+l = 1 by homogeneity, and we have 
which is a contradiction to the definition of d. 
If xn+l = 0, then, we have 
Let Xo be a feasible solution for (SDSIP). Then, for any X 2 0, Xo + AX* is a 
solution of (SDSIP). Thus, we have that Co(Xo+XX*) = C.Xo+XC.X* 
< 20, 
for large X > 0. This is a contradiction to the definition of zo. Then, (SDSIPl) is 
bounded in value for d = zo. Since (SDSIPl) has duality, there exists a solution 
(y, 2) satisfying (3.3) and (3.4). By (3.4), the optimal value of (SDSIP) is equal 
to that of (DSDSIP). So (SDSIP) yields duality with respect to C. 
It follows from Lemma 3.1 that we can get the following corollary. 
Corollary 3.1 (SDSIP) yields uniform duality if and only if, for any d E R 
and C E Sn, the constraint system (3.1) yields duality with respect to 6 E Sn+l. 
Theorem 3.1 (SDSIP) yields uniform duality if and only if sP(w) + K is a 
closed set, where 
w = {A(t) E sn+llt E B), sp(w) = {x 
y(t)A(t)ly E As),

Proof. By Corollary 3.1, (SDSIP) yields uniform duality if and only if, for 
any d E R and C E Sn, the constraint system (3.1) yields duality with respect 
to each

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A huge literature has been devoted to Hamilton-Jacobi equations during the 
last decades and several monographs are devoted to them, partially or entirely 
(Bardi and Capuzzo-Dolcetta (1998), Barles (1994), Clarke et a1 (1998), Evans 
(1998), Lions (1982), Subbotin (1995), Vinter (2000)). The amount of methods 
used to study them is amazing. Here we consider them from the point of 
view of unilateral analysis (nonsmooth analysis, convex analysis and variational 
convergences). 
Given a Banach space X, with dual X* and functions g : X + IRU{+co), 
H : X* -t IRU{+co), the evolution Hamilton-Jacobi equation we study con- 
sists in finding solutions to the system 
du

dt 
(B) 
4x7'3) = g(x) (1.2) 
where u : X x R+ 
--+ 
is the unknown function, and Du (resp. g) denotes 
the derivative of u with respect to its first (resp. second) variable. Note that 
we accept solutions, Hamiltonians and initial value functions taking the values 
+co or being discontinuous. 
In the present paper we survey some questions which occurred to us while 
studying this equation and the papers which were available to us. Needless 
to say that many other questions could be considered. We refer to Alvarez 
et a1 (1999), Barron (1999), Borwein and Zhu (1996), Crandall et a1 (1992), 
Deville (1999), Frankowska (l993), Imbert (lggg), Imbert and Volle (lggg), 
Penot (2000), Penot and Volle (2000) and Volle (1997) for more complete recent 
developments and to the monographs quoted above for classical results and 
references.

THE INTEREST OF CONSIDERING EXTENDED REAL-VALUED 
FUNCTIONS 
The origins of equations (H-J), (B) incite to consider such data. These equa- 
tions arise when, for a given (x, t) E X x IP, with IP the set of positive numbers, 
one considers the Bolza problem: 
(B) find V(x,t) := 

HAMILTON-JACOB1 EQUATIONS 
129 
where W1*l([-t, 01, X) is the set of primitives of integrable functions on [-t, 0] 
with values in X. 
For considering problems in which a target A has to be reached, it can be 
useful to take for g the indicator function LA of the subset A of X given by 
LA(%) = 0 if x E A, +co if x E X\A, SO that the terminal constraint x(0) E A 
is taken into account. 
Classically, one associates to the Lagrangian L an Hamiltonian H via the 
partial conjugacy formula 
or H(x,p) = (L,)*(-p), where L,(v) = L(x,v) and f *  denotes the Fenchel 
conjugate off given by f *(p) := sup{p.x- f (x) : x E X). We observe that, even 
when L is everywhere finite, the function H may take the value +m. Moreover, 
for modeling control problems, L may take infinite values. For instance, in order 
to take into account a differential inclusion 
where E : X Z  X is a multimapping, one may set L(x, .) = iE(,)(.), the indicator 
function of the set E(x). In such a case, H(x, .) is the support function of the 
set E(x); it is finite everywhere iff E(x) is bounded, a condition which is not 
always satisfied. 
Allowing the solutions to take the value +m brings difficulties in defining 
notions of solution and in questions of convergence. When H depends on the 
derivative of u only, one disposes of explicit formulae designed by Hopf, Lax 
and Oleinik: for (x, t) E X x IF' := X x (0, +co) 
U(X, t) : = inf sup (p.(x - Y) + g(y) - ~H(P)), 
(Lax-Oleinik) 
V E X  p E X *  
~ ( x ,  
t) : = sup inf (p. (x - y) + g(y) - tH(p)) 
p e x *  V E X

These formulae can be interpreted with the help of the Legendre-Fenchel

(p.x - g*(p) - tH(p))

and, using the infimal convolution 
given by ( g ~ h )  
(x) := inf{g(x-y)+h(y) : 
YE Y ) ,  
u(x,t) := (gn(tH)*) (x) := inf g(x - y) + (tH)*(y), 
YEX 
(2.2) 
One can extend these functions to X x R by setting u(x, t) = v(x, t) = +co 
for X E X, t < 0, V(X, 0) := (g* + ~domff)*(x), 
U(X, 0) := ( g o  hO) (2) with 
ho being interpreted as L:,,~, 
the support function of dom H. In doing so, 
one gets another interpretation made in several recent contributions (Imbert 
(lggg), Imbert and Volle (lggg), Penot and Volle (2000)), under various degrees 
of generality, starting with the pioneering work of Plazanet Plazanet (1990) 
dealing with the Moreau regularization of convex functions using a convex 
kernel. Setting 
where E := {(p, r) E X* x IR : -r > H(p)) = S(epi H )  and S is the symmetry 
(I), r) 
(P, -TI, one has 
where the conjugates are taken with respect to the pairs (p, r), (x, t) and where 
the infimal convolution is taken with respect to the variable (x, t) (the notation 
is unambiguous inasmuch F and G are defined on X* x IR and X x IR respec- 
tively). In fact, for t E IR+ one has F* (., t) = (tH)* and G* = g* o p p ,  where 
px* is the first projection from X* x IR to X*. 
In order to avoid the trivial case in which v is the constant function -cox, 
we assume that 
domH n domg* # 0, 
(2.5) 
while to avoid the case the Lax solution u is an improper function we assume 
the condition 
domg # 0, 
domH # 0, 
domH* # 0. 
(2.6) 
In Imbert and Volle (1999), Penot (2000) and Penot and Volle (2000) some 
criteria for the coincidence of the Hopf and the Lax solutions are presented and 
some consequences of this coincidence are drawn. In particular, in Penot and 
Volle (2000) we introduced the use of the Attouch-BrBzis type condition 
Z := IR+(domg* - domH) = -2 = cl(Z) 
(2-7)

which ensures that u = v when g and H are closed proper convex functions. 
Simple examples show that, without convexity assumptions, u and v may differ. 
The interchange of inf and sup in the explicit formulae above shows that 
u 2 v. A more precise comparison can be given. Without any assumption, for 
t E IP, one has 
u(-,t) 2 u(.,t)** := ( g ~ ( t H ) * ) * *  
- 
- (g* + tH**)* 2 (g* + tH)* = v(.,t), 
(2.8) 
u** = (F*nG)** = (F** + G*)* 2 (F + G*)* = v. 
(2.9) 
Under the convexity assumption 
H** I domg* = H 1 domg*, 
(2.10) 
which is milder than the condition H** = H, one has a close connection between 
u and v. 
Proposition 2.1 Under assumptions (2.5), (2. lo), one has u(., t)** = v(., t), 
u** = v. If moreover g is convex, then v = a, the lower semicontinuous hull of 
U. 
Proof. Let us prove the second equality of the first assertion, the first one 
being similar and simpler. In view of relation (2.9) it suffices to show that 
(F** + G*) (p, q) = (F + G*) (p, q) for any (p, q) E X x R, or for any (p, q) E 
domg* x R since both sides are +oo when p $ domg*. Now F** is the indicator 
function of the closed convex hull m(E) of E. Since B ( E )  = m(S(epi H)) = 
S(m(epiH) = S(epi H**), for p E domg* we have (F** + G*) (p, q) = g*(p) iff 
(p, q) E W(E) = S(epi H**) iff ( F  + G*) (p, q) = g* (p).

SOLUTIONS I N  T H E  SENSE OF UNILATERAL ANALYSIS 
Defining an appropriate notion of solution is part of the challenge. When 
considering existence and uniqueness of a solution as the crucial question, the 
notion of viscosity solution (or Crandall-Lions solution) is a fine concept. It is 
certainly preferable to the notion of generalized solution in which the derivative 
of u exists a.e. and satisfies equation (H-J). 
Since the initial condition can also be given different interpretations, we 
chose in Penot and Volle (2000) to treat separately equation (H-J) and the 

132 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
initial condition (B). In doing so, one can detect interesting properties of func- 
tions which are good candidates for the equation but do not satisfy the initial 
condition in a classical sense. When a function u satisfies both (H-J) and (B) 
in an appropriate sense, we speak of a solution of the system (H-J)-(B). 
The notion of viscosity solution (Crandall and Lions (1983), Crandall et a1 
(1984)) which yielded existence and uniqueness results, introduced a crucial 
one-sided viewpoint since in this notion, equalities are replaced by inequalities. 
A further turn in the direction of nonsmooth analysis occurred with Barron 
and Jensen (1990), F'rankowska (1987), Fkankowska (1993) (see also Bardi and 
Capuzzo-Dolcetta (1998), Clarke et a1 (1998), Vinter (2000)) in which only 
subdifferentials are involved. We retain this viewpoint here and we admit the 
use of an arbitrary subdifferential. Although this concept is generally restricted 
to some natural conditions, here we adopt a loose definition which encompasses 
all known proposals: a subdifferential is just a triple (X, 3, d) where X is a class 
of Banach spaces, 3(X) is a class of functions on the member X of X and d 
is a mapping from 3 ( X )  x X into the family of subsets of X*, denoted by 
(f, x) H d'f (x), with empty value at (f, x) when If (x)l = oo. The viscosity 
subdifferential of f at x is the set of derivatives at x of functions cp of class C1 
such that f - cp attains its minimum at x. For most results, it suffices to require 
that cp is F'rbchet differentiable at x. This variant coincides with the notion of 
Frkhet subdifferential defined for f E R ~ ,  
x E f -'(R) by 
1 
x* E X * :  liminf -[f(x+u)- 
f(z)-(x*,u)] 2 0

in view of the following simple lemma which shows that there is no misfit 
between the two notions. 
Lemma 3.1 For any Banach space X, the Fre'chet subdifferential o f f  at x E 
dom f coincides with the set of derivatives at x of functions cp which are Fre'chet- 
differentiable at x and such that f -cp attains its minimum at x. If X is reflexive 
(or more generally can be renormed by a norm of class C1 on X\{O)) then the 
Fre'chet subdifferential coincides with the viscosity subdifferential. 
A similar result holds for the Hadamard (or contingent) subdifferential defined 
for f E ITX, x E f-l (R) by

X * E X * : V W E X ,  liminf

when the Frkchet differentiability of cp is replaced with Hadamard differentia- 
bility. 
Definition 3.1 Given a subdifferential a?, a function w : X x R -t 
is a 8'- 
supersolution of (H-J) i f  for any ( x ,  t) E X x IF' and any (p, q) E d'w(x, t) one 
has q + H(p) 2 0. If moreover weak-lim i n f ( , ~ , ~ ) ~ ~ , , ~ + )  
w(xl, t) 2 g(x) for each 
x E X ,  with X endowed with its weak topology, w is said to be a supersolution 
to (H-J)-(B). 
It is called a 8'-subsolution of (H-J) if for ( x ,  t) E X x IP and any (p, q) E 
d?w(x, t) one has q + H(p) I 0. If moreover weak-lim inf(,~,t)-(,,~+) w(xl, t) I 
g(x) for each x E X ,  w is said to be a subsolution to (H-J)-(B). It is a 8'- 
solution of (H- J) i f  it is both a 8'-supersolution and a 8'-subsolution. 
The preceding definition is a natural one from the point of view of nonsmooth 
analysis or unilateral analysis (note that in Bardi and Capuzzo-Dolcetta (1998) 
a solution is called a bilateral solution in view of the relation q + H(p) = 0 
for any (p,q) E d7u(x,t); however, we prefer t o  stress the exclusive use o f  
the subdifferential). The preceding definition has been introduced by Barron 
and Jensen in Barron and Jensen (1990) (along with a lower semicontinuity 
assumption) for the viscosity subdifferential. 
W e  recover a more classical notion in the following definition. 
Definition 3.2 A function u : X x R 
-t jTi: is a Crandall-Lions 8?-subsolution 
if -u is a supersolution of the equation associated with the Hamiltonian p I+ 
-H(-p). It is a Crandall-Lions 8'-solution i f  it is both a 8'-supersolution and 
a Crandall-Lions 8?-subsolution.

VALIDITY OF SOME EXPLICIT FORMULAE 
Another interest of formulas (2.3)-(2.4) lies in the simplicity o f  the proofs of 
existence theorems (see Imbert (1999) and Imbert and Volle (1999)). Here 
we simplify the original approach o f  Penot and Volle (2000). Note that no 
assumption is needed for assertion (a). 
Theorem 4.1 (a) The Hopf solution v is a Hadamard (hence a Re'chet) su- 
persolution of (H- J). 
(b) Under assumptions (2.5), (2. lo), the Hopf solution v is a Hadamard 
solution of (H-J).

Proof. (a) If assumption (2.5) does not hold, one has v I X x P = -coXX' 
and there is nothing to prove. If it holds, given t > 0, x E X and (p, q) E 
dv(x, t), since v is convex, for each s 6 R+, one has

one gets 
The last inequalities show that g*(p) < oo; it follows that q + H(p) 2 0. 
(b) For s > 0, using (2.5), (2.10) to note that g* + sH = g* + sH** is closed, 
proper, convex, one gets 
p.x+q(t-s)-v(x,t) 
2 sup (p.w-(g*+sH)*(w)) 
wEX 
= ( g * + s ~ ) * * ( p )  
= (g* + sH) (P). 
(4.2) 
Since g * ( ~ )  < +co and since s can be arbitrarily large, one obtains -q 2 
H(P). 
In order to get a similar property for the Lax solution, we use a coercivity 
condition: 
(C) 
liminfllxll+oo H*(x)l IIxII > - liminfllxll+oo d x ) l  IIxII . 
Let us recall that an infimal convolution is said to be exact if the infimum is 
attained. Under assumption (C), exactness occurs in (2.2) when X is reflexive 
and g is weakly 1.s.c. 
Theorem 4.2 (a) When (C) holds, the Lax solution u is a Re'chet supersolu- 
tion. 
(b) If the inf-convolution in the definition of u is exact, then u is a Hadamard 
supersolution. 
(c) If g is convex, then u is a Hadamard supersolution. 
(d) If H = H**, then u is a Hadamard subsolution. 
Since the definition of u involves H through H*, the assumption H = H** 
is sensible. 

HAMILTON-JACOB1 EQUATIONS

Proof Since assertions (b)-(d) are proved in Penot and Volle (2000) and else- 
where, we just prove (a). Let (x,t) E X x IP be fixed and let k be given by 
k(w) = g(z - w) + tH*(t-'w). Assumption (C) ensures that k is coercive (this 
fact justifies the observation preceding the statement). Let B be a bounded 
subset of X such that inf k(B) = inf k(X). For each s €10, t[ let us pick z, E B 
such that k(z) < inf k(X) + s2 = u(x, t) + s2. Then, a short computation shows 
that 
U(X - st-'zs,t - S) < u(x,t) - sH*(t-lz,) + s2. 
It follows that for each (p, q) E 8-u(x, t) one can find a function E : lR+ - lR+ 
with limit 0 at 0 such that 
Therefore, dividing by s, and passing to the limit inferior, we obtain

UNIQUENESS AND COMPARISON RESULTS 
Let us turn to this important question which has been at the core of the viscos- 
ity method. There are several methods for such a question: partial differential 
equations techniques (Bardi and Capuzzo-Dolcetta (1998), Barles (1994), Lions 
(1982). ..), invariance and viability for differential inclusions (Subbotin (l995), 
F'rankowska (1993), Plaskacz and Quincampoix (2000), Plaskacz and Quincam- 
poix (2000) ...), nonsmooth analysis results such as the Barron-Jensens strik- 
ing touching theorem (Barron (1999), Barron and Jensen (1990)), the fuzzy 
sum rule (Borwein and Zhu (1996), Deville (1999), El Haddad and Deville 
(1996)), multidirectional mean value inequalities (Imbert (1999), Imbert and 
Volle (1999), Penot and Volle (2000)). Let us note that the last two results are 
almost equivalent and are equivalent in reflexive spaces. 
In order to simplify our presentation of recent uniqueness results arising from 
nonsmooth analysis, we assume in the sequel that X is reflexive and we use the 
F'rbchet subdifferential. In such a case, a fuzzy sum rule is satisfied and mean 
value theorems are available. 
Theorem 5.1 (Penot and Volle (2000) Th. 6.2). For any 1.s.c. Fre'chet sub- 
solution w of (H-J)-(B) one has w < u, the Lax solution. 

136 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
The next corollary has been obtained in Alvarez et a1 (1999) Th. 2.1 under 
the additional assumptions that X is finite dimensional, H is finite everywhere 
and for the subclass of solutions which are 1.s.c. and bounded below by a 
function of linear growth. It is proved in Imbert and Volle (1999) under the 
additional condition that dom H* is open. 
Corollary 5.1 Suppose X is reflexive, g and H are closed proper convex func- 
tions and domg* c dom H. Then the Hopf solution is the greatest 1.s.c. Fre'chet 
subsolution of (H- J)-(B). 
The use of the mean value inequality for a comparison result first appeared 
in Imbert (1999), Imbert and Volle (1999) Theorem 3.3 which assumes that H 
is convex and globally Lipschitzian and that X is a Hilbert space. Let us note 
that in our framework the mean value theorem is equivalent to the fuzzy sum 
rule; the fuzzy sum rule has been used in Borwein and Zhu (1996), Borwein 
and Zhu (1999), Deville (1999), El Haddad and Deville (1996) for a similar 
purpose. 
Theorem 5.2 Suppose X is reflexive, H is u.s.c. on domg* # 0 and such 
that H(.) < b+cII.II for some b,c E R. Let w : X x R+ -t IR be a weakly 1.s.c. 
Fre'chet supersolution to (H-J)-(B). Then w 2 v ,  the Hopf solution. 
Thus v is the lowest Frkchet supersolution to (H-J)-(B) when H fulfils the 
assumptions. 
Corollary 5.2 Suppose X is reflexive and H is U.S.C. 
on domg* and such 
that H ( - )  < b + c 1 1 . 1 1  for some b, c E R. Let w be a weakly 1.s.c. function on 
X x R+ which is such that w(., 0) = g and is a Fre'chet (or viscosity) solution 
to (H-J)-(B). Then v < w < u. 
If moreover g and H are convex, then w = v, the Hopf solution. 
It is shown in (Alvarez et a1 (1999) Thms 2.1 and 2.5) that the growth 
condition on H can be dropped when dimX < +oo. 
Well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard requires that when the data (g, H )  
are perturbed in a continuous way, the solution is perturbed in a continuous 
way. Up to now, this question seems to have been studied essentially in the 
sense of local uniform convergence. While this mode of convergence is well- 
suited to the finite dimensional case with finite data and solutions, it does not

fit our framework. Thus, in Penot (2000) and in Penot and Zalinescu (2001b) 
this question is considered with respect to sublevel convergence and to epicon- 
vergence (and various other related convergences). These convergences are well 
adapted to fonctions taking infinite values since they involve convergence of 
epigraphs. They have a nice behavior with respect to duality. However, the 
continuity of the operations involved in the explicit formulae require technical 
"qualification" assumptions (Penot and Zalinescu (2001a), Penot and Zalinescu 
(2001b)). 
We have not considered here the case H depends on x; we refer to Rockafellar 
and Wolenski (2000a), Rockafellar and P.R Wolenski (2000b) for recent progress 
on this question. We also discarded the case H depends on u(x). In such a 
case one can use operations similar to the infimal convolution 
such as the 
sublevel convolution o and quasiconvex dualities as introduced in Penot and 
Volle (1987)-Penot and Volle (1990) (see also Martinez-Legaz (1988), Martinez- 
Legaz (1988)). The papers Barron et a1 (1996)-Barron et a1 (1997) opened 
the way and have been followed by Alvarez et a1 (1999), Barron (1999), Volle 
(1998), Volle (1997)). A panorama of quasiconvex dualities is given in Penot 
(2000) which incites to look for the use of rare dualities, reminding the role the 
Mendeleiev tableau played in chemistry.

1 INTRODUCTION 
We begin with the following definitions. Let H be a set of functions defined 
on a set X .  A function f : X -+ R+, := IR U {+oo) is called abstract convex 
with respect to H (H- convex) if 
f (x) = sup{h(x) : x E supp (f, H)) for all x E X, 
(1.1) 
where supp (f, H )  = {h E H : h(x) < f (x) (V x E X )  is the support set of the 
function f with respect to H .  
A set H is called a supremal generator of a set F of functions f defined on 
X if each f E F is abstract convex with respect to H. A supremal generator 
H is a base (in a certain sense) of F ,  so some properties of H can be extended 
to the entire set F. (See Rubinov (2000), Chapter 6 and references therein for 
details.) If H is a "small" set then some of its properties can be verified by 
the direct calculation. Thus small supremal generators are very helpful in the 
examination of some problems. This observation explains, why a description of 
small supremal generators for the given broad class of functions is one of the 
main problems of abstract convexity. The reverse problem: to describe abstract 
convex functions with respect to a given set H, is also very interesting. 
If H consists of continuous functions then the set of H-convex functions is 
contained in the set LSCH of all lower semicontinuous functions f such that 
f 2 h for some function h E H .  (Here f 2 h stands for f (x) 2 h(x) for all 
x E X.) The set LSCH is very large. In particular, if constants belong to H ,  
then LSCH contains all bounded from below lower semicontinuous functions. 
As it turned out there are very small supremal generators of the very large set 
LSCH. These supremal generators can be described by means of the so-called 
peaking property (see Pallaschke and Rolewicz (1997) and references therein) 
or the technique based on functions, support to Urysohn peaks (see Rubinov 
(2000) and references therein). 
We present two known examples of such generators (see Rubinov (2000) and 
references therein). 
1) let X be a Hilbert space and H be the set of all quadratic functions h of the 
form 
2 
h(x) = -allx - xoll - c, 
x E X, 
where a 2 0, xo E X and c E R. 
Then H is a supremal generator of LSCH. 
The set H can be described by only three parameters: a point x E X, a number

143 
c E R and a number a E R+. If X coincides with n-dimensional space then 
the dimension of H is n + 2. 
2) Let X be a Banach space and H be the set of all functions h of the form 
where a > 0, xo E X and c E R. The set H is a supremal generator of LSCH. 
If X = Rn then the dimension of H again equal to n + 2. 
It is interesting to give a direct description of the set LSCH without ref- 
erences to the class H. We give such a description for a broad class of sets 
H, which possess the peaking property. Let X be a normed space and p be a 
continuous sublinear function defined on X and such that 
yp := inf p(x) > 0. 
Ilxll=l 
Let k be a positive number. We shall study the set Hk of all functions h of the 
form 
h(x) = -apk(x - XO) - c (x E X) 
(1.3) 
with xo E X, c E R and a > 0 and show that this set is a supremal generator 
of the class of functions P k ,  which depends only on k and does not depend on 
p. The class Pr, is very broad. It consists of all lower semicontinuous functions 
f : X -+ R+, such that liminfllxll++m 
f (x)/1x11 > -00. 
Consider the space X = IRn and a sublinear function p defined on X such 
that (1.2) holds. It is well-known that there exists a set of linear function 
Up such that p(x) = rnaxl,up[l, XI, where [L, x] stands for the inner product of 
vectors 1 and x. Let H1 be the set of functions defined by (1.3) for the given 
function p and k = 1. Since H1 is a supremal generator of PI, it follows that 
each function f E PI can be represented in the following form: 
f (x) = 
sup 
(-a max([L, x - xo] - c), 
(a,c,xo)EV(f) 
IEUp 
where V(f) = {(a, c, xo) : -ap(x - xo) - c < f (x) Q x E X )  and Up does not 
depend on f. Thus we have the following sup-min presentation of an arbitrary 
function f E PI through affine functions: 

144 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Since the class Pl does not depend on the choice of a sublinear function p with 
yp > 0 it is interesting to consider such functions p that the corresponding set 
Up has the least possible cardinality. Clearly, this cardinality is greater than or 
equal to n + 1, since for each function p(x) = ma%,l,...j[li, x] with j 5 n and 
nonzero li we have yp E minllxll,l p(x) < 0. We discuss this question in details 
( see Example 3.3, Example 3.4 and Remark 3.1). 
We shall also describe conditions, which guarantee that the so-called abstract 
convex subdifferentials are not empty. Recall the corresponding definitions ( 
Rubinov (2000)). Let X be an arbitrary set. A set L of functions defined on 
X ,  is called the set of abstract linear functions if for every 1 E L the functions 
hl,,(x) = 1(x) - c do not belong to L for each c # 0. The set HL = {hl,, : 
1 E L,c E IR} is called the set of L-affine functions. Let f be an HL-convex 
function. The set 
is called the L-subdifferential of the function f at a point xo. Clearly 1 E 
dL f (xO) if and only if f (xo) = h(xo) where h(x) := l(x) - c with c := f (xo) - 
l(xo). Due to the definition of L-subdifferential h(x) 5 f (x) for all x. Thus 
the L-subdifferential is not empty if and only if the supremum in the equality 
f (xo) = sup{h(x) : h E supp (f, HL)) is attained. 
The set H~ defined by (1.3) can be considered as the set HLk of Lk-affine 
functions where 
Lk = {lk,a,zo : a > 0,Xo E X, C E R}, 
(I*5) 
and lk,a,xo(x) = -apk(x-xO), (x E X). We express conditions, which guarantee 
that L~-subdifferential is not empty in terms of the calmness of degree k (see 
Theorem 4.1). Note that if L1-subdifferential dLl f (x) is not empty for all x 
then sup-min representation (1.4) become max-min representation. 
Note that the classical convex subdifferential df (x) of convex function f at 
the point x plays two different roles. First, a subgradient (that is an element of 
d f (2)) accomplishes a local approximation of f in a neighborhood of x. Second, 
a subgradient permits the construction of a global afine support, that is an affine 
function, which does not exceed f over the entire space and coincides with f 
at x. Generalizations of the notion of the convex subdifferential based on local 
approximation (global affine support, respectively) lead to nonsmooth analysis 
(abstract convexity, respectively). It is very important to unite such different

145 
theories as nonsmooth analysis and abstract convexity in the study of some 
concrete non-convex objects. We provide an example of such a unifications 
(see Proposition 4.1). 
2 SETS PK 
Let X be a normed space and k be a positive number. Denote by Pk the set 
of lower semicontinuous functions f : X + R+, such that f is bounded from 
below on each ball and 
f(x) > 
liminf - 
ll41-- 
llxllk 
(2.1) 
If X is a finite -dimensional space, then f E Pk if and only if f is lower 
semicontinuous and (2.1) holds. We describe some simple properties of the set 
P k  
1) P k  is closed under the pointwise addition; 
2) if f E Pk and g 2 f is a lower semicontinuous function, then g E P k  as 
well. In particular, if T is an arbitrary index set, ft E Pk for each t E T 
and (supt,T ft)(x) = SUPtE~ 
ft(x), then supt,, 
ft E 7%. 
3) If fl, f2 E P k ,  then the function x H min(fl(x), f2(x)) also belongs to 
P k  . 
4) Let f E Pk and g(x) = a f (x - xo) - c, where a > 0, xo E X and c E R. 
Then g E P k .  
5) Constants belong to Fk for all k > 0. Convex lower semicontinuous 
functions (in particular, linear continuous functions) belong to Fk for all 
k 2 1. 
Note also that Pl C Ppk 
if I < k. 
Let f : X + R+, and k > 0. Consider the function f k  defined by 
It follows from the definition of the class Pr, that Pk = {fk : f f El). We now 
describe some subsets of the set PI. 
1. Each lower semicontinuous positively homogeneous of degree one function, 
which is bounded from below on the unit ball, belongs to Pi; 

146 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
2. Each Lipschitz function belongs to PI. 
3. A function f : X + R+, is called radiant if f (ax) 5 a f (x) for all x E X 
and a E (0, 11. Equivalent definition: a function f is radiant if f (Py) > P f (y) 
for all y E X and P 2 1. Recall that a function f : X + R+, is called 
proper, if the set dom f := { x  : f(x) < + m )  is nonempty. The inequality 
f (0) 5 0 holds for each proper lower semicontinuous and radiant function f .  
Indeed, let y E dom f .  Since f (ay) 5 af (y) for all a E (0, I ) ,  it follows that 
f (0) 5 lim,,o 
f (ay) = 0. It is easy to see that f is radiant if and only if its 
epigraph epi f = {(x, A) E X x R : x E X : X > f ( x ) )  is a radiant set. (A 
subset 0 of a vector space is called radiant if this set is star-shaped with respect 
to zero, that is ( x  E 0, X E (0,l)) + (Ax E 0.)) 
We now show that every lower semicontinuous radiant function f ,  such that 
d := infllzllll f(x) > -00, belongs to PI. Assume without loss of generality 
that f is proper. Since f (0) 5 0 it follows that d 5 0. Let x E X and 
IIxII = P > 1. Then x = Px', where IIx'II = 1, SO 
Applying (2.2) we conclude that 
liminf fo > d > -m. 
1 1 ~ 1 1 + ~  IIxII 
Let us check that f is bounded from below on each ball B, = { x  : llxll 5 r). 
We can consider only balls with r > 1. Let x E B, and llxll > 1. Then 
due to (2.2) we have f(x) 2 llxlld 2 rd. If llxll 5 1, then f ( x )  2 d. Thus 
infl,lllr f (x) > dr > -m. 
4. Consider a function f with the star-shaped epigraph epi f .  This means 
that there exists a point (x, A) E X x R such that (y, p) E epi f * 
a(x, A) + 
(1 - a )  (y, p) E epi f for all a E (0,l). An equivalent definition: there is a 
point x and a number X such that aX + (1 - a) f (y) 2 f (ax + (1 - a)y) for all 
y E X and a E (0,l). Since each star-shaped set is a shift of a radiant set, it 
easily follows from 3 that a lower semicontinuous function with the star-shaped 
epigraph belongs to PI.

SUPREMAL GENERATORS OF T H E  SETS PK 
In this section we describe small suprema1 generators of the set Pk. Let X be a 
normed space and p be a continuous sublinear function defined on X with the

following property: there exists a number y > 0 such that 
p(x) > yllxll for all x E X. 
(3.1) 
Let a > 0, xo E X and lk,a,xo be a function defined on X by lk,a,xo(x) = 
-upk ( x  - xo). Consider the following sets: 
where 1(x) = 1 for a11 x E X. First of all we describe abstract convex with 
respect to ~"unctions. 
Let LSCHk be the set of all lower semicontinuous 
functions f such that the set supp ( f ,  H k )  = { h  E H% h 5 f }  is not empty. 
Lemma 3.1 LSCH. C Pk. 
Proof: Let f E LSCHk. Then f is lower semicontinuous and supp ( f ,  H" # 0. 
Let h E supp ( f ,  H ~ ) ,  
h(x) = -ap"x - xo) - c. Since h is bounded from below 
on each ball, it follows that f enjoys the same property. We have

Corollary 3.1 Each H"convex function belongs to Pk. 
Lemma 3.2 Each function f E Pk is  convex. 
Proof: It is sufficient to consider only finite functions. Indeed, for each f E Pk 
we have f ( x )  = sup, f,(x), where f,(x) = min( f (x), n), n = 1,2, . . . . So f is 
Hkconvex if each f ,  is  convex. 
Let f E Pk be a finite function. For each a > 0 consider the hypograph 
Ka = {(x, A) : X 5 -apk(x)} of the function lk,a,o(x) = -apk(x). Assume that 
for every xo E X and every E > 0 there exists a > 0 such that 

148 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Then f is H-convex. To prove it, take a point xo E X and arbitrary a > 0. Let 
a be a number such that (3.3) holds. Consider the function h(x) = -apk(x - 
xO) + (f (XO) - a). Let (xo, f (xo) - a) + Ka = K. We have 
k 
K = {(x, v) : x = xo + 9, U = f (xo) - E + p, p I -aP (Y)) 
= {(x,.) : x = xo + y : v I ~ ( x o )  
- a -  apk(y)) 
= {(x, v) : v 5 f (TO) - a - apk(x - xo)) 
= {(x,v) : u I h(x)). 
Let x E X and y = x - xo. Since (x, f (x)) E epi f it follows from (3.3) that 
(x, f (x)) $ (20, f (XO) - a) + Ka, so f (x) > h(x). Since h(xo) = f (xo) - a and 
a is an arbitrary positive number, we conclude that f (xo) = sup{h(xo) : h E 
SUPP (f, H ) ) .  
We now prove that (3.3) is valid. Assume in contrary that there exists 
xo E X and a > 0 such that for each positive integer n a pair (x,, A,) 
can 
be found such that (x,, A,) 
E epi f and (x,, A,) 
E (XO, f (xo) - a) + K,. 
Let 
(y,, p,) = (x,, A,) - (xo, f (xO) - a). It follows from above that 
An = f (XO) - + Pn; Pn I -npk(yn) 
(3.5) 
We consider separately two cases. 
1) The sequence p, is bounded. Since Ip,l 2 npyYn) it follows that pk(yn) -+ 
0. Since p(y) 2 ~llyll for a11 y, we conclude that y, -+ 0, so x, + xo. Due to 
lower semicontinuity off and the inequality in (3.4) we have 
liminf A, 2 liminf f (xn) L f ( ~ 0 ) .

n 
On the other hand 
so liminf, A, < f (50). We arrive at a contradiction, which shows that the 
sequence p, cannot be bounded. 
2) The sequence p, is unbounded. Without lost of generality assume that 
limn pn = -00. Then limn A, = lim,(f (xo) - E + p,) = -00, SO 
lim f (x,) = -00.

The function f is bounded from below on each ball therefore (3.6) implies 
unboundedness of the sequence xn. Since liminfllzll-+oo 
f (x)/IIxllk > -CO, we 
conclude that there exists c > 0 such that f (xn) 2 -cllxnllk for a11 sufficiently 
large n. Hence 
An 2 -cllxnllk 
(3.7) 
for these n. On the other hand, applying (3.5) we deduce that 
for all n. Due to (3.7) and (3.8), we have for all large enough n: 
It follows from (3.1) that 
Since Ilxnll/llynII + 1 as n -t +CO and llxnll is unbounded it follows that the 
sequence on the left hand of (3.9) is unbounded from below, which contradicts 
(3.9).

Theorem 3.1 Let P(H" be the set of all Hk-convex functions. Then 
P(H" = Pk = LSCHk. 
Proof: The result follows directly from Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2 and the obvious 
inclusion P ( H k )  c LSCHb.

We now present some examples. 
Example 3.1 Let X be a normed space. The set H1 of all functions h defined 
on X by h(x) = -allx - xo 11 - c with xo E X ,  a I 0, c E R is a supremal 
generator of PI. If Pl > H > H1, then H is also a supremal generator of Pl. 
In particular the set of all concave Lipschitz functions is a supremal generator 
of 7'1. 
Example 3.2 Let X be a Hilbert space and H2 be the set of all functions h 
defined on X by h(x) = 
+ [l,x] - c with a > 0,l E X , c  E R. 
(Here 

150 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
[l, x] is the inner product of vectors 1 and x). It is well known (see, for example, 
Rubinov (2000)) that H2 is a supremal generator of the set LSCH2. Clearly 
h E H2 if and only if there exists a point xo E X and a number c' E IR such 
that h(x) = -allx - xo [ I 2  - c'. So Theorem 3.1 shows that P2 coincides with 
the set of all H2-convex functions. 
Example 3.3 Let U be a closed convex bounded subset of a normed space 
X such that 0 E int U. Then the Minkowski gauge pu of the set U is a 
continuous sublinear function, such that infllzll=l 
pu(x) = y > 0. (Recall that 
pu(x) = inf{X > 0 : x E XU) for x E X.) Hence the set H~ of all functions 
h defined on X by h(x) = -a&(x - xo) - c with a > 0, xo E X, c E IR is a 
supremal generator of Pk. 
Example 3.4 The following particular case of Example 3.3 is of special in- 
terest. Let X be a n-dimensional space IRn, I = (1,. . . , m) and li (i E I )  are 
vectors such that their conic hull cone (11,. . . ,1,) 
:= {xi,, 
Aili : X 2 0 (i E I)) 
coincides with the entire space IRn. Then the set 
is bounded and contains a ball cB where B = {x : llxll < 1) and c > 0. Let p s  
be the Minkowski gauge of S. We have 
1 
1 
PS(X) I P=B(X) = - ~ B ( x )  = -IIxII for all x E IRn 
C 
C 
Thus the function p s  is finite. The set S is bounded, so there exists y > 0 such 
that S C (l/y)B. We have 
Let us calculate the Minkowski gauge ps. Since S = niEI 
Mi, where Mi = 
{x : [li, x] 5 1) and p ~ ,  
(x) = max([li, XI, 0) (i E I), it follows that ps(x) = 
max([ll, XI,. . . , [l,, XI, 0). Due to (3.11) we conclude that ps(x) > 0 for all 
nonzero x E IRn, so 
pS(x) = max([ll, XI, . . . , [l,, XI) for all x E IRn. 
(3.12) 
It follows from (3.12) and (3.11) that p = p s  is a continuous sublinear function, 
which possesses property (3.1), so the set H1 of all functions h of the form 

ABSTRACT CONVEX FUNCTIONS 
151 
with a 2 0, xo E Rn, c E R is a suprema1 generator of the set Pl. 
Remark 3.1 Consider a number m with the following property: there exist m 
vectors ll,. . . ,I, such that the sublinear functionp(x) = maxi=l,...,,[li, XI, (x E 
X )  is strictly positive for all x # 0. If m < n then this property does not hold 
for the function p. Indeed the system [li, x] = -1, i = 1,. . . , m has a solution 
for arbitrary nonzero vectors 11,. . . ,1,. 
It follows from the Example 3.4 that 
we can find corresponding vectors if m = n + 1. Thus the least number m, 
which possesses mentioned property, is equal to n + 1. 
In this section we describe sufficient conditions, which guarantee that the Lk- 
subdifferential is not empty. These conditions becomes also necessary for k = 1. 
Recall the following well known definition (see, for example, Burke (1991)). 
A function f : X -+ R+, is called calm at a point xo E dom f if 
We say that a function f is calm of degree k > 0 at xo E dom f if 
(This definition can be found, for example in Rubinov (2000).) 
Assume, we have a continuous sublinear function p defined on a normed 
space X, which enjoys the property (3.1). Let L~ be the set of abstract linear 
functions defined by (1.5). 
Theorem 4.1 1) Let f E P k  and xo E X. If the function f is calm of degree 
k at the point xo then the subdifferential d L k  f (XO) is nonempty and contains 
the function l(x) = -cp"x - xo) with some c > 0. 
2) If k = 1 and the subdifferential dLl f (xo) is nonempty then f is calm (of 
degree k = 1) at a point xo. 
Proof: 1) Assume that f is calm of degree k, that is (4.2) holds. Then there 
exist numbers cl and dl > 0 such that f (x) - f (xo) L cl llx - xoll if IIx - xoll < 
dl. Since liminf,,, 
f (x)/llxllk > -m it follows that there exist numbers ca 
and da > 0 such that f(x) 2 clllxlI"f 
11x11 > dh. Since 

152 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
we can find numbers c2 and d2 > 0 such that f (x) - f ( X O )  2 ~2 1 1  x - xo 11 
if 
llxll > d2. Consider the set D = { x  : llx - xoll 2 d l ,  11x11 I dz). Since the 
function f is bounded from below on the ball { x  : llxll I d2), it follows that 
there exists a number cg such that f ( x )  - f ( X O )  2 cgllx - xoll"or 
all x E D. 
Due to the inequality -113: - xollk 2 -(l/r)kp"x - xo) we can find a number 
c such that f ( x )  - f (xo) 2 cpyx - xo) for all x E X .  This means that the 
function 1(x) = -cp"x - xo) belongs to the subdifferential dLk f (xo). 
2) Let k = 1 and dLl f (xo) # 0. Let 1 E d ~ i  
f (xo), where l(x) = -ap(x-XI)-c. 
We have, 
so the function f is calm at the point xo.

Recall ( see, for example, Demyanov and Rubinov (1995)) that a function 
f defined on a normed space X is called subdifferentiable at a point x E X if 
there exists the directional derivative 
f b ( 4  = lim ( l l a ) ( f  ( x  + au) - f ( x ) )  
a++O 
for all u E X and f: is a continuous sublinear function. Each convex function f 
is subdifferentiable at a point x E int dom f .  A function f is called quasidiffer- 
entiable (see, for example, Demyanov and Rubinov (1995)) at a point x if the 
directional derivative fk exists and can be represented as the difference of two 
continuous sublinear functions. If f is the difference of two convex functions, 
then f is quasidifferentiable. 
The support set supp (r, X * )  of a continuous sublinear function r : X + IR 
with respect to the conjugate space X* will be denoted by dr. Note that 
dr coincides with the subdifferential (in the sense of convex analysis) of the 
sublinear function r at the point 0. 
Proposition 4.1 Let p be a continuous sublinear function, such that (3.1) 
holds and LI = {ll,a,y : a > 0, y E X ) ,  where I I , ~ , ~ ( X )  = -ap(x - 9). Let 
f E P1 be a locally Lipschitz at a point xo E X function. Then 
1) The L1-subdifferential dLl f (xo) is not empty and contains a function ll,,,,, 
with some c > 0. 

2) Let f be quasidifferentiable at the point xo and f;,(u) = rl(u) - r2(u),

Abstract: 
Dual-v Support Vector Machine (2v-SVM) is a SVM extension 
that reduces the complexity of selecting the right value of the error parameter 
selection. However, the techniques used for solving the training problem of the 
original SVM cannot be directly applied to 2v-SVM. An iterative decomposition 
method for training this class of SVM is described in this chapter. The training 
is divided into the initialisation process and the optimisation process, with 
both processes using similar iterative techniques. Implementation issues, such 
as caching, which reduces the memory usage and redundant kernel calculations 
are discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classification paradigm based on sta- 
tistical learning that has shown promise in real world applications. Successful 
use of SVMs in large scale applications include face detection (Osuna et al. 
(1997b)), target detection (Chew et al. (2000)), and text decoding using Sup- 
port Vector Regression (Chang and Lin (2001b)). 
The setting of the error penalty in the original SVM formulation (Burges 
(1998)) is essentially based on trial-and-error, which requires additional time 
consuming training. This shortcoming is partially overcome with the formula- 
tion of u-SVM by Scholkopf et al. (2000). A more general formulation, termed 
Dual-u-SVM (Chew et al. (2001a)) or 2u-SVM, provides better performance 
when the training class sizes are not the same, or when different class error 
rates are required. It is introduced in Section 2. 
The training of a SVM involves solving a large convex quadratic program- 
ming (QP) problem, and can only be solved numerically. There are issues with 
the computation and memory complexities that need to be addressed, before 
the training problem can be solved. A decomposition method well suited to 
handle such implementation concerns is described in Sections 3 and 5. 
As in any numerical optimisation, there is a starting point for the decision 
variables where the algorithm starts searching the path to the optimal point. 
In the original SVM formulation, the decision variables are set to zero. In 
2u-SVM, setting the decision variables to zero will result in an optimisation 
constraint being violated. It is therefore necessary to initialise the decision 
variables properly before the optimisation process can proceed. In Section 4, a 
systematic process of initialising the decision variables is discussed. Numerous 
implementation aspects on the initialisation and the decomposition are dealt 
with in Section 5.

Consider a set of 1 data vectors {xi, yi), with xi E R ~ ,  
yi E +1, -1, i = 1,. . . ,1, 
where 
is the i-th data vector that belongs to a binary class yi. We seek the 
hyperplane that best separates the two classes with the widest margin. More 
specifically, the objective of training the SVM is to find the hyperplane (Burges 
(1998))

to minimise 
where p is the position of the margins, and v is the error parameter to be de- 
fined later in the section. The function @ is a mapping function from the data 
space to the feature space to provide generalisation for the decision function 
that may not be a linear function of the training data. The problem is equiva- 
lent to maximising the margin 2/11wll, while minimising the cost of the errors 
Ci(vp - ti), where w is the normal vector and b is the bias, describing the 
hyperplane, and ti is the slack variable for classification errors. The margins 
are defined by w . x + b = f 
p. 
In the Dual-v formulation, we introduce v+ and v- as the error parameters 
of training for the positive and negative classes respectively, where 
Denoting the error penalty as

al. (2000) can be derived from 2v-SVM by letting v+ = 6 
and v- = &. 
The 2v-SVM training problem can be formulated as a Wolfe dual Lagrangian 
(Chew et al. (2001a)) problem. The Wolfe dual Lagrangian is explained by

In solving the 2u-SVM problem, constraint (2.13) can be written as an equality 
(Scholkopf et al. (2000)) during the optimisation process, 
This property is required in the training process and will be shown in Section 
3.3. 
3 OPTlMlSATlON METHOD 
Training a SVM involves the maximisation of a quadratic function. As the size 
of the data matrix Q, where Qij = yiyjKij, scales with 12, with most problems, 
it will not be possible to train a SVM using standard QP techniques without 
some sort of decomposition on the optimisation problem. 
Many methods had been suggested to solve the QP problem of the origi- 
nal formulation of SVMs: chunking (Vapnik (1995)), decomposition (Osuna et 
al. (1997a), and Hsu and Lin (2002)), and Sequential Minimal Optimization 
(SMO) (Platt (1999)). However, these methods cannot be directly applied to 
2u-SVM. The addition of the variable margin, p, increases the difficulty in 
determining the state of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions that some 
methods require during the process of optimisation. 
In this section, we will describe a decomposition method which has been 
approached from a pairwise decomposition viewpoint, and results in a method 
similar to that proposed by Chang and Lin (2001a).

A constrained convex QP problem can be broken down into a smaller QP 
problem at each iterative step, with a smaller set of decision variables. The 
solution is found when there is no set of decision variables that can be changed 
to maximise the objective function. We have chosen to break the problem 
down to a two decision variable problem, as the sub-problem can be solved 
analytically. The constraints imposed by the problem are still satisfied and are 
discussed in Section 3.3. 
3.1 Iterative decomposition training 
In the iterative optimisation process, the k-th iteration of the Lagrangian of 
The solution to the problem is obtained when no update 
that increases F ( ~ )  
while satisfying the constraints of the

problem. 
In the decomposition process (Joachims (1999)), the problem is divided into 
the working set B, and the non-working set N, where B and N are exclusive 
and B U N = (1.. .1). That is for a chosen working set B, 
and we desire the solution to the sub-problem FBB. The solution to the problem 
is obtained when no working set B can be found and updated that increases 
FBB while satisfying the contraints of the problem. 
We can combine the two processes to get a simple and intuitive method of 
solving the 2u-SVM training problem. At each interative step, the objective 
function is maximised with respect to only two variables. That is, we decompose 
the problem into a sub-problem with a working set of two points p and q. This 
decomposition simplifies the iterative step while still converges to the solution, 
due to the convex surface of the problem.

As only the p-th and q-th decision variables are updated, the change in the 
objective function at iteration (k + 1) is shown in the Appendix to be 
where 
We use (3.5) to train 2~-SVM by selecting the optimal decision variables to 
update at each iterative step until the objective function is at its maximum. 
3.2 Choosing optimising points 
In each iterative step, the objective function is increased by the largest amount 
possible in changing ap) and ag). We seek the pair of decision variables to 
update in each step by searching for the maximum change in the objective 
function in updating the pair. The optimal SPq for each (p, q) pair, denoted by 

TRAINING DUAL-v SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES 
163

is obtained from 
resulting in 
This in turn gives the maximum possible change in the objective function for 
the updated pair as 
The process for finding (p, q) is therefore to find 
f o r p , q ~ l ,  
..., 1. 
Using (3.9) requires 0 (12) operations to search for the (p, q) pair. We can 
reduce the complexity by simplifying the search to 
Although the new search criterion is a simplification of (3.9), due to the con- 
vexity of the objective function, the optimisation process still converges to the 
same maximum, albeit in a less optimal path, but has a search complexity of 
only 0 (E), as it only searches for the maximum and minimum of Glk). 
All kernel functions need to satisfy Mercer's condition (Vapnik (1995)). 
Mercer's condition states that the kernel is actually a dot product in some 
space and therefore, the denominator of (3.7) is 
which is positive for all valid kernel functions. Thus, it is clear that for the 
(p, q) pair found using either (3.9) or (3.10), we obtain d;q 2 0. If 61Tq = 0, the 
objective function is at its maximum and we have found the trained SVM. The 
iteration process continues as long as

3.3 Constraints of 2 ~ - S V M  
In maximising the objective function (2.10), constraints (2.11), (2.12) and 
(2.13) have to be satisfied. We now derive the conditions for meeting each 
constraint. 
Proposition 3.1 If {a,!')} satisfies (2.12)) and {a$"} is updated using (3.4)) 
then {a?)} satisfies (2.12) for any k. 
Proof: From (2.12) and using (3.4), 
Since {cup)} satisfies (2.12), by induction, {a!"} satisfies (2.12) for any k.

with 
Yp lP Yq, 
(3.12)

Proof: From (2.13), using (3.4) and (3.12), 
Since {a!O)} satisfies (2.13), by induction, {a!"} satisfies (2.13) for any k.

Remark 3.1 Due to (3.12)) the search for the update pair (p, q) is divided into 
two parts, one for each class. The class which returns the higher increase in 
the objective function is selected for the update process. 
Remark 3.2 Proposition 3.2 shows that the update process of the optimisation 
results in

(3.14) 
then {a{"')} satisfies (2.11) for any Ic.

on dpq are

Using dpq as stated in (3.14) will meet the constraints of (3.15) and (3.16), 
and therefore (2.11). Thus, if {a?)) satisfies (2.11), then by induction, {a!'")} 
satisfies (2.11) for any Ic. 
Remark 3.3 The selection process requires dpq > 0 for each iteration. From 
(3.15) and (3.16)) it is clear that we need 
From Propositions 3.2 and 3.3, the selection of the (p,q) pair for each it- 
eration therefore requires the search for (3.10) for each class, while satisfying 
(3.12), (3.17) and (3.18), to find dpq > 0 with (3.14).

INITIALISATION TECHNIQUE 
In Section 3.4, the optimisation procedure needs the decision variables to be 
initialised, such that constraints (2.11), (2.12) and (2.15) are satisfied. One ap- 
proach is to choose a number of decision variables to change, such that ai = Ci 
until the constraints are met. The selection of training points to update usually 
involves selecting the first n points in the training set, and updating the cor- 
responding decision variables, until the constraints are satisfied. This method 
of initialising the decision variables is used in most of the available u-SVM 
software packages, but it is not systematic. 
It is possible to initialise the decision variable using a similar iterative ap- 
proach to the optimisation process. The method in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 
will demonstrate that the selection of variables to update is systematic. The 
initialisation method also reduces the training time of the optimisation, while 
not taking more computational time to perform (Chew et al. (2001b)). 
4.1 Iterative decision variable initialisation 
Consider the Lagrangian of 2u-SVM (2.10). The t-th iteration of the Lagrangian 
(3.1) is rewritten to extract the a?) component of the function, for some 
r € 1, ..., 1, as 
As only the r-th decision variable is updated, we can derive the change in F,(t+') 
using the substitutions 
for some change, 6,. The objective function at iteration (t + 1) is shown in the 
Appendix to be 

TRAINING DUAL-v SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES 
169 
where 
We use (4.3) to initialise the set of decision variables such that the variables 
satisfy constraints (2.11), (2.12) and (2.15), for the training of 2u-SVMs, by 
selecting the optimal decision variable to update at each iterative step. 
4.2 Choosing initialisation points 
The training process of 2v-SVMs requires the maximisation of the objective 
function. Therefore, during the initialisation process, we seek the minimal 
decrease in the objective function when changing a?) = C,. 
We find the 
variable to update in each step by searching for the maximum increase (or 
minimum decrease) in the objective function in updating the pair, with 6, = C,, 
which is 
~ ~ , ( t + l )  
= ~ ( t + l )

(4.5) 
The process for finding r is therefore to find 
for all r E 1,. . . , I ,  and a?) = 0. 
4.3 Constraints of initialisation 
The iterative process for initialising ai is to vary ai in order to meet (2.15). 
However, the two other constraints (2.11) and (2.12) have to be satisfied in the 
process as well. While (2.11) is clearly never violated, an additional restriction 
is required to meet (2.12) when the process terminates. 
By combining (2.12) and (2.13), the constraints reduce to 
Similarly, by combining (2.12) and (2.15), the constraints reduce to 

170 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
In the search for r at each iteration, (4.7) allows the exclusion of the class 
that has met the constraint. The selection process therefore searches for r in a 
reduced set of training points, 
Note that (2.15) is more stringent than (2.13), implying that meeting (2.15) 
is sufficient for (2.13). Consequently, we refine the update equation (4.2) to 
(4.10) to satisfy (4.8). 
Proposition 4.1 Let N ( ~ )  
be defined by (4.9). If the search for r E N ( ~ )  
uses 
(4.6) in the {ai) initialisation, and the update of a!') at each iteration t uses 
the resulting set of ai will satisfy (4.8) at the end of the initialisation process. 
Proof: F'rom (4.9), we see that 4:) 
= 0. Therefore the updated 
a?+') for 
class y, is 
Since the initialisation process terminates when (4.7) is satisfied, it follows from 
(4.11) that (4.8) is satisfied. 0 
Proposition 4.2 The number of iterations required in the initialisation is only 

TRAINING DUAL-u SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES 
171 
Proof: The derivation of (4.12) is given in the Appendix. 
The iterative process of initialising the decision variables is therefore to find 
r E N ( ~ )  
using (4.6), and updating a?) with (4.10). The result of the initial- 
isation process is a set of decision variables, {ai), that satisfies the training 
constraints imposed on 2v-SVMs, as well as reduces the training time required.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES 
Training 2v-SVMs is a computationally expensive process. The iterative process 
described in Section 3 provides a working optimiser that allows large problems 
to be solved without the need for large amounts of memory to store the Hessian, 
Q. The process can be further improved to reduce the computational complex- 
ity. 
Three issues are discussed on the possible improvements to the computa- 
tional performance of the optimisation: the kernel calculations, the optimisa- 
tion process, and the initialisation process. We shall see in Section 5.3 that 
the initialisation process, besides initialisation of the decision variables, also 
initialise the caches for the optimisation, as part of the process. 
5.1 Kernel calculations 
The kernel calculations form a large proportion of the computational load in 
the training process, as each stage of both iterative processes requires Kij. 
Kij usually involves expensive calculations, such as the exponential for radial 
basis function kernels, and the numeric powers for polynomial kernels. The 

TRAINING DUAL-V SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES 
173 
calculation of Kij each time can be avoided by caching it as a 1 x 1 matrix K ,  
but it is impossible to store the whole matrix for all but the smallest training 
problems. For example, we would require 800 Megabytes of cache for 1 = 10240 
using double precision floating point numbers. 
It is, however, possible to cache only Kij for aj > 0. The two algorithms 
stated here mainly requires only Gi, and can safely ignore the terms where 
aj = 0. Thus we only need to cache the columns of K where aj > 0. This 
caching method will improve the performance of the optimisation by reducing 
the number of kernel calculations required. As the optimisation process is 
iterative, the set of {jlaj > 0) changes as the iteration progresses. The strategy 
to manage the caching is to add columns to the cache when aj = 0 becomes 
non-zero, and to only remove columns when memory is full. The column where 
aj = 0, and that was unused for the longest time, is removed first. 
It is also useful to cache the diagonal of the kernel matrix, Kii, as it only 
requires I elements and is used in each step of both algorithms. 
5.2 Optimisation process 
The training process involves the iterative maximisation of the objective func- 
tion, by way of finding the maximum sg") for the positive class and the 
negative class. It is easy to see that finding the maximum s$:+') 
is basically 
finding the maximum and minimum of G!". 
This is why the process has a 
complexity of only O(1) instead of 0(12). 
The calculation of G:" 
can be reduced significantly by updating it at each 
iteration rather than recalculating it again. Since only the p-th and q-th deci- 
sion variables are changed, from (3.6) and using (3.4), 
which has a complexity of O(1) rather than 0(12), when updating Gik"), for 
all i E 1,. . . ,l. Note that the kernel functions required by the update are for 

174 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
columns p and q of the kernel matrix. As a, > 0 and a, > 0 at iteration (k) 
or (k + I), the columns will be cached by the caching strategy of Section 5.1. 
We also have to consider the cost involved in initialising the Gi cache, that 
is Gik=O). Assuming that the number of non-zero decision variables is m, 
(k=O) 
calculating Gi 
would require O(m1) loops and kernel calculations. However, 
(k=O) 
we will see in the next section that the initialisation method provides Gi 
in its process as well. 
5.3 Initialisation calculations 
The initialisation process seeks the minimum of I,(~+'), which has one dynamic 
term 2ciyiGjt), and one static term (Ci)2Kii. The static term can be calculated 
at the start of the process, cached, and added to the dynamic term at each 
iteration. 
As in the optimisation process, G?) in the dynamic term, can be updated at 
each iteration to reduce the computation requirements. From (4.4), and using 
(4.2) with 6, = C,, 
Again, updating Gttf l) has a complexity of O(1). 
Here, we see that at the beginning of the initialisation process, all decision 
variables are zero, att=') = 0. This means G:=O) 
= 0 and no columns of the 
kernel matrix cache are required. At each iteration, a zero decision variable r 
is updated, resulting in adding column r of the kernel matrix to the cache, and 
updating Gdt+'). The process terminates after n = [v+l+] + [LL] 
iterations 
(4.12), with G?=") and kernel cache of { j la:=") 
> 0 columns. Noting that 
(k) 
the initialisation process has provided the Gi 
cache and kernel column cache 
needed in the optimisation process. 

TRAINING DUAL-v SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES 
175 
Note that n is also the minimum number of non-zero decision variables in 
{ai) that will satisfy the constraints of 2v-SVM training, that is n 5 m. Addi- 
tionally, the calculation of G,!t) has a complexity of O(n1). We assume that the 
calculation of Git) is the major computational proportion of the initialisation 
process. Thus, the computational complexity of initialising the decision vari- 
ables is lower than that needed to calculate GLk=') for the optimisation process 
proper, as O(n1) 5 O(m1). This means that the cost of initialising the decision 
variable is minimal and comparable to that of the ad hoc initialisation process 
that many current implementations use. This new initialisation process has the 
advantage of reducing the number of optimisation iterations to train 2v-SVM.

PERFORMANCE RESULTS 
We tested the iterative method against the exisiting ad hoc method using three 
datasets. The ad hoc method initialises the first few decision variables until the 
constraints are met before the optimisation step. Each dataset is trained with 
the error parameters set to v+ = v- = 0.2, and using three different kernels: 
linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF). 
The first dataset is a face detection problem with 1,000 training points, 
with each point being an image. The dataset is trained with the linear, the 
polynomial (degree 5), and the RBF (a = 4,000) kernels. The second dataset 
is a radar image vehicle detection problem with 10,000 training points. The 
dataset is trained with the linear, the polynomial (degree 5), and the RBF 
(a = 256) kernels. The third dataset is a handwritten digit recognition problem 
(digit 7 against other digits) with 100,000 training points, and is trained with 
the linear, the polynomial (degree 4), and the RBF (a = 15) kernels. This 
dataset is also trained with v+ = v- = 0.01, using the polynomial and RBF

The 2v-SVMs are trained on an Intel Pentium 4 (2GHz) Linux machine, 
and the results are given in Table 6.1. The table shows the iterative initisation 
method provides improvements for most of the tests. The iterative initialisation 
method may increase the training time for small problems, but this is mainly 
due to the slow convergence of the optimisation process, as seen in the face 
detection problem using the polynomial kernel. 
Figure 6.1 shows more clearly that while the computational time required for 
initialisation is not reduced, there is a significant reduction in the optimisation

7 CONCLUSIONS 
2v-SVM is a natural extension to SVM that allows different bounds for each of 
the binary classes, and compensation for the uneven training class size effects. 
We have described the process for training 2v-SVMs using an iterative process. 
The training process consists of the initialisation and the optimisation proper. 
Both use a similar technique in their iterative procedures. 
Simulation and evaluations of the training process are continuing, and some 
results were reported in Chew et al. (2001b). The initialisation process has been 
found to reduce the training optimisation time, and does not require significant 
costs in computing the decision variable. 
In general, the optimisation process is expensive, in terms of computing 
and memory utilisation, as well as the time it takes. By using caches and 
decomposition in the process presented in this work, the problems of high 
memory usage and redundant kernel calculations are overcome. Specifically, 
the memory utilisation complexity is reduced from 0(12) to 0(1), to cache the 
kernel calculations. 
The method presented has led to an efficient classifier implementation. It 
can be implemented readily on desktop workstations, and possibly on high 
performance embedded systems.

Abstract: The Barzilai and Borwein gradient method does not ensure descent 
in the objective function at each iteration, but performs better than the clas- 
sical steepest descent method in practical computations. Combined with the 
technique of nonmonotone line search etc., such a method has found success- 
ful applications in unconstrained optimization, convex constrained optimization 
and stochastic optimization. In this paper, we give an analysis of the Barzilai 
and Borwein gradient method for two unsymmetric linear equations with only 
two variables. Under mild conditions, we prove that the convergence rate of 
the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method is Q-superlinear if the coefficient 
matrix A has the same eigenvalue; if the eigenvalues of A are different, then the 
convergence rate is R-superlinear. 
Key words: 
Unsymmetric linear equations, gradient method, convergence,

1 INTRODUCTION 
Consider the problem of minimizing a strongly convex quadratic, 
where A E Rnxn is a real symmetric positive definite matrix and b E Rn. The 
Barzilai and Borwein gradient method Barzilai & Borwein (1988) for solving 
(1.1) has the form 
xk+l = x k  - a k g k ,  
(I.2) 
where gk is the gradient off at x k  and a k  is determined by information achieved 
at the points xk-1 and x k .  Denote sk-1 = x k  - xk-1 and yk-1 = gk - gk-1. 
One choice for the stepsize a k  is such that the matrix Dk = akI satisfies a 
certain quasi-Newton relation: 
yielding 
~ T - ~ s k - l  
a k  = T 
sk-lYk-l 
(1.4) 
Compared with the classical steepest descent method, which can be dated 
to Cauchy (1847), the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method often requires 
less computational work and speeds up the convergence greatly (see Akaike 
(1959); Fletcher (1990)). Theoretically, Raydan (1993) proved that the Barzi- 
lai and Borwein gradient method can always converge to the unique solution 
x* = A-'b of problem (1.1). If there are only two variables, Barzilai & Bor- 
wein (1988) established the R-superlinear convergence of the method; for any 
dimensional convex quadratics, Dai & Liao (2002) strengthened the analysis of 
Raydan (1993) and proved the R-linear convergence of the Barzilai and Borwein 
gradient method. A direct application of the Barzilai and Borwein method in 
chemistry can be found in Glunt (1993). 
To extend the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method to minimize a general 
smooth function

X E  Rn, 
(1.5) 
Raydan (1997) considered the use of the nonmonotone line search technique 
by Grippo et a1 (1986) for the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method which 
cannot ensure descent in the objective function at each iteration. The resulting

algorithm, called the global Barzilai and Borwein algorithm, is proved to be 
globally convergent for general functions and is competitive to some standard 
conjugate gradient codes (see Raydan (1997)). A successful application of the 
global Barzilai and Borwein algorithm can be found in Birgin et a1 (1999). The 
idea of Raydan (1997) was further extended in Birgin et a1 (2000) for minimiz- 
ing differentiable functions on closed convex sets, resulting in a more efficient 
class of projected gradient methods. Liu & Dai (2001) recently provided a 
powerful scheme for unconstrained optimization problems with strong noises 
by combining the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method and the stochastic ap- 
proximation method. Other work related to the Barzilai and Borwein gradient 
method can be found in Birgin et a1 (2000). Because of its simplicity and nu- 
merical efficiency, the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method has been studied 
by many researchers. 
It is trivial to see that problem (1.1) is equivalent to solving the symmetric 
positive definite linear system 
AX = b. 
(1.6) 
Denoting gr, to be the residual at xk, namely 
one can similarly define the steepest descent method and the Barzilai and Bor- 
wein gradient method for problem (1.6). F'riedlander et a1 (1999) presented 
a generalization of the two methods for problem (1.6), and compared several 
different strategies of choosing the stepsize a k .  To develop an efficient algo- 
rithm based on the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method for solving nonlinear 
equations, we present in this paper an analysis of the Barzilai and Borwein 
gradient method for the unsymmetric linear system (1.6), where A E RnXn is 
nonsingular but not necessarily symmetric positive definite. 
As shown in the coming sections, the analysis of the Barzilai and Borwein 
gradient method is difficult for the unsymmetric linear equation (1.6). In this 
paper, we assume that there are only two variables and A has two real eigen- 
values. In addition, we assume that 
The condition (1.8) does not imply the positive definiteness of A, which is re- 
quired in the analysis of Barzilai & Borwein (1988), Dai & Liao (2002), and 

186 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Raydan (1993). Under the above assumptions, we prove that if the eigenvalues 
of A are the same, the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method is Q-superlinearly 
convergent (see Section 2). If A has different eigenvalues, the method converges 
for almost all initial points and the convergence rate is R-superlinear (see Sec- 
tion 4). The two results strongly depend on the analyses of two recurrence 
relations, namely (2.8) and (4.11) (see Sections 3 and 5, respectively). Some 
concluding remarks are drawn in Section 6. 
2 
CASE OF IDENTICAL EIGENVALUES 
Assume that A1 and A2 are the two nonzero real eigenvalues of A. Since the 
Barzilai and Borwein gradient method is invariant under orthogonal transfor- 
mations, we assume without loss of generality that the matrix A in (1.6) has 
where 6 E R1. In this section, we will consider the case that A has two equal 
eigenvalues, namely 
A1 = A2 = A. 
(2.2) 
By relations (1.2) and (1.7), we can write 
Noting that the condition (1.8) is equivalent to 
g r ~ g k  # 0, 
for all k 2 0, 
(2.7) 
we have by (2.4)-(2.5) that gf)gf) # 0 for all k. Thus tk is well defined and 
tk # 0. The relation (2.7) also implies that 6 # 0, for otherwise the algorithm

gives the solution in at most two steps. Furthermore, the division of (2.4) by 
(2.5) yields the recurrence relation 
By Theorem 3.1, we know that there exists at most a zero measure set S such 
that 
lirn ltkl = +m, 
for all (tl, t2) E R2\S. 
k+w 
(2.9) 
Then by (2.4), we can show that for most initial points, the Barzilai and 
Borwein gradient method converges globally and the convergence rate is Q- 
superlinear. 
Theorem 2.1 Consider the linear equations (1.6), where A E R~~~ is non- 
singular and has two identical real eigenvalues. Suppose that the Barzilai and 
Borwein gradient method (1.2) and (1.4) is used, satisfying (1.8). Then for all 
(tl, 
t 2 )  E R2\S, where S E R2 is some zero measure set in R2, we have that 
lirn gk = 0. 
k+m 
Further, the convergence rate is Q-superlinear, namely 
Proof: By Theorem 3.1, we know that relation (2.9) holds for some zero mea- 
sure set in R2. It follows from (2.6), (2.9), and (2.2) that

Therefore this theorem is true. 
In practical computations, it was found that the relation limk,, 
Itk/ = +oo 
always holds for any tl and tz, and that the sequence {llgkll) generated by 
the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method is Q-superlinearly convergence if 
X1 = X2. 
In the case of identical eigenvalues, the number 161 provides an indication 
of the extent to which A is close to a symmetric matrix. From relation (2.13), 
we can see that the smaller 161 is, the faster the Barzilai and Borwein gradient 
method converges to the solution.

PROPERTIES OF THE RECURRENCE RELATION (2.8) 
In this section, we analyze the recurrence relation (2.8) and establish the prop- 
erty (2.9) for the sequence {tk) after giving some lemmas. 
(ii) Define 
= -tk. Then we also have that 
= & - 
- fiJl 
Proof: The statements follow directly from (2.8) and the definition of {&). 
Lemma 3.2 Suppose that {ak) is a positive sequence that satisfies 
Then {ak) is disconvergent, namely lim ak = +oo. 
k-w 
Proof: Relation (3.1) and ak > 0 indicates that {ak) is monotonically in- 
creasing. Assume that 
lim ak = M < +oo. 
k-03 
Then by this and (3.1), we get that 
lim ak 2 M + M-l, 
k-m 
(3.3) 
which contradicts (3.2). So this Lemma is true.

Lemma 3.3 Consider the sequence {tk) that satisfies (2.8) and tk # 0 for 
all k. Then there exists at most a zero measure set S in R2 such that for all 
(tl, t2) E R2\S, one of the following relations holds for some integer k: 
Proof: Assume that neither (3.4) nor (3.5) holds for all 
2 1. Then there 
must exist an integer k such that either tk > 0, tr2.+1 < 0 or 
Since tk and -& = -tk satisfy the same recurrence relation by part (ii) of Lemma 
3.2, we assume without loss of generality that (3.6) holds. Then by (3.6) and 
(2.8), we have that 
= 
- tg - t i 1  > 0. It follows that 
< 0, for 
otherwise (3.4) holds with k = i + 1. Similarly, we can prove that 
The repetition of the above procedure yields

f o r a l l i > O a n d j = 1 , 2 ;  
t"4"j { < 0, 
for all i 2 0 and j = 3,4.

t~+4i+l + tii4i+1 
< ti+4i+l+ Itk+4i+2 + t'l k+4i+2 1-I ' 
(3.11) 
In addition, it follows by 
< 0 and (2.8) with k replaced by i + 4i + 1 that 
> t- 
t&+4i+2 - k+4i+l + 2, 
(3.12) 
which, with (3.9), implies that 
< 1 < ti+,,+, . Since t +t-l is monoton- 
ically decreasing for t e (0, I), we can conclude from (3.11) that

It follows from (3.9) and (3.15) that 
Iti+4i+3 1 = Iti+ri+l I - (t~+4i+2 - tit4i+1) 
< Iti+e+i I .  
In addition, we can see from the definition of tk+4i+4 
and (3.8) that 
1 
Itk+4i+4I > Itk+4i+21 + Itk+4i+21- . 
Similar to (3.15)-(3.17), we can prove the following three relations 
1 
Itk+4i+s I > Itii+4i+4I + ltk+4i+4 1 -  
By (3.17), (3.20), and Lemma 3.2, we get that

This together with (3.15), (3.16), (3.18), and (3.19) indicates that

(3.28) 
Then it follows from (3.25), (3.26), and (3.28) that 
On the other hand, by (3.24) and the first part of (3.27), we see that 
Noting that {-tk) and {tk) satisfy the same recurrence relation and replac- 
ing all tk+4i+j with -tL+4i+j+2

(3.33) 
which, together with (3.28) and (3.24), gives 
Similarly, we also have that 
Substituting (3.34) into (3.35) and comparing the resulting expression with 
(3.29) yield

(3.38) 
Substituting (3.37) into (3.38) and comparing it with (3.29), we then obtain 
Recursively, we know that for any j the coefficient of $+4i+l 
in hh+4i+l is 
uniquely determined. It follows from this and (3.23) that t ~ + , ~ + ~  
= 
- 
hL+4i+ltk+4i+l is uniquely determined. In other words, for any tL+,,+, > 0, 
there exists at most one value of tL+4i+2 such that the cycle (3.8) occurs. 
Therefore there exists at most a zero measure set S in R2 such that the cycle 
(3.8) occurs for (tl, t2) E S. This completes our proof. 
Theorem 3.1 Consider the sequence {tk) that satisfies (2.8). Then there ex- 
ists at most a zero measure set S in R2 such that 
Proof: By Lemma 3.3, we know that there exists at most a zero measure set 
S in R2 such that (3.4) or (3.5) holds for some 
if (tl, t2) E R2\S. Assume 
without loss of generality that (3.4) holds, for otherwise we may consider the 
sequence & = -tk. Then by part (i) of Lemma 3.1 and relation (3.4), we have 
that 
Since t + t-l > 2 for t > 0, it follows from (3.41) and (3.4) that t
~
+
~
 
< -2. 
Consequently, 
By relations (3.41)-(3.43), we can similarly show that ti+6 > 0, 
> 0 and 
t ~ + *  > 0. The repetition of this procedure yields 
for alli > 0 and j = 0,1,2; 
(3.44) 
for all i > 0 and j = 3,4,5.

The above relation, (2.8), (3.41), and (3.42) indicate that 
ItL+3(i+l)+jI 2 ItL+3i+jI + l t ~ + ~ i + ~ I - ~ ,  
for all i > 0 and j = 0,l. 
(3.45) 
Thus by Lemma 3.2, we obtain 
lim lt6+3i+jI = +m, 
for j = 0,l. 
i+m 
(3.46) 
It remains to prove that 
lim ltL+3i+21 = +m. 
i+oo 
For this aim, we first show that 
lim sup ltL+3i+2 
I = +m. 
(3.48) 
i-oo 
In fact, if (3.48) is not true, then there exists some constant M > 1 such that 
ItH+3i+21 I M, for a11 i 2 0. 
(3.49) 
Relation (3.46) implies that there exists some integer i > 0 such that 
ltiC+3i+31 > %Id, 
for a11 i > i.

CASE OF DIFFERENT EIGENVALUES 
In this section, we analyze the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method for un- 
symmetric linear equations (1.6), assuming that the coefficient matrix A, in the 
form of (2.1) has two different real eigenvalues, i.e.,

If A is symmetric, namely S = y = 0, the above relation reduces to

lai and Borwein gradient method (see Barzilai & Borwein (1988)). In this paper, 
we assume that y # 0. 
For simplicity, we denote T = y-2 and define the sequence

For the sequence pk that satisfies (4.11), if (Ipll, Ip21) # ( d m ,  d m ) ,

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
From the above relations, we can show that if A has two different eigenvalues, 
the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method converges globally and its conver- 
gence rate is R-superlinear. 
Theorem 4.1 Consider the unsymmetric linear equations (1.6), where A E 
R2x2 is given in (2. I), with A1 # Az, XlA2 # 0 and S # 0. Assume that 
Then for the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method (1.2) and (1.4), if (1.8) 
holds, we have that

(4.17) 
Fbrther, the convergence rate is R-superlinear. 
Proof: It follows from (4.4), (4.7) and (4.10) that 
The condition (4.16) implies that 
Thus by Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, we know that there exists some integer i such 
that the relations (4.12)-(4.15) hold. For any sufficient small E > 0, let E E 
(0, E) to be another small number. For this 8, we know from (4.12) and (4.14) 
that there exists an integer such that for all i > i, 
where c > 0 is some constant. Further, since d < E, it follows from (4.21), 
(4.13), and (4.15) that there exist an integer i 2 such that for all i 2 i,

Thus for any E > 0, the following relation holds with some positive constants 
cl and c2:

(4.24) 
The definition of uk implies that gk = P-luk, this and (4.24) give 
where c3 = fiII~-~112cl. Relation (4.25) indicates that the sequence {Ilgkll) is 
globally convergent and the convergence rate is R-superlinear. 
Theorem 2.1 tells us that under certain conditions on A, the Barzilai and 
Borwein gradient method is R-superlinearly convergent for most initial starting 
points xl and 2 2 .  If (4.16) does not hold, namely 
direct calculations show that 
(~~+2i,Pi~+2i+l) 
= (-m, 
m), 
for some > 0 and all i 2 0. (4.27) 
By this relation, (4.18) and (4.19), we see that if X1X2 > 0, then the Barzilai 
and Borwein gradient method is linearly convergent; otherwise, if XIXz < 0, 
the method needs not converge. Here it is worthwhile pointing out that the 
case of (4.16) can be avoided if the first stepsize a1 is computed by an exact 
line search. 
Since

(4.28) 
the value of T can be regarded as a quantity that shows the degree to which the 
matrix A is close to a symmetric matrix. Relation (4.25) indicates that, the 
bigger T is, namely if A is closer to a symmetric matrix, the faster the Barzilai 
and Borwein gradient method converges to the solution.

Lemma 5.1 shows that the sequences pk and r k  satisfy the same recurrence

Lemma 5.2 Consider the sequence pk that satisfies (4.11) and pk # O,1 for

Thus by (5.13), the following relation holds 
Substituting (5.15) into (5.13), we can then obtain

However, due to the relation between {rk) and {pk), similarly to (5.15) we

Since the value on the right hand side of (5.17) is not equal to the one of (5.18)

this lemma is true.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this paper, we have given an analysis of the Barzilai and Borwein gradient 
method for unsymmetric linear equations, assuming that the dimension n = 
2. Under mild assumptions, we have proved that the convergence rate of the 
Barzilai and Borwein gradient method is Q-superlinear if the coefficient matrix 
A has two same eigenvalues; if the eigenvalues of A are different, then the 
method converges for almost all starting points XI and x2 and the convergence 
rate is R-superlinear. These results strongly depend on the study of the two 
nonlinear recurrence relations, namely (2.8) and (4.11), making the analyses 
difficult. 
F'rom the relations (2.13) and (4.25), we can see that the convergence of 
the Barzilai and Borwein gradient is related to the symmetric degree of the 
coefficient matrix A. If A is close to a symmetric matrix, then the method 
converges rapidly; conversely, if the matrix A is markedly unsymmetric, then 
the method will converge slowly. The convergence of the Barzilai and Bor- 
wein gradient method for unsymmetric linear equations is slower than that for 
symmetric linear equations. In the symmetric case, the Barzilai and Borwein 
gradient method can give the solution in at most two steps if A has two same 
eigenvalues; if the eigenvalues of A are different, we know from Barzilai & Bor- 
wein (1988) that the R-superliner convergence order of the method is 
- E ,  
where E > 0 is any small number. In the unsymmetric case, however, relation 

210 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
(4.25) indicates that the R-superlinear order of the method for unsymmetric 
linear equations is only 1 if A has two different eigenvalues. Thus to accelerate 
the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method for unsymmetric linear equations, it 
may be worthwhile studying how to make a transformation to an unsymmetric 
matrix that improves its symmetric degree. 
This paper have made some efforts on directly extending the convergence 
result in Barzilai & Borwein (1988) of the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method 
to the unsymmetric linear equations. As pointed out by the referee, another 
possibility is to apply the method to the symmetric (least square) system 
A ~ A X  
= ~
~
b
,
 
(6.1) 
that is equivalent to (1.6) in theory if A is nonsingular. In this case, since ATA 
is symmetric and positive definite, we know by Barzilai & Borwein (1988) and 
Dai & Liao (2002) that the Barzilai and Borwein gradient method for (6.1) 
is R-linearly convergent and if n = 2, the convergence rate is R-superlinear. 
In practical computations, transforming (1.6) into (6.1) has two main disad- 
vantages; namely the condition number of the problem will be squared and 
the multiplications of A transpose with vectors will be unavoidable. It is not 
known yet which is the better approach in extending the Barzilai and Borwein 
gradient method for solving unsymmetric linear equations.

MINIMIZING SUM-MIN FUNCTIONS

Abstract: The problem of minimizing maxmin-type functions or the sum of 
minimum-type functions appears to be increasingly interesting from both the- 
oretical and practical considerations. Such functions are essentially nonsmooth 
and, in general, they can successfully be treated by existing tools of Nonsmooth 
Analysis. In some cases the problem of finding a minimizer of such a function 
can be reduced to solving some mixed combinatorial-continuous problem. 
In the present paper the problem of minimizing the sum of minima of a finite 
number of functions is discussed. It is shown that this problem is equivalent to 
solving a finite (though may be quite large) number of simpler (and sometimes 
quite trivial) optimization problems. Necessary conditions for global a minimum 
and sufficient conditions for a local minimum are stated. An algorithm for 
finding a local minimizer (the so-called exchange algorithm) is proposed. It 
converges to a local minimizer in a finite number of steps. A more general 
algorithm (called €-exchange algorithm) is described which allows one to escape 
from a local minimum point. Numerical examples demonstrate the algorithm. 
Key words: Sum-min function, necessary conditions for a minimum, sufficient 
conditions, exchange algorithm, &-exchange algorithm.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Let functions 9ij(x) : Rn -+ R be given, where i E I := 1 : m, j E Ji := 1 : Ni. 
Construct the functions 
and the function 
The function F defined by (1.2) is called a sum-min function. Many practical 
problems arising, e.g., in Mathematical Diagnostics, Data Mining, Clustering, 
Network Allocation etc. (see Mangasarian (1997), Rao (1971), Bagirov, Ru- 
binov (1999), Bagirov, Rubinov, Yearwood (2001), Rubinov (2000)) can be 
described by mathematical models where it is required to find a minimizer of 
F. The problem of minimizing the function F is, first of all, generally speak- 
ing, nonsmooth (even if all the functions cpij's are quite good) and "extremely" 
multiextremal. The nonsmoothness can be treated by the existing tools of 
Nonsmooth Analysis and Nondifferentiable Optimization (for example, local 
properties of F can be studied, under some conditions, imposed on Pij, by 
considering the directional derivatives of F). But the multiextremality remains 
the main unavoidable obstacle. 
In the paper we consider the problem of minimizing one class of sum-min 
functions (the so-called separable-like sum-min functions). It is known that 
this problem is equivalent to solving a finite number of "simpler" problems. 
Namely, it is shown that 
inf F(x) = min inf Fj(x) 
xeRn 
j E J  xERn 
where 
A similar result for the best piece-wise polynomial approximation problem was 
proved in Vershik, Malozemov, Pevnyi (1975). 
For every j E J the function Fj(x) is called an elementary function, and 
it is assumed that one is able to find a minimizer of Fj(x) (exactly or ap- 
proximately). The problem of minimizing Fj(x) will also be referred to as 

AN EXCHANGE ALGORITHM FOR SUM-MIN FUNCTIONS 
215 
an elementary problem. In some cases the problem of minimizing Fj is quite 
simple (see Examples in Section 7). 
Theoretically, it is possible to find a global minimizer of the function F 
by solving all elementary problems, however, the number of such elementary 
problems is too large, therefore it is important to be able to find a proper local 
minimizer at a reasonable computational price. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 a special case of the above 
problem is stated (namely, the case m = 2 and vij(x) = vij(xi), where x = 
(XI, ..., x,), 
xi E Rni, xiGI 
ni = n). A result analogous to (1.3) is formulated 
in Section 3. Necessary conditions for a point to be a global minimizer and 
sufficient conditions for a point to be a local minimizer is proved in Section 
4. An algorithm for finding a local minimizer is described in Section 5. This 
algorithm (called an exchange algorithm) is based on the necessary minimality 
conditions. In a finite number of steps a local minimizer is constructed. In 
Section 6 a modification of the exchange algorithm (c-exchange algorithm) 
is proposed to "escape" from a local minimum point. Illustrative numerical 
examples are described in Section 7.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
Let a set of points R = {tl, . . . , t ~ )  
C Y (where Y is some space) and functions 
pi : R x Rni -+ R, i E 1 : m, be given. Put x = (xl,. . . ,x,) 
E S := 
Rnl x ... x Rnm.

Problem P: Find a point x* = (xi,. . . , x&) E S, such that 
F(x*) = min F(x). 
r E S  
In the paper the case m = 2 is described in detail. Note that no specific 
requirements on pi are imposed (the functions pi's are not even assumed to be 
continuous). 
Thus, we consider the case m = 2, S = Rnl x Rn2. Then

It is clear, that for every 
E T ( R )  
F(x) < Fr (x) Vx E S. 
For each fixed point x E S let us introduce the sets 
1 
The set C(x) is called the set of "common points". 
Let sets Zl, Z2 be such that 
Clearly, a1 U a2 = 0, a1 f l  az = 0. Hence, any distribution (Zl,Z2) of the 
common points generates the corresponding disjoint partition (al, a2) of the 
set R. 
Definition 2.1 Every such a partition (it depends upon x and, evidently, is 
not unique) is called an x-proper partition of the set R. 

AN EXCHANGE ALGORITHM FOR SUM-MIN FUNCTIONS 
217 
Let T ( R ,  x) denote the family of all x-proper partitions of the set R. Clearly, 
Besides, it is easy to see that for any r = (yl, 7 2 )  E T ( R ,  x) the relation 
holds. 
For I' = (yl,y2) E T ( R )  let us introduce the function 
@(r) 
= inf Fr (x) = inf 
CI ( X I ,  71) + inf c2 (x2, 7 2 ) .

EQUIVALENCE OF THE TWO PROBLEMS 
It will now be shown that the problem P is equivalent to the problem PI, that is 
the problem of minimizing the function F(x) on S is equivalent to the problem 
of minimizing the function @(r) 
on the set T(R). 
Let us suppose that for any a1 c R and a2 C R the functions cl ( X I ,  al) and 
c2(x2, u2) attain their minimal values on Rnl and Rn2, respectively. 
Theorem 3.1 The following equality holds: 
inf F(x) = min @(I?). 
X E S

Proof: It is clear from (2.2) that for any r = (yl,y2) E T ( R )

Let us take an arbitrary Z = (Z1, Z2) E S. For every ro = (al, c2) E T ( R ,  Z), 
the conditions (2.4) and (2.5) yield the relations

(3.5) 
The point x ( r )  = (xl(al), x2(a2)) is not unique, if the minima in (3.4) or (3.5) 
are attained at more than one point. 
Remark 3.1 Theorem 3.1 implies that the problem of minimizing the function 
F on S is reduced to the problem of solving a finite number (precisely, IT(R)I) 
of problems of minimizing the functions of the form 
where r = (al,a2) E T ( R ) .  However, since IT(R)l = 21"1, then a quite large 
number of points in the set R can annihilate the practical value of this fact. 
Here, as usual, IAI stands for the number of points in a set A. 
Thus, the problem of minimizing F on R becomes a combinatorial one (if the 
problem of minimizing Fr(x) is assumed to be an elementary one).

MlNlMALlTY CONDITIONS 
Theorem 4.1 For a point x* E S to be a global minimizer of the function

If, in addition, the functions cpi Is, i E 1 : 2, are continuous (respectively, in 
xi), then the above conditions are suJ3Cicient conditions for a point x* to be a 
local minimizer. 
Proof: Necessity Let x* be a global minimizer of the function F. Assume 
that the theorem is not valid. Let, for example, the condition (4.1) don't hold. 
Then there exists a point Z1 E Rnl such that 
Then for the point Z = (Zl, x;) E S by (4.3) and (2.2) one gets 
which contradicts the fact, that the point x* is a global minimizer of F. 
Sufficiency Let the functions cpi's be continuous in xi and the conditions (4.1), 
(4.2) hold. Then the function 
is also continuous. The continuity of the function cp with respect to x E S 
implies that 
for every ti E Zl(x*) there exists hi > 0 such that ti E Z1(x) for any 
x E B(x*, Si), 
for every t j  E &(x*) there exists ~j > 0 such that tj E &(x) for any 
x E B(x*, E ~ ) .  
Here B(x*,S) = {x E S 1 11x - x*ll < 6). 
Put 
6 = min{&, ejIti E Zl(x*), tj E ?2(x*)}. 
Thus, for all 5 E B(x*, 6) we have 
1 * 
c 1 ) 
$2 (x*) C Z2(z). 
Let us consider the sets 

220 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Now we will prove the inclusions Al C C(x*), A2 c C(x*). 
Let t E Al, then, since 
either t E Z2(x*), or t E C(x*). However, if t E Z2(x*) c Z2(2), then we have 
which contradicts the fact that Zl(3) n &(3) = 0. SO, t E C(x*), and, hence, 
Al c C(x*). Similarly we get A2 c C(x*). 
Now let us take an arbitrary disjoint partition (Zl, Z2) of the set C(Z). Since 
for the corresponding %proper partition (a1 ,a2) E T(R, Z) we obtain 
It is easy to see, that from (4.4) it follows, that El c C(3) c C(x*), and 
5 2  c C(Z) C C(x*), therefore 
and (A1 U (TI, A2 U Z2) is a disjoint partition of the set C(x*). 
So, the equalities (4.5) and (4.6) ensure us, that (al, 02) is an x*-proper 
partition of the set a, and the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied. Hence, 
the condition (4.1) implies that 
and the condition (4.2) implies that 
It follows from (4.7) and (4.8) that x* is a local minimizer of the function F. 
n 
Definition 4.1 A point x* E S satisfying the conditions (4.1) and (4.2) is 
called a stationary point. 

AN EXCHANGE ALGORITHM FOR SUM-MIN FUNCTIONS 
221 
If cpi are continuous, a stationary point is a local minimizer. The opposite is 
not true: not every local minimizer is a stationary point. 
Remark 4.1 The notion of stationary point is closely related to the necessary 
condition used. Since the conditions (4.1) and (4.2) are necessary conditions 
for a global minimum then it is natural to expect that not every local minimizer 
is a stationary point. Note, that conditions (4.1) and (4.2) are of nonlocal 
nature.

A N  EXCHANGE ALGORITHM 
Let us suppose that for every I' = (al, a2) E T(R) infima 
inf ci(xi, ai), i = 1,2, 
xi E Rni 
are attained, that is there exists a point x(r) = (xl (al), x2(u2)) E S, such that 
The following algorithm allows one to find a stationary point of the function 
F (and if pi, i = 1,2, are continuous, then the resulting point will be a local 
minimizer of F) . 
1. Take an arbitrary xO = (xp, xg) E S .  
2. Let x" 
(xF,x!j) E S have already been found. Construct the sets 
Sl(xk), S2(xk) and z(xk). 
3. Check the conditions (4.1) and (4.2) for all I' = (al, 02) E T(R, xk). 
4. If the conditions (4.1) and (4.2) are satisfied for all I? E T(R, xk) then the 
point xk is stationary, and the process terminates. 
5. Otherwise, find any rk = (a!, a;) E T(R, x" for which one of the condi- 
tions (4.1), (4.2) is violated. 
6. w 
If the condition (4.1) holds, then put ?i$ = xt. 
w 
If not, then find 35:

If the condition (4.2) holds, then put Z; = xk 
If not, then find Zi E Rn2 such that 
7. Put xk+l = (z~,z!). Go to step 2. 
Clearly, 
F(x"') 
< ~ ( x ~ ) ) .  
As a result, a finite sequence {xk} is constructed such that condition (5.2) 
holds. Since every x-proper partition (af,ag) may occur only once (due to 
(5.2)), then, taking into account the fact that IT(R)I is finite, one concludes 
that the algorithm converges to a stationary point in a finite number of steps. 
Remark 5.1 The algorithm described above may require at some steps com- 
plete enumeration of the set IT(R, xk))l = 21'(~~)l. So, in practice the algorithm 
is effective if lIc(xk)l is not very large. Theoretically, the case of complete enu- 
meration of T(R) is possible (as for every algorithm of discrete mathematics). 
6 
AN &-EXCHANGE ALGORITHM 
In this section it is assumed that cpi's are continuous. For every fixed point 
x E S and E > 0 let us introduce the sets 
The set C,(x) is called the set of "E-common points". 
Let sets 51, 6 
be such that 
Put 
a1 = 51 U 
(x), a 2  = 5 2  u UE2 (2). 

AN EXCHANGE ALGORITHM FOR SUM-MIN FUNCTIONS 
223 
It is easy t o  see, that a1 Ua2 = R ,  a1 nu2 = 0. Hence, any distribution (Zl, Z2) 
of the set of €-common points generates the corresponding disjoint partition 
(al,a2) of the set R. 
Definition 6.1 Every such a partition (it depends upon x ,  E and, evidently, it 
is not unique) is called an ( x ,  €)-proper partition of the set R. 
Let us denote by TE(R, x )  the family of all ( x ,  €)-proper partitions o f  the set 
R. Clearly, 
T ( R ,  x*) c TE(R, x )  c T ( R ) .  
Take r = (yl,y2) E T ( R )  and construct the point x ( r )  (see (5.1)). B y  
applying the exchange algorithm (described in Section 5), and taking x ( r )  as 
the initial point, in a finite number of steps we get a point x*(r) which is a 
stationary point of the function F .  
Definition 6.2 Let all cpi be continuous and E > 0. A point x* E S is called 
an €-local minimizer of the function F ,  i f  
x* is a stationary point of the function F ,  
for every (x* , E )  -proper partition 
= (a1 , a2) E T, (0, 
x*) of the set R for 
the point x*(r) (that is a local minimizer of F ,  delivered by the exchange 
algorithm with the initial point x ( r ) )  the inequality 
holds. 
Remark 6.1 Since cpi's are continuous, every stationary point is a local mini- 
mizer, the converse is not true: a local minimizer is not necessarily a stationary 
point. 
Remark 6.2 The stationarity of a point is based on the necessary condition 
(see Rem. 4.1) while the property of being an €-local minimizer depends also on 
the exchange algorithm. We will use this notion for the sake of convenience. 
Definition 6.3 A point x* E S is called a strict €-local minimizer of the func- 
tion F ,  if it is an €-local minimizer of the function F ,  and, in addition, the 
inequality (6.1) is strict, i. e. 

224 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Note that for I? E T(R, x*) the inequality (6.1) becomes the equality. 
Let us describe an algorithm for finding €-local minimizers. Let E > 0 be 
fixed. 
1. Choose an arbitrary stationary point x0 E S (constructed, for example, 
by the exchange algorithm). 
2. Let x" 
(xt, x;) E S have already been found. 
3. Construct the sets i?El(xk),3Ez(xk) and C,(X~)). 
4. Check the €-local minimality of xk (since xk is a stationary point, it 
remains to verify the condition (6.1) for all r E T,(R, xk)). 
If the point xk is an €-local minimizer, then the process terminates. Oth- 
erwise, go to step 5. 
5. Find any I'k E T,(R,xk) such that 
Such a rr, exists, since xk is not an €-local minimizer. 
6. Put xk+' = x*(rk) and go to step 3. 
As a result, in a finite number of steps an €-local minimizer is constructed. 
Remark 6.3 If e is suficiently large then an E-local minimizer is a global 
minimizer of the function F. In this case T,(R,x) = T(R), and hence i f  E is 
large, from the computational point of view, the €-exchange algorithm is not 
effective (it is equivalent to the complete enumeration of the elements of the set 
T(R)). 
If E is fairly small, the above described algorithm allows one to escape from 
a local minimum point (if the point itself is not yet an e-local minimizer).

where 
Take any

where 
Many allocation problems can be described by the above model, maybe with 
slightly different performance functionals (for example, in ? the functions cpis 
have the form cpi(t, x) = Ilt - xill). We have chosen the quadratic functions 
cpi (see (7.1)) for the simplicity reasons (since then the auxiliary problems (see 
(7.2), (7.3)) have the explicit solutions), because our main intention here is to 
demonstrate the Algorithm. 
Remark 7.1 Let 
Then for every 2 2  E Rn such that 11x2 - xi11 > 2M, the point (x;,x2) is 
stationary (that is, a local minimizer as well). Such local minimizers will be 
called trivial stationary point, and we shall ignore them, looking for better ones. 
7.1 Example 1 
Let n = 2, and fl be as shown in Table 7.1. The set fl contains 32 points in 
R2, and we have to find two clusters xi E R2 and xz E R2, which minimize the

functional 
F(x) = F(x1, 22) = C min{llti - XI / I 2 ,  llti - x21I2}, 
i E I  
where I = 1 : 32. First, let us solve the 1-cluster problem: 
Find 
min Fl(x1) = Fl(x;), 
xl€R2 
where 
It follows from (7.3) that x; = (-0.5,2.0656) and Fl(x;) = 782.2722. 
The first and quite natural idea is to take the point xO = (x? , x;) as the initial 
point for our 2-cluster problem. In this case C(xO) = R (and F(xO) = Fl(xT) = 
782.2722), and at the first step of the exchange algorithm (only to check the 
conditions (4.1) and (4.2)!!!) it is required to solve 232 elementary problems 
(which is absolutely unacceptable from practical considerations). However, it 
is sufficient to slightly perturb xO to overcome this difficulty: e.g., take To = 
(x; + z1, x;), where zl = (0,0.01). 
Applying the exchange algorithm with To as the initial point, in two steps 
we get the local minimizer T = (El, Zz), where

xy = (-1.8421,4.1316), x$ = (1.4615, -0.95385), was taken as the initial point

that the point x * ~

E = 9 at the first step the set of common points was the same as for E = 8. 
However, at further steps the increase of E affected the result, since due to 
deeper "E-diving" we were able to pick up a better-&-minimizer.

CONCLUSIONS 
Thus, we have described two algorithms: the exchange algorithm for construct- 
ing a stationary point and the &-exchange algorithm for finding, may be, a bet- 
ter minimizer. The &-exchange algorithm allows one to "escape" from a local 
minimum. These algorithms are conceptual (in the terminology of E.Polak) 
(see Polak (1971)), though in some cases (as is demonstrated in section 7) they 
are directly applicable. 
It may happen, that the number of common (or &-common points) is large. 
In such a case it is useful to perform some preliminary aggregation of these 
points reducing their number to a reasonable quantity (as well as to reduce 
or increase the value of e). The aggregation idea was proposed by Prof. M. 
Gaudioso. 
Computationally implementable modifications of the above algorithms for 
specific classes of functions will be reported elsewhere. 
At each step of the both algorithms an elementary problem of minimizing a 
function of the form Fr(x) is to be solved. The algorithms converge in a finite 
number of steps to, at least, a local minimizer. If E is sufficiently large, the 
&-exchange algorithm will produce a global minimizer, however, theoretically 
it may require the complete enumeration (and solution) of all elementary prob- 
lems. The hope and expectation are that if we take a reasonable E, then (at 
least statistically) the price asked for a fairly good local minimizer will not be 
too high. 
The case m > 2 can be studied in a similar way. Analogous results and 
algorithms can be formulated. The number of "elementary" problems becomes 
mlnl (cf. Rem. 3.1) and, of course, all calculations are more complicated. 
However, the exchange and &-exchange algorithms can be constructed.

Abstract: A review is given of the underlying theory and recent developments 
in regard to the Barzilai-Borwein steepest descent method for large scale un- 
constrained optimization. One aim is to assess why the method seems to be 
comparable in practical efficiency to conjugate gradient methods. The impor- 
tance of using a non-monotone line search is stressed, although some suggestions 
are made as to why the modification proposed by Raydan (1997) often does not 
usually perform well for an ill-conditioned problem. Extensions for box con- 
straints are discussed. A number of interesting open questions are put forward. 
Key words: Barzilai-Borwein method, steepest descent, elliptic systems, un- 
constrained optimization.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The context of this paper is the solution of the unconstrained minimization 
problem 
minimize f (x) 
x E IRn 
(1.1) 
where the number of variables n is very large, typically lo6 or so. The case of 
minimization subject to simple bounds is also considered later in the paper. A 
related problem is that of the solution of a nonlinear self-adjoint elliptic system 
of equations 
in which y = Vf is the gradient of some variational function. The case in 
which f (x) is a strictly convex quadratic function 
is also studied, which is equivalent to the solution of the linear system of equa- 
tions 
in which A is a positive definite symmetric matrix. This is referred to as 
the quadratic case and is important, not only as a model problem to analyse 
properties of methods, but also in its own right as a problem that becomes 
difficult to solve for large n, when (sparse) Choleski factorisation is impractical 
due to lack of time or storage capacity. It is the large scale situation (both for 
quadratic or non-quadratic problems) that we study in this paper. 
The methods that we study are all iterative methods, since in the quadratic 
case we cannot expect to be able to carry out enough iterations to obtain an 
exact solution, even if the theory allows this possibility, due to the size of n or 
the build up of round-off error. Early methods such as relaxation methods or 
SOR have mostly been supplanted by use of the conjugate gradient method or 
variations thereof. For the quadratic case the conjugate gradient (CG) method 
itself (Hestenes and Stiefel (1952)), or some preconditioned conjugate gradient 
(PCG) method (see for example Golub and Van Loan (1966)), is usually the 
method of choice, although there are other variants such as the minimum resid- 
ual (MR) algorithm that are also applicable to the case that A is symmetric 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
237 
and indefinite. A particular feature of these methods is that they terminate in 
at most n iterations. This is not particularly exciting when n is large, but Reid 
(1971) gives reasons why the methods are effective as iterative methods in that 
they are able to deliver a reasonably accurate estimate of the solution in sub- 
stantially fewer than n iterations, particularly if A has a favourable eigenvalue 
structure. The CG method is particularly attractive because it only requires 
4n storage locations for its implementation. PCG methods need to store and 
solve linear systems with some matrix that approximates A and makes tolerable 
demands on time and storage. 
For non-quadratic systems there are various methods of line search type 
that are based on using the search direction formula of the CG iteration. The 
simplest methods are those of Fletcher and Reeves (1964) (3n locations) and 
Polak (1971) (4n locations), the latter being more usually preferred in practice. 
These can also be preconditioned in a manner similar to the quadratic case. 
Then there are also methods that use rather more storage, such as CONMIN ( 
Shanno and Phua (1980)) (7n locations), the Limited Memory BFGS method 
(Nocedal (1980)), (9nS locations), the Truncated Newton method (Dembo, 
Eisenstat and Steihaug (1982)), and many others. 
Amongst all of these, steepest descent methods hardly rate a mention in a 
modern text-book on optimization, even though the storage requirements are 
minimal (3n locations). Indeed, the 'classical' steepest descent method with 
exact line seach (Cauchy (1847)) is known to behave increasingly badly in the 
quadratic case as the condition number of A deteriorates. Early attempts to 
modify the method led to the introduction of CG methods, with much superior 
performance. 
In 1988, a paper by Barzilai and Borwein (1988) proposed a steepest de- 
scent method (the BB method) that uses a different strategy for choosing the 
step length. The main result of the paper is to show the surprising result 
that for n = 2, the method converges R-superlinearly. Barzilai and Borwein 
also show that their method is considerably superior to the classical steepest 
descent method for one instance of a quadratic function with n = 4, but no 
other numerical results are given. Fletcher (1990) investigates some connec- 
tions with the spectrum of A in the quadratic case, and an ingenious proof by 
Raydan (1993) demonstrates convergence in the quadratic case. However, nei- 
ther of these papers gives any numerical results and the method attracted little 

238 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
attention until the seminal paper of Raydan (1997). This paper introduces 
a globalization strategy based on the non-monotone line search technique of 
Grippo, Lampariello and Lucidi (1986), which enables global convergence of 
the BB method to be established for non-quadratic functions. Of equal impor- 
tance, a wide range of numerical experience is reported on problems of up to 
lo4 variables, showing that the method compares reasonably well against the 
Polak-RibiBre and CONMIN techniques. Earlier papers by Glunt, Hayden and 
Raydan (1993) and Glunt, Hayden and Raydan (1994) also report promising 
numerical results on a distance matrix problem. The paper Glunt, Hayden and 
Raydan (1994) reports on the possibilities for preconditioning the BB method, 
and this theme is also taken up by Molina and Raydan (1996). Of particular 
interest is the possibility of applying the BB method to box-constrained opti- 
mization problems, and this is considered by Friedlander, Martinez and Raydan 
(1995) (for quadratic functions) and by Birgin, Martinez and Raydan (2000). 
The latter paper considers the BB method in the context of projection on to 
a convex set. Another recent theoretical development has been the result that 
the unmodified BB method is R-linearly convergent in the quadratic case (Dai 
and Liao (1999)). 
Despite all these advances, there is still much to be learned about the BB 
method and its modifications. This paper reviews what is known about the 
method, and advances some reasons that partially explain why the method is 
competitive with CG based methods. The importance of maintaining the non- 
monotonicity property of the basic method is stressed. It is argued that the 
use of the line search technique of Grippo, Lampariello and Lucidi (1986) in 
the manner proposed by Raydan (1997) may not be the best way of globalizing 
the BB method, and some tentative alternatives are suggested. Some other 
interesting observations about the distribution of the BB steplengths are also 
made. Many open questions still remain about the BB method and its potential, 
and these are discussed towards the end of the paper.

THE BB METHOD FOR QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS 
The theory and practice of line search methods for minimizing f (x) has been 
well explored. In such a method, a search direction dk) is chosen at the start 
of iteration k, and a step length 8k is chosen to (approximately) minimize 
f (dk) + 8dk)) with respect to 0. Then x(~+' = x(" + O~S(" is set. Usually 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
239 
s(qTy(" < 0 for a11 k (a descent method) and it is possible to guarantee 
that the method is monotonic in the sense that the sequence { f ( k ) }  is strictly 
monotonically decreasing unless a stationary point is exactly located. The 
classical steepest descent method belongs to this class, with s(" = --y(k). CG 
methods have s(l) = -y(') and s(" = --y(k) + +ks("l) for k > 1, where 
,& = y(k)Ty(k)/y(k-l)Ty("-l) in the Fletcher-Reeves (FR) method, and PI, = 
y(k)T (y(" - y("l))/y(k-l)Ty("l) in the (Polak-RibiBre) (PR) method. When 
f (x) is the quadratic function (1.3), the step Ok is readily calculated from 
the expression Ok = - ~ ( ~ ) ~ y ( ~ ) / s ( " ~ ~ s ( " ) .  
For non-quadratic functions it is in 
general only possible to find an approximate solution of the line search problem, 
and for CG methods it seems better if the solution is reasonably accurate. 
In contrast, the BB method is a fixed step gradient method, which we choose 
to write in the form 
Initially, a1 > 0 is arbitrary, and Barzilai and Borwein give two alternative 
formulae, 
and 
for k > 1, where we denote y("l) = y(k) - y(k-l). In fact, attention has largely 
been focussed on (2.2) and it is this formula that is discussed here, although 
there seems to be some evidence that the properties of (2.3) are not all that 
dissimilar. 
In the rest of this section, we explore the properties of the BB method and 
other gradient methods for minimizing a strictly convex quadratic function. 
For the BB method, (2.2) can be expressed in the form 
and can be regarded as a Rayleigh quotient, calculated from the previous gradi- 
ent vector. This is in contrast to the classical steepest descent method which is 
equivalent to using a similar formula, but with y("l) replaced by y(". Another 

240 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
relevant property, possessed by all gradient methods, and also the conjugate 
gradient method, is that 
That is to say, the total step lies in the span of the so-called Krylov sequence. 
Also for quadratic functions, the BB method has been shown to converge ( 
Raydan (1993)), and convergence is R-linear (Dai and Liao (1999)). However 
the sequences {f ( ~ ( ~ 1 ) )  
and {Ilr(x(k))l12) are non-monotonic, an explanation 
of which is given below, and no realistic estimate of the R-linear rate is known. 
However the case n = 2 is special, and it is shown in Barzilai and Borwein 
(1988) that the rate of convergence is R-superlinear. 
To analyse the convergence of any gradient method for a quadratic function, 
we can assume without loss of generality that an orthogonal transformation is 
made that transforms A to a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues diag(Xi). Moreover, 
if there are any eigenvalues of multiplicity m > 1, then we can choose the 
corresponding eigenvectors so that 
= 0 for at least m - 1 corresponding 
indices of $'). 
It follows from (2.1) and the properties of a quadratic function 
that y(k+l) = y(k) - AF)")~~ 
and hence using A = diag(Xi) that 
It is clear from this recurrence that if gIk) = 0 for any i and k = kt, then this 
property will persist for all k > k'. Thus, without any loss of generality, we 
can assume that A has distinct eigenvalues 
and that 9:') # 0 for all i = 1, 2,. . . , n. 
Many things can be deduced from these conditions and (2.6). First, if cur, is 
equal to any eigenvalue Xi, then gik+') = 0 and this property persists subse- 
quently. If both 
then it follows from (2.4) and the extremal properties of the Rayleigh quotient 
that 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
241 
Thus, for the BB method, and assuming that a1 is not equal to A1 or A,, then 
a simple inductive argument shows that (2.8) and (2.9) hold for all k > 1. It 
follows, for example, that the BB method does not have the property of finite 
termination. 
From (2.6), it follows for any eigenvalue Xi close to cxk that I ~ , ! ~ + ~ ) I  
<< lg,(")l. 
(k) 
It also follows that the values lgl 
I are monotonically decreasing. However, if 
on any iteration a k  < $A,, 
then lgik+')l 
> lgik)I 
and if a k  is close to XI then 
the ratio of ~ g i ~ + ' ) / g i ~ ) ~  
can approach A,/A1 - 1. Thus we see the potential for 
non-monotonic behaviour in the sequences {f ( ~ ( ~ 1 ) )  
and {Ilr(x(k))112), and the 
extent of the non-monotonicity depends in some way on the size of the condition 
number of A. On the other hand, if a k  is close to A, then all the coefficients gi 
decrease in modulus, but the change in gl is negligible if the condition number 
is large. Moreover, small values of cur, tend to diminish the components lgil 
for small i and hence enhance the relative contribution of components for large 
i. This in turn leads to large values of a k  on a subsequent iteration, if the 
step is calculated from (2.4). Thus, in the BB method, we see values of a k  
being selected from all parts of the interior of the spectrum, with no apparent 
pattern, with jumps in the values of f ( ~ ( ~ 1 )  
and Il-y(~(~))ll2 
occurring when a k  
is small. 
There are a number of reasons that might lead one to doubt whether the 
BB method could be effective in practice. Although a nice convergence proof is 
given by Raydan (1993), we have to recognise the fact that although both the 
CG and BB methods select iterates that satisfy the Krylov sequence property 
(2.5), it is the CG method that gives the minimum possible value of f (x("')). 
Likewise the Minimum Residual (MR) method gives the minimum possible 
value of 
Thus we must accept that the BB method is necessarily 
inferior in regard to these measures in exact arithmetic, and there is limited 
scope for the BB method to improve as regards elapsed time, for example. Also 
the possibility of non-monotonic behaviour of the BB method might seem to 
give further reason to prefer the CG method. 
To see just how inferior the BB method is, a large scale test problem is de- 
vised, based on the solution of an elliptic system of linear equations arising from 
a 3D Laplacian on a box, discretized using a standard 7-point finite difference 

242 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
stencil. Thus we define the matrices 
T =  
and 
where T is 1 x I, W is block m x m and A is block n x n where 1, m, n are the 
number of interior nodes in each coordinate direction, and are specified by the 
user. The interval length is taken to be h = 1/(1+ 1) and is the same in each 
direction. Hence the dimensions of the box are 1 x Y x Z where Y = (m + l)h 
and Z = (n + 1)h. We fix the solution of the problem to be function 
evaluated at the nodal points. This function is a Gaussian centered on the 
point (a, ,B, r), multiplied by quadratics x(x - 1) etc., that give u = 0 on 
the boundary. The parameter a controls the rate of decay of the Gaussian. 
The problem has lmn variables, and we denote u* to be the solution derived 
from (2.11) and calculate the right hand side ,6 = Au*. In our tests we choose 
1 = m = n = 100 giving a problem with lo6 variables, in which case the 
condition number of A is &/A1 
= 4133.6 = lo3.". 
We also choose u(l) = 0. 
We denote the resulting test problem to be Laplacel and choose the parameters 
in two different ways, that is 
(a) a = 2 0 ,  a = P = y = O . 5  
(b) u=50, a=0.4, P=0.7, y=0.5. 
The problem Laplacel(a) has the centre of the Gaussian in the centre of 
the box, giving the problem a high degree of symmetry. Also the smaller value 
of a gives a smoother solution. Hence this problem is more easy to solve than 
Laplacel (b) . 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
243 
The results for this problem are given in Table 2.1 below. The CG method is 
coded as recommended by Reid (1971). Times are given in seconds and double 
precision Fortran is used on a SUN Ultra 10 at 440 MHz. The iteration is 
terminated when I l y ( k ) ) 1 2  
is less than 
of its initial value. 
Table 2.1 
Double length comparison (quadratic case) 
We see from the table that there is little to choose between the CG and 
MR methods, and the elapsed time improves on the BB method by a factor of 
over 3 for Laplacel(a) and a factor of over 2 for Laplacel(b). For comparsion 
purposes, the classical steepest descent method was manually terminated after 
2000 iterations (1355 seconds), by which time it had only reduced the initial 
gradient norm by a factor of 0.18, so that not even one significant figure im- 
provement had been obtained. Thus we see that, although the performance of 
the BB does not quite match that of the CG method, it is able to solve the 
problem in reasonable time, and significantly improves on the classical steepest 
descent method. 
Nonetheless, in view of the above, we might ask if there are any circumstances 
under which the BB method might be worth considering as an alternative to 
the CG method. The answer lies in the fact that the success of the CG iteration 
depends very much on the search direction calculation dk) = - ( k )  +pks("l) 
being consistent with data arising from a quadratic model. Any deviation 
from the quadratic model can seriously degrade performance. To illustrate 
that relatively small perturbations can cause this to happen, we repeat the 
calculations of Table 2.1 using single precision arithmetic. The results are 
displayed in Table 2.2. 
We see that the CG and MR methods now take more than twice as many 
iterations for Laplacel(a), with a similar, but not quite as bad, outcome for 
Laplacel(b). The comparison in time is less marked, presumably because of

the cost savings associated with using single rather than double precision. For 
the BB method a different picture emerges. For Laplacel(a), somewhat more 
iterations are required, whereas for Laplacel(b), considerably fewer iterations 
are required. Again the time comparison is improved by using single precision, 
to such an extent that there is now little difference between the performance 
of the BB and CG methods on the Laplacel(b) problem. My interpretation of 
this is that the BB method is affected in a much more random way by round 
off errors, and small departures of -y(" and ak from the values arising from a 
quadratic problem are not necessarily detrimental. 
This has implications for the likely success of the BB method in other con- 
texts. For example, if f (x) is made up of a quadratic function plus a small 
non-quadratic term, we might expect the BB method to still converge, and 
show improved performance relative to the CG method. Another situation is 
in the minimization of a quadratic function subject to simple bounds by an 
active set or projection type of method. If the number of active constraints 
changes, as is often the case, then it is usually not possible to continue to use 
the standard CG formula for the search direction and yet preserve the termi- 
nation and optimality properties. To do this it is necessary to restart using the 
steepest descent direction when a new active set is obtained. Thus it is more 
attractive to use the BB method in some way in this situation.

THE BB METHOD FOR NON-QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS 
If the deviation of f (x) from a quadratic function is small then it may still be 
possible to use the unmodified BB method successfully. However, in general 
it is possible for the method to diverge. This is illustrated by using the test

problem referred to as Strictly Convex 2 by Raydan (1997), in which f (x) 
is defined by 
f (x) = 
hi (ex" 
xi) 
The initial point is x(l) = (1, 1, . . . , l)T and the solution is x* = 0. The 
Hessian matrix at x* is 
diag((1, 2, . . . , n) so that the condition number is n. 
It is readily verified that the unmodified BB method converges for n = 20 but 
diverges for n = 30, even though (3.1) is a strictly convex function and has a 
positive definite Hessian matrix for all x. 
It is therefore necessary to modify the BB method if it is to be used as a 
general purpose solver for non-quadratic problems. An important contribution 
is that of Raydan (1997) who suggests using the non-monotonic line search of 
Grippo, Lampariello and Lucidi (1986). In Raydan's method (the BB-Raydan 
method, say) the initial estimate of the line search step is I3 = a;', with some 
adjustment if a;' turns out to be unreasonably large or small (and I3 is required 
to be positive). An Armijo-type line search on I3 is then carried out until the 
acceptance condition 
f(x(" + d) 2 
max 
f(j) - yy(k)Td 
max(k-M,l)<j<k 
is met, where d = - ~ y ( ~ )  
is the displacement along the steepest descent di- 
rection. This allows any point to be accepted if it improves sufficiently on the 
largest of the M + 1 (or Ic if Ic 5 M) most recent function values. As usual 
y > 0 is a small preset constant, and the integer M controls the amount of 
monotonicity that is allowed. Raydan recommends the value M = 10 and 
presents a lot of encouraging numerical evidence on test problems with up to 
n = lo4 variables. His results are competitive with CG methods but he observes 
some poorer results on ill-conditioned problems. 
To obtain more insight, a non-quadratic test problem of lo6 variables is 
derived, based on a 3D Laplacian, in which the objective function is 
~ U ~ A U  
- pTu + ahZ C uek, 
i j k  
which is not untypical of what might arise from a nonlinear partial differential 
equation. This problem is referred to as Laplace2. The matrix A is that 
defined in (2.10), and the vector /3 is chosen so that the minimizer u* of (3.3) 

246 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
is the function u(x, y, z )  in (2.11), evaluated at the discretization points. The 
non-quadratic term in (3.3) includes a factor h2, and 0 5 uijk < 1 which also 
makes the utjk term small. Thus the relative contribution of the non-quadratic 
term is small, and as we shall see, the unmodified BB method is able to solve 
instances of this problem. 
The progress of various methods for solving Laplace2(b) is given in Table 
3.1. The columns headed #Is, #f and #g give the numbers of line searches, 
Table 3.1 Time (minutes) and numbers of evaluations to solve Laplace2(b) 
Problem 
function evaluations and gradient evaluations required to solve the problem. 
The calculations are carried out in double precision Fortran and the non-BB 
methods both use the same line search based on standard strong Wolfe con- 
ditions with a relative slope tolerance of 0.1. For the BB-Raydan method the 
column #Is gives the number of occasions on which the Armijo line search is 
used. In the limited memory method, 3 back pairs of vectors are stored. Ini- 
tially an accuracy tolerance of better than 
of the initial gradient norm was 
required (the column headed '6 figures' in the table) but only the BB methods 
were able to find the solution to this accuracy. Therefore the comparison is 
carried out on the basis of 5 figure accuracy 
of the initial gradient norm 
required). 
It can be seen that here the unmodified BB method actually improves on 
the PR-CG method, but that this improvement is not maintained for the BB- 
Raydan method. The limited memory BFGS method shows up worst in the 
tests. The line search for the non-BB methods is seen to be reasonably efficient

with only about two function and gradients calls per line search. The BB 
method (y only), to be described below, gives the best performance. One reason 
for the improvement of the unmodified BB method over the PR-CG method 
might be the effect of non-quadratic terms degrading the performance of the CG 
method. Another possibility is that the CG line search now requires additional 
evaluations of the function and gradient to attain the required accuracy in 
the line search. One would not like draw any firm conclusions on the basis of 
just one set of results, but these results do reinforce Raydan's conclusion that 
the BB method, suitably modified, can match or even improve on the PR-CG 
method. 
Probably the most interesting outcome to emerge is the difference in per- 
formance of the unmodified BB method and the BB-Raydan method. The 
reasons for this are readily seen by examining the performance of the unmodi- 
fied method shown in Figure 3.1. Here the difference f (k) - f * is plotted on a log 
scale against the number of iterations. A noticeable feature is the four occasions 
iteration number 
Figure 3.1 
Performance of unmodified BB on Laplace2(b) 
on which a huge jump is seen in f (" - f * above the slowly varying part of the 
graph. In particular the jump around iteration 460 is over lo5 in magnitude. 

248 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Although somewhat disconcerting, these jumps are actually very beneficial in 
that they are soon followed by a considerable overall improvement in f ( k )  - f *. 
For example, before the spike at around iterations 260-270, f (" - f * is slowly 
varying at around 1 0 - ~ . ~ ,  
whereas afterwards it is around 1 0 - ~ . ~ ,  
an improve- 
ment of two orders of magnitude. Similar improvements can be seen either side 
of the other large spikes. I think the explanation for this is as follows. Consider 
the quadratic case of the previous section and the effect of 'small' components 
of the gradient (by which I mean components gi(k) for small i) in the case that 
the condition number X,/X1 is large. In this case, large values of crk have very 
little effect on the small components, but they diminish significantly the size of 
the large components, by virtue of (2.6). Subsequently therefore, an iteration 
occurs on which the small components dominate $"I), 
and this gives rise to a 
small Rayleigh quotient for a k  (see (2.4)), which in turn causes a large increase 
in the large components of the gradient. The effect over this, possibly over 
two or three iterations, is to cause the huge spike in the graph of f ( k )  - f*. 
(A similar effect is observed if Ily(")I2 
is graphed.) However the effect of these 
iterations is to significantly reduce the relative contribution of the small com- 
ponents in the gradient, and it is only by allowing large increases in the large 
components that these small components can be eficiently removed. Gradient 
methods which do not permit non-monotonic steps, or which limit their effect, 
are only able to remove the small components slowly, and hence suffer from 
slow convergence. 
Looking at the spike around iteration 460 in Figure 3.1, this value of f ( k )  
could only be accepted by Raydan's modification for a value of about M = 200, 
corresponding to the position of the previous higher spike. Therefore we see 
that the value of M = 10 used by Raydan severely restricts the amount of non- 
monotonicity that can occur. Moreover, the test (3.2) does not allow values 
of f ( k )  that are larger than f (l) to be accepted. For Laplace2(b), the value 
of f(') - f * is about 0.94 x 
Thus we see from Figure 3.1 that many of 
the early spike values would not be acceptable, and it is only after iteration 
270 or thereabouts that there are no spike values for which f ( k )  is greater than 
f ('1. Therefore this is another feature of Raydan's modification that restricts 
the amount of non-monotonicity. The above interpretation also explains why 
the numerical results obtained by Raydan are poor for very ill-conditioned 
problems. This is because, from (2.6), the non-monotonicity effects are most 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
249 
noticeable if the condition number is very large. We have seen that the value of 
M = 10 fails to allow the very large spikes to be accepted, which, as we argue 
above, is important for avoiding slow convergence in a gradient method. 
Obvious suggestions to improve the performance of Raydan's modification 
are first to choose much larger values of M, especially if the problem is likely 
to be ill-conditioned. Another suggestion is to allow increases in f(" up to a 
user supplied value 7 > f (I) on early iterations. This is readily implemented by 
defining f (" = 7 for k < 1 and changing (3.2) so that the range of indices j is 
k- M 5 j 5 k. These changes make it more likely that the non-monotonic steps 
observed in Figure 3.1 are able to be accepted. On the other hand, although 
the convergence proof presented by Raydan would still hold, this extra freedom 
to accept 'bad' points might cause difficulties for very non-quadratic problems, 
and further research on how best to devise a non-monotone line search is needed. 
Another idea to speed up Raydan's method is based on the observation that 
the unmodified BB method does not need to refer to values of the objective 
function. These are only needed when the non-monotone line search based on 
(3.2) is used. Therefore it is suggested that a non-monotone line search based 
on llyll is used. As in (3.2), an Armijo-type search is used along the line ~ ( ~ ) + d  
where d = - ~ y ( ~ ) ,  
using a sequence of values such as 8 = 1, &, A, 
. . .. An 
acceptance test such as 
would be used, where y E (0,l) is a small constant and we denote y = y ( ~ ( ~ )  
+ 
d) and a = dT(y - y(")/dTd, which is the prospective value of a k + l  (see 
(2.2)) if the step is accepted. Also we denote 11 y(k))12 
= ij for k < 1, where ij is 
a user supplied upper limit on Ily(k)l12. The calculation shown in the last line 
of Table 3.1 is obtained by choosing M and ij sufficiently large so that Bk = 1 
for all k, and shows the benefit to be gained by not evaluating f (x). To prove 
convergence it is necessary to show that x(" + d would always be accepted for 
sufficiently small 8 in the Armijo sequence. This is readily proved if f (x) is a 
strictly convex function, as follows. Using the identity 
and a Taylor series for y(x(" + d)) about x(" we may obtain 

250 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
and hence using the binomial theorem that 
where a is defined above. It follows from the Taylor series and the strict 
convexity of f (x) that there exists a constant X > 0 such that a 2 A, and 
consequently that 
if 0 is sufficiently small. Thus we can improve on the most recent value Ily(")12 
in this case, and hence (3.4) holds a fortiori. 
4 
DISCUSSION 
One thing that I think emerges from this review is just how little we understand 
about the BB method. In the non-quadratic case, all the proofs of convergence 
use standard ideas for convergence of the steepest descent method with a line 
search, so do not tell us much about the BB method itself, so we shall restrict 
this discussion to the quadratic case. Here we have Raydan's ingenious proof of 
convergence Raydan (1993), but this is a proof by contradiction and does not 
explain for example why the method is significantly better than the classical 
steepest descent method. For the latter method we have the much more telling 
result of Akaike (1959) that the asymptotic rate of convergence is linear and 
the rate constant in the worst case (under the assumptions of Section 2) is 
(An - X1)/(Xn + XI). This exactly matches what is observed in practice. This 
result is obtained by defining the vector p(k) by 
= ((gk))2/y(k)Ty(k) in the 
notation of Section 2. This vector acts like a probability distribution for 7(k) 
over the eigenvectors of A, insofar as it satisfies the conditions p(" 2 0 and 
eTp(" = 1. Akaike shows that the components of p(" satisfy the recurrence 
relation 
and that the sequence {p(")) in the worst case oscillates between two accumu- 
lation points el and en. Here the scalar product ATp(" is just the Rayleigh 
quotient calculated from y(k) (like (2.4) but using y(k) on the right hand side). 
A similar analysis is possible for the BB method, in which a superficially similar 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
251 
Figure 4.1 
Distribution of ak values for Laplacel(b) 
two term recurrence 
is obtained. However the resulting sequence {p(")) shows no obvious pattern, 
and although it must have accumulation points, it is not obvious what they 
are (probably they include el and en, but there may well be others), and the 
oscillatory behaviour of classical steepest descent is certainly not seen. 
In an attempt to obtain further insight into the behaviour of the BB method, 
the distribution of the 1009 values of ar, obtained in Table 2.1 is graphed in 
Figure 3.2. It can be seen that a very characteristic pattern 
is obtained, with most of the ak values being generated in the vicinity of 
A,. 
The range of values is consistent with a condition number of A,/A1 
= 
It is also seen that there are very few values close to XI, and it is 
values at this end of the spectrum that give rise to the large non-monotonic 
spikes such as are seen in Figure 3.1. It is easily shown from (2.6) that any 
ak E (;An, A,) 
guarantees to reduce all components lgil, SO we see that the 
great majority of iterations cause an improvement in f ,  and only relatively few 

252 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
iterations give rise to an increase in f .  I have observed the pattern of behaviour 
shown in Figure 3.2 on a number of ill-conditioned problems, although N. Gould 
(private communication) indicates that he has generated problems for which 
the distribution of the a k  does not show this pattern. 
What we would like, and what we do not have, is a comprehensive theory 
that explains these phenomena, and gives a realistic estimate of the rate of 
convergence averaged over a large number of steps. A useful piece of information 
at any x(') would be a realistic bound on the number of iterations needed to 
obtain a sufficient improvement on the best value of f (x) that has currently 
been obtained. This for example could be used in a watchdog-type test for 
non-quadratic functions, returning to the best previous iterate if the required 
improvement were not obtained in the said number of iterations. It would also 
be useful to have a theory that relates to how the eigenvalues Xi are distributed 
within the spectrum. For example, if the eigenvalues are distributed in two 
clusters close to XI and A,, 
then we would expect to be able to show rapid 
linear convergence, by virtue of the R-superlinear result for n = 2. 
Then there is the possibility of alternative choices of the step in a steep- 
est descent method. A range of possibilities have been suggested by Fried- 
lander, Martinez, Molina and Raydan (1999), amongst which is the repeated 
use of a group of iterations in which a classical steepest descent step with 
a k  = y(k)T~y("/y("Ty(" is followed by the use of aj = ar, for the subsequent 
m iterations, j = k + 1,. . . , k + m. For m > 1, this method can considerably 
increase the non-monotonic behaviour observed in the sequences { f (x(")) and 
{Ily(~(~))11~). 
This is shown from (2.6) because term (1 - Ailak) is repeated m 
times, so that the effect of a value of a k  close to A1 is to increase large compo- 
nents Jgil by a factor close to (An/Al)m over the m iterations. Nonetheless, it 
seems overall that the effect of this modification is beneficial, and values up to 
say m = 4 can work well (Y-H. Dai, private communication). Clearly further 
study of these possibilities is called for. 
The success of the BB and related methods for unconstrained optimization 
leads us to consider how it might be used for constrained optimization. This 
has already been considered for optimization subject to box constraints, and 
we review current progress in the next section. An important advance would 
be to find an effective BB-like method for large-scale linear systems involving 

BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD 
253 
the KKT matrix 
Such an advance would be an important step in developing methods suitable 
for large scale quadratic programming, and this could lead to the development 
of methods for large scale nonlinear programming. 
5 
OPTIMIZATION WITH BOX CONSTRAINTS 
Many methods have been suggested for solving optimization problems in which 
the constraints are just the simple bounds 
(see the references in Friedlander, Martinez and Raydan (1995) and Birgin, 
Martinez and Raydan (2000) for a comprehensive review). Use of the BB 
methodology is considered in two recent papers. That of Friedlander, Martinez 
and Raydan (1995) is applicable only to quadratic functions and uses an active 
set type strategy in which the iterates only leave the current face if the norm of 
reduced gradient is sufficiently small. No numerical results are given, and to me 
it seems preferable to be able to leave the current face at any time if the com- 
ponents of the gradient vector have the appropriate sign. Such an approach is 
allowed in the BB-like projected gradient method of Birgin, Martinez and Ray- 
dan (2000). This method is applicable to the minimization of a non-quadratic 
function on any closed convex set, although here we just consider the case of 
box constraints for which the required projections are readily calculated. 
Birgin, Martinez and Raydan give two methods, both of which use an 
Armijo-type search on a parameter 8. Both methods use an acceptance test 
similar to (3.2) which only require sufficient improvement on the largest of the 
M+ 1 most recent function values in the iteration. In Method 1, the projection 
is calculated, where a k  is the BB quotient given in (2.2). Then an Armijo 
search on 8 is carried out until an acceptable point is obtained. In Method 2 
the point 
Y = P(x(" - -(")lak) 
is calculated, and an Armijo search is carried out along the line x = x ( ~ )  
+ 
e(y - ~ ( ~ 1 ) .  
Both methods are proved to be globally convergent, by using 

254 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
a sufficient reduction property related to the projected gradient. Numerical 
results on a wide variety of CUTE test problems of dimension up to about lo4 
are described. These suggest that there is little to choose in practice between 
Methods 1 and 2, and that the performance is comparable with that of the 
LANCELOT method of Conn, Gould and Toint (1988), (1989). 
There are a number of aspects in which improvements to Methods 1 and 2 
might be sought. For a quadratic function we no longer have the assurance 
that the unmodified BB method converges (in contrast to Raydan's proof in 
Raydan (1993)), so that the methods rely on the Armijo search, and so are 
open to the criticisms described in Section 3. It would be nice therefore if a 
convergence theory for some BB-type projected gradient algorithm for the box 
constrained QP problem could be developed that does not rely on an Armijo 
search. Similar remarks hold in the non-quadratic case, and any developments 
for box constrained QP problems can be expected to have implications for the 
non-quadratic case. However, it will certainly be necessary to have modifica- 
tions to allow for non-quadratic effects. Any developments for unconstrained 
optimization, of the sort referred to in Section 3, may well be relevant here. 
This could include for example the use of a watchdog-type algorithm that re- 
quires sufficient improvement over a fixed number of steps. Thus there are 
many challenging research topics in regard to BB-like methods that suggest 
themselves, and we can look forward to interesting developments in the future.

Abstract: In this paper we use a sharp Lagrangian function to construct a dual 
problem to the nonconvex minimization problem with equality constraints. By 
using the strong duality results we modify the subgradient method for solving 
a dual problem constructed. The algorithm proposed in this paper has some 
advantages. In contrast with the penalty or multiplier methods, for improving 
the value of the dual function, one need not to take the "penalty like parameter" 
to infinity in the new method. The value of the dual function strongly increases 
at each iteration. The subgradient of the dual function along which its value 
increases is calculated explicitly. In contrast, by using the primal-dual gap, the 
proposed algorithm possesses a natural stopping criteria. We do not use any 
convexity and differentiability conditions, and show that the sequence of the 
values of dual function converges to the optimal value. Finally, we demonstrate 
the presented method on numerical examples. 
Key words: Nonconvex programming, augmented Lagrangian, duality with 
zero gap, subgradient method.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years the duality of nonconvex optimization problems have attracted 
intensive attention. There are several approaches for constructing dual prob- 
lems. Two of them are most popular: augmented Larangian functional ap- 
proach (see, for example, Rockafellar (1993), Rockafellar and Wets (1998)) and 
nonlinear Lagrangian functional approach (see, for example, Rubinov (2000), 
Rubinov et a1 (to appear), Yang and Huang (2001)). The construction of 
dual problems and what is more the zero duality gap property are important 
as such the optimal value and sometimes the optimal solution of the origi- 
nal constrained optimization problem can be found by solving unconstrained 
optimization problem. The main purpose of both augmented and nonlinear 
Lagrangians is to reduce the problem in hand to a problem which is easier to 
solve. Therefore the justification of theoretical studies in this field is creating 
new numerical approaches and algorithms: for example, finding a way to com- 
pute the multipliers that achieve the zero duality gap or finding a Lagrangian 
function that is tractable numerically. 
The theory of augmented Lagrangians, represented as the sum of the or- 
dinary Lagrangian and an augmenting function, have been well developed for 
very general problems. Different augmented Lagrangians, including sharp La- 
grangian function, can be obtained by taking special augmenting functions (see, 
for example, Rockafellar and Wets (1998)). In this paper we consider the non- 
convex minimization problem with equality constraints and calculate the sharp 
Lagrangian function for this problem explicitly. By using the strong duality 
results and the simplicity of the obtained Lagrangian, we modify the subgra- 
dient method for solving the dual problem constructed. Note that subgradient 
methods were first introduced in the middle 60s; the works of Demyanov (1968), 
Poljak (1969a), (1969b), (1970) and Shor (1985), and (1995) were particularly 
influental. The convergence rate of subgradient methods is discussed in Goffin 
(1977). For further study of this subject see Bertsekas (1995) and Bazaraa et 
a1 (1993). This method were used for solving dual problems obtained by using 
ordinary Lagrangians or problems satisfying convexity conditions. However, 
our main purpose is to find an optimal value and an optimal solution to a 
nonconvex primal problem. We show that a dual function constructed in this 
paper is always concave. Without solving any additional problem, we explicitly 
calculate the subgradient of the dual function along which its value strongly

increases. Therefore, in contrast with the penalty or multiplier methods, for 
improving the value of the dual function, one need not to take the "penalty like 
parameter" to infinity in the new method. The paper is outlined as follows. 
The construction of sharp Lagrangian function and zero duality gap properties 
are presented in Section 2. In Section 3 we explain the modified subgradi- 
ent method, give convergence theorems and present the results of numerical 
experiments obtained by applying the presented method.

DUALITY 
Consider the following equality constrained optimization problem (P): 
inf 
X E X  
fo (x) 
subject to 
f (x) = 0, 
where X C Rn, f(x) = (fl(x),fi(x),..-,fm(x)) and fi : X -+ R, i = 
0,1,2, . , m, are real-valued functions. 
Let Q, : Rn x Rm -+ X be a dualizing parametrization function defined as 
fo (x) if x E X and f (x) = y, 
Q,(x,Y) = 
+oo 
otherwise. 
The function P : Rm -+ 
defined by 
is called the perturbation function, corresponding to dualizing parametrization 
Q,. The augmented Lagrangian L : Rn x Rm x R+ -+ i? associated with the 
problem (P) will be defined as 
where I I - I I  is any norm in Rm, [y, u] = ELl yiui. By using the definition of Q,, 
we can calculate the augmented Lagrangian associated with (P) explicitly. For 
every x E X we have: 
Every element x E Xo, where Xo is a feasible set defined by

such that fo (x) = inf P will be termed a solution of (P). 
The dual function H is defined as: 
H(u,c) = inf L(x,u,c), for u E Rm,c E [O,+w) 
xEX 
Then, a dual problem of (P) is given by 
(P*) 
supP* = 
sup 
H (u,c) . 
(u,c)€Rmx R+ 
Any element (u, c) E Rm x R+ with H (u, c) = sup P* is termed a solution of 
(P*). The following lemma allows us to represent the primal problem (P) as 
an " inf sup" of the augmented Lagrangian L. 
Lemma 2.1 For every u, y E Rm, y # 0 and for every r E R+ there exzsts 
c E R+ such that cllyII - [ y , ~ ]  
> r. 
It follows from this lemma that 
sup 
L(x,u,c) = 
fo (x), x E xo, 
(u,c)€Rmx R+ 
+m, 
x $ xo. 
Hence, 
inf 
sup 
L (x, u, c) = inf { fo (x) lx E Xo ) = inf P. 
(2.2) 
(u,c)€Rm x R+ 
This means that the value of a mathematical programming problem with equal- 
ity constraints can be represented as (2.2), regardless of properties the original 
problem satisfies. 
Proofs of the following four theorems are analogous to the proofs of similar 
theorems earlier presented for augmented Lagrangian functions with quadratic 
or general augmenting functions. See, for example, Rockafellar (1993) and 
Rockafellar and Wets (1998).

Theorem 2.1 inf P > sup P*. 
Theorem 2.2 Suppose that inf P is finite. Then a pair of elements 'i: E X 
and (Ti,Z) E Rm x R+ furnishes a saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian L 
on X x (Rm x R+) if and only if 2 is a solution to (P) , @,Z) is a solution to 
(P*) and inf P = sup P* . 
Theorem 2.3 A pair of vectors x E X and (u,c) E Rm x R+ furnishes a 
saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian L on X x (Rm x R+) i f  and only i f  
where p is a perturbation function defined by (??). 
When this holds, any a > c 
will have the property that 
[x solves (P)] H [x minimizes L ( z ,  u, a )  over z E X ]  . 
Theorem 2.4 Suppose in (P) that fo and f are continuous, X is compact, 
and a feasible solution exists. Then inf P = sup P* and there exists a solution 
to ( P ) .  Furthermore, in this case, the dual function H in (P*) is concave 
and finite everywhere on Rm x R+, so this maximization problem is effectively 
unconstrained. 
The following theorem will also be used as a stopping criteria in solution 
algorithm for dual problem in the next section. 
Theorem 2.5 Let inf P = sup P* and suppose that for some (Ti, E) E Rm x R+, 
and 2 E X, 
minL(x,;li,~) 
= f o ( 2 ) + E I l f  (2)II - [ f  (2),Ti].

Then Z is a solution to (P) and (Ti,E) is a solution to (P*) i f  and only i f

and therefore f (2) = 0.

3 SOLVING THE DUAL PROBLEM 
We have described several properties of the dual function in the previous sec- 
tion. In this section, we utilize these properties to modify the subgradient 
method for maximizing the dual function H. Theorem 2.2, Theorem 2.3 and 
Theorem 2.4 give necessary and sufficient conditions for an equality between 
inf P and sup P*. Therefore, when the hypotheses of these theorems are satis- 
fied, the maximization of the dual function H will give us the optimal value of 
the primal problem. 
We consider the dual problem 
maximize H(u,c) = minL(x,u,c) = min{fo (x) +cIlf (x)II - [u, f (x)])

subject to (u, c) E F = Rm x R+, 
It will be convenient to introduce the following set: 
The assertion of the following theorem can be obtained from the known the- 
orems on the subdifferentials of the continuous maximum and minimum func- 
tions. See, for example, Polak (1997). 
Theorem 3.1 Let X be a nonempty compact set in Rn and let fo and f be 
continuous, so that for any (Ti, E) E Rm x R+, X (E, E) is not empty. If Z E 
X (E, 3) , then (- f (T) ,I[ f (T) 11) is a subgradient of H at (E, i3) . 

MODIFIED SUBGRADIENT METHOD 
263 
3.1 Subgradient Method 
Initialization Step Choose a vector (ul, cl) with cl 2 0, let k = 1, and go to 
the main step. 
Main Step 1. Given (uk, ck) , solve the following subproblem: 
Let xk be any solution. If f (xk) = 0, then stop; by Theorem 2.5, (uk, ck) is 
a solution to (P*), xk is a solution to (P) . Otherwise, go to step 2. 
2. Let 
where sk and ek are positive scalar stepsizes, replace k by k + 1, and repeat 
step 1. 
The following theorem shows that in contrast with the subgradient methods 
developed for dual problems formulated by using ordinary Lagrangians, the 
new iterate strictly improves the cost for all values of the stepsizes sk and ek. 
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that the pair (uk,ck) E Rm x R+ is not a solution 
to the dual problem and xk E X (uk, ck) . Then for a new iterate (uk+l, ck+l) 
calculated from (3.1) for all positive scalar stepsizes sk and ~k we have: 
Proof: Let (uk, ck) E Rm x R+, xk E X (uk, ck) and ( u ~ + ~ ,  
c ~ + ~ )  
is a new iter- 
ate calculated from (3.1) for arbitrary positive scalar stepsize sk and ek. Then 
by Theorem 3.1, the vector (- f (xk) , I [  f (xk)ll) E Rm x R+ is a subgradient of 
a concave function H at (uk, c ~ )  
and by definition of subgradients we have: 
On the other hand 

264 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Now suppose that the last minimum attains for a some Z E X. If f (Z) were 
zero, then by Theorem 2.5, the pair ( u k ,  ck + ~k 11 f (xk) 1 1 )  would be a solution 
to the dual problem and therefore 
because of (uk, ck) is not a solution. When f (Z) # 0 then 
Thus we have established that H (uk+l, ck+l) > H ( u k ,  ck) . The following 
theorem demonstrates that for the certain values of stepsizes sk and ~
k
,
 
the 
distance between the points generated by the algorithm and the solution to 
the dual problem decreases at each iteration (cf. Bertsekas (1995), Proposition 
6.3.1). 
Theorem 3.3 Let ( u k ,  ck) be any iteration, which is not a solution to the dual 
problem, so f (xk) # 0. Then for any dual solution (;li,i?), we have 
for all stepsizes sk such that

265 
where the last inequality is a result of inequalities E - ck > 0 ,  1 1  f (xk) 
1 1  > 0, and 
0 < ~k < sk. NOW, by using the subgradient inequality 
we obtain 
It is straightforward to verify that for the range of stepsize of equation (3.2) 
the sum of the last two terms in the above relation is negative. Thus, 
and the theorem is proved. The inequality (3.3) can also be used to establish 
the convergence theorem for the subgradient method. 
Theorem 3.4 Assume that all conditions of Theorem 2.4 are satisfied. Let 
( u k ,  ck) be any iteration of the subgradient method. Suppose that each new 
iteration ( ~ k + ~ ,  
c ~ + ~ )  
is calculated from (3.1) for the stepsizes 
- 
sk = - H(uk'ck) and 0 < EI < s t ,  
5 I l f  (xk)1I2 
where H = H (E,E) denotes the optimal dual value. Then H ( u k ,  ck) - H. 
Proof: By taking sk = 
in (3.3) we obtain: 

266

which can be written in the form 
It is obvious that, the sequence {I18 - ut 1l2 + I?? - ck12} is bounded from be- 
low (for example, by zero), and by Theorem 3.3, it is decreasing. Thus, 
{lla - u t  11 + la - ck 12} 
is a convergent sequence. Hence 
On the other hand, since X is a compact set and f is continuous, ( 5  11 f (xx)l12} 
is a bounded sequence. Thus, (3.4) implies 
Unfortunately, however, unless we know the dual optimal value H (u, ??) , 
which is rare, the range of stepsize is unknown. In practice, one can use the 
ste~size formula 
where Hk is an approximation to the optimal dual value and 0 < a k  < 2. By 
Theorem 3.2, the sequence {H (uk, ck)} is increasing, therefore to estimate the 
optimal dual value from below, we can use the current dual value H (uk, ck) . 
As an upper bound, we can use any primal value fo (Z) corresponding to a 
primal feasible solution 5. 
Now we demonstrate the proposed algorithm on some examples. In examples 
3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, below, for finding an x" 
X(uk, ck), the MATLAB function 
m-file fminsearch is utilized. In all examples the stepsize parameter E~ was 
taken as 0 . 9 5 ~ ~  
and sk is calculated from (3.5) with a k  = 1.

above, the result is obtained in a single iteration, starting with the initial 
guesses xo = 0, uo = 0 and co = 0. The positivity constraints xi 2 0, 
i = 1,2,3, are eliminated by defining new variables yi, such that yZ = xi, 
and then the problem is solved for these yi s. The obtained result is x* =

Abstract: Inexact Restoration methods have been introduced in the last few 
years for solving nonlinear programming problems. These methods are related 
to classical restoration algorithms but also have some remarkable differences. 
They generate a sequence of generally infeasible iterates with intermediate iter- 
ations that consist of inexactly restored points. The convergence theory allows 
one to use arbitrary algorithms for performing the restoration. This feature is 
appealing because it allows one to use the structure of the problem in quite op- 
portunistic ways. Different Inexact Restoration algorithms are available. The 
most recent ones use the trust-region approach. However, unlike the algorithms 
based on sequential quadratic programming, the trust regions are centered not 
in the current point but in the inexactly restored intermediate one. Global con- 
vergence has been proved, based on merit functions of augmented Lagrangian 
type. In this survey we point out some applications and we relate recent ad- 
vances in the theory.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A classical problem in numerical optimization is the minimization of a general 
function with nonlinear constraints. Except in very particular cases, analytical 
solutions for this problem are not available. Therefore, iterative methods must 
be used. One of the most natural ideas is to generate a sequence of feasible 
points {xk} that satisfy the constraints and such that the objective function f 
is progressively decreased. In this way, one expects that, in the limit, a solution 
of the minimization problem will be obtained. However, maintaining feasibility 
of the iterates when the constraints are nonlinear is difficult. Usually, one 
takes a direction dk for moving away from the "current point" xk but, if the 
constraints are nonlinear, the points of the form xk+adk might be infeasible, no 
matter how small the parameter a could be. On the other hand, in the linearly 
constrained case, one can always take a "feasible direction", that guarantees 
feasibility of x" 
a d q o r  a > 0 small enough. 
The observations above imply that, when nonlinear constraints are present, 
one must be prepared to lose feasibility and to restore feasibility from time to 
time. The process of coming back to a feasible point from a nonfeasible one is 
called "restoration". Usually, it involves the solution of a nonlinear system of 
equations, perhaps underdetermined. 
The most classical restoration methods are Rosen's gradient-projection 
method Rosen (1960); Rosen (1961), the sequential gradient-restoration algo- 
rithms (SGRA) of Miele and coworkers Miele et a1 (1969); Miele et a1 (1971); 
Miele et a1 (1983) and the GRG method introduced by Abadie and Carpen- 
tier. See Abadie and Carpentier (1968); Drud (1985); Lasdon (1982). Roughly 
speaking, these methods proceed in the following way: given a feasible point xk, 
a trial point w is found satisfying a linear approximation of the constraints and 
such that the functional (or the Lagrangian) value at w is sufficiently smaller 
than the corresponding value at x? 
Since, in general, w is not feasible, a 
restoration process is necessary to obtain a feasible z k  If f (z" is not suffi- 
ciently smaller than f (x", the allowed distance between xk and w must be 
decreased. 
The main difference between the different classical methods is the way in 
which restoration is performed. See Rom and Avriel (1989a); Rom and Avriel 
(198913). In the gradient-projection method of Rosen the Jacobian of the con- 
straints is fixed at w and we seek the restored point in the orthogonal subspace,

by means of a modified Newton-like procedure. In the GRG method some (non- 
basic) variables are fixed and only the remaining "basic" variables are moved 
in order to get the feasible point. A Newton method with fixed Jacobian is also 
used for solving the resulting square system of nonlinear equations. The SGRA 
methods consider the problem of restoration as an underdetermined nonlinear 
system of equations and solve it using an underdetermined Newton method 
with damping, for which global convergence can be proved. See Figure 1.1. 
The nonlinearity of the constraints impose that restoration procedures must 
be iterative. Therefore, strictly speaking, a feasible point is rarely obtained 
and restoration is always inexact. This means that practical implementations 
include careful decisions with respect to the accuracy at which the restored 
points must be declared feasible. The tolerances related to feasibility were 
incorporated in the rigorous definition of an algorithm by Mukai and Polak 
(1978). Rom and Avriel (198913) used the Mukai-Polak scheme to prove unified 
convergence theorems for the classical restoration algorithms using progressive 
reduction of the feasibility tolerance. 
This survey is organized as follows. The main Inexact Restoration ideas 
are given in Section 2. In Section 3 we give a detailed description of a re- 
cently introduced IR algorithm and we state convergence results. In Section 4 
we comment the AGP optimality condition, which is useful to analyze limit 
points of IR methods. In Section 5 we describe the application to Order-Value 
Optimization. In Section 6 we comment the application to Bilevel program- 
ming. In Section 7 we describe an application that identifies feasible regions 
with homotopy curves for solving nonlinear systems. Conclusions are stated in 
Section 8.

MAIN INEXACT RESTORATION IDEAS 
The main drawback of feasible methods is that they tend to behave badly 
in the presence of strong nonlinearities, usually represented by very curved 
constraints. In these cases, it is not possible to perform large steps far from 
the solution, because the nonlinearity forces the distance between consecutive 
feasible iterates to be very short. If a large distance occurs in the tangent 
space, the newtonian procedure for restoring feasibility might not converge, 
and the tangent step must be decreased. See Figure 2.1. Short steps far from 
the solution of an optimization problem are undesirable and, frequently, the 
practical performance of an optimization method is linked to the ability of 
leaving quickly the zones where there is no chance of finding a solution. This 
fact leads one to develop Inexact Restoration algoritms. 
The convergence theory of Inexact Restoration methods is inspired in the 
convergence theory of recent sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algo- 
rithms. See Gomes et a1 (1999). The analogies between IR and the SQP 
method presented in Gomes et a1 (1999) are: 
1. both are trust-region methods; 
2. in both methods the iteration is composed by two phases, the first related 
to feasibility and the second to optimality; 
3. the optimality phase seeks a "more optimal" point in a "tangent approx- 
imation" to the constraints; 
4. the same type of merit function is used. 

INEXACT RESTORATION METHODS FOR NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING 
275 
However, there exist very important differences, which allow one to relate 
IR to the classical feasible methods: 
1. both in the restoration phase and in the optimality phase, IR deals with 
the true function and constraints, while SQP deals with a model of both; 
2. the trust region in SQP is centered in the current point. In IR the trust 
region is centered in the restored point. 
Because of these differences, we say that IR has a more defined preference 
for feasibility than SQP. 
A very important characteristic of modern IR methods is that we are free 
to choose the algorithm used for restoration. This allows one to exploit char- 
acteristics of the constraints, which would not be taken into account in other 
nonlinear programming algorithms. 
3 
DEFINITION OF AN IR ALGORITHM 
In this section we give a rigorous definition of the algorithm given in Martinez 
(2001). 
In this algorithm, the trust region is centered in the intermediate point, 
as in Martinez and Pilotta (2000); Martinez (1997), but, unlike the algorithms 
introduced in those papers, the Lagrangian function is used in the "tangent set" 
(which approximates the feasible region), as in Martinez (1998). Accordingly, 
we define a new merit function that fits well both requirements: one of its terms 
is the Lagrangian, as in Martinez (1998), but the second term is a nonsmooth 
measure of infeasibility as in Martinez and Pilotta (2000); Martinez (1997). 
Inexact Restoration can be applied to problems with quite general constraint 
structure but, for simplicity, we restrict here to the case "nonlinear equalities 
and bounds", which is the one considered in Martinez (2001). Every nonlinear 
programming problem is equivalent to a problem with this structure by means 
of the addition of slack variables and bounds. So, we consider the problem 
min 
f (XI 
subject to 
C(x) = 0, x E R 
where R c Rn is a closed and convex subset of R n ,  f : Rn -+ R and 
c:lRn-+IRm.

We denote C1(x) the Jacobian matrix of C evaluated at x. Throughout the 
paper we assume that V f ( x )  and C1(x) exist and are continuous in R. 
The algorithm is iterative and generates a sequence {x" c 0. The para-

The following conditions are assumed for proving convergence of the IR 
algorithm. 
Al. R is convex and compact. 
A2. There exists L1 > 0 such that, for all x, y E R, 
A3. There exists L2 > 0 such that, for all x, y E R, 
Under these conditions it can be proved that the algorithm is well defined. 
We can also prove the convergence theorems stated below. 
Theorem 3.1 Every limit point of a sequence generated by Algorithm IR is a 
stationary point of 
min 
l l c ( ~ > I l ~  
subject to 
~ < Z < U .  
Theorem 3.2 If C(xk) + 0, there exists a limit point of the sequence that 
satisfies the Fritz-John optimality conditions of nonlinear programming. 
The algorithm presented in Martinez (2001) uses a fixed r = rk for all 
k = 0,1,2,. . . In Martinez (2001) it was proved that, if Step 2 can always be 
completed, then C(xk) + 0, which implies that every limit point is feasible. 
Clearly, this is not always possible. For example, in some cases the feasible 
region might be empty. Therefore, we find it useful to show that, even when 
Step 2 is eventually impossible, one finds a stationary point of the squared norm 
of infeasibilities. The same result can be proved for most practical nonlinear 
programming algorithms. 
The optimality theorem can be improved. In fact, one can prove that a limit 
point can be found that satisfies a stronger optimality condition than F'ritz- 
John. This is called the AGP optimality condition and will be the subject of 
the following section.

AGP OPTlMALlTY CONDITION 
Consider the nonlinear programming problem 
where, for simplicity, we leave to the reader the definition of the correct 
dimensions for x, h, g. Given x E IRn and the tolerance parameter r) > 0, we 
divide the inequality constraints in three groups: 
1. N: constraints not satisfied at x, defined by gi(x) > 0. 
2. A: constraints almost active at x, given by 0 > gi(x) 2 -r). 
3. I: constraints strongly satisfied (or inactive) at x, given by gi(x) < -q. 
Clearly, if r) is very large, this set is empty. 

INEXACT RESTORATION METHODS FOR NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING 
281 
Definition 4.1 W e  define T(x), the "tangent approximation" to the feasible 
set as the polytope given by 
a(x) = {z E lRn I 
hl(x)(z - x) = 0, gi(x)(z - x) I 0 if i E N, 
gi (x) + gi(x)(z - x) I 0 if i E A}. 
Observe that x E T(x). 
Definition 4.2 The AGP (approximate gradient projection) vector g(x) is 
defined by 
g(x) = P ( x  - V f (x)) - x, 
where P(z) is the Euclidean projection of z on T(x). 
(see Martinez and Svaiter (2000)). See Figures 4.1 and 4.2. 
We say that a feasible point x* of (4.1) satisfies the AGP optimality condition 
if there exists a sequence {xk} that converges to x* and such that g ( x 9  + 0. 
The points x that satisfy the AGP optimality conditions are called "AGP 
points". It has been proved in Martinez and Svaiter (2000) that the set of 
local minimizers of a nonlinear programming problem is contained in the set of 
AGP points and that this set is strictly contained in the set of Fritz-John points. 
Therefore, the AGP optimality condition is stronger than the Fritz-John op- 
timality conditions, traditionally used in algorithms. When equalities are not 
present and the problem is convex it can be proved that AGP is sufficient for 
guaranteeing that a point is a minimizer Martinez and Svaiter (2000). 
A careful analysis of the convergence proofs in Martinez and Pilotta (2000); 
Martinez (2001) shows that Inexact Restoration guaranteeing convergence to 
points that satisfy the AGP optimality condition. This fact has interesting 
consequences for applications, as we will see later.

ORDER-VALUE OPTIMIZATION 
The Order-Value optimization problem (OVO) has been introduced recently in 
Andreani et a1 (2001). 
Definition 5.1 Given m functions fi,. . . , f,, 
defined in a domain 0 c IRn 
and an integer p E (1,. . . , m}, the ('p) order-value function f (x) is defined by 

282

X k

AGP vector: inequalities. 
where 
If p = 1, f ( x )  = min{ fi (x), . . . , fm(x)) whereas for p = m we have that 
f (x) = max{fi(x), . - .  , fm(x)). 
The OVO problem consists in the maximization of the order-value function: 
max 
f ( X I  
subject to 
x E R 
The definition of the OVO problem was motivated by applications to decision 
problems and robust regression with systematic errors. See Figure 5.1.

It has been proved in Andreani et a1 (2001) that (5.1) is equivalent to 
Stationary points of the sum of squares of infeasibilities are feasible points 
and that, although all the feasible points of this problem are Fritz-John, this 
is not a serious inconvenient for IR algorithms, due to the AGP condition. 
Finally, it can be easily verified that an obvious restoration procedure exists, 
which encourages the use of restoration methods. See Andreani and Martinez 
(2001).

BILEVEL PROGRAMMING 
The Bilevel Programming problem is 
min 
f(x,y) 
subject to 
y solves a nonlinear programming problem 
that depends on x 
(6.1) 
and 
Ordinary constraints. 
In other words:

min 
f(x,y) 
subjectto 
y m i n i m i z e s P ( x , y ) s . t . t ( ~ , y ) = O , s ( x , y ) ~ O  (6.2) 
and 
h(x, Y) = 0, g(x, y) 1 0. 
(6.3) 
We omit the dimensions of x, y, t, s, h, g in order to simplify the notation. 
Usually, the constraints (6.2) are replaced by the optimality (KKT) condi- 
tions of the minimization problems, so that they take the form 
In (6.4) we denote F(x, y) - Vyf(x, y). When F is not a gradient we 
say that the minimization of f (x, y) subject to (6.3-6.6) is an MPEC (mathe- 
matical programming problem with equilibrium constraints). The equilibrium 
constraints are (6.4-6.6). Completing the inequalities with slack variables and 
bounds, we obtain the nonlinear programming problem: 
Nonlinear programming algorithms can be used for solving (6.7-6.1 1). Since 
many of these algorithms, including IR, have the property that limit points are 
stationary points of the squared norm of infeasibilities, it is interesting to find 
sufficient conditions under which stationary points of the following problem are 
feasible: 

INEXACT RESTORATION METHODS FOR NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING 
285 
An answer is given by the following theorem (see Andreani and Martinez 
(2001)). 
Theorem 6.1 Assume that the following conditions hold: 
(i) (x*, y*, v*, w*, A*, z*) is a KKT point of (13.12)~ (6.13), (6.14); 
(ii) The matrix V,F(x*, y*) + Cf='=l 
[z*]i~;, [s(x*, y*)li is positive definite in 
the null-space of ~ r t ( x * ,  
y*); 
(iii) h(x*, y*) = 0, g(x*, Y*) < 0; 
(iv) t(x*, y) is an afine function (of y) and the functions [s(x*, y)]i are convex 
(as functions of y); 
(v) There exists c such that t(x* , g )  = 0 and s(x* , c) < 0; 
Then, (x*, Y*) is a feasible point of (6.8)-(6.11). 
Roughly speaking, the sufficient conditions are related with the convexity 
of the lower-level problem, when the MPEC under consideration is a Bilevel 
programming problem. 
As in the case of the OVO problem, no feasible point of MPEC satisfies 
the Mangasarian-F'romowitz constraint qualification and, consequently, all the 
feasible points are Fritz-John. So, it is mandatory to find stronger optimality 
conditions in order to explain the practical behavior of algorithms. Fortunately, 
it can also be proved that the set of AGP points is only a small part of the set 
of Fritz-John points. The characterization of AGP points is given in Andreani 
and Martinez (2001). Since IR converges to AGP points, we have an additional 
reason for using IR in MPEC. 
As in Nash-equilibrium problems (see Vicente and Calamai (1994)) the use 
of the optimization structure instead of optimality conditions in the lower level 
encourages the use of specific restoration algorithms.

HOMOTOPY METHODS 
Nonlinear systems of equations often represent mathematical models of prac- 
tical engineering problems. Homotopic techniques are used for enhancing con- 
vergence to solutions, especially when a good initial estimate is not available. 
In Birgin et a1 (2001), the homotopy curve is considered as the feasible set of a 
mathematical programming problem, where the objective is to find the optimal 
value of the homotopic parameter. Inexact Restoration techniques can then be 
used to generate approximations in a neighborhood of the homotopy curve, the 
size of which is theoretically justified. 
Assume that R = {x E Rn I 
C 5 x 5 u), the mapping F : R + 
Rn has continuous first partial derivatives, C, u E Rn and C < u. Then, the 
mathematical problem consists in finding x E R such that 
Homotopic methods are used when strictly local Newton-like methods for 
solving (7.1) fail because a sufficiently good initial guess of the solution is not 
available. Moreover, in some applications areas, homotopy methods are the rule 
of choice. See Watson et a1 (1997). The homotopic idea consists in defining 
such that H(x, 1) = F(x) and the system H(x, 0) = 0 is easy to solve. The so- 
lution of H(x, t) = 0 is used as initial guess for solving H(x, t') = 0, with t' > t. 
In this way, the solution of the original problem is progressively approximated. 
For many engineering problems, natural homotopies are suggested by the very 
essence of the physical situation. In other cases, artificial homotopies can be 
useful. 
In general, the set of points (x, t) that satisfy H(x, t) = 0 define a curve in 
Rn+'. Homotopic methods are procedures to "track" this curve in such a way 
that its "end point" (t = 1) can be safely reached. Since the intermediate points 
of the curve (for which t < 1) are of no interest by themselves, it is not necessary 
to compute them very accurately. So, an interesting theoretical problem with 
practical relevance is to choose the accuracy to which intermediate points are 
to be computed. If an intermediate point (x, t) is computed with high accuracy, 
the tangent line to the curve that passes through this point can be efficiently 

INEXACT RESTORATION METHODS FOR NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING 
287 
used to predict the points corresponding to larger values of the parameter t. 
This prediction can be very poor if (x,t) is far from the true zero-curve of 
H(x, t). On the other hand, accurate computing of all intermediate points can 
be unaffordable. 
In Birgin et a1 (2001) a relation between the homotopic framework for solving 
nonlinear equations and Inexact Restoration methods was established. The idea 
is to look at the homotopic problem as the nonlinear optimization problem 
min 
(t - 1)2 
subject to 
H(x,t) = 0, x E 0. 
Therefore, the homotopic curve is the feasible set of (7.2). The nonlinear 
programming problem (7.2) could be solved by any constrained optimization 
method, but Inexact Restoration algorithms seem to be closely connected to 
the classical predictor-corrector procedure used in the homotopic approach. 
Moreover, they give theoretically justified answers to the accuracy problem. 
The identification of the homotopy path with the feasible set of a nonlinear 
programming problem allows one to use IR criteria to define the closeness of 
corrected steps to the path. The solutions of (7.1) correspond exactly to those 
of (7.2), so the identification proposed here is quite natural. 
The correspondence between the feasibility phase of IR and the corrector 
phase of predictor-corrector continuation methods is immediate. The IR tech- 
nique provides a criterion for declaring convergence of the subalgorithm used 
in the correction. The optimality phase of IR corresponds to the predictor 
phase of continuation methods. The IR technique determines how long pre- 
dictor steps can be taken and establishes a criterion for deciding whether they 
should be accepted or not. 
8 CONCLUSIONS 
Some features of the Inexact Restoration framework are reasonably consoli- 
dated. Among them, we can cite: 
1. freedom for choosing different algorithms in both phases of the method, 
so that problem characteristics can be exploited and large problems can 
be solved using appropriate sub-algorithms. 

288 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
2. loose tolerances for restoration discourage the danger of "over-restoring" , 
a procedure that could demand a large amount of work in feasible methods 
and that, potentially, leads to short steps far from the solution. 
3. trust regions centered in the intermediate point adequately reflect the 
"preference for feasibility" of IR methods. 
4. the use of the Lagrangian in the optimality phase favors practical fast 
convergence near the solution. 
The above characteristics should be preserved in future IR implementations. 
It is not so clear for us which is the best merit function for IR methods. The 
one introduced in Martinez (2001) seems to deal well with the feasibility and 
the optimality requirements but it is certainly necessary to pay attention to 
other alternatives or, even to the possibility of not using merit functions at 
all, as proposed, for example, in Bielschowsky (1996); Bielschowsky and Gomes 
(1998); Fletcher and Leyffer (1997). A remarkable contribution has been re- 
cently made by Gonzaga et al(2001). 
The philosophy of Inexact Restoration encourages case-oriented applications. 
Very relevant is the use of IR methods for Bilevel Programming, because we 
think that, in this important family of problems, the strategy of using oppor- 
tunistic methods in the lower level (Feasibility Phase) could be useful. A related 
family of problems for which IR could be interesting is MPEC (Mathematical 
Programming with Equilibrium Constraints) which, of course, it is closely re- 
lated to Bilevel programming. The discretization of control problems also offers 
an interesting field of IR applications because, in this case, the structure of the 
state equations suggests ad hoc restoration methods.

Abstract: We investigate the entwined roles played by information and quan- 
tum algorithms in reducing the complexity of the global optimization problem 
(GOP). We show that: (i) a modest amount of additional information is suffi- 
cient to map the general continuous GOP into the (discrete) Grover problem; (ii) 
while this additional information is actually available in some classes of GOPs, 
it cannot be taken advantage of within classical optimization algorithms; (iii) 
on the contrary, quantum algorithms offer a natural framework for the efficient 
use of this information, resulting in a speed-up of the solution of the GOP. 
Key words: Global optimization, search, Grover's quantum algorithm.

oretical and practical interest they have generated has continued to grow from 
the first recorded instance of Queen Dido's problem (Smith (1974)) to present 
day forays in complexity theory or large scale logistics applications (see Refs. 
(Torn (1989)), (Horst (1993)), (Hager (1994)), (Floudas (1996)), and references 
therein). The formulation of almost any optimization problem is deceptively 
simple: find the absolute minimum (maximum) of a given function - called the 
objective function - over the allowed range of its variables. Sometimes, the 
function to be optimized is not specified in analytic form and must be evalu- 
ated point-wise by a computer program, a physical device, or other construct. 
Such a black-box tool is called an oracle. Of course, the brute force approach 
of evaluating the function on its whole domain is either impossible - if the vari- 
ables are continuous, or prohibitively expensive - if the variables are discrete, 
but have large ranges in high dimensional spaces. Since in general each oracle 
invocation (function evaluation) involves an expensive computational sequence, 
the number of function evaluations needs to be kept to a minimum. The num- 
ber of invocations of the oracle measures the query complexity of the problem 
and gives a fair - although by no means unique - idea of its difficulty or "hard- 
ness" (Deng (1996)). Therefore, the number of oracle invocations is one of 
the paramount criteria in comparing the efficiency of competing optimization 
algorithms. 
The primary difficulty in solving the GOP stems from the fact that the fa- 
miliar condition for determining extrema (namely, annulment of the gradient 
of the objective function) is only necessary (the function may have a maximim, 
a minimum, or not have an extremum at all !) and local (it does not distin- 
guish between local and global extrema). Indeed, the generic strategy to find 
the global minimum involves two main operations, namely: (i) descent to a 
local minimum and (ii) search for the new descent region. Usually, the former 
operation is deterministic and the latter stochastic. This strategy is marred 
by additional problems. First, descent assumes a certain degree of smoothness, 
which is not always warranted. When the dimensionality of the problem is 
large, the search of the phase space becomes more and more responsible for in- 
creasing the query complexity of the problem. Finally, after determining a local 
minimum, the algorithm is usually trapped in it and special operations have to 

QUANTUM ALGORITHM 
295 
be designed to restart the search. The "hardness" of the GOP is well illustrated 
by the following "golf course" example for which the approach described above 
seems powerless. Define the function f : [O,1] -t { O , l )  as follows: 
1 for 0 5 x 5 a - €12 
0 for a - €12 < x < a + €12 
(1.1) 
1 for a + ~ / 2  5 x 5 1. 
where a E (€/2,1 - €12). To obtain the minimum of this function, one should 
evaluate it within the E interval around the unknown number a. If this function 
is defined like an oracle (i.e., if one does not know the position of the point a), 
the probability of choosing an x within this interval is E .  For the n-dimensional 
version of this oracle, the probability becomes en, and the query complexity of 
the problem grows exponentially with n (the dimensionality curse). Of course, 
this is an extreme case, for which knowledge about the derivatives (they are 
all zero whenever defined !) would not help. This and related issues have been 
deftly discussed by Wolpert and Macready in connection with their "No F'ree 
Lunch" (NFL) theorem (Wolpert (1996)). 
In the light of the previous example, it seems that without additional knowl- 
edge about the structure of the function there is no hope to decide upon an 
intelligent optimization strategy and one is left with either strategies that have 
limited albeit efficient applicability or the exhaustive search option. 
Thus, new approaches are needed to reduce the complexity of the problem 
to manageable complexity. Recently, quantum computing has been hailed as 
the possible solution to some of the computationally hard classical problems 
(Nielsen (2000)). Indeed, Grover's (Grover (1997)) and Shor's (Shor (1994)) 
algorithms provide such solutions to the problems of finding a given element in 
an unsorted set and the prime factorization of very large numbers, respectively. 
Here we present a solution to the continuous GOP in polynomial time, by 
developing a generalization of Grover's algorithm to continuous problems. This 
generalization requires additional information on the objective function. In 
many optimization problems, some of this additional information is available 
(see below). While other required information may be more difficult to obtain 
in practical applications, it is important to understand - from a theoretical 
point of view - the role of the information in connection to the difficulty of the 
problem, and to be able to assess a priori what various information is relevant 

296

and for what. For instance, if the objective function were an analytic function, 
the knowledge of all its derivatives at a given point would allow, in principle, 
the "knowledge" of the function everywhere else in the domain of analyticity. 
However, to actually find the global minimum, the function would still have 
to be calculated everywhere! In other words, the (additional) knowledge of all 
the derivatives at a given point cannot be eficiently used to locate the global 
minimum, although in principle it is equivalent to the knowledge of the function 
at all points. In fact, to locate the global minimum, both methods would require 
exhaustive calculations.

GROVER'S QUANTUM ALGORITHM 
A quantum computation is a sequence of unitary transformations on the ini- 
tial state of the wave function, +. As such, quantum computation is purely 
deterministic and reversible. It requires the initialization or preparation of the 
initial state, the actual "computation", and the read out of the result effected 
through a measurement of the final state. If the algorithm is efficient, then, 
with probability (much) higher than 112, the measurement would collapse the 
final state onto the desired result. Computer architectures needed to imple- 
ment classical or quantum algorithm are realized in terms of gates. As opposed 
to classical gates that operate on bits taking values in the set (0, I), quantum 
gates operate on normalized vectors in a finite-dimensional complex Euclidian 
space. In principle, any quantum computer can be viewed as an assembly of 
elementary quantum gates, such as the NOT and CNOT gates. The NOT gate 
is the 2 x 2 matrix ( 
) . It acts on a qubit, q, which is the normalized 
state in a two dimensional Euclidian space,c2: 
by exchanging the level populations. The CNOT gate acts on four dimensional 
vectors in c4. Obviously, some of these vectors can be represented as a tensor 
product of two two-dimensional vectors; however other vectors ina4 cannot be 
written in this form. These latter states are called entangled states and play 
a crucial role in quantum algorithms (Nielsen (2000)). Quantum algorithms 
are (i) intrinsically parallel and (ii) yield probabilistic results. These proper-

which represents a reflection (sign inversion) of the w-component of a vector. 
At the level of the oracle, the operator I,, is implemented by (-l)f(,)(.), 
which 
does not depend explicitly on the unknown element XI, while the application 
of the operator I, is obvious, since the average state is known. We define now 
the amplitude amplification operator: 
(2.5) 
which, in the compressed, two-dimensional representation of the problem, rep- 
resents a rotation of the state vector with an angle 2a towards 1x1 >. This 
means that each application of the operator Q will increase the weight of the 
unknown vector 1x1 > (which explains the name of the operator Q) and after

roughly 
-- &&- 
-- q f l  applications the state vector will be es- 
sentially parallel to 1x1 >, whereupon a measurement of the state will yield the 
result 1x1 > with a probability very close to unity. We mention that for (and 
only for) N = 4, the result is obtained with certainty, after only one application. 
In general, if one continues the application of Q, the state vector continues its 
rotation and the weight of 1x1 > decreases; eventually, the evolution of the state 
is cyclic as prescribed by the unitary evolution. In the original, N-dimensional 
representation, the operator I, has the representation: 
Using this representation, one can show explicitly that the algorithm can be 
implemented as a sequence of local operations such as rotations, Hadamard 
transforms, etc. (Grover (1997)) 
It is easy to check that if the oracle returns the same value for all the ele- 
ments, i.e. there is no "special" element in the set E, the amplification operator 

QUANTUM ALGORITHM 
299 
Q reduces to the identity operator I and, after the required number of applica- 
tions, the measurement will return any of the states with the same probability, 
namely 1/N. In other words, the algorithm behaves consistently.

SOLUTION OF THE CONTINUOUS GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION 
PROBLEM 
Grover's search algorithm described in the previous section has been applied 
to a discrete optimization problem, namely finding the minimum among an 
unsorted set of N different objects. Diirr and Hoyer (Diirr) adapted Grover's 
original algorithm and solved this problem with probability strictly greater than 
112, using 0 ( 0 )  function evaluations (oracle invocations). 
In this article, we map the continuous GOP to the Grover problem. Once 
this is achieved, one can apply either Grover's algorithm and obtain an almost 
certain result with 0 ( n )  function evaluations. However, the mapping of the 
GOP to Grover's problem is not automatic, but requires additional information. 
Before spelling out the required information, let us revisit the "pathological" 
example (1). Without loss of generality, we can take E = 1/N and divide the 
segment [0, 11 into N equal intervals. By evaluating the function at the midpoint 
of the N intervals, we obtain a discrete function that is equal to 1 in N - 1 
points and equal to 0 in one point, which - up to an unessential transformation 
- is equivalent to Grover's problem. Direct application of Grover's algorithm 
yields the corresponding result. Of course, generalization to any dimensionality 
d is trivial. Thus, a clssically intactable problem becomes much easier within 
the quantum computing framework. We shall return to this example after 
discussing the general case. 
Consider now a real function of d variables, f (xl, xz, .. .., xd). Without re- 
stricting generality, we can assume that f is defined on [0, lId and takes values 
in [O, 11. Assume now that: (i) there is a unique global minimum which is 
reached at zero; (ii) there are no local minima whose value is infinitesimally 
close to zero; in other words, the values of the other minima are larger than 
a constant 6 > 0, and (iii) the size of the basin of attraction for the global 
minimum measured at height 6 is known; we shall denote it A. 
Then our implementation paradigm is the following: (i) instead of f (.), 
consider the transformation g(.) := (f(.))llm. For sufficiently large m, this 
function will take values very close to one, except in the vicinity of the global 

300 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
minimum, which will maintain its original value, namely zero. Of course, other 
transformations can be used to achieve essentially the same result. We calcu- 
late m such that 
= 112. To avoid technical complications that would not 
change the tenure and conclusions of the argument, we assume that A = 1/M 
where M is a natural number, and divide the hypercube [0, lId in small d- 
dimensional hypercubes with sides A. At the midpoint of each of these hyper- 
cubes, define the function h(x) := int[g(.) + 1/21 (here int denotes the integer 
part). The function h(.) is defined on a discrete set of N points, N = M ~ ,  
and takes only values one and zero; by our choice of constants, the region on 
which it takes value zero is a hypercube with side A. Thus we have reduced 
the problem to the Grover setting. Application of Grover's algorithm to the 
function h(.), will result in a point that returns the value zero; by construction, 
this point belongs to the basin of attraction of the global minimum. We return 
then to the original function f (.) and apply the descent technique of choice 
that will lead to the global minimum. If the basin of attraction of the global 
minimum is narrow, the gradients of the function f (.) may reach very large val- 
ues which may cause overshots. Once that phase of the algorithm is reached, 
one can proceed to apply a scaling (dilation) transformation that maintains 
the descent mode but moderates the gradients. On the other hand, as one 
approaches the global minimum, the gradients become very small and certain 
acceleration techniques based on non-Lipschitzian dynamics may be required 
(Barhen (1996)); (Barhen (1997)). If the global minimum is attained at the 
boundary of the domain, the algorithm above will find it without additional 
complications. 
4 
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS 
It is clear that, in general, the conditions imposed on the functions f (.) are 
rather strong, suficient conditions. However: (a) these conditions are both 
satisfied and explicitly given for the academic "golf course" example (1) and 
(b) while they do not help reduce the complexity of the classical descentlsearch 
algorithm, they make a remarkable difference in the quantum framework. 
In fact, assumption (i) is satisfied by a large class of important practical 
problems, namely parameter identification encountered e.g. in remote sensing, 
pattern recognition, and, in general, inverse problems. In these problems the 
absolute minimum, namely zero, is attained for the correct values of the pa-

rameters, matching of patterns, and fitting of output to input. Assumption 
(i) can be relaxed in the sense that the function may have multiple global 
minima, all equal to zero. Functions with multiple global minima will simply 
result in Grover problems with multiple "special" elements and can be treated 
accordingly if the number of global minima is known. 
Assumption (ii) can be replaced with the much more reasonable assumption 
that f has a finite number of local minima. This would prevent the value of any 
local minimum to be infinitesimally close to the value of the global minimum. 
Assumption (iii) is the most difficult to fulfill in practical problems. However, 
this assumption could also be relaxed with no significant performance loss, if 
more efficient (e.g. exponentially fast) unstructured search quantum algorithms 
were available. For the time being, the likelihood of exponentially fast search 
algorithms is uncertain (Protopopescu). 
Recently, Chen and Diao (Chen), proposed an algorithm which was supposed 
to achieve an exponential (as opposed to polynomial) speed-up of the unstruc- 
tured search. Unfortunately, subtle complexity hidden in one of the proposed 
steps makes this algorithm unusuitable for exponentially fast search. 
Despite their scarcity and still elusive implementation in a practical quan- 
tum computer, quantum algorithms could bring very promising solutions to 
hard computational problems. It seems likely that - like the algorithms pro- 
posed so far - future quantum algorithms will be much more "problem tailored" 
than their classical counterparts. Therefore, specific additional information is 
crucial. In general, this information may be difficult to obtain, but - as il- 
lustrated above - its benefits may significantly outweigh its cost. Indeed, for 
very high dimensional, computationally intensive problems, even the polyno- 
mial reduction of complexity offered by the Grover's algorithm is extremely 
significant.

Abstract: We introduce two classes of methods for constrained smooth non- 
linear programming that are widely used in practice and that are known under 
the names SQP for sequential quadratic programming and SCP for sequential 
convex programming. In both cases, convex subproblems are formulated, in the 
first case a convex quadratic programming problem, in the second case a convex 
and separable nonlinear program. An augmented Lagrangian merit function can 
be applied for stabilization and for guaranteeing convergence. The methods are 
outlined in a uniform way, convergence results are cited, and the results of a 
comparative performance evaluation are shown based on a set of 306 standard 
test problems. In addition a few industrial applications and case studies are 
listed that are obtained for the two computer codes under consideration, i.e., 
NLPQLP and SCPIP. 
Key words: Sequential quadratic programming, SQP, sequential convex pro- 
gramming, SCP, global convergence, augmented Lagrangian merit function,

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Whenever a mathematical model is available to simulate a real-life application, 
a straightforward idea is to apply mathematical optimization algorithms for 
minimizing a so-called cost function subject to constraints. 
A typical example is the minimization of the weight of a mechanical structure 
under certain loads and constraints for admissible stresses, displacements, or 
dynamic responses. Highly complex industrial and academic design problems 
are solved today by means of nonlinear programming algorithms without any 
chance to get equally qualified results by traditional empirical approaches. 
We consider the smooth, constrained optimization problem to minimize a 
scalar objective function f (x) under nonlinear inequality constraints, 
where z is an n-dimensional parameter vector, and the vector-valued function 
g(x) defines m inequality constraints, g(x) = (gl(x), . . . , g , ( ~ ) ) ~ .  To facilitate 
the subsequent analysis, upper and lower bounds are not handled separately, 
i.e., they are considered as general inequality constraints, and there are no 
equality constraints. They would be linearized in both situations we are inves- 
tigating and would not lead to any new insight. We assume that the feasible 
domain of (1.1) is non-empty and bounded. 
Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods are very well known and 
are considered as the standard general purpose algorithms for solving smooth 
nonlinear optimization problems, at least under the following assumptions: 
The problem is not too big. 
The functions and gradients can be evaluated with sufficiently high pre- 
cision. 
The problem is smooth and well-scaled. 
SQP methods have their roots in unconstrained optimization, and can be 
considered as extensions of quasi-Newton methods by taking constraints into 
account. The basic idea is to establish a quadratic approximation based on sec- 
ond order information, with the goal to achieve a fast local convergence speed. 
A quadratic approximation of the Lagrangian is formulated and the constraints 

SQP VERSUS SCP METHODS 
307 
are linearized. Second order information about the Hessian of the Lagrangian 
is updated by a quasi-Newton formula. The convex quadratic program must be 
solved in each iteration step by an available black box solver. For a review, see 
for example Stoer (1985) and Spellucci (1993) or any textbook about nonlinear 
programming. 
Despite of the success of SQP methods, another class of efficient optimization 
algorithm was proposed by engineers mainly, where the motivation is found 
in mechanical structural optimization. The first method is known under the 
name CONLIN or convex linearization, see Fleury and Braibant (1986) and 
Fleury (1989), and is based on the observation that in some special cases, 
typical structural constraints become linear in the inverse variables. Although 
this special situation is rarely observed in practice, a suitable substitution by 
inverse variables depending on the sign of the corresponding partial derivatives 
and subsequent linearization is expected to linearize constraints somehow. 
More general convex approximations are introduced by Svanberg (1987) 
known under the name moving asymptotes (MMA). The goal is always to 
construct convex and separable subproblems, for which efficient solvers are 
available. Thus, we denote this class of methods by SCP, an abbreviation 
for sequential convex programming. The resulting algorithm is very efficient 
for mechanical engineering problems, if there are many constraints, if a good 
starting point is available, and if only a crude approximation of the optimal 
solution needs to be computed because of certain side conditions, for example 
calculation time or large round-off errors in objective function and constraints. 
In other words, SQP methods are based on local second order approxi- 
mations, whereas SCP methods are applying global approximations. Some 
comparative numerical tests of both approaches are available for mechanical 
structural optimization, see Schittkowski et al. (1994). The underlying finite 
element formulation uses the software system MBB-LAGRANGE (Kneppe et 
al. (1987)). However we do not know of any direct comparisons of computer 
codes of both methods for more general classes of test problems, particularly 
for standard benchmark examples. 
Thus, the purpose of the paper can be summarized as follows. First we 
outline a general framework for stabilizing the algorithms under consideration 
by a line search. Merit function is the augmented Lagrangian function, where 
violation of constraints is penalized in the Lz-norm. SQP and SCP methods 

308 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
are introduced in the two subsequent sections, where we outline some common 
ideas and some existing convergence results. Section 5 shows the results of 
comparative numerical experiments based on the 306 test examples of the test 
problem collections of Hock and Schittkowski (1981) and Schittkowski (1987a). 
The two computer codes under investigation, are the SQP subroutine NLPQLP 
of Schittkowski (2001) and the SCP routine SCPIP of Zillober (2001c), Zillober 
(2002). To give an impression on the convergence of the algorithms in case of 
structural design optimization, we repeat a few results of the comparative study 
Schittkowski et al. (1994). A couple of typical industrial applications and case 
studies are found in Section 6, to show the complexity of modern optimization 
problems, for which reliable and efficient software is needed. 
2 
A GENERAL FRAMEWORK 
The fundamental tool for deriving optimality conditions and optimization al- 
gorithms is the Lagrange function 
defined for all x E Rn and u = (ul,. . . , 
E Rm. The purpose of L(x, u) 
is to link objective function f (x) and constraints g(x). The variables in u are 
called the Lagrangian multipliers of the nonlinear programming problem (1.1). 
Especially, the necessary Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions 
are easily formulated by the equations 
Since we assume that (1.1) is nonconvex and nonlinear in general, the basic 
idea is to replace (1.1) by a sequence of simpler problems. Starting from an 
initial design vector xo E Rn and an initial multiplier estimate uo E Rm, iter- 
ates xk E Rn and uk E Rm are computed successively by solving subproblems 
of the form 

SQP VERSUS SCP METHODS 
309 
Let yk be the optimal solution and vk the corresponding Lagrangian multiplier 
of (2.3). A new iterate is computed by 
where ak is a steplength parameter discussed subsequently. 
Simpler means in this case that the subproblem is solvable by an available 
black box technique, more or less independently from the underlying model 
structure. In particular, it is assumed that the numerical algorithm for solving 
(2.3) does not require any additional function or gradient evaluations of the 
original functions f (x) and gj(x), j = 1, . . ., m. The approach indicates also 
that we are looking for a simultaneous approximation of an optimal solution 
x* and of the corresponding multiplier u*. 
Now we summarize the requirements to describe at least the SQP and SCP 
algorithms in a uniform manner: 
1. (2.3) is strictly convex and smooth, i.e. the functions fk(x) and gf(x) are 
twice continuously differentiable, j = 1, . . ., m. 
3. The search direction (yk - xk, vk - uk) is a descent direction for an aug- 
mented Lagrangian merit function introduced below. 
4. The feasible domain of (2.3) is bounded. 
Strict convexity of (2.3) means that the objective function f y x )  is strictly 
convex and that the constraints gf(x) are convex functions for all iterates k and 
j = 1, . . ., m. If the feasible domain is non-empty, (2.3) has a unique solution 
yk E IRn with Lagrangian multiplier vk E IRm. 
A further important consequence is that if yk = xr, at least conceptually, 
then xk and vk solve the general nonlinear programming problem (1.1) in the 
sense of a stationary solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions 

310 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
for the subproblem are given by 
with corresponding Lagrangian 
If yk = xk, the current iterate xk is feasible, and satisfies the complementary 
slackness condition g ( ~ k ) ~ v k  
= gk(yk)Tvk = 0 as well as the stationary condi- 
tion V,L(xk,vk) = v,L'(Y~, vk) = 0. In other words, the pair xk and vk is a 
stationary point of (1.1). 
A line search is introduced to stabilize the solution process, particularly 
helpful when starting from a bad initial guess. We are looking for an a k ,  see 
(2.4), 0 < a k  5 1, so that a step along a merit function *,+(a) from the current 
iterate to the new one becomes acceptable. The idea is to penalize the Lagrange 
function in the L2 norm, as soon as constraints are violated, by defining 
and we set 
where J = { j  : gj(x) 2 --uj/rj) and K = {I,. . . , m) \ J define the constraints 
considered as active or inactive, respectively. 
The steplength parameter a k  is required in (2.4) to enforce global conver- 
gence of the optimization method, i.e. the approximation of a point satisfying 
the necessary Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions when starting from 
arbitrary initial values, e.g. a user-provided xo E Rn and uo = 0. The merit 
function defined by (2.7) is also called augmented Lagrange function, see for 
example Rockafellar (1974). The corresponding penalty parameter r k  at the 
k-th iterate that controls the degree of constraint violation, must be chosen 
carefully to guarantee a descent direction of the merit function, so that the line

search is well-defined, 
The line search consists of a successive reduction of a starting at 1, usually 
combined with a quadratic interpolation, until a sufficient decrease condition 
is obtained, 0 < v < 0.5 arbitrarily chosen. To prove convergence, however, we 
need a stronger estimate typically of the form 
with p > 0, which is satisfied for SQP and SCP methods, see Schittkowski 
(1981a), Schittkowski (198313) or Zillober (1993), respectively. A more general 
framework is introduced in Schittkowski (1985a). For a more detailed discussion 
of line search and different convergence aspects see Ortega and Rheinboldt 
(1970). 
If the constraints of (2.3) become inconsistent, it is possible to introduce 
an additional variable and to modify objective function and constraints, for 
example in the simplest form 
The penalty term pk is added to the objective function to reduce the influence 
of the additional variable yn+l as much as possible. The index k implies that 
this parameter also needs to be updated during the algorithm. It is obvious 
that (2.12) does always possess a feasible solution.

SQP METHODS 
Sequential quadratic programming or SQP methods belong to the most power- 
ful nonlinear programming algorithms we know today for solving differentiable 
nonlinear programming problems of the form (1.1). The theoretical background 
is described e.g. in Stoer (1985) in form of a review, or in Spellucci (1993) in 
form of an extensive text book. il?rom the more practical point of view, SQP 

312 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
methods are also introduced in the books of Papalambros and Wilde (2000) 
or Edgar and Himmelblau (1988). Their excellent numerical performance is 
tested and compared with other methods in Schittkowski (1980), Schittkowski 
(1983a), and Hock and Schittkowski (1981), and since many years they belong 
to the most frequently used algorithms to solve practical optimization problems. 
The basic idea is to formulate and solve a quadratic programming subprob- 
lem in each iteration which is obtained by linearizing the constraints and ap- 
proximating the Lagrange function (2.1) quadratically. 
To formulate the quadratic programming subproblem, we proceed from given 
iterates xk E Rn, an approximation of the solution, uk E Rm an approximation 
of the multipliers, and Bk E RnXn, 
an approximation of the Hessian of the 
Lagrange function in a certain sense. Then we obtain subproblem (2.3) by 
defining 
It is immediately seen that the requirements of the previous section for (2.3) 
are satisfied. The key idea is to approximate also second order information 
to get a fast final convergence speed. The update of the matrix Bk can be 
performed by standard quasi-Newton techniques known from unconstrained 
optimization. In most cases, the BFGS-method is applied, see Powell (1978a), 
Powell (1978b), or Stoer (1985). Starting from the identity or any other positive 
definite matrix Bo, the difference vectors 
are used to update Bk in the form 
where 
The above formula yields a positive definite matrix Bk+l provided that Bk 
is positive definite and qTwk > 0. A simple modification of Powell (1978a) 
guarantees positive definite matrices even if the latter condition is violated. 

SQP VERSUS SCP METHODS 
313 
Among the most attractive features of sequential quadratic programming 
methods is the superlinear convergence speed in the neighborhood of a solution, 
i.e. 
lI~k+l - %*I1 < ykllxk - x*11 
(3.5) 
with yk -+ 0. 
The motivation for the fast convergence speed of SQP methods is based on 
the following observation: An SQP method is identical to Newton's method 
to solve the necessary optimality conditions (2.2), if Bk is the Hessian of the 
Lagrange function at xk and uk and if we start sufficiently close to a solution. 
The statement is easily derived in case of equality constraints only, but holds 
also for inequality restrictions. 
In fact there exist numerous theoretical convergence results in the literature, 
see for example Spellucci (1993). In the frame of our discussion, we consider 
the global convergence behaviour, i.e., the question, whether the SQP method 
converges when starting from an arbitrary initial point. Suppose that the aug- 
mented Lagrangian merit function (2.7) is implemented as merit function and 
that the corresponding penalty parameters that control the degree of constraint 
violation are determined in the way 
r k  = max 
211vk - uk1I2 
( (Y* - ~ r ) ~ B ~ ( y t  
- xk) , Tk-1 
for the augmented Lagrangian function (2.7), see Schittkowski (1983a). More- 
over we need an additional assumption concerning the choice of the matrix 
Bk, if we neglect the special update mechanism shown in (3.3). We require 
that the eigenvalues of the matrices Bk remain bounded away from 0, i.e. that 
(yk - x ~ ) ~ B ~ ( Y ~  
- xk) > 711 yk - xk 112 for a11 k and a y > 0. If the iteration 
data {(xk, uk, Bk)) are bounded, then it can be shown that there is an accumu- 
lation point of {(xk, uk)) satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (2.2) 
for (1.1), see Schittkowski (1983a). 
The statement is quite weak, but without any further information about 
second derivatives, we cannot guarantee that the approximated point is indeed 
a local minimizer. iFrom the practical point of view, we need a finite stopping 
criterion based on the optimality conditions for the subproblem, see (2.5), based 
on a suitable tolerance E > 0. For example, we could try to test the KKT 
condition 

314 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
together with sufficient feasibility and complementary slackness satisfaction. 
The above convergence result ensures that the stopping conditions are satisfied 
after a finite number of iterations. It should be noted, however, that imple- 
mented criteria are much more complex and sophisticated, see for example 
Schittkowski (l985b). 
There remain a few final comments to summarize the most interesting fea- 
tures of SQP methods: 
Linear constraints and bounds of variables remain satisfied. 
In case of n active constraints, the SQP method behaves like Newton's 
method for solving the corresponding system of equations, i.e., the local 
convergence speed is even quadratically. 
The algorithm is globally convergent and the local convergence speed is 
superlinear. 
A simple reformulation allows the efficient solution of constrained nonlin- 
ear least squares problems, see Schittkowski (1988), Schittkowski (1994), 
or Schittkowski (2002). 
A large number of constraints can be treated by an active set strategy, 
see Schittkowski (1992). In particular, the computation of gradients for 
inactive restrictions can be omitted. 
There exists a large variety of different extensions to solve also large scale 
problems, see Gould and Toint (2000) for a review.

SCP METHODS 
Sequential convex programming methods are developed mainly for mechanical 
structural optimization. The first approach of Fleury and Braibant (1986) and 
Fleury (1989) is known under the name convex linearization (CONLIN), and 
exploits the observation that in some special cases, typical structural constraints 
become linear in the inverse variables. 
To illustrate this motivation, we consider the most simple example, two bars 
fixed at a wall and connected at the other end. An external load p is applied 
at this node, see Figure 4.1. The two design variables are the cross sectional 
areas ai scaled by elasticity modulus E and length li, i = 1,2, i.e., si = Eai/li. 

SQP VERSUS SCP METHODS 
315 
Figure 4.1 
2-bar-truss. 
If si and ci denote the sinus and co-sinus function values of the corresponding 
angles of the trusses, i = 1,2, the horizontal and vertical displacements are 
given in the form 
~ ( x )  
= lpl(sin$~(c?/xz + ~ g / x i )  - COS$J(S~C~/XZ + ~ z ~ z / x ~ ) ) / s i n ~ ( $ l  
- $2) . 
If we assume now that our optimization problem consists of minimizing the 
weight of the structure under some given upper bounds for these displacements, 
we get nonlinear constraints that are linear in the reciprocal design variables. 
Although this special situation is always found in case of statically determi- 
nate structures, it is rarely observed in practice. However, a suitable substi- 
tution by inverse variables depending on the sign of the corresponding partial 
derivatives and subsequent linearization is expected to linearize constraints 
somehow. 
For the CONLIN method, Nguyen et al. (1987) gave a convergence proof 
but only for the case that (1.1) consists of a concave objective function and 
concave constraints which is of minor practical interest. They showed also 
that a generalization to non-concave constraints is not possible. More general 
convex approximations are introduced by Svanberg (1987) known under the 
name method of moving asymptotes (MMA). The goal is always to construct 
nonlinear convex and separable subproblems, for which efficient solvers are 
available. Using the flexibility of the asymptotes which influence the curvature 
of the approximations, it is possible to avoid the concavity assumption. 

316 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Given an iterate xk, the model functions of (1.1), i.e., f and gj, are approxi- 
mated by functions f k  and gt at xk, j = 1, . . ., m. The basic idea is to linearize 
f and gj with respect to transformed variables (u," - xi)-' and (xi - LF)-' 
depending on the sign of the corresponding first partial derivative. u," and L! 
are reasonable bounds and are adapted by the algorithm after each successful 
step. Also several other transformations have been developed in the past. 
The corresponding approximating functions that define subproblem (2.3), 
are 
j = 1, . . ., m, where y = (yl, . . . , Y,)~. The index sets are defined by 
In a similar way, ~h 
and IJ< are defined. The coefficients ajk and Ptj, j = 0, . . ., 
m are chosen to satisfy the requirements of Section 2.1, i.e., that (2.3) is convex 
and that (2.3) is a first order approximation of (1.1) at xk. By an appropriate 
regularization of the objective function, strict convexity of f '(x) is guaranteed, 
see Zillober (2001a). As shown there, the search direction (yk -xk, vk -uk) is a 
descent direction for the augmented Lagrangian merit function. If the adoption 
rule for the parameters L: and U," fulfills the conditions that the absolute value 
of their difference to the corresponding component of the current iteration point 
xk is uniformly bounded away from 0 and that their absolute value is bounded, 
global convergence can be shown for the SCP method if a similar update rule 
for the penalty parameters r k  as (3.6) is applied. 
The choice of the asymptotes L! 
and u,", is crucial for the computational 
behavior of the method. If additional lower bounds xl and upper bounds xu 
on the variables are given, an efficient update scheme for the i-th coefficient, 
i = 1, . . ., n, and the k-th iteration step is given as follows: 

SQP VERSUS SCP METHODS 
317 
A suitable choice of the constants is X1 = 0.5, X2 = 1.15, X3 = 0.7. If there is 
no change in the sign of a component of two successive iterations, this situation 
is interpreted as smooth convergence and allows a relaxation of the asymptotes. 
If there are changes of the sign in two successive iterations, we are afraid of 
cycling. The asymptotes are chosen closer to the iteration point leading to 
more conservative approximations. 
Additional safeguards ensure the compatibility of this procedure with the 
overall scheme and guarantee global convergence. A small positive constant is 
introduced to avoid that the difference between the asymptotes and the current 
iteration point becomes too small. However, these safeguards are rarely used 
in practice, see Zillober (2001a) for more details. 
For the first SCP codes, the convex and separable subproblems are solved 
very efficiently by a dual approach, where dense linear systems of equations with 
m rows and columns are solved, cf. Svanberg (1987) or Fleury (1989). Recently, 
an interior point method for the solution of the subproblems is proposed by 
Zillober (2001b). The advantage is to formulate either n x n or m x m linear 
systems of equations leading to a more flexible treatment of large problems. 
The resulting algorithm is very efficient especially for large scale mechanical 
engineering problems, and sparsity patterns of the original problem data can 
be exploited. 
To summarize, the most important features of SCP methods are: 
Linear constraints and bounds of variables remain satisfied. 
The algorithm is globally convergent. 
As for SQP methods, a large number of constraints can be treated by an 
active set strategy, see Zillober (2001c), Zillober (2002). In particular, 
the computation of gradients for inactive restrictions can be omitted. 

318 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Large scale problems can be handled more flexible by different variations 
of the solution procedure for the subproblem, see Zillober et al. (2002) 
for test results with up to lo6 variables. 
Sparsity in the problem data can be exploited, see again Zillober et al. 
(2002) for a series of numerical results for elliptic control problems.

COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
Our numerical tests use all 306 academic and real-life test problems published 
in Hock and Schittkowski (1983) and in Schittkowski (1987a). Part of them 
are also available in the CUTE library, see Bongartz et al. (1995). The dis- 
tribution of the dimension parameter n, the number of variables, is shown in 
Figure 5.1. We see, for example, that about 270 of 306 test problems have not 
more than 10 variables. In a similar way, the distribution of the number of 
constraints is shown in Figure 5.2. The test problems possess also nonlinear 
equality constraints and additional lower and upper bounds for the variables. 
The two codes under consideration, NLPQLP and SCPIP, are able to solve 
more general problems 
min f (x) 
with smooth functions h(x) = (hl,. . . , h,,)T 
and xl < xu. 
Since analytical derivatives are not available for all problems, we approxi- 
mate them numerically. The test examples are provided with exact solutions, 
either known from analytical solutions or from the best numerical data found so 
far. The Fortran codes are compiled by the Compaq Visual Fortran Optimizing 
Compiler, Version 6.5, under Windows 2000, and executed on a Pentium IV 
processor with 1.0 GHz. Since the calculation times are very short, about 10 sec 
for solving all 306 test problems with high order derivative approximations, we 
count only function and gradient evaluations. This is a realistic assumption, 
since for the practical applications in mind calculation times for evaluating 
model functions dominate and the numerical efforts within an optimization 
code are negligible.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
First we need a criterion to decide, whether the result of a test run is con- 
sidered as a successful return or not. Let E > 0 be a tolerance for defining the 
relative accuracy, xk the final iterate of a test run, and x* the supposed exact 
solution known from the two test problem collections. Then we call the output 
a successful return, if the relative error in the objective function is less than E 
and if the maximum constraint violation is less than c2, i.e., if 
or 
f (xk) < E , if f (x*) = 0 
where 11.. .I[, denotes the maximum norm and gj(xk)+ = max(O,gj(xk)). 
We take into account that a code returns a solution with a better func- 
tion value than the known one, subject to the error tolerance of the allowed 
constraint violation. However, there is still the possibility that an algorithm 
terminates at a local solution different from the one known in advance. Thus, 
we call a test run a successful one, if the internal termination conditions are 
satisfied subject to a reasonably small tolerance (IFAIL=O), and if in addition 
to the above decision, 
and 
T ( x ~ )  < e2 . 
For our numerical tests, we use E = 0.01, i.e., we require a final accuracy of one 
per cent. Gradients are approximated by a fourth-order difference formula 
d 
- f ( ~ ) ~ ~ ( 2 ~ ( ~ - 2 ~ e ~ ) - 1 6 f ( x - ~ e i ) + 1 6 f ( x + q i e i ) - 2 f ( ~ + 2 ~ e i )

SCPIP 
The Fortran implementation of the SQP method introduced in Section 3, is 
called NLPQLP, see Schittkowski (2001). The code represents the most recent 
version of NLPQL which is frequently used in academic and commercial institu- 
tions, see Schittkowski (198513). NLPQLP is prepared to run also under distrib- 
uted systems, but behaves in exactly the same way as the previous version, if 
the number of simulated processors is set to one. Functions and gradients must 
be provided by reverse communication and the quadratic programming sub- 
problems are solved by the primal-dual method of Goldfarb and Idnani (1983) 
based on numerically stable orthogonal decompositions. NLPQLP is executed 
with termination accuracy ACC=10-* and a maximum number of iterations 
MAXIT=500. 
The SCP method has been implemented in Fortran and is called SCPIP, see 
Zillober (2001~) and Zillober (2002). The convex subproblems are solved by 
the predictor-corrector interior point method described in Zillober (2001b). All 
input variables have been chosen such that the calling conventions for SCPIP 
and NLPQLP are comparable. 
Table 5.1 shows 
the percentage of successful test runs NSUCC, 
the average number of function calls NF, 
the average number of iterations NIT. 
When evaluating NF, we count each single function call. However, function 
evaluations needed for gradient approximations, are not counted. Their average 
number is 4 x NIT. 
Many test problems are unconstrained or possess a highly nonlinear objective 
function preventing SCP from converging as fast as SQP methods. Moreover, 
bounds are often set far away from the optimal solution, leading to initial 
asymptotes too far away from the region of interest. Since SCP methods do 

322 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
not possess fast local convergence properties, SCPIP needs more iterations and 
function evaluations in the neighborhood of a solution. 
The situation is different in mechanical structural optimization, where the 
SCP methods have been invented. In the numerical study of Schittkowski et al. 
(1994), 79 finite element formulations of academic and practical problems are 
collected based on the simulation package MBB-LAGRANGE, see Kneppe et 
al. (1987). The maximum number of variables is 144 and a maximum number 
of constraints 1020 without box-constraints. NLPQL, see Schittkowski (1985b), 
and MMA, former versions of NLPQLP and SCPIP, respectively, are among 
the 11 optimization algorithms under consideration. To give an impression on 
the behavior of SQP versus MMA, we repeat some results of Schittkowski et al. 
(1994), see Table 5.2. We compare the performance with respect to percentage 
of successful test runs (NSUCC), number of function calls (NF), and number 
of iterations (NIT), respectively. 
For the evaluation of performance indices by the priority theory of Saaty, 
see Schittkowski et al. (1994). The main difficulty is that the optimization 
algorithms solve only a certain subset of test problems successfully, which differs 
from code to code. Thus, mean values of a performance criterion are evaluated 
only pairwise over the set of successfully solved test problems of two algorithms, 
and then compared in form of a matrix. The decision whether the result of a 
test run is considered as a successful one or not, depends on a tolerance E which 
is set to E = 0.01 and E = 0.00001, respectively.

The figures of Table 5.2 represent the scaled relative performance when com-

NLPQL requires about twice as many gradient evaluations or iterations, re- 
spectively, as MMA. When requiring a higher termination accuracy, however, 

SQP VERSUS SCP METHODS

NLPQL needs only about 30 % as many gradient calls. On the other hand, 
NLPQL is a bit more reliable than MMA.

SOME ACADEMIC AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS 
A few typical academic and commercial applications of the SQP algorithm 
NLPQL are 
mechanical structural optimization, for example airplane and space struc- 
tures, Kneppe et al. (1987), 
optimal feed control of tubular chemical reactors, Birk et al. (1999), 
design of surface acoustic wave filters for signal processing, Biinner et al. 
(2002), 
design of horn radiators for satellite communication, Hartwanger et al. 
(2000), 
modeling of maltodextrin DE12 drying process in a convection oven, Frias 
et al. (2001), 
fitting drug dissolution measurements of immediate release solid dosage, 
Loth et al. (2001), 
diffusion and concurrent metabolism in cutaneous tissue, Boderke et al. 
(2000). 
In some cases, the underlying simulation software is highly complex and devel- 
oped over many years, in some others NLPQL is used in a special way to solve 
data fitting problems. 
Typical applications of the SCP code SCPIP are 
a 
minimum weight of a cruise ship, Zillober and Vogel (2000a), 
minimum weight of an exhaust pipe in truck design, Zillober (2001b), 
optimal design of the bulk head of an aircraft, Zillober and Vogel(2000b), 
optimal construction of supporting tub in automotive industry, Zillober 
(2001b), 
a 
topology design of mechanical structures, see below. 

324 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
To give an impression about the capabilities of an SCP implementation for 
solving very large scale nonlinear programming problems, we consider topology 
optimization. Given a predefined domain in the 2D/3D space with boundary 
conditions and external load, the intention is to distribute a percentage of the 
initial mass on the given domain such that a global measure takes a minimum, 
see Bendsere (1995) for a broad introduction. The so-called power law approach, 
see also Bendsere (1989) or Mlejnek (1992), leads to a nonlinear programming 
problem of the form 
where x denotes the relative densities, u the displacement vector computed from 
the linear system of equations K(x)u = f with positive definite stiffness matrix 
K(x) and external load vector f. The relative densities and the elementary 
stiffness matrices Kf define K(x) by 
V(x) is the volume of the structure, usually a linear function of the design 
variables. xl is a vector of small positive numbers to avoid singularities. The 
power 3 in the state equation is found heuristically and usually applied in 
practice. Its role is to penalize intermediate values between the lower bound 
and 1. Topology optimization problems lead easily to very large scale, highly 
nonlinear optimization problems. The probably most simple example is a half 
beam, for our test discretized by 390 x 260 linear four-nodes square elements 
leading to 101,400 optimization variables. SCPIP computes the solution shown 
in Figure 7.1 after 30 iterations. 
7 CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we try to describe SQP and SCP methods in a uniform way. In 
both cases, convex subproblems are formulated from which a suitable search 
direction with respect to the design variables and the multipliers are computed. 
A subsequent line search based on the augmented Lagrangian merit function 
stabilizes the optimization algorithm and allows to prove global convergence.

Starting from an arbitrary initial design, a stationary point satisfying the nec- 
essary Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions is approximated. 
However, both methods differ significantly in their underlying motivation. 
SQP algorithms proceed from a local quadratic model with the goal to achieve a 
fast local convergence speed, superlinearly in case of quasi-Newton updates for 
the Hessian of the Lagrangian. On the other hand, SCP methods apply a global 
convex and nonlinear approximation of objective function and constraints based 
on linearized inverse variables, by using first order information only. 
Numerical results based on standard, small scale benchmark problems and 
on structural design optimization problems are included, also a brief summary 
of some industrial applications the authors are involved in.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present some results, of a study of 
linear programming in measure spaces (LPM). We prove that under certain con- 
ditions, there exists a solution for LPM. We develop an approximation scheme to 
solve LPM and prove the convergence properties of the approximation scheme. 
Key words: Linear programming in measure spaces, optimal solution, approx- 
imation scheme, linear semi-infinite programming problems.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Let (E, F) and (2, W) be two dual pairs of ordered vector spaces. Let E+ and 
Z+ be the positive cones for E and Z respectively, and E; 
and ZT be the 
polar cones of E+ and Z+ respectively. The general linear programming and 
its dual problem may be stated as follows: Given b* E F, c E Z, and a linear 
map A : E -t 2, then linear programming problem and its dual problem can 
be formulated as: 
(LP) 
minimize (x, b*) 
subject to Ax - c E Z+ and x E E+; 
(DLP) maximize (c, y*) 
subject to b* - A*y* E ET 
and y* E 2:. 
We now discuss this kind of linear programming in measure spaces. Glashoff 
and Gustafson (1982) discuss linear semi-infinite programming (LSIP) in which 
the constraint inequalities are subject to the relationships of finite linear com- 
binations of functions to functions. The theory and algorithms for linear semi- 
infinite programming are discussed in Glashoff and Gustafson (1982); Hettich 
and Kortanek (1993); Lai and Wu (1992a); Reemtsen and Gorner (1998); Wu 
et a1 (1998). The generalized capacity problem is an infinite dimensional linear 
programming problem. The generalized capacity problem extends the linear 
semi-infinite programming from the variable space Rn to variable space of the 
regular Borel measure space. Lai and Wu (1992) investigate the generalized 
capacity problem (GCAP) in which the constraint inequalities are subject to 
the relationships of measures to a function. Kellerer (1988) explores linear 
programming in measure spaces using a theoretical model. He consideres the 
linear programming problems for measure spaces of the forms: 
(PI) minimize J, h d p  
subject to pp, 2 v in M(Y), 
where p, maps p E M+(X) to M(Y), and 
(Dl) maximize Jy gdv 
subject to all measurable functions g 2 0 on Y, and pg 5 h, 
where p maps the set of nonnegative measurable functions 
on Y to measurable functions on X. 
Here X and Y are topological spaces endowed with their Borel algebras, 
and M+(X) denotes the set of nonnegative measures in M(X). Lai and Wu 

APPROXIMATION APPROACH FOR LP IN MEASURE SPACE 
333 
(1994) discuss LPM and DLPM (defined in this section) with constraint in- 
equalities on the relationships of measures to measures. They prove that under 
certain conditions the LPM problem can be reformulated as a general capac- 
ity problem as well as a linear semi-infinite programming problem. Therefore 
LPM is a generalization of the general capacity problem and linear semi-infinite 
programming problem. Lai and Wu (1994); Wen and Wu (2001) develope algo- 
rithms for solving LPM when certain conditions are added to an LPM. In the 
present paper, we develop an approximation scheme to solve LPM in section 
3. This scheme is a discritization method. Bascially, this approach finds a se- 
quence of optimal solutions of corresponding linear semi-infinite programs and 
shows that the sequence of optimal solutions converges to an optimal solution 
of LPM. In section 4, we give an algorithm to find the optimal solution of linear 
semi-infinite programming problem. 
We now formulate a linear program for measure spaces (LPM). As in Lai 
and Wu (1994), X and Y are compact Hausdorff spaces, C(X) and M(X) are, 
respectively, spaces of continuous real valued function and spaces of regular 
Borel measures on X .  We denote the totality of non-negative Borel mersures 
on X as M+(X) and the subset of C(X) consisting of non-negative functions 
as C+ (X). Given v, v* E M(Y), cp E C(X x Y) and h E C(X), we know from 
Lai and Wu (1994) that LPM can be formulated as follows: 
LPM : minimize Sx h dp(x) 
subject to p E M+(X), 
and 
SB SX ' P ( X > Y ) ~ P ( X ) ~ ~ * ( Y )  
2 v(B) 
for 
B(Y)' 
Here B(Y) stands for the Borel field of Y. We define the bilinear functionals 
( a ,  
a )  
and ( a ,  
as follows: 
For any cp E C(X x Y), we define a linear operator A : M(X) + M(Y) by 
Ap(B) = 
+(p, y)dv* (y) for any B E B(Y) and p E M(X), 
IB 

334 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
is a continuous function on Y, and v* E M(Y). 
Applying Fubini theorem, we have 
where A*g(.) = Jy g(y)cp(x, y)dv*(y) is the adjoint operator of A. It is clear 
that M+(X) is a a(M(X), C(Y))-closed convex cone, and M+(Y) is a 
a(M(Y), C(X))-closed convex cone. From Kretschmer (1961), we know that 
LPM has an associated dual problem: 
where v, v* E M(Y), cp E C(X x Y) and h E C(X) are given. 
A feasible solution of an optimization problem (P) is a point satisfying the 
constraints of problem (P). The set of all feasible solutions for problem (P) is 
called the feasible set of problem (P), which we denote by F(P). If F ( P )  is 
not empty, then we say the problem (P) is consistent. We denote by V(P) the 
optimal values for problem (P). 
Wen and Wu (2001) proved that under some conditions there is no duality 
gap for LPM. Now we state the result as follows. 
Theorem 1.1 Suppose DLPM is consistent and -oo < V(DLPM) < m. If 
there exists a g* E C+(Y) such that 
1' g*(y)cp(x, y)dv*(y) < h(x) for allx E X. 
Then LPM has no duality gap. 
Corollary 1.1 . Suppose DLPM (or LPM) is consistent with finite value. If 
h(x) > 0 or h(x) < 0 for all x E X, then LPM has no duality gap.

SOLVABILITY OF LPM 
In this section, we shall prove that under some simple conditions, there exists 
a solution for LPM. 
Theorem 2.1 . Suppose LPM is consistent with finite value. If h(x) > 0, 
V x  E X ,  then LPM is solvable. 
Proof: It is obvious that /, h(x)dp(x) 2 0, V p  E F(LPM), since h(x) > 0, 
V x  E X. If Sx h(x)dp(x) = 0, V p  E F(LPM), then LPM is solvable. Hence 
we may assume that, without loss of generality, there exists a po E F(LPM) 
such that 
h(x)dpo(x) > 0 and V ( L P M )  < 
Let {pn : n E IN) G F(LPM) be such that Sx h(x)dp,(x) J. V ( L P M ) .  Since 
there exists n* E IN such that 
This implies that 
By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, there exists p* E M+(X) and a subsequence 
{pnj : j E IN) of {p, : n E IN) such that 

336

Hence, for every g E C+ (Y), 
since pnj E F(LPM), V j  E IN. This implies that Ap* - v E M+(Y). Hence 
p* E F(LPM). 
we obtain 
V(LPM) = 
h(x)dp*(x). 
Therefore LPM is solvable. 
3 AN APPROXIMATION SCHEME FOR LPM 
In this section, let X and Y be compact sets on R. We shall develop an scheme 
for solving LPM. This scheme is a discritization method. To derive the scheme, 
we now reformulate LPM in equality form as follows. 
For the given cp E C(X x Y), v* E M(Y), we define a linear operator 
We also define the bilinear function (., 
as follows: 
for all (p, P) E M(X) x M(Y) and (f, g) E C(X) x C(Y). Then ELPM can be 
rewritten as follows: 
Minimize ((p, p), (h, 0))3 
s.t. &,p) 
= v, 
and p E M+(X), P E M+(Y). 

APPROXIMATION APPROACH FOR LP IN MEASURE SPACE 
337 
Applying Fubini theorem, we have 
where 2, 
defined by 
is the adjoint of 2 .  Since 2 maps C(Y) into C(X) x C(Y), 2 is weakly 
continuous by Proposition 4 in Anderson and Nash (1987). 
For every k E IN, we let 
be a subset of polynomials. Instead of the original program ELPM, we consider 
the linear program 
( ~ ~ ~ ~ ) b i n i m i z e  
((p, p), (h, 0))3 
subject to (X(p,p) - u,g)2 = 0, 
V g  E P k ,  
and, 
p E M+(x), 
E M+(Y). 
The (ELPM)"rogram 
is a discritized version of LPM. As there will be no 
danger of confusion, from now on, the bilinear functionals 
( a ,  
(., .)2, and 
( a ,  
are a11 represented by ( a ,  .). Then we have the following result: 
Theorem 3.1 Suppose LPM is consistent with finite value. If the subprograms 
( E L P M ) ~  satisfy the following conditions: 
(1) For every k E IN, (ELPM)"~ 
solvable with an optimal solution (p;,p;), 
and 
(2) there exists a positive number M such that Ilp;ll + IIpiII 5 M .  
Then 
(a) ELPM is solvable. 

338 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Proof: It is obvious that F(ELPM) C F((ELPM)"') 
C F((ELPM)~), 
V k  E IN. Hence V(ELPM) > V((ELPM)"l) > ~((ELPM)", V k  E IN. 
That is, 
and so the sequence  pi pi,^;), (h, 0)) : k  E IN) is increasing and has an upper 
bound. Hence 
P 
lim ((pi, pi), (h, 0)) = lim 1 h(x)dp;(x) 5 V(ELPM). 
(3.1) 
k+m 
k+m x 
By condition (2) and the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, there exist (p*, P*) E M+(X) x 
M+(Y) and a subsequence {(p& ,P;E3) : j E IN) G {(p;,pi) : k E IN) such that 
We claim that 
(p*,p*) E F(ELPM). 
To show this claim, it suffices to prove that 
00 
because, according to the fact that U span(Pk) is dense in C(Y), 
(3.4) implies 
k=l 
that (p*, F*) E F(ELPM). 
00 
Now to prove (3.4), let g E U span(Pk), and write 
k=l 
since the weak convergence (pij, pi.) t (p*, F*) and the weak continuity of 
00 
x. On the other hand, as g is in U span(Pk), there is a x such that g is in 
k=l 
span(PF). Since g E span(Pz), there exists m 5 x + 1 such that 
m 
g = C Xigi with gi E % and 
Xi E R (i = 1,2,3,. . . , m). 
i=l

339 
Moreover, as F((ELPM)W1) c F ( ( E L P M ) ~ )  for every k E IN, 
Hence, 
Let j -+ KI in (3.5), and from (3.6) and (3.6), we obtain (3.4). Thus we have 
(3.3). 
Therefore, combining (3.1), (3.2) and, (3.3), we have 
and complete the proof. 
Corollary 3.1 Suppose LPM is consistent with finite value. If the given data 
h and v* satisfy the following conditions: 
(1) h(z) > 0, Vx E X, and 
then 
(a) (ELPM)k is solvable for every k E IN. 
(b) For every k E IN, let   pi,^:) be an optimal solution for (ELPM)" 
Then 
Proof: (a) Given k E IN. As in the proof of Theorem 2.1, we may assume that 
there exists ( p r ) , ~ ? ) )  E F((ELPM)" such that 
h(x)dpr)(x)>O and v((ELPM)")<

Let {(pk,,pk,) : n E IN) C F((ELPM)~) be such that 
By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.1, there exist p; E M+(X), 
n* E IN, and a subsequence {pknj : j E IN) C {pk, : n E IN) such that

(3.10) 
since (kj,Pk,,) E F((ELPWk), (X(~k,~,iikJ - 4 9 )  = 0, V9 E Pk. In

particular, (A(pknj, Pk ) - V, 1) = 0. That is,

pkrj + pi weakly as j + CQ. 
(3.11) 
Combining (3.10) and (3.11), we obtain 
This implies that (p;,p;) E F((ELPM)~), since, for every g E P k ,

341 
Now (3.12) combining with (3.8) also yields that (pi, Pi) is an optimal solution 
for (ELPM)" as 
(b) As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, the sequence {((p;,pi), (h,O)))r=l is 
increasing and convergent. As in part (a), we may assume that there exists 
(pO,&,) E F(ELPM) such that 
h(x)dpo(x)>O and V(ELPM)< 
Also by the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.1, there exists a 
subsequence {pij : j E IN) 5 {pi : k E IN) such that 
Since ( p & , q )  E F((ELPM)~~) for every j E IN, (x(pij,pij) - v, 1) = 0. By 
the same argument as in part (a), we have 
Hence by Theorem 3.1, we obtain 
and this implies 
Although the programs (ELPM~) are solvable, it is not always easy to 
solve them. To overcome the difficulty, we shall consider the dual problem of 
(ELPM)" For k E IN, we define a linear operator 

342 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Applying Fubini theorem, we have 
where & : Rwl -+ C(X) x C(Y), defined by 

APPROXIMATION APPROACH FOR LP IN MEASURE SPACE 
343 
is the adjoint operator of &. Hence the dual problem for (ELPM)k is defined 
as follows: 
(DELPM)~ : maximize c ~ = ~ ( J ~

'd y E Y. 
(DELPM)~ : maximize c:=~

Note that (DELPM)k is basically the same as CSIP, the continuous semi- 
infinite program, except that the "minimization" in CSIP is replaced by "max- 
imization" in (DELPM)~. Moreover, for every k E IN, there is no duality gap 
for (ELPM)~ and (DELPM)k under the condition that h(x) > 0, 'dx E X.

Theorem 3.2 If h(x) > 0, Vx E X, then for every k E W, there is no duality

Since h(x) > 0, V x  E X and owing to (3.14), PO is the zero measure on X .  
Thus, from (3.13), we have 
and this implies that Po is the zero measure on Y .  Therefore, there is no 
(p,p) E M + ( X )  x M+(Y) other than zero measure with &(P, p) = 0 and 
( ( p , ~ ) ,  
(h, 0)) = 0. As the positive cone M+(X) x M+(Y) is weakly closed and 
the associated dual cone C + ( X )  x C+(Y) has a non-empty interior 
in the Mackey topology T ( C ( X )  x C ( Y ) ,  M ( X )  x M ( Y ) ) ,  by Corollary 3.18 
in Anderson and Nash (1987), there is no duality gap for (ELPM)%nd

where M+(T) is the space of all nonnegative bounded regular Bore1 measures 
on T. Note that (ELPM)~ and S I P k  have the same optimal solution as well 
as 
~((DELPM)" = -v(sIP~). 
Many algorithms in Glashoff and Gustafson (1982); Hettich and Kortanek 
(1993); Lai and Wu (1992a); Reemtsen and Gorner (1998); Wu et a1 (1998) 
can be applied to solve S I P k .  Based on Wu et a1 (1998), we develop an explicit 
algorithm for sloving SIPk. 
To introduce the algorithm, let us start with some notations. Let T = 
{tl, tz, . . . , t,) 
be a subset with m elements in T. We denote by (LPk(T1)) the 
following linear program with m constraints induced by TI: 
The dual problem of (LPk(T1)) can be formulated as the following problem: 
(DLPk(T1)) :maximize CGl g(tj) yj 
such that CF1 fi(tj)yj = ci, i = 0,1,2,. . . , k. 
y j > O , V j = 1 , 2  ,..., m. 
Given that b > 0 is a prescribed small number, we state our algorithm in the 
following steps: 
Step 0 Let n + 1, choose any ty E T, set TI = {ty), and set mo = 0. 
Step 1 Solve LPk(Tn). Let X n  = (x;, x?, x?, . . . , x:) 
be an optimal solution 
of LPk(Tn). Define 
Step 2 Solve DLPk(Tn). Let Yn = (yy, yz, . . . , ykn_,+,) be an optimal 
solution DLPk(Tn). Define a discrete measure pn on T by letting

Step 3 Find any tkn+, E T such that +,(tk,+,) 
< -6. 
If such t",+l 
does not exist, stop and output X n  as a solution. Otherwise, set 
Tn+l= E n U  {tkn+l). 
Step 4 Update n t n + 1, and go to step 1. 
In the above algorithm, we make the following assumptions: 
(Al) LPk(Tn) and DLPk(Tn) are both solvable for every n E IN, 
(A2) LPk(En) has the unique solution for every n E IN. 
Note that tkn+l E En+1, that is, pn+l(tkn+l) > 0. Otherwise, we have 
~ n + l ( t k ~ + ~ )  
= 0, which implies that V(LPk(Tn+1)) = V(DLPk(Tn+l)) = 
V(DLPk(En)). Since V(DLPk(En)) = V(DLPk(Tn)), we have V(LPk(Tn+l)) = 
V(DLPk(Tn)) = V(LPk(Tn)). Since X n  and x"+' are feasible for LPk(En), 
they are both optimal solutions for LPk(En). Hence, by the assumption (A2), 
we have Xn = Xn+l, and this implies that +,(t",+,) 
> 0, which is a contra- 
diction. 
Proof: Since En+i - {tkn+l) c En, we have, by the definition (4.2) of an, 
an(t) > 0, Vt E En+l - {t~m+l). Hence, from the complementary slackness 
theorem of linear programming, we get 
which implies

k 
and we complete the proof. 
If, in each iteration, there exists a 6 > 0 such that pn(t) > 6, V t  E En, then 
by Theorem 4.1, we obtain 
Hence we have the following corollary. 
Corollary 4.1 Given any 6 > 0, in each iteration, if there exists a 6 > 0 such 
that pn(t) > 6, V t E En, then V(LPk(Tn+l)) > V(LPk(Tn)). 
Theorem 4.1 as well as Corollary 4.1 are fundamental results for the algo- 
rithm; with them, we show that, under proper conditions, for any given 6 > 0, 
the proposed algorithm actually terminates in a finite number iterations. 
Theorem 4.2 Given any 6 > 0, in each iteration, assume that: 
(A3) There exzsts a M > 0 such that llXnll 5 M; 
(A4) There exists a 6 > 0 such that pn(t) 2 6, Vt E En. 
Then, the algorithm terminates in a finite number of iterations. 
Proof: Suppose the scheme does not stop in a finite number of iterations. By 
Corollary 4.1, we have 
We claim that this is impossible. By (A3), the infinite sequence { X n )  is con- 
fined in a compact set C in Rn. There exists a subsequence {Xnr) of { X n )  

348

such that Xnr converges to X*, and the subsequence {t$nT+l) converges to 
some point t, as r + oo. Now we let 
Then, by (4.1), 4nT(t$n,+l) converges to &(t,). Since &. (tZT+,) < -6, for 
each r, we have 
Now, let E be an arbitrary number, and we can find a large integer nN E {nr}zl 
such that 
By Theorem 4.1, we have 
Hence, (4.4) cannot be true, and we have a contradiction. Therefore our claim 
is valid and the proof is complete. 
Under conditions (A3) and (A4), Theorem 4.2 assures that the proposed 
scheme terminates in finitely many iterations, say n* iterations, with an optimal 
solution 
n* 
X 
= (x;',xn* 1 , x; * , . . . , $*). 
In this case, xn* 
can be viewed as an approximate solution of (SIPk). The 
next theorem tells us how good such an approximate solution can be.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent papers Banks (2001), Banks and Dinesh (2000) have applied a se- 
quence of linear time-varying approximations to find feedback controllers for 
nonlinear systems. Thus, for the optimal control problem

subject to the dynamics 
X (t) = A ( x  (t)) 
x (t) + B ( x  (t)) u (t) , 
x (0) = xo 
(1.2) 
they have introduced the sequence of approximations

and

The approximations have been shown to converge under very mild conditions 
(that each operator is locally Lipschitz) and to provide very effective control 
in many examples. However, optimality has not been proved and, in fact, the 
limit control is unlikely to be optimal in general (and indeed, there may be no 
optimal control since the nonlinear systems considered are very general). Hence, 
in this paper, we consider the full necessary equations derived from Pontryagin's 
maximum principle and compare them with the original "approximate optimal 
control" method proposed in Banks and Dinesh (2000).

THE APPROXIMATING SYSTEMS 
2.1 Classical Optimal Control Theory 
Let us first look at classical optimal control theory where we consider the linear 
system 
x (t) = A (t) x (t) + B (t) u (t) , 
x (0) = xo 
(2.1) 
with the finite-time cost functional

(2.2) 
It is well known (see, for example, Banks (1986)) that from the maximum 
principle, the solution to the linear-quadratic regulator problem is given by the 
coupled two-point boundary value problem 
A(t) -B(t)R-l(t)BT(t)

with 
Assuming that X (t) = P (t) x (t) for some positive-definite symmetric matrix 
P (t), the necessary conditions are then satisfied by the Riccati equation 
P (t) = -Q (t) - P (t) A (t) - AT (t) P (t) + P (t) B (t) R-l (t) B~ (t) P (t) , 
P ( t f )  = F 
(2.5) 
yielding the linear optimal control law given by 
u (t) = - R - ~  
(t) B~ (t) P (t) x (t) . 
(2.6) 
2.2 Global Optimal Control 
Now consider applying the maximum principle to the nonlinear-quadratic regu- 
lator problem (1.1), (1.2) as in classical linear optimal control theory. We thus 
have the Hamiltonian

We know that the two-point boundary value problem (2.3) with conditions 
(2.4) represents the classical optimal control of a linear system with quadratic 
cost (2.2) subject to the dynamics (2.1), the solution of which is given by the 
Riccati equation (2.5) together with the optimal control law (2.6). Therefore, 
since each approximating problem in (2.8) is linear-quadratic, the system (2.8) 
with conditions (2.9), (2.10) and (2.11) is equivalent to the classical optimal 
control of a linear system with quadratic cost 
subject to the dynamics 
and so the solution is given by the Riccati equation 
P (t) = -6 (t) - P (t) A" (t) - A"T (t) P (t) + P (t) Zj (t) 2-l (t) BT (t) P (t) , 
P ( t f )  = F 
together with the optimal control law 
u (t) = - E - I  ( t )  BT ( t )  P (t) x ( t )  
where we have made the assumption that X ( t )  = P (t) x (t) as in classical 
optimal control theory. Hence the solution to the nonlinear optimal control

problem (2.7) for these necessary conditions with quadratic cost (1.1) subject

2.3 Solving the Approximating Sequence 
Similar to the "approximate optimal control" technique (see Banks and Dinesh 
(2000)), optimization is carried out for each sequence on the system trajectory 
for the "global optimal control" approach. In order to calculate the optimal 
solution, it is necessary to solve the approximate matrix Riccati equation se- 
quence (2.12) storing the values of P (t) from each sequence at every discrete 
time-step. In practice this will be done in a computer and it will be necessary 
to solve the Riccati equation using standard numerical integration procedures, 

360 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
starting at the final time t = t f  and integrating backwards in time by taking 
negative time-steps. It should be noted that, even though the problem is to 
be solved in discrete-time, we do not solve the discrete-time Riccati equation 
as the dynamics are essentially continuous-time. The control that minimizes 
the finite-time quadratic cost functional at every time-step for each sequence 
is then given by (2.13). The approximating sequence for the states is obtained 
by solving (2.14), again storing the values x (t) from each sequence at every 
time-step. 
Let us consider solving the sequence of approximations. F'rom (2.14) the 
first approximation is given by 
do' (t) = ( A  (xo) - B ( X O )  R-' (xo) B~ (xo) P[O] (t)) x[O1 (t) , 
xlOl (0) = xo 
where P[O] (t) is the solution of equation (2.12) for i = 0 where we assume 
x[~-'] (t) = x0 and P[~-'] 
(t) = F (so). 
The second approximation is then given 
by 
$1 
(t) = z 
(t) x[l] (t) , 
x['] (0) = x0 
where 
- 
A (t) = A (xio] (t)) - B (xlO] (t)) R-' (xlol (t)) B~ ( X [ O ]  (t)) P['l (t) 
such that 2 : IR, + IR"' and z(t) now represents a time-varying linear ma- 
trix. Here p['] (t) is obtained by again solving (2.12) for i = 1, this time 
replacing x[~-'] (t) and P[~-'] 
(t) with the previous approximations x[O] (t) and 
P[O] (t) respectively. The subsequent approximations are obtained in a similar 
way. Thus, in solving (2.12)-(2.14), we obtain a sequence of time-varying linear 
equations where each sequence is solved as a standard numerical problem. For 
each sequence, optimization has to be carried out at every numerical integra- 
tion time-step resulting in dynamic feedback control values. When both xli] 
and di] have converged on the kth sequence, on applying the control uI" of the 
converged sequence to the true nonlinear system (1.2), the solution obtained 
should be the same as that of the converged approximation. This is expected 
since x [ ~ ]  
(t) = x (t) when xii] (t) has converged.

EXAMPLE 
Balancing an inverted pendulum on a motor-driven cart, as shown in Figure 3.1, 
has become a popular controller design problem. The objective in the control

of this model is to move the cart to a specified position while maintaining the 
pendulum vertical. The inverted pendulum is unstable in that it may fall over 
any time in any direction unless a suitable control force u is applied and is 
often used to test new controller designs. Here only a two-dimensional problem 
is considered, that the pendulum moves only in the plane of the page. 
Let us now apply the theories of "approximate optimal control" and "global 
optimal control" to the inverted pendulum system where the mathematical 
model is given by the equations (see Ogata (1997)) 
Defining the four state-variables XI, x2, x3, x4 as x, 0, x, e respectively, we 
can represent the system (3.1) in state-space in the form (1.2) as

r = 0.5 m, and the acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.81 m/sec2, the state- 
space model (3.2) representing the inverted pendulum system was simulated 
using Euler's numerical integration technique with time-step 0.02 sec. The 
performance matrices have been chosen independent of the system states such 
that Q = F = diag (1, 1, 1, 1) and R = [I], so that the Jacobians of these 
become zero. In simulating the inverted pendulum system (using a simulation 
package such as MATLAB@) we only consider the regulator problem where 
our objective is to drive all the system states to zero. We also assume that the 
system starts from rest and simulate it for a given initial angle.

RESULTS 
The "approximate optimal control" technique has been shown to provide very 
effective control in that the pendulum is stabilizable from any given initial an- 
gle. In fact taking the initial horizon time tf < 1.9 sec and proceeding with 
the control of the approximating sequence from where left-off, by taking the 
final state values as initial conditions and defining a new horizon time, the 
pendulum can even be stabilized for its uncontrollable states (6 = f 
n/2 rad). 
This is because the "approximate optimal control" technique does not require 
a stabilizability condition to be satisfied - it only requires Lipschitz continuity. 
Although stability is not guaranteed in general, on a finite-time interval, it 
has been achieved for the uncontrollable states of the inverted pendulum sys- 
tem. A related "local freezing control" technique given in Banks and Mhana 
(1992) (where optimization is carried out point-wise on the system trajectory 
for the nonlinear system (1.2) has been shown to stabilize the inverted pendu- 
lum from any given initial angle except its uncontrollable states. The "global 
optimal control" strategy, however, provides control that stabilizes the inverted 
pendulum system for initial angles within the interval f 
1.1 rad beyond which 
problems arise related to the convergence of the approximations for the nec- 
essary conditions. This may be related to the solution being a discontinuous 
feedback and a viscosity solution, causing the algorithm to eventually blow up. 
Note also that the "global optimal control" strategy is harder to implement, 
which requires the Jacobians of A (x), B (x), F (x), Q (x), and R (x), hence 
taking a longer time to converge to the optimal solution. 
Figures 4.1 and 4.2 illustrate and compare the converged solutions using 
both techniques when the initial angle is set to 6 = 0.75 rad and 6 = 1.0 rad

From the plots it is obvious that the solutions obtained using these tech- 
niques are indeed very close. From Table 4.1, a similar statement can be made 
about the costs associated with each approximating strategy. However, note 
that there are problems in obtaining slightly larger costs using the "global op- 
timal control" approach. This may be due to numerical problems since the 
costs obtained are only approximations. It may also be due to nonexistence 
of a global optimum since we have only considered the necessary (and not 
sufficient) conditions for an optimum, which may result in the approximating

systems converging to any of the local optima. Thus the proposed technique 
still remains "approximate optimal control", which provides solutions close to 
the optimal one, without having the need to compute any Jacobians of the

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we have considered the full necessary conditions of a system with 
nonlinear dynamics, derived from Pontryagin's maximum principle, and com- 
pared them with the original "approximate optimal control" method. We have 
thus considered a nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear dynamics and 
replaced it with a sequence of time-varying linear-quadratic regulator problem, 
where we have made the argument that the set of approximating systems are 
equivalent to the classical optimal control of a linear-quadratic regulator system 
and hence can be solved classically giving the solution to the "global optimal 
control", in the case where such a control exists. Even though the approx- 
imating systems using the "approximate optimal control" strategy may not 
converge to a global optimum of the nonlinear system, by considering a similar 
approximation sequence (given by the necessary conditions of the maximum

principle), we have seen that the proposed method gives solutions very close to 
the optimal one in many cases for the inverted pendulum system. The meth- 
ods used here are very general and apply to a very wide range of nonlinear 
systems. Future work will examine issues on discontinuity of the solution of 
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and viscosity solutions.

ments in this area. Some numerical results for optimal control problems are also 
included in order to illustrate the numerical behaviour of these proximal-like 
methods.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
This paper gives a brief survey of some proximal-like methods for the solution 
of convex minimization problems. To this end, let f : IRn -+ IR U {+co) be 
a closed, proper, convex function, and consider the associated optimization 
problem 
min f(x), x€IRn. 
(1.1) 
Formally, this is an unconstrained problem. However, since f is allowed to be 
extended-valued, any constrained problem of the form 
min j(x) subject to x E X 
for some convex function 1 : IRn -+ IR and a closed, nonempty and convex set 
X E IRn can easily be transformed into a minimization problem of the form 
(1.1) by defining 
f(x), if x E X, 
f (x) := 
+co, 
if x # X .  
Hence, theoretically, there is no loss of generality by considering the uncon- 
strained problem (1.1). In fact, many theoretical results can be obtained in 
this (unifying) way for both unconstrained and constrained optimization prob- 
lems. The interested reader is referred to the classical book by Rockafellar 
(1970) for further details. 
Despite the fact that extended-valued functions allow such a unified treat- 
ment of both unconstrained and constrained problems, they are typically not 
tractable from a numerical point of view. Therefore, numerical algorithms for 
the solution of a problem like (1.1) have to take into account the constraints 
explicitly or, at least, some of these constraints. This can be done quite ele- 
gantly by so-called proximal-like methods. Similar to interior-point algorithms, 
these methods generate strictly feasible iterates and are usually applied to the 
problem with nonnegativity constraints 
min f(x) s.t. x 2 0  
(1.2) 
or to the linearly constrained problem 
min f (x) s.t.

where, in the latter case, A E IRnXm and b E IRm are the given data. 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
371 
While we concentrate on the application of proximal-like methods to op- 
timization problems, we should at least mention that proximal-like methods 
may also be applied to several other problem classes like nonlinear systems 
of equations, complementarity problems, variational inequalities and general- 
ized equations. The interested reader is referred to Lemaire (1989); Lemaire 
(1992); Eckstein (1998); Censor et al. (1998); Auslender et al. (199913); Solodov 
and Svaiter (2000b) and the corresponding references in these papers for more 
details. 
This paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 first reviews the 
classical proximal-point method and then describes several proximal-like meth- 
ods for the solution of the constrained optimization problems (1.2) and (1.3). 
In Section 3, we then present some numerical results obtained with some of 
these proximal-like methods when applied to some classes of optimal control 
problems. We then conclude with some final remarks in Section 4. 
The notation used in this paper is quite standard: Rn denotes the n-dimensi- 
onal Euclidean space, inequalities like x 2 0 or x > 0 for a vector x E Rn are 
defined componentwise, R:+ 
:= {x E Cn I x > 0) denotes the strictly positive 
orthant, and 3 is the closure of a subset S C Rn.

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
Throughout this section, we make the blanket assumption that f : IRn + 
IR U {+oo) is a closed, proper and convex function. 
2.1 Classical Proximal-Point Method 
The classical proximal-point method was introduced by Martinet (1970) and 
further developped by Rockafellar (1976) and others, see, e.g., the survey by 
Lemaire (1989). Being applied to the minimization problem (1.1), it generates 
a sequence {x" C Cn such that x"' 
is a solution of the subproblem 
1 
min f (x) + -llx - x?I2 
2x1, 
for k = 0,1,. . .; here, XI, denotes a positive number. The objective function of 
this subproblem is strictly convex since it is the sum of the original (convex) 
objective function f and a strictly convex quadratic term. This term is usually 
called the regularization term. 

372 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
This strictly convex regularization term guarantees that the subproblem 
(2.1) has a unique minimizer for each k E IN. Hence the classical proximal-point 
method is well-defined. Furthermore, it has the following global convergence 
properties, see, e.g., Giiler (1991) for a proof of this result. 
Theorem 2.1 Let {xk} and {Xk) be two sequences generated by the classical 
proximal-point method (2.1), define a k  := zk 
3=o A. 
3, let f ,  := inf{f (x) 1 x E 
IW) be the optimal value and S := {x* E IRn I f (x*) = f*) be the solution set 
of (1.1). Assume that a k  + 00. Then the following statements hold: 
(a) The sequence of function values { f  (xk)} converges to the optimal value 
f*. 
(b) If S # 0, then the entire sequence {x" 
converges to an element of S. 
Theorem 2.1 states some very strong convergence properties under rather 
weak conditions. In particular, it guarantees the convergence of the entire 
sequence {xk) even if the solution set S contains more than one element; in 
fact, this statement also holds for an unbounded solution set S. Note that the 
assumption ak + 00 holds, for example, if the sequence {Xk) is constant, i.e., 
if X k  = X for all k E N and some positive number A. 
We note that many variations of Theorem 2.1 are available in the litera- 
ture. For example, it is not necessary to compute the exact minimizer of the 
subproblems (2.1) at each step, see Rockafellar (1976) for some criteria under 
which inexact solutions still provide similar global convergence properties. It 
should be noted, however, that the criteria of inexactness in Rockafellar (1976) 
are not implementable in general since they assume some knowledge regarding 
the exact solution of (2.1). On the other hand, Solodov and Svaiter (1999) 
recently gave a more constructive criterion in a slightly different framework. 
F'urthermore, some rate of convergence results can be shown for the classical 
proximal-point method under a certain error bound condition, cf. Luque (1984). 
This error bound condition holds, for example, for linearly constrained problems 
due to Hoffman's error bound Hoffman (1952). Moreover, being applied to 
linear programs, it is known that the classical proximal-point method has a 
finite termination property, see Ferris (1991) for details. 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
373 
We also note that the classical proximal-point method can be extended 
to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for which weak convergence of the it- 
erates {xk) can be shown, see Rockafellar (1976); Giiler (1991) once again. 
Strong convergence does not hold without any further modifications as noted 
by Giiler (1991) who provides a counterexample. On the other hand, using 
a rather simple modification of the classical proximal-point method, Solodov 
and Svaiter (2000a) were able to present a strongly convergent version of the 
classical proximal-point method in Hilbert spaces. 
In contrast to the classical proximal-point method, the proximal-like meth- 
ods to be presented in our subsequent discussion have only been presented in 
the finite dimensional setting; this is mainly due to the fact that they typically 
involve some logarithmic functions. 
2.2 Proximal-like Methods Using Bregman Functions 
The simple idea which is behind each proximal-like method for the solution of 
convex minimization problems is, more or less, to replace the strictly quadratic 
term in the regularized subproblem (2.1) by a more general strictly convex 
function. Later on, we will see that this might be a very useful idea when 
solving constrained problems. 
There are quite a few different possibilities to replace the term 411x - xkl12 
by another strictly convex distance-like function. The one we discuss in this 
subsection is defined by 
where $ is a so-called Bregman function. According to Solodov and Svaiter 
(2000a), a Bregman function may be defined in the following way. 
Definition 2.1 Let S C IRn be an open and convex set. A mapping $ : 3 + IR 
is called a Bregman function with zone S i f  it has the following properties: 
(i) $ is strictly convex and continuous on 3; 
(ii) $ is continuously differentiable in S; 
(iii) The partial level set 

374 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
is bounded for every x E 3; 
(iv) If {yk} C S converges to x, then limk,, 
D$(x, yk) = 0. 
Earlier papers on Bregman functions require some additional properties, see 
De Pierro and Iusem (1986); Censor and Zenios (1992); Eckstein (1993); Guler 
(1994); Censor et al. (1998). However, as noted in Solodov and Svaiter (2000a), 
all these additional properties follow from those mentioned in Definition 2.1. 
Two simple

$2(x)

Using + = 
examples of Bregman functions are: 
2 xi log xi - xi on S = lR:+ 
(convention: O logo = 0). 
i= 1 
in the definition of D$, we reobtain the subproblem (2.1) of 
the classical proximal-point method. On the other hand, using $ = $2 in the 
definition of Dq gives the so-called Kullback-Leibler relative entropy function 
This function may be used in order to solve the constrained optimization prob- 
lem (1.2) by generating a sequence {xk} in such a way that xk+l is a solution 
of the subproblem 
1 
min f(x)+-D+(x,x~), 
x > O  
x k  
for k = 0,1,2,. . ., where so > 0 is a strictly feasible starting point. Then 
a convergence result completely identical to Theorem 2.1 can be shown for 
this method, see Chen and Teboulle (1993) for details. Some related papers 
dealing with Bregman functions in the context of proximal-like methods are 
Eckstein (1993); Guler (1994); Eckstein (1998); Censor et al. (1998), where the 
interested reader will find rules which allow inexact solutions of the subproblems 
(2.3) and where he will also find some rate of convergence results. In contrast 
to the classical proximal-point method, however, the proximal-like methods do 
not possess any finite termination properties for linear programs. 
On the other hand, a major advantage of the proximal-like methods is that 
a subproblem like (2.3) is essentially unconstrained and can therefore be solved 
by unconstrained minimization techniques. 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
375 
2.3 Proximal-like Methods Using 9-Divergences 
Another variant of the classical proximal-point method is a proximal-like method 
based on so-called cp-divergences. These cp-divergences will be used in order to 
replace the strictly convex quadratic term in the subproblem (2.1) of the clas- 
sical proximal-point method. 
Definition 2.2 Let @ denote the class of closed, proper and convex functions 
cp : R + (-oo, +oo] with dom(cp) 5 [0, +oo) having the following properties: 
(2) 
cp is twice wntinuously diflerentiable on int(domcp) = (0, +oo); 
(ii) cp is strictly convex on its domain; 
(iii) limt,o+ cpl(t) = -00; 
(iv) cp(1) = cpl(l) = 0 and cp1I(l) > 0; 
(v) There exists v E (;cpn(l), cp"(1)) such that 
Then the cp-divergence corresponding to a mapping cp E @ is defined by 
Sometimes condition (v) is not required in Definition 2.2. However, the 
corresponding convergence results are weaker without this additional property. 
Some examples of functions cp E @ are 
The graphs of these three functions are shown in the following figure. 

376 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
In particular, if we choose cp = cpl in the definition of d,, we obtain 
and this is precisely the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy function from (2.2). 
Using any pdivergence, we may try to solve the constrained minimization 
problem (1.2) by generating a sequence {xk) in such a way that xk+l solves 
the subproblem 
1 
min f(x)+-dp(x,xk), 
x > O  
Xk 
for k = 0,1,. . ., where so > 0 is any given starting point. For this method, 
Teboulle (1997) shows that it has the same global convergence properties as 
those mentioned in Theorem 2.1 for the classical proximal-point method. In 
addition, Teboulle (1997) also allows inexact solutions of the subproblems (2.4). 
The method may also be applied to the linearly constrained problem (1.3), and, 
once again, superlinear convergence can be shown under a certain error bound 
assumption, see Auslender and Haddou (1995) for details. Further references on 
cp-divergences include Csiszdr (1967); Eggermont (1990); Teboulle (1992); Iusem 
et al. (1994); Iusem, Teboulle (1995). 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
377 
2.4 Proximal-like Methods Using Quadratic Kernels and Regularization 
The method we describe in this subsection is taken from Auslender et al. 
(1999a) and based on earlier work by Tseng and Bertsekas (1993) and Ben 
Tal and Zibulevsky (1997). It can be motivated by using the ideas from the 
previous subsection. To this end, assume for a while that the mapping f from 
the linearly constrained optimization problem (1.3) is twice continuously differ- 
entiable. Then it is most natural to use Newton's method in order to minimize 
the objective function from the (essentially unconstrained) subproblem in (2.4) 
in order to obtain the next iterate in this way. Using Newton's method, how- 
ever, we need second order derivatives of these functions. In particular, we need 
second order derivatives of the function d, from Definition 2.2. Calculating the 
first derivative with respect to x, we obtain 
and calculating the second derivative gives 
where ei denotes the i-th unit vector in IRn. Hence, in each sum, we have the 
factor 
which increases to infinity during the iteration process for all indices 
i for which a constraint like xi 2 0 is active at a solution. Consequently, we 
therefore get Hessian matrices which are very ill-conditioned. 
In order to avoid this drawback, it is quite natural to modify the idea from 
the previous subsection in the following way: Let Q, be the class of functions 
from Definition 2.2 and set 
The difference to the pdivergence from the previous subsection is that we use 
yH instead of yi. Calculating the second order derivative of the mapping d, 
from (2.5) gives 
i.e., the crucial factor & vanishes completely. 

378 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Now consider the linearly constrained optimization problem (1.3), i.e., 
' 
con- 
sider the problem 
min f(x) s.t. g(x) 2 0, 
(2-6) 
with g(x) := b - ATx. Auslender et al. (1999a) consider an algorithm which 
defines a sequence {xk} in such a way that, given a strictly feasible starting 
point xO, the next iterate xk+' is computed as a solution of the subproblem 
1 
min f (x) + -d,, 
(g(x), g(xk)), g(x) > 0, 
x k  
where, of course, d,, denotes the mapping from (2.5). However, it turns out that 
this method has weaker global convergence properties than all other methods 
discussed so far, see Auslender et al. (1999a). 
In order to overcome this problem, Auslender et al. (1999a) suggest to use 
a regularization technique. More precisely, they suggest to add a quadratic 
penalty term to a function cp E 
(with 
being the set from Definition 2.2) in 
order to obtain a function $5 in this way. For example, using the three mappings 
(PI, 9 2 ,  cp3 from Subsection 2.3, we obtain 
for some constant v > 1. These functions are plotted in the following figure. 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
379 
Now, let $ denote any of these functions and set (similar to (2.5)) 
The regularized method from Auslender et al. (1999a) then generates a se- 
quence {x" 
by starting with a strictly feasible point x0 for problem (1.3) and 
by computing xk+l as the solution of the subproblem 
1 
min f (x) + -d@ (g(x), dx") , g(x) > 0. 
Xk 
(2.7) 
Then the following result was shown in Auslender et al. (1999a). 
Theorem 2.2 Let {xk} be a sequence generated by the above method. Assume 
that the following assumptions are satisfied: 
(A.l) There exist constants Amax 2 Xmi, > 0 such that Xk E [Amin, Amax] for all 
k E IN. 
(A.2) The optimal value f, := inf{f (x) I ATx 5 b} is finite. 
(A.3) dom(f) n int{x I ATx I b} is nonempty. 
(A.4) The matrix A has rank n. 
Then the following statements hold: 
The sequence of function values {f (xk)} converges to the optimal value 
f*. 
If S # 0, then the entire sequence {x" 
converges to an element of S. 
The rank assumption (A.4) is satisfied, e.g., if A = I ,  i.e., if the feasible set 
is the nonnegative orthant. Moreover, this rank condition can be assumed to 
hold without loss of generality for linear programs if we view (1.3) as the dual 
of a standard form linear program. 
2.5 Infeasible Proximal-like Methods 
Consider again the linearly constrained minimization problem (1.3). The meth- 
ods described in the previous subsections all assume, among other things, that 

380 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
the interior of the feasible set is nonempty. Moreover, it is assumed that we can 
find a strictly feasible point in order to start the algorithm. However, for linear 
constraints, it is usually not easy to find such a starting point. Furthermore, 
there do exist convex optimization problems which are solvable but whose in- 
terior of the feasible region is empty. In this case, it is not possible to apply 
one of the methods from the previous subsections. 
Yamashita et al. (2001) therefore describe an infeasible proximal-like method 
which can be started from an arbitrary point and which avoids the assumption 
that the interior of the feasible set is nonempty. The idea behind the method 
from Yamashita et al. (2001) is to enlarge the feasible set 
of the original minimization problem (1.3) by introducing a perturbation vector 
Sk > 0 and by replacing X at each iteration k by an enlarged region of the form 
Note that X # 0 then implies int(Xk) # 0. Hence we can apply the previous 
method to the enlarged problem 
min f(x) s.t. x E X k .  
The fact that the method from the previous subsection uses a quadratic penalty 
term actually fits perfectly into our situation where we allow infeasible iterates. 
Obviously, we can hope that we obtain a solution of the original problem 
(1.3) by letting Sk + 0. To be more precise, let us define 
and let xk+l be a solution of the subproblem 
for some perturbation vector Sk > 0. Then is has been shown in Yamashita et 
al. (2001) that the statements of Theorem 2.2 remain true under a certain set 
of assumptions. However, without going into the details, we stress that these 
assumptions include the condition dom(f) n {x I ATx < b) # 0 (in contrast to 
(A.3) which assumes that the domain off intersected with the interior of the 
feasible set is nonempty). On the other hand, the main convergence result in 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
381 
Yamashita et al. (2001) has to impose another condition which eventually guar- 
antees that the iterates {xk} generated by the infeasible proximal-like method 
become feasible in the limit point.

NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR SOME OPTIMAL CONTROL 
PROBLEMS 
3.1 Description of Test Problems 
We consider two classes of optimal control problems. The first class contains 
control constraints, the second one involves state constraints. 
The class of control constrained problems is as follows: Let R 5 IRn be an 
open and bounded domain and consider the minimization problem 
where y = y(u) E Hi(0) denotes the weak solution of Poisson's equation 
-Ay = u on 0 and yd, ud, $J E L2(R) are given square-integrable functions. 
Here y is the state and u is the control variable. The meaning of (3.1) is that 
we want to minimize the distance to a desired state yd (hence the subscript 
'd') subject to some constraints on the control u. The penalty term in the 
objective function J is a standard regularization term multiplied by a small 
constant a > 0. 
The following two particular instances of the class of problems (3.1) will be 
used in our numerical tests; they are taken from Bergounioux et al. (2001). 
Example 3.1 Consider the following two instances: 
(a) Consider problem (3.1) with the following data: 

382 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
(b) Consider problem (3.1) with the following data: 
In order to deal with this problem numerically, we discretize the domain 
R = (0, 1)2 by using an equidistant ( N  x N)-grid. The Laplacian was approx- 
imated by using the standard 5-point finite difference scheme. After shifting 
the variables in order to get nonnegativity constraints, we then obtain an op- 
timization problem of the form (1.2). 
The second class of problems we will deal with is the state constrained prob- 
lem 
min ~ ( u )  
:= f ~IY(u) - ~ d l l $ ( ~ )  + $ 1 1 ~  - ~ d l l $ ( ~ )  
s.t. 
u ~ F : = { u ~ ~ ~ ( R ) l y < c j o n R } ,  
(3.2) 
where we used the same notation as for the control constrained problem, i.e., 
y = y(u) E Hi(R) denotes the weak solution of Poisson's equation -Ay = 
u on R, yd, ud, cj E L2(R) are given functions, and a > 0 is a small regulariza- 
tion parameter. Note that the only difference between problems (3.1) and (3.2) 
is that we have different constraints. 
The particular instance of problem (3.2) we are interested in is also taken 
from Bergounioux et al. (2001). 
Example 3.2 Consider problem (3.2) with the following data: 
In order to deal with the state constrained problem (3.2), we use the same 
discretization scheme as for the control constrained problem (3.1). In this case, 
however, this results in a linearly constrained optimization problem of the form 
(1.3), and it is in general not easy to find a strictly feasible starting point. 

PROXIMAL-LIKE METHODS 
383 
3.2 Numerical Results for Control Constrained Problems 
We begin with a word of caution: The numerical results presented in this and 
the next subsection are not intended to show that proximal-point methods are 
the best methods for solving the two classes of optimal control problems from 
the previous subsection. The only thing we want to do is to provide a brief 
comparison between some of the different proximal-like methods for the solution 
of these problems in order to get some hints which proximal-like methods seem 
to work best. 
All methods were implemented in MATLAB and use the same parameter 
setting whenever this was possible. The particular methods we consider in this 
subsection for the solution of the control constrained problem (3.1) are the 
proximal-like methods from Subsections 2.3 (p-divergences) and 2.4 (quadratic 
kernels with regularization term). The unconstrained minimization is always 
carried out by applying Newton's method. For reasons explained earlier, we 
took the function 9 2  in combination with the proximal-like method from Sub- 
section 2.3, and the corresponding mapping & for the regularized method from 
Subsection 2.4. 
Table 3.2 contains the numerical results for Example 3.1 (a) for different sizes 
of N (the dimension of the discretized problem is n = N2). This table contains 
the cumulated number of inner iterations, i.e., we present the total number of 
Newton steps and therefore the total number of linear system solves for each 
test problem. Both methods seem to work reasonably well, and the number of 
iterations is more or less independent from the mesh size. However, the number 
of iterations using the p-divergence approach is significantly higher than the 
number of iterations for the regularized approach. The resulting optimal control 
and state for Example 3.1 (a) are given in Figures 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. 
The observation is similar for Example 3.1 (b) as shown in Table 3.2, al- 
though this time the number of iterations needed by the two methods is pretty 
much the same. The resulting optimal control and states for these two examples 
are given in Figures 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. 
We also tested both methods on Example 3.1 (a) using smaller values of a. 
Due to the quadratic penalty term in the regularized method, we do expect 
a better behaviour for this method. This is indeed reflected by the numerical 
results shown in Table 3.4.

FINAL REMARKS 
In this paper, we presented several proximal-like methods for the solution of 
convex minimization problems. A particular class of convex problems are the 
so-called semi-definite programs, see Nesterov and Nemirovskii (1994) for ex- 
ample. The main difference between semi-definite programs and a convex min- 
imization problem of the form (1.1), say, is the fact that the variables in semi- 
definite programs are matrices, more precisely, symmetric positive semi-definite 
matrices. As far as the author is aware of, proximal-like methods have not been 
applied to semi-definite programs so far. However, due to the recent interest in 
semi-definite programs (mainly in the field of interior-point analysis), it might 
be a very useful research topic to see how proximal-like methods can be ex- 
tended to semi-definite programs and how these methods behave for this class 
of convex problems.

Abstract: 
The purpose of this work is to carry out the analysis of two- 
dimensional scalar variational problems by the method of moments. 
This 
method is indeed shown to be useful for treating general cases in which the 
Lagrangian is a separable polynomial in the derivative variables. In these cases, 
it follows that the discretization of these problems can be reduced to a single 
large scale semidefinite program. 
Key words: Calculus of variations, young measures, the method of moments, 
semidefinite programming, microstructure, non linear elasticity.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The classical theory of variational calculus does not provide any satisfactory 
methods to analyze non-convex variational problems expressed in the form 
where f is a coercive non-convex Lagrangian function, and u the family of all 
admissible scalar functions defined on 0. For a review on recent methods in the 
calculus of variations see Dacorogna (1989). 
In order to analyze this class of non-convex variational problems, we must 
appeal to a new formulation with respect to Young measures. For these prob- 
lems we introduce the generalized functional 
is a parametrized family of probability measures supported on the plane. Each 
one of these sets v is called a Young measure, hence the generalized functional 
is defined in the family of all Young measures v. 
Young measures theory predicts that the generalized functional (1.2) has a 
Young measure minimizer 
which provides information about the limit behavior of the minimizing se- 
quences of the functional I given in (1.1). Thus, 
in measure, whenever un is a minimizing sequence for the functional I. One 
immediate conclusion is that functional I has a unique minimizer if and only 
- 
if the generalized functional I has a minimizer v* composed only of Dirac 
measures. In this case 
PZ,Y 
= %qx,y) 
where G is a minimizer for I. For a thorough study on Young measures and 
calculus of variations see Pedregal (1997). 

2D NON CONVEX VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS 
395 
In the present work, we will study the particular case in which the Lagrangian 
function f takes the polynomial separable form 
Under this assumption, Problem (1.2) may be reduced to a single semidefinite 
program using the theory of the classical problem of moments and elementary 
convex analysis. 
The present paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we will see a short 
review on the use of the Method of Moments for treating one dimensional 
non convex variational problems. In Section 3 we will see how the Method of 
Moments is used for analyzing the convex envelope of one-dimensional algebraic 
polynomials. Section 4 describes the general analysis of two dimensional non 
convex variational problems by the Method of Moments. Section 5 shows how 
transform the analytical formulation into a particular mathematical program. 
In Section 6 we will see some examples in detail and finally Section 7 gives some 
comments about the interplay of this work with pure and applied mathematics.

where mk (x) are the algebraic moments of the parametrized measures p, which 
form the one-dimensional Young measure 
The theory of moments provides a good characterization for the algebraic 
moments of positive measures supported on the real line. Therefore we can 
study the one-dimensional generalized problem (2.2) by solving the optimiza- 
tion problem (2.3). Here we will study two-dimensional problems defined by 
separable polynomials in the form (1.4). 
For a short review on applications of the method of moments for one- 
dimensional non-convex variational problems see Meziat et a1 (2001). The es- 
sential facts about the characterization of one-dimensional algebraic moments 
are exposed in Akhiezer and Krein (1962). The difficulties about the charac- 
terization of two-dimensional algebraic moments are explained in Berg et a1 
(1979).

CONVEX ENVELOPES 
Given a one-dimensional polynomial (2.1), its convex envelope may be defined 
where p represents the family of all probability measures with mean t. In this 
approach, every probability measure represents a convex combination of points 
on the real line. Therefore, the measure 
which solves (3.1), represents the convex combination which satisfies 
From this point of view, it is clear that optimal measure ,G has a very precise 
geometric meaning. Here we have assumed that ,?i 
is supported in two points 
at the most, because of Caratheodory's theorem in convex analysis. 
Since f is a polynomial function in the form (2.1), every integral in (3.1) 
can be written as 

2D NON CONVEX VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS 
397 
where values mo, . . . , rn2, are the algebraic moments of measure p. So we can 
express the convex envelope of f using the next semidefinite program

where we have used the classical representation of one-dimensional algebraic 
moments: The convex cone of positive definite Hankel matrices H = (mk+l)L,l=O 
is the interior of the convex cone of algebraic moments (mo,. . . ,man) of posi- 
tive measures supported on the real line. For more details we refer the reader 
to Akhiezer and Krein (1962). 
By using an elementary algebraic procedure, we can obtain the optimal mea- 
sure ji for problem (3.1) from the optimal values fi2,. . . , fian of the semidefinite 
program (3.3). Indeed, if f i 2  = t2, take 
so the optimal measure ji is equal to the Dirac measure 
Otherwise, take tl and t2 as the roots of the polynomial 
and denote by XI, X2 the quantities 
where tl < t < t2. Using these values in the expression (3.2), we obtain the 
optimal measure ji. It is remarkable that only three moments are needed for 
recovering the optimal measure ji. Finally, we conclude that Problem (3.1) and 
Problem (3.3) are equivalent. For additional details see Pedregal et a1 (2003)

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
When f is a two-dimensional separable polynomial with the form (1.4), its 
convex envelope is defined as 
where p represents the family of all probability measures supported in the plane 
satisfying 
Note that it is analogous to the definition of convex envelopes for one-dimensional 
functions. 
However, in order to estimate the convex envelope of the separable polyno- 
mial f, we must use another well known result of convex analysis: the convex 
envelope of a separable function is the sum of the convex envelopes of its compo- 
nents. See Dacorogna (1989). From this result and the explanation on convex 
envelopes of one-dimensional polynomials given above, one observes that the 
convex envelope of f is given by the semidefinite program

The optimal values m 2 , .  . . , .iiz2,,fi,. . . ,P2r for problem (3.5) allow us to de- 
termine the optimal probability measure ,!i which satisfies (3.4). 
From a practical point of view, ,!i is the direct product of two independent 
one-dimensional distributions ,!ix and jiy, so we have 

2D NON CONVEX VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS 
399 
where jix represents the convex envelope of the first polynomial 
in (1.4) and respectively, p y  represents the convex envelope of the second poly- 
nomial 
2r 
in (1.4). Thus, marginal distributions px and p y  are obtained from values 
s,jfL2,jfL3 and t,ji2,fi respectively, in the same way that we did for the one- 
dimensional case. In other words, there is no essential difference between the 
one-dimensional polynomial case (2.1) and the two-dimensional separable poly- 
nomial case (1.4) . Finally, it is very important to note that the optimal measure 
p = fix x ,!iy determines the convex combination which defines the convex en- 
velope of the separable polynomial f at the point (s, t) .

PROBLEM ANALYSIS 
Our concern here is the analysis of non-convex variational problems like 
min I (u) = 
u 
i f ( d u ( x , y ) ) d x d y  
s.t. 
u l m = g .  
(4.1) 
We will study the case where f is a two-dimensional separable polynomial in 
the general form (1.4). We first notice that direct discretization of functional I 
in (4.1) provides a non-convex optimization problem which is not particularly 
adequate to be solved by standard numerical optimization software. The reason 
behind that is the lack of convexity on f, which can cause the search algorithm 
to stop at some wrong local minima instead of providing the right global min- 
ima for the functional I. In addition, we must consider the possibility that I 
lacks minimizers on the space of admissible functions. Normally, admissible 
functions belong to the Sobolev space witp (a) + g where index p depends on 
the integrand function f in (4.1). 
To overcome this difficulty we study the generalized problem 

400 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
whose solution in Young measures provides information about the minimizers 
of the original functional I. By using the separable polynomial structure of f, 
we can transform the generalized functional in (4.2) into the functional

in the Young measure v. In this way, 
we must solve the optimization problem 
where the new sets of variables m and p must be characterized as the algebraic 
moments of one-dimensional probability measure. In order to do so, we impose 
the linear matrix inequalities

for every point (x, y) E R. After an appropriate discretization, this problem can 
be posed as a single semidefinite program. See Vandenverghe and Boyd (1996) 
and Boyd et a1 (1994) for an introduction to semidefinite programming. 
5 
DISCRETE AND FINITE MODEL 
Here we will transform the optimization problem (4.3) subject to the con- 
straints (4.4), into an equivalent discrete mathematical program. First, we 
take a finite set of N points on the domain R indexed by lc, that is 

2D NON CONVEX VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS 
401 
Next, for every discrete point (xk, yk) we take the algebraic moments 
of the respective parametrized measure pzk,yk. 
Using the 2N x (n + r )  variables 
listed in (5.2), we can express the functional J in the discrete form: 
The constraints (4.4) form a set of linear matrix inequalities for every point in 
0 ,  hence they should keep the same for every point (xk, yk) in the mesh (5.1). 
So we have a set of 2N linear matrix inequalities expressed as 
where mo = 1 and po = 1 for every k = 1,. . . , N. 
In order to impose the boundary conditions 
and the constraints 
in (4.3), we use the following fact: Given any Jordan curve C inside the domain 
0 ,  the restriction (5.5) implies 
where (xo, yo) and (xf , yf) are two endpoints of curve C. 
We shall select a finite collection of M curves CL with 1 = 1,. . . , M which, in 
some sense, sweep the whole domain 0 .  It will suffice that each point (xk, yk) 
on the mesh belongs to at least one curve CL. In order to impose the boundary 
conditions in (4.3), every curve Cl must link two boundary points of R. So we 
obtain a new set of M constraints in the form 
which can be incorporated as linear equalities in the discrete model. 

402 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
We can see that optimization problem (4.3) can be transformed into a single 
semidefinite program after discretization. Note that objective function Jd in 
(5.3) is a linear function of the variables in (5.2). Those variables are restricted 
by the set of 2N linear matrix inequalities given in (5.4) and the set of M linear 
equations given in (5.6). Thus, we have obtained a very large single semidefinite 
program.

EXAMPLES 
To illustrate the method proposed in this work, we will analyze the non-convex 
variational problem 
under the following boundary conditions 
The corresponding generalized problem has the form 
minv S[-l,l12 {sn2 
((1 - u2) + Y2) d k y  (0, Y)} dx dY 
under the constraint (g , g) = JR2 ( 0 , ~ )

and the boundary conditions ulan = g (x) 
with 0  = [-1 , 11" 
(6.1) 
which transforms into the optimization problem

2 
and the boundary 
conditions ulan = g (x) 
with 0 =  [- 1 , 1 ] . 
(6.2) 
In order to perform the discretization of this problem, we use the straight 
lines with slope 1 crossing the square [-I, 112. With them we can impose the 
boundary conditions in the finite model. After solving the discrete model, not 
to be exposed here, we obtain the optimal moments for (6.2), and the Young 
measure solution for the generalized problem (6.1). 

2D NON CONVEX VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS 
403 
For the three cases studied, we obtain the following optimal parametrized 
c) P s , ~  
= d(1,o) 
VX, Y E [-I, 112 
hence we infer that Problem a) does not have minimizers, Problem b) has the 
minimizer ii (x, y) = 1 - 1x1 and Problem c) has the minimizer 
(x, y) = x + 1. 
Although Problem a) lacks minimizers, the optimal Young measure obtained 
gives enough information about the limit behavior of the minimizing sequences. 
Indeed, if un is an arbitrary minimizing sequence for Problem a) we have 
in measure, where gradient (1,O) is preferred with 50% of possibilities and 
gradient (-1,O) is preferred with the remaining 50% of possibilities in the 
2 
minimizing process, for every point (x, y) E [-I, 11 . 
7 CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The major contribution of this work is that it settles the way for studying non- 
convex variational problems of the form (4.1) . Indeed, the direct method of the 
calculus of variations does not provide any answer for them if the integrand f 
is not convex. See Dacorogna (1989). In addition, in this work we propose a 
method for solving generalized problems like (4.2) when the integrand f has the 
separable form described in (1.4). In fact to the best knowledge of the author, 
do not exist other proposals to analyze this kind of generalized problems in two 
dimensions. 
An important remark about this work is that we have reduced the origi- 
nal non convex variational problem (4.1) to the optimization problem (4.3). 
In addition, the reader should note that Problem (4.3) is a convex problem 
because the objective function is linear and the feasible set convex. That is 
a remarkable qualitative difference since numerical implementation of problem 
(4.1) may provide wrong answers when the search algorithm stops in local min- 
ima, whereas a good implementation of Problem (4.3) should yield the global 
minima of the problem. 

404 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Since we can pose Problem (4.3) as a single large scale semidefinite program, 
we can use existing software for solving non convex variational problems in 
the form (4.1) whenever the integrand f has the separable form (1.4). This 
situation prompts further research on large scale semidefinite programming 
specially suited for generalized problems in the form (4.3) . 
We should also stress that, although the original non convex variational prob- 
lem (4.1) may not have a solution, its new formulation (4.3) always has one. In 
general, this solution is unique and provides information about the existence of 
minimizers for problem (4.1) . If Problem (4.1) has a unique minimizer Zi (x, y) , 
then Problem (4.3) provides the moments of the Dirac measures 
Moreover, if Problem (4.3) provides the moments of a family of Dirac measures 
like 
then problem (4.1) has a unique minimizer a (x, y) which satisfies 
(x, y) = 
3 
(x, 9). 
One fundamental question we feel important to raise is whether the discrete 
model (5.3) is an adequate representation of the convex problem (4.3). From 
an analytical point of view, we need to find a particular qualitative feature on 
the solution of Problem (4.3), that is the Dirac mass condition on all optimal 
measures. So we can hope that even rough numerical models can provide us 
with the right qualitative answer about the existence of minimizers for the non 
convex variational problem (4.1). This has actually been observed in many 
numerical experiments. 
It is also extremely remarkable that we can get a numerical answer to an 
analytical question. Indeed, we are clarifying the existence of minimizers of 
one particular variational problem from a numerical procedure. This point is 
crucial because no analytical method exists which allows to solve this question 
when we are coping with general non convex variational problems. 
On the other hand, we really need a fine numerical model because the solu- 
tion of problem (4.3) contains the information about the oscillatory behavior 
of minimizing sequences of the non convex problem (4.1). In those cases where 
Problem (4.1) lacks solution, minimizing sequences show similar oscillatory be- 
havior linked with important features in the physical realm. For example, in

elasticity models of solid mechanics such behavior represents the distribution 
of several solid phases inside some particular body. This information provides 
the microstructure of the crystalline net of the material. 
To discover such phenomena we need a good representation of the optimal 
Young measure of the generalized problem (4.2), which in turns, is embedded 
into the solution of the convex formulation in moments (4.3). In conclusion, 
we feel that it is important to devise a good numerical treatment of problem 
(4.3) by solving a semidefinite model like (5.3).

Abstract: We present a survey of the main results about asymptotic stability, 
exponential stability and monotone attractors of locally and globally projected 
dynamical systems, whose stationary points coincide with the solutions of a 
corresponding variational inequality. In particular, we show that the global 
monotone attractors of locally projected dynamical systems are characterized by 
the solutions of a corresponding Minty variational inequality. Finally, we discuss 
two special cases: when the domain is a polyhedron, the stability analysis for 
a locally projected dynamical system, at regular solutions to the associated 
variational inequality, is reduced to one of a standard dynamical system of 
lower dimension; when the vector field is linear, some global stability results, 
for locally and globally projected dynamical systems, are proved if the matrix 
is positive definite (or strictly copositive when the domain is a convex cone). 
Key words: Variational inequality, projected dynamical system, equilibrium 
solution, stability analysis.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Equilibrium is a central concept in the study of complex and competitive sys- 
tems. Examples of well-known equilibrium problems include oligopolistic mar- 
ket equilibrium and traffic network equilibrium problems. For these problems 
many variational formulations have been introduced in the last years, neverthe- 
less their analysis is focused on the static study of the equilibrium, while it is 
also of interest to analyse the time evolution of adjustment processes for these 
equilibrium problems. Recently, two models for studying dynamic behaviour 
of such systems have been proposed: they are based on constrained dynamical 
systems involving projection operators. The first one is the so-called locally 
projected dynamical system (first proposed in Dupuis et a1 (1993)), the other 
is known as globally projected dynamical system (introduced in Friesz et a1 
(1994)). The most important connection between these dynamical models and 
variational models lies is the possibility of characterizing stationary points for 
dynamical models by solutions of a particular variational inequality. The lo- 
cally projected dynamical systems have had recently important applications in 
economics (see Dong et a1 (1996), Nagurney et a1 (1996a) and Nagurney et 
a1 (199613)) and in the traffic networks equilibrium problems (see Nagurney et 
a1 (1997a), Nagurney et a1 (199713) and Nagurney et a1 (1998)); the globally 
projected dynamical systems have been introduced as a model for describing 
network disequilibria (see Friesz et a1 (1994)) and they have been applied to 
neural networks for solving a class of optimization problems (see Xia et a1 
(2000)). 
The main purpose of this paper is to give, to the best of my knowledge, a 
survey of the main results about the stability of these two types of projected 
dynamical systems (see Nagurney et a1 (1995) and Nagurney et a1 (1996c), Pap- 
palardo et al (2002) and Xia et al (2000)). The paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we recall the definitions of locally and globally projected dynamical 
systems and we show the equivalence between their equilibrium points and the 
solutions of a suitable associated variational inequality. In Section 3, we recall 
some stability definitions needed throughout the paper (monotone attractor, 
asymptotic stability, exponential stability); we show some stability results for 
a locally projected dynamical system under monotonicity assumptions on the 
vector field; we state the correspondence between the global monotone attrac- 
tors of a locally projected dynamical system and the solutions to a related

Minty variational inequality; we give asymptotic and exponential stability re- 
sults for a globally projected dynamical system when the jacobian matrix of the 
vector field is symmetric; finally we provide a stability result, for both the pro- 
jected dynamical systems, similar to the nonlinear sink theorem for standard 
dynamical systems. Section 4 is dedicated to the stability analysis in two spe- 
cial cases. When the domain is a convex polyhedron, the stability of a locally 
projected dynamical system, at regular solutions to the associated variational 
inequality, is essentially the same as that of a standard dynamical system of 
lower dimension, the so-called minimal face flow. When the vector field is lin- 
ear and the matrix is positive definite (or strictly copositive if the domain is a 
convex cone), the global exponential stability for locally and globally projected 
dynamical systems is proved. Finally, some suggestions for future research in 
the linear case are described.

VARIATIONAL AND DYNAMICAL MODELS 
Throughout this paper K denotes a closed convex subset of Rn and 
F : Rn -+ Rn a vector field. The following monotonicity definitions will be 
needed for our later discussions. 
Definition 2.1 F is said to be locally pseudomonotone at x* i f  there is a neigh- 
borhood N(x*) of x* such that 
(F(x*), x - x*) 2 0, + (F(x), x - x*) 2 0, 
Q x E N(x*), 
where (., .) denotes the inner product in Rn; 
F is said to be pseudomonotone on K if 
F is said to be locally strictly pseudomonotone at x* i f  there is a neighborhood 
N(x*) of x* such that 
(F(x*),x - x*) 2 0, + (F(x),x - x*) > 0, 
V x E N(x*); 
F is said to be strictly pseudomonotone on K i f  
F is said to be monotone on K if 

410 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
F is said to be locally strongly monotone at x* if there is a neighborhood N(x*) 
of x* and v >  0 such that 
(F(x) - F(x*),x - x*) 2 qllx - x*1I2, V x E N(x*); 
F is said to be strongly monotone on K i f  there is q > 0 such that 
We recall that a variational inequality of Stampacchia-type SVI(F,K) con- 
sists in determining a vector x* E K ,  such that 
(F(x*),x - x*) 2 0, 
V x E K ;  
the associated Minty variational inequality MVI(F,K) consists in finding a vec- 
tor x* E K ,  such that 
It is well-known that if F is continuous on K ,  then each solution to MVI(F,K) 
is a solution to SVI(F,K); whereas if F is pseudomonotone on K ,  then each 
solution to SVI(F,K) is also a solution to MVI(F,K). 
The first dynamical model we consider in this context is the so-called locally 
projected dynamical system (first introduced in Dupuis et a1 (1993)), denoted 
by LPDS(F,K), which is defined by the following ordinary differential equation 
where TK(x) denotes the tangent cone to K at x, Ps denotes the usual projec- 
tion on a closed convex subset S: 
Ps(x) = argmin llx - 211, 
Z E S  
and 1 1  . 1 1  is the euclidean norm on Rn. 
We remark that if the vector field F is continuous on K ,  then the right- 
hand side of LPDS(F,K) is also continuous on the relative interior of K ,  and it 
can be discontinuous elsewhere. By a solution to the LPDS(F,K) we mean an 
absolutely continuous function x : [0, +oo) -+ K such that 
for all t 2 0 save on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. 

VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS 
41 1 
We are interested in the equilibrium (or stationary) points of LPDS(F,K), 
i.e. the vectors x* E K such that 
that is once a solution of the LPDS(F,K) is at x*, it will remain at x* for 
all future times. The first connection between the locally projected dynamical 
systems and the variational inequalities is that the stationary points of the 
LPDS(F,K) coincide with the solutions of SVI(F,K). This equivalence allows 
us to carry out a stability analysis of a solution to SVI(F,K) respect to the 
dynamical system LPDS(F,K), as we will see in Section 3. 
Since the main purpose of this paper is to analyse the stability of the equi- 
librium points, we confine ourself to cite only the following result about the 
existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial value of solu- 
tions to LPDS(F,K), in the special case where K is a polyhedron (see Nagurney 
et a1 (1996~)). 
Theorem 2.1 Let K be a polyhedron. If there exists a constant M > 0 such 
that 
IIF(x)II I M (1 + IIxII), 
v x E K, 
then 
for any xo E K, there exists a unique solution xo(t) to LPDS(F,K), such 
that xo(0) = xo; 
if xn + xo as n + +GO, then x, (t) converges to xo (t) uniformly on every 
compact set of [0, +GO). 
We note that Lipschitz continuity of F on K is a sufficient condition for the 
properties stated in Theorem 2.1. 
The second dynamical model we consider is the so-called globally projected 
dynamical system, denoted by GPDS(F,K,a), which is defined as the following 
ordinary differential equation 

412 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
where a is a positive constant. If the vector field F is continuous on K ,  then 
the right-hand side of GPDS(F,K,a) is also continuous on K, but it can be 
different from -a F(x) even if x is an interior point to K. Hence the solutions 
of GPDS(F,K,a) and LPDS(F,K) are different in general. 
The following result about global existence and uniqueness of solutions to 
GPDS(F,K,a) follows on the ordinary differential equations theory (see Xia et 
a1 (2000)). 
Theorem 2.2 If F is locally Lipschitz continuous and there exists a constant 
M > 0 such that 
IIF(x)II I M (1 + IIxII), 
Q x E K, 
then for any xo E K there exists a unique solution xo(t) for GPDS(F,K,a), 
such that xo(0) = xo, that is defined for all t E R. 
It can be proved that, as in the case of LPDS(F,K), a solution to GPDS(F,K,a) 
starting from a point in K has to remain in K (see Xia et a1 (2000) and Pap- 
palardo et al (2002)). 
The equilibrium (or stationary) points of GPDS(F,K,a) are naturally defined 
as the vectors x* E K such that 
PK (x* - a F(x*)) = x*. 
It is easy to check that they also coincide with the solutions to SVI(F,K). Hence, 
we can analyse the stability of the solutions to SVI(F,K) also respect to the 
dynamical system GPDS(F,K,a). 
3 
STABILITY ANALYSIS 
We have seen that LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a) have the same stationary 
points, but, in general, their solutions are different. In this section we analyse 
the stability of these equilibrium points, namely we wish to know the behaviour 
of the solutions, of LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a) respectively, which start near 
an equilibrium point. Since we are mainly focused on the stability issue, we 
can assume the property of existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy 
problems corresponding to locally and globally projected dynamical systems. 
In the following, B(x*, r) denotes the open ball with center x* and radius r. 
Now we recall some definitions on stability. 
Definition 3.1 Let x* be a stationary point of LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a). 

VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS 
413 
x* is called stable if for any E > 0, there exists 6 > 0 such that for every 
solution x(t), with x(0) E B(x*, 6) n K ,  one has x(t) E B(x*, E )  for all t 2 0; 
x* is said asymptotically stable i f  x* is stable and lim x(t) = x* for every 
t-++oo 
solution x(t), with x(0) E B(x*,6) n K ;  x* is said globally asymptotically 
stable i f  it is stable and lim x(t) = x* for every solution x(t) with x(0) E K .  
t-+w 
We recall also that x* is called monotone attractor if there exists 6 > 0 such 
that, for every solution x(t) with x(0) E B(x*, 6) n K ,  the euclidean distance 
between x(t) and x*, that is Ilx(t) - x*ll, is a nonincreasing function of t; 
whereas x* is said strictly monotone attractor if Ilx(t) - x*ll is decreasing to 
zero in t. Moreover x* is a (strictly) global monotone attractor i f  the same 
properties hold for any solution x(t) such that x(0) E K .  
Finally, x* is a finite-time attractor if there is 6 > 0 such that, for every 
solution x(t), with x(0) E B(x*, 6) n K ,  there exists some T < +oo such that 
x(t) = x* for all t 2 T .  
I t  is trivial to remark that the monotone attractors are stable equilibrium 
points, whereas the strictly monotone attractors and the finite-time attractors 
are asymptotically stable ones. 
I t  is easy to check that the stability of a locally (or globally) projected 
dynamical system can differ from the stability of a standard dynamical system 
in the same vector field (see examples in Nagurney et a1 (1995)). 
The pseudo-monotonicity property of F is directly related to the monotone 
attractors of LPDS(F,K), as shown in the following theorem which is a direct 
generalization of a result proved in Nagurney et a1 (1995). 
Theorem 3.1 Let x* be a stationary point of LPDS(F,K). If F is locally 
(strictly) pseudomonotone at x*, then x* is a (strictly) monotone attractor 
for LPDS(F,K); if F is (strictly) pseudomonotone on K ,  then x* is a (strictly) 
global monotone attractor for LPDS(F,K). 
However, the monotonicity of F is not sufficient to prove the stability for 
an equilibrium point of a globally projected dynamical system, as the following 
example shows (for the details see Xia et a1 (2000)). 

414 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Example 3.1 We consider K = { x  E R3 : -10 5 xi 5 lo), a = 1 and 
F ( x )  = A x  + b, where 
The afine vector field F is monotone, because A is positive semidefinite, but 
the unique equilibrium point of GPDS(F,K,a), i.e. x* = (0.5, -0.5, -2)T, is 
not stable. 
In addition to the monotonicity of F ,  the symmetry of the jacobian matrix 
of F ,  denoted by J F ,  is necessary in order to achieve the asymptotic stability 
of a stationary point of a globally projected dynamical system (see Xia et a1 
(2000)). 
Theorem 3.2 Let x* be the unique stationary point of GPDS(F,K,a). If F is 
monotone on K and the jacobian matrix JF is symmetric on an open convex 
set including K ,  then x* is globally asymptotically stable for GPDS(F,K,a) for 
any a > 0. 
We remark that under the assumptions of Theorem 3.2, the vector field F 
is the gradient map of a real convex function on K .  
Now we go back to the monotone attractors. When the vector filed F is 
continuous, there is a further connection between locally projected dynam- 
ical systems and variational inequalities: the global monotone attractors of 
LPDS(F,K) are equivalent to the solutions of the Minty variational inequality 
MVI(F,K) (see Pappalardo et a1 (2002)). 
Theorem 3.3 Let F be continuous on K .  Then x* E K is a global monotone 
attractor for LPDS(F,K) if and only if it is solution to MVI(F,K). 
We remark that Theorem 3.3 does not hold for globally projected dynamical 
systems: the following example (see Pappalardo et a1 (2002)) shows that the so- 
lutions to MVI(F,K) are not necessarily monotone attractors of GPDS(F,K,a), 
even if the vector field F is continuous on K .  
Example 3.2 We consider K = R: and the vector field 

VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS 
415 
The point x* = ( O , O ) ~  is solution to MVI(F,K), but it is not a monotone 
attractor for GPDS(F,K,a) for any fixed a > 0. 
Another stability type we consider is the so-called exponential stability. 
Definition 3.2 Let x* be a stationary point of LPDS(F, K )  and GPDS(F, K,a). 
It is said exponentially stable, if the solutions starting from points close to x* 
are convergent to x* with exponential rate, that is if there is 6 > 0 and two 
constants a > 0 and C > 0 such that for every solution x(t), with x(0) E 
B(x*, 6) n K ,  one has 
x* is globally exponentially stable if (3.1) holds for all solutions x(t) such that 
x(0) E K .  
We remark that a strictly monotone attractor is not necessarily exponentially 
stable and vice versa (see examples in Pappalardo et a1 (2002)). 
The exponential stability of a stationary point of LPDS(F,K) is proved under 
the strong monotonicity assumption of the vector field F (see Nagurney et a1 
(1995) and Nagurney et a1 (1996~)). 
Theorem 3.4 Let x* be a stationary point of LPDS(F,K). If F is locally 
strongly monotone at x*, then x* is a strictly monotone attractor and expo- 
nentially stable for LPDS(F,K); i f  F is strongly monotone on K ,  then x* 
is a strictly global monotone attractor and globally exponentially stable for 
LPDS(F, K). 
The strong monotonicity and the Lipschitz continuity of F give the expo- 
nential stability of a stationary point of GPDS(F,K,a), provided that a is small 
enough (see Pappalardo et a1 (2002)). 
Theorem 3.5 Let x* be a stationary point of GPDS(F,K,a). If F is locally 
strongly monotone at x* with constant q, and locally Lipschitz continuous at 
x* with constant L, then x* is a strictly monotone attractor and exponentially 
stable for GPDS(F,K,a), provided that a < 2q/L2; i f  F is strongly monotone 
on K with constant q and locally Lipschitz continuous on K with constant L, 
then x* is a strictly global monotone attractor and globally exponentially stable 
for GPDS(F, K p ) ,  provided that a < 2q/L2. 

416 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
The global exponential stability for GPDS(F,K,a), where a is small enough, 
has been proved even when the jacobian matrix J F  is symmetric and positive 
definite (see Xia et a1 (2000)). 
Theorem 3.6 Let x* be a stationary point of GPDS(F,K,a). If J F  is symmet- 
ric and uniformly positive definite in Rn, 1 1  JFll has an upper bound, then x* is 
globally exponentially stable for GPDS(F,K,a), provide thata < 21 max 1 1  JF(x)II. 
xERn 
A further result on the exponential stability for globally projected dynamical 
systems can be proved when the jacobian matrix J F  is not symmetric, but the 
domain K is bounded (see Xia et a1 (2000)). 
Theorem 3.7 Let x* be a stationary point of GPDS(F,K,a). If K is bounded, 
F is continuously differentiable on K and J F  is positive definite on K ,  then 
there exists a0 > 0 such that x* is globally exponentially stable for GPDS(F,K,a) 
for any a < ao. 
Now we present a stability result for LPDS(F,K) analogous to the nonlinear 
sink theorem for classical (i.e. not projected) dynamical systems (see Hirsch 
et a1 (1974)); we will assume a stronger condition on F ,  that is the jacobian 
matrix of F in x* is positive definite, instead of having its eigenvalues positive 
real parts, but we also obtain a stronger result, i.e. x* is a strictly monotone 
attractor and exponentially stable (see Pappalardo et a1 (2002)), instead of only 
exponentially stable. 
Theorem 3.8 Let x* be a stationary point of LPDS(F,K). If F is continu- 
ously differentiable on a neighborhood of x* and the jacobian matrix JF(x*) 
is positive definite, then x* is a strictly monotone attractor and exponentially 
stable for LPDS(F,K). 
A result similar to Theorem 3.8 can be proved also for GPDS(F,K,a), pro- 
vided that a is small enough (see Pappalardo et a1 (2002)). 
Theorem 3.9 Let x* be a stationary point of GPDS(F,K,a). If F is contin- 
uously differentiable on a neighborhood of x* and the jacobian matrix JFlx*) 
is positive definite, then there exists a0 > 0 such that x* is a strictly monotone 
attractor and exponentially stable for GPDS(F,K,a) for any a < ao.

SPECIAL CASES 
This section is devoted to the stability analysis in two special cases: when the 
domain K is a convex polyhedron and when the vector field F is linear. 
We remarked that the stability for a locally projected dynamical system is 
generally different from that of a standard dynamical system; however, when K 
is a convex polyhedron, many local stability properties for LPDS(F,K) follow on 
that of a classical dynamical system in lower dimension, under suitable assump- 
tion on the regularity of the stationary points of LPDS(F,K) (see Nagurney et 
a1 (1995)). 
We assume that K is specified by 
where B is an m x n matrix, with rows Bi, and b E Rn. We recall that a 
face of K is the intersection of K and a number of hyperplanes that support 
K ,  and the minimal face of K containing a point x, denoted by E(x), is the 
intersection of all the faces of K containing x. If we denote 
I ( x ) = { i :  Bix=bi) 
and 
S(X)={XE R n :  Bix=O, Qi'iI(x)}, 
then E(x) = (S(x) + x) n K. We assume that S(x) = Rn, when I(x) = 0. 
Let x* be a stationary point of LPDS(F,K), with dimS(x*) > 1, then there 
is a S > 0 such that 
The following ordinary differential equation defined on the subspace S(x*): 
is called the minimal face flow and it is denoted by MFF(F,K,x*). Note that if 
F is locally Lipschitz continuous, then so is the right hand side of MFF(F,K,x*), 
hence, for any zo E S(x*), there is a unique solution zo(t) to MFF(F,K,x*), 
defined in a neighborhood of 0, such that zo(0) = zo. Moreover, it is clear that 
0 E S(x*) is a stationary point of MFF(F,K,x*). The stability of 0 E S(x*) for 
MFF(F,K,x*) assures the stability of x* for LPDS(F,K), under some regular- 
ity condition on x*, which we now introduce. Since x* solves the variational 
inequality SVI(F,K), we have 

418 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
where NK(x*) = { y  E Rn : (y,x - x*) 5 0, V x E K )  is the normal cone of 
K at x*. We say that x* is a regular solution of SVI(F,K) if 
where riNK(x*) denotes the relative interior of NK(x*). Note that any interior 
solution of SVI(F,K) is regular if we assume ri{O) = (0); moreover, when x* is 
a solution of SVI(F,K) that lies on an (n-1)-dimensional face of K, it is regular 
if and only if F(x*) # 0. 
Now we show two stability results proved in Nagurney et a1 (1995). First, a 
regular solution to SVI(F,K) has the strongest stability when it is an extreme 
point of K. 
Theorem 4.1 If x* is a regular solution to SVI(F,K) and S(x*) = {0), then 
it is a finite-time attractor for LPDS(F,K) and there are y > 0 and 6 > 0 such 
that, for any solution x(t), with x(0) E B(x*, S) n K 
The stability results in the general case are summarized in the following 
theorem. 
Theorem 4.2 If x* is a regular solution to SVI(F,K) and dimS(x*) 2 1, then 
if 0 is stable for MFF(F,K,x*), then x* is stable for LPDS(F,K); 
if 0 is asymptotically stable for MFF(F,K,x*), then x* is asymptotically 
stable for LPDS(F, K); 
i f  0 is a finite-time attractor for MFF(F,K,x*), then x* is a finite-time 
attractor for LPDS(F,K). 
We remark that the local stability of a stationary point x* of LPDS(F,K) 
depends on the combination of the regularity of x* and the local stability of 
MFF(F,K,x*). In the extreme case S(x*) = (0) the stability for LPDS(F,K) is 
implied only by the regularity condition, in the other extreme case, S(x*) = Rn, 
MFF(F,K,x*) is just a translation of LPDS(F,K) from x* to the origin, hence 
they enjoy the same stability. 
We now proceed to consider the special case of F being a linear vector 
field, that is F(x) = Ax, where A is a real n-dimensional matrix. Under this

assumption, the existence and uniqueness property for the solutions to the 
Cauchy problems associated to LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a) holds for any 
closed convex domain K (see Dupuis et a1 (1993) and Xia et a1 (2000)). 
We first remark that when the matrix A is positive definite, the local stability 
properties obtained for LPDS(F,K), by Theorem 3.8, and for GPDS(F,K,a), 
by Theorem 3.9, become global properties, as shown by the following result. 
Proposition 4.1 Assume that F(x) = Ax and x* is a stationary point of 
LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a). If A is a positive semidefinite matrix, then x* 
is a global monotone attractor for LPDS(F,K). If A is positive definite, then 
x* is the unique stationary point for LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a); moreover 
there is a 0  > 0 such that x* is a strictly global monotone attractor and globally 
exponentially stable for LPDS(F,K) and for GPDS(F,K,a) for any a < a o .  
Proof: It easy to prove that F is strongly monotone on K with constant 
r] = min (Ax, x) > 0; 
Ilxll=l 
therefore the variational inequality SVI(F,K) has a unique solution x*, which 
is also a stationary point for LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a). By Theorem 3.4, 
x* is a strictly global monotone attractor and globally exponentially stable for 
LPDS(F,K). Moreover F is Lipschitz continuous on K with constant IIAll. By 
Theorem 3.5, x* is a strictly global monotone attractor and globally exponen- 
tially stable for GPDS(F,K,a), provided that a < 2r]/llA112. 
In addition, if we assume that the domain K is a closed convex cone, then 
it is well-known that SVI(F,K) is equivalent to a generalized complementarity 
problem. In this case the origin is a trivial stationary point for LPDS(F,K) and 
GPDS(F,K,a), and we can easily prove some stability properties for it, under 
the weaker assumption that the matrix A is (strictly) copositive with respect 
to the cone K. 
Proposition 4.2 Assume that K be a closed convex cone and F(x) = Ax. If 
A is a copositive matrix with respect to K, that is ( x ,  Ax) 2 0 for all x E K, 
then x* = 0 is a global monotone attractor for LPDS(F,K). If A is strictly 
copositive with respect to K, that is ( x ,  Ax) > 0 for all x E K, then x* = 0 
is the unique stationary point for LPDS(F,K) and GPDS(F,K,a), and there 
exists a 0  > 0 such that x* = 0 is a strictly global monotone attractor and

globally exponentially stable for LPDS(F,K) and for GPDS(F,K,a), for any 
a < a o .  
The stability analysis in the linear case is still open; future research might be 
carried on to study suitable conditions on the matrix A providing stability for 
any closed and convex domain. Also, it might be of interest to check if, when 
F is an affine vector field and K = R3, the classes of matrices needed for the 
study of existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the linear complementarity 
problem are sufficient to guarantee some stability properties.

Abstract: We present a theory of quasi-consistent approximations that com- 
bines the theory of consistent approximations with the theory of algorithm 
implementation, presented in Polak (1997), and enables us to solve infinite- 
dimensional optimization problems whose discretization involves two precision 
parameters. A typical example of such a problem is an optimal control prob- 
lem with initial and final value constraints. The theory includes new algorithm 
models that can be used with two discretization parameters. We illustrate the 
applicability of these algorithm models by implementing them using an approx- 
imate steepest descent method and applying it them to a simple two point 
boundary value optimal control problem. Our numerical results (not only the 
ones in this paper) show that these new algorithms perform quite well and are 
fairly insensitive to the selection of user-set parameters. Also, they appear to 
be superior to some alternative, ad hoc schemes. 
Key words: Optimization, partial differential equations, acceleration methods

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The research presented in this paper was motivated by optimal control problems 
with ODE or PDE dynamics, whose discretized dynamics cannot be solved 
explicitly. For example, consider a classical optimal control problem of the 
form 
where Lg,2[0,1] is a linear space whose elements are in Lg[O, 11, but it uses 
the Lz [O,1] norm, f (u) = F(xu (I)), and xu (t) E IRn is the solution of the two 
point boundary value problem 
with the usual assumptions (see, e.g., Polak (1997), Ch. 4). If we discretize 
the dynamics (1.2) by means of Euler's method, using a step-size 1/N, where 
N > 0 is an integer, we get 
and the discretized problem assumes the form 
where LN is the space of functions taking values in IRm, which are constant of 
the intervals [k/N, (k+l)/N), k = 0,1, ..., N- 1, fN(u) = F(x&), and x v s  the 
solution of (1.3). Generally, (1.3) cannot be solved explicitly, and hence must 
be solved by some recursive technique, that we will call a "solver". Since only 
a finite number of iterations of the solver can be contemplated, in solving the 
problem (1.1) numerically, we find ourselves dealing with two approximation 
parameters: N, which determines the Euler integration step-size, and, say K, 
the number of iterations of the solver used to approximate x& and hence also 
fN(u). If we denote by x&,, the result of K iterations of the solver in solving 
(1.3), we get a second level approximating problem 
where ~ N , K  
(u) = F(x&,,). 
Note that while the function fN(u) is continuously differentiable under stan- 
dard assumptions, depending on the solver, the function fN,,(u) may fail to 

PROBLEMS WITH TWO NUMERICAL PRECISION PARAMETERS 
425 
be even continuous. Hence we may not assume that (1.5) is solvable by means 
of standard nonlinear programming type algorithms. 
An examination of the literature shows that efficient approaches to solving 
infinite dimensional problems use "dynamic discretization," i. e., they start 
out with low discretization precision and increase the precision progressively 
as the computation proceeds. Referring to Polak (1997), we see that there are 
essentially two distinct approaches to "dynamic" discretization, both of which 
have been used only in situations with a single discretization parameter. 
The first and oldest is that of algorithm implementation, see, e.g., Becker et 
a1 (2000); Betts et a1 (1998); Carter (1991); Carter (1993); Deuflhard (1974); 
Deuflhard (1975); Deuflhard (1991); Dunn et a1 (1983); Kelley et a1 (1991); Kel- 
ley et a1 (1999); Polak et a1 (1976); Mayne et a1 (1977); Sachs (1986). In this 
approach, first one develops a conceptual algorithm for the original problem 
and then a numerical implementation of this algorithm. In each iteration, the 
numerical implementation adjusts the precision with which the function and 
derivative values used by the conceptual algorithm are approximated so as to 
ensure convergence to a stationary point of the original problem. When far 
from a solution the approximate algorithms perform well at low precision, but 
as a solution is approached, the demand for increased precision progressively 
increases. Potentially, this approach is extendable to the case where two dis- 
cretization parameters must be used. 
The second, and more recent approach to dynamic discretization uses se- 
quences of finite dimensional approximating problems, and is currently re- 
stricted to problems with a single discretization parameter. It was formalized 
in Polak (1993); Polak (1997), in the form of a theory of consistent approxi- 
mations. Applications to optimal control are described in Schwartz (1996a); 
Schwartz et a1 (1996), and a software package for optimal control, based on 
consistent approximations, can be obtained from Schwartz (199613). Within 
this approach, an infinite dimensional problem, P ,  such as an optimal control 
problem with either ODE or PDE dynamics, is replaced by an infinite sequence 
of "nested", epi-converging finite dimensional problems {PN). Problem P is 
then solved by a recursive scheme which applies a nonlinear programming al- 
gorithm to problem PN until a test is satisfied, at which point it proceeds to 
solve problem Pk+l, 
using the last point obtained for PN as the initial point 
for the new calculation. In Polak (1997) we find a number of Algorithm Models 

426 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
for organizing such a calculation. The advantages of the consistent approxima- 
tions approach over the algorithm implementation approach are that (i) there 
is a much richer set of possibilities for constructing precision refinement tests, 
and hence for devising one that enhances computational efficiency, and (ii) one 
can use unmodified nonlinear programming code libraries as subroutines, see 
Schwartz (1996a); Schwartz (199613). 
In this paper we develop two-tier algorithms for solving infinite dimensional 
optimization problems for which two discretization parameters must be used. 
In the first tier, this algorithm constructs an infinite sequence of epi-converging 
finite dimensional approximating problems {PN), such as (1.4), and in the 
second tier, it uses an algorithm implementation strategy in solving each PN. 
The main task that we had to address was that of constructing efficient tests 
for dynamically adjusting two precision parameters: N and K, where K de- 
termines the precision used in the implementation strategy. The end result 
can be viewed as a quasi consistent approximations approach. As we will see 
in Section 3, our new algorithm performs considerably better than an ad hoc 
algorithm implementation scheme on the problems tested. 
Finally, to make this paper reasonably self contained we include an appendix 
in which we define and summarize the properties of consistent approximations.

AN ALGORITHM MODEL 
We now proceed in an abstract setting1 Let S be a normed space, f : S -+ R a 
continuously differentiable function, and V c S .  We will consider the problem 
P 
min f (v) 
vEV 
(2.1) 
and we will assume that we have an optimality function 8 : S -+ R for P. 
Next, we will assume that {SN)F=No is a nested sequence of finite dimen- 
sional subspaces of S such that USN is dense in S, and that the pair (P, 8) can 
be approximated by an infinite sequence of consistent approximations (PN, ON), 
N = No, ....., where ON : SN --+ R is an optimality function for PN, with PN 
of the form 
PN 
min fiv(v), 
V ~ V N  
(2.2) 
where the functions f N  : SN -+ R are continuously differentiable, and VN c 
SN

Finally, we assume that the exact evaluation of the functions fN(.) and 
their gradients is not practical, and that an iterative "solver" must be used, 
with K iterations of the solver yielding an approximation f N , ~ ( u )  
to fN(u), 
and similarly, approximations VK ~ N ( u )  
to V f N  (u), and ON,K(U) to ON(U). We 
will make no continuity assumptions on ~N,K(.), 
VK fN (-), or 
In response of the above assumption, we will develop new algorithm models, 
with two precision parameters, for solving problems of the form P, by mim- 
icking the one precision parameter Algorithm Model 3.3.17 in Polak (1997). 
Algorithm Model 3.3.17 in Polak (1997) assumes that the functions fN(.), in 
(2.2) and the associated optimality functions ON, are computable, and that for 
any bounded set B C V, there exists a function A : N - IR+ and a 6 E (0, oo), 
such that for all v E VN n B, 
with A(N) - 0 as N + oo. 
Algorithm Model 3.3.17 in Polak (1997) uses a parametrized iteration func- 
tionAN : VN + VN, N E {N-l,No,Nl ,...) C N := {0,1,2,3 ,...). When 
AN(w) is derived from the Armijo gradient method, it will have the form 
where X(v) > 0 is the Armijo step-size. For convenience, we reproduce Algo- 
rithm Model 3.3.17 in Polak (1997) below.

Step 2. Replace i by i + 1, and go to Step 1. 
Algorithm Model l a  has the following convergence property: 
Theorem 2.1 Suppose that 
(i) for every bounded set B c V, there exists 6 < ca and a function A :

A(N) = 0, and for all N E N, N > N-1,

such that 
Then, every accumulation point ij of a sequence { v ~ ) ~ ~ ,  
constructed by Algo- 
rithm Model la, satisfies 0(+) = 0. 
0 
Referring to Section 1.2 in Polak (1997), we note that Algorithm Model l a  
can also be used in an algorithm implementation scheme. Thus, suppose N is 
fixed and that K iterations of the solver applied to function and gradient eval- 
uations yield the approximations f N , ~ ( v )  
and AN,~(v), 
to fN(v) and AN (v) 
respectively, and that for any bounded subset B c VN, there is a 6 E (0, m) 
and a function cp : N x N + IR+, such that cp(N, K )  + 0 as K + ca and 
Making use of these definitions, we can now state the following scheme, based 
on the idea of algorithm implementation, for solving the problem PN.

Step 2. Replace i by i + 1, and go to Step 1.

Referring to Theorem 1.2.37 in Polak (1997), we see that Algorithm Model 
l b  has the following convergence property: 
Theorem 2.2 Suppose that 
(i) for every bounded set B c VN, there exists K < cm and a function cp : 
N x N + Re+ such that lim~,, 
p(N, K )  = 0, and for all K E N, 
K > K - 1 ,  VE VNnB, 
(ii) For every v* E VN such that QN(v*) # 0, there exist p* > 0, 6* > 0, 
K* < cm, such that 
~N,K(AN,K(~)) 
- ~ N , K ( v )  L -6*, Vv E VN n B(v*,p*), VK 2 K*. 
(2.13) 
Then, every accumulation point .ir of a sequence {vi)r, constructed by Algo- 
rithm Model l b, satisfies ON (G) = 0. 
0 
In view of this, we propose to construct an algorithm model which behaves 
as follows. Given a discretization parameter N, it applies Algorithm Model l b  
to PN until a sufficiently good approximation to its solution is obtained, and 
then it increases N and repeats the process. We will use the failure of a test 
of the form (2.6) to determine that that one is close enough to a solution of 
PN. As a result, the problems PN will be solved more and more accurately as 
the computation progresses. Parameters in the algorithm will allow the user to 

430 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
balance the precision with which the problems PN are solved versus the speed 
with which N is advanced. 
At this point we must introduce some realistic assumptions. In particular, 
we assume that for every N, K E N, we can construct an iteration map AN,K : 
VN + VN, where K is the number of iterations of a solver. 
Assumption: We will assume as follows: 
(i) The function f (.) is continuous and bounded from below, and for all N E N, 
the functions f ~ ( . )  
are continuous and bounded from below. 
(ii) For every bounded set B c V, there exists 6 < cm, a function K* : N -+ N,

Remark 2.1 
1. The main function of the test (2.21) is to increase N over the initial value 
of N = N*(Ni) if that is necessary. It gets reset to N = N*(Ni) whenever Ni 
is halved. 
2. Note that the faster cp(N, K )  + 0 as K -+ oo, the easier it is to satisfy the 
test (2.21) at a particular value of N. Thus, when the solver is fast, the precision 
parameter Ki will be increased more slowly than when it is slow. A similar 
argument applies to the increase of Ni, on the basis of the test in (2.23). In the 
context of dynamics defined by differential equations, the integration mesh size, 

432 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1/Ni, will be refined much faster when the Euler method is used for integration 
than when a Runge-Kutta method is used for integration.

Lemma 2.1 Suppose that Assumption is satisfied. 
(a) If vi E VN is such that 9(vi) # 0, then there exists an Ni < oo such that 
(2.23) fails, i.e., vi+l is constructed. 
(b) If Algorithm Model 2 constructs an infinite sequence {vi)zo that has 
at least one accumulation point, then Ni t m ,  as i + oo, and hence, also, 
K i t o o , a s i t o o .  
Proof. (a) Suppose that vi E V, is such that 9(vi) # 0. Then, by Assumption 
(iii), there exist an N < oo, K < m, and 8 < 0, such that for all N 2 N, 
K 2 K, 
fiV,K(AiV,K(wi) - fN,K(vi) 5 -8 5 -A(N, K ) ~ .  
(2.25) 
Since by construction Ki 2 K*(Ni) and K*(N) -+ oo, as N + oo, it follows 
that there exists an Ni < oo such that (2.23) fails. 
(b) For the sake of contradiction, suppose that the monotone increasing 
sequence {Ni)go is bounded from above by b < oo. Then there exists an 
io such that Ni = Ni, = N* < oo for all i 2 io. In this case, there is a 
K *  5 Ic * K*(N*) + K and an il 2 io such that Ki = K *  for all i 2 il. Hence, 
for all i > il, since (2.23) fails for each such i, 
which shows that f ~ * , ~ * ( v i )  
t -00, as i + oo. Now, it follows from (2.18) 
and (2.19) that for all i 2 il, 
which implies that f (vi) + -oo, as i + m .  However, by assumption, there 
exists an infinite subsequence {vij) and a v* E Vh*, such that vij t v*, as j t 
oo. Since f (.) is continuous, by assumption, we conclude that f (vij) + f (v*), 
as j + oo, which is a contradiction, and completes our proof.

Theorem 2.3 Suppose that Assumption is satisfied. 
(a) If {vi)z0 is a sequence constructed by Algorithm Model 2, in solving the 
problem P, then every accumulation point v* of {vi)zo satisfies 9(v*) = 0. 

PROBLEMS WITH TWO NUMERICAL PRECISION PARAMETERS 
433 
(b) If f(.) is strictly convex, with bounded level sets, and {vi)zo is a 
sequence constructed by Algorithm Model 2, in solving the problem P, then 
{vi)z0 converges to the unique solution of P. 
Proof. (a) Suppose that {vi)z0 is a sequence constructed by Algorithm Model 
2 and that {vij)Zo is a subsequence converging to a point 6 and that 8(6) # 0. 
Now, by Lemma 2.1, Ni --t 0, as i --t oo, and by Assumption (iii), since 
Ki 2 K*(Ni), there exist @ > 0, $ > 0, > 0, such that 
f~;,K~(ANi,~i(vi)) 
- fN;,~i(vi) < -8, 
Vvi E B(6, @), VNi 2 N. 
Next we note that in view of (2.18) and (2.19), for any v E V,, 
If (u) - ~ N ~ , K ~ ( U ) ~  
I f i ~ ( ~ i , ~ i )

Let io be such that for all ij 2 io, vij E B(6, @) and 
2nA(Nij, Kij) 5 ;$, 
Finally, let il L io be such that Ni I for all i 2 il. Then, for the subsequence 
{vij)Zo, with ij 2 il, 
< -8 + 2nB(Nij, Kij) 5 -;8, 
(2.32) 
and in addition, in view of (2.29) and the test (2.23), for all i 
21, 
Hence we see that the sequence { f (vi))zi, is monotone decreasing, and there- 
fore, because f (.) is continuous, it must converge to f (6). Since this is contra- 
dicted by (2.31), our proof is complete. 
(b) Since a strictly convex function, with bounded level sets, has exactly 
one stationary point, the desired result follows from (a) and the fact that 
{ f (vi))zil is monotone decreasing.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Remark 2.2 The following Algorithm Model differs from Algorithm Model 2 
in two respects: first the integer K is never reset and hence increases monoton- 
ically, and second the test for increasing N is based on the magnitude of the 
approximate optimality function value. As a result, the proof of its convergence 
is substantially simpler than that for Algorithm Model 2. However, convergence 
can be established only for the diagonal subsequence {vij)zo at which Ni is 
doubled.

At this point we need an additional assumption: 
Assumption: We will assume as follows: 
(i) The optimality functions O(.) and ON(.) are continuous for all N E N. 
(ii) For every bounded set B C V, there exists n < oo, a function K* : N -+ N, 
and functions cp : N x N -+ R+, A : N -+ R+ satisfying (2.15)-(2.17), 
such that for all N E N, v E VN n B, 
and for all N E N ,  K E N ,  v E VNnB, 
where ON,K(U) is the approximation to ON(V) obtained as a result of K 
iterations of a solver. 
Theorem 2.4 Suppose that Assumptions and are satisfied and that {v;) is 
a sequence constructed by Algorithm Model 3, in solving the problem P. 
(a) If {v;) is finite, then the sequence {vi}zo has no accumulation points. 
(b) If {vj*) is infinite, then every accumulation point v* of {~j*)joo,~ satisfies 
qv*) = o. 
(c) If f (.) is strictly convex, with bounded level sets, and {~j*)joo,~ is a 
bounded sequence constructed by Algorithm Model 3, in solving the problem 
P ,  then it converges to the unique solution of P. 
Proof. (a) Suppose that the sequence {v;) is finite and that he sequence 
{vi}zo has an accumulation point v*. Then there exists an io, an N* < oo, 
and an E* > 0, such that for all i 2 io, Ni = N*, E i  = E*, and ON*,Ki (vi) < -E*. 
But, in this case, for i 2 io, the Inner Loop of Algorithm Model 2 is recognized 
as being of the form of Master Algorithm Model 1.2.36, in Polak (1997). It now 
follows from Theorem 1.2.37 in Polak (1997) that Ki -+ oo, as i -t oo, and that 
 ON*(^*) = 0. Next, it follows from (2.38), in Assumption and the continuity of 
ON*('), that for some infinite subsequence {Vij), 
ON*,Kij (Vij) -+ ON*(v*) = 0, 
which shows that (2.36) could not be violated an infinite number of times, a 
contradiction. 
(b) When the sequence {vf ) is infinite, it follows directly from Assumption 
2 and the test (2.36) that if v* is an accumulation point of {vj*), then O(v*) = 0.

(c) When the function f (.) is strictly convex, with bounded level sets, it has 
a unique minimizer v* which is the only point in V satisfying 13(v*) = 0. Hence 
the desired result follows from (b).

A DISTRIBUTED PROBLEM WITH CONTROL IN THE 
COEFFICIENTS 
An absorbant coating of thickness a on a multi-component airfoil S is to be 
optimized to cancel the reflected wave u from an accoustic incident wave u, 
of frequency w, in a sector angle C. 
The Leontovich condition models the thin coating and the thickness of the 
coating layer is proportional to the Leontovich coefficient a. A first order 
absorbing boundary condition is applied on the outer boundary I?, 
which, for 
computational purposes is assumed to be at finite distance; therefore the sector 
angle is a portion of r,. 
The problem is

In weak form the PDE is 
It can be shown that it has one and only one solution which depends con- 
tinuously upon the data a. Note that u is a nonlinear function of a. 
The problem is discretized by the finite element method of degree one Ciarlet 
(1977) on triangles combined with a domain decomposition strategy with the 
purpose of having a finer mesh in desired regions without having to touch the 
rest of the domain. All linear systems are solved with the Gauss factorization 
method. 
The airfoil is made of two parts, a main airfoil Sm and an auxiliary airfoil S,, 
below and slightly behind the main one. To apply Domain Decomposition we 
need to partition the physical domain R as a union R1 UR2 of two sub-domains 
with a non empty intersection. This is done by surrounding the auxiliary airfoil 
by a domain R2 outside Sm and with boundary dR2 = r2 U S, and by taking

R1 = R\D 
where D contains S, but is contained in R2. Note that I', 
US, 
Url 
is the boundary of Rl if rl denotes dD. 
Each domain is triangulated by an automatic mesh generator which is mon- 
itored by the mesh of the boundaries. So as the mesh sizes on the boundary 
tend to zero, so does the size of the triangles. 
We denote by Vi, i = 1,2 the spaces of piecewise linear functions on the 
triangulations of Ri which are zero on the approximations of r2 and C respec- 
tively. 
Consider the two problems: given zi, j = 1,2, piecewise linear continuous 
on the triangulation of Rj, find ujh such that ujh - z i  E V/ and

The Schwarz algorithm is as follows: 
1. Choose zi, zz, E > 0

Solve (3.3) and (3.4) 
where IIh is the interpolation operator from one mesh to the other. The aprox-

However, for compatibility with the theory in this paper, we determine the 
mesh size h = 1/N and the number of Schwarz iterations K as required in 
Algorithm Model 2, and we do not use a z1 - z2 to determine the number of 
Schwarz iterations. 
The convergence of the Schwarz algorithm is known only for compatible 
meshes, i.e. meshes of R1 and R2 identical in R1 f l  R2.

where U ~ , K  and p h , ~  
are computed by K iterations of the Schwarz algorithm. 
Details of the validity of this calculus of variations calculation can be found 
in Lions (1958) 
3.2 Verification ofHypotheses 
(i) Continuity of f (.) with respect to the control is established in Cessenat 
(1998). Continuity of fh(.) with respect to the control is obvious from the 
matrix representation of the problem and the fact that the matrices are non 
singular. 
(ii) It follows from the finite element error estimates given in Ciarlet (1977) 
that for some C < oo, 
lluh - ullo < Ch2, 
(3.14) 
which implies that 
lfh(vh) - f (v)( < ch2. 
Hence we can set A(h) = h2. 
(iii) The Schwarz algorithm converges linearly with rate constant (1 - d/D), 
where d is the diameter of O1 nil2 and D is the diameter of Cll U 0 2 ,  SO instead 
of (3.14) we have the bound 
for some C E (0, oo), which implies that we can set cp(h, K )  = (1 - g)K. Note 
that in this case cp(h, K )  is actually independent of h. In view of this, we can 
take K*(h) = Cceil(l/h), where C > 0 is arbitrary. 
(iv) It follows from the properties of the method of steepest descent that, 
given any v* iK V = L2(0, 1) such that V f  (v*) # 0, there exist a p* > 0, a 
6* > 0, A*, and an h* > 0, suchthat for all v E V n B ( v * , p ) ,  (i) V f h ( v )  # 0 
and (ii) 
f (v - A(v)V f (v)) - f (v) < f (v - A*Vf (v)) - f (v) 5 -d*,

where A(v) is the exact step-size computed by the Steepest Descent Algorithm.

3.3 Numerical Results 
The following test was conducted in cooperation with G. Lemarchand. Other 
test cases can be found in Pironnea et a1 (2002). Compared with these, the 
novelty of this accoustic problem is that it is nonlinear. 
The numerical software freefem+Bernardi et at (1999) was used to solve 
the problem where the obstacles are two NACA0012 airfoils of length 1 in 
a circular domain of radius 5. The accoustic wave comes horizontally with 
frequency w = 1.7. The optimization starts with a = 0. The Schwarz iteration 
number K is augmented by 1 when the test fails until the criteria is met and 
the mesh size goes from c/n to c/(n + 1) when refinement is required by the 
algorithm. 
Figure 3.1 and figure 3.2 show the solution and figure 3.3 shows the history 
of the convergence compared with a straight steepest descent method and a 
steepest descent with mesh refinement only and no DDM. 
On this example Algorithm model 3 proved ro be fairly stable. Note that the 
approximation of the objective function increases quite a lot whenever the mesh 
is subdivided, at least in the beginning, but that it a common phenomenon. 
The speed-up over using fixed very small h and very large K is considerable 
because most of the optimization occurs before the mesh is too fine or the 
number of Schwarz iterations is too large.

Abstract: 
We develop a numerical solution strategy for a general class of 
optimal switching control problems. We view this class of problems as a nat- 
ural extension of related classes considered previously, namely discrete valued 
optimal control problems and time optimal control problems. We show that 
techniques developed for these subclasses may be readily extended to the more 
general class considered in this paper. Numerical results are given to illus- 
trate the proposed approach and to compare it with another recently developed 
solution technique. 
Key words: 
Optimal control, computational methods, switching dynamics, 
control parametrization, transformations.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we consider a class of optimal switching control problems. These 
are characterized by the fact that the state variables of the problem are gen- 
erated from a given initial state in conjunction with a successive sequence of 
dynamical systems which the user can select from amongst a given finite set. 
It is assumed that each system in this sequence is active for a certain duration 
within the time horizon and that the state of the system is continuous across 
a time point where systems are switched, i.e. the final state over the previous 
time duration is chosen as the initial state for the next time duration. The aim 
in these problems is to choose a sequence of dynamical systems such that the 
resulting state of the system optimizes a given performance index. At the same 
time, the aim is to also optimally choose the time durations over which each 
of the chosen dynamical systems is active. In this work, we limit our atten- 
tion to problems involving dynamical systems describes by systems of ordinary 
differential equations (ODES). 
This class of problems has significant practical applications in economics, 
management, production planning and industrial engineering, as dynamical 
systems arising in these areas are typically subject to frequent and sudden 
changes. 
A number of subclasses of the general switching control problem exist. These 
include time optimal control problems (where the optimal control is of bang- 
bang type) and discrete valued optimal control problems (where the control is 
only allowed to take values from a finite, discrete set). The common feature 
of all these problems is the need to accurately determine the optimal times 
for the control function to switch (between its upper and lower bounds in 
the case of time optimal control and between discrete values for the discrete 
valued optimal control). Regarding these switching times as parameters, it is 
known that the objective function gradients with respect to these parameters is 
discontinuous (see Teo et al. (1991)). Hence, direct solution via gradient based 
optimization methods does not usually work well for these problems. Recently, 
the Control Parametrization Enhancing Technique (CPET) has been proposed 
to overcome this difficulty. The basic idea is to introduce an auxiliary control 
function (known as the enhancing control) which is used to scale the original 
time horizon in such a way that the switching times are mapped to fixed points 
in the transformed time scale. CPET was originally introduced for time optimal 

OPTIMAL SWITCHING CONTROL PROBLEMS 
449 
control problems in Lee et al. (1997). The application of CPET to discrete 
valued optimal control problems is demonstrated in Lee et al. (1999); Lee et 
al. (2001); Lee et al. (2001a). An additional difficulty arises with discrete 
valued optimal control problems in that one needs to find not only the optimal 
switching times but also the corresponding optimal sequence of control values. 
Assuming a finite number of switching times, a heuristic method is proposed in 
Lee et al. (1999) to deal with this difficulty. Similar issues need to be addressed 
for the class of problems considered in this paper. A review of the CPET can 
be found in Rehbock et al. (1999). 
Further, note that another efficient numerical approach for time optimal 
control and discrete valued optimal control problems has recently been proposed 
in Kaya and Noakes (2001a) and Kaya and Noakes (2001b). This is based on a 
combination of the Switching Time Computation (STC) method and the Time 
- Optimal Switchings (TOS) algorithms. 
General optimal switching control problems have received limited attention 
in the literature. Theoretical and some computational aspects of these prob- 
lems can be found in Yong (1989) and Li and Yong (1995) and in the references 
cited therein. A computational approach for solving optimal switching control 
problems with a fixed number of switching times has recently been proposed in 
Liu and Teo (2000). The approach in Liu and Teo (2000) involves a two trans- 
formations which turn the original problem into a form suitable for solution 
by a standard optimal control software. The first transformation introduces 
a set of scalar variables and associated constraints which determine whether 
a particular choice of dynamical system is active over a given time interval. 
This is similar to an approach proposed in Wang et al. (1996) to deal with 
general mixed programming problem. The resulting constraints are appended 
to the cost functional as penalty functions. The second transformation involves 
a rescaling of the original time horizon, along the lines of the CPET, to deal 
with the variable switching times. 
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a general class of optimal 
switching control problems can be transformed into a form suitable for solution 
by standard optimal control software (such as MISER3, see Jennings et al. 
(1991), Jennings et al. (2001)) through a more direct application of CPET. 
The resulting algorithm differs somewhat to that of Liu and Teo (2000) in that 
we do not assume a fixed number of switching times. As demonstrated by the 

450 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
numerical results, this can sometimes lead to more optimal objective function 
values. 
Note, though, that neither of these algorithms can guarantee a globally op- 
timal solution, due to the combinatorial aspect of having to choose an optimal 
sequence of dynamical systems.

defined on the time horizon [O,T]. Each of these may be invoked over any 
subinterval of the time horizon. For i = 1,2,. . . , M, let the i-th candidate 
system be defined by a set of first order ordinary differential equations, i.e. 
where x = [xl, x2, . . . , xnIT E Rn is the state of the system and 
f Z  = [f;, f;, . . . , f:lT 
E Rn is continuously differentiable in all its arguments. 
We denote these systems collectively by the set 
Let K > 1 be an integer. Then, we define 
Here, each TK = [tl, t2, . . . , tK-1IT E TK is called a feasible switching time 
sequence of length K ,  and each VK = [vl, v2,. . . , vKjT E VK is called an index 
sequence of length K. Note how the index sequence VK = [vl, v2,. . . , vKIT can 
be readily used to define a sequence of dynamical systems {R,, , Rv, , . . . , QvK}. 
We refer to '& x VK as the set of feasible switching sequences of length K .  
Corresponding to each K and each feasible switching sequence ( r K ,  vK) E 
IK 
x VK, we can define a dynamical system over the entire time horizon as 
follows. Let to = 0 and t~ = T, then consider 

OPTIMAL SWITCHING CONTROL PROBLEMS 
451 
where xo E Rn is a given initial condition of the system and where we use 
the notation x(t - 0) = lim x(t + E). 
Note how equation (2.6) insures the 
€--to- 
continuity of the resulting state of the system. Finally, let the solution to 
the system (2.4)-(2.6) corresponding to (TK,VK) E ?i( x VK be denoted as 
~ ( ~ I T K ,  
OK). 
For each K and each (TK,VK) E TK x VK, we define the following cost 
functional: 
J(K, TK, VK) = @(x(T)) + 
g(t, ~ ( ~ I T K ,  VK)) dt. 
JdT 
(2.7) 
The optimal switching control problem is then defined as:Problem (P): 
Find a K and (TK, vK) E 'TK x VK to minimize the cost functional (2.7) 
subject to the dynamics (2.4)-(2.6). 
Note how this general model encompasses the classes of time-optimal and 
discrete valued control problems addressed in the earlier references. For in- 
stance, in a discrete valued optimal control problem, we can consider each 
possible combination of the discrete control values as leading to a different dy- 
namical system Ri which is obtained by simply substituting the control values. 
In problems where the control has multiple components with each one capable 
of taking on a large number of discrete values, this can lead to a large set R 
and we come back to this issue later. 
We could include a range of other parameters, control functions and canon- 
ical constraints in Problem (P), but choose not to do so here for the sake of 
brevity. If ordinary (i. e. non-discrete valued) control functions were incorpo- 
rated, issues regarding the partitioning of [0, T] with respect to the parametriza- 
tion of the controls would need to be addressed carefully to avoid discrepancies 
with the switching times. 
Finally, note that the basic class of problems considered here is slightly 
different to that addressed in (Liu and Teo (2000)), because we allow K to be 
variable. Also, we do not consider terms directly measuring a cost of switching 
in the cost functional, although it is not clear whether the technique developed 
in Liu and Teo (2000) can actually deal with these in all cases. 
Before proceeding, we make one assumption about the nature of Problem 
(PI: 
Assumption 1: There exists an optimal solution of Problem (P) where K 
is finite.

SOLUTION STRATEGY 
The aim of this section is to describe a transformation which turns Problem 
(P) into a standard form suitable for solution by the ordinary control para- 
metrization approach. As for the subclass of discrete valued optimal control 
problems dealt with in Lee et al. (1999), we use the control parametrization 
enhancing technique (CPET) in the second stage of this transformation. 
In view of Assumption 1, let us initially suppose that the optimal number 
of switchings is at most N. In order to allow for all possible combinations of 
systems in fl to occur, we let L = M ( N  + 1) and consider the fixed index 
sequence WL = [wl,w2, . . . , w L ] ~  
E VL where wj = ((j - 1) mod M) + 1, 
j = l ,  ..., L, ie. 
ie. the ordered sequence [l, 2,. . . , MI is repeated N +  1 times within WL. Then, 
we consider the following system on [0, TI. 
x(t) = fWj(t,x(t)), 
t ~ [ r j - l , r j ) ,  l , . . . ,  
L 
(3.1) 
~ ( 0 )  = 2 0 ,  
(3.2) 
x(rj) = x(q-O), 
j = l ,  ..., L-1, 
(3.3) 
where TL = [r1,r2,. . . , r ~ - ~ ] ~  
E 'TL must, of course, satisfy 
N 
We define the following prob1em:Problem (P ): Given N, for L = M(N+l), 
find a TL E 'TL (ie. its components must satisfy (3.4)) such that the cost 
functional J(L, TL, WL) defined by (2.7) is minimized subject to the dynamics 
(3.1)-(3.3). 
Note how the only variables in Problem (pN) are the components of TL, 
since both L and the index sequence WL are assumed fixed. It should also be 
clear that Problem (pN) may allow solutions with more then N switchings. In 
fact, it may allow solutions with up to L-1 switchings. In view of the algorithm 
described below, this is does not pose a problem, though. What is important 
to note is that all feasible switching sequences of length N for Problem (P) 
can be replicated as feasible switching sequences for Problem (PN), simply by 
choosing an appropriate TL E 'TL. 

OPTIMAL SWITCHING CONTROL PROBLEMS 
453 
Note that a solution of Problem (pN) may only be optimal with respect 
to allowing up to N switchings. Even if an optimal solution of Problem (P) 
has less than N switchings (in which case it is guaranteed to be amongst the 
feasible switching sequences of Problem (pN)) we have no sure way of find- 
ing such a globally optimal solution. Instead, our proposed algorithm is only 
guaranteed to find a locally optimal solution. Indeed, if the number of candi- 
date system, M, is large, such as is often the case in discrete valued optimal 
control problems, it is highly likely that only a locally optimal solution will be 
generated. The task of actually finding an optimal number of switchings and a 
corresponding optimal index sequence is theoretically challenging and has not 
been solved for the general class of problems under consideration here. How- 
ever, in many practical applications, careful examination of the problem, based 
on the minimum principle, can give clues to the optimal switching sequence 
and thus simplify this task. See Pudney et al. (1992) and Howlett (1996) for 
an example involving the optimal control of a train. 
We can, however, suggest a reasonable heuristic approach to approximate 
the globally optimal number of switchings as follows. Starting with a fixed 
N, we solve the Problem (PN). We then increase N (e.g. N = N + 1) and 
solve Problem (pN) 
again. If there is no decrease in the optimal cost, we 
assume that the optimal solution resulting from to the previous value of N 
contains the optimal number of switchings. Otherwise, we increase N further 
(by Assumption 1, we will only have to increase N a finite number of times). 
Note that, while this approach yields satisfactory results in many practical 
problems, it can not guarantee that the resulting N is indeed optimal. 
For a given TL E TL, the right hand side of (3.1) may be a discontinuous 
function oft at the switching points rj, j = 1,2, ..., L- 1. Hence, we encounter a 
number of difficulties when trying to calculate the optimal TL in a conventional 
manner: 
(a) We need to perform piecewise integration over intervals whose endpoints 
are variable; 
(b) The gradient of the cost functional with respect to TL is not continuous(see 
Teo et al. (1991)); 
(c) When ri-1 and ri coalesce, the number of decision variables changes. 

454 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
All of these difficulties are overcome by the CPET originally developed in 
Lee et al. (1997) for time optimal control problems and also employed for 
discrete valued optimal control problems in Lee et al. (1999). 
As in the cited references, we introduce the new time variable s E [0, L]. 
Let U denote the class of non-negative piecewise constant scalar functions de- 
fined on [0, L )  with fixed switching points located at {1,2,3, ..., L - 1). The 
transformation (CPET) from t E [0, T] to s E [0, L] is defined by 
where the scalar function u E U, u ( s )  = r j  - rj-1 for s E Ij - 1, j ) ,  is called the 
enhancing control. Clearly, it must satisfy 
Alternatively, we could replace (3.6) by the constraint 
Remark 3.1 As noted earlier, we are introducing many artificial switchings 
into the transformed problem by the above technique. This is necessary to allow 
all the possible orderings of the sequence of discrete control values to be consid- 
ered when solving the transformed problem. These artificial switchings do not 
cause any dificulties, though, since, if U ( S )  = 0 on [ j  - 1, j), then rj-1 = T j .  
Consequently, the choice of dynamical system RWj, valid for s E [ j  - 1, j), has 
no bearing on the the solution of the original problem. 
To complete the application of the CPET to the Problem (pN), 
note that, 
in the new time scale, the system dynamics may be conveniently rewritten as 
where we define Z(s) = x(t(s)), f' (s, Z(s)) = f j (t(s), x ( t ( s ) ) )  and t ( s )  is the 
solution of (3.5). Furthermore, the objective functional is transformed to 
J(u) = @(Z(L)) + 
u(s) g(s, Z ( s ) )  ds, 
JdL 

OPTIMAL SWITCHING CONTROL PROBLEMS 
455 
N 
where g(s, Z ( s ) )  = g(t(s), x(t(s))). Finally, we define Problem (P, ): Given 
N, find a u E U such that the cost functional (3.11) is minimized subject to 
the dynamics (3.5), (3.8)-(3.10) and subject to the constraint (3.7). 
Note that Problems (PN) and (P:) 
are equivalent. In Problem (P:), 
rather 
than finding T~,TZ, 
..., TL-1, we look for u E U. 
All switching points of the orig- 
inal problem are mapped onto the set of integers in chronological order. Piece- 
wise integration can now be performed easily since all points of discontinuity 
of the dynamics in the s-domain are known and fixed. Moreover, u E U is a 
piecewise constant function and hence Problem (P:) 
is readily solvable by the 
optimal control software MISER3 (see Jennings et al. (1991), Jennings et al. 
(2001)), which is an implementation of the control parametrization technique 
(see Teo et al. (1991)). Note that the piecewise integration of (3.8) is performed 
automatically in MISER3. The continuity constraints (3.10) are also satisfied 
automatically when executing the code in standard mode. 
The solution of (3.5) yields t ( s ) ,  so the the state trajectory x(t), of the 
original problem defined on [0, T] can be reconstructed easily. It is clear from 
Assumption 1 that there exists an integer N such that an optimal solution to 
Problem (P:) 
is also an optimal solution of the original Problein (P). We 
must note, though, that MISER3 uses a gradient based optimization approach 
and we are therefore not guaranteed of finding a globally optimal solution to 
Problem (P:) 
and therefore Problem (P). 
Remark 3.2 A large number, M ,  of candidate dynamical systems will result 
in a large number of control parameters once Problem (P:) 
is parametrized. 
This is particularly true in discrete valued control problems where the control has 
multiple components each capable of taking on a large number of discrete values 
and it reflects the combinatorial nature of the class of problems we consider here. 
A similarly large number of parameters arises in the technique proposed in Liu 
and Teo (2000). 
Remark 3.3 Note that an optimal solution of Problem (P:) 
found by MISERS 
does not necessarily represent a unique parametrization of the corresponding op- 
timal solution of Problem (PN), although this is of no practical consequence. 
The particular parametrization found depends on the initial guess supplied to 
MISERS.

NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION 
We consider the numerical example given in Liu and Teo (2000). In this prob- 
lem, there are 3 candidate dynamical systems and the time horizon is [O, 21. We 
have 
The given initial condition is x(0) = 0. The cost functional is 
We have M = 3 in this case. Following the approach in the previous section, 
we have L = 3(N + 1) and 
The transformed problem may then be written asMinimize the cost functional 
subject to the dynamics 
We solve the problem for various values of N. For N = 1, we get different 
solutions depending on the initial guess we provide for u. The results are 
summarized in Table 4.1. Note that we do not express these results in terms of 
u but in terms of the original statement of the problem for the sake of clarity. 
We note from Table 4.1 that the proposed method will generate local solutions 
depending on the choice of initial guess. For the first initial guess listed in Table 
4.1, we obtain a locally optimal solution which involves one switching and is 
identical to that produced in Liu and Teo (2000) (where at most one switching

was allowed). However, as the second line in the table shows, a different initial 
guess produces quite a different solution with 3 switches and a significantly 
lower cost. Virtually all other initial guesses we tried resulted in one of these 
two solutions. 
Next we tried increasing N to N = 3 in order to see if there are more 
optimal solutions if we allow more switchings. Again, many initial guesses 
were tested, with most of these leading to a solution with optimal switching 
sequence {RI , Q3, f l 1 , 0 2 ,  R1 , i22) and corresponding switching times 0.50156, 
0.82533, 0.91906, 0.97595, and 1.03862. The optimal cost value was 0.003170. 
Again, we did obtain a slightly worse local optimal solution with one of the 
initial guesses tested. 
A further increase to N = 7 did not yield any other solutions with a lower 
cost value, so the one obtained with N = 3 appears to be optimal, ie. our 
estimate for the optimal number of switches is 5.

CONCLUSIONS 
We have presented a new approach to solve a large class of optimal switching 
control problems. It is a natural extension of the approaches used for certain 
subclasses of these problems in some of our earlier work. Furthermore, it is 
more transparent than a recent alternative approach and it does not require 
the introduction of a set of equality constraints handled via penalty methods. 
On the other hand, the new approach is not always able to solve a problem 
when a fixed number of switching points is prescribed.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with state feedback controller design us-

mal feedback control law can be synthesized by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi 
equation with three layered neural networks. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation 
generates the value function by which the optimal feedback law is synthesized. 
To obtain an approximate solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we solve 
an optimization problem by the gradient method, which determines connection 
weights and thresholds in the neural networks. Gradient functions are calcu- 
lated explicitly by the Lagrange multiplier method and used in the learning 
algorithm of the networks. We propose also a device such that an approximate 
solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation converges to the true value function. 
The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed with simulations for

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is concerned with optimal state feedback control of nonlinear sys- 
tems. To solve nonlinear optimal regulator problem, we solve the Hamilton- 
Jacobi equation using neural networks and then synthesize the optimal state 
feedback control law with its approximate solution. 
Most studies on optimal control of nonlinear systems have been made by appli- 
cation of calculus of variation. They are aimed at calculating optimal control in- 
put uO(t), t € [0, tl] and the corresponding optimal trajectory xo(t), t E [0, tl] 
starting from an initial condition x(0). This yields the so called open-loop 
control, but a practically interesting matter is to obtain optimal state feedback 
control law uO(t) = a(x(t)), t E [0, tl] which brings us a closed loop system. 
As is well known, optimal regulator is a typical control problem in which a 
linear system and a quadratic performance functional are considered and the 
Riccati equation plays an important role. The reason of attaching importance 
to the optimal regulator is that it offers a systematic method to design a state 
feedback control law and consequently one can construct a closed-loop control 
system. 
In contrast it is very hard for nonlinear systems to design such an optimal 
state feedback controller. To synthesize the optimal state feedback control law 
resulting in the stable closed loop system, one must solve the Hamilton-Jacobi 
partial differential equation (H-J equation). 
However, nonlinear optimal regulator is of restrictive use since it is extremely 
difficult to solve H-J equation analytically. Hence we need to develop approxi- 
mate solution of the H-J equation. 
In the past several approaches to solve H-J equation were proposed as follows. 
(1) application of Taylor series expansion [Lukes (1969)l 
(2) application of neural networks [Goh (1993)l 
(3) application of Galerkin method [Beard (1997)l 
(4) application of Spline function [Lee (1996)l 
With the Taylor series expansion, one can obtain an accurate approximate 
solution around an operating point. However, it is difficult to approximate 
uniformly in broad range. 
The principle of neural network approximation for H-J equation is all explained 

NONLINEAR OPTIMAL REGULATOR 
463 
in [Goh (1993)l. However, gradient functions necessary for neural network 
learning was not explicitly represented there. In the Galerkin method the 
problem is how to select basis functions, and besides its application is limited 
only to linear partial differential equations. Hence it was required to introduce 
the generalized H-J equation [Saridis (1986),Beard (1997)l. 
In this paper we propose a method to obtain an approximate solution to the 
H-J equation and to realize optimal state feedback control law using a three 
layered neural network. The method is relatively easy when applied to affine 
nonlinear systems, since we have only to approximate the value function in the 
H-J equation with the network such that an error of H-J equation goes to zero. 
When applied to general nonlinear systems, however, its computation becomes 
very complex, because we must approximate both the value function and con- 
trol inputs with neural networks such that necessary optimality conditions for 
the control inputs are satisfied. We can calculate gradient functions with re- 
spect to connection weights and thresholds in the network explicitly by applying 
Lagrange multiple method. Hence learning of the networks is carried out very 
efficiently and systematically. 
Note that the H-J equation does not necessarily possess a unique solution and 
so an approximate solution obtained by the neural network is not guaranteed to 
be the true value function from which the optimal feedback law is synthesized. 
Thus we make a device for learning of the networks, that is, we propose an 
idea to let any approximate solution converge to the true value function, using 
a stabilizing solution of the Riccati equation for the linearized LQ regulator 
problem. 
The usefulness of the proposed method was confirmed from simulation results 
for both affine and general nonlinear systems.

where x(t) E Rn and u(t) E R' 
are the state vector and the control vector, 
respectively. 
We assume the following: 
Assumption 2.1 System (2.lb) is stabilizable in the sence that for any initial 
condition x ( 0 )  there exists a control law u(.) 
such that x(t) -+ 0 as t -+ m. 
Assumption 2.2 f : Rn x R' 
4 Rn is continuously differentiable in (x,u) 
and f (0,O) = 0. 
Assumption 2.3 It holds that q(0) = 0, q ( x )  2 0 ,  and R > 0. 
We design a nonlinear state feed back controller u(t) = a(x(t)) for problem 
(2.1), where a : Rn -+ R' 
is C1 and a(0) = 0. Then the nonlinear opti- 
mal regulator problem (2.1) results in the following stationary Hamilton-Jacobi 
equation 
0 = min H (x, u, VX (x)) 
U 
= min { q ( x )  + uT RU + VX ( x )  
f (x, u)) 
U 
(2.2) 
where, H ( x ,  u, 
Vx(x)) is the Hamiltonian function 
and V ( x )  denotes the value function that is semi-positive definite. 
Further, the stationary H-J equation (2.2) satisfies a boundary condition, 
Meanwhile, a necessary optimality condition 
holds for u satisfying (2.2). Therefore the optimal control must satisfy the 
following partial differential equations.

As mentioned above, the nonlinear optimal regulator problem is equivalent to 
find V ( x )  and u=a(x) which satisfy conditions (2.7)~(2.9) 
at the same time. 
Here let us consider affine nonlinear system 
x = f ( x )  + G ( x ) u  
(2.10) 
From (2.6) 
Solve (2.11) with regard to u to obtain 
Substituting this into (2.7) and taking account of symmetricity of R, we have 
If we can obtain V ( x )  satisfying this equation, then the optimal state feedback 
control law u(x) is given by (2.12).

Firstly, we try to generate an approximate solution to the H-J equation (2.13) 
by using a neural networks. As the neural networks a three layered neural 
network is used : 
where y E Rn and x E R4 are the output and internal state of the neural 
network, respectively and Wl E RQXn, W2 E RnXq, 8 E RQ and a E Rn are the 
connection weight matrices, the threshold and the constant, respectively. 
Further a : Rn -+ 
R4 denotes the sigmoid function, and we use hyperbolic 
tangent functions as the sigmoid function a ( x ) ,  i.e.,

Then the value function V(x) is approximated with y as 
The boundary conditon V(0) = 0 is easily satisfied by taking a = -W2a(8). 
Note that when we set the value function and a like this, vN(0) = 0, vN(x) 2

Hence we derive these gradients, applying the Lagrange multiplier method as 
below. 
Define first the following variable v E Rn: 
Then we have 
Next, to calculate the gradients of le(x)I2, let us define the Lagrangian L with 
Lagrange multipliers X E Rn, p E RQ, y E Rn. 
By the chain rule of derivatives and formulae1 for gradients and symmetricity 
of Va(z), partial derivatives of the Lagrangian L with respect to each variable

By substituting these A, P, y into (3.13)--(3.15) we obtain Vwl L, Vw, L, VeL. 
Then it holds that

Using these gradients, we can apply the steepest descent method to obtain 
optimal connection weights Wl, W2 and threshold 8: 
where a > 0 is a proportional coefficient and k denotes the iteration number. 
Consequently, v$(x) 
in (3.7) is obtained, which yields the optimal state feed- 
back control law given by (2.12), as follows. 
[B] General Nonlinear System Case 
In order to get the optimal feedback law satisfying (2.7)--(2.9) by solving the 
optimal regulator problem (2.1), we must approximate the value function V(x) 
and the state feedback control law u(x) with separate neural networks. Hence 
we use for V(x) the same neural network used in the affine nonlinear case. 
where Wl E RQXn, W2 E RnxQ, el E RQ, and a E Rn(a = -Wzu(01)). In like 
manner as the case [A] the value function V(x) is approximated with y as 
It is noted that the boundary condition V(0) = 0 is easily satisfied by setting 
a = -W2~(81). Next for u(x) we use the neural network

i = 1,2,3,4 Vei{lel(z)12 +

i = 1,2. So we derive these gradients, applying the Lagrange

Introducing the Lagrange multipliers X E Rn, p E Rq, y E Rn, q~ E Rm, 6 E R',

Then in the similar manner as the previous case [A], concrete expressions of

and noticing Vwi{le1(x)I2 + IIe2(~)11~)

As the results both the solution V N ( x )  
to the generalized H-J equations (2.7)- 
(2.9) and the optimal state feedback law uN(x) are obtained. This optimal 
state feedback control law 
becomes the solution for nonlinear optimal regulator problem (2.1)

IMPROVEMENT OF LEARNING ALGORITHM OF NEURAL 
NETWORK 
Since it does not necessarily follow that partial differential equations (2.7)--(2.9) 
possess a unique solution, an arbitary solution of the H-J equation is not al- 
ways the true value function. This difficulty is caused by the fact that the 
H-J equation is only a necessary condition for optimality. In general it is very 
hard to prove that any approximate solution of the H-J equation converges to 
the true value function V(x). However, we can improve the possibility that 
the approximate solution converges to the value function, making a device on 
learning of networks. 
It is not guaranteed that vN(x) obtained from the learning problem (3.6) or 
(3.43) coincides with the value function V(x) of the performance functional 
(2.1~). In fact it sometime happens that vN(x) # V(x). This is caused by 
that in general the solution to the H-J equation is not unique. Accordingly, we 
need a device of learning such that vN (x) converges to the true value function 
V(x). 
For simplicity let us assume there exits u = uO(x, Vx(x)) satisfying (2.9) 
around (x, u) = (0,O) globally. Substitute this into (2.7) to get 
The solution to the H-J equation (4.1) is not unique because the H-J equation 
is only a necessary condition for optimality. The value function of problem 
(2.1) certainly satisfies the H-J equation (4.1) but there may exist any other 
solutions. Let us here denote the value function (2.4) especially by VO(x) and 
distinguish it from any other solutions V(x). 
The minimum solution among semi-positive definite solutions to the H-J equa- 
tion (4.1) coincides with VO(x). But asymptotical stability of the closed-loop 
system is not guaranteed by implementing the optimal control law uO(x, Vj: (x)). 
If there exists the solution V(x) of the H-J equation such that x = f (x, uO(x, 
Vz(x))) becomes asymptotically stable, then we call it the stabilizing solution 
denoted by V-(x). The following lemma gives a condition that V-(2) exists 
uniquely [Kucera (1972) ,Schaft (l996)I. 

474 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Lemma 4.1 Assume that the Hamilton matrix 
does not possess pure imaginary eigenvalues and {A, B} is stabilizable, where 
A = f x  (0, 0), B = f ,  (0, 
0), 2Q = q,, (0). Then the H- J equation possesses 
the unique stabilizing solution V -  ( x )  . 
As this lemma holds, it is known from the uniqueness of the stabilizing solu- 
tion that V-(2) becomes equal to the minimum performance function for the 
stabilizing optimal control problem, that is 
At this time the stabilizing optimal control law is given by uO(x, 
V i ( x ) ) .  Fur- 
ther it can be easily shown [Schaft (1996)] that V-(x) is the maximum solution 
of the H-J equation. 
min {1m(4(x) + uTRu) dt 
U 
Now VO(x) 
was the minimum among the semi-positive definite solutions of the 
H-J equation (4.1), while V-(x) is the maximum one. Hence if there exists 
more than one semi-positive definite solution, then VO(x) 
# V-(x). However if 
the semi-positive definite solution is unique, then it becomes VO(x) 
= V -  (2). 
The uniqueness of semipositive definite solution is guaranteed by assuming de- 
tectability. 
6 = f (1, u), x (t) = x, lim x(t) = 0 
t--too 
Assumption 4.1 { f (x, u), q(x)+uT RU} is detectable. That is, it holds along 
solutions of (2.lb) that lim x(t) = 0 as lirn { q ( x ( t ) )  + ~ ( t ) ~ R u ( t ) }  
= 0. 
t--too 
t+w 
(4.2) 
In order that VO(x) 
exists, it must hold that lim { q ( z ( t ) )  + ~ ( t ) ~ R u ( t ) }  
= 0. 
t+m 
Meanwhile, if we assume the detectability, we have lim x(t) = 0. Therefore 
t--tm 
the optimal regulator problem coincides with the stabilizing optimal regulator 
problem, and so it holds that VO(x) 
= V-(2). Equality of the minimum and 
the maximum solutions indicates the uniqueness of semi-positive definite solu- 
tion. 
In below assume the detectability. Then our aim is to approximate the unique 
semi-positive definite solution to the H-J equation by the neural network. 
To make matters worth, however, it happens sometime that V N ( x )  converges 
to something other than V-(x) partially on the way that V N ( x )  is learnt to 

NONLINEAR OPTIMAL REGULATOR 
475 
converge to V-(2). Yet at least in the neighborhood of x = 0 it is easy to 
let VN(x) coincide with V-(2). Moreover, once VN(x) begins to converge to 
V-(x), it does not happen to converge to another solution thereafter. 
The following well-known fact is important for letting vN(x) converge to 
v- (x); 
Under the same assumption of Lemma 1, there exists a unique stabilizing so- 
lution P- to the Riccati equation 
And it holds that 
v2v-(0) = P- 
for the stabilizing solution V-(x) of the H-J equation (4.1). Further, since 
VO (x) = V- (x), it holds V2V0(0) = P- also. 
Now from (4.2) V-(x) takes the minimum V-(0) = 0 and it holds V& (0) = 0. 
Meanwhile VN (2) satisfies VN (0) = 0 and v,N (0) = 0. Thus letting the relation 
hold for VN(x) as well as (4.4), we can make vN(x) coincide with V-(x) = 
VO(x) in the neighborhood of x = 0. 
Here, we show the improvement of learning algorithm as to affine nonlinear sys- 
tem case. Note that we can apply the same approach for the general nonlinear 
system case. 
V2VN(0) can be calculated from (3.7) as 
Put D 
V2VN(0) - P-, then the norm of D, i.e. [ID11 must be required to 
be zero. Therefore we modify the performance function (3.5) for learning as 
follows.

ated by linearizing (5.lb)~(5.ld) and by approximating (5. la) in a quadratic 
form.

where A, b, Q, and r are given as 
Since {A, b) and {&,A)

becomes 
P A  + A ~ P

(5.5) 
and the stabilizing solution P- is calculated as follows. 
Since q(x) = xf +x$ + x: is positive definite, Assumption 4.1 is satisfied. Hence 
the state variables become asymptotically stable by the optimal control law. 
A number of middle layer of the network was taken 20. The learning domain 
wasset a s O =  {(x1,x2,x3)1 - 2  < x l I  2,-1 5 x 2 5  1,-2 5 x 3 5  2) and was 
discretized by an orthogonal lattice. The distance between the adjoining lattice 
points was set as Ax1 = 0.2, Ax2 = 0.1, Ax3 = 0.2. Initial values of Wl, W2 
and 0 were given by random numbers between -0.5 and 0.5. 
The results of optimal feedback control is presented in Figure 5.1 and 5.2 in 
case of initial state x(0) = (1.5, 1, 1.5). Then the value of performance function 
is 19.797. For comparison optimal control in the open-loop style was computed 
by a usual optimization algorithm [Shimizu (1994)] in case of the same initial

CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a method using a neural network to obtain an approximate solu- 
tion of the H-J equation for the nonlinear optimal regulator problem. It was 
confirmed from the simulation results of various examples that the proposed 
method is effective to synthesize the optimal feedback control law of nonlinear 
systems. 
With regard to learning methods of the neural network, however, there is room 
for further improvements. To obtain a global optimum of connection weights 
and thresholds, the so called pattern mode search [Saridis (1986)] is considered 
to apply. How to initialize the neural network is also our future problem.

Abstract: In this paper, the H ,  control problem based on a state observer 
for descriptor systems is investigated. The motivation of this paper is two-fold. 
One is to extend the corresponding H, results for linear time invariant systems 
to the case for descriptor systems. The other is to obtain more explicit results 
compared to those in the existing literature. F'rom the results obtained here, 
one can figure out some special features for singular systems, which are different 
from normal linear systems. Also the approach adopted here is pure algebraic, 
which is easy to understand. As to the results, a necessary and sufficient con- 
dition for the solvability of the H, control problem based observer design is 
obtained in terms of a Generalized Algebraic Riccati Inequality (GARI). More- 
over, the desired controller is also explicitly constructed 'in this case.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
H, control theory in normal linear time-invariant systems has made signifi- 
cant progress since the fundamental work was published in 1981 Zames (1981). 
Within the state-space approach, the existing results can be roughly classi- 
fied into two categories. One is the state feedback H, control problems, such 
as Petersen (1987); Khargonekar et a1 (1988); Zhou et a1 (1988); Stoorvogel 
(1990); Scherer (1992) and the other category is the output feedback problems, 
see Doyel et a1 (1989); Sampei rt a1 (1990); Gahinet et a1 (1994); Barabanov 
(1998). 
Descriptor systems can be seen as a generalization of the normal linear time- 
invariant systems and they can describe many practical systems that the normal 
systems can not model properly (e.g., see Verhese et a1 (1981); Dai (1989); 
Brenan et a1 (1996); Zhang (1997)). Though a lot of concepts and results in 
the normal linear time invariant systems have been generalized to the case of 
descriptor systems Cobb (1984); Lewis (1986); Dai (1989), the research on the 
H, control problems for descriptor systems is still far behind compared to 
that for normal linear time invariant systems. Recently, output feedback H, 
control problems for the descriptor systems using state-space method have been 
investigated Masubuchi et a1 (1997); Wang et a1 (1998). Further, static state- 
feedback H, control problems for the descriptor systems is also examined in 
Gao et a1 (1999). 
The authors in Masubuchi et a1 (1997) solved the H, control problem 
based output feedback. The main result was given in terms of two generalized 
algebraic Riccatti equations (GAREs) with constraints. One possible algorithm 
was proposed for solving the two GAREs. It can be seen that it is not trivial 
to solve these GAREs with constraints. The results in Wang et a1 (1998); Gao 
et a1 (1999) were based on bounded real lemma for descriptor systems. 
In this paper, we also study the H, control problem based on state feed 
back for the descriptor systems. However, the state-feedback here is based on a 
state observer rather than static state feedback as in Gao et a1 (1999). In terms 
of one GARI, a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of our H, 
control problem is obtained. Moreover, based on the solution of one GARI, 
an admissible controller is constructed explicitly. It should be noted that the 
results obtained here are much more explicit compared to those reported in 
Masubuchi et a1 (1997) since it only needs one GARI instead of two GARIs. In

addition, we also investigate this result further when the orthogonal condition 
defined in this paper is satisfied. 
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we will present some pre- 
liminary results. The main result will be given in section 3 and conclusions are 
given in section 4.

PRELIMINARIES 
Consider the descriptor system 
where x E Rn is the descriptor state variable, w E Rm is the exogenous input 
variable (such as reference signal, command etc.), u E Rk is the control input 
variable, z E RP is the controlled output variable, y E RQ is the measured 
output variable; E, A E RnXn, B1, B2, C1, Cz, Dl2 and Dgl are all constant 
real matrices with compatible dimensions. Moreover, it is generally assumed 
that ranlc(E) < n. The following concepts will be used and they are mainly 
from Dai (1989). 
1. The system (2.1) is said to be regular, if the polynomial (with respect to 
A) det(AE - A) # 0. 
2. The finite dynamic modes of the system (2.1) are the finite eigenvalues of 
(E, A). 
3. If all the finite dynamic modes lie in the open left half plane, Then the 
system (2.1) is said to be stable. 
4. The infinite eigenvalues of (E, A) corresponding to such relative eigen- 
vectors that their ranks are larger than 1 are said to be impulsive modes. 
5. If the system (2.1) has no impulsive mode, Then it is said to be impulse- 
free;. 
6. The triple (E, A, C) is said to be finite dynamics detectable if there exists 
a constant matrix M such that the pair (E, A + M C )  is stable. 

484 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
7. The triple (E, A, C) is said to be impulse observable if there exists a 
constant matrix N such that the pair (E, A + NC) is impulse-free. 
Now one can present the following lemmas and definition for singular systems 
and they are useful to understand the results in this paper. 
Lemma 2.1 Dai (1989) The regular pair (E, A) is impulse-free if and only if 
deg det(sE - A) = rankE 
Definition 2.1 The descriptor system (2.1) is said to be admissible i f  it is 
regular, stable and impulse-free. 
Lemma 2.2 Dai (1989) The triple (E, A, C )  is finite dynamics detectable and 
impulse observable i f  and only if there exists a constant matrix L such that 
(E, A + LC) is stable and impulse-free or equivalently admissible. 
For the descriptor system (2.1), many researchers have devoted their effort 
to the output feedback H, control problems Takaba et a1 (1994); Masubuchi 
et a1 (1997); Wang et a1 (1998). One important motivation is that the output 
feedback can be realized easily. However, the corresponding solutions to H, 
control problems are much more complicated compared to the case of state 
feedback control. Since the state of a system contains all the essential infor- 
mation for the system, a controller based on state-feedback can lead to a more 
effective control. Particularly, the corresponding solution to the H, control 
problems may become much more explicit Gao et a1 (1999); Wang et a1 (1998). 
The problem for state feedback control is that all the state variables are not 
available in practice, so we will choose to use a state observer in this paper 
and investigate the corresponding state-feedback H, control problem for the 
descriptor system within this framework. This problem is between the output 
feedback and static feed back control. As can be seen in the sequel, it is not a 
trivial special case of output feedback control. With solving this problem for 
singular systems, one can visulize the difference more clearly between descriptor 
systems and normal systems. 
As in the Full Information case Doyel et a1 (1989) for linear time-invariant 
system, it is also assumed here that the exogenous input signal w is always 
available. 
The next lemma gives a result on the design of state observer for singular 
systems.

Lemma 2.3 Dai (1989) Assume that (E, A, C2) is finite dynamics detectable. 
Then the following dynamic system is a state observer for the system (2.1) 
where matrix L is such that (E, A + LC2) is stable and impulsive free. 
In this paper, a controller based on the observer (2.2) is assumed to be in the 
following form. 
Remark 2.1 It should be noted that the state feedback controller given above 
is diferent from the output feedback controller given by Masubuchi et a1 (1997) 
In the controller (2.5'), there are only two feedback parameters rather than 
the four parameters present in (2.4). It can be seen late in this paper that the 
results based on the controller (2.5') are much more explicit. 
The next result is the basic result for H, control for singular systems. It 
gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a singular system to be H, norm 
bounded.

The H, control problem investigated here is to design a state-feedback con- 
troller (2.3) for the system (2.1) such that the resulting closed-loop system is 
admissible and the H, norm of the transfer function matrix from w to z is 
strictly less than a prescribed positive number y. In the next section, we will 
give solution of this problem.

MAIN RESULTS 
In order to consider the H, problem for the descriptor system (2.1), the fol- 
lowing assumptions are made. 
(Al) (E, A, C2) is finite dynamics detectable and impulse observable. 
(A2) rankDl2 = k. 
The next lemma is an important result for the proof of our main result. 
Lemma 3.1 Assume that all the following matrices have appropriate dimen- 
sions. Let

where D is of full column rank. Then 
9(X : A + B2K, B1, C + DK) = \k(X : A, B1, B2, C, D) 
+{D[K + (DTD)-~(B$'x + D~c)])~{D[K

Proof 
@(X: A+B2K,B1,C+DK=\k(X: A,B1,B2,C,D)+II 
where

- (xTB2 + CTD)(DTD)-I ( B ~ X

Therefore, 
@(X : A,B1,B2,C,D) = 9(X : A,Bl,C)- 
(BTX + D ~ c ) ~ ( D ~ D ) - ~ ( B ? x  
+ DTc) = 9(X : A + B2K, B1, C + DK) 
-{D[K + (D~D)-~(B;X + D~c)])~{D[K

+ DTC)I) 
Now the main result of this paper can be stated as below. 
Theorem 3.1 Suppose that assumptions ( A l )  and (A2) hold. Then for the 
descriptor system (2.1), the following statements are equivalent. 
(i) There exists a state-feedback controller (2.3) such that the resulting closed- 
loop system is admissible and the H,-norm 
of transfer function matrk 
Tzw(s) from w to z is strictly less than a prescribed positive number y, 
ie., 
II Tzw(s) II,<

(ii) There exists a solution to the following GAR1 
with a constraint 
E ~ X  
= X ~ E  
2 o 
When (ii) holds, the matrix K in the controller (2.3) can be constructed as 
and L in the controller (2.3) satisfies the requirement that (E,A + LC2) is 
admissible. 
Proof (i)+(ii): It can be seen that the closed-loop system is 
Let 

488

then the system (3.4) becomes 
Denote 
- 
C = [ 
Ci 
Cl +DuK ] 
then the closed-loop system (3.5) can be written as 
= ~ O + B W  
z = &I 
where 
From Lemma 2.4, there exists a solution X  satisfying the following inequality 
with the constraint 
E ~ X  
= X ~ E  
2 0 
Partition X  as in A 
xi x2 
X =  [x, x4] 
then the (2, 2)-block of the matrix in the left side of the inequalities (3.7) and 
(3.8) respectively are 
ETx4 = X ~ E  
2 0 
According to Lemma 3.1, one can obtain 

H, CONTROL BASED ON STATE OBSERVER FOR DESCRIPTOR SYSTEMS 
489 
Then the statement (ii) is proved. 
(ii)+(i): 
Since the descriptor system (2.1) satisfies assumption (Al), by 
Lemma 2.1, there exists a constant matrix L such that (E, A + LC2) is admis- 
sible. Then the observer (2.2) exists by Lemma 2.3. Now let 
Then by Lemma 3.1, 
jFrom Lemma 2.4, the pair (E, A + B2K) is admissible and 
With chosen L and K above in the controller (2.3), the resulting closed-loop 
system is the system (3.4) and its transfer function matrix from w to z is 
In order to complete the proof, it suffices to prove that the system (3.4) is 
admissible. Notice that 
and (E, A + LC2) and (E, A + B2K) are stable. Then the closed-loop system 
is stable. Further,

E 
According to Lemma 2.1, one can see that the closed-loop system is impulse- 
free. Hence the closed-loop system is admissible. 
It can be seen that the H, 
control problem based on state feedback can be 
solved via one GARE with constraint. It should be noted that this result is 
not a special case for output feedback control, which involves two GAREs with 
constraints. Another important feature for this result is that there is only one 
parameter in the GARE obtained here instead of two parameters proposed in 
output case Masubuchi et a1 (1997). Moreover, if assumption (A2) is replaced 
by the following orthogonal condition: 
(A2') DT2[C1 Dl21 = [0 I] Then Theorem 3.1 can be simplified. 
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that assumptions (Al) and (A2') hold. Then the fol- 
lowing statements are equivalent for system (2.1). 
(i) There exists a controller (2.3) such that the resulting closed-loop system 
is admissible and 
II Tzw(s) IIw< 7 
(ii) There exists a solution X satisfying the following GARI 
with constraint 
E T x  = x T E  2 0. 
When (ii) hold, the matrix K in the controller (2.3) can be constructed 
as 
A 
K= - BTX 
(3.12) 
and L in the controller (2.3) is such that (E, A + LC2) is admissible. 
In this section, the H, 
control problem based on state feedback is investi- 
gated and a sufficient and necessary condition in terms of GARI are obtained.

It should be noted the G A H  obtained here is much more simple than those 
obtained in Masubuchi et a1 (1997) in two ways. 
(i) Only one parameter is involved here. This greatly simplifies the complex- 
ity of solving the GAH. 
(ii) Only one GARI is required. 
This motivates us that state feed back controller design is much easier if 
the estimated state information is available. In this case, the algorithm for 
solving G A H  with constraints proposed in Masubuchi et a1 (1997) can also 
be significantly simplified. We will not discuss this simplification here since it 
is technically trivial.

CONCLUSIONS 
For descriptor system (2.1), much effort of research on H, control problems in 
the existing literature are devoted to output feedback case. In this paper, we 
obtained results on H, control based on a state observer for the system (2.1). 
With mild assumptions, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the 
solvability of our H, control problem in terms of a GARI. Furthermore, the 
construction of the desired controller presented here is much more explicit. 
It should be noted that the results obtained here is not a trivial case for 
output case as revealed in previous section. The algorithm for solving the 
GAH can be developed similarly to that in Masubuchi et a1 (1997).

Abstract: In this paper, we consider vector variational inequalities with set- 
valued mappings over product sets in a real linear topological space setting. 
By employing concepts of relative pseudomonotonicity with variable weights, 
we establish several existence results for generalized vector variational inequali- 
ties and for systems of generalized vector variational inequalities. These results 
strengthen previous existence results which were based on the usual monotonic- 
ity type assumptions. 
Key words: Vector variational inequalities, set-valued mappings, product sets, 
relative pseudomonotonicity, existence results.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Vector variational inequalities were introduced by Giannessi e.g., Giannessi 
(1980) in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space as a natural extension of scalar 
variational inequalities. Since then, various classes of vector variational in- 
equalities were studied both in finite- and in infinite-dimensional spaces; see 
e.g., Hadjisavvas et a1 (1998). It is well known that a number of equilibrium 
type problems arising in Economics, Game Theory and Transportation have a 
decomposable structure, namely, they can be formulated as vector variational 
inequalities over Cartesian product sets; see e.g. Yuan (1998)-Yang et al(1997) 
and the references therein. At the same time, most existence results for such 
problems are based on the known fixed point techniques, which require either 
the feasible set (otherwise, the corresponding subset associated to a coercivity 
condition) be compact in the strong topology or the cost mapping possess cer- 
tain continuity type properties with respect to the weak topology; see e.g. Yuan 
(1998); Ansari et a1 (1999). Usually, to essentially weaken these assumptions 
one make use of the Ky Fan Lemma (Ky Fan (1961)) together with certain 
monotonicity type properties regardless of the decomposable structure of VI; 
see e.g. Hadjisavvas et a1 (1998); Oettli et a1 (1998). However, it was noticed 
by Bianchi (1993) that infinite-dimensional extensions of the concepts of M- 
and P-mappings are not sufficient to apply the Ky Fan Lemma for deriving 
exstence results. 
In this paper, we develop some other approach, which is based on the invari- 
ance of the solution sets of decomposable equilibrium and variational inequality 
problems with respect to certain linear trasformations. This property enables 
one to extend the usual (generalized) monotonicity properties. Rosen (1965) 
introduced such an extension of strict monotonicity to establish the uniqueness 
of solutions for non-cooperative games with scalar payoffs. Being based on the 
same property, Konnov (2001) introduced new (generalized) monotonicity con- 
cepts, which are adjusted to a decomposable structure of the initial problem, 
and proved new existence results for scalar variational inequalities in a Banach 
space. These new relative monotonicity concepts can be regarded as inter- 
mediate ones between the usual monotonicity and order monotonicity ones. 
Allevi et a1 (2001) extended the results from Konnov (2001) to vector varia- 
tional inequalities with set-valued mappings over the Cartesian product of a 
finite number of sets, where the parameters associated to relative (generalized) 

DECOMPOSABLE GENERALIZED VECTOR VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES 
499 
monotonicity are constant. Now we consider the case where the parameters (or 
weights) are variables, thus extending the results from Konnov (2001); Allevi 
et a1 (2001). Namely, we establish existence results for generalized vector varia- 
tional inequalities and for systems of generalized vector variational inequalities 
in a topological vector space by employing new relative (pseudo)monotonicity 
concepts for set-valued mappings.

PROBLEM FORMULATIONS AND BASIC FACTS 
Let I be the set of indexes {I,. . . , m). For each s E I, let E, be a real linear 
topological space and Us be a nonempty subset of E,. Set 
u = nu,. 
Let F be a real linear topological space with a partial order induced by a 
convex, closed and solid cone C. 
Set Ry= {(CLE Rm I pi > 0 , 1  I i  I m ) .  
For each s E I, let Gs : U + 2L(E8tF) be a mapping so that if we set 
then G : U + 2L(E>F), where E = nsEI 
Es. That is, if we take arbitrary points 
u E U and v, E Es, then Gs(u)v, is a subset of F, hence, for each v E E, the 
sum 
is a subset of F. The generalized vector variational inequality problem is to find 
an element u* = (u:),~~ 
E U such that 
for brevity, we denote by GVVI(I, U, G) problem (2.3). 
Together with GVVI(I, U, G) we shall consider its dual formulation, denoted 
by DGVVI(I, U, G), which is to find an element u* = (u:),~~ E U such that 
Next, we shall also consider the system of generalized vector variational 
inequalities, denoted by SGVVI(I, U, G), which is to find an element u* =

Definition 1 The mapping G : U --t 2L(E9F), 
defined by (2.2), is said to be 
(a) u-hemicontinuous if for any u,v E U and X E [ O , l ] ,  the mapping X + 
G(u + Xz)z with z = v - u is upper semicontinuous at O+; 
(b) pseudo (w, P)-monotone if for all u, v E U we have 
G,(v)(u, - v,) g -intC Vs E I I 
GG,(uus - us) $l 
-intC. 
,€I 
In Allevi et a1 (2001), the following result has been proved. 
Lemma 2.1 Suppose that the set U, defined by (2.1), is convex and that the 
mapping G : U --t 2L(EtF), defined by (2.2), is u-hemicontinuous. Then 
DGVVI(I, U, G) implies GVVI(I, U, G). 
Clearly, SGVVI(I, U, G) implies DGVVI(I, U, G) if G is pseudo (w, P)-mo- 
notone and, also, GVVI(I, U, G) always implies SGVVI(I, U, G). Combining 
the statements above, we obtain the following equivalence result. 
Proposition 2.1 Suppose that the set U, defined by (2.1), is convex and that 
the mapping G : U + 2L(E9F), 
defined by (2.21, is u-hemicontinuous and pseudo 
(w, P)-monotone. Then GVVI(I, U, G), DGVVI(I, U, G), and SGVVI(I, U, G) 
are equivalent. 
3 
RELATIVE MONOTONICITY TYPE PROPERTIES 
Let G : U + 2L(E1F) be a mapping of form (2.2) and let y : U + Ry be a 
single-valued mapping. Then we can define the composite mapping [y o GI of 
form (2.2) as follows 
The following result enables us to reduce GVVI with "weighted" mapping 
to a usual SGVVI. 
Lemma 3.1 GVVI(I, U, y o G) implies SGVVI(I, U, 
G). 

DECOMPOSABLE GENERALIZED VECTOR VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES 
501 
Proof: Clearly GVVI(I, U, y o G) implies SGVVI(I, U, y o G) which is equiv- 
alent to SGVVI(I, U, G). 
0 
Under certain additional assumptions, we also can obtain an equivalence 
result. 
Proposition 3.1 Suppose that the set U, defined by (2.1), is convex and that 
yoG is u-hemicontinous and pseudo (w, P)-monotone. Then GVVI(I, U, y oG) 
is equivalent to SGVVI(I, U, G). 
Proof: GVVI(I, U, y o G) is now equivalent to SGVVI(I, U, y o G) due to 
Proposition 2.1 with using y o G instead of G. Obviously, SGVVI(I, U, y o G) 
is equivalent to SGVVI(I, U, G).

In Konnov (2001), new monotonicity type concepts for single-valued scalar 
mappings, which extend the usual ones, were proposed. Their extensions to 
the the multi-valued vector case involving constant weights, were suggested in 
Allevi et a1 (2001). Now we propose relative monotonicity concepts for vector 
multivalued mappings with non constant weights. 
Definition 2 The mapping G : U -+ 2L(E>F), defined by (2.2), is said to be 
(a) relatively monotone if there exists a mapping a : U -+ Ry such that for all 
U , V  E U, we have 
(b) relatively pseudomonotone if there exist mappings a ,  ,6 : U -+ Ry such that 
for all u, v E U, we have 
,&(v)G. (v)(v. - u.) 
-intC + a,(u)~,(u)(u~ - v,) $i

In what follows, we reserve the symbols a and ,6 for the parameters associated 
with relative (pseudo)monotonicity. 
The following well-known Ky Fan Lemma Ky Fan (1961), Lemma 1 (see 
also Yuan (1998), p.6) will play a crucial role in deriving existence results for 
GVVI's and SGWI's. First this result was established in Ky Fan (1961),

Lemma 1 under a Hausdorff space setting. We give a somewhat strengthened 
version of this assertion (see e.g. Yuan (1998), p.6). 
Proposition 3.2 Let X and Y be non-empty sets in a topological vector space 
E and Q : X + 2Y be such that 
(i) for each x E X, Q(x) is closed in Y; 
(ii) for each finite subset {xl, - - , xn) of X ,  its convex hull is contained in 
the corresponding union U~=lQ(xi); 
(iii) there exists a point 3 E X such that Q(3) is compact. 
Then

EXISTENCE RESULTS 
In this section, in addition to the general assumptions, we shall suppose that the 
space L(E, F) is topologized in such a manner that the mapping T : Z x U -+ F ,  
defined by T(g, u) = g(u), is continuous, if Z is a compact subset of L(E, F). 
As usual, for each set B 5 E, we denote by B its closure. First we establish 
existence results for SGVVI(I, U, G). 
Theorem 4.1 Let U be convex and compact. Suppose that G has nonempty 
and compact values and is relatively pseudomonotone, and that a o G is u- 
hemicontinuous. Then SGVVI(I, U, G) is solvable. 
Proof: Define set-valued mappings A, B : U + 2'

Let z be in the convex hull of any finite subset {vl,. . . , vn) of K. Then z =

F'rom relative pseudomonotonicity of G it follows that B(v) c A(v), but, for 
each v E U, A(v) is closed. In fact, let {ue) be a net in A(v) such that ue 
converges to ii E U. Then, for each 0, there exist elements 
E G,(v), s E I, 
such that 
Since G(v) is compact, without loss of generality we can suppose that

We conclude that B E A(v), i.e. A(v) is closed. Therefore, B(v) C A(v) and (i) 
now implies (ii). 
(iii) SGVVI(I, U, G) is solvable. 
F'rom (ii) it follows that DGVVI(I, U, a o G) is solvable. Applying now Lem- 
mas 2.1 and 3.1, we conclude that SGVVI(I, U, G) is solvable. The proof is 
complete.

Using the additional pseudo(w, P)-monotonicity and u-hemicontinuity as- 
sumptions on G, we obtain existence results of solutions for GVVI(I, U, G). 
Theorem 4.2 Let G be relatively pseudomonotone and pseudo (w, P)-monoto- 
ne. Suppose that G has nonempty and compact values and that a o G  and G are 
u-hemicontinuous. Suppose that U is convex and compact. Then GVVI(I, U, 
G) 
is solvable. 
The proof follows from Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 2.1. 
By employing the corresponding coercivity condition, we obtain existence 
results on unbounded sets. 
Corollary 4.1 Suppose that G has nonempty and compact values and is rel- 
atively pseudomonotone, and that a o G is u-hemicontinuous. Suppose that U 
is convex and closed and that there exist a compact subset V of E and a point

Proof: In this case it suffices to follow the proof of Theorem 4.1 and observe 
- 
that B(5) C V under the above assumptions. Indeed, it follows that B(6) is 
compact, hence the assertion of Step (i) will be true due to Proposition 3.2 as 
well.

We can now obtain an exitence result for GVVI on unbounded sets. 
Corollary 4.2 Let G be relatively pseudomonotone and pseudo (w, P)-mono- 
tone. Suppose that G has nonempty and compact values and that a o G and G 
are u-hemicontinuous. Suppose that U is convex and closed and that there exist 
a compact subset V of E and a point 6 E V f l  U such that (4.1) holds. Then 
GVVI(I, U, G) is solvable. 
The proof follows from Corollary 4.1 and the definition of pseudo (w, P)- 
monotonicity.

EXISTENCE RESULTS IN BANACH SPACES 
By choosing different topologies, one can specify the above existence results for 
less general classes of topological vector spaces. For example, in this section, 
we specialize these results for a Banach space setting. 
Namely, we suppose that E and F are real Banach spaces and that C is a 
convex, closed and solid cone C in F .  We shall apply the weak topology in E, 
the strong topology in F, and the strong operator topology in L(E, F). For 
this reason, we need the concept of a completely continuous mapping. 
Definition 4 A mapping is said to be completely continuous if it maps each 
weakly convergent sequence into a strongly convergent sequence. 
If a mapping Q : E + 2L(E9F) has nonempty and compact values and each el- 
ement q E Q(v) is completely continuous, then the mapping T : Q(v) x U --+ F, 
defined by T(q, u) = q(u), will be continuous in the (strong) x (weak) topology. 
Taking this argument into account and following the proof of Theorem 4.1 and 
Corollary 4.1, we obtain an existence result of solutions for SGVVI(I, U, G). 
Corollary 5.1 Let G be relatively pseudomonotone. Suppose that a o G is u- 
hemicontinuous, G has nonempty and compact values and that, for each v E U, 
each element of G(v) is completely continuous. Suppose that U is convex and 
that at least one of the following assumptions holds: 
(i) U is weakly compact; 
(ii) U is closed and there exist a weakly compact subset V of E and a point 
C E V n U such that (4.1) holds. 
Then SGVVI(I, U, G) is solvable. 
Adding the pseudo(w, P)-monotonicity and u-hemicontinuity assumptions 
on G, we obtain an analogue of Theorem 4.2 in Banach spaces. 
Corollary 5.2 Let all the assumptions of Corollary 5.1 hold and let G be 
pseudo (w, P)-monotone and u-hemicontinuous. Then GVVI(I, U, G) is solv- 
able.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The following geometrical lemma was established in Fan (1961): 
Lemma 1.1 Let X be a nonempty compact convex set in a Hausdorff topo- 
logical vector space E. Let A be a closed subset of X x X with the following 
properties: 
(a) (x, x) E A for every x E X ;  
(b) Vx E X ,  the set { y  E X : (x, y) $ A) is convex or empty. 
Then there exists a point xo E X such that xo x X c A. 
Subsequently, a slight generalization of Fan's lemma was given in Takahashi 
(1976) in the following form: 
Lemma 1.2 Let X be a nonempty compact convex set in a Hausdorff topolog- 
ical vector space. Let A be a subset of X x X having the following properties: 
(i) For any y E X ,  the set {x E X : (x, y) E A) is closed; 
(ii) (x, x) E A for every x E X ;  
(iii) For any x E X ,  the set { y  E X : (x, y) $! A) is convex. 
Then there exists a point xo E X such that xo x X c A. 
Later, Ha gave another generalization of Fan's geometric lemma by relaxing, 
among the others, the compactness condition (see Ha (1980)). 
Lemma 1.3 Let E, F be Hausdorff topological vector spaces, X c E, Y c F ,  
be nonempty convex subsets and let A C X x Y be a subset such that 
(a) V y  E Y ,  the set { x  E X : (x, y) E A) is closed in X ;  
(b) Vx E X ,  the set { y  E Y : (x, y) $! A) is convex or empty. 
Suppose that there exists a subset I' of A and a compact convex subset K of X 
such that I? is closed in X x Y and 
(c) V y  E Y ,  the set {x E K : (x, y) E I?) is nonempty and convex. 
Then there exists a point xo E K such that xo x Y c A.

Remark 1.1 Both Lemma 1.1 and 1.2 are special cases of Lemma 1.3 with 
X = Y  = K a n d r =  {(x,x) : x  E X ) .  
In this paper, we first give a variation of the geometric lemma of Fan et al, 
and then by applying the result, we prove an existence theorem of solutions for 
set-valued vector equilibrium problem.

PRELIMINARIES 
We shall use the following notations and definitions in this paper. 
Let A be a nonempty set. We denote by 2A the family of all subsets of A. 
If A is a subset of a topological vector space E, we shall denote by clA the 
closure of A in E, and by co A the convex hull of A. Also in E ,  the convex hull 
of its finite subset will be called a polytope. 
Let X, Y be topological spaces and F : X -+ 2Y be a set-valued map. The 
graph of F is the set Gr ( F )  := {(x, y) E X x Y : y E F(x)), and F is said to 
have a closed graph if Gr ( F )  is a closed subset of X x Y. For B c Y, we set 
F-(B) := { x  E X : F(x) n B # 0 )  which is the lower inverse of B under F. 
Recall also the following definitions from Tian (1992). 
Definition 2.1 A set-valued map F : X --+ 2Y is said to be transfer closed- 
valued on X i f  for any x E X and y $! F(x), there exists an z E X such that 
Y $! cl W z ) .  
Let us also mention the well known fixed point theorem of Kakutani (1941). 
Theorem 2.1 Let X be a nonempty compact convex subset in some finite di- 
mensional space lRn and let the set-valued map F : X --+ 2X have closed graph 
and nonempty convex vaules. Then F has a fixed point x* E F(x*).

Theorem 3.1 Let E, F be Hausdorff topological vector spaces and X C E,

compact convex subset, and 0, r : K -+ 2Y be set-valued maps such that

(a) the set-valued map y + A-(y) := {x E X : (x, y) E A) is transfer closed- 
valued on Y; 
(b) Vx E K, the set {y E Y : (x, y) 4 B) is convex or empty; 
(c) for every polytope P in Y, there exists a finite subset {xl, . . . , x,) 
of K

such that P c U I'(xi); 
i= 1 
(d) for every polytope P in Y, r(x) n P is closed in P for each x in K; and 
(e) Vy E Y, the set W(y) is convex. 
Then there exists a point xo E K such that xo x Y C A. 
Proof: Suppose to the contrary that for each x E K ,  there exists y E Y such 
that x 4 A-(y). Then, by (a) x 4 cl A-(y') for some y' E Y. Hence we have 
K C U V, where Vy := {Z E X : z $! clA-(y)). By the compactness of

On the other hand, by (c) there exists a fintie subset {xl, . . . , x,) of K such 
n 
that P c U r(xi). Let A := co {xl, . . . , x,) 
C K .  Define a set-valued map 
i=l 
H : A + 2A by H(x) := co {xi : p(x) E I'(xi)) for each x in A. Then each 
H(x) is a nonempty closed convex subset of A. Moreover, H has a closed

graph in A x A. Indeed, let (v, w) E A x A\Gr (H), i.e. w 6 
H(v). Then there 
exists an open neighborhood V of w in A which is disjoint from H(v). Suppose 
H(v) = co {xi : i E J) for some J c {I,. . . , n). Then p(v) 6 
r(xj) for j 6 J. 
Therefore by (d), U := p-l

) 
A. If z E U, then p(z) 4 r(xj) for j 6 J, and so H(z) c H(v). This implies 
V n H(z) = 0 for all z E U. Hence we have an open neighborhood U x V of 
(v, w) which does not intersect the graph of H, that is, the graph Gr (H) is 
closed. 
Applying the Kakutani's fixed point theorem, we have a point 5 E A such 
that 1 E H(5). If H (5) = co {xj : j E Jo) for some Jo c {I, . . . , n), then 
p(1) E r(xj) c R(xj) for every j E Jo, i.e. xj E ER-[p(~)],Vj

R-[p(1)] is convex by (e) and 5 is a convex combination of {xj : j E Jo), we 
have 5 E R-[p(5)]. And so (5,p(Z)) E Gr (R) C B, contradicting (3.1). The 
theorem is proven.

alent condition (b ') below.

(b') + (b): let (x, Pi) $ B for i = 1,. . . , n with x E K and let z = Xlyl +

(x, z) $ B. Suppose otherwise that (x,z) E B. Then, x E K n B-(z), and so 
n 
by (b') we have x E U B-(yi) n K. This implies that for some 1 I j I n,

Thus, the theorem below is equivalent to Theorem 3.1.

SET-VALUED VECTOR EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM 
Let W be a topological vector space ordered by a pointed closed convex cone 
P. An order relation in W can be defined by x Ip iff y - x E P. Let E, F be 
Hausdorff topological vector spaces and X c E, Y c F be nonempty subsets 
with Y convex. 
Let K C X be a compact convex subset and let @ : X x Y + 2W be a 
set-valued map. We are interested in the problem of finding 
xo E K such that @(xo, y) c P 
holds for all y E Y .  This problem is called a set-valued vector equilibrium 
problem, and such a point xo is said to be an equilibrium point. 
If @ is a single-valued map, then the above problem becomes the vector 
equilibrium problem; see for example Blum and Oettli (1994) and Giannessi 
(2000) and the references therein. 

GEOMETRIC LEMMA 
515 
Based on the result of Theorm 3.1, we are now ready to prove an existence 
theorem for the set-valued vector equilibrium problem. 
Theorem 4.1 Let R,I? : K + 2Y be set-valued maps such that Gr (I?) C 
Gr (0). Suppose that 
(i) the set-valued map y + {x E X : @(x, y) C P) is transfer closed-valued; 
(ii) Vx E K, the set {y E Y : @(x, y) 
P) is convex or empty; 
(iii) V(x, y) E Gr (a), @(x, y) c P; 
(iv) Vy E Y, the set a- (y) is convex; 
(v) Vx E K, the set r(x) is closed; and 
(vi) Vy E Y, there exists an open neighborhood N(y) of y such that 
Then there exists xo E K such that @(xo, y) c P for all y E Y. 
Proof: If we can show that all the conditions (a)-(e) of Theorem 3.1 are 
satisfied, then we may invoke the theorem to conclude the existence of an 
equilibrium point xo E K. To this end, We define A := {(x, y) E X x Y : 
@(x, y) C P) and B := A. It follows from (i) and (ii) that conditions (a) and (b) 
in Thoerem 3.1 are satisfied. Also it is clear that (iii) implies Gr (0) c B c A, 
(iv) implies (e), and (v) implies (d) of Theorem 3.1. It remains to show that 
condition (c) of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied. Indeed, let Q be a polytope of Y. For 
each y E Q, by condition (vi) we know that there exists an open neighborhood 
N(y) of y such that M(y) := n I?-(v) # 0. Since Q is compact, there 
" E N ( Y )  
e 
exists a finite family {yl, . . . , y,) C Y such that Q c (J N(yi). With each 
i=l 
M(yi) # 0, we may take a point xi E M(yi); consequently N(yi) c I'(xi) and 
T 
so Q c U l?(xi). Thus, condition (c) is satisfied. We can now conclude from 
i=l 
Theorem 3.1 the existence of an equilibrium point xo E K. The theorem is 
proven. 
Remark 4.1 Condition (ii) is satisfied when for every x E K the set-valued 
map @(x, -) : Y + 2W has the following P-properly quasiconvexity property 
(see Kuroiwa (1996)). 

516 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Definition 4.1 A set-valued map 4 : Y -+ 2W is said to be P-properly quasi- 
convex if for every y1,y2 E Y, w1 E 4(yl), w2 E +(y2), and X E (0, I), there 
exists w E +(Xyl + (1 - X)y2) such that either w I p  wl or w I p  w2. 
Indeed, let M, := {y E Y : @(x, y) c P) and X E (0, I), yl E M,, y2 E M,. 
Then for i = 1,2 there exist zi E @(x, yi), while zi # P. Since @(x, y) is P- 
properly quasi-convex in y, there exists a z E @(x, Xyl + (1 - X)y2) such that 
either z I p  zl or z I p  z2. If we can show z # P, then @(x, Xyl + (1 -X)y2) $ P 
implying Xyl + (1 - X)y2 E M,, so that M, is convex. To this end, suppose 
otherwise z E P. If z I p  zl holds, then this together with z E P imply 
zl = (zl - z) + z E P+ P P which is a contradiction. This establishes z # P. 
Similarly z # P if z I p  22. Hence M, is convex and condition (ii) of Theorem 
4.1 is satisfied.

Abstract: 
We show that many equilibrium problems fulfill a common law 
expressed by a set of complementarity conditions and that the equilibrium so- 
lution is obtained as a solution to a Variational Inequality. In particular we 
show that various models of elastoplastic torsion are included in the framework 
above. 
Key words: Variational inequality, elastoplastic torsion, quasi-relative interior, 
Lagrange multipliers.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Many equilibrium problems arising from various fields of science may be ex- 
pressed, under general conditions, in a unified way: 
where B and C are suitable operators defined in a suitable functional class 
S. For example, many important problems of Mathematical Phisic follow the 
structure: 
[C(u)u - F(u, Au)] [A(u, Au) - $1 = 0 
A(% Au) 5 $ 
u 2 4  
u = + o n d R .  
A particular case is considered in section 5.4 of the book Troianiello (1987), 
where the following problem is considered: 
The kind of EQUILIBRIUM described by the structure (1.1) is, in general, 
different from the one obtained by minimizing of a cost functional or of an 
energy integral. Moreover, the structure (1.1) leads, in general, to a VARIA- 
TIONAL INEQUALITY on a convex, closed subset of S (usually called K). 
This happens, for example, for: unilateral problems in continuum mechan- 
ics (the celebrated Signorini problem) the obstacle problem, the discrete and 
continuum traffic equilibrium problem, the spatial price problem, the finan- 
cial problem, the Walras problem, see Idone (2003), Maugeri (2001), Maugeri 
(1998). 
The equilibrium given by the structure (1.1) may be considered as an equilib- 
rium from a "local point of view". It is different, in general, from the one, which 
we call "global", obtained by minimizing the usual functionals, and represents 
a complementary aspect which makes clear unknown features of equilibrium 
problems. The reason for which the past decades have witnessed an excep- 
tional interest in the equilibrium problems of the type (1.1) rests on the fact 

EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEMS 
521 
that the Variational Inequality theory which in general expresses the equilib- 
rium conditions (1 .I), provides a powerful methodology, that in these last years 
has been improved by studying the connections with the Separation Theory, 
Gap Functions, the Lagrangean Theory and Duality and many related compu- 
tational procedures. 
In the present paper we show that various models of elasto-plastic torsion 
satisfy the structure (1.1) and that the equilibrium conditions (1.1) can be 
expressed in terms of a Variational Inequality.

A MODEL OF ELASTIC-PLASTIC TORSION 
Let R be an open bounded Lipschitz domain with its boundary I' = dR; for 
the sake of simplicity, we confine ourselves to the case R c R2. 
Let K be the closed convex non empty subset of HA (52): 
Then for each f E L2(R) the V.I. 
where: 
is the usual sesquilinear form with: 
aij E Lw(R), bi E L2+', E > 0 
X 2 
in such a way that: 

522 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
admits a unique solution. 
Let u be the unique solution to the V.I. and let us consider the Lagrangean 
Function: 
where: 
(a, X i ,  X 2 )  E C* = { ( a ,  X i ,  X 2 )  : a, X i ,  X2 E L ~ ( R ) ,  
a, X i ,  A2 2 0 a. e. in 0 ) .  
Taking into account that the convex K satisfies the constraint qualification 
condition introduced in Borwein et al. (1991), namely the "quasi-relative in- 
terior of K is non empty", which replaces the standard Slater condition in the 
infinite dimensional case, following Daniele (1999) (see also Maugeri (1998)), it 
is possible to show the following Lemma: 
- - 
Lemma 2.1 There exist (P, X I ,  X 2 )  E C* such that 
- - 
Vv E HA (R), V(P, X I ,  X z )  E C*. Moreover, L(u,F, X I ,  X2) = 0. 
Now let us denote by L u  the operator defined by the relationship: 
(Lu, v) = a(., 
v) - 
f vdx Vv E H,$ (0). 
J, 
By means of Lemma 2.1, we can prove the following result:

Taking into account (2.7), we find that the solution to the Variational In- 
equality (2.2) verifies the conditions (2.6):

This is a particular case of the general scheme (1.1). 
In the paper Brkzis et al. (1977) the author claims for the convenience to 
study problems of the general scheme (1.1) in a convex R in which an upper 
bound for the gradient of u is given: 
This case is studied in paper Idone et al. (2002), in which a similar charac- 
terization of (1.1) is proved. In particular the convex set

introduced by Minty is defined. Descent methods for the minimization of the 
gap functions are analysed in order to develop exact and inexact line-search 
algorithms for solving strictly and strongly monotone variational inequalities, 
respectively.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The gap function approach for Variational Inequalities (for short, VI) has al- 
lowed to develop a wide class of descent methods for solving the classic V I  
defined by the following problem: 
find y* E K s.t. (F(y*), x - y*) 2 0, 
VX E K, 
(VI) 
where F : lRn - 
lRn, K G lRn and ( a ,  
a )  is the inner product in lRn. 
We recall that a gap function p : lRn - 
lR is a non-negative function on K ,  
such that p(y) = 0 with y E K if and only if y is a solution of VI. Therefore 
solving a V I  is equivalent to the (global) minimization of the gap function on 
K .  
In the last years the efforts of the scholars have been directed to the study 
of differentiable gap functions in order to simplify the computational aspects of 
the problem. See Harker et a1 (1990), for a survey on the theory and algorithms 
developed for VI. 
The problem of defining a continuously differentiable gap function was first 
solved by Fukushima (1992) whose approach was generalized by Zhu et a1 
(1994); they proved that 
is a continuously differentiable gap function for V I  under the following condi- 
tions: G(x, y) : lRn x lRn - 
lR, is a non-negative, continuously differentiable, 
strongly convex function on the convex set K with respect to x, such that 
G(y, y) = 0 and V,G(y, y) = 0, 
Vy E K. 
In the particular case where G(x, y) := i ( x  - y, M(x - y)), where M is a sym- 
metric and positive definite matrix of order n, it is recovered the gap function 
introduced by Fukushima (1992). 
Mastroeni (1999) showed that the gap function approach for V I  developed 
by Fukushima (1992), Zhu et a1 (1994), can be extended to the variational 
inequality introduced by Minty (1962): 
find x* E K s.t. (F(y), x* - y) 5 0, Vy E K. 
(VI*) 
The interest in the study of Minty Variational Inequality had, at first, theoret- 
ical reasons, mainly in the analysis of existence results concerning the classic 
VI. 

GAP FUNCTIONS 
531 
In fact, under the hypotheses of continuity and pseudomonotonicity of the 
operator F, VI* is equivalent to V I  (Karamardian (1976)). Recently, John 
(1998) has shown that VI* provides a sufficient condition for the stability of 
equilibrium solutions of autonomous dynamical systems: 
where x = x(t), t 2 0. 
Moreover some algorithmic applications have been developed in the field of 
bundle methods for solving V I  (see e.g. Lemarechal et a1 (1995)). 
In this paper, we will deepen the analysis of descent methods for VI* initi- 
ated by Mastroeni (1999). In particular, we will define an inexact line-search 
algorithm for the minimization of a gap function associated to the problem 
VI*. 
In Section 2 we will recall the main properties of the gap functions related 
to VI*. In Section 3 we will develop an inexact descent method for VI*, in the 
hypothesis of strong monotonicity of the operator F. Section 4 will be devoted 
to a brief outline of the applications of Minty Variational Inequality and to the, 
recently introduced, extension to the vector case (Giannessi (1998)). 
We recall the main notations and definitions that will be used in the sequel. 
A function f : Rn - 
R is said quasi-convex on the convex set K iff: 
Vx1, x2 E K,VX E [0, 11. 
If f is differentiable on K ,  then f is quasi-convex on K iff: 
A function f : K - 
R is said strictly quasi-convex iff strict inequality holds 
in (1.1), for every XI # x2 and every X E (0,l). 
This last definition has been given by Ponstein (1967). Different definitions 
of strict quasi-convexity can be found in the literature ( see e.g. Karamardian 
(1967)): for a deeper analysis on this topic see Avriel et a1 (1981) and references 
therein. 
A strictly quasi-convex function has the following properties (Thomson et 
a1 (1973)): 
(i) f is quasi-convex on K ,  

532 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
(ii) every local minimum point of f on K is also a global minimum point on 
K ,  
(iii) if f attains a global minimum point x* on K then x* is the unique 
minimum point for f on K. 
Let X,Y be metric spaces. A point to set map A : X - 
2Y is upper 
semicontinuous (for short, u.s.c.) according to Berge at a point A* E X if, for 
each open set B > AX*, there exists a neighborhood V of A* such that 
A is lower semicontinuous (for short, 1.s.c.) according to Berge at a point A* E 
X if, for each open set B satisfying B n AX* # 0, there exists a neighborhood 
V of A* such that 
AAnB, VAEV. 
A is called closed at A* E X iff 
A" 
A* E X, yk - 
3 € Y, with 3" 
AAX"~, implies that y E AX*. 
A point to set map is called closed on S C X if it is closed at every point of 
S. 
We will say that the mapping F : lRn - 
lRn is monotone on K iff: 
it is strictly monotone if strict inequality holds Vx # y. 
We will say that the mapping F is pseudomonotone on K iff: 
(F(y), x - y) 2 0 
implies 
(F(x), x - y) 2 0, 
VX,Y E K. 
We will say that F is strongly monotone on K (with modulus p > 0) iff: 
It is known (Ortega et a1 (1970)) that, if F is continuously differentiable on K ,  
then F is strongly monotone on K iff 
where V F  denotes the Jacobian matrix associated to F.

A GAP FUNCTION ASSOCIATED T O  M I N T Y  VARIATIONAL 
INEQUALITY 
In this section, we will briefly recall the main results concerning the gap function 
theory for VI* (Mastroeni (1999)). Following the analysis developed for the 
classic VI, we introduce the gap function associated to VI*. 
Definition 2.1 Let K 5 lRn. The function p : lRn - 
lR is a gap function 
for VI* iff: 
4 P(Y) 2 0, 
VY E K; 
ii) p(y) = 0 and y E K i f f y  is a solution for VI*. 
By means of a suitable regularization of the variational inequality, it is pos- 
sible to define a continuously differentiable gap function for VI* (Mastroeni 
(1999)). Let H(x, y) : lRn x lRn - 
R be a non-negative, differentiable func- 
tion, such that 
H(x,x) = 0, Vx E K; 
(2.1) 
Proposition 2.1 Let K be a convex set in lRn. Suppose that H : lRn x lRn - 
lR, is a non negative, differentiable function on K that fulfils (2.1) and (2.2) 
and F : lRn - 
lRn is a differentiable and pseudomonotone operator on K .  
Then 
is a gap function for VI* 
Proof: We observe that h(x) 2 0, Qx E K. Suppose that h(x*) = 0 with 
x* E K. This is equivalent to say that x* is a global minimum point of the 
problem 
min[(F(y), Y - x*) + H b * ,  y)l. 
Y E K  
The convexity of K implies that x* is a solution of the variational inequality 
(VY[q(x*, 
x*) + H(x*,x*)], Y - x*) 2 0, Qy E K, 

534 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
where q(x, y) := (F(y), y - x). From (2.2) we obtain 
Since Vyq(x,y) = F(y) + VF(y)(y - x) then Vyq(x*,x*) = F(x*), which 
implies that x* is a solution of V I .  By the pseudomonotonicity of F, we obtain 
that x* is also a solution of VI*. 
Now suppose that x* is a solution of VI*. Since H(x, y) is non negative, we 
have that 
(F(Y), 
Y - x*) + H(x*, Y )  > 0, YY E K ,  
which is equivalent to the condition 
Since h(x) 2 0, VX E K ,  we obtain 
h(x*) = min max[(F(y), 
x - y) - H(x, y)] = 0. 
xEK yEK 
0 
Let us consider the differentiability properties of the function h(x). 
Proposition 2.2 Let K be a nonempty compact convex set in Rn. 
Suppose 
that F is continuous on an open set A > K ,  H : Rn 
x Rn --+ 
R is continuously 
differentiable on A x A and the function +(x, y) := (F(y), y - x) + H(x, y) 
is strictly quasi convex with respect to y, 'dx E K ,  then h(x) is continuously 
differentiable on K and its gradient is given by 
where y ( x )  is the solution of the problem m i n , ~ ~  
+(x, 3). 
Proof: We observe that 
h(x) = - inf +(x, y) 
YEK 
Since +(x, y) is strictly quasi convex with respect to y then there exists a 
unique minimum point y(x) of the problem (2.3) . Applying Theorem 4.3.3 of 
Bank et a1 (1983) (see the Appendix), we obtain that y(x) is U.S.C. according 

GAP FUNCTIONS 
535 
to Berge at x and, being y(x) single-valued, it follows that y(x) is continuous 
at x. 
Since F is continuous and H is continuously differentiable then Vx4 is con- 
tinuous. Therefore, from theorem 1.7 Chapter 4 of Auslender (1976) (see the 
Appendix), taking into account that (2.3) has a unique minimum point, it 
follows that h is differentiable in the sense of Gateaux at x and 
From the continuity of F, y(x) and VxH, it follows that hl(x) is continuous at 
x so that h is continuously differentiable and 
3 
EXACT AND INEXACT DESCENT METHODS 
In the previous section we have shown, that under suitable assumptions on the 
operator F and the function H, the gap function associated to the variational 
inequality VI* : 
is continuously differentiable on K. 
This considerable property allows us to define descent direction methods for 
solving the problem 
min h(x) . 
x EK 
After recalling an exact descent method proposed by Mastroeni (1999), we will 
analyse an inexact line search method. We will assume that 
1. K is a nonempty compact and convex set in lRn; 
2. +(x, y) := (F(y), y - x) + H(x, y) is strictly quasi convex with respect to 
y, Vx E K ;  
3. F is a continuously differentiable operator on an open set A > K; 
4. H(x, y) : Rn 
x Rn - 
R is a non negative function on K, which is 
continuously differentiable on A x A. Moreover, we suppose that it fulfils 

536 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
conditions (2.1) and (2.2) and the further assumption: 
Remark 3.1 The hypothesis 4 is fulfilled by the function H(x, y) := %(M(x- 
y), x - y) where M is a symmetric matrix of order n. With this choice of the 
function H, the hypothesis 2 is fulfilled when (F(y), y-x) is convex with respect 
to y, Vx E K ,  and M is positive definite; for example when F(y) = Cy+b where 
C is a positive semidefinite matrix of order n and b E lRn. A characterization 
of strict quasi convexity, in the differentiable case, is given in Theorem 3.26 of 
Avriel et a1 (1981). 
In order to obtain a function H which fulfils (2.1),(2.2) and the condition 
(3.2), as noted by Yamashita et a1 (1997), it must necessarily be 
where $J : lRn - 
lR is nonnegative, continuously differentiable and such that 
$J(O) = 0. 
We recall that, from Proposition 2.2, h is a continuously differentiable function 
and Vh(x) = F(y(x)) -V,H(x, y(x)), where y(x) is the solution of the problem 
Lemma 3.1 Suppose that the hypotheses 1-4 hold and, furthermore, VF(y) is 
a positive definite matrix, Vy E K. Let g(x) be the solution of P(x). Then x* 
is a solution of VI* @x* = y(x*). 
Proof: Since VF(y) is a positive definite matrix, Vy E K ,  and F is con- 
tinuously differentiable, then F is a strictly monotone operator (Ortega et a1 
(1970), Theorem 5.4.3). Therefore x* is a solution of VI* iff 
0 = h(x*) = - min +(x*, y) 
YEK 
and, by the uniqueness of the solution, iff y(x*) = x*. 
0 
Next result proves that y(x) - x provides a descent direction for h at the 
point x, when x # x*. 

GAP FUNCTIONS 
537 
Proposition 3.1 Suppose that the hypotheses 1-4 hold and F is strongly monotone 
on K (with modulus p > 0). Let y(x) be the solution of the problem P(x) and 
d(x) := y(x) - x. Then 
Proof: Since K is a convex set y(x) fulfils the condition 
that is, putting q(x, y) := (F(y), y - x), 
In particular for z := x we obtain 
and the proposition is proved. 
Remark 3.2 If we replace the hypothesis of strong monotonicity of the op- 
erator F, with the one of strict monotonicity, we obtain the weaker descent 
condition: 
(Vh(x), 4x1) < 0, 
provided that y(x) # x. 
The following exact line search algorithm has been proposed by Mastroeni 
(1999): 
Algorithm 1 
Step 1. Let xo E K, E be a tolerance factor and k = 0. If h(xo) = 0, then 
STOP, otherwise go to step 2. 

538 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
Step 2. Let dk := y(xk) - xk. 
Step 3. Let tk E [O,1] be the solution of the problem 
min{h(xk + tdk) : 0 I t I 1); 
(3-4) 
put Xk+1 = Xk -b tkdk. 
If 11xk+1 - xkll < E, then STOP, otherwise let k = k + 1 and go to step 2. 
The following convergence result holds (Mastroeni (1999)): 
Theorem 3.1 Suppose that the hypotheses 1-4 hold and VF(y) is positive def- 
inite, Vy E K .  Then, for any xo E K the sequence {xk) defined by Algorithm 1 
belongs to the set K and converges to the solution of the variational inequality 
VI*. 
Proof: Since VF(y) is positive definite Vy E K ,  and F is continuously differ- 
entiable then F is a strictly monotone operator (Ortega et a1 (1970), Theorem 
5.4.3) and therefore both problems VI and VI* have the same unique solution. 
The convexity of K implies that the sequence {xk) C K since tr, E [O,l]. It 
is proved in the Proposition 2.2 that the function y(x) is continuous, which 
implies the continuity of d(x). It is known (see e.g. Minoux (1986), Theorem 
3.1) that the map 
is closed whenever h is a continuous function. 
Therefore the algorithmic map xk+l = U(xk,d(xk)) is closed, (see e.g. 
Minoux (1986), Proposition 1.3). Zangwill's convergence theorem (Zangwill 
(1969)) (see the Appendix) implies that any accumulation point of the sequence 
{xk) is a solution of VI*. Since VI* has a unique solution, the sequence {xk} 
converges to the solution of VI*. 
0 
Algorithm 1 is based on an exact line search rule: it is possible to consider 
the inexact version of the previous method. 
Algorithm 2 
Step 1. Let xo be a feasible point, E be a tolerance factor and P, (T parameters 
in the open interval (0,l). Let k = 0. 

GAP FUNCTIONS 
539 
Step 2. If h(xk) = 0, then STOP, otherwise go to step 3. 
Step 3. Let dk := y(xk) - xk. Select the smallest nonnegative integer m such 
that 
h(xk) - h(xk + p m d k )  2 apmIldkl12, 
set ak = pm and xk+l = xk + akdk. 
If Ilxk+l - xkII < E ,  then STOP, otherwise let k = k + 1 and go to step 2. 
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that the hypotheses 1-4 hold, F is a strongly monotone 
operator on K with modulus p, a < p/2, and { x k )  is the sequence defined in 
the Algorithm 2. Then, for any xo E K, the sequence {xk) belongs to the set 
K and converges to the solution of the variational inequality VI*. 
Proof: The convexity of K implies that the sequence {xk) C K, since ak E 
[O, 11. The compactness of K ensures that {xk) has at least one accumulation 
point. Let { Z k )  be any convergent subsequence of {xk) and x* be its limit 
point. 
We will prove that y(x*) = x* so that, by Lemma 3.1, x* is the solution of 
VI*. 
Since y(x) is continuous (see the proof of Proposition 2.2) it follows that d(x) 
is continuous; therefore we obtain that d(3k) ---t d(x*) =: d* and h(Zk) - 
h(x*) =: h*. By the line search rule we have 
for a suitable subsequence {&) C {ak). 
Let us prove the relation (3.5). We observe that, by the line search rule, the 
sequence {h(xk)) is strictly decreasing. Let k E N and xl;: := Z k ,  for some 
iE E N; 
we have 
Putting & := ai, we obtain (3.5). Therefore, 
If Gk > pmO > 0, for some mo, 'dk > k E N, then Ild(Zk)ll - 
0 SO that 
y (x*) = x* .

Otherwise suppose that there exists a subsequence { a k ~ )  G { C k )  such that 
a k l  - 
0. By the line search rule we have that 
where &I

Taking the limit in (3.6) for k + oo, since - 
0 and h is continuously 
differentiable, we obtain 
-(Vh(x*), d*) 5 ~lld*11~. 
(3.7) 
Recalling Proposition 3.1, we have also 
-(Vh(x*),d*) 2 p(ld*1I2. 
Since o < $, it must be Ild*ll = 0, which implies y(x*) = x*.

SOME APPLICATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF MINTY 
VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY 
Besides the already mentioned equivalence with the classic VI, Minty varia- 
tional inequality enjoys some peculiar properties that justify the interest in the 
development of the analysis. We will briefly recall some applications in the 
field of optimization problems and in the theory of dynamical systems. Finally 
we will outline the recently introduced extension to the vector case (Giannessi 
(1998)). 
Consider the problem 
min f(x), s.t. X E K ,  
(4.1) 
where f : Rn - 
R is a continuously differentiable function on the convex set 
K. 
The following statement has been proved by Komlosi (1999). 
Theorem 4.1 Let F := Vf. If x* is a solution of VI* then x* is a global 
minimum point for (4.1). 
In some particular cases, the previous result leads to an alternative character- 
ization of a global minimum point of (4.1). 

GAP FUNCTIONS 
541 
Corollary 4.1 Let F := V f  and suppose that f is a quasi-convex function on 
K. Then x* is a solution of VI* i f  and only if it is a global minimum point for 
(4.1). 
Proof: Suppose that x* is a global minimum point of (4.1). By the equivalent 
characterization (1.2) of the quasi-convexity, in the differentiable case, it follows 
that x* is a solution of VI*. The converse implication follows from Theorem 
4.1. 
0 
A further interesting application can be found in the field of autonomous 
dynamical systems: 
dx - + F(x) = 0, x E K, 
dt 
(DS) 
where x = x(t), t 2 0. 
Suppose that V F  is continuous on the set 
R := { x  E K : IIxII < A), 
where A > 0, so that there exists a unique solution x(t) of DS with x(to) = so. 
Consider an equilibrium point x* E R, which fulfils the relation F(x*) = 0. It 
is obvious that 
x(t) = x*, vt )t 0, x(to) = x*, 
is a solution for DS. The following definition clarifies the concept of stability 
of the previous solution. 
Definition 4.1 The equilibrium point x* is said stable for DS iJ for every 
0 < E < A, there exists 0 < S I 
E such that i f  llxo -x*II I 6, then Ilx(t) -x* 1 1  < 
E, Vt 2 0, where x(t) is the solution of DS with the initial condition x(to) = xo. 
Minty Variational Inequality provides a sufficient condition for the equilibrium 
point x* to be stable.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
We have shown that the gap function theory developed for the classic VI, intro- 
duced by Stampacchia, can be extended, under further suitable assumptions, to 
the Minty Variational Inequality. These extensions are concerned not only with 
the theoretical point of view, but also with the algorithmic one: under strict or 
strong monotonicity assumptions on the operator F ,  exact or inexact descent 
methods, respectively, can be defined for VI* following the line developed for 
VI. 
It would be of interest to analyse the relationships between the class of gap 
functions associated to V I  and the one associated to VI* in the hypothesis of 
pseudomonotonicity of the operator F, which guarantees the equivalence of the 
two problems. This might allow to define a resolution method, based on the 
simultaneous use of both gap functions related to V I  and VI*.

proofs of the results stated in the present paper. 

GAP FUNCTIONS

Theorem 6.1 (Bank et a1 (1983)) is concerned with the continuity of the opti- 
mal solution map of a parametric optimization problem. Theorem 6.2 (Auslen- 
der (1976)) is a generalization of well-known results on directional differentia- 
bility of extremal-value functions. Theorem 6.3 is the Zangwill convergence 
theorem for a general algorithm formalized under the form of a multifunction. 
Consider the following parametric optimization problem: 
v(x) := inf {f (x, y) s.t. y E M(x)}, 
where f : A x Y - 
R, M : A - 
2Y, Y G Rn and A is a metric space. 
Let $ : A - 
2Y be the optimal set mapping 
Theorem 6.1 ( Bank et a1 (1983), Theorem 4.3.3 ) Let Y := Rn and xO E A. 
Suppose that the following condition are fulfilled: 
1. $(xO) is non-empty and bounded; 
2. f is lower semicontinuous on {xO} x Y and a point yo E $(xO) exists such 
that f is upper semicontinuous at (so, yo); 
3. f (x, -) is quasiconvex on Y for each fixed x E A; 
4. M(x) is a convex set, 'dx E A; 
5. M(xO) is closed and the mapping M is closed and lower semicontinuous, 
according to Berge, at xO. 
Then $ is upper semicontinuous according to Berge at xO 
We observe that, if M(x) = K ,  Vx E A, where K is a nonempty convex and 
compact set in Rn, then the assumptions 1,4 and 5, of Theorem 6.1, are clearly 
fulfilled and it is possible to replace the assumption Y := Rn with Y := K. 
Next result is well-known and can be found in many generalized versions: 
we report the statement of Auslender (1976). We recall that a function h : 
RP - 
R is said to be "directionally differentiable" at the point x* E RP in 
the direction d, iff there exists finite: 
lim h(x* + td) - h(x*) =: hl(x*; d). 
t*0+ 
t 

544 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
If there exists z* E RP suet that hl(x*, d) = (z*, d) then h is said to be differ- 
entiable in the sense of Gateaux at x*, and z* is denoted by ht(x*). 
Theorem 6.2 (Auslender (1976), Theorem 1.7, Chapter 4) Let 
v(x) := inf f (x, y ) ,  
Y E Y  
where f : RP XY - 
R. Suppose that 
1. f is continuous on RP x Y ;  
2. V ,  f exists and is continuous on R x Y ,  where R is an open set in IRP; 
3. Y is a closed set in Rn; 
4. For every x E Rp, @(x) := { y  E Y : f (x, y) = v(x)) is nonempty and 
there exists a neighbourhood V ( x )  ofx, such that UZEV(,)+(z) is bounded. 
Then, for every x E R, we have: 
vt(x;d) = inf (V,f(x,y),d). 
YE+(.) 
Moreover, i f  for a point x* E R, @(x*) contains exactly one element y(x*), then 
v is differentiable, in the sense of Gateaux, at x* and 
vt(x*) = Vz f (x*, y(x*)). 
We observe that, when Y is a nonempty compact set, then the assumptions 
3 and 4, of Theorem 6.2, are obviously fulfilled. The reader can also refer 
to Hogan (1973) and references therein for similar versions of the previous 
theorem. 
Finally, we recall the statement of Zangwill Convergence Theorem as re- 
ported in Minoux (1986). Given an optimization problem P defined on X g 
Rn, let M be the set of the points of X that fulfil a suitable necessary opti- 
mality condition. Suppose that, in order to solve P ,  it is used an algorithm 
represented by a point to set map A : X - 
2 X .  
Definition 6.1 We say that z : X - 
R is a descent function (related to the 
algorithm A) i f  it is continuous and has the following properties: 
1. x $ M implies z(y) < z(x) Vy E A(x), 
2. x E M implies z(y) < Z ( X )  Vy E A(x).

Theorem 6.3 ( Zangwill (1969)) Let P be an optimization problem on X and 
M be the set of the points of X that fulfil a certain necessary optimality condi- 
tion. 
Let A : X - 
2X be the algorithmic point to set mapping and consider a 
sequence {xk} generated by the algorithm, i.e. satisfying xk+l E A(xk). 
Suppose that the following three conditions hold: 
1. Every point xk is contained in a compact set K C X ;  
2. There exists a descent function z; 
3. The point to set map A is closed on X \ M and Vx E X \ M, A(x) # 8. 
Then, for every x which is the limit of a convergent subsequence of {x", 
we 
have that x E M.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Consider the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP(F)), 
where we assume that F : lRn + lRn is a continuously differentiable Po 
function. We recall that F is a Po function if for any x # y in Rn 
Note that the class of Po functions includes the class of monotone functions. 
Applications of N C P  can be found in many important fields such as mathe- 
matical programming, economics, engineering and mechanics (see, e.g.,Cottle 
et a1 (1992); Harker and Pang (1990)). 
There exist several methods for the solution of the complementarity problem. 
In this paper are considered regularization methods, which are designed to 
handle ill-posed problems. Very roughly speaking, an ill-posed problem may 
be difficult to solve since small errors in the computations can lead to a totally 
wrong solution. 
For the class of the Po functions, Facchinei and Kanzow (1999) considered the 
Tikhonov-regularization, this scheme consist of solving a sequence of comple- 
mentarity problems NCP(Fk), where Fk(x) := F(x) + ckx and ck is a positive 
parameter converging to 0, and Yamashita et a1 (1999), considered the proximal 
point algorithm, proposed by Martinet (1970) and further studied by Rockafel- 
lar (1976). For the NCP(F), given the current point xk, the proximal point 
algorithm produces the next iterate by approximately solving the subproblem 
NCP(Fk), where Fk(x) := F(x) + ck(x - x" and ck is a positive parameter 
that does not necessary converge to 0. In the case above, if F is a Po function, 
then Fk is a P function, that is, for any x, y E Rn 
with x # y, 
Therefore the subproblem NCP(Fk) is better tractable than NCP(F), since 
if F is a P function, then NCP(F) has at most one solution. 
In this paper, we consider a variable proximal regularization algorithm. 
Given the current point xk > 0, the variable proximal regularization algorithm 
produces the next iterate by approximately solving the subproblem NCP(F", 
where 
k 
F~(x) := F(x) + c~(x"-'(x - x ),

k -r 
(xk)-' is defined by (x")-~ 
= di~g{(x:)-~, 
(xn) ), r 2 1 and ck is a 
positive parameter. 
Now, some words about our motivation. It comes from the application of 
some tools of Riemannian geometry to the continuous optimization. This is 
object of research by many authors, as can be seen in Bayer and Lagarias 
(1989); Bayer and Lagarias (1989a); Cruz Neto, Lima and Oliveira (1998); Fer- 
reira and Oliveira (1998); Ferreira and Oliveira (2002); Gabay (1982); Kar- 
markar (1990); Nesterov and Todd (2002); Rapcs&k (1997); Udriste (1994), 
and in the bibliography therein. One of the trends is given in Cruz Neto 
and OLiveira (1995), where it is explored the idea that associates Riemannian 
metrics and descent directions. Specifically, they start from the equivalence 
property between a metric dependent gradient and the generator descent direc- 
tion (also metric dependent). The authors had unified a large variety of primal 
methods, seen as gradient ones, and obtained other classes. That includes pri- 
mal interior point methods such as Dikin (1967), Karmarkar (1984), and the 
Eggermont multiplicative algorithm, by Eggermont (1990). A general theory 
for such gradient methods can be seen in Cruz Neto, Lima and Oliveira (1998). 
Particularly, in Cruz Neto and OLiveira (1995), they considered the positive 
orthant R+-tn as a manifold, associated with a class of metrics generated by 
the Hessian of some separable functions p(x) = Cy=lpi(~i), pi : R++ -+ R, 
pi(xi) > 0, for i = 1,2, ..., n. Clearly, the functions such that pi = x i r ,  
i = 1,2, ..., n, and r 2 1, is contained in that class. For r = 1, r = 2, and r = 3, 
they correspond, respectively, to the Hessian of Eggermont multiplicative, log 
and Fiacco- McCormick barriers. Those metrics, denoted by X-r, lead to pro- 
jective (affine) interior point methods in Pinto, Oliveira and Cruz Neto (2002), 
and proximal interior point algorithms in Oliveira and Oliveira (2002). Here, 
we exploit those ideas in a context of NCP. Observe that in the case where 
NCP is equivalent to the optimality conditions of some linear or nonlinear pro- 
gramming problem, our method can be seen as an infeasible interior point class 
of algorithms. 
By using the Mountain Pass Theorem, we show that the method converges 
globally if F is a Po function and the solution set of NCP(F) is nonempty and 
bounded. Facchinei (1998) give necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure 
that the solution set of NCP(F) is bounded.

OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some results which 
will be used in the following sections. In section 3, we prove that the regularized 
problem has a unique solution. In Section 4, we describe the proposed algorithm 
and we show its convergence properties.

PRELIMINARIES 
In this section we review some basic definitions and properties which will be 
used in the subsequent analysis. 
We first restate the basic definition. 
Definition 2.1 A matrix M E Rnxn is called 
1. a Po-matrix if, for every x E Rn with x # 0, there is an index i = i(x) 
with 
X i  # 0 and x ~ [ M x ] ~  
2 0; 
2. a P-matrix i;f, for every x E IRn with x # 0, it holds that 
The following proposition summarizes some useful properties that play an 
important role in the analysis of the uniqueness of solution of the regularized 
problems N C P ( F ~ ) .  
Proposition 2.1 Let F be function from IRn in IRn. 
(a) (More' and Rheinboldt (1973), Theorem 5.8) If F is a Po function, then 
the Jacobian matrix, Ft(x), is a Po-matrix for every x E R n ;  
(b) (More' and Rheinboldt (1973), Theorem 5.2) If F'(x) is a P-matrix for 
every x E IRn, then F is a P function; 
(c) (More' (74), Theorem 2.3) If F is a P function, then N C P ( F )  has at most 
one solution. 
The following theorem is a version of the mountain pass theorem (see, Palais 
and Terng (1988)), that will be used to establish a global convergence theorem 
for the proposed algorithm.

Theorem 2.1 Let f : lRn - 
IR be continuously diflerentiable and coercive. 
Let S c lRn be a nonempty and compact set and define m to be least value of 
f on the (compact) boundary of S: 
m := min f ( x ) .  
~ E a s  
Assume further that there are two points a E S and b 6 S such that f (a) < m 
and f (b) < m. Then there exists a points c E lRn such that V f  (c) = 0 and 
f ( c )  L m.

EXISTENCE OF REGULARIZED SOLUTIONS 
In this section, we prove that the regularized problem N C P ( F ~ )  has a unique 
solution for every k. For this, we consider the equivalent reformulation of 
N C P ( F )  using the Fischer- Burmeister function (see, Fischer (1992)), cp : 
IR2 - 
lR, defined by 
p(a, b) = JW - a - b. 
The most fundamental property of this function is that 
p(a, b) = 0 +=+ a 2 0, b 2 0 and ab= 0. 
Using this function, we obtain the following system of equations equivalent to 
With this operator, we define a merit fuction GJ : Rn - 
lR through 
1 
GJ(x) = 511wl12. 
For the regularized problem, we define the corresponding operator and the 
corresponding merit function similarly as 
and 

554 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
We summarize some useful properties of those functions in the following result 
(see, Facchinei and Kanzow (1999)). 
Proposition 3.1 The following statements hold: 
1. x* E lRn solves N C P ( F )  i f  and only if x* solves the nonlinear system of 
equations Q ( X )  = 0. 
2. The merit function 
is continuosly differentiable on the whole space Cn 
. 
3. If F is a Po function, then every stationary point of Q, is a solution of 
N C P ( F ) .  
The proof of the following lemma can be found in Kanzow (1996). 
Lemma 3.1 Let {ak}, {bk} C C be any two sequences such that ak,bk - 
+oo 
or ak - 
-oo or bk - 
--o Then Ip(ak, bk)l - 
+m. 
The following proposition plays an important role in proving the existence 
of solution of the regularized problems N C P ( F ~ ) .  
Proposition 3.2 Suppose that F is a Po function. Then the merit function 
ak is coercive for every k, i. e., 
lim a k ( x )  = +oo. 
llxll--- 
Proof: Suppose by contradiction that there exists an unbounded sequence 
{zl) such that { ~ ~ ( z ' ) )  
is bounded. Since the sequence {zL} is unbounded, the 
index set 
J:= { j  E {l,...,n}l{zi) is unbounded}, 
is nonempty. Subsequencing if necessary, we can assume without loss of gen- 
erality that lzil --+ 
oo for all j E J. Therefore, we consider two possible 
cases. 
Case 1. zj - 
oo Let {yl) denotes the bounded sequence defined through 
zj ifj $ J. 

A NEW CLASS OF PROXIMAL ALGORITHMS 
555 
jFrom the definition of {yl) and the assumption that F is a Po function, 
we get 
0 5 
max (zf - y f ) [ ~ i ( z ' )  
- ~ i ( ~ ' ) ]  
lsisn 
= maxzf [ ~ i  
(zl) - ~i (yl)] 
i € J  
= 2;. [

j
 
(zl) - Fj (yl)], 
where j is one of the indices for which the max is attained, that is in- 
dependent of I. Since {yl) is bounded, by continuity of Fj it follows 
that { ~ j ( y ' ) )  
is bounded. Therefore, zj [
~
j
 
( z l )  - Fj(yl)] 2 0 implies 
that { ~ ~ ( z ' ) )  
does not tend to -m. This, in turn, implies zj ---t oo e 
Fj(zl) + ~ ~ ( x $ ) - ~ ( z j  
- x$) --+ m. By Lemma 3.1 we have that 
contradicting the boudedness of the sequence {@(zl)). 
Case 2. zi -+ -oo We have immediately from Lemma 3.1 that 
contradicting the boundedness of the sequence { ~ ~ ( z ' ) ) .  
We are now in position to prove the following existence and uniqueness result. 
Theorem 3.1 If F is a Po function, then the NCP(F" has a unique solution 
for every k. 
Proof: Since F1(x) is a Po-matrix, ck > 0 and (X")-T is positive definite, by 
the definition of F%e 
have that (Fk)l(x) = F1(x) + ck(Xk)-T is a P-matrix. 
Therefore, by Proposition 2.1 (b)it follows that Fk is a P function. This in 
turn implies that NCP(Fk) has at most one solution, due to the Proposition 
2.1 (c). 
We prove now the existence of solution. From the Proposition 3.2 @ i s  
coercive. Since the function Qk is continuos, it attains a global minimum. This, 

556 
OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL WITH APPLICATIONS 
in turn, implies, also using Proposition 3.1, item 2, that the global minimum 
is a stationary point of @. However, @ i s  a 
P function; in particular, 9pk itself is a Po function, so that the global mini- 
mum must be a solution of NCP(Fk), due to Proposition 3.1, item 3. 
4 
ALGORITHM AND CONVERGENCE 
In this section we propose a variable metric proximal algorithm and we show 
convergence properties. 
Algorithm 4.1 Step 0: Choose co > 0, So E (0,l) and x0 E R:+. 
Set 
k := 0. 
Step 1: Given ck > 0, Sk E (0,l) and x" 
RlR"++, 
obtain xk+l E R:+ 
such 
that 9pk(xk+l)i I Sk. 
Step 2: Choose ck+l E (0, ck) and 6k+l E (0, Sk). Set k := k + 1, and go to 
Step 1. 
The Algorithm 4.1 is well defined, since by Theorem 3.1 the N C P ( F 9  has 
a unique solution, therefore, as @k is continuous, given dk > 0, there exists 
xW1 E R:+, 
in a neigborhood of the unique solution of the NCP(F~), such 
that @(x"l)* 
5 Sk. 
Now, we give conditions under which the algorithm converges globally to a 
solution of NCP(F). The sequence {ck) satisfies the following conditions: 
(A) ck (xk))-' (xM1 - xk) - 
0 if {xk) is bounded; 
(B) c ~ ( x ~ ) ~  - 
0 if {xk) is unbounded and s 1 0. 
Remark 4.1 In Oliveira and Oliveira (2002), they introduce a family of vari- 
able metric interior-proximal methods which considering F = V f and assuming 
that F is a Lipschtz continuous monotone function, they showed that hold (A). 

A NEW CLASS OF PROXIMAL ALGORITHMS 
557 
Remark 4.2 The conditions (A) and (B) can be ver$ed if we define ck = 
) for 4 E (0,1). In this case ck + 0. 
Remark 4.3 When s = 0 in (B), then ck + 0. 
Under above conditions, we have the following lemma. 
Lemma 4.1 Suppose that condition (B) holds. Let S C lRn be an arbitrary 
compact set. If {xk} zs unbounded, then for any e > 0, there exists a sujjiciently 
large ko such that for all k 2 ko 
I@"x) - @(x)l 5 e for all x E S. 
Proof: By definition of Fk we have that for any x E S 
where e = (1,. . . , l)T E lRn. Therefore by condition (B), and the fact that S 
is compact we have I~F"x) - F(x)ll --+ 0, since r 2 1 e x E S. Now, for any 
a,b,c E R we have that 
Applying the result above with a = xi, b = Fi(x) and c = c~(x:)-"(x~ - x:) 
we have that Icp(xi, F!(x)) 
- cp(xi, F~(x))[ 5 21~k(xP)-~(xi - x:)I 
--+ 0. 
Since S is compact, Fk converges uniformly to F in S; furthermore, cp, F 
and F%re continuous, so we have that for all i 
The following result is our main convergence theorem for the Algorithm 4.1.

Theorem 4.1 Suppose that F is a Po function and assume that the solution

If x* E S*, then we have @(x*) = 0. Let 
Applying Lemma 4.1 with e := $, there exists some ko such that for all k 2 ko 
and 
3a 
m := min@"x) > -. 
X E ~ S  
4 
Since ak(xk+') < 6; by Step 1 of Algorithm 4.1, there exists some kl such 
that for all k 2 kl, 
ak(xk+l) < ;, 
since dk - 
0 by our asumption. 
Now, consider a fixed index k 2 max{ko, kl} with k E K and set a = x* and 
b = xk+l, we have from Theorem 2.1 that there exists a vector c E lRn such 
that 
3a 
vak(c) = 0 and ~ ~ ( c )  
2 rn 2 - > 0.

Therefore c is a stationary point of ak, which does not minimize ak globally. 
However this contradicts Proposition 3.1, item 3. Hence {x" 
is bounded. 
Next, we show that any accumulation point of {xk} is a solution of NCP(F). 
Since {x" 
is bounded, we have IIFk(xk+l) - ~(x"l)ll - 
0 by condition 
(A), and hence I@"xwl) - (a(x"')l - 
0. By Step 1 of algorithm and the 
assumption that 6k --+ 0, we have ak(xk+l) - 
0 . Consequently it holds 
that @(xwl) - 
0, which means that every accumulation point of the sequence 
{xk} is a solution of NCP(F).

CONCLUSIONS 
We presented a new class of algorithms for NCP, with convergence results for 
Po functions. As we have seen in the introduction, a few papers were produced 
for that class of NCP. As a further working, we are particularly interested 
in the behavior of the algorithm, as depending of the r 2 1 parameter, also, 
when applied to monotone functions. On the other hand, observe that although 
Fischer-Burmeister function (Fischer (1992)), was essential in our theoretical 
analysis, it could be used someother function in step 1 of our algorithm. Now, 
we are working on different choices, in order to get a easier computable ck. As 
a final remark, it is worthwhile to consider the case when the solution set of 
NCP(F) is unbounded.
