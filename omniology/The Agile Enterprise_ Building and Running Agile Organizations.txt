Getting Started
An Agile enterprise has Agile occurring end-to-end and top-to-bottom.
—Mario Moreira
Imagine an enterprise where everyone focuses on the highest customer 
value, an enterprise that methodically yet quickly adapts toward high value 
and cuts the tail of lower-value work.
Imagine a company where employees are trusted to use 100% of their brain 
power to self-organize around the work and think of better ways to work, 
a company where employee satisfaction comes from within the employees 
themselves for a job well done.
Imagine an organization where ideas—from strategies to tasks—are transpar-
ent so everyone knows if their work is aligned with strategy and high-priority 
ideas, an organization where budgeting is given to the highest-value ideas.
Imagine an enterprise where a discovery mindset wins over certainty think-
ing, an enterprise where experimentation with increments and feedback 
helps define the way toward customer value.
Imagine a company where managers are coaches, mentors, and leaders who 
encourage people with inspiration, vision, and trust; a company where there 
is a singular focus on putting the enterprise first instead of individual egos.
Imagine an enterprise where customers embrace the ideas being built because 
they are engaged in the building of the work all along the way, an enterprise 
where customers become your partners providing continuous feedback.

If you can imagine this type of enterprise, then this book can help you real-
ize it. This book provides insightful and pragmatic knowledge and activities 
to help you visualize what an effectively running Agile enterprise looks like. 
You will learn more about the importance of engaging customers and gaining 
their feedback. Fully embrace the importance of engaging employees, ensur-
ing they have ownership and can self-organize around the work. Embrace the 
idea of leading your Agile transformation with education and focusing on the 
behavioral changes prior to the mechanical changes.
Have you realized that there is much more to Agile than following a process? 
Are you yearning to explore an effective culture where the discovery mind-
set brings you closer to customer value? Have you come to the conclusion 
that Agile is about building a holistic enterprise culture that is optimized for 
being agile and delivering customer value?
This book will share many cutting-edge concepts, mindsets, and practices 
to answer these questions. It will help you adapt to the culture, roles, and 
practices that you will need to be a customer-value-driven enterprise. If you 
are committed to customer success and realize that it does take a whole 
enterprise to achieve it, then this is the book for you.
Agile should not be done for the sake of Agile. Instead, Agile helps you 
deliver more value to customers and achieve better business outcomes. This 
is why, every step of the way, every activity should be viewed as how it is 
optimizing for customer success. This book will lead you down this path.
Innovations of This Book
As this book helps you apply Agile values and principles in the form of con-
cepts, mindsets, practices, and techniques across an enterprise to be the 
most effective and successful that you can be, it introduces you to three 
innovations in the way Agile is approached.
The first innovation this book provides you is a holistic top-to-bottom and 
end-to-end view of an Agile enterprise where everyone is engaged. Get 
introduced to the Agile Galaxy in your customer universe shown in Figure 
1-1. It is designed to help you better understand your Agile landscape of 
today and what you want your future to look like. 

The Agile Enterprise

The second innovation this book provides you is the customer-value-driven 
(CVD) enterprise, the CVD framework, and its corresponding engine of cus-
tomer value that emphasizes the importance of customer feedback. An Agile 
CVD framework is a business and delivery system that is driven by customer 
value, where you capture and prioritize ideas based on customer value, con-
tinuously validate customer value throughout with customer feedback, and 
deliver customer value in a timely manner, all for the purpose of optimiz-
ing the delivery of what the customer finds as value. This includes engaging 
employees in the pursuit of customer value.
The third innovation of this book is a packaging of many cutting-edge Agile 
concepts, mindsets, practices, and techniques that it will reveal regarding 
the adoption of Agile throughout an enterprise, from idea to delivery and 
from the team level to the executive level. In a sense, this is the iPod of Agile 
books (in other words, your iAgile) as shown in Figure 1-2. The iPod wasn’t 
innovative because it was yet another mp3 player. Instead it was innovative 
by how it brought together many cutting-edge concepts, technologies, and 
processes that enabled the highest value to the customer. (See Figure 1-2.)

While there are many Agile processes, frameworks, and practices out on the 
market, not all of them may fit perfectly into your environment and cover all 
of your needs. The goal of this book is to provide you with insight into the 
many Agile elements that can be applied in and across the end-to-end and 
top-to-bottom enterprise landscape so that you may more intelligently and 
adaptively determine what works better for your context.
This book is your guide to adapting to an Agile and CVD culture that starts 
the moment an idea gets recognized to the moment it gets delivered and 
only ends when you receive market feedback of what was learned (in other 
words, how successful the idea is).
On the one hand, this book will provide you a vision of where you can go. 
On the other hand, this book is a pragmatic guide to help you through your 
journey. This book is neither exhaustive nor prescriptive, but it will hopefully 
inspire you to think out-of-the-box and beyond the more traditional and 
common Agile elements and processes. The guidelines in this book can be 
applied equally to whether you are just starting your Agile journey or con-
tinuing to improve your Agile universe.
What You Will Learn
This book provides a landscape of options designed to help you consider, 
understand, deploy, and adapt an Agile culture, mindset, methods, and prac-
tices throughout an enterprise, from executives to Agile teams, and everyone 
in between. More importantly, it will help you narrow the gap between what 
the customer really wants and what you deliver. It is not surprising, given the 
mediocre success of many products and services, that those who claim to 
be customer-focused are optimizing less for the customer and more for the 
organization’s bureaucracy, sub-optimizing for a division or personal goals.

What you will learn is that it does take an enterprise from as early as ideation 
through reflection after delivery (left to right) and executives to team (top to 
bottom) to make an Agile value-driven enterprise work.
What you will also learn is many of the latest modern concepts, mindsets, 
practices, and techniques that can help you on your journey so that you can 
run your enterprise in a customer value-driven manner.
This book maps the bottom-to-top and idea-to-delivery ways to operate in 
an enterprise Agile manner and gain the benefits that you desire from an Agile 
transformation. The topics that this book focuses on include the following:

Envisioning a  
Customer-Value- 
Driven 
Enterprise
The hyperfocus of a customer-value-driven enterprise is incrementally 
learning what the customer wants and delivering it.
—Mario Moreira
What is a customer-value-driven enterprise? It is a company that optimizes 
for what the customer considers valuable and more specifically what the 
customer is willing to buy and use. It is also a company that optimizes its 
internal organizational processes toward a focus on customer value. This 
type of company attempts to remove any organizational processes or activi-
ties that do not directly link to customer value. As a simple example, a status 
report requested by manager that has little or no direct benefit to what the 
customer finds as valuable should be eliminated since this task takes time 
from focusing on customer value.

Chapter 2 | Envisioning a Customer-Value-Driven Enterprise  
12
The core of a customer-value-driven enterprise is a mindset that understands 
the importance of discovery and incremental thinking that is ­continuously 
injected with customer feedback. The mechanics that support a customer 
value-driven enterprise is a CVD framework. This framework serves to 
develop products and services around the engagement of customers in each 
aspect of the customer journey from identification and recording the idea, 
revealing it for priority, refining it, realizing it, releasing it, and reflecting on its 
value for the customer. This is why it is important to be truly engaged with 
customers and continuously get their feedback along the journey.
The CVD framework also relies on applying a discovery mindset to learn 
what is valuable to the customer. It leverages current Agile processes, prac-
tices, and techniques by emphasizing the importance to delivering incremen-
tally and frequently so that you are minimizing the risk of delivering something 
that the customer doesn’t want. A CVD framework also applies the adaptive 
Agile budgeting framework, which ensures budget goes to both the highest 
customer-value idea and the team(s) that can build the idea into a working 
product, enabling you to stay in touch with the customer and marketplace in 
a timelier manner.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The Customer-value-driven (CVD) framework focuses on applying customer 
feedback along the way to ensure what is delivered is considered valuable to the customer.
Not only should you identify processes that are not directly assisting with 
identifying or creating customer value, you should also shed those processes 
that are constraining change. While some processes are unrelated or distantly 
related to customer value, there are others that actively restrict, delay, or 
ignore the signals that help us understand what is valuable to the customer.
At the heart of the CVD framework is establishing an engine for customer 
value. This engine emphasizes the importance of getting closer to the actual 
customer and of having a discovery mindset with experimental thinking. It 
highlights the detriment of having too much certainty within an organiza-
tion, while regaling the benefits of challenging assumptions to better under-
stand initial perceived value and shedding those enterprise processes that are 
weighing down the organization.
I will not specifically call out the CVD framework from this point on as the 
intent is to place more focus on the culture and mindset of engaging custom-
ers and collecting their feedback. The goal is to build an organization that runs 
on a customer engine that optimizes for what customers consider valuable 
and optimizes its internal organizational processes toward a focus of deliver-
ing customer value.

The Agile Enterprise
13
The Engine of Customer Value
The goal of a company is to have the willingness to truly engage the customer 
in every step, from idea to delivery and into reflection. The thrusters within 
this engine include activities focused on learning about the current customers 
or potential customers via personas, capturing ideas from customers, getting 
continuous feedback from customers as the product is built, delivering to 
customers, receiving actual customer outcome data (in other words, sales 
or usage), and reflecting on the status of the customer value once it is in the 
marketplace to better understand the next steps of value. This is what I refer 
to as the CVD engine that runs your business (See Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1.  Customer-value-driven engine
To keep this engine running well, you need two important contributors—the 
engaged customer and the engaged employee. Engaged customers ensure you 
move in the direction of customer value. Engaged employees maintain the 
engine so the value is delivered with high velocity and quality. If all thrusters 
are firing well, the engine purrs, which increases the chances for a successful 
delivery of customer value. If one of the thrusters is sputtering or missing, 
it reduces the success of the engine and, hence, reduces the potential value 
being delivered to customers.
What you are also trying to avoid is having an engine whose horsepower 
is diverted to many weighty systems that have little to do with the delivery 
of customer value. Effectively, what you are looking for is building an engine 
where every unit of horsepower is focused primarily on delivering customer 
value.

Moving Away from Certainty
In many organizations, there is a need to act as if you are certain. In fact, the 
higher up you go in an organization, the compulsion of acting with certainty 
becomes greater and greater. Statements like “That’s why we pay you the big 
bucks” are used to imply that the higher you are in an organization, the more 
you are expected to know all the answers. Certainty is an anti-pattern in 
getting to customer value and the polar opposite of what is needed to fuel a 
CVD engine.
Some people think they must act with “pretend certainty” for the benefit of 
their careers. Others have convinced themselves of “arrogant certainty”; they 
believe they know the answer or solution but don’t provide any solid basis 
for this certainty. Unfortunately, this arrogance can be interpreted as confi-
dence that can be dangerous to the success of a company. Nassim Nicolas 
Taleb1 refers to this as “epistemic arrogance,” which highlights the difference 
between what someone actually knows and how much he thinks he knows. 
The excess implies arrogance.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  People with “pretend certainty” and “arrogant certainty” exhibit false 
confidence, which can be dangerous to the success of a company.
What has allowed certainty within companies to thrive is that there is a dis-
tance between the upfront certainty and the time it takes to get to the final 
outcome. There lacks an accountability trail between certainty at the begin-
ning and the actual results at the end. Often the difference is explained away 
by the incompetence of others who didn’t build or implement the solution 
correctly.
The truth is somewhere in between. Unfortunately, the concept of certainty 
is dangerous to an enterprise since it removes the opportunity of acknowl-
edging the truth and allowing the enterprise to apply a “discovery” mindset 
toward customer value via customer feedback loops and more.
You also want to avoid the inverse, which is remaining in uncertainty due 
to analysis-paralysis. A way to avoid this is to apply work in an incremental 
manner with customer feedback loops to enable more effective and timely 
decision making. Customer feedback will provide you with the evidence for 
making better decisions. Applying an incremental mindset will enable you to 
make smaller bets that are easier to take and allow you to adapt sooner.

Adapting toward Value
A healthier and more realistic approach is to have leaders who understand that 
uncertainty is actually a smart starting position and then apply an approach 
that supports the gaining of certainty. The reality is that the earlier you are 
in the lifecycle of the work product, the less customer information and cer-
tainty you have. It is, therefore, incumbent upon you to have an approach that 
admits to limited information and certainty and then apply a discovery and 
fact-building approach toward customer value. This is why you must learn 
more about the customers and their needs for the new idea or feature you 
are building for them.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  As a leader, hire people who have a discovery mindset, who understand that 
customer, technical, and marketplace certainty is only derived by hypothesizing, testing, and 
adapting toward value.
MENTAL CERTAINTY IDENTIFICATION EXERCISE
Identify who among your staff leans more toward the “pretend certainty” or “arrogant 
certainty” mindset and who leans toward the discovery and incremental mindset. 
What you are looking for is building a culture where certainty is something to strive 
for and not a starting position.
Challenging Assumptions
When ideas that are valuable to customers are identified, there are often 
some expressed and many unexpressed assumptions. It is important to tie 
assumptions to the idea that is perceived to be customer value and rigorously 
explore the assumptions. It is often faulty assumptions that lead you to believe 
something is perceived to be more valuable of an idea than it really is. This can 
lead to work that is actually of low value to the customer, closing off options 
for change too early or ignoring valuable customer feedback along the way.
Challenging the assumptions of perceived customer value helps you ratio-
nally discuss the progression of how you got to the conclusion of value. It 
separates what you think you know from what you actually know. By discuss-
ing the assumptions, major uncertainties at the time are uncovered. By high-
lighting these uncertainties, it provides you with information that helps you 
think about how to validate the assumptions. By having a conversation around 
assumptions, it helps those involved with an idea have a better understanding 
of possible customer value and the work ahead.

■
■Agile Pit Stop  Challenging assumptions helps you discuss the progression of how you got to 
the conclusion of value. It separates what you think you know from what you actually know.
Earlier I discussed pretend and arrogant certainty. A good way to uncover 
where the certainty is coming from is to challenge the assumptions that lead 
to certainty thinking. It can be quite dangerous for an enterprise to ignore the 
signals of too much expressed certainty. This can lead a company to select 
lower-value work.
ASSUMPTIONS AWARENESS EXERCISE
Observe those involved in discussing the value of a piece of work. Listen for any 
discussion on the assumptions and any engagement in challenging the assumptions 
of value. If there is little discussion of assumptions, it can mean several things. The 
first is that it can mean that people are not engaged. This can be the result of people 
either just going through the motions of their work, people being fearful to speak up, 
people not wanting to “rock-the-boat,” or people not being aware that they should be 
actively discussing the assumptions. It is recommended to understand the root cause 
of this lack of assumptions discussion. I will discuss how the process of challenging 
assumptions helps you and ways to assertively yet amicably challenge assumptions 
in Chapter 12.
Shedding Enterprise Weight
As part of being a value-driven enterprise, it is important to remove any 
organizational processes or activities that do not directly link to customer 
value. The goal is building a customer-value engine that focuses on delivering 
customer value—not the weight of non-value added activities. This can be 
particularly challenging when those within the organization sub-optimize for 
internal processes or, more dangerously, for themselves.
It is important to gauge what your organization is optimizing for. As you look 
across your organization, do you see processes that are too heavy? I have seen 
groups whose functions are no longer central to the delivery of customer 
value yet continue to enforce their processes on others. I have seen multiple 
levels of management approval where only one (or none) should be necessary.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Is it important to gauge what your organization is optimizing for? Is it the 
customer or internal processes and status quo?

The Agile Enterprise
17
How many of you have witnessed situations where the customer feedback 
clearly told you that you were moving in the wrong direction of customer 
value, yet because of in-house governance and processes, feedback was inhib-
ited or ignored and the original plan was followed anyway. Even when you 
spoke up, those “in-charge” choose to optimize for the process and not cus-
tomer value. This is why the value “responding to change over following a 
plan” found in the Agile Manifesto is so important.
Do you see people who are focused primarily in building their own king-
dom? Are you (or those within the organization) internally sub-optimizing for 
the preservation of the status quo, for ensuring bonuses, or for maintaining 
power positions rather than for satisfying the customer? Some people are so 
entrenched in their internally sub-optimized culture that they do not allow 
themselves to see the need to change until it is too late. However, they pre-
sumably have been allowed and even rewarded to continue this behavior, so 
changes are critical to this mindset.
When adapting Agile, there is often a lack of awareness of the amount of non-
value-added work occurring. Value-added work is requested and validated 
by customers to produce working product. Non-value-added work is work 
not directly adding value as perceive by the customer. Some non-value-added 
work is even less valuable that others. While not all non-value-added work 
can be removed, attempts should be made to make it as lean as possible. As 
illustrated in Figure 2-2, when shedding weighty organizational process and 
non-value-added work, you can turn your cumbersome organization into a 
faster and leaner enterprise.
Figure 2-2.  Shedding processes and non-value-added activities to be a faster and leaner 
enterprise

Chapter 2 | Envisioning a Customer-Value-Driven Enterprise  
18
WEIGHING THE VALUE EXERCISE
Observe the behavior of management and employees, and their contribution to non-
value-added work. Do you see any parts of a process or activity they are involved in 
that seems to have little benefit in the delivery of customer value or are sub-optimized 
to the needs of internal people? Each step of each organizational process should be 
weighed against the customer value delivered. What do you observe?
Management Closer to Customer Value
Every senior and C-level manager should be as close to customer value as the 
product owner, salespeople, marketing department, and development teams 
building products. I’ve been in some organizations where management and 
other significant company members have never seen the products their teams 
are building or met the customers those products are meant for. If a company 
has dozens of products, I’m not suggesting that leadership must be close to 
all of the products, but they should be very close to the top 5 or 10 products, 
including those where there is an investment toward innovation.
The key is narrowing the gap between the employees and customers. The 
two-degrees-of-separation rule can be an effective means to determine how 
far away an employee is from a customer. Two degrees of customer separa-
tion would be “you (as an employee) connected to an employee connected to 
the customer,” as illustrated in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3. Two degrees of customer separation
The further away an employee is from the customer, the less likely that 
employee understands what the customer considers valuable. Worse yet is 
the less employees understand customer value, the less likely they will con-
sider customer value in their work and decision making. This can further lead 
to sub-optimizing toward their own work.

The Agile Enterprise
19
The goal is for all senior managers and C-level professionals to have witnessed 
the company products their teams are building or to have met the ­customers 
those products are meant for. This can be in the form of (and not limited 
to) attending product demonstrations as part of a sprint review, attending a 
­customer advisory board, and visiting customers who are using products from 
the company.
CLOSE TO THE CUSTOMER EXERCISE
Consider conducting research by asking these two questions. Even if you only do this 
as a mental exercise, what might you uncover?
• 
How many of our leaders have attended a demonstration of all 
of our top products (or some percentage of them)? This can be 
a telling tale. I suggest that your leadership should be equally 
comfortable in providing a demonstration of at least some of the 
company’s top products.
• 
Ask each employee (at all levels and functions), “How connected 
is your work to the delivery of customer value?” The goal is to 
make employees aware of the degrees of separation from the 
customer and themselves and at what level their work is related 
to customer value.
Are You Optimized for a Culture of Customer 
Value?
Moving to a culture where customer value is paramount is an important step 
in achieving an enterprise that is truly Agile and the business benefits it can 
bring. Applying a CVD framework and its customer-value engine allows you 
to focus your company’s horsepower primarily on delivering customer value.
Focus on the meaning of having an engine for customer value, the benefits 
of the discovery mindset, the risks of certainty too early, the strategies to 
methodically gain certainty, the task of challenging assumptions to better 
understand the initial perceived value, the necessity of shedding those enter-
prise processes and non-value added activities that are weighing down the 
organization. And, last but not least, focus on getting management closer to 
the actual customer.
It takes a smart leader to recognize the need to change and a strong leader 
to make the changes needed for an enterprise to optimize for the customer. 
This will often mean creating an enterprise where everyone is now one or 
two degrees closer to the customer. It will require a hard look at the current 
talent of managers and individual contributors.

Chapter 2 | Envisioning a Customer-Value-Driven Enterprise  
20
Are people sub-optimizing for themselves? Are they bringing pretend or arro-
gant certainty to their work? Are they engaged with activities that focus on 
customer value? Are they promoting or passively allowing non-value added 
activities to occur at the expense of focusing on customer value? Have they 
actually seen or operated the top products of the company?
The answers to these questions can help you understand the enterprise you 
have. Once you understand this, you can adapt toward the customer-value-
driven enterprise you need.

Achieving 
Better Business 
Outcomes
It’s not about achieving Agile for Agile’s sake. It’s about achieving better 
business outcomes.
—Mario Moreira
I’m Agile, you’re Agile, everyone is Agile. Or folks think they are. But are they 
really? If Agile is implementing a mechanical process to you, then it’s not Agile. 
If Agile is pretending certainty without continuous feedback from customers, 
then it’s not Agile. If Agile is commanded from above with no ownership from 
teams, then it’s not Agile. Unfortunately, what is known as Agile in some places 
is certainly something, just not Agile.

Chapter 3 | Achieving Better Business Outcomes

Moving to Agile is not about achieving an Agile milestone. It is not a destina-
tion, but an enabler in achieving better business outcomes. As part of the 
CVD framework, the Agile culture and practices provide an adaptive mind-
set to discover and deliver customer value in an incremental manner. From 
my journey through the professional world of Agile, I have discovered three 
primary success factors in achieving the chemistry for positive business out-
comes, as shown in Figure 3-1.
A Dash of 
Employee
Engagement
A Pinch of 
Customer
Engagement
Chemistry for positive Business Outcomes
A Spot of 
Being 
Agile
Figure 3-1. Agile plus engaged customers and employees equals better business outcomes
The first factor is applying an Agile mindset based on the Agile values and 
principles (both end-to-end and top-to-bottom) focused on customer value 
with practices that are best suited for your context and environment. The 
second factor is the importance of engaging customers to learn what they 
consider valuable. The third factor is the importance of engaging employees 
who create that value. I call this building an Agile customer-value-driven cul-
ture with a spot of being Agile, a dash of employee engagement, and a pinch 
of customer feedback—a combination that serves as the chemistry for better 
business outcomes.
Embracing the Agile Values and Principles
What is Agile? Most people think it is a process, a set of practices, and even 
tools. But it is none of those things. Agile is nothing more and nothing less than 
a set of values and principles. As it relates to success, Agile is the enabler that 
harnesses the power of employees and feedback from customers for success-
ful deliveries in a frequent manner.

The Agile Enterprise
23
I purposefully include Agile values and principles in this chapter as a reminder 
and refresher. It is important to read and internalize the Manifesto for Agile 
Software Development if you are serious about understanding an Agile state of 
mind and truly want to “be Agile.”
The key change within the manifesto I would encourage, both in the values 
and principles, is to replace the word “software” with “product” or “services,” 
depending on your context. The reason is that the iterative and incremental 
nature of Agile can work well beyond software and into any creative and 
knowledge work, whether it be products, services, or other types of work.
As a reminder, here is the Agile manifesto1: It is comprised of just 73 words 
and was signed by 17 authors in 2001.
Manifesto for Agile Software Development
“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and 
helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items 
on the left more.”
The last phrase helps you understand the authors’ intentions. They are not 
saying there is no value in the items on the right, but instead that there is more 
value with the items on the left. It is importance to strike the right balance. 
As you evolve toward Agile, you will find that you will lean more toward the 
items on the left.
Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
We follow these principles2:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous 
delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes 
harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
1Manifesto for Agile Software Development, agilemanifesto.org

Chapter 3 | Achieving Better Business Outcomes
24
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple 
of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the 
project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment 
and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and 
within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, 
developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace 
indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances 
agility.
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is 
essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-
organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, 
then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
AGILE PRINCIPLES ALIGNMENT EXERCISE
Take a moment to reflect on these principles. In a group, what principles do you agree 
with or disagree with and why? How can you promote and adapt your enterprise to 
better align with these principles?
Enabling Agile with Processes and Practices
The goal of an Agile process, method, practice, and technique is an attempt 
to absorb the Agile values and principles and put them into practice. As part 
of the spot of being Agile, an enterprise needs to embrace the Agile values and 
principles and apply Agile processes, practices, and techniques that support 
the Agile values and principles that enable it to deliver customer value in a 
incremental manner.

The Agile Enterprise
25
The Agile processes and methods include Scrum, eXtreme Programming 
(XP), Dynamic-System-Delivery Methodology (DSDM), Feature-Driven 
Development (FDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), Lean Software 
Development, Kanban, Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Disciplined Agile 
Delivery (DAD), Lean Startup, and Value Flow Quality (VFQ). This book also 
introduces you to the customer-value-driven (CVD) framework that applies 
a discovery and incremental approach that focuses on engaging customers in 
each aspect of the product journey from identification and recording the idea, 
revealing it for priority, refining it, realizing it, releasing it, and reflecting on its 
value for the customer.
In addition, a further array of innovative Agile practices can be applied in vari-
ous parts of your Agile galaxy in an attempt to ensure Agile is occurring at 
all levels of an enterprise. This expands the groundwork done by a number 
of Agile innovators that established many of the current Agile processes and 
practices. By highlighting the many processes, frameworks, and practices does 
not imply that any one is better than another or others not discussed here. 
There is no one correct process or methodology. What you will find is that 
what suits your working environment and your type of work is the best for 
your company. My goal is to harness you with a collection of Agile concepts, 
mindset, processes, practices, and techniques to enable you to more effec-
tively help your enterprise discover and deliver customer value.
Engaging Your Customers and Employees
Success factors in creating a thriving business is the level of engagement 
from the people within and around your enterprise. In other words, do you 
have a culture where customers and employees are engaged? I’m not talk-
ing about the lip service that is prevalent today. In some cases, you see quite 
the ­opposite, where employees are disenfranchised and customers are rarely 
engaged. Instead, the goal is to have a culture and practices in place that truly 
gain the benefits of engaging with customers and employees. By applying a dash 
of employee engagement and a pinch of customer feedback, a company draws its 
power from an Agile culture and, I contend, becomes a thriving company.
In creating that engine of customer value introduced in Chapter 2, employees 
are the mechanics of the engine and customers are the drivers. If there is little 
customer and employee engagement, the enterprise is going nowhere or it is 
going in the wrong direction. The more engagement at both levels, the more 
positive the progress.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Engaged customers are the drivers and empowered employees are the 
mechanics of the engine of customer value.

Chapter 3 | Achieving Better Business Outcomes
26
When you have a riveting focus on the customer, you have the basis for a 
relationship where you can truly understand what the customer wants. When 
you have a sharp focus on employees and provide them the ownership to 
make decisions and own their work, you will begin to understand the value 
an engaged employee base can provide. I will cover ways to engage customers 
and employees in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.
Focusing on Outcomes
Becoming Agile should not be an end goal. Becoming Agile should be a means 
to an end. The end goal is the desired outcome of achieving better business 
results. The Agile mindset and practices, therefore, should be an enabler for 
better business results. This end goal is often lost in the enthusiasm of becom-
ing Agile. An outcome is defined as the result of a particular action or, in 
Agile’s case, an Agile transformation. Since moving to Agile requires a change 
in skills, process, and culture, it involves effort. The whole point of the effort 
is to achieve better outcomes for the company.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  If the focus is delivering something the customer wants, you must move from 
primarily measuring outputs to primarily measuring outcomes.
To achieve better business outcomes, you must deliver products that custom-
ers like. An output is the delivery of a release or the number of releases. An 
outcome is how many customers either bought or used the product. Often 
people focus on outputs because they tend to be easier to measure or are a 
carryover from a more traditional mindset.
The danger of focusing on outputs is that you may have a high number of 
outputs with a low number of outcomes. Outcomes are what drives business 
success. As illustrated in Figure 3-2, it appears that the output of the fourth 
quarter is the best. However, if you look at the outcomes chart, the third 
quarter is the best quarter with revenues of $80,000 instead of only $20,000 
in the fourth quarter. While the output of four releases sounds good, $20,000 
is not favorable to good business results. Outcomes ask you to measure  
different things, with a particular focus on customer value.

The Agile Enterprise
27
Becoming outcome-focused has several business advantages. Outcomes focus 
on the impact of your work (for example, the number of customers and the 
number of sales). Just because you delivered a release (in other words, output) 
doesn’t mean you had a positive impact to your sales numbers. An outcome 
focus also changes your perspective from an internal one to a customer or 
external perspective. This enables you to better understand what you are 
aiming for in the CVD world that you need to establish. For a deeper discus-
sion on using outcome measures to help run your enterprise, consider visiting 
Chapter 20.
Do You Have the Recipe for Success?
Moving to Agile is not about achieving an Agile milestone. Instead, Agile and 
the CVD framework is about achieving better business outcomes. A move to 
Agile is a move to a culture focused on customers and what they identify as 
valuable as well as on engaged employees who create that value. It is a shift 
in mindset.
Then you add the enabler of Agile and the continuous and adaptive nature 
it brings. This can lead to better outcomes such as an increase in customer 
­satisfaction and customer revenue. This can be the differentiator between 
the success of your organization compared to the success of other organiza-
tions. Do you have the recipe for success? This recipe consists of a spot of 
being Agile (culture), a dash of employee engagement, and a pinch of cus-
tomer engagement for a taste of better business outcomes. The areas of Agile 
culture, employee engagement, and customer engagement will be expanded 
further in subsequent chapters.

Building Your 
Agile Galaxy
Being Agile and deriving the business outcomes means you need to have 
a thriving top-to-bottom and end-to-end Agile landscape.
—Mario Moreira
Agile has been in the limelight for well over a dozen years. Agile has secured 
its place within the software development community and now it is spreading 
into many other areas of business where the incremental nature and promise 
of better business outcomes are very tantalizing. Many people are realizing that 
a more iterative approach allows them the flexibility to adapt to the changing 
needs of customers and the continuous churning of the marketplace. Others 
would like to apply Agile because they are hearing about it from all corners of 
their professional life and think maybe its time to get on the bandwagon. For 
many reasons, there are real benefits that can be derived from applying Agile.
As simple as it may seem, to establish the Agile landscape and reap the ­positive 
business outcomes requires a combination of Agile processes, roles, and the 
all-important culture. For Agile to work well, all levels of the enterprise must 
play their part in the Agile journey and toward the delivery of customer value. 
This journey includes having Agile culture and practices applied at all levels.

Chapter 4 | Building Your Agile Galaxy
30
Finally, establishing Agile implies a strong cultural element that focuses on how 
individuals and organizations must behave and operate to truly focus on a 
customer-value-driven approach. To be specific, Agile processes, practices, and 
techniques and those playing the roles must operate within an Agile cultural 
context and that context must exist at all levels of an enterprise.
Landscape of the Agile Galaxy
As we look across your enterprise, it is important to establish a landscape 
to better view where Agile is being applied. I term this landscape the “Agile 
galaxy” (see Figure 4-1). It is the landscape where all Agile processes, roles, 
and culture live that have a focus on delivering customer value. It helps us 
understand where Agile is adopted.
Exec level
Hierarchical         Axis    Team Level
Record Idea                              Delivery
Axis                 Release Idea
Figure 4-1. Agile galaxy: Landscape for your Agile culture and practices
The Agile galaxy has a vertical view titled the hierarchical axis, where the exec-
utives are at the top and the teams are at the bottom (although this can be 
reversed). It also has a horizontal view titled the delivery axis that ­illustrates 
the end-to-end flow of work from the moment an idea is recorded to the point 
where it is released and then reflected upon. The delivery axis is the channel by 
which the enterprise is focused on delivering customer value.

The Agile Enterprise
31
The purpose of establishing your own Agile-galaxy construct is for you to 
understand where along both the delivery and hierarchical axis you have 
Agile-related elements (such as concepts, mindset, practices, processes, and 
techniques) being applied and where in relation to this landscape they are 
occurring. Where is Agile primarily being implemented? What Agile practices 
are being applied? Where do we see an Agile culture and the behaviors being 
adopted?
Whether you are in the midst of your Agile transformation or you are look-
ing to begin the journey, it is beneficial to have a living Agile galaxy related 
to your enterprise. This will help you understand where Agile is occurring 
and where you need to focus next. It is very reasonable to approach an Agile 
transformation in an incremental manner. For each increment, you should 
reflect on what practices are being applied, what roles are applying it, and the 
current state of the culture from an Agile perspective. You may consider it 
a heat map of where Agile is occurring. As you plan the next increment, you 
can use this as input on where you want to go next. Let’s more fully explore 
your Agile galaxy.
Holistic Process View of an Agile Galaxy
The goal of building your Agile galaxy is having Agile applied at all levels with 
a focus of delivering customer value. However, what tends to be common is a 
propensity to initiate Agile at the team level. It is not surprising that Agile has 
lived through its first dozen years with a more-or-less team focus. The reasons 
are severalfold.
The evolution of many of the early and current Agile processes, practices, 
and techniques are primarily focused on the team level. There are few Agile 
elements focused on the beginning of the delivery axis (such as recording and 
refining ideas). There is less focus on the Agile culture regarding behaviors 
and mindset. Many Agile coaches tend to be experienced mostly at the team 
level with few who have substantial experience at the enterprise level. It is also 
much easier for management to ask the team to make the change to Agile 
without themselves committing to the Agile change.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Many organizations still have a team-centric view of Agile.
Because of these reasons, it is not uncommon to primarily see Agile practices 
occurring in the bottom right corner of the Agile galaxy. Because of this team-
centric view of Agile, companies have Agile elements in action at the team 
level, and they have fewer elements as they move up along the hierarchical 
axis toward middle management, then senior leadership, and finally toward the 
beginning of the delivery axis in valuing ideas.

Chapter 4 | Building Your Agile Galaxy

Using the Agile-galaxy context, Figure  4-2 illustrates what a team-centric 
implementation of Agile might look like. Each Agile element represents an 
Agile process, practice, or technique. A dot is not meant to be specific to a 
particular Agile element, but to illustrate where Agile elements most com-
monly live in team-centric Agile implementation.
Figure 4-2. Where Agile elements live in a team-centric implementation of Agile
It will be very challenging for teams to operate in an Agile ­manner when the 
more senior level of the organization is not. If management along the hierar-
chical axis and recording and refining ideas along the delivery axis are applying 
a big-batch view of the work, it can be hard for teams to apply an incremental 
and adaptive view of the work. Also, if the enterprise operates with an annual 
budget cycle where ideas are recorded and parsed once a year, it can be very 
hard for a team to adapt to customer needs and marketplace when new ideas 
are coming in regularly.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Having one part of the enterprise work on an annual scale while another works 
on an iterative and incremental scale creates a pace difference that causes great tension within 
the system, inhibiting adaptability and innovation.

The Agile Enterprise
33
A more holistic and healthy Agile galaxy is where an enterprise has Agile 
elements occurring throughout the galaxy, both on the delivery axis and the 
hierarchical axis. This way the concepts, mindset, practices, processes, and 
techniques being applied are Agile-related, and the company does not experi-
ence the tension of the pace difference when one part of the enterprise runs 
as Agile and the other part runs as traditional.
A more holistic and healthy Agile galaxy has a reasonable application of Agile 
elements in all quadrants of the galaxy. Figure 4-3 illustrates this Agile galaxy. 
Compare it to Figure 4-2, which illustrates a team-centric Agile galaxy. Notice 
how there are more Agile elements in the upper part of the hierarchical axis 
and more elements in the front part of the delivery axis.
Figure 4-3.  Holistic and healthy Agile galaxy of Agile elements
While newer processes and practices are being established beyond the team 
level, I contend that there needs to be a fundamental shift toward approach-
ing Agile in order for companies to take the most advantage of the business 
outcomes it can bring.

AGILE ELEMENTS IN YOUR AGILE GALAXY EXERCISE
What Agile elements (processes, practices, tools, and techniques) do you have and at 
what levels are they implemented? Consider creating the process view of your current 
Agile galaxy using the landscape illustrated in Figure 4-1.
Holistic Roles of the Agile Galaxy
Similar to the Agile process elements, a more holistic and healthy Agile galaxy 
is where all members of an enterprise plays their role within an Agile context. 
This means that the roles that are both along the delivery axis and the hier-
archical axis are contributing to the delivery of customer value. Those playing 
the roles would apply the Agile concepts, mindset, processes, practices, and 
techniques.
Because of the team-centric view of Agile in many companies, those ­playing 
the team-level roles have engaged in applying Agile concepts, processes, and 
­practices. However, levels of management and operational roles (HR, finance, 
marketing, and so on) within an enterprise along both the vertical and ­horizontal 
axis tend to play a lesser role in Agile and the incremental and customer value-
driven focus that is needed.
Figure 4-4 illustrates what a team-centric-role implementation of Agile might 
look like. Each dot represents a person within the enterprise that is playing his 
or her role in an Agile manner.

The Agile Enterprise
35
Interestingly enough, in some enterprises, there is often a CEO or head of 
engineering that is pro-Agile, as illustrated in Figure 4-4 (the two dots toward 
the top of the hierarchy). However, in those same organizations, there is often 
little or no buy-in of Agile at the middle-management level. Having some roles 
engaged in Agile while others engaged in a more traditional or command and 
control manner creates tension regarding ownership and pace of work.

A more holistic and healthy Agile galaxy has people in all quadrants of the 
galaxy who have adapted their roles to apply Agile with a focus on delivering 
customer value. Figure 4-5 illustrates the holistic and healthy Agile galaxy so 
that it can be compared to Figure 4-4, which illustrates a team-centric Agile 
galaxy.
Figure 4-5.  Holistic and healthy Agile galaxy where all roles are aligned with Agile
Organizational functions must all play a role in transforming to Agile. Each role 
or function must be structured such that they can readily adapt to the chang-
ing needs of customers and conditions of the marketplace. To understand the 
expectations of what roles and responsibilities would look like within an Agile 
landscape, please visit Chapter 8.

AGILE ROLES IN YOUR AGILE GALAXY EXERCISE
What roles do you see that are engaged in Agile and are focused on primarily delivering 
customer value? Consider creating the roles view of your current Agile galaxy using 
the landscape illustrated in Figure 4-1.
What Does Your Agile Galaxy Look Like?
When I explore the concept of the Agile galaxy with colleagues, I often wit-
ness “a-ha” moments. For so long now, Agile has been implemented at the 
team level that for some it is a new revelation when they look above their 
current Agile horizon and realize there is more territory to cover. Roles at all 
levels in the enterprise must play their part in the creation of customer value. 
The need to have Agile processes, practices, and techniques for all levels in the 
enterprise is becoming apparent to many.
The good news is many people are starting to make the connection that it does 
take an enterprise to establish an effective Agile galaxy focused on ­delivering 
value to the customer. Hopefully, this book helps you in that ­journey to evolve 
your current Agile implementation toward the enterprise level, ­cultural level, 
and the customer-driven level where it needs to be.

Activating an 
Agile Culture
Culture highlights the type of company you are. But what type of company 
do you really want to be?
—Mario Moreira
People are often searching for the silver bullet to transport an enterprise 
toward Agile and the business benefits it can bring. For some, Agile has become 
little more than a superficial badge without aligning to the real cultural shift 
that is needed to truly become Agile. Many tend to lean toward implementing 
a set of mechanical practices or processes. While this is part of the equation, 
the most important part is having a commitment to adopt the Agile mindset.
A move to Agile implies a change to the organizational culture. It is a cultural 
disruption that takes effort and that is never painless. Adopting Agile is more 
than a matter of learning skills or understanding a process; it requires adopting 
a set of values and principles that require change in people’s behavior and the 
culture of an organization.
A culture change implies a behavioral change in people in response to a 
change in the values and assumptions of their organization. In other words, 
they need to assume a new way of thinking. It also asks them to measure 
different things, with a particular focus on customer value and the activities 
focused on obtaining customer value. This kind of culture change takes time. 
This is why I ­suggest that you think of your change to Agile as a cultural journey.

Chapter 5 | Activating an Agile Culture

Agile Mindset
Agile is a disruptive innovation where the Agile values and principles require a 
significant change of mindset and behavior to the culture adopting it. I discuss 
the concept of this significant change as crossing the Agile chasm in my book 
Being Agile.1 The chasm represents a leap from the old mindset and ways of 
thinking to a specific cultural mindset of “being Agile” in order for the enter-
prise to fully realize the business benefits Agile can bring.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Crossing the Agile chasm means that you are always operating with a mindset 
that is aligned with the Agile values and principles and a focus on customer value.
Crossing the Agile chasm means your mind has achieved an Agile mindset. 
As illustrated in Figure 5-1, in order to achieve an Agile mindset, you must 
embrace the Agile values and then operate in a manner that aligns with the 
Agile principles with a focus of delivering customer value. The result of achiev-
ing an Agile mindset means you should see different behaviors and a change 
in the culture. Simply aligning with Agile values and principles should lead 
you to behavioral changes in responsibilities, assurances to engage custom-
ers, ­commitment to empower employees, an obligation to bring business and 
development together, and more.
Figure 5-1.  Getting to an Agile mindset
1Being Agile, Chapter 2, by Mario Moreira, Apress, October 1, 2013

The Agile Enterprise
41
To help an enterprise put the Agile values and principles into action, vari-
ous Agile processes, methods, frameworks, practices, and techniques (in other 
words, mechanics) have been created. However, without a commitment to 
the Agile values and principles, you may find that you are going through the 
mechanical motions without grasping the benefit of uncovering better ways 
of working.
As an example, a retrospective can mechanically occur with no actions for 
improvement upon completion. Without embracing Agile principles, the 
objective of tuning and adjusting behaviors can be forgotten. Some Agile 
implementations have adopted the outer ring of Agile processes while not 
embracing Agile values and principles. Without embracing the values and 
principles, you cannot achieve the behaviors necessary for an Agile mindset.
Those companies that are “doing” Agile have not actually adopted the val-
ues and principles and not made the mindset shift to actually “being” Agile. 
Such companies continue to look at Agile as a set of skills, tools, and pro-
cess changes, but they have not made the integrated behavioral and cultural 
changes. They have not made the significant change of mindset required to 
make the leap across the Agile chasm.
Three Dimensions of an Agile Culture
What a more holistic and healthy Agile galaxy should look like is where those 
playing the roles in all quadrants of the galaxy have embraced the Agile mind-
set of applying the Agile values and principles—a discovery and incremental 
mindset; they have embraced the various Agile elements of processes, prac-
tices, and techniques, and they are primarily focused on delivering customer 
value. As you may recall, the Agile galaxy illustrated in Figure 4-1 is two-
dimensional. There is also a third dimension that factors in the cultural aspect, 
as shown in Figure 5-2. Have the people in your Agile galaxy embraced the 
Agile mindset and begun to exhibit Agile behaviors of the Agile values and 
principles?

Chapter 5 | Activating an Agile Culture
42
Because of the team-centric view of Agile in many companies, there is a like-
lihood that some people playing the team-level roles have adapted an Agile 
mindset. However, levels of management and operational roles (HR, finance, 
marketing, and so on) within an organization along both the vertical and hori-
zontal axes tend to play a lesser role in Agile and, in many cases, have not 
evolved their roles toward an Agile mindset, which includes an incremental 
and customer value-driven focus.
For every practice being implemented and for every role being played, there 
is a view of the cultural and behavioral alignment to the Agile values and 
principles. Is it positive where behaviors are aligning with an Agile mindset? Is 
Agile still a mechanical implementation where behaviors are neutral (in other 
words, neither particularly positive or negative toward an Agile mindset)? Or 
is the attitude toward Agile more negative where people are openly disdainful 
of Agile and there is still an alignment to the hierarchical, traditional, and/or 
command-and-control mindset?
Your three-dimensional Agile galaxy may have areas in the positive where 
people have embraced the Agile mindset, some areas that are neutral, and 
some areas in the negative. The 3-D view can help you understand the start-
ing point of where your culture is today and help you understand the culture 
change that needs to occur.
Third Dimension

CULTURE OF YOUR AGILE GALAXY EXERCISE
As you look across your current galaxy, do you see people and groups applying the 
Agile elements (processes, practices, and so on) in a manner that is aligned with the 
behaviors of Agile values and principles and a discovery and incremental mindset? 
Are they focused on delivering customer value? Is it positive where behaviors are 
aligning with an Agile mindset? Is it neutral (neither positive or negative) toward an 
Agile mindset or negative toward an Agile mindset? Apply a designation by individual, 
group, or area.
Culture of Agile Values
Everyone in the organization should understand and embrace the Agile val-
ues and principles. Chapter 3 provides us with a section on the Agile values. 
Although many people are aware of them or have seen them at one time or 
another, few remind themselves of what it means to be Agile on a regular 
basis, particularly when they are buried in the mechanics of doing Agile.
It is beneficial to periodically review the Agile values and discuss them at 
a deeper level. Here is a deeper look at the four polar pairs of agile values 
declared in the Agile manifesto.
“Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” This value helps us 
understand that the way we work may adapt over time. It also ensures that a 
predefined process or tool does not dictate how we interact.
“Working software over comprehensive documentation.” This value helps us 
understand what the customer values as well as the business perspective of 
the product we are building. I often replace the word “software” with “prod-
uct” or “service” since not everything built is software.
“Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.” This value helps us under-
stand the importance of the customer relationship and the collaboration that 
is needed to get to what the customer finds as value.
“Responding to change over following a plan.” This value helps us respond to 
the changes in customer needs and market conditions, and apply an inspect-
and-adapt approach with customer feedback to lead to customer value.
Ordering Agile Values Exercise: In groups of three, rank in order of 
importance the values and explain your ranking. Share the reasons of your 
rank order with other groups.

Chapter 5 | Activating an Agile Culture
44
Remembering the Agile Principles
The Agile principles provide us with guidance on how to operate within 
an Agile galaxy. Chapter 3 provides us with the 12 Agile principles for your 
review. Interestingly, many involved with Agile have a hard time remember-
ing the principles. I have hypothesized that those involved in Agile are more 
knowledgeable about the mechanics of “doing Agile” than they are regarding 
the mindset shift needed for “being Agile.” I have also hypothesized that fewer 
people could name three of the twelve Agile principles than could name three 
of the five Scrum events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, 
and Sprint Retrospective).
I tested my second hypothesis with an experiment that asks people to record 
the Agile principles and the Scrum events. For the Agile principles, I was willing 
to accept even a keyword or phrase of the principle (for example, “welcome 
change”). From two different Agile professional events, I asked participants to 
write down as many of the five Scrum events and as many of the twelve Agile 
Principles they knew. I accumulated 109 survey responses. The results were 
revealing and supported my hypothesis, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3.  Percentage of respondants who could name a specific number of Agile principles
Of the 109 Agile participants, 59% knew three of the five Scrum events. This 
emphasized knowledge of the mechanics, or doing Agile. As illustrated in 
Figure 5-3, only 11% knew three of the twelve Agile principles. Could it really 
be true that only 11% of Agile enthusiasts could name just three Agile prin-
ciples? This small percentage is particularly concerning since the Agile values 
and principles form the basis for what an Agile culture should look like.

The Agile Enterprise
45
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Many people are only mechanically “doing” Agile via a process and have not 
yet begun to “be” Agile (that is, actually applying the values and principles of Agile).
Based on this data, I concluded with two hypotheses for such a lack of aware-
ness of Agile principles. The first is there is very little education focused on 
the Agile values and principles. While many people have once visited the Agile 
values and principles (typically in training), they tend to not visit it again. The 
second is that many Agile efforts jump right into doing Agile by applying an 
Agile process (the mechanics) with little focus on the Agile values and prin-
ciples (the culture). I contend that it is much easier to show progress for a 
mechanical change (for example, “Here is our backlog.” “See the daily scrum.”) 
than show cultural and behavioral changes, which takes longer for the changes 
to be felt.
AGILE PRINCIPLES REFRESHER EXERCISE
Ask each person on your team to write down the Agile principles they know. Collect 
their answers. Then discuss each of the Agile principles with the team, explaining 
each one and asking team members what they think about each principle. Once your 
team members have had time to think about each principle, ask each person to again 
write down as many Agile principles they know and collect this answers. Tally up both 
sets of answers (before and after) and highlight the increase in learning. Doing this 
test periodically is a good way to remind people why they are being Agile.
Cultural Color of Your Organization
To delve a bit deeper into understanding more about what an Agile culture 
might look like, it is worth exploring the book Reinventing Organizations.2 In this 
book, Frederic Laloux discusses the past and current organizational models. 
He describes organization paradigms as an evolution in human consciousness. 
The more recent paradigms can provide insight into organization attributes 
that lend themselves to an Agile culture. Figure 5-4 illustrates the evolution 
of these paradigms.
2Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux, Nelson Parker, February 20, 2014

Chapter 5 | Activating an Agile Culture
46
The early paradigm starts with the reactive-infrared paradigm and then the 
magic-magenta paradigm. Both of these embody the early stages of human 
kind which include smaller groups such as tribes of people. This is followed 
by the impulsive-red paradigm, which has the guiding metaphor of a wolf pack 
illustrated by tribal militia, mafia, and street gangs.
The conformist-amber paradigm has the guiding metaphor of an army illus-
trated by the hierarchy of a church, the military, and most government agencies. 
Next is the achievement-orange paradigm, which has the guiding metaphor of 
the machine illustrated by multinational companies and charter schools. A 
majority of the organizations today tend to reflect a red, amber, or orange 
paradigm.
A general alignment can be made to two of the latter paradigms that may be 
considered as behaviors you would hope to see in an Agile enterprise. These 
are the pluralistic-green and the evolutionary-teal paradigms.
While these two stages are not meant to be Agile-specific, in understanding 
what an Agile culture might look like, they help shed light as to where you may 
want to explore. Since Agile may be considered the next step in the evolution 
of product development, it should come as no surprise that the green and teal 
paradigms are the latest in organizational evolution.
Where Pluralistic-Green Supports Agile
The pluralistic-green organization strives to bring equality where all view-
points are treated equality, irrespective of position and power. It uses the 
family as the guiding metaphor where all members are in it together and help 
each other out. This is highly reflective of the expectation of an Agile team.

One of the breakthroughs of a green organization is empowerment. 
Empowerment is focused on pushing a majority of decisions down to the 
frontline (in other words, where the work is). This is directly aligned with 
Agile thinking where there is a focus on pushing down decision making to the 
lowest possible level where the most information resides regarding the topic. 
This leads to decentralized authority where employees are trusted to come 
up with the answers and think of better ways to solve problems.
Another breakthrough of a green organization is that it is a values-driven cul-
ture. There is an understanding that culture drives how an organization will 
live and breathe. The green organization understands that a shared culture 
where leaders play by shared values is the glue that makes those in orga-
nizations feel appreciated and empowered. There is a focus on culture and 
empowerment to achieve extraordinary employee motivation. This values-
driven culture described in the green paradigm is very much aligned with the 
importance of leading with Agile values and principles.
Leaders in a green organization are servant leaders. Servant leadership is com-
mon in Agile literature. Leaders need to listen to their employees, motivate 
them, empower them, and help them develop their own skills. When hiring for 
leadership within a green organization, look for the right mindset and behav-
ior and ask if the candidates are ready to share power and lead with humility.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The Pluralistic-Green and the Evolutionary-Teal Paradigms include the level of 
human consciousness and the manifest behaviors you hope to see in an Agile enterprise.
Where Evolutionary-Teal Supports Agile
The evolutionary-teal paradigm emphasizes that the organization moves 
beyond providing a vehicle to achieve objectives for others. Instead, it moves to 
provide what is best for the organization that adapts as circumstances change. 
Its metaphor is one where the organization is a separate living organism.
In a teal paradigm, titles and positions are replaced with roles where one 
worker can fill multiple roles. This is very much like the concept of the cross-
functional team within an Agile team structure. It is also emphasized by the 
notion of lightning-bolt-shaped teams where every team member has a pri-
mary, secondary, and tertiary skill or role so that they can adapt to the need 
of the organization. The emphasis is on getting the work done and not on 
specific titles or positions and the constraints one skill will have.

Chapter 5 | Activating an Agile Culture
48
The evolutionary-teal paradigm emphasizes the capability to self-organize 
around the organizational purpose. The hierarchical structures are replaced 
with self-organization focusing on the smaller teams. This is aligned with the 
Agile principle of self-organizing teams. (In other words, the best architec-
tures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams). In fact, 
one of the breakthroughs of moving to the teal paradigm is self-management 
where an organization operates as if there are no managers.
It is in the teal paradigm where we evolve beyond and become separated 
from our ego in order to better understand the wisdom of others. We have 
to learn to see our own world from the outside. The analogy that Laloux uses 
is “like a fish that can see water for the first time when it jumps above the 
surface.” Once we can separate from our ego, we begin to understand how 
our ego has separated us from others. To a great extent, this is where the 
Agile retrospective helps team members see the views of others in order to 
improve and evolve into a more effective team.
Much like a move to an Agile culture is a leap across a chasm to a wholly 
different mindset, a move to the evolutionary-team paradigm. It is akin to 
crossing a chasm to operate in a self-managed way where mistakes are an 
opportunity to learn and grow, and where we strive for a wholeness within 
ourselves and with others.
Readying the Culture
Most Agile transformations start with implementing the Agile mechanics of 
processes, practices, and techniques. These types of transformations tend to 
ignore the cultural aspects of Agile. Since Agile is a cultural change, consider 
starting your Agile transformation from a cultural perspective.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Readiness activities are akin to conditioning the soil prior to planting the seeds. 
Understanding Agile values and principles improves the ability to adopt Agile.
Readying the mind is akin to conditioning the soil prior to growing the seeds. It 
is worth taking a long hard look at the conditions of the fields, equipment, and 
people—an analogy for your Agile galaxy. Strengthening the soil helps improve 
its physical qualities. This is similar to educating people about Agile values and 
principles and a customer-value-driven enterprise prior to any mechanical 
implementation. It provides employees with a cultural understanding of what 
they are trying to achieve.

The Agile Enterprise
49
What are some readiness activities you can do to begin activating the Agile 
culture? Begin by readying the minds or your employees with education on 
Agile values and principles and customer value. Ask employees what an enter-
prise would look like that puts the values and principles into action. Highlight 
what more advanced organizations can look like by discussing the pluralistic-
green and evolutionary-teal paradigms. Ask what an engaged employee looks 
like in an Agile culture. Ask what an engaged customer looks like in an Agile 
culture. Also, start to examine levels of willingness and capability among the 
employee base so you understand the current level of commitment. You can 
learn more about readiness activities in the book Being Agile.3
Assessing the Culture You Have
As you begin your readiness activities, consider understanding the culture that 
you have. There is a saying in the culture change circles that you should “meet 
them where they are.” By understanding your Agile culture, you gain the benefit 
of having a baseline by understanding the pros and the cons of the culture, 
which helps you prioritize your Agile readiness activities ahead. It can be used 
in the future to see where you’ve made progress.
Below is an Agile cultural assessment survey based on desired Agile behav-
iors. It helps you understand where you are from a customer-value-driven, 
employee-engagement, customer-engagement, Agile-values-and-principles, 
and pluralistic-green-paradigm, and evolutionary-teal-paradigm perspective. 
For each statement, the participants choose an option that best aligns with 
their view. They may also rate how they think their leaders view the statement. 
Or they can answer for both themselves and their leaders to recognize differ-
ences. Consider applying using a Likert-scale framework as seen in Figure 5-5.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive statement list and you may adapt it to fit 
your needs. You may find additional questions that can help you gauge whether 
you are aligning with an Agile culture in the books Being Agile (Chapters 8 and 
9) and Reinventing Organizations (Appendix 4).
“What Culture Do You Have?” Exercise: Arrange to have a group of 
leaders together. Share the statements with them and ask them to choose 
their level of belief for each statement (from strongly agree to strongly dis-
agree). Tally up the results and find the average score. Also capture the range 
of scores (3 at Strongly Agree, 2 at Agree, 4 at Somewhat Agree, and so on). 
Identify an area of improvement.
What Culture Do You Have?
There is a recognition that it is time to get serious about adapting to an Agile 
mindset and the behaviors and culture change it brings instead of a having a 
mechanical approach. A strong Agile culture must focus on how individuals 
and organizations behave and operate at all levels of an enterprise.
Consider understanding the culture that you have by establishing the 3-D 
version of your Agile galaxy. Also consider completing the Agile cultural 
assessment survey initially with some of your trusted colleagues and then 
branching out to other teams.

Embracing 
Customers
If you are not optimizing for customer value, why are you in business?
—Mario Moreira
What is a customer? A customer is someone who has a choice of what to 
buy and a choice of where to buy it. As it relates to your company, a cus-
tomer pays you with money to help you stay in business by purchasing your 
product. Because of these simple facts, engaging the customer is of utmost 
importance. Customers are external to the company and it is their feedback 
that matters most. While you can find value in what an internal person says, 
it is an opinion and that person cannot provide your company with money.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Customers are a very specifically defined. (1) They have a choice to buy your 
product, and (2) they pay money to your company. This definition represents an important mindset 
shift.
In working with a number of companies, two challenges have become clear. 
The first challenge is that some companies do not really engage their custom-
ers to get their feedback. As mentioned in Chapter 2, instead there may be 
the certainty mindset occurring, either pretend or arrogant. This prevents 
the opportunity of gaining the valuable customer feedback.

Chapter 6 | Embracing Customers

The second challenge is that the term “customer” is being applied to a num-
ber of people “in” the company who are “not customers.” For further clari-
fication, a customer is someone external to the company and meets the 
conditions previously stated (has a choice and pays). When you incorrectly 
title someone a customer when they are not, your company will not really 
be customer-value-driven as you are not using actual customer feedback to 
drive toward customer value.
Driver of Customer Feedback
Customer engagement focuses on establishing meaningful and honest 
­customer relationships with the goal of gaining continuous customer feedback 
to truly identify what is valuable to the customer.
The key to engaging customers is to gain their precious customer input and 
feedback. The input and feedback should be the basis for driving a major-
ity of your decisions and setting the direction of a product. As you look to 
build a customer-value-driven engine within your enterprise, the customer, 
or more specifically customer feedback, is the “driver” that steers the engine 
of ­customer value, as illustrated in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1.  Customer feedback is the driver that steers the customer-value-driven engine
If you start driving with certainty, either pretend or arrogant, you can be led 
to the wrong planet, moon, or satellite because you are flying blind and miss-
ing the signs that steer you toward value. The question is, “Who do you want 
steering your spaceship?” Do you want someone internal to your company 
that embraces certainty but is wearing blinders, or do you want someone 
who embraces customer feedback and continually adapts (that is, steers) 
their way toward customer value?

The Agile Enterprise

Customer Feedback Bull's-eye
The customer provides the most effective feedback to help shape product 
direction toward customer value. The customer provides both input for ideas 
of value and feedback for validating the product in its process of getting cre-
ated. It is critical to engage customers. Look around you at your teams. Are 
you and your teams directly applying customer input and feedback toward 
customer value? If not, then you are probably guessing, and this means that 
it is time to methodically engage with customers.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Customer input and feedback are the two primary guides toward customer 
value.
Within an Agile context, the customer is the most important voice in shaping 
the direction of the product. Your goal is to identify and engage customers, 
which can help you shape the product journey. Not all customers are created 
equal. Some customers are committed to your product, while others may 
have mild interest. Some customers use the product one way, while others 
use the product another way.
This is where the importance of customer personas comes into play. If one 
user uses a computer to program and another uses a computer to work on 
spreadsheets, you have two different customer personas who use a com-
puter. The primary message is to understand that there are various types of 
customers in your customer journey. You can learn more about the impor-
tance of personas and how to establish and use personas to get closer to 
customer value in Chapter 14.
Since you may have multiple customers, you need someone to engage with 
the various types of customers. Within an Agile context, the product owner 
is meant to be the voice of the customer and should be educated on how to 
engage, solicit, converge, and prioritize feedback from customers. You can 
learn more about the product owner and other roles in an Agile context in 
Chapter 8.

As you look beyond customers and product owners, you must recognize that 
there are people within the company that are engaged in bringing a successful 
product to market. I term these people the stakeholders. They contribute 
to the success of the product by providing a healthy environment to work, 
crafting a strategy or vision, identifying product and services ideas, under-
standing the marketplace, engaging with customers at some level, or building 
the product. Now that you are familiar with customers, product owners, and 
stakeholders, the next step is to establish your customer feedback bull's-eye.
Figure 6-2 illustrates the concept of a customer feedback bull's-eye where 
the customer is in the middle followed in the next ring of the circle by the 
product owner. They are surrounded by stakeholders. Those stakeholders 
closer to the customer that bring customer feedback into the process would 
be the next circle within the target. This would be followed by those less 
customer-focused.
Figure 6-2.  Customer feedback bull’s-eye
CUSTOMER BULL'S-EYE EXERCISE
Create your customer feedback bull's-eye diagram. Do you have engaged customers 
in the middle? Do you have committed product owners in the next ring? What other 
stakeholders within your enterprise play a role in contributing to customer value? 
Consider the ratio of feedback coming from the customers vs. stakeholders. Do you 
think your company can benefit from more direct customer feedback?

The Agile Enterprise

Customer Universe Surrounding the Agile 
Galaxy
Chapter 4 discusses the Agile galaxy and how it represents the Agile land-
scape within your company. Where do customers live in relation to your 
galaxy? From a business context, your Agile galaxy is within a sea of the cus-
tomer universe. As illustrated in Figure 6-3, customers live all around your 
Agile galaxy (or at least you hope they do!). What you hope is to tap into 
those customers and find out what they need and then build it.
Figure 6-3. The Agile galaxy surrounded by the customer universe
On the left side of the delivery axis of the Agile galaxy is where you capture 
ideas of customer value. The ideas can come from various places—from 
people within the company and from customers external to the company. 
Engaging customers can start by soliciting their ideas for customer value or 
getting their feedback on whether an idea is perceived to be of value.
There are many places to gain the valuable customer input and feedback all 
along the delivery axis. Customer feedback is an important component of 
the CVD framework. This includes customer input and feedback when cap-
turing, valuating, refining, developing, and releasing an idea to reflecting on 
the results of an idea.

Chapter 6 | Embracing Customers
58
Customers form the basis for a value-driven enterprise. A well-run startup 
painfully understands the value of customer feedback since it can make a 
difference whether it goes under or grows. Ensure customers are an inte-
gral part of your value-driven engine. To put customer feedback into action, 
consider reading Chapter 14, where you learn how to establish a customer 
feedback vision.
Customers in a Value-Driven Enterprise
How are customers and a value-driven enterprise related? The definition of 
a CVD enterprise is a company that optimizes for what the customers find 
as valuable and more specifically what they are willing to buy and use. This is 
why it is so important to think like the customers.
What the customers see as progress is not the standard project documents, a 
project plan that indicates the task completion, or status reports. Rather, cus-
tomers see progress as tangible working product functionality. They purchase 
working product, not the plans, status reports, and other administrative items.
Customers delight in seeing working product in action and the inspect-and-
adapt approach allows customers to consider and adjust their needs until they 
are transformed into a valuable working product. Progress is not advanced 
until a piece of functionality is built with quality, meets the customer accep-
tance criteria, and is available for review by the customer.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  What the customer sees as progress is not a project plan or status reports. 
Rather, customers see progress as a tangible working product.
Functionality equates to value for the customer and ultimately means deliv-
ering business value. This implies that you have to continuously engage with 
the customer to get there. Engaging with customers only while gathering 
requirements and approaching product release is not enough. You need to 
continuously engage with customers as you are actively building the product 
throughout its life cycle.

The Agile Enterprise
59
Learning Your Way to Customer Value
The concept of learning what the customer finds as valuable is an important 
mindset in the journey of customer value. It allows us to shed the dangerous 
attitude of pretend or arrogant certainty and allows us to really explore what 
the customer needs. When you fix customer requirements up front and plan 
the path to delivery without continuously engaging with the customer, you 
might stick to the plan with success, but you will incrementally veer away 
from what the customer finds valuable. Figure 6-4 illustrates this challenge.
Figure 6-4. Aiming for customer value
The question is, “Is it better to stick to the plan or adapt toward customer 
value?” How many people have seen companies decide to stick to the path of 
pretend or arrogant certainty, inevitably creating a product that few custom-
ers want, ergo missing customer value? While this may sound obvious, have 
you ever encountered companies where the plan rules?
The moment you engage with customers on a continual basis, the plan will 
not survive. Is it better to deal with a changing plan and deliver something 
the customer actually wants, or is it better to stick to the plan and end up 
delivering functionality the customer does not want? Keep in mind that if you 
are not listening to your customers, your competitors will be.
The better approach is to incorporate the concept of learning what is customer 
value. This is a discovery method of gaining incremental information through 
various methods associated with getting customer feedback and taking what 
you learned to continuously adapt toward customer value. Continuous learn-
ing of customer needs is important to get closer to certainty. As illustrated 
in Figure 6-4, the incremental nature of adapting to what is learned leads us 
toward the customer value target. Learn more about the discovery mindset and 
how it can help you adapt your way to delivering customer value in Chapter 10.

Enterprise Anti-patterns of Attaining Customer 
Value
Value is in the eye of the beholder. Smart people will say that the beholder is 
the customer. While in most companies, there will be a saying similar to “the 
customer is king,” some have lost their way and have somehow forgotten the 
importance of customers and their feedback. The result is enterprise anti-
patterns that impede customer value. There are a number of anti-patterns 
on why this occurs and the following are four:
• 
Believing that you can pretend to know what the cus-
tomer wants upfront with certainty. This Pretend Certainty 
anti-pattern has the consequence of limiting options and 
being blind to customer needs.
• 
Focusing primarily on driving efficiencies through cost 
cutting and applying high utilization of people. This No 
Room at the Innovation Inn anti-pattern has the unintended 
consequence of a lesser focus on the customer with little 
room to innovate and adapt.
• 
Sub-optimizing for the comfort of having a ­well-established 
plan and set of well-defined processes. This Sub-optimizing 
for Comfort anti-pattern has the consequence of limiting 
change at the expense of adapting to customer needs.
• 
Engaging few customers to represent the customer pool. 
The Few and the Missing anti-pattern has the consequence 
of missing customer needs.
When you are a startup, you realize the importance of being customer-
value-driven because if customers don’t buy the product, the startup goes 
under. That doesn’t mean that a startup has the right product, culture, or 
processes to become successful; it is that they know that without under-
standing customers’ needs, their hopes for a successful product or service 
are slim. Because of this and their small size, most startups will stay very 
close to the customer or potential customer.
When companies become larger, there is a greater chance the anti-patterns 
that impact customer value will exist. There is a likelihood of adding more 
processes, which results in more steps away from employee to the customer. 
As companies grow, there are tendencies to put more controls in place to 
manage cost and, unfortunately, this leads to restricting change. A company 
begins to optimize for its own processes and plans. This distances itself from 
customers. As a company grows, there needs an explicit action to remain 
close to the customer. The question for you is, “Do you see these anti-­
patterns effecting customer value in your enterprise?”

The Agile Enterprise
61
■
■Agile Pit Stop  As companies grow, controls are put in place to manage cost and more 
processes and plans are used. Both can restrict change and increase distance from customers.
One of the Agile values is responding to change over following a plan. While 
there may be a high-level benefit to a plan, responding to changes from cus-
tomers is where there is more value. More information on the Agile mani-
festo and its values and principles can be found in Chapters 3 and 5.
Customer Challenges of Understanding Value
Another primary reason why it can be challenging to get to customer value is 
that many times the customers don’t really know what they want. They think 
they know what they want and they will attempt to provide their best guess 
on what they are looking for.
There are number of reasons for this. First, customers cannot always articu-
late their needs at the moment you ask. Instead, they may provide an idea that 
may solve their most current issue, which may not really lead to their biggest 
need. Second, customers are not aware of the options or possibilities so they 
tend to gravitate toward what they know. A rumored quote by Henry Ford 
highlights this mindset, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would 
have said ‘a faster horse’.” Third, the landscape of customer needs changes 
regularly. Customer value can be an elusive target and changes constantly. If 
customers have to wait six months or a year for what they want, they may 
have moved on and now want something different.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Often customers don’t know what they want until they see it, ergo the 
importance of the sprint review or demonstration.
This is where the advantage of a discovery and incremental mindset comes 
in handy. This way, you can learn what the customer wants. A corollary to this 
is that the customers don’t know what they want until they see it. By initiat-
ing demonstrations, customers can see what they said they wanted and can 
respond toward what they really want. Inversely, when building something that 
is considered innovative, showing the customers something that is incremen-
tally being built offers them the opportunity to respond toward customer 
value.

Is Customer Feedback an Integral Part of Your 
Customer-Value Engine?
This chapter walks us through many aspects in understanding customers and 
the importance of their feedback. A customer is very specifically defined. 
Customers have a choice and they pay money to your company. Some orga-
nizations apply the term “customer” too liberally to those internal to the 
company. While such people are stakeholders, they are not the customer. 
This is an important mindset shift, and this message needs to be shared with 
all of those within the enterprise.
Customer feedback provides the direction that steers the customer-value 
engine toward the direction of customer value. Customers see progress as 
working product and delight in seeing working product in action. The discov-
ery and incremental approach allows customers to reflect on and adjust their 
needs until they are transformed into a valuable working product. Believing 
that progress is best realized in the form of working product is an important 
mindset shift to embrace.
Identifying what the customer finds as valuable is a learning opportunity and 
an important mindset in the journey toward customer value. It allows us 
to shed the dangerous attitude of pretend or arrogant certainty and really 
explore what customers need. At the end of the day, it is important to make 
the customer king. You just need to ensure the customers are guiding you by 
gaining their valuable feedback along the way.

Embracing 
Employees
Treat employees as if they are your partners because they are the voice 
of your company.
—Mario Moreira
One of the Agile values and two of the Agile principles specifically focus on 
the importance of employees. The Agile value states, “Individuals and interac-
tions over processes and tools.” The Agile principles state: “Business peo-
ple and developers must work together daily throughout the project” and 
“Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and 
­support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”
Extracted from these values and principles are collaboration, motivation, and 
trust. These are key values of an Agile culture where employees matter. When 
employees are engaged, they become instrumental to the success of the com-
pany. They are empowered to make decisions, they are motivated themselves 
and they motivate each other, they willingly contribute innovative ideas, and 
they are willing to go the “extra mile” to get the work done. When employ-
ees have ownership, they have more passion for their work. The question is, 
“Are you investing in the cultural change where you embrace employees and 
ensure they know they matter?”

Mechanics That Tune the Engine of Customer 
Value
Applying the analogy that a company is the engine of customer value, we real-
ize that an engine needs mechanics. As illustrated in Figure 7-1, employees are 
the mechanics that make your customer-value-driven engine purr. A mechanic 
that feels ownership of the engine is motivated to work on the engine, enjoys 
collaborating with others on the engine, is empowered to improve the engine, 
and is trusted to make the changes in a safe environment. As a result of this 
ownership, you will find that you have an engaged and happy employee.
Figure 7-1.  Employees are the mechanics that make the engine of customer value purr
An unhappy employee will be disengaged and allow the engine to sputter. 
When employees are disengaged, they take long lunch hours and will not stay 
in the office a moment longer than they have to. More importantly, they will 
not engage their minds to solve problems effectively. They may not contribute 
to and may even impede their company's success.
Happy employees continuously look for ways to improve the engine. Frederic 
Laloux1 writes that pluralistic-green organizations, which focus on culture and 
empowerment, achieve extraordinary employee motivation. The study “The 
Impact of Empowered Employees on Corporate Value”2 reveals that employee 
empowerment within the corporate culture is a “potential source for sus-
tained superior financial performance.” Employees can be a company’s great-
est assets. They can be the mechanics that keep the CVD engine purring to 
move the company forward.

■Agile Pit Stop  A culture where employees matter can achieve extraordinary employee 
motivation and is the potential source for sustained superior financial performance.
Just saying, “Our employees are our most valuable assets,” is not enough and 
has become a standard cliché. Can you back it up? Here are areas that you can 
explore to gauge if your enterprise believes that employees matter.
The COMETS within Your Agile Galaxy
COMETS stands for Collaboration, Ownership, Motivation, Empowerment, 
Enthusiasm, Trust, and Safety—the values that an organization must embrace if 
they believe employees matter. These values should be nurtured and become 
part of an Agile culture that values its employees and understands their impor-
tance for the success of building customer value. (See Figure 7-2.)
Figure 7-2.  Employee culture of COMETS builds texture to your Agile galaxy
It is important to understand that when the term employee is used, it applies to 
all employees, from team members to executives. As illustrated in Figure 7-2, 
the COMETS culture should be pervasive across your enterprise. All lev-
els should be exhibiting collaboration, ownership, motivation, empowerment, 
trust, and safety (just in different ways). For example, ownership implies a 
bounded authority where executives have ownership of work at their level 
(for example, strategy) and teams have ownership at their level (for example, 
user stories in backlog). (See Chapter 8 for more on bounded authority.)

Chapter 7 | Embracing Employees
66
As you explore each value, what actions and behaviors would you expect to 
see? The following is a quick definition of each of the attributes of COMETS. 
Collaboration is the ability to work with someone to build something. Ownership 
is feeling that you have the right to control and enjoy an area of work or work 
item. Motivation is a willingness or desire to do your work. Empowerment is 
the belief that you have the right to set the direction of something. Trust is 
confidence regarding an expectation. Safety is having the belief that it is safe to 
learn and take risks.
Self-Organizing Teams
COMETS form the building blocks to self-organization. Key to having an Agile 
environment where employees are engaged and believe they matter is estab-
lishing a culture where employees have the ability to self-organize around 
the work. Self-organizing teams are defined as a group of people who have 
autonomy and a common purpose for deciding how to build something in a 
collaborative manner.
The Agile manifesto calls out self-organizing as one of its principles, “The best 
architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.” 
There are two mindset shifts involved in having self-organizing teams become 
part of the culture. The first mindset shift is for management to understand 
that those with the most knowledge (that is, the team) should be the ones 
deciding the technical evolution of the business needs. This means less depen-
dency on management. The second shift is for the team to be aware that 
accountability and responsibility of completing the work falls on them. As 
you can see, teams gain flexibility on deciding how to build something within 
their bounded authority, but they also gain the discipline of accountability and 
responsibility for the work.
Within an Agile context, self-organization requires several key elements. The 
first is that there is a common purpose for the work to help guide the team 
(such as release goals and sprint goals). The second is that there is a bounded 
authority on the work the team owns and they are empowered to determine 
how to build the product. The third is that the team uses a build-inspect-adapt 
type model (applying one of the Agile processes). Inspecting requires both 
verification (testing) and validation (customer feedback) to help build in the 
direction of customer value.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Within an Agile context, self-organizing teams require a common purpose, 
bounded authority, and a build-inspect-adapt type model (an Agile process).

The Agile Enterprise
67
The primary benefit of self-organizing teams is that when employees feel they 
own the work, they tend to have more passion. Consequently, they are likely 
to invest more of their time and energy. The implication is that the company 
may gain the benefit of stronger employee commitment and performance, 
leading to potentially superior financial results. Now let’s explore the building 
blocks of self-organization (that is, COMETS) in more detail.
Collaboration
Collaboration from an Agile and business perspective is defined as two or 
more people creatively working together with a common purpose to produce 
a positive business outcome. Within the context of self-organizing teams, it 
is important for team members to collaborate. Notice I used the terms “cre-
atively” and “positive” in my definition. Collaboration is meant to produce an 
outcome. It is meant to bring people and their knowledge together to create 
something new or different. If two people are not being creative, then it is just 
two people doing something operational.
Collaboration in my definition is meant to be positive. There is such a thing 
as “bad” collaboration when not everyone has the same common purpose. 
“Good” collaboration relies on an environment where people honestly align 
with the common purpose and willingly accept new knowledge in an open and 
trusting manner to create something new.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Collaboration is defined as two or more people creatively working together 
with a common purpose to produce a positive business outcome.
From the employees’ perspective, collaboration provides them with the 
opportunity to team up with people pursuing a common purpose and to learn 
from each other along the way. Effective collaboration requires employees 
to connect with people and with their inner selves. It teaches them to work 
more effectively and can lead to a high-performing team.
It is important not to confuse collaboration with communication and coor-
dination. Collaboration is a two-way action where two or more people work 
together to produce a positive outcome. Communication is a one-way action 
of sharing information in writing, speaking, or other medium. Coordination 
is often a one-way action of bringing together various elements to enable an 
activity.

Chapter 7 | Embracing Employees
68
Coordination can promote a more effective collaboration outcome, and com-
munication can be used to share the results of the collaboration. Combined 
with ownership and empowerment, collaboration allows employees to own 
and change the direction of the work. This leads to happier employees who 
feel their abilities are being put to good use.
Ownership
Ownership is probably the most important factor in gauging whether employ-
ees matter. Ownership is defined as having the authority and the resources 
necessary to do work effectively. When employees feel ownership of their 
work, they typically take more pride, put more effort, and bring more quality 
to their work. Within the context of self-organizing teams, each team under-
stands what work it owns within its bounded authority.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  When you own a home, you will likely take better care of it. You will likely invest 
time and money to improve it because you feel the pride of ownership.
In which scenario will a person put more effort? Is it to maintain a rented 
apartment or maintain an owned home? If you don’t own something, you are 
likely to invest less effort. When you own a home, you will likely take better 
care of it and be more likely to invest time and money to improve it because 
you feel the pride of ownership. In fact, you are more likely to protect and 
defend it. If employees feel ownership of their work, they will much more 
likely be willing to invest extra time and bring high-quality labor to the work.
As illustrated in Figure 7-3, a change in ownership will involve a cultural shift 
to move the level of decisions to the lowest possible level. This may include 
reducing the need for numerous approvals. This can be a big change for most 
organizations, but it has the benefit of speeding up the flow of work. Make 
sure you remember that management still has a role to play. Managers need 
to establish an environment where employees can be most productive and 
provide them with a vision of where the enterprise is headed.

The Agile Enterprise

Motivation
There is a strong link between successful companies and those companies 
whose employees describe themselves as motivated. Motivation is a construct 
of internal and external factors that drive how people behave. A motivated 
employee may put in more effort with a greater focus on quality. Employee 
motivation methods have been explored for years due to the possibility of 
increased company success. In the context of self-organizing teams, the goal is 
to provide employees with reasons to be motivated.
What are the drivers of employee motivation and what does it mean to an 
employee? Early notions of motivation tended to focus on the extrinsic moti-
vation methods to engage employees, while more recent research recom-
mends exploring the intrinsic motivation methods that are better suited to 
engage employees.
Extrinsic Motivation
The extrinsic motivational methods focus on motivators that come from out-
side the employee. In the early twentieth century, extrinsic motivation tech-
niques were characterized by the use of both rewards and punishments.
Figure 7-3.  Empowerment model: Moving authority to the lowest level where knowledge 
exists

Chapter 7 | Embracing Employees
70
The carrot-and-the-stick method is an early example of an extrinsic motiva-
tor. It refers to a cart pulled by a donkey. A carrot is tied to a stick and dangled 
in front of the animal just out of its reach. As the donkey moves forward to get 
the carrot, it pulls the cart. If the donkey isn’t motivated by the carrot, a stick 
hits the donkey’s backside to move it forward.
The modern version of the carrot and stick is called the Expectancy Theory 
(that is, if you do something, you can expect a reward). While advanced, 
today’s performance systems are mostly based on tangible rewards and pun-
ishments. There are many extrinsic motivators related to tangible rewards 
such as money and grades as well as psychological gains such as recognition 
and celebrity. These types of motivation are external elements outside of the 
employees in an attempt to motivate them. Many employees are well aware of 
these obvious ploys to motivate them.
There are some benefits and risks of extrinsic motivators. The first is that they 
may promote employees’ doing activities needed to gain the reward, but this will 
often have only a short-term change because the moment the reward is gone, 
the activities and behaviors may stop. Instead, consider intrinsic motivators.
Intrinsic Motivators
The intrinsic motivational methods focus on those motivators that come 
from inside the employee. These are driven by an interest that exists within 
the individual. In this case, the motivation to engage in an activity or behavior 
arises from within the employee because it is intrinsically rewarding and not 
because of an external prize.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Intrinsic motivators come from within the employee. Extrinsic motivators come 
from outside the employee. Intrinsic motivators are more effective.
There are intrinsic motivators related to a sense of value, meaning, progress, 
and competence. These types of motivation may be driven by enjoyment, curi-
osity, ownership, autonomy, and pride. What are specific examples of intrinsic 
motivators? They may involve contributing to a team (for example, building 
a product), to a cause (such as increasing the number of women in leader-
ship), or to a movement (for instance, being Agile). They may involve gaining 
­mastery in a domain (for example, Agile and Java programming).
Intrinsic motivators are best applied when identifying an employee’s 
­consequential purpose. The more consequential the purpose, the more self-
motivated an employee becomes. In relation to an Agile culture, it may mean 
that you have a feeling of ownership of the work. It may mean that you have 
autonomy in your work, such as deciding what work you do, how you do the 
work, and what the pace of the work will be.

The Agile Enterprise
71
There are major benefits for intrinsic motivators. Employees are often more 
creative when they are intrinsically motivated. This can lead to more innova-
tion of products. If the intrinsic motivation has to do with competence, there 
can be higher quality in the products being built. Intrinsic motivators lead to 
long-term change of mindset since the motivator is from within and doesn’t 
rely on an external reward, which can disappear.
Avoid mixing external motivators with internal motivators. It can be tempt-
ing to identify the intrinsic motivator and add an extrinsic reward to it. For 
example, when you offer a reward to something that an employee already 
finds fun, it often transforms the “fun” into work or obligation.
WHICH MOTIVATORS EXERCISE
Within your own organization, what extrinsic and intrinsic motivators do you see 
occurring? Are there any extrinsic motivators that are getting in the way of progress? 
Are there intrinsic motivators that could be promoted?
Empowerment
Everybody has heard the term empowerment in organizations—typically to hype 
up a new initiative so that employees will feel empowered. However, it should 
be a core value of an organization’s strategy and not a trend that comes and 
goes. Unfortunately, this is not the case for many organizations. Empowerment 
is defined as having the autonomy and accountability to organize and make 
changes to one’s own work and his or her surroundings. Within the context of 
self-organizing teams, team members are empowered to decide how to build 
their product (architecture, design, UX, development, testing, and more).
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Employee empowerment isn’t just a warm and fuzzy benefit for the workers, 
and it can lead to tangible performance and financial gain for an organization.
What exactly is employee empowerment? In Figure 7-4, Jane Smith presents 
an employee empowerment model that includes three degrees of empower-
ment.3 The first level encourages employees to play a more active role in 
their work. The second level asks employees to become more involved with 
improving the way things are done. The third level enables employees to make 
bigger and better decisions without having to engage upper management. The 
third level is key for an Agile culture.

If management is earnest about applying a model like this, managers may 
see improvements in the quality of their product delivery, more innova-
tion, increased productivity, and a gain in competitive edge. Empowerment is 
enhanced when an adaptive framework like Agile is applied, which advocates 
a team-based model. If the team feels truly empowered and can self-organize, 
they will naturally increase their productivity because they are empowered to 
make decisions to guide their work lives.
Trust
One of the Agile principles states, “Build projects around motivated individu-
als. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get 
the job done.” Trust is defined as having confidence in another person that 
something will get done. Within a self-organizing team, trust is developed 
among team members when they can rely on each other that work will get 
done or that help will be asked for.
Some people say trust is earned. I suggest that trust should be given. This 
is often seen as a change in mindset. Much of what you learn about trust 
is through negative experiences. This can teach some of us to start with a 
guarded view, which makes us believe that trust should be earn. It can feel 
safer, but this can be a less productive way of approaching trust.

You hire people who you trust can do the job. At the same time, either by 
your negative experiences or by the multiple levels of approvals, you build 
an environment where there is insufficient trust given. Have checks and safe-
guards been added to replace trust? If you don’t trust, the safeguards are only 
a process layer that bandages the problem of trust and are often impeding the 
speed of delivery.
A better way is to start from a trust position. In the COMETS culture sur-
rounding your Agile galaxy, is it better to start with a positive and approach-
able worldview or from a negative and adverse worldview of those around 
you? Give your colleagues the trust and support to get the job done. Trust is a 
critical element for healthy relationships, teams, organizations, and communi-
ties. Employees are your partners. Giving them the right environment, tools, 
and culture will help them thrive and, in turn, it will help the business thrive.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Instead of saying trust must be earned, a better way is to start from a positive 
position of trust. You hired people who can trust, didn’t you?
Accept the fact that everyone is indeed human and subject to faults. Also, 
before assuming that anyone is at fault, verify that you provided team mem-
bers with the support, impediment removal, and lean processes that would 
enable them to succeed. Often the reason trust is broken is because the 
system, processes, or cultures around a team are broken. Always look to see 
what you can fix for a team or employees.
Trust Relationships
Trust is developed through relationships with those around us. These rela-
tionships are at various levels and need to be developed and continually 
maintained. As illustrated in Figure 7-5, relationships tend to be horizontal 
(peer-to-peer at roughly similar levels) or hierarchical (employee-to-manager 
or seasoned employee to junior employee).

Chapter 7 | Embracing Employees
74
In most work places, there is more complexity to building a trusting environ-
ment beyond your peers and manager. Relationships can include intra-team 
trust from team member to team member and inter-team trust from team 
member to a member of another team, team member to direct manager, and 
team member to indirect manager.
In any of these scenarios, start from a trust position. Attempt to make con-
nections with anyone you work with beyond work tasks. This helps employ-
ees gain familiarity and empathy with each other. When it comes time to 
work together, emphasize listening skills to reduce misunderstanding. Building 
healthy relationships among employees and between employees and managers 
will be discussed further in Chapter 8.
Safety
There are two types of safety that factor into a healthy and productive enter-
prise environment. The first is physical safety. A physically safe environment is 
where employees are free from physical hazards and can focus on the work at 
hand. This type of safety should be part of the standard workplace promoted 
by company and government regulations.

The second safety type is psychological safety, which is core to enterprise 
effectiveness. According to Google research, high-performing teams always 
display psychological safety. This phenomenon has two aspects. The first is 
where there is a shared belief that the team members are safe to take inter-
personal risks and be vulnerable in front of each other. The second is how this 
type of safety, along with increased accountability, leads to increased employee 
productivity and, hence, high-performing teams.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team members are safe to take 
risks and be vulnerable to each other. With accountability, this leads to high-performing teams.
Psychological safety helps establish an Agile environment that promotes a safe 
space for employees to share ideas, discuss options, take methodical risks, and 
become productive. An Agile mindset promotes self-organizing teams around 
the work, taking ownership and accountability, and creating an environment 
for learning what is customer value through the discovery mindset, divergent 
thinking, and feedback loops. Agile with psychological safety can be a powerful 
pairing toward high-performing teams.
However, accountability without psychological safety leads to great anxiety. 
This is why there is a need to move away from a negative mindset when 
results aren’t positive or new ideas are seen as different. If employees do not 
feel safe psychologically, they are less willing to share ideas and take risks. 
Instead, consider ways to build psychological safety paired with team owner-
ship and accountability of the work.
Everyone has a role to play in establishing a psychologically safe enterprise. 
ScrumMasters and Agile coaches can educate and coach teams to apply psy-
chological safety and accountability. Leadership can provide awareness of the 
importance of a safe environment, give education on this topic, and build posi-
tive patterns in the way employees respond to the results of risks taken by 
team members and others. Employees at all levels must be aware of the atti-
tudes and mindsets they bring.
Understanding Employee Engagement
How do you know you have engaged employees? Organizations have used 
Gallup, Inc., for years to help understand their employees’ level of engagement. 
Gallup spent decades developing the Q12 instrument, which provides 12 well-
honed questions measuring the extent to which employees are “engaged” in 
their work. While some will say correctly that a manager or supervisor has 
the greatest impact on the level of a satisfied or engaged employee, Gallup 
indicates that it is realistic to assume that numerous people in the workplace 
can influence an employee’s engagement level.

Chapter 7 | Embracing Employees
76
Since a number of people may influence an employee’s engagement level, you 
need to address the culture in which the employee works. In relation to Agile, 
one way to gauge employee engagement is to discuss it in relation to the Agile 
values and principles, which provide strong guidance at both the individual 
level and the organizational levels.
SUPPORT FOR AGILE PRINCIPLES EXERCISE
Ask employees at what level (strongly agree to strongly disagree) of support they feel 
that the organization around them gives the 12 Agile principles. For those with lower 
support (disagree) responses, ask what better support for a principle would look like. 
Consider sharing results with senior management.
Another way to gauge the employee engagement level is to ask employees the 
Gallup’s 12 questions and gather their responses (strongly agree to strongly 
disagree). To gain triangulated feedback, it may be beneficial to ask them from 
both from the Gallup view and from the Agile view.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  What are some ways to gauge employee engagement and find out if employees 
understand that they are important to the company? Just ask them. Asking them directly gets to 
the point.
Of course, there is the direct way. You simply ask them. Ask the employees 
if they feel they matter to the enterprise. Ask them if they feel they can col-
laborate. Ask them if they feel ownership of their work. Ask them if they are 
motivated. Ask them if they feel empowered to make changes to their work 
environment. Ask them if they trust their teammates and their managers. As 
them if they believe they are allowed to self-organize around their work. This 
approach will require someone who is trusted to lead the people through the 
questions or it can be done in a self-organizing way where employees lead 
themselves through the questions.

The Agile Enterprise
77
What Is Your Employee Culture?
When you look across your enterprise, what employee culture exists? Is 
the culture focused on self-organizing teams and aligned with the values of 
COMETS and the Agile values and principles? Do the employees feel owner-
ship of maintaining the engine of customer value? Are they free to collaborate? 
Are they motivated to do their best? Are they empowered and self-organized 
to determine how to improve the engine and build the customer value? Are 
they trusted to make the decisions and do what is best? Do they feel safe 
to take risks? If they are, congratulations! If not, you have an opportunity to 
embrace a culture where employees matter.

Evolving Roles 
in Your Agile 
Enterprise
If your role has not adapted, you may not be part of the Agile transformation.
—Mario Moreira
An Agile and customer-value-driven enterprise is an organization that 
optimizes its roles in a manner that focuses on the Agile values and principles 
and customer value. This focus may necessitate shifts within an enterprise. 
The first shift is that employee roles should evolve toward aligning as closely 
to the customer and the creation of customer value. The second shift is 
that enterprises should add Agile activities that support customer value and 
remove activities that do not directly link to customer value.
In both shifts, the implication is that roles may evolve or become obsolete, 
or new roles may emerge. A litmus test to gauge whether your enterprise 
is Agile is to determine if any of the roles have changed. If you don’t see a 
change in roles when the enterprise evolves to become more Agile, then it 
probably isn’t Agile.

Optimizing Enterprise Roles for Agile
Organizational roles and their functions are part of transforming to Agile. 
What this means is that each function must operate such that it can readily 
adapt to the needs of customers and market conditions. Are current roles 
and their functions constraining or embracing the need to adapt toward 
customer value? Embracing the need should be the goal.
What roles and functional areas should be optimized to the changing needs 
of customers and marketplace in order to have better business outcomes? 
The short answer is all roles and job functions should contribute. Figure 8-1 
illustrates many of the key roles that are new or should adapt toward an 
Agile mindset and align with the delivery of customer value.

Figure 8-1.  Roles in an Agile enterprise
What you are really looking for is what roles directly contribute to customer 
value. As discussed in Chapter 2, the two-degrees-of-customer-separation 
rule can be an effective means to determine how far away any one employee 
is from the customer. Two degrees of customer separation would be “you 
(as an employee) connected to an employee connected to the customer.” 
The farther away employees are from the customer, the less likely they 

The Agile Enterprise
81
understand what is considered valuable to the customer. Aligning the roles 
in your Agile galaxy to customer value will often require a shift in how the 
organization is run and may entail adapting roles and responsibilities.
Obvious Agile Roles
If you look across an Agile galaxy, there are obvious roles and less obvious 
roles that should be adapted toward an Agile mindset and aligned with the 
delivery of customer value. As illustrated in Figure 8-2, the obvious roles 
tend to primarily focus on the team level. However, in an Agile enterprise, 
the norm is that all roles adapt toward an Agile mindset and align with the 
delivery of customer value. If they do not, there may be an opportunity to 
streamline toward alignment to customer value.
Figure 8-2.  Obvious plus less obvious equals an Agile enterprise
Roles in the “obvious” group tend to be the first to apply Agile for several 
reasons. Development teams are more receptive to apply Agile. Management 
departments, on the other hand, find it easier to ask teams to change to 
Agile without themselves committing to the change. Also, team-level Agile 
processes are more prevalent and have a mechanical feel, making it easier to 
apply the culture changes.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  It should be obvious that all roles should adapt toward an Agile mindset and 
align with customer value. Today some are obvious and some are less obvious.

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise
82
In both the obvious and less obvious sections, there is advice on how to 
adapt each role. However, all roles should start by gaining the knowledge of 
the information in Chapters 2–7. These chapters highlight what it means to 
be a customer-value-driven enterprise, the importance of the customer and 
employee, what an Agile galaxy looks like, and what it means to embrace the 
Agile mindset. All roles should have this level of understanding. The role or 
functional areas that tend to fall into the “obvious” grouping are:
Development Teams
A development team consists of a group of people focused on building 
the product or service. It is comprised of cross-functional roles such as 
development, quality assurance (QA), database, user experience (UX), 
documentation, education, and so on.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, development teams must 
learn the Agile values and principles and apply Agile behaviors and processes 
as they incorporate customer needs into the delivery of customer value. They 
should apply a discovery and incremental mindset and processes that will 
help them evolve their deliverable toward customer value. While technically 
focused, they should gain business knowledge from the product owner so 
they can better understand the customer and customer value.
ScrumMaster
The ScrumMaster is the facilitator for a team applying the Scrum process 
when building customer value. ScrumMasters lead the team through planning, 
daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and supporting the demonstrations. If not 
using Scrum, the role may be called the Agile facilitator or coach.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, this new role focuses the 
team on the Agile mindset, Agile processes and practices, and the delivery 
of customer value. This new role in Agile often replaces project managers; 
ScrumMasters act more as facilitators of the Agile process and servant leaders 
to the team. This may be a significant shift for some companies where functional 
managers or project managers have always played a more directive role.
Product Owner
The product owner (PO) role is responsible for identifying and prioritizing 
the work according to customer value and for incorporating customer input 
and feedback to better align with customer value as the product evolves.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, the PO is the champion and 
owner of customer value. This may be a shift for some companies where others 
play this role. The PO works with the team to ensure the team members 

The Agile Enterprise
83
realize customer needs and the business perspective of the work. The PO is 
the customer advocate and captures customer feedback to move the product 
in the direction of what the customer actually needs. The PO contributes to 
sprint planning and invites customers to attend the demonstrations.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The PO is the champion of customer value and the customer advocate. The PO 
captures customer feedback to move the product in the direction of what the customer actually 
needs.
This new role may be played by an existing role engaged with the customer, 
such as product manager or business analyst. It requires the person performing 
the role to engage regularly with the team. The PO must have decision-
making rights to steer the product toward the direction of customer value. 
For more information on PO responsibilities, see Chapter 14.
Product Owner Constellation
A PO works within a sea of ideas that come from many places. Many ideas 
come directly from customers and others come from those within the 
company. To bring customer value ideas together, a PO should form a product 
owner (PO) constellation, consisting of employees who help the PO focus on 
customer value. Figure 8-3 is an example of a PO constellation.

Figure 8-3.  Product owner (PO) constellation

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise
84
While the PO is the person ultimately responsible for prioritizing and owning 
customer value, it is good to have a PO constellation that includes other 
roles and functions that provide input to decision making for determining 
customer value. Other roles that can provide input are business analysts, 
management, salespeople, marketing experts, and field engineers.
Less Obvious Agile Roles
There are role and functional areas that are often missing from the Agile 
galaxy. These roles and areas need to be more engaged and adapt to an Agile 
mindset and practices to make for a more thriving Agile customer-value-
driven enterprise. Given that early Agile processes tended to focus on the 
team level, this is not surprising. However, in order to have an end-to-end 
and top-to-bottom enterprise focused on the engine of customer value, all 
those within an enterprise need to adapt and play their role.
For those in this group, I often start by offering an Agile 101 session, which 
includes an emphasis on the Agile values and principles and a view of the 
Agile galaxy highlighting both axes. I focus on what it means to be customer-
value-driven. Next, in the spirit of self-organizing, I ask the participants 
how they think they can adapt their role to align with the Agile mindset and 
the incremental nature it brings and how they can contribute to delivering 
customer value. Consider reading Chapter 9 for addition education options 
and guidance. The roles or functional areas that tend to fall into the “less 
obvious” grouping include:
Customers
A customer is someone who has a choice on what to buy and where to buy 
it. By purchasing your product, a customer pays you with money to help your 
company stay in business. Because of these facts, engaging the customer is of 
utmost importance. Customers are external to the company and may provide 
the initial ideas and feedback to validate the ideas into working products.
While not always obvious, the customer role should be front and center when 
working in an Agile context. Your customers are your business partners and 
your goal is to build strong customer relationships. While customers should 
be invited to product demonstrations and provide feedback, they should 
really be asked for their opinions all along the idea journey from identification 
to delivery to the reflection of customer value. For more information on 
customers, see Chapter 6.

The Agile Enterprise
85
Executives and Senior Management
Executives and senior management establish company goals, strategies, and 
objectives, and they provide leadership and guidance.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, senior leaders must initiate a 
strategic shift in how the enterprise works. The senior leader should become 
the sponsor of the Agile initiative, encouraging buy-in to Agile. They must 
play a continuous role in advocating for Agile via e-mails, company meetings, 
and celebrations. Executives learn the language of Agile and customer value 
and become more conversant with those they lead.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Senior management may only have one person on its team who has sponsored 
the Agile change; others may not yet be on the Agile bandwagon.
Executives should support the concept of customer-value-driven enterprise, 
advocating for a discovery mindset where customer feedback loops are used to 
incrementally gain an understanding of what is valuable to the customer. They 
should also advocate for metrics that gain insight into learning what the customer 
value is and the fastest possible speed for delivering that customer value.
Senior leaders should adapt the enterprise from hierarchical to self-
organizing. When employees feel they have more ownership and decision-
making accountability, they apply more brainpower and bring passion to their 
work. This should include hiring direct reports who have a discovery mindset 
while retraining current directs who have a certainty mindset.
Business Leaders (Including Marketing and Sales)
The business department, including marketing and sales, focuses on developing 
products and services that meet customer needs. They focus on customer 
value by understanding current demand, marketplace trends, competition, 
brand value, and overall customer needs. The best product owners come 
from the business side and its employees can be an effective part of a PO 
constellation.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, the business side (specifically 
the product owners) becomes the driver for capturing customer value. All 
those on the business side should learn Agile, embrace the discovery mindset, 
and begin to operate in more of an incremental manner. Roles in this space 
should be no more than two degrees of separation from the customer. All 
business personnel associated with a product should attend demonstrations 
as products evolve.

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise
86
Middle Management
Traditionally, middle managers carry out the strategic vision of executives, 
create effective work environments, coordinate and control the work, and 
supervise groups of people who do the work. They may have functional and 
technical ownership of products. They also provide performance management 
and career development to their people.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, middle managers must build a 
healthy Agile culture by encouraging their teams to align with Agile values and 
principles and focus on being customer-value-driven. They must adapt and act as a 
coach and servant leader toward their teams and become less directive. They must 
trust their teams to make good decisions, establish bounded authority, create safe 
work environments, and remove employee and team roadblocks. They should 
focus on the optimal location of people that reduces impediments and enables the 
flow of work. They should promote career and personal development through 
continuous education and apply Agile-minded performance excellence.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Middle managers must adapt their role by backing away from their functional 
leadership since the PO now owns much of that work.
If middle managers have strong product knowledge, some functional 
management members shift their roles and become a PO since the PO now 
owns the product direction. Because of less functional responsibility of their 
teams, some managers may evolve from a functional manager to a resource 
or career manager.
Middle managers are often the lynchpin that allows the executive’s vision for 
Agile to thrive in the team setting. If they embrace Agile, then the change 
may succeed. Otherwise, they can block the change toward an Agile culture 
if they feel the need for control and won’t allow a team to self-organize.
Human Resources
Human resource (HR) departments focus on managing company processes, 
policies, and standards, while carrying out management programs that focus 
on employees. More specifically, HR engages in recruitment, employee 
relationships, performance management, corporate communications, employee 
benefits, and pay structures.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, HR can help build a healthy 
Agile culture that optimizes for engaged and happy employees. HR should 
be knowledgeable in Agile and what it means to be a customer-value-driven 
enterprise. HR should promote the values of collaboration, ownership, 
motivation, empowerment, trust, and safety (COMETS) for employees.

The Agile Enterprise
87
HR should recruit those candidates with an Agile mindset and align 
performance management from individuals to teams. HR works to adapt all 
roles toward an Agile mindset as described in this chapter and, in particular, 
to move management toward a coaching and servant leader role. For more 
on evolving HR to be more Agile, see Chapter 21.
Finance
Finance employees are primarily responsible for the fiscal health of an 
organization. They are focused on the financial side of funding decisions, 
facilities support, and staffing and, as a result, they manage the supply-
and-demand system of the organization. A specific activity undertaken by 
finance is managing the annual budget process and periodically reporting and 
monitoring the financial health of the enterprise.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, budgeting departments 
should adapt to a continuous Agile budgeting or at least a quarterly budgeting 
cycle. Finance needs to understand the importance of customer feedback 
and how it can change the direction of customer value to better know where 
to invest the enterprise’s money. Since the demand for certain products and 
services can change quickly, finance needs to establish a system that can adapt 
supply according to the demands of the customer and market conditions.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Business (including marketing and sales) and finance become stewards of 
capturing customer value, embracing the discovery mindset, operating in an incremental manner, 
and applying customer feedback, all of which lead to better business outcomes.
For healthier decision making, finance should participate in two activities 
related to the value of ideas. The first is to challenge the assumptions and 
certainty thinking being demonstrated when people say an idea is of high value. 
The second is to advocate for Agile budgeting where the company funds only 
increments of an idea to place smaller bets and ensure that feedback is collected 
before any further funding. In addition, finance should adapt reporting toward 
a more incremental and outcome-driven manner. Finally, finance should learn 
Agile and what it means to be a customer-value-driven enterprise. For more 
on finance and their role in Agile budgeting, see Chapter 19.
Portfolio Management
Portfolio management (PM) teams focus on identifying what work is deemed 
valuable to an organization. These teams are found near the early part of 
the delivery axis of the Agile galaxy. In a more general sense, PM is a group 

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise
88
within an organization that defines the standards of how the portfolio or 
work is managed. Traditionally, these employees are often involved in having 
authority and making decisions on what work gets done. PM often supplies 
metrics and reporting on the progress of the work.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, PM should move toward 
a servant leader role. These employees adapt from being a key decision 
maker to enabling effective decision making by the business side. They set 
up an enterprise pipeline of ideas being considered or those that are already 
underway, focusing on the value of the work instead of the status. Information 
on the enterprise idea pipeline should be publically available.
PM can be instrumental in supporting a customer-value-driven organization 
by providing transparency on how the work has gotten prioritized, what 
prioritization methods have been used, what assumptions have been made, 
what customer feedback loops have been applied to validate customer value, 
and what team(s) have or may be involved in the work.
PM should also encourage a discovery and incremental mindset that, instead of 
moving a large idea into development, promotes the activity of decomposing 
an increment of the idea to validate its value. It should also adapt reporting 
toward recognizing value delivered, rate of delivery, quality of delivery, and 
business outcomes of revenue generated. Of course, PM should learn Agile 
and what it means to be customer-value-driven.
Project Management Office (PMO)
The project management office (PMO) focuses on defining project standards 
and supporting projects in the latter part of the delivery axis of the Agile 
galaxy. Traditionally, the PMO is directly involved in managing projects and 
often supply project managers to lead them. PMOs supply output metrics and 
report on the status of projects. They may initiate project status meetings to 
determine how projects are doing.
When moving toward Agile and customer focus, there may be a significant 
shift in how the PMO operates. Since most work in Agile is facilitated by a 
ScrumMaster with the Product Owner deciding the value and priority of the 
work, there is less work for a project manager to do. It is not uncommon for 
some project managers to become ScrumMasters, depending on their ability 
to adapt to an Agile mindset and act as a coach and facilitator.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  If you have a portfolio and/or project management office, the focus should be 
less on decision making and more on servant leadership for enabling customer value.

The Agile Enterprise
89
It is not uncommon for a PMO to adapt to a leaner AMO (Agile management 
office). In an Agile environment, the focus is not the project, but the 
incremental delivery of value. Establishing a project implies you can know 
customer value upfront. In Agile, the team creates increments of value 
and the PO collects customer feedback used to adapt the product toward 
customer value. While the PMO may be leaner due to the ScrumMaster and 
PO, the PMO may focus on managing bigger releases where multiple teams 
are required to build the product.
As the PMO adapts to an Agile culture and processes, it should also adapt 
reporting toward understanding value delivered, speed of delivery, quality of 
delivery, and business outcomes of revenue generated. Of course, the PMO 
should learn Agile and what it means to be customer-value-driven.
The Importance of an Agile Coach
The Agile coach plays a big role in getting Agile off the ground. It can be 
beneficial to have a coach with enterprise Agile experience because he 
or she can help you navigate toward an Agile culture and the deep Agile 
implementation knowledge that ensures teams are implementing Agile 
effectively. While education will provide initial knowledge, a coach can keep 
you on the Agile path and prevent you from reverting back to old, traditional 
habits. The coach also understands the short-term and long-term pitfalls of 
adopting Agile and that Agile is a culture shift and will take time. The coach 
can help the team move to Agile in a more effective and efficient manner.
With that being said, it is important to gauge whether the Agile coach really 
understands Agile and what levels he or she has operated in (for example, 
team, management, and enterprise). As a tip, ask perspective coaches if they 
can articulate and discuss the Agile values and principles (without referring 
to a book or the Internet). Ask them what level(s) they have coached. For 
each level, ask them what challenges they have encountered and how they 
overcame them.
Bounded Authority
As you move to an enterprise where employees are engaged and teams 
self-organize around work, there is a benefit to providing guidance on the 
boundaries of the various roles and their activities. Instead of approaching 
this by trial and error where teams bump into the boundaries with often 
negative consequences, consider applying the concept of bounded authority.

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise
90
Bounded authority is defined by the sphere of responsibility determined by 
who has the most knowledge and experience over a particular aspect of work. 
Those people should have the authority and decision-making rights over that 
work. For example, the group having the most knowledge about enterprise 
strategy is senior management. The group having the most knowledge about 
designing and building a product is the team.
Within a hierarchical structure of a company, bounded authority can help 
at multiple levels. For simplicity, Figure 8-4 illustrates team-level, middle-
management-level, and senior-management-level boundaries. You may also 
add functional areas such as HR and finance.

Bounded Authority
Figure 8-4.  Bounded authority to help with self-organization
Within an Agile context, the goal is to push ownership and the authority 
and decision making it brings to the lowest possible level where the most 
information and experience dwells. For an Agile team, the members self-
organize around the work in the product backlog that has been prioritized by 
the PO. Once that work is available at the team level, the team has authority 
to make architecture, design coding, and test decisions, and it can self-organize 
around how to build the product.
The key to bounded authority is that each level knows what work it should 
self-organize, what it is empowered to change, and the areas in which it 
can make decisions. Another key is that each level knows the authority of 
another level. Equally important is that this implies what authority a level 
does not have.

The Agile Enterprise

■
■Agile Pit Stop  Within an Agile context, the goal is to push authority and decision making of 
the work to the lowest possible level where the most information and experience dwells.
If the team’s work is prioritized by the product owner, what does middle 
management do? Can they assign work to the team? The short answer is no 
since the team gets their work from the PO via the product backlog. While 
the team self-organizes around the work, middle management helps optimize 
flow for their teams by removing impediments and enabling the teams to be 
its most effective.
Senior management should be focusing on the work where they have the 
most knowledge and experience. Their bounded authority of work may be 
to provide a strategy for the enterprise. This means they must help teams 
understand strategy and help them align strategy with their work.
Another option is the concept of seven levels of delegation where the bounded 
authority guidance is at the activity level instead of the role level. Established 
by Jurgen Appelo, this concept expands the binary view of authority of a 
decision (for example, you have authority or I have authority) into seven 
levels of delegation. They are the following: tell, sell, consult, agree, advise, 
inquire, and delegate.
As you may guess, on one end of the spectrum “tell” means that the manager 
fully owns the decision, and on the other end “delegate” means the decision 
is fully owned by the team while not even telling the manager the outcome. 
The value of this model is that some managers are not ready to give total 
authority of the decision away, so they may incrementally move to a less 
authoritative position (for instance, from tell to consult) where the manager 
now asks for input before making a discussion. You can learn more about the 
seven levels of delegation in Managing for Happiness.1
BOUNDED AUTHORITY EXERCISE
Create a bounded authority map similar to Figure 8-4. Include executive, middle 
management, product owner, and team. Create two columns below each role (for 
example, the current and traditional context and what an Agile context might look 
like). For each context, determine what activities along the delivery axis (such as 
identify value, prioritize value, develop value, and deliver value) each role owns. 
Compare each context. What differences do you see?

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise

Healthy Employee Relationships
A big part of building an Agile enterprise is evolving roles to better connect 
people together. Promote activities where employees can interact, build 
empathy, and collaborate. Sharing each other’s delights and concerns is a 
meaningful way to build understanding and trust. In Agile, there are many 
related practices that promote people working together (for instance, pair 
programming, story mapping, and grooming). Informal activities, such as 
eating and socializing together, can further the connection.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Sharing each other’s delights and concerns is a good way to build trust and 
understanding.
Strong connections occur when two people bond in a face-to-face 
manner. Since nonverbal communication makes up a major portion of all 
communication, face-to-face communication helps people better understand 
each other and how they are feeling about a discussion. While physical face-
to-face contact is preferred, there are online applications that bring you face-
to-face. Consider using a virtual alternative when physical face-to-face is not 
an option.
It is not uncommon in a distributed organization to have members at the 
remote site visit and bond with team members at the local site. This is a way 
to get team members to know each other, which promotes collaboration 
and builds trust. When members return to their designated site, the trust 
that has been built will promote stronger relationships.
Healthy Manager-to-Employee Relationships
As you look at the various trust relationships, an important connection 
is between an employee and his or her direct manager. Managers are 
responsible for maintaining a healthy and happy workplace. Managers need to 
make extra efforts to build trust with their employees and promote an open 
and honest workplace. As a manager, consider ways you can get to know 
team members and they can get to know you. Key ingredients in building 
trust are transparency, listening, integrity, and growth.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  To build healthy relationships between managers and their employees, apply 
transparency, listening, integrity, and growth to the relationship.

The Agile Enterprise
93
Transparency is about sharing information regarding the company, division, 
and group so employees know what is going on. This may include sharing the 
latest changes, strategy, group goals, and anything else that has an impact 
on employees. When trust is established, transparency becomes a two-
way street. As a manager shares more, employees will share more with the 
manager about what is really going on around them.
Listening is allowing employees to lead the agenda in a one-to-one encounter. 
By being an active listener, you have the opportunity to learn about the 
employees and what they care about. Another example of listening is walking 
the gemba (in other words, the real place where work gets done) where 
employees are sitting. Stop by and say hello. Ask them if there is anything 
they need.
Integrity is about being fair and honest with the way you treat employees and 
avoiding favoritism. Deliver on commitments to employees and only promise 
something when you mean to do it. If you ask employees to take risks, provide 
them a safe environment to do so. If you respond negatively to an employee 
failure, this will be a sure way to lose trust. Instead, address what was learned 
(focus on the positive) and how that learning can be incorporated for better 
results in the future.
Growth is about showing employees that you care about their personal 
goals and career growth. This goes well beyond the notion of promotions 
by providing them learning opportunities both within the workplace and 
outside. Periodically check in to discuss their goals to see how they are doing.
Holocracy
When considering how to evolve roles to align for the changing needs of 
customers, you may look at the holocracy model. Holocracy can be defined as 
a different way of operating an enterprise that moves power from a hierarchy 
management structure and distributes it across autonomous teams, as 
illustrated in Figure 8-5. Holocracy has clear rules and definitions for what 
teams and individuals can do.

Chapter 8 | Evolving Roles in Your Agile Enterprise
94
In holocracy, teams are the basic components and building blocks of an 
enterprise. Teams are given a consequential purpose and then self-organize 
around the work and determine how to best achieve the need. Teams are 
not part of a business unit. This allows for dynamic movement of teams and 
individuals toward the work of perceived high customer value.
From a customer-value perspective, teams have customer value as their 
driving consequential purpose. As customers’ needs change, so do the 
teams. Because team members have a number of skills and experience, they 
may move from team to team to where the highest value work is occurring.
Holocracy leverages a number of concepts. Transparency is applied where 
strategy, policies, and decisions are made public so you don’t need to rely on 
the politics of who you know to get information. Self-organizing teams are 
responsible for their work, decide how to do their work, and determine who 
will do the work without any managerial input.
Lightning-bolt-shaped teams ensure team members have a primary, secondary, 
and tertiary skill set, experience, or ability to work on different types of 
work to make it easier to move from team to team. Bounded authority 
is applied where ownership and decision making is moved to where the 
most knowledge lives, which is often at the team level. Also, the concepts of 
open source, Agile processes, and lean enterprise are often seen as part of 
holocratic organizations.
Enterprises that move to a holocracy model will see their organizations’ 
structure adapt to allow for more teams working on customer value and 
more employees who are closer to the customer. The two-degrees-of 
customer-separation rule (where every employee is no more than two 
degrees of separation from the customer) almost becomes automatic.
Figure 8-5.  Hierarchical and holocracy structures

The Agile Enterprise
95
It may be challenging for some employees, including those in management, 
to move to an holocracy model. I suggest first experiencing self-organizing 
and applying lightning-bolt-shaped teams before considering holocracy. 
For more insight, consider exploring Holocracy by Brian J. Robertson, The 
Evolutionary-Teal Paradigm by Frederic Laloux, and the Agile mindset on how 
an organization may evolve to be better align with customer value.
Have You Evolved Your Roles Yet?
It does take an enterprise and the whole Agile galaxy to move to Agile and 
the focus on customer value. Every role should evolve to become closer to 
customer value. If you are an Agile enterprise, you should see new roles, 
adaptation to existing roles, and the minimization of other roles. Avoid 
optimizing on the title of the role and instead optimize on what is needed to 
more effectively deliver customer value.

Building a 
Learning 
Enterprise
Education is more than training. It includes coaching, mentoring, experiencing, 
experimenting, and giving back.
—Mario Moreira
In today’s fast-paced life where everything is changing around us and advancing 
toward new technology, processes, and cultures, it is important that you give 
yourself the opportunity to learn. Learning allows you to stay current with the 
latest trends and directions of your industry and allows you to incorporate 
new concepts, technologies, and practices to your work.
Enter the continuous learning Agile enterprise. This is an enterprise that 
understands that it is the people (both employees and customers) that will 
make them more successful. The Agile manifesto reminds us of this by empha-
sizing “individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” Educate the 
individuals and they can help adapt the enterprise. It is important to remem-
ber that employees are the mechanics of the customer-value-driven engine. 
Educate them in the ways of Agile and customer value and they will help the 
enterprise succeed.

Chapter 9 | Building a Learning Enterprise
98
A continuous learning enterprise also understands that you can learn from 
a variety of difference sources in a variety of different ways. This enterprise 
believes that there is no end state for being Agile just as there is no end state 
to learning what is valuable to the customer. Just as teams should have a con-
sequential purpose to help them focus on their work, an enterprise should 
have a consequential purpose to help it realize the variety of education that 
can help with that purpose.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  There is no final destination for being Agile just as there is no end state to 
learning what is valuable to the customer. Both are adapted over time.
As illustrated in Figure 9-1, the consequential purpose of achieving customer 
value helps an enterprise focus its culture, process, skills, and roles education. 
Since Agile is an enabler to delivering customer value, Agile topics form the 
core of the education needed to deliver customer value.

Because Agile requires a cultural shift in the way you think about work, you 
need to first ready your mind by learning the Agile values and principles and 
the importance of focusing on positive business outcomes. You also need 
to understand the cultural shifts necessary for the Agile journey. Then you 
must learn the various Agile processes, practices, and skills needed to make 
the journey. Finally, you need to be joined by a guide (that is, a coach) who 
can help you transform to an Agile mindset as you experience and learn what 
Agile feels like. Of course, as you work through continuous learning, you need 
to gain feedback and adapt to people’s educational needs.
Education Is More than Training
Does your Agile education begin and end with a touch of training? A number 
of colleagues have told me that their Agile training was completed in one hour, 
one day, or two days, and then they were expected to apply and master the 
topics. Agile isn’t simply a process or skill that can be memorized and applied. 
Will such limited training time suffice for a transformation to Agile? Probably 
not, as insufficient training time limits the success of effectively implementing 
Agile.
Education is an investment in your people. A shift in culture requires an incre-
mental learning approach that spans across time. What works in one com-
pany doesn’t work in another. Education should be an intrinsic part of your 
Agile transformation that includes skills, roles, process, culture, and behavior 
education with room to experience and experiment.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Continuous learning is more than event-driven training. It is reading, coaching, 
mentoring, experiencing, experimenting, and giving back on a continuous basis.
When you want to adapt your enterprise culture, you need education that 
includes more than just skill building. Culture change is a transformation that 
involves the most change and requires the most time for an organization 
to adapt. To support that change, there are educational elements that are 
suited for achieving the Agile skills, roles, processes, and culture as illustrated 
in Figure 9-2. These elements include training, mentoring, coaching, experi-
encing, experimenting, reflecting, and giving back. These education elements 
should be included in your culture change.

Chapter 9 | Building a Learning Enterprise
100
Training is applied when an enterprise wants to build employee skills, educate 
employees in their roles, or roll out a process. It is often event-driven and a 
one-way transfer of knowledge. What was learned can be undone when you 
move back into your existing culture, and it can be forgotten if not applied 
quickly. Coaching can reaffirm the training. Also, training can occur in an 
instructor-led manner where it is scheduled or in a web-based manner where 
the material is pre-recorded and can be used on demand.
Reading allows individuals to focus on topics of their own interest and at their 
own pace, but it does require self-motivation. Readers can use a physical book 
or e-book. The reading often includes articles, journals, podcasts, and blogs. 
Reading offers the advantage of going back to the source of the article, chap-
ter, or section. Reading can also be done in with the aid of book clubs where 
teams or groups read and then discuss a topic.
Coaching helps a team put the knowledge of process and roles into action and 
lays the groundwork for transforming the culture. Coaching provides a two-
way communication process so that questions can be asked along the way. If 
you do not have a coach, it is very easy to apply a process incorrectly or give 
up and revert to the old process. A coach has been on this journey before and 
can help you until you are enacting the process or practice correctly with the 
right behaviors for the culture you want.
Mentoring focuses on relationships and building confidence and self-percep-
tion. The person being mentored (mentee) invests time by proposing topics to 
be discussed in the relationship. In this two-way communication, deep learn-
ing can occur because the mentee is asking questions and seeking answers 
without being prompted. Mentoring allows individuals within an enterprise to 
better understand their place in the culture.

Experiencing focuses on living in the new process, applying the skills, and expe-
riencing the new roles. This provides individuals with first-hand knowledge 
of what they’ve learned, allowing them to better understand the behavior 
changes needed. It allows for deeper questions, further exploration, and 
experimentation.
Experimenting focuses on trying something new for a short period of time 
in order to test a proposed change. The change often begins with a hypoth-
esis on what might work better and then is crafted into a short test to see 
if the new idea had the effect or improvement set out by the hypothesis. 
Experimenting is a way to try concepts and practices before fully committing 
to a change.
Reflecting focuses on taking the time to consider what you learned—whether 
it is a skill, process, role, or culture—and determine what you can do better 
and what else you need on your learning journey. In effect, it is similar to an 
Agile retrospective that can occur at the employee, team, or enterprise level. 
It is a feedback loop to consider where you’ve been and what you need to 
achieve an Agile culture and a customer-value-driven enterprise.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  When you get employees willing to give back to their community, it indicates 
a movement where employees are committed to the Agile transformation.
Giving back occurs when the employees have gained enough knowledge, skills, 
and experience to start giving back to their community. It is a commitment to 
start helping others. This provides a feeling of ownership in a transformation 
of the culture. Giving back can be to the company, local community, or greater 
community.
It takes a repertoire of educational elements to achieve an Agile culture. 
These elements help a team develop skills, learn its roles, navigate a process, 
and grasp behavioral changes toward achieving an Agile mindset. Ensure you 
apply a repertoire to your learning.
Agile Education Universe
There is a wealth of topics that can be covered in achieving an Agile mindset 
and customer value as illustrated in Figure 9-1. In an Agile galaxy context, you 
can learn about the early part of the delivery life cycle where ideas get articu-
lated and prioritized, processes are applied, and motivation and trust become 
a priority. What you can learn is limitless.

Chapter 9 | Building a Learning Enterprise
102
Since learning is a journey, you may apply different education elements, depend-
ing on the topic. For some Agile topics, looking at a topic from several differ-
ent angles enables learners to fully digest and understand it. Also there are 
certain core topics that can be building blocks in achieving an Agile culture. 
This is why I strongly recommend avoiding process and role topics up front 
and instead focus on topics that can ready the mind for an Agile culture.
Agile Education to Ready the Mind
Since Agile requires a cultural change, consider starting your Agile transfor-
mation by focusing on the current culture of the company. Begin readying the 
mind by educating employees on Agile values and principles and the behavioral 
changes needed. When you start with Agile mechanics of processes or roles, 
people may think Agile is first about mechanics and then the achievement of 
an Agile mindset.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Focus early Agile education on topics that begin the cultural changes such as 
Agile values and principles, discovery mindset, and self-organizing teams.
I often start an Agile transformation by offering an Agile 101 session that 
emphasizes the Agile values and principles. I ask employees to rank order the 
Agile values to initiate discussion and thinking. Then I’ll walk through each 
Agile principle and ask them if they agree, are neutral, or disagree with it. If 
people are neutral or disagree, discussion and debate will ensue. I’ll only spend 
five minutes on each principle as the purpose isn’t to persuade employees, but 
to have a discussion. Sometimes a mindset shift takes time, so don’t rush it.
After Agile 101, I continue with a session that focuses on the Agile galaxy 
with an emphasis of both axes, and what a customer-value-driven enterprise 
means. I’ll ask where on the galaxy most people are applying Agile today so the 
participants better understand the state of their Agile galaxy. Next, I’ll discuss 
the discovery mindset and behaviors that may be expected. This will include 
a focus on self-organizing and bounded authority.
You may notice in the early Agile education, I have not once mentioned edu-
cation on an Agile process or Agile role. Instead, focus early on readying the 
mind for Agile with Agile mindset education.

The Agile Enterprise
103
Topics in the Agile Education Universe
There is a wealth of Agile education on the market. Much of it focuses on Agile 
processes and roles. While this is an important part of your Agile journey, 
ensure your education includes a strong focus on the Agile culture and the 
behaviors necessary to achieve an Agile mindset. Also focus on education that 
provides knowledge regarding the delivery of customer value.
In searching for education topics, I’ve been impressed with the Value, Flow, 
Quality (VFQ)1 curriculum. While VFQ includes a focus on Agile processes 
and roles, it primarily covers many of the concepts that get to the heart of 
effectively running an Agile enterprise. VFQ focuses on topics to help you 
increase value through delivering early and often, optimizing the end-to-end 
flow for faster delivery, and enhancing feedback through fast feedback loops. 
Here are some of the topics that VFQ covers:
Why Change?
Delivering (Value)  
Early and Often
Optimizing Flow
Feedback
Teams
Motivation
Collaboration
Communication
Understanding Your  
Customer
Requirements
Prioritization
Estimating and 
Forecasting
Trade-Offs
Batch Size Matters
Work in Progress
Attacking Your 
Queues
In addition, there are a number of topics that go well beyond Agile processes 
and roles and should be considered when building an Agile culture and focus-
ing on delivering customer value. They include the following:

These two tables provide over 50 topics beyond Agile roles and processes, and 
there are certainly hundreds more. Getting educated on these topics helps 
you gain a more thorough understanding of how to apply Agile for your team 
or for the Agile galaxy that represents your enterprise. The topics shared in 
this book may get you farther along in your Agile journey, knowing there is 
more to learn.
Finally, irrespective of the education you receive on Agile topics, I strongly recom-
mend that you periodically revisit the Agile values and principles. As people gain 
more experience in Agile, they may grasp the Agile values and principles more 
fully over time. The one change I make for advanced learners in the Agile values 
and principles education is that instead of the instructor explaining the Agile 
principles, I ask the advanced students to explain them to the class. Then I ask 
the class if the explanations were accurate and clear. Let the discussion begin!

The Agile Enterprise
105
Importance of Work-Based Learning
Work-based learning is an approach to education where for every topic that 
you learn, you must apply the knowledge. This supports the discovery mindset 
and provides a deeper level of learning for students. The first-hand experience 
gained by students provides a deeper learning environment.
Within the Value, Flow, Quality (VFQ) education, Alex Adamopoulos includes 
the work-based approach to education, which helps organizations learn Agile 
and business topics and then gain immediate business benefits from applying 
them. Students learn a topic, exercise the topic in class, and then apply the 
topic with their team members in their actual working environment.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Work-based learning moves beyond theory and asks you to apply what you 
learned into your real working environment.
A similar approach is the learn-apply-share model, which includes learning 
a topic in the classroom, applying it in exercises, using it in a real work set-
ting, and finally sharing and explaining the topic to others. When you have to 
explain a topic to others, you more fully understand the topic, which deepens 
your learning opportunity.
When you expand the notion of continuous learning, not only do you learn 
Agile topics, you also “learn your way to customer value.” A learning enter-
prise goes beyond learning processes and tools. The type of enterprise that 
uses this approach recognizes that you learn from each other and you learn 
from your customers. Just as it takes a discovery mindset with multiple cus-
tomer feedback loops to zero in on customer value, it takes multiple types of 
Agile topics to operate in an Agile manner to achieve customer value.
Agile Education Vision
Agile is a cultural shift that is often larger than most people realize. As you 
look to change your culture and gain the business benefits, you have learned 
in this chapter that there are hundreds of Agile and customer value related 
topics. You have also learned there are many ways to become educated. So, 
how do you organize Agile education in a manageable way?
Enter the Agile Education Vision. This vision is an adaptive education roadmap 
where you can iteratively plan and apply the repertoire of topics and educa-
tional elements to support your transformation toward an Agile culture. The 
vision can be applied to an employee, a team, and/or an enterprise.

Chapter 9 | Building a Learning Enterprise
106
■
■Agile Pit Stop  An Agile education vision is your backlog of educational topics that you can 
iteratively plan and apply to support your transformation toward an Agile culture.
You may consider an Agile education vision as a prioritized product backlog of 
education topics based on needs. In each iteration, some form of education is 
provided that builds Agile knowledge, skills, and capabilities toward achieving 
an Agile mindset. At the beginning of each iteration, topics may be added and 
reprioritized for what is most important at that time.
• 
When applied at an individual employee level, ask what 
education may help a person develop the skills, process, 
and experience to better grasp Agile and understand how 
to achieve customer value. An employee may have per-
sonal learning goals such as gaining more knowledge on 
story point sizing and gaining new experiences by meet-
ing actual customers.
• 
When applied at a team level, ask what education may 
help employees improve Agile teamwork and the flow of 
their work? A team may have goals focused on collabora-
tion or learning to decompose work from user story to 
task. In the spirit of self-organizing teams, the Agile educa-
tion vision is meant to be self-organized by the teams and 
their education needs.
• 
When applied at the enterprise level, ask what education 
can help the organization shift toward an Agile mindset 
and be more customer-value-driven by aligning roles 
more closely to the customer. This may start with basic 
Agile education that all employees should have such as 
Agile values and principles. An enterprise may then focus 
on applying self-organizing teams and applying the discov-
ery mindset to meet customer needs.
As an added tip, any time an education item is time-consuming (one-day train-
ing, reading a book, and so), consider including it as a story with a story point 
value. As the owner works on this item, the story card can get moved across 
the board to indicate progress of the education. This highlights that education 
is considered valuable and illustrates the progress made in completing the 
education work item.
How will your teams be educated? An accumulation of education elements 
at different points in time will provide the comprehensive focus to help you, 
your team, and your organization. Consider applying a self-organized educa-
tion vision that best serves your goal toward being Agile. You want to create 
a self-organizing education culture where employees are eager to learn, act, 
and give back to their community.

The Agile Enterprise
107
AGILE EDUCATION VISION EXERCISE
As you consider your individual education needs, document what Agile education you 
have had to date. Now review the two tables of topics in “Topics in the Agile Education 
Universe” section. Identify at least three topics you would like to learn more about. If 
you are sufficiently motivated, consider working with your team to do the same (for 
example, document what education the team has had and identify at least three topics 
that the team would like to learn more about). Now act on getting education on one of 
the topics within the next two weeks.
Building an Agile Community
Another form of education involves engaging the broader Agile community. 
Building an Agile community creates a continuous online and physical pres-
ence of Agile support. It provides a platform where employees collaborate 
with and educate each other. The platform encourages sharing progress and 
success stories. It provides employees the opportunity to share knowledge 
and give back to their community. Some building blocks for a healthy Agile 
community may include the following:
• 
A website to share practices with the community. When an 
Agile culture has been established, information such as 
culture, processes, glossary, pointers to education, and 
more are placed on the company Agile website so that 
teams have ready access to this information moving 
forward.
• 
A venue for online social collaboration among the community. 
This provides an online space for those on the Agile jour-
ney to pose questions to those outside of their teams to 
hear their thoughts, ideas, and lessons learned as well as 
to provide answers to others who are posing questions. 
This space provides an opportunity to discuss and col-
laborate on a variety of topics. It is also a place to share 
internal blog articles.
• 
A venue for live forums for the community. This is a place 
to host the latest advances in Agile by Agile coaches or 
where Agile champions can give back to the local com-
munity. These venues may include seminars and webinars 
as platforms to share the latest progress or support for 
Agile by leaders.

ing mindset can help people understand that there is a lot to learn and that 
the knowledge gained can only help your enterprise succeed. It takes a reper-
toire of educational elements to achieve an Agile culture. An accumulation of 
education elements at different points in time will provide the comprehensive 
focus to help you, your team, and your enterprise.
Consider establishing an iterative and adaptable Agile education vision for 
yourself, your team, and your enterprise that best serves your goal for an 
Agile transformation and the delivery of customer value. Ultimately, you want 
to create a self-organizing learning culture where employees are willing and 
eager to learn new topics and make themselves and their enterprise more 
successful.

Applying a 
Discovery 
Mindset
The best way to recognize customer value is to be open to discovery.
—Mario Moreira
Bold moves in space exploration occurred because we dared to discover 
what lies beyond our world. Prior to our journeys into space, there were 
discoveries of unknown places on earth made by Portuguese, Italian, English, 
Spanish, Norse, Dutch, and Chinese explorers, among others. In our desire 
to discover the unknown and manage risks, a discovery mindset was applied.
The Portuguese didn’t get to India on their first sailing trip, but, instead, each 
expedition ventured just a bit farther than the previous one. This allowed 
what was learned to travel back to Portugal. There, cartographers updated 
maps with the new information the explorers provided about the landscape, 
sea hazards, tides, details of the local flora and fauna, and sailing lanes for the 
next expedition.
People involved in space exploration had similar experiences. The moon 
wasn’t reached the first time humans broke through the earth’s atmosphere.

Instead, attempts where made to go a little farther into the universe with each 
rocket launch, testing the capability of the technology along the way. During 
the exploration of both the earth and space, a variety of innovations occurred, 
making it possible to get to the next leg of the journey.
A discovery mindset is a belief that acknowledges uncertainty and applies a 
variety of thinking approaches to continuously learn through incrementally 
gathering knowledge of what lies beyond. This includes a combination of 
a curiosity to learn and a drive to innovate. A discovery mindset isn’t one 
where you voyage haphazardly about, but, instead, apply methodical concepts 
that lead to a more informed journey.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  A discovery mindset is a belief that acknowledges uncertainty and applies a 
variety of thinking approaches to continuously learn what lies beyond.
A discovery mindset leads with establishing behaviors of learning as we go, 
focusing on what we don’t know, and using various thinking approaches to 
gain knowledge toward the direction of customer value. A discovery mindset 
avoids certainty thinking as well as upfront and big-batch approaches.
Discovery Mindset for Business
From a business perspective, the discovery mindset ensures that you are not 
using your funding and investment toward a path of false certainty, but rather 
heading toward a path where you learn the direction. You course-correct 
when you discover that you are headed in the wrong direction.
Using a discovery mindset has four primary benefits. The first benefit is that 
it helps you adapt toward the direction of customer value and (hopefully) 
product success. The second is that it helps with innovative work because 
less is known at the beginning so discovery of customer value becomes more 
important. The third is that, in relation to a transformation (since discovery 
involves working in increments), it can be much easier for people to commit 
to a short-term experiment than to commit to a long-term, often unknown, 
future. The fourth benefit is that it helps move an enterprise toward an 
empirical and disciplined approach to work.
Enhancing the Culture with Discovery
In Chapter 5, I discussed the importance of activating an Agile culture within 
your Agile galaxy. This means all roles from team to management and opera-
tional roles (HR, finance, and so on) in all quadrants of the ­galaxy should 

The Agile Enterprise
111
embrace the Agile and discovery mindset. This enhances the third dimension 
of your Agile galaxy as illustrated in Figure 10-1.
It is within this third dimension of your Agile galaxy that the discovery mind-
set and thinking approaches belong. The discovery mindset complements the 
Agile cultural attributes of COMETS (Collaboration, Ownership, Motivation, 
Empowerment, Trust, and Safety) discussed in Chapter 7. While COMETS are 
attributes you want to see in the people within an Agile galaxy, the discovery 
mindset contains the approaches people can use to methodically learn what 
is valuable to the customer. The goal of both is to cultivate positive behav-
iors. The three-dimensional view can help you understand your starting point, 
where the discovery mindset is occurring, and where you need to focus.
Leading with a Discovery Mindset
Imagine that you started your Agile transformation with a discovery mindset 
and thinking approaches instead of mechanical practices. The advantage of 
leading with a focus on mindset is that it sets the tone for the behaviors that 
you are looking for in people. Additionally, it avoids the trap of people thinking 
that Agile is about mechanically applying Agile processes or practices.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Leading with a discovery mindset and thinking approaches sets the tone for 
the behaviors needed for an Agile culture and how to adapt toward customer value.
Figure 10-1. Third dimension of the Agile galaxy where the discovery mindset lives

Chapter 10 | Applying a Discovery Mindset
112
As discussed in Chapter 5, a mechanical implementation of Agile processes 
and practices tends to ignore the cultural aspects of Agile. Since Agile is a 
cultural change, consider starting your Agile transformation from a cultural 
perspective with a strong focus on the discovery mindset. Readying the mind 
with the discovery mindset, thinking approaches, and Agile values and prin-
ciples conditions the mind so that when processes and practices are applied, 
they are done so with the right behaviors.
What are some of the various thinking approaches that enable a discovery 
mindset? They are incremental thinking, experimental thinking, divergent and 
convergent thinking, feedback thinking, and design thinking. What shouldn’t 
surprise you is that these concepts are often applied in tandem to achieve the 
best results. For example, design thinking involves incremental and divergent 
thinking. Experimental thinking includes incremental thinking and feedback 
thinking. The discovery mindset embraces them all.
Incremental Thinking
Incremental thinking is an approach where you embrace thinking in small 
pieces and in short timeframes. Instead of making big bets with limited knowl-
edge, you take smaller bets and use what was learned in the current incre-
ment to course-correct your direction for the next increment. This reduces 
risk and prevents investment from going down the wrong path for too long.
In Agile, there are the concepts of iteration and increment. These two con-
cepts are confusing for some in that they are often used interchangeably while 
they are in fact different. An iteration is the period of time a team works to 
build something. In Scrum, the concept of a sprint is used to provide a team 
with a period of time (for instance, one to four weeks) to produce a deliver-
able. The deliverable from an iteration is termed an increment.
An increment is the outcome of an iteration and, if aligned with the Agile val-
ues and principles, should produce working software or product. As it relates 
to incremental thinking, the goal is to move away from big-batch delivery and 
instead think in smaller batches aligning with the Agile principle of “deliver 
working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, 
with a preference to the shorter timescale.” Figure 10-2 illustrates the incre-
mental thinking approach toward customer value.

The Agile Enterprise
113
Incremental thinking supports the concept of learning what the customer 
finds as valuable. Incremental thinking allows us to shed the dangerous atti-
tude of pretend or arrogant certainty and instead explore what the customer 
needs. Instead of fixing customer needs up front, you iteratively learn your 
way to what the customer finds valuable by building increments of product 
that the customer can inspect and provide feedback for.
Experimental Thinking
Experimental thinking is an approach where you embrace a more systematic 
way of navigating toward certainty. Instead of guessing, this type of thinking 
uses a scientific approach where you hypothesize your next move. It is meant 
to provide more rigorous methods toward identifying customer value.
As you consider customer needs at the beginning of a project, you are at the 
time where you have the least information or evidence of the need. Instead of 
guessing, you establish a hypothesis for the next increment of work based on 
the information currently available and what may be the right direction.
As illustrated in Figure 10-3, you conduct your experiment and apply measur-
able data and feedback loops (that is, validating with customer demonstrations 
and more) to identify what you have learned. The results provide you knowl-
edge and help you determine where to go next by either affirming or rejecting 
the hypothesis. Then you take what was learned into the next incremental 
experiment where adaptation occurs.

In the context of a business or new product idea, a discovery mindset helps 
you systematically learn whether an idea has value to your customers. Each 
change—whether a new feature, a change to an existing feature, or removal 
of a feature—should start with a hypothesis.
Power of the Hypothesis
A hypothesis is an idea or supposition based on current evidence as your 
starting point. The ingredients of this hypothesis are a hypothesis statement 
related to a customer need, time-boxed iteration, and customer feedback to 
prove or disprove a direction. In other words, it should no longer be good 
enough to guess which direction you should move.
Any affirmation or rejection of a hypothesis is not meant to be a judgment. 
Instead, it should be looked at as a course-correction toward customer value. 
If you have hypothesized correctly, you may invest further effort into continu-
ing with the hypothesis. If you have not, create a new hypothesis based on the 
feedback received.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The best way to learn what the customer wants is by establishing a hypothesis 
and then running an experiment to determine if it is valid or not.
Drilling down, the elements of the hypothesis statement should include the 
change you are trying, the impact you expect from the change, and who should 
be impacted. The “change” should include the name of the change (feature, 
app, and so on). The “impact” should be quantifiable and data-driven involving 
an increase or decrease in a current measure. The “who” should include a

persona or market segment that is being targeted. You may also add a time-
frame for how long the test will run. Here are three examples:
• 
The new feature will be liked by 60% of our current user 
base in the next demonstration event.
• 
The new checkout design will decrease drop rates by 
30% for shoppers who have goods in shopping carts over 
the next 30 days.
• 
The new app will increase revenue by 10% for mobile app 
users over the next four weeks.
You should consider certainty-building activities as an experiment. It is impor-
tant to have a discovery mindset in all of the work you do, particularly when 
it comes to moving toward the direction of customer value.
Divergent and Convergent Thinking
Divergent thinking embraces an approach that promotes collaboration to 
generate ideas and numerous solutions with no censoring of ideas. Once an 
allocated time box to share and discuss ideas and options is concluded, diver-
gent thinking is paired with convergent thinking to more quickly come to 
consensus. This is illustrated in Figure 10-4.
A traditional divergent technique is brainstorming, which focuses on generat-
ing ideas in an unstructured manner. But due to the fast pace of most com-
panies, we are quick to shut down brainstorming by criticizing the opinions 
of others (including our own). Because of this, I recommend ten minutes of 
silence for all brainstorming activities to ensure all ideas get a chance to be 
revealed prior to any discussion.

People generate their ideas with no discussion so no one’s ideas are dismissed 
by people who are more assertive. As you may guess, often the quiet team 
members (that is, introverts) have great ideas and a divergent “quiet” period 
allows the talented introverts to get their ideas on the table. The key to diver-
gent thinking is that there is absolutely no censorship of ideas or solutions 
coming forth. All ideas are valuable.
Once the divergent time box is concluded, it is time to commence with con-
vergent thinking. Convergent thinking is an approach to systematically limit 
your options and focus on one direction. From divergent thinking, there are 
often more ideas and possible solutions than can be handled.
In convergence, various techniques can be applied to bring together ideas. 
This may include looking for affinities where common themes may arise from 
some of the ideas. It can also include red-dot voting, a non-confrontational 
prioritization technique where people quietly place their dots on what they 
think are the top ideas for solving the problem. Ideas with the largest number 
of dots are discussed until a top option is selected.
The value of divergent thinking cannot be underscored. Spending as little as 
a few hours of collaborative brainstorming coming up with ideas is a drop in 
the bucket compared to the thousands of hours spent in building a solution. 
The tiny investment is worth ensuring that many options are made available.
Also, the divergent and convergent pairing can occur in a continuous manner. 
For every customer need expressed in a user story in the beginning of an 
iteration or sprint, divergent thinking can be used in sprint planning to con-
sider options prior to jumping into the sprint where you build the customer 
need. When the next iteration or sprint begins, you move back to divergent 
thinking to consider options for the next set of user stories prior to embark-
ing on the sprint.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  It is important to be explicit about whether you are in a divergent or convergent 
thinking mode so people know if you are soliciting ideas or closing down options.
It is also very important to be explicit about whether you are in a divergent 
or convergent thinking mode. Some people naturally gravitate toward diver-
gence while others gravitate toward convergence. It can reduce tensions in 
interpersonal relationships to explicitly state whether you are in a divergent 
or convergent mode so that it is clear whether you are soliciting options or 
closing down options.
Finally, when you have an organization that is constantly pushing you to move 
forward, convergence is stressed, whether consciously or unconsciously. This 
is a detriment to innovation and being open to numerous possible solutions. 

The Agile Enterprise
117
It may take an organization to explicitly initiate divergent thinking to achieve 
more innovation and ideas.
DIVERGENT/CONVERGENT EXERCISE
Identify two people for a three-minute discussion on the topic of re-organizing desks 
in the department. Before starting, secretly instruct one person in the pair to think in 
a divergent mode where he or she attempts to brainstorm ideas and options of how 
the desks can be reorganized. Secretly instruct the other person in the pair to think 
in a convergent mode where he or she attempts to come up with one choice. Upon 
conclusion, ask the participants how the conversation went. Was it frustrating for 
them? Have they encountered this frustration before?
Feedback Thinking
Feedback thinking is the belief where you embrace feedback, realizing how 
it provides you with information that can guide you toward what is valu-
able. Collecting feedback can shatter the certainty mindset since feedback 
will often highlight differences in what is stated upfront as customer value and 
what a customer actually finds valuable. Key to feedback thinking is not just 
capturing customer feedback, but using it to adapt toward customer value.
Applying feedback thinking can be a big shift for some organizations that 
embrace a certainty mindset, don’t currently collect and apply customer 
feedback, or don’t intuitively understand the value it will provide in building 
products of customer value. Feedback thinking means that there is a perva-
sive need to collect customer feedback via feedback loops in as many areas 
across the delivery axis as possible, as illustrated in Figure 10-5.

Chapter 10 | Applying a Discovery Mindset
118
Feedback thinking brings in many voices to validate the direction through mul-
tiple feedback loops and is crucial to help course-correct toward customer 
value. The primary feedback collected should be from the actual customer. 
The customer is the most important voice in shaping the direction of the 
product. Customer feedback should be the basis for driving a majority of your 
decisions and setting the direction of customer value.
A benefit of feedback thinking is you gain real-time information on what the 
customer finds valuable since what customers find valuable changes over time. 
Incremental thinking along with feedback thinking to build customer value 
allows you not only to learn what the customer wants but also to gauge 
if there is a shift in the marketplace. This real-time data (in other words, 
­feedback) allows you to adapt to the ever-changing customer landscape.
Feedback thinking is an integral part of the discovery mindset. Feedback works 
well when paired with incremental thinking, experimental thinking, divergent 
and convergent thinking, and design thinking. To learn more about how to 
apply feedback thinking and put customer feedback into action, consider 
­reading Chapter 14.

FEEDBACK ON YOUR SPACESHIP EXERCISE
On a piece of paper, draw the best-looking spaceship you can draw in 30 seconds. 
Then on five separate pieces of paper, draw five more spaceships (each in 30 seconds). 
Then ask 10 people which spaceship they like best. Do you think they will like the first 
spaceship you drew? The odds are that your first drawing (that is, your first idea) is 
rarely your best, and people have varying ideas of which is the best-drawn spaceship; 
hence, feedback is important.
Design Thinking
Design thinking is an approach where teams have the space to consider the 
best options for solving a problem. It empowers those with the most knowl-
edge to work through a solution. It also involves applying iterative and vali-
dated customer learning. It combines some of the incremental and divergent 
thinking in its approach.
Illustrated in Figure 10-6, design thinking starts by understanding the prob-
lem or opportunity by empathizing with the customer. To initially align with 
customers, observe them dealing with the problem or talk to those who 
may benefit from the opportunity. Then, based on what you learned, define  
(or redefine) what you think is the problem or opportunity. (See Figure 10-6.)

Design thinking applies divergent approaches to come up with options on 
how to solve the problem. This may include research and bringing people 
together to brainstorm ideas. From the top ideas, collaboratively converge 
by having the team self-organize around an option that the team thinks will 
solve the problem or address the opportunity. Convergent approaches such 
as ­affinity and red-dot voting may be used to select an option.

Chapter 10 | Applying a Discovery Mindset
120
As you approach prototyping the chosen solution, apply a hypothesis to prove 
or disprove the option chosen for a more systematic way of navigating toward 
certainty and customer value. Test the option by using an iterative and incre-
mental framework to validate if the hypothesis (that is, option) moves you 
toward the direction of customer value. The iterative framework may be one 
of the Agile processes that exist today.
Once an experiment is concluded, examine the results. Based on the results, 
either move forward with the original option or adapt toward another option. 
This requires customer involvement to continuously provide feedback to vali-
date that you are moving in the right direction.
Designing thinking is a good way to bring together the employee and cus-
tomer. As employees are collaboratively engaged and empowered to decide 
how to build customer value, customers are brought in via feedback loops to 
validate whether it meets customer needs.
Is It Time to Lead with the Discovery Mindset?
The discovery mindset and the thinking approaches are meant to create the 
behaviors for the Agile mindset to move the culture toward agility. They are 
great to ready-the-mind and set the tone for the behaviors that focus on cus-
tomer value. Leading with mindset activities avoids the trap of believing that 
mechanically applying an Agile process makes you Agile. Instead, it is a great 
way to achieve the Agile behaviors that can help your enterprise shift to an 
Agile culture and lead you toward customer value.

■Agile Pit Stop  Consider infusing incremental, experimental, divergent and convergent, 
feedback, and design thinking into the early part of your Agile transformation.
As you approach your Agile transformation or you realize that you need an 
injection of the Agile mindset, consider educating leadership and teams with a 
discovery mindset and the thinking approaches it embraces. Consider infusing 
incremental thinking, experimental thinking, divergent and convergent think-
ing, feedback thinking, and design thinking into your Agile environment in the 
early part of your transformation.

Visualizing the 
Enterprise Idea 
Pipeline
An enterprise idea pipeline provides transparency of your options and 
allows you to quickly be aware of and respond to high-value work.
—Mario Moreira
Much of Agile implementations focus on the work within a product back-
log. This is a good start and helps a team and product owner focus on 
the development work ahead. When an enterprise is small or focused 
on just a few products, the initial ideas can go directly into the product 
backlog. What happens when the organization is medium to large? How 
do you view the incoming ideas in a timely manner and how do you make 
investment decisions on where to focus? The answer is via enterprise idea 
pipeline.
11

Chapter 11 | Visualizing the Enterprise Idea Pipeline
122
Pipeline of Ideas
The enterprise idea pipeline provides three primary benefits to an enter-
prise. First, it is a channel that provides an end-to-end flow of ideas from the 
moment they are recorded to when they are released and reflected upon. 
Second, it is the enterprise-level portfolio backlog of ideas. Third, it is meant 
to highlight high-value ideas the moment they come in so that the enterprise 
does not miss the idea’s window of opportunity.
The culture needed for the enterprise idea pipeline is one where the enter-
prise immediately considers ideas as they come in because they are based on 
a current problem or opportunity. You don’t wait for the next budget cycle to 
consider the idea. The pipeline is a more adaptable way of managing the port-
folio of work across your enterprise since ideas can be admitted anytime and 
feedback may change its priority or reshape the idea. Also, the pipeline brings 
enterprise-wide visibility and transparency to the work occurring within an 
organization.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  For an enterprise idea pipeline to operate effectively, it must be in a culture 
where ideas are immediately considered without waiting for the next budget cycle.
Before moving on, what is an idea? An idea is something that is deemed as 
valuable but has not yet been created. At the moment it is recorded, it may be 
small or large. Depending on its level of customer value, it may become work 
that is worthy of evolving into a product or service.
As part of the Agile galaxy, the enterprise idea pipeline is a working example 
of the delivery axis focused on delivering customer value, as illustrated in 
Figure 11-1. As the delivery axis represents the end-to-end flow of customer 
value from the recording of the idea to the point where it is released and then 
reflected upon, so is the enterprise idea pipeline.

The Agile Enterprise
123
The enterprise idea pipeline is known by different names such as a portfolio 
backlog, enterprise kanban board, and idea pipeline. What makes all the terms 
similar is that they imply that the big ideas may eventually (or immediately) 
be worked on by teams. The enterprise idea pipeline acts as the parent and 
feeder to all of the product backlogs and helps you connect strategy and ideas 
to user stories (and even tasks) and vice versa.
An enterprise idea pipeline is primarily used in medium to large companies, 
when visibility is needed to make investment decisions across portfolios to 
better understand where the highest-value work lives. It also helps when 
there are dependencies across multiple products, or when ideas do not have 
an obvious resting place in a product backlog. When an enterprise is small 
and made up of a singular product, the product backlog acts as the enterprise 
idea pipeline as it contains the ideas that may be included in the future of that 
product. Even at the backlog level, new ideas need to be valued to ensure 
that the highest-value idea gets worked first. The moment there are multiple 
products, there may be a need for a portfolio-level backlog that becomes the 
pipeline for upcoming work.

Path through the Pipeline
As discussed earlier, an enterprise idea pipeline provides an end-to-end view 
of the flow of ideas from the moment they are recorded to when they are 
released. It offers a path from idea to delivery. I have found that the Idea 
Management model established by Emergn is a good way to pattern the flow 
of work through an enterprise.
Utilizing the first five patterns to form the 5R model, you create a path for 
your work. As illustrated in Figure 11-2, the five Rs consist of five stages: 
Record, Reveal, Refine, Realize, and Release. The 5R model is meant to be 
adaptable. Some companies may decide to use corresponding terms. For 
example, instead of Realize, the term Develop could be used and instead of 
Reveal, the term Prioritize could be used.

Each stage represents a progression of the idea. It is important to note that 
the path isn’t linear. Some ideas may get to the Reveal stage and are too low 
in value to move farther. Some ideas may get an increment cut in the Refine 
stage and then, once in the Realize stage, feedback is received from customers 
in a demo that find it more valuable, which requires updating the value in the 
Record stage.

The Agile Enterprise

YOUR 5R MODEL EXERCISE
Review the stages of the 5R model (Record, Reveal, Refine, Realize, and Release). 
What terms could be used in your enterprise that represent each of the stages in the 
5R model? Draw out your example.
Recording the Idea
The Record stage is a place to begin documenting what is known about the 
new idea. The documentation should be visible and transparent to everyone 
in the enterprise. Who typically submits or records ideas? Effectively anyone 
can record an idea, but more commonly it is a product owner, a portfolio 
leader, a business or marketing leader, or a manager who is in touch with cus-
tomers. Recording the idea should include a description, persona or market 
segment, the value, the risks of doing the idea or not doing the idea, and the 
assumptions being made. Figure 11-3 illustrates a simple example of recording 
an idea.

Figure 11-3.  Simple example of recording an idea

Chapter 11 | Visualizing the Enterprise Idea Pipeline
126
Within an Agile context, limit the amount of time spent on documenting the 
idea’s details since the idea has not yet been committed for work. The docu-
mentation should provide enough information to gain a general understanding 
of the idea, but not so much that it is a waste of time if the idea is not selected 
to work on. For example, avoid writing a bulky business case for the idea since 
this takes a lot of effort this early in the stage of the idea.
There are several ways that an idea can be recorded. It can be in a freestyle 
format with the necessary information. It can be in a hypothesis format, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 10, along with any additional information. Alternatively, it 
can be written using a Lean Canvas format. You can learn more about how to 
capture ideas using a Lean Canvas in Chapter 13.
A key detail for the Record stage is the proposed value of the idea. I recom-
mend using cost of delay (CoD) and CoD divided by duration (CD3) since this  
provides data on how much money you lose weekly or monthly by delaying the 
value delivered. You can learn more about CoD and CD3 in Chapter 12. However, 
other value techniques may be used. Once the idea, including description, 
persona, value, risks, and assumptions, is recorded, the idea is added to the  
enterprise idea pipeline, where it gets revealed.
Revealing the Idea
The Reveal stage focuses on two areas. The first area is where the new idea 
gets revealed in the pool of ideas, according to its value level. The second one 
is where it is determined if the idea has high enough value so that the owners 
and stakeholders of value (for example, product owners) and Agile team(s) 
are notified of the possible work ahead.
The idea gets revealed in the pool of ideas in a rank-ordered manner based on 
the value that was entered for the idea. This new idea rises to its level of value 
in the pool, as illustrated in Figure 11-4. If it is one of the top ideas, it will be 
prominently available for people to view. If it has a lower value, it will sink to 
its level of value and may not be discussed further. From an Agile perspective, 
if it doesn’t rise to a high-enough level of prominence, it’s not worth spending 
more time until it does, if it ever does. The main benefit of this approach is 
that as high-value ideas come in, they immediately get rank-ordered so they 
don’t miss their market opportunity.

The Agile Enterprise
127
Who typically reviews and evaluates the recorded idea? Owners or stake-
holders of value (such as product owners and chief product owners) and 
those that help drive investment decisions (for example, business leaders, 
marketing, and senior management) should be the ones who do this work. 
They should all have a stake in the success of the work and operate with a 
discovery mindset.
If the idea floats toward the top of the pool in your enterprise idea pipeline 
based on its value, several things occur. First, there should be a healthy discus-
sion surrounding the idea. The owner or contributor of the idea should share 
the details, the risk of doing or not doing the work, how the value was calcu-
lated, and the assumptions being made in calculating the value. It is important 
for the owners of value to periodically check the pool of ideas so that high-
value ideas are promptly discussed.
In an effort to continue to validate the value of the idea, stakeholders should 
challenge the assumptions made that determined the value. Toward the 
beginning of the idea journey is when the least amount of information is 
known about the idea. Challenging the assumptions of value is beneficial to 
the health of the enterprise as it will determine where investments in people 
and resources are being made. Challenging assumptions of value also reduces 
gamesmanship of the data’s value.

Let’s consider a hypothetical situation: The owner of the idea assumed that the 
potential market for the idea included a hundred million customers. However, 
current data indicates that it is only twenty million. The importance of chal-
lenging assumptions is to start with fair assumptions, ergo fair value. More 
information on challenging assumptions can be found in Chapter 2 (more 
general) and 12 (specific to value).
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Challenging the assumptions of value is beneficial to the health of the enterprise 
as it will determine where investments in people and resources are being made.
Once discussion is concluded, changes are made to the idea, which may include 
updating details about the idea and adapting the value. The idea floats to the 
level of its adapted value. If it continues to appear that the idea is of high value, 
it is time to consider the team (or teams) that will work on it and the depen-
dencies the team may have on other teams and resources. Once identified, the 
team is notified of the idea coming its way. The purpose is to gauge how much 
work that team already has on its plate. From here, people and prioritization 
decisions can be made.
When making people decisions, if it is clear that this team is the target for a lot 
of high-value work, then it behooves the enterprise to add people to the team 
or adapt another team’s skills to that type of work. When making prioritiza-
tion decisions, if it is clear that this new idea has a higher value than current 
work in the team backlog, then a re-ordering of work should occur.
If a high-value idea requires the help of two or more teams, a chief product 
owner or portfolio leader can gauge how much work each team has on its 
plates and when it can pull the work into its backlog based on its current 
velocity during the Reveal stage. The goal by the end of the Reveal stage is for 
teams to provide a pull signal for the high-value work at the earliest possible 
moment so the idea misses as little of its market window as possible.
In order for a new high-value idea to get pulled in a reasonable timeframe by 
the teams, a discussion on slack time should occur. If teams’ backlogs are so 
full that it is makes it hard for them to pull work in the foreseeable future, 
then you may not be allowing enough slack in the system. The benefit of slack 
is twofold. First, slack helps a team consistently deliver on their commitments 
with quality work since important design and refactoring emerges. Second, 
slack allows time to respond to emergencies, time to explore high value work, 
and time for innovation. Without slack, a lot of high-value ideas could easily 
sit in a wait state for some time.

Refining the Idea
The Refine stage consists of a combination of the team(s)’ beginning to under-
stand the idea, the team(s)’ beginning to decompose the idea into an incre-
ment and user stories, and their continuing to validate the value of the idea. 
When the high-value idea sitting in the reveal pool gets pulled by the team(s), 
it is ready to get refined. The intent is to move away from the big upfront 
mindset where months are spent attempting to document all of the require-
ments. Instead, collaboratively focus on a slice of the idea where feedback is 
use to gain a better understanding of the value of the idea.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The intent of the Refine stage is to move away from big upfront requirements 
and instead focus on a slice of the idea in a collaborative and evolving manner.
Who should be involved in refining and decomposing ideas into smaller pieces? 
Those that have ownership over products (product owners) and those that 
self-organize on how to build those products (teams) should be involved. In 
this case, everyone on the team should be involved including developers, tes-
ters, architects, database, and UX. They should all have a stake in the success 
of the work and be educated and operate with a discovery mindset. Also, you 
want the whole team involved so that when it is time to build the idea incre-
ment in the Realize stage, the full team has first-hand knowledge of the work 
involved in the Refine stage.
While you may have learned that more than one team is involved in the idea 
during the Reveal stage, it is in the Refine stage where you learn the details of 
the dependencies. An idea may cross team and division boundaries. During the 
Refine stage is when the beginning of cross-team coordination should occur.
It can be challenging to take an idea and decompose it into epics and user 
stories. One recommendation is user story mapping. The short-form story 
mapping is both a visual practice that provides you with a view of how a user 
might use an idea (in other words, the product or service) and a decomposition 
practice that helps you consider how you may incrementally decompose the 
idea. Established by Jeff Patton, the visual portion helps the team understand the 
customer experience by imagining what the customer process might look like. 
This encourages the team to think through what the customer finds as valuable.
The decomposition portion of story mapping allows the team to think through 
a number of options of the customer experience, cut a slice of the idea as 
illustrated in Figure 11-5, and get feedback from the customer. The options 
within the slice become epics and user stories that represent the user expe-
rience. This helps both validate the value of the idea and ensures the idea is 
being built in a way to provide the best customer experience.

Chapter 11 | Visualizing the Enterprise Idea Pipeline
130
A benefit of story mapping is that as you work incrementally, one slice at a 
time, you validate the value that has been ascribed to the idea. Instead of build-
ing the whole idea over months, you build a slice and then get actual customer 
feedback as to the value of the idea. The feedback is used to adapt toward 
customer value as well as to update the idea record and the value score.
You should only cut one slice at a time. You may learn that the first slice either 
provided the value or that the customer didn’t find the idea valuable enough 
to move further. You can learn more about the details of story mapping and 
how to implement a story-mapping session in Chapter 16.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Cutting increments of work via story mapping or use cases can help determine 
the value of an idea prior to the whole idea being built.
There are other ways to decompose ideas into increments. Use cases can 
be used to map interactions between actors (which can be personas) and 
a system within a particular environment to achieve a goal. Much like story 
mapping, the goal is to cut a slice or increment of work that represents one 
of those interactions and then show it to customers or users to get feedback 
on the value of the idea and the customer interface.

Another activity that helps decompose and, more importantly, better under-
stand the business and technical detail of the work is the act of grooming (also 
known as Scrum refining). The end goal of the Refine stage is that you have 
a slice of work from the idea that should be in the form of epics and user 
stories that can be placed into your product backlog. Another goal is that you 
are aware of the dependencies and risks that can impact the work ahead and 
begin mitigating them.
Realizing the Idea
The Realize stage is the art and practice of building the idea into a working 
product. Commonly known as product or software development, it is the 
art of developing a product in a methodical manner. All team members who 
engage in building a product are involved in the Realize stage. Those involved 
should include all cross-functional team members such as development, qual-
ity assurance (QA), database, UX, documentation, education, and configura-
tion management—effectively anyone who has the ability to turn the idea into 
a piece of customer value.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The PO prioritizes the work in the backlog, shares business context with the 
team, and incorporates customer feedback to better align with customer value.
In the Realize stage, the product owner has a strong role to prioritize the 
work in the backlog according to customer value, to share business context 
with the team, and to incorporate customer input and feedback as the idea 
evolves to better align with customer value.
In the Reveal stage, you may have learned that there is more than one team 
involved in building the increment of an idea. In the Refine stage, the teams 
should work together to cut the first increment. Now in the Reveal stage, the 
teams should establish communication touch points such as Scrum of Scrums 
to coordinate and collaborate as they build their pieces of the increment.
Within the Agile galaxy, it is in the Realize stage where you typically see Scrum 
and Kanban occurring. Irrespective of what Agile process used, an iterative 
process should be applied so that you can iteratively plan, build, inspect, and 
adapt the deliverable toward customer value.
The primary activity involved in the Realize stage is to develop an idea. From 
the Refine stage, the epics and user stories from the slice or increment make 
their way into the product or team backlog(s), as illustrated in Figure 11-6. 
The team(s) should further groom the epics into user stories and gain more 
detail about the user stories. From there, an iterative approach should be used 
to develop and test the product.

Chapter 11 | Visualizing the Enterprise Idea Pipeline
132
Iterative and incremental Agile engineering practices should be applied in the 
Realize stage. This may include eXtreme Programming (XP) practices such as 
pair programming, continuous integration, test-driven development, collective 
code ownership, refactoring, and more. Also, integration testing should occur 
for those instances where two or more teams are working on an idea. This 
should include system, performance, load, and any other tests that may be 
needed. The goal of Agile is that when the product is completed at the end of 
an iteration, it should be potentially shippable.
Because the Realize stage results in a potentially shippable product (that is, 
something to actually see), customer feedback loops should be used to vali-
date if the idea is valuable to customers. There should be a concerted effort 
to invite customers based on personas to the demonstrations to gain valuable 
feedback to ensure the idea is being developed in the direction of customer 
value. Also, sales and marketing may initiate a launch plan for making current 
and potential customers aware of the new or updated product.

Releasing the Idea
The Release stage is the activity that converts the in-house built idea and 
launches it into the public, as illustrated in Figure 11-7. The goal of Agile is that 
by the end of an iteration, it should include activities to make the idea poten-
tially shippable. Then there may be final integration testing, code preparation, 
packaging, and launch activities in release.

Figure 11-7.  Launching the idea into the market
In some cases, there may be final integration activities, particularly when there 
are two or more teams working on an increment of an idea to ensure both 
pieces execute together. Final integration testing provides an opportunity to 
perform final testing to include system, integration, performance, load, and any 
other tests that may be needed. This should be limited since such testing or a 
significant portion should occur in the Realize stage.
Code preparation and packaging begins with version controlling the code used 
for the release. From there, activities vary by production platform. For a web 
site, identifying executable code and updating the website with the new code 
may be all that is needed. For mobile applications, packaging the new release 
onto an app store for people to download and providing any terms and condi-
tions may be enough. For on-premise products where they are installed onto 
desktops and servers, setting up a downloadable web location for code or 
burning the code onto disks, packaging user guides, and crafting terms and 
conditions are part of the process.

Chapter 11 | Visualizing the Enterprise Idea Pipeline
134
Another aspect of the Release stage may be to execute the launch plan drafted 
by marketing and sales. This activity communicates to the current and poten-
tial customers a bit about the new increment that is now on the market. Once 
a release occurs, you should update the enterprise idea pipeline showing that 
the first increment has been released.
Reflecting on the Idea
The five stages of the 5R model have been explored: Record, Reveal, Refine, 
Realize, and Release. Some collapse the 5R model to 4Rs (Reveal, Refine, 
Realize, and Release). Some expand the 5R to a 6R model. I have found it pru-
dent to include a sixth R called the Reflect stage.
While most product development life cycles end at the Release stage, I believe 
it is important to add a phase where you reflect on the results of the deliver-
able, as shown in Figure 11-8. How well did it do once it was on the market? 
How many customers were willing to pay for the product? Was the deliver-
able satisfactory to customers? Is the product being used as advertised?

There are many types of feedback loops that can be used to gain an under-
standing of the product. This is why reflecting is very important in understand-
ing the real value of the product. The feedback helps you determine how to 
adapt the idea for the future.

The Agile Enterprise
135
Most importantly, the Reflect stage ensures that you revisit the value placed 
on the idea in the Record and Reveal stages. Did you make the money you 
thought per what was written into the value or cost of delay of the idea? It 
is critical to the integrity of the R model that those involved understand that, 
once released, you will reflect on the idea and gauge its real value. While chal-
lenging the assumptions of value for an idea in the Reveal stage reduces gam-
ing the value score, having to reflect on the actual value data once released 
can help further reduce any gamesmanship of the value data at the beginning.
REFLECTION OF VALUE EXERCISE
Consider the last release you were a part of. Attempt to find the value data that was 
used to promote the idea. This may be in the form of return on investment (ROI), cost 
of delay (CoD) or potential revenue data. Then look for the actual revenue made from 
the release. What was the difference? Has anyone actually compared the initial value 
data with the actual?
Are Your Enterprise Ideas Visible?
The enterprise idea pipeline provides you with an end-to-end view of the  
flow of ideas from the moment they are recorded to when they are released. 
As an enterprise-level portfolio backlog of ideas, it is meant for the enterprise 
to respond to high-value ideas the moment they come so the enterprise does 
not miss the idea’s window of opportunity.
It is a more adaptable way of managing the portfolio of work across your 
enterprise and responding to feedback. Specifically, it is meant to highlight 
high-value ideas the moment they come into an enterprise so that they can 
be worked on almost immediately and the enterprise can take full advantage 
of the window of opportunity. Whatever you chose to call the enterprise idea 
pipeline, it holds the big ideas that will eventually (or immediately) be worked 
on by the teams. The enterprise idea pipeline is the parent to all of the prod-
uct backlogs and helps you connect ideas to user stories.
The operation of the enterprise idea pipeline feeds right into your enter-
prise Agile budgeting and investment process. It can help you see where your 
high-value work is. You can learn more about effective Agile and continuous 
budgeting in Chapter 19.

Prioritizing with 
Cost of Delay
Throwing a bunch of products against a wall to see what sticks is a recipe 
for disaster.
—Chapter co-author David Grabel
At the height of Microsoft’s market domination and valuation, Bill Gates 
and Rich Balmer were interviewed by a major news magazine. They said 
that Microsoft had too much to do and not enough resources. If it was true 
for Microsoft, it is probably true for every single company in the world. 
Organizations have too many good ideas. Trying to do all of them clogs the 
system and little gets done. In order to deliver the most customer value in the 
shortest possible time, you must prioritize. There are many ways to prioritize. 
Which one is best for you?
What happens when a company does not prioritize? When teams have a 
history of being late, some leaders respond by asking for everything on the 
wish list. They assume that if they ask for everything, they will at least get 
something. Paradoxically, the reverse is true.

Chapter 12 | Prioritizing with Cost of Delay
138
Focusing on Customer Value
When an organization works on too many ideas at once, the overhead and 
context switching slow teams down. The more things you start, the fewer 
things you finish. Even when you limit the work in progress (WIP) to the 
capacity of the development teams, you often overload related organiza-
tions—manufacturing, sales and marketing, training, or customer support. In 
her book, Manage Your Project Portfolio, Johanna Rothman1 states that it is the 
responsibility of portfolio managers to reduce WIP.
When organizations ignore customer value, the portfolio of work can get filled 
with low-value items. Capacity limits force companies to ignore better oppor-
tunities. To maximize business outcomes, you need an objective way of select-
ing the programs that will deliver the highest customer value. In Chapter 11,  
the Record stage was referenced in the enterprise idea pipeline. In Record, a 
value is used to rank order ideas to help the enterprise focus on the highest-
value work. Prioritization methods help you come up with an optimal rank 
order. The best ones will provide an objective value or score.
Highlighting Prioritization Methods
When working with teams and projects, you may have used some of the sim-
pler, qualitative methods for prioritizing the product backlog. Some teams just 
follow the product owner’s (hopefully well-informed) opinion. Some other 
methods include MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t 
Have), “Buy a Feature,” or HiPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion).
At the sprint level, it is the right and responsibility of the product owner (PO) 
to have unilateral responsibility of priorities in the product backlog. Good 
POs regularly meet with their stakeholders (customers, chief product own-
ers, sales managers, architects, technical managers, and so on) to get input for 
prioritization. Some POs add structure to the process using one or more of 
the following prioritization methods:
• 
MoSCoW: This method helps frame the PO’s thinking 
to define the smallest possible solution that could pos-
sibly work. This approach places a level of importance 
on each requirement including a wish-list container that 
helps bucket features or stories that should be recog-
nized as having been considered and explicitly deferred 
or rejected. This approach succinctly explains the deci-
sions that have been made and allows the team to focus 
on the “must haves.”

The Agile Enterprise

• 
Buy a Feature: This is an online “game” developed by 
Innovation Games (now Conteneo) to help POs choose 
the features to include in an upcoming release that 
would be most valuable to their customers or stakehold-
ers. Each feature being considered is listed along with 
a “price.” The price might be related to the estimated 
development cost or anticipated customer value. The 
players (customers) are each given a fixed amount of 
play money to spend on features. Expensive features may 
require customers to negotiate and pool their money. 
This is encouraged. Playing this game multiple times with 
different sets of customers can give the PO useful data on 
what is more likely to satisfy customers.
• 
HiPPO: Senior leaders typically have many years of expe-
rience in the industry. Even when they want their teams 
to own decisions, they feel that it’s their duty to share 
their knowledge and offer opinions, particularly on pri-
orities. If they are expressing an opinion, treat it as one of 
many inputs from the stakeholders. If they believe their 
opinion is the correct one, you might have to accept 
their opinion as the decision. This is known as HiPPO. If 
you sense a trace of epistemic arrogance, as discussed in 
Chapter 2, attempt to discourage this certainty thinking 
as this removes the opportunity of options and allows 
the enterprise to apply a discovery mindset toward cus-
tomer value.
These are all qualitative prioritization methods. They are based on opinions 
and individual preferences. While qualitative methods are sufficient for prod-
uct backlog and sprint-level planning, enterprise-level prioritization deserves 
economic justification. At this level, the stakes are too high to leave prioriti-
zation to subjective methods. When you have many good ideas, you need an 
economic rationale to help sort the high-value ideas from the lower-value 
ones that clutter your portfolio and distract people and investments.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Qualitative methods are sufficient for product backlog and sprint level planning. 
Enterprise-level prioritization deserves and requires economic justification.
Many organizations make portfolio-level decisions based on HiPPO. There 
are rare instances where companies have completely disrupted industries and 
dominated their markets by implementing the vision of a single leader. There 
are vey few visionaries like Steve Jobs who can provide that kind of vision. 
Even Steve Jobs could be wrong. Remember the Newton?

Chapter 12 | Prioritizing with Cost of Delay
140
Some of the common economically based prioritization methods include 
Return on Investment (ROI) and Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF). ROI is 
(Value/Effort)*Confidence, where value is typically measured in incremental 
revenue. WSJF is a ranking based on a subjective, linear, and relative business 
value. It factors in a relative-time criticality and risk reduction. Since all three 
of these factors are estimated on a linear scale of 1–10, any one of these fac-
tors can be over weighted and distort this subjective view of cost of delay. 
While these have been used in traditional organizations, they overlook some 
important elements that Agile enterprises need to consider.
Exploring Cost of Delay (CoD)
Since the goal of most companies is to make profits, it is important to under-
stand the economic consequences of prioritization trade-offs. The best way 
to measure the value generated by an idea is the life-cycle profit impact, which 
is the incremental gross margin generated by that product over its useful life 
cycle. CoD measures the life-cycle profit impact over time and, therefore, is an 
excellent way to clarify both the value and urgency for new ideas in the pipe-
line. It is an economic-based method that allows companies to prioritize those 
ideas that will create the highest value by putting a price tag on time. As Don 
Reinertsen has said, “If you only quantify one thing, quantify the cost of delay.”
CoD is the net change in forecasted gross margin per week. CoD is typically 
stated per week to support the granularity of the impact of priority trade-offs. 
If you have an annual forecast, divide by 52.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Cost of Delay (CoD) is an economic method that allows companies to prioritize 
those ideas that will create the highest customer value by putting a price tag on time.
By focusing on life-cycle profits, CoD makes it clear that prioritization deci-
sions can be based on more than incremental revenue. Revenue is important, 
but it is only one of the four major ways in which an idea can impact profits. 
The contributors to life-cycle profitability are as follows:
	1.	 Increase revenue - Grow sales to new or existing cus-
tomers with ideas that delight customers and increase 
market share. Disruptors increase market size and make 
the pie bigger.
	2.	 Protect revenue - When competitors or market condi-
tions threaten the revenue stream. Ideas or innovations 
that improve current products can sustain current mar-
ket share and revenue.

The Agile Enterprise
141
	3.	 Reduce costs - Look for ways to increase efficiency that 
will reduce costs that are currently being incurred. This 
will improve the gross margin or profit contribution.
	4.	 Avoid costs - Make improvements to keep the current 
costs constant. This eliminates costs that are not cur-
rently being incurred, but may be in the future. An exam-
ple is conforming to new regulations to avoid fines.
Calculating Cost of Delay
A simple way to calculate the CoD is to determine the profit via all four con-
tributors to profitability in a given year. It can also be done for a three-year 
period, and then divided by three. This CoD example will use a weekly figure 
to drive home the impact of priority trade-offs, so you divide the annual gain 
by 52. Here is the working calculation with examples:
CoD = (Contributors to Profitability including Increase Revenue + Protect 
Revenue + Decrease Costs + Avoid Costs)/52
• 
Example #1: Increasing conversion rate. You have an 
idea in the pipeline that would improve the customer 
experience on your website, projected to increase the 
conversion rate from 5.5% to 6.0% (or a 0.5% increase). 
If you have approximately ten million visits to your site 
per year, your average sales order is $32, and your aver-
age gross margin is 30%. The increased contribution to 
profitability from the additional revenue in one year is 
(10,000,000*$32*0.005*.30) or $480,000. The weekly 
CoD is $480,000/52 or $9,230. This is an example of 
CoD to increase revenue.
• 
Example #2: New regulations. The Consumer Protection 
Agency has issued a new regulation requiring increases in 
information security to counter the latest threats from 
hackers. The company ignored this regulation when it 
was issued. Now the security measures must be in place 
or the company will face fines of $100,000 per calendar 
day. Since we know the cost per day, the weekly CoD is 
$700,000. This is an example of CoD to avoid costs.

Chapter 12 | Prioritizing with Cost of Delay
142
• 
Example #3: New mobile application. Customers have 
been asking for a mobile app to access financial prod-
ucts. Having this application available could retain about 
240,000 current customers and add another 360,000 
new customers in the next year. It is estimated that the 
company can make $36,000,000 in a year. The weekly 
CoD is $36,000,000/52 or $692,308. This is an example 
of CoD to protect revenue and increase revenue.
As a word of caution, do not use the CoD as a forecast. It is only a prioriti-
zation tool. When the CoD is used as a forecast, it becomes the target on 
the back of the product owner. This can drive fear into the organization and 
impact the value of the CoD.
As we will see later, assumptions can greatly impact the CoD. By challenging 
assumptions and applying a uniform set of standards about assumptions, the 
CoD of different opportunities can be compared. Therefore, protect the value 
of assumptions driving these important conversations and prioritization.
COD EXERCISE
Pick two ideas from your current enterprise idea pipeline (or list of ideas). Working 
with your team, look at the relevant factors for life-cycle profitability and calculate the 
CoD. Make all of the details of your work visible. Does the CoD that you calculated 
change the ranking for either of these ideas?
Enterprise Value Curve
By using the CoD, you can understand where you can have a significant impact 
on profitability. Consider the value curve distribution of the value of ideas 
that companies typically work on. As shown in Figure 12-1, all too often, com-
panies fund or initiate few of the really high-value ideas (whose CoD can be 
enormous) because they are so consumed by the low-value work.

The Agile Enterprise
143
Why do companies fund so many ideas with little or no value and do not fund 
ideas that are high value? It would seem logical that they would want to invest 
in primarily the ideas with the highest CoD. The problem is that companies 
tend to use subjective prioritization methods and trust their gut. They do not 
use economically based methods like CoD to make investment decisions.
When you use the CoD to select ideas from your pipeline, your value curve 
is more likely to resemble the one in Figure 12-2 than the typical value curve 
shown in Figure 12-1. You will be investing in the high-value ideas instead of 
the long tail of low-value ideas. Cutting the tail will increase profitability by 
allowing your company to focus on the highest-value work.

Not all CoD profiles are equal. Some products have a very long lifetime and, 
once you hit the peak profitability, the ongoing profits are stable, as illus-
trated in Figure 12-3. In this case, the CoD is linear and constant. This analysis 
looks at the urgency profile associated with the product in its market. Other 
urgency profiles include short life cycle, peak affected by delay; long life cycle, 
peak affected by delay; and short life cycle, seasonal or date-driven.

The “late entry” line highlights the cost of delaying customer value, which 
means delaying the opportunity to increase profitability. The longer the late 
entry line, the more you miss. If you wait too long, a competitor can be first to 
market. This changes your urgency profile to “peak affected by delay, long life 
cycle” and can leave you with a smaller piece of the overall pie.

Calculating CD3 for a Value Score
In order to make optimal investment decisions, you have to include one more 
factor—duration. Some organizations would rather fund three medium-value 
projects that can be delivered quickly rather than one high-value project that 
could take years. To complete the analysis, you get an estimate of the duration 
for the project.
The estimate of duration should be consistently applied to ideas. You may 
use “dream” or “standard” duration. Dream duration is the shortest possible 
duration if you have all of the people and resources able to work on the idea, 
while standard duration is the typical duration when including all dependen-
cies and wait states. I recommend dream duration, but either is fine when 
getting started.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  CD3 value scores provide a rough rank order and highlight when ideas are 
orders of magnitude in value from other ideas. When CD3 value scores are in the same order, 
further investigation of the assumptions and alignment to strategy should be factored.
You can calculate a value score called CD3 (CoD divided by duration). CD3 
asks for the CoD amount and then you divide by your duration method 
(dream or standard) = (for example, Cost of Delay/Duration).
• 
In Example #1 above, the CoD per week is $9,230. If the 
dream duration is three weeks, the CD3 value score is 
($9,230/3) or 3,077 or 3K.
• 
In Example #2, the CoD per week is $700,000. If the 
dream duration is 24 weeks, the CD3 value score is 
($700,000/24) or 29,167 or 29K.
• 
In Example #3, the CoD per week is $692,308. If the 
dream duration is six weeks, the CD3 value score is 
($692,308/6) or 115,384 or 115K.
In these examples, you will notice that Example #3 is an order of magnitude 
larger than Example #2, and Example #2 has a CD3 score that is an order of 
magnitude larger then the CD3 in Example #1.
The intent of CD3 is to provide a rough rank order. With CD3 scores of 3K, 
29K, and 115K, respectively, it is clear that Example #3 should be considered 
as the idea with the highest value. However, if you have a CD3 score of 3K and 
4K, then further investigation of the assumptions and alignment to strategy 
should be factored into the decision on which one to work on next.

Chapter 12 | Prioritizing with Cost of Delay
146
By calculating a CD3 score for every idea in your pipeline, you can rank 
order them during the Reveal stage to maximize your return, as illustrated in 
Figure 12-4. This can help you predict which idea will yield the biggest posi-
tive impact on profitability for the time invested. Since there is much to learn 
about CoD and CD3, consider reading The Principles of Product Development 
Flow by Donald Reinertsen2 and the Black Swan Farming’s website.3

Challenging Assumptions about CoD
CoD is calculated early in the idea life-cycle. As a result, in order to calculate 
the CoD, many assumptions have to be made. As part of transforming toward 
an Agile culture, it is important to apply a discovery mindset that includes 
positively challenging assumptions so that you can better understand the idea 
and you can better ensure that the idea is of the value it states or adapts 
accordingly for the betterment of the enterprise.
For Example #1, which is focused on increasing conversion rate, by challeng-
ing the assumptions, you learn some readily available facts such as the number 
of small businesses in North America. As you challenge the 0.5% increase 
from 5.5% to 6.0%, you learn that this conversion rate is based on a history 
of similar products. Some data has a high degree of confidence based on the 
data warehouse and some are a guess. It is important to know which is which.

■
■Agile Pit Stop  When moving to an Agile culture, positively challenge CoD assumptions in 
order to better understand the idea and provide a more objective rank order for the enterprise.
The PO might argue that the conversion rate would actually increase to 
7% while the experience designers might defend the original 6% estimate. 
You could design a quick prototype to validate with customers to see which 
increase is more realistic. While different assumptions can result in widely 
varying initial calculations for the CoD and CD3, this process allows you to 
make those assumptions more visible.
When you do challenge assumptions, make sure you use open-ended ques-
tions. For example, use questions such as the following: What led you to that 
conclusion? What do you think the level of uncertainty is? What is your riski-
est assumption? What information do you need to validate this?
When people have widely different calculations, you can challenge the 
assumptions behind those calculations beginning in the Reveal stage. By having 
reasoned conversations about those assumptions and ironing out those differ-
ences, you can get a consensus on the likely CoD and value score by applying 
CD3. When the value scores or rankings are based on subjective, gut feelings, 
those discussions can turn negative.
CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS EXERCISE
Have two separate teams calculate the CoD for the same idea in your pipeline. Each 
team should clearly document all of their assumptions. Was the CoD the same, 
close, or far apart? If there is a wide discrepancy, examine the assumptions and see 
if you can identify the differences of opinion. If so, have a conversation about why 
different teams made different assumptions and see if you can close that gap. These 
discussions can be very revealing and lead to a quick consensus on the prioritization.
Are You Cutting the Tail?
Prioritization can take many forms, from gut feelings to qualitative research to 
quantitative research. Since selecting the right enterprise ideas to invest in will 
have a major impact on the company’s profitability, it makes sense to evaluate 
these ideas using an economic approach. CoD and CD3 are good economic 
methods for prioritizing ideas in the enterprise idea pipeline.

Chapter 12 | Prioritizing with Cost of Delay
148
By working on the highest value ideas, it exposes the tail of low-value work 
that is left. The question is, will you cut the tail? It may be more challenging 
than you think because people will come up with many reasons why that work 
is important. If you apply a value-based model for identifying low-value work, 
you can begin making better investment decisions.
If you are not already doing so, try using CoD and CD3 for prioritizing your 
current list of on-deck ideas. Plot them in a value curve showing the highest 
CoD as your first idea and the lowest as your last. This plot is likely to look 
similar to Figure 12-1. Are you ignoring high-value ideas? Are you investing 
too much in the long tail of low-value ideas? How can you cut the tail?

Capturing 
Ideas with Lean 
Canvas
Paint a robust yet lean picture of an idea on a canvas to help those 
seeking to understand the idea and the value of the idea.
—Mario Moreira
When an idea flows into a company, there needs to be ways to express the 
idea in a meaningful yet concise way without bulk and extensive time com-
mitment. Within an Agile context, limiting the amount of time spent on doc-
umenting the idea upfront is recommend since the idea has not yet been 
committed for work. In other words, why invest a lot of time into something 
that may not be worked on?
When you include too much information about the idea, it can be overwhelm-
ing and appear too certain. On the other hand, including too little information 
can make the idea feel ambiguous. The challenge is the uncertainty is what 
you have the most of upfront. Therefore, spending a lot of time attempting to 
prove an idea is valuable right upfront is a fool’s errand. Instead, you should 
look for leaner ways to document the idea in a meaningful way, knowing that 
discovery and learning are needed to prove its value to the customer.

Chapter 13 | Capturing Ideas with Lean Canvas

Canvas Approach to Documenting Ideas
The traditional way to document an idea is write a business plan. There are 
some elements that can be gleaned from the business plan including the sum-
mary or pitch of the idea, financial highlights, and assumptions. Business plans 
are particularly useful when looking for money to finance an idea. Unfortunately, 
business plans have a reputation of being laborious because their intent is to 
prove upfront that the idea has value.
What are the alternatives? There are a number of vision and canvas approaches 
that are more appropriate for an Agile galaxy where you acknowledge you 
know less upfront, so the record of the idea should be equally trim. Within 
this chapter, I will share the Business Model Canvas, the Lean Canvas, and the 
Customer Value Canvas, designed specifically to support your focus on identi-
fying and capturing customer value.
Before I introduce the canvases, it is important to know the context of where 
to apply a canvas. Following the enterprise idea pipeline, the Record stage is 
where to document the new idea in the canvas, as illustrated in Figure 13-1. In 
Chapter 11, I wrote that an idea can be written freestyle, as a hypothesis, or 
alternatively using a canvas. The key is to keep it meaningful, yet lean.

Once the canvas is drafted, it should be visible and transparent to everyone 
in the enterprise. Just as each idea should include a description, persona or 
market segment, the value, the risks of doing the idea or not doing the idea, 
and assumptions being made, so should the canvas.
Business Model Canvas
In order to provide context to the Lean Canvas, you need to recognize the 
Business Model Canvas. The Business Model Canvas was one of the initial 
leaner ways of representing information that was typically found in a business 
plan. The Business Model Canvas was originated by Alexander Osterwalder 
based on his earlier work in business model ontology.
This canvas uses the premise that a simple business model can describe how 
an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. This canvas approach was 
created to provide a one-page, straightforward way to map business elements 
to a proposed business idea or strategic plan to help guide the direction of 
an enterprise.
Here is a quick walkthrough of the Business Model Canvas using the illustra-
tion provided in Figure 13-2. The value propositions are the ideas of what you 
are offering the customers. The customer segment consists of the customers 
or users you want to serve. The customer channels are ways to reach custom-
ers. The customer relationships are the ways you want to build relationships 
with customers within each segment.

Chapter 13 | Capturing Ideas with Lean Canvas

The revenue stream is a calculation of revenue of how much money you can 
make based on what the customer will pay. Key resources are those people and 
equipment needed to turn the idea into reality. Key activities are those activi-
ties that turn the idea into reality. Key partners are those people outside your 
team or enterprise that you rely on. Cost structure includes the expected costs 
of building the proposition.
Within a Business Model Canvas context, you can start anywhere. I recom-
mend you start with the proposition and work from there. However, if you 
are targeting a specific customer segment, then this could be a good place to 
start. In any case, the point of having all of the business blocks in front of you 
is that you can organically consider any or all of the areas in the same work 
period without specifically focusing on a particular area.
Lean Canvas
The Lean Canvas came about as an experiment by Ash Maurya. He felt the 
Business Model Canvas was effective for an existing business that focused on 
existing key partners, customer relationships, and business direction. However, 
Maurya was looking for something that helped better capture hypothesis 
thinking associated with a new problem or solution in a startup environ-
ment. He investigated Rob Fitzpatrick’s four steps to epiphany and adapted the 
Business Model Canvas to form the Lean Canvas.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The Lean Canvas is a more actionable and entrepreneurial business plan 
adapted to focus on immediate problems and opportunities.
The Lean Canvas is a more actionable and entrepreneurial-focused lean busi-
ness plan. It was adapted to focus on more immediate problems and oppor-
tunities and look for their solutions. The culture behind the enterprise idea 
pipeline is meant to support the immediate evaluation of current problems or 
opportunities. The Lean Canvas provides meaningful, yet concise information 
suited for an Agile culture.
The Lean Canvas is a one-page, straightforward way to map business elements 
to a problem. It gets established during the Record stage. It is particularly use-
ful in the context of the enterprise idea pipeline as ideas are meant to evolve. 
The Lean Canvas is meant to evolve and pivot as new information is learned.

Here is a walkthrough of the blocks in the Lean Canvas, illustrated in Figure 13-3  
as guidance. The Problem block is where you identify what you are trying to 
solve. Include the top three problems related to an area. This block also asks you 
to consider existing alternatives in case an existing solution is currently avail-
able in-house or on the market. The Customer Segments block shows the target 
customers or users and asks you to consider early adopters. The Solution block 
defines how to address the problem for the customer segment being targeted.

fits into the larger picture. Some call this your elevator pitch. The Unfair 
Advantage block consists of the plusses you have over your competitors. 
The Revenue Stream block shows the potential revenue generated. The Cost 
Structure block reveals the expected costs associated with the solution. The 
Key Metrics block includes the metrics that will show progress toward the 
outcomes being looked for. The Channels block focuses on ways to reach the 
customer segments.

Applying the Lean Canvas
This section provides you with an example of working with the Lean Canvas. 
The PO and those who have an investment stake (sales, marketing, and so on) 
in solving the problem may be collaboratively involved in building the Lean 
Canvas. Once built, the canvas should be shared during the Reveal stage to 
determine if the idea is high priority enough to move forward with.
Work on the Lean Canvas typically starts by identifying the problems you have 
in an area. You may start with the Customer Segment block if there is a prob-
lem with a specific customer and you want to first learn about the customer 
segment. For this example, it will start with the problem.
Figure 13-4 shows an example of how you and the stakeholders may work 
through a problem using the Lean Canvas. The group collaborative discusses 
the problems, identifying three top challenges recorded in the Problem block. 
This includes customers not being able to access their money when they are 
out, losing customers, and having customers get upset when they have to go 
home or to the bank to access their money. They consider existing alterna-
tives such as using the computer or sharing another bank’s mobile network.

From there, the team explores the Customer Segments block and realizes that 
the problems impact many of the existing customers and are a barrier to 
getting new customers. The team identifies the Gen Y customers as early 
adopters since they tend to be willing to adopt new solutions, particularly 
mobile-related solutions, more quickly. They consider their Unfair Advantage 
block and recall that they have a large customer base with historically high 
customer satisfaction.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  When considering your customer segment, it is important to identify early 
adopters as they are often more willing to use early versions and provide feedback.
The team decides to consider their Unique Value Proposition block and rec-
ognizes that security protocols have made banking secure and the pervasive 
access using ATMs and computers has made it special for their customers. 
The team collaboratively crafts a simple elevator pitch of how they want the 
bank to be perceived: “Bank from wherever you are knowing your transaction 
is safe and secure.”
The team decides that the solution should be to build a mobile application 
for their customers. They work on key metrics to help them better grasp if 
progress is being made once the mobile application is released. The team col-
laboratively considers the Channels block to determine where they can make 
their customers aware of the new mobile application.
They conclude by walking through the high-level Cost Structure block, which 
includes servers, integration tools, development time, and marketing. Finally, 
they consider the Revenue Streams block, where revenue can be made with 
new customers or avoided by reducing customer attrition.
LEAN CANVAS EXERCISE
Think of an idea that is either waiting to be considered or has already come to fruition. 
Find at least one other person to work with you. Start with a Lean Canvas template 
and apply each block to the idea in the order of the example above: Problem, Customer 
Segment, Unfair Advantage, Unique Value Proposition, Solution, Key Metrics, Channels, 
Cost Structure, and Revenue Streams. Explain the idea to two other people. What was 
the feedback and what did you learn?

Chapter 13 | Capturing Ideas with Lean Canvas
156
Customer Value Canvas
Just as the Business Model Canvas is an adaptation toward leaner business 
plans, the Lean Canvas is an adaptation of the Business Model Canvas to solve 
more immediate problems. The Customer Value Canvas is a change of the 
Lean Canvas with a singular focus of being customer-value-driven (CVD) and 
incorporating elements of value (CoD, feedback loops, personas, and so on).
The Customer Value Canvas is an actionable way to document and evaluate 
an idea based on the first step in learning customer value. It was adapted to 
focus on ideas to determine their value and align with a discovery mindset 
(sometimes referred to as the Discovery Canvas). It is, for this reason, why 
this canvas is a good approach for the enterprise idea pipeline. The Agile cul-
ture behind the enterprise idea pipeline is meant to support the immediate 
evaluation of meaningful and concise ideas as they come in.
The Customer Value Canvas is a one-page, straightforward way to map busi-
ness elements to a proposed idea specifically focused on getting to customer 
value. It gets established during the Record stage. It is particularly useful within 
the context of the enterprise idea pipeline as ideas are meant to evolve. The 
Customer Value Canvas is meant to pivot as new information is learned (for 
example, challenged assumptions, feedback from experiments, iterations, 
increments, and demonstrations).
Here is a walkthrough of the blocks in the Customer Value Canvas illustrated 
in Figure 13-5. The Opportunity block is where you state the problem you are 
trying to solve or the new idea you want to explore. This block also asks 
you to consider existing alternatives in case an existing or partial solution is 
currently available in-house or on the market. The Customer Personas block 
contains the customer or user groups you are targeting.

The Agile Enterprise
157
The Idea as Hypothesis block asks you to create a hypothesis that affirms you 
are approaching your idea in a more scientific and data driven manner. The 
Assumptions and Risks block asks you to include assumptions and risks you 
identified as they relate to the idea when calculating CoD and duration. The 
Feedback Loops block includes the ways you plan to capture feedback to vali-
date you are moving in the direction of customer value.
The Unfair Advantage block tells you what advantages you have over your 
competitors. The Channels block shows ways to reach the customer perso-
nas. The Cost of Delay and Value Score block includes the type of cost of delay 
(CoD), the CoD per week, and the CoD divided by duration (CD3) as the 
value score. The Cost and Duration block shows the expected costs associated 
with the solution, including an estimate for dream duration. The Key Metrics 
block contains the metrics that show progress toward the desired outcomes 
and the results once released.
Applying the Customer Value Canvas
This section provides you with an example of working with the Customer 
Value Canvas. The PO and those who have an investment stake (that is, the 
product owner constellation) in evolving the idea should collaboratively build 
the Customer Value Canvas in the Record stage. Once built, it should be 
shared during the Reveal stage to determine if it is high priority enough to 
move forward.

■Agile Pit Stop  The Customer Value Canvas uses opportunities instead of problems since the 
idea can be to solve a problem or explore an innovative idea.
Figure 13-6 shows an example of how you and a group of stakeholders may 
work through an idea using the Customer Value Canvas. The group collabora-
tive discusses an innovative idea or problem. This discussion includes captur-
ing new customers who are mobile-centric and those that can’t access their 
money when they are out. These details get documented in the Opportunity 
block. The group members consider existing alternatives and learns they may 
be able to re-use some code from another group that has built a mobile 
application.

David the Gen Y-er persona as an example of early adopters since they tend to

They consider their Unfair Advantage block and realize that they have a large

159
In the Idea as Hypothesis block, the team crafts the idea using a hypothesis 
format. They consider their costs and duration of the work in the Cost and 
Duration block, which includes servers, integration tools, marketing, and a 
dream duration for development time. Then the Cost of Delay and Value Score 
block is visited where the cost of delay is established and the value score is 
calculated using CD3. Because there is very limited data and information at 
this point in the idea life cycle, they document the assumptions being made 
and known risks in the Assumptions and Risks block.
The Feedback Loops block is added to include customer input and feedback 
during the Refine stage and throughout the Realize stage. The team works on 
key metrics to understand if progress is being made while building the mobile 
application and once it is released. The team collaboratively thinks through 
the Channels block, determining where they can make their customers aware 
of the new mobile application.
CUSTOMER VALUE CANVAS EXERCISE
Think of an idea that is either waiting to be considered or has already been realized. 
Find at least one other person to work with you. Start with a Customer Value Canvas 
template and apply each section to the idea in the order of the example above: 
Opportunity, Customer Personas, Idea as Hypothesis, Assumptions and Risks, 
Feedback Loops, Unfair Advantage, Channels, Key Metrics, Cost and Duration, and 
Cost of Delay and Value Score. Explain the idea to two other people. What was the 
feedback and what did you learn?
The Living and Pivoting Canvas
When using any of the canvases discussed in this chapter, you should consider 
them all living. They should live as long as the idea is deemed valuable and 
should be archived when it is clear that it will not float high enough in the 
Reveal pool to merit attention.
The idea on the canvas is the manifestation of an actual working product 
or service as it flows through the enterprise idea pipeline. The canvas is the 
record for the idea and, therefore, should evolve as the idea evolves. A canvas 
is meant to be updated as new information changes the idea.
For the Lean Canvas and Customer Value Canvas, the canvas should be 
updated as you work through each part of the 5R or 6R model, assuming the 
idea continues to be valuable. It should be a snapshot in time for where the 
idea is to date. However, it is not meant to be a status report of the idea but

Are You Painting Your Canvas of Ideas?
Just as the Business Model Canvas is an adaptation toward leaner business 
plans, the Lean Canvas is an adaptation of the Business Model Canvas to solve 
more immediate problems. The Customer Value Canvas changes the Lean 
Canvas for a singular focus of being customer-value-driven and working with 
the elements of value (CoD, feedback loops, personas, and so on). I strongly 
recommend that you experiment with the Lean Canvas and Customer Value 
Canvas to gain personal experience with each one.
What colors are you using to paint your canvas? If you are either using a heavy 
document like a business plan or providing very little information to make a 
qualified and quantified decision on what to work on next, consider adapting 
to a canvas approach. Try it once. Adapt it to fit your needs if you find it helps.

Incorporating 
Customer 
Feedback
It’s not about achieving Agile for Agile’s sake. It’s about delivering customer 
value and achieving better business outcomes.
—Mario Moreira
The most important ingredient in understanding customer value is precious 
customer feedback. A customer-value-driven (CVD) enterprise is a company 
that optimizes for what the customer finds as valuable and adapts until this 
outcome is met. As you look to build a CVD engine within your enterprise, 
the customers and, specifically, their feedback are the “driver” that steers the 
engine of customer value.
Gaining customer feedback along the delivery axis is crucial, from the Record 
stage to the Reveal stage to the Refine stage to the Realize stage to the 
Release stage and, finally, to the Reflect stage. Feedback should be collected 
more than once, and it should always be incorporated. It must be collected, 
considered, sorted, merged, and applied toward customer value on a continu-
ous basis.

Chapter 14 | Incorporating Customer Feedback

As a reminder, who is a customer? A customer is someone who has a choice 
of what to buy and a choice of where to buy it. A customer is someone exter-
nal to the company and pays money to help you stay in business by purchasing 
your product. Consequently, engaging the customer is of utmost importance. 
When talking about customer feedback in this chapter, we are referring to 
people who are outside of the company who have the choice of buying your 
product and, hence, providing revenue to the company.
Throughout this chapter, I will discuss incorporating feedback loops along 
your delivery axis, constructing personas, embedding personas, and creating 
a customer feedback vision. By doing these things, you can more systemati-
cally understand your customers and engage them during many meaningful 
moments to receive their precious feedback.
Customer Feedback Loops
Feedback loops are specific points along the idea pipeline where the output 
received from one activity is used as input in the next activity. In the case of 
building an idea, feedback from a customer who has attended a demo is used 
as input in the next planning session to adapt the direction for the product 
or idea.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  There are two types of feedback loops. Verification ensures you are building the 
product right, and validation ensures you are building the right product.
Feedback is the result of an activity and can be termed as testing an idea. 
There are two primary types of testing: verification and validation. Verification 
testing provides you feedback to help determine whether you are building the 
product right and that it works as designed. If the button is supposed to take 
you to a new location, verification testing will check it and provide feedback 
on whether it does or not. The testers in most verification testing are employ-
ees internal to the company.
Validation testing provides you feedback to determine if you are building the 
right product and are satisfying the needs of customer. If the user story says 
to build a button, then validation testing would ask the customers if they are 
satisfied with the button, providing the enterprise with customer feedback to 
understand if the product is adequate or if a change is needed. In this case, the 
testers in validation testing are meant to be customers who are external to 
the company. Customer feedback loops are, therefore, a type of validation test 
to ensure you are meeting the needs of customers.

The Agile Enterprise
163
Customers delight in seeing working product in action and the inspect-and-
adapt approach allows customers to consider and adjust their needs until 
they are transformed into a valuable working product. Feedback loops should 
be considered all along the delivery axis of the idea pipeline, as illustrated in 
Figure 14-1. The outcome of each customer feedback loop informs future 
decisions and product direction. As a note of caution, a non-disclosure agree-
ment (NDA) may be needed with external customers prior to sharing ideas 
as part of any feedback loop.
Mindset behind Customer Feedback Loops
The concept of learning what the customer considers valuable is an important 
mindset in the journey to customer value. This learning allows you to shed the 
dangerous attitude of pretend or arrogant certainty and allows you to explore 
what the customer needs. The best approach is to incorporate the concept of 
learning through feedback to identify what is customer value. This is a discov-
ery method of gaining incremental information through customer feedback 
loops and taking what you learn to continuously adapt toward customer value.

The goal is to have as many customer feedback loops as feasible. This can be 
challenging and, in some Agile efforts, the result is few if any customer feed-
back loops. Customer feedback can be an uncomfortable endeavor in that it 
can frustrate those who’ve invested time into a building a product. It requires 
a mature and willing mindset to collect, consider, sort, merge, and apply the 
feedback to get closer to customer value.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Establishing customer feedback loops consists of part mindset and part 
practice. You need to believe in the importance of customer feedback to achieve customer value.
To prevent frustration and pride of ownership when a lot of time has been 
invested in working on a product, apply short iterations or periodic time-
frames where demonstrations occur more regularly. This limits the investment 
of time before it gets reviewed and ensures you don’t move too far in the 
wrong direction before customer feedback is gained.
As simple as it sounds, embrace the fact that customer feedback is a very 
positive outcome, ensuring the betterment of the product and company suc-
cess. If you are used to a process where you sub-optimize for following a plan 
over responding to customer change, then responding to change by accepting 
customer feedback can be a tough mental shift. The answer is to develop a 
discovery mindset that is always willing to collect customer feedback.
Also, spend time identifying the best feedback loops for the effort and con-
struct a sound vision for customer feedback. As you consider the best cus-
tomer feedback loops for your effort, look for places along the delivery axis 
where getting feedback is of high importance and low effort. A good example 
is the Web-based sprint review or demo. Customers can observe the demo in 
a low-effort manner from the privacy of their office or home.
Types of Customer Feedback Loops
There are many types of customer feedback loops that can be applied as the 
idea travels through the enterprise idea pipeline. The most common customer 
feedback loop is the sprint review or demo where customers view the work-
ing product developed to date. As illustrated in Figure 14-2, there is a list of 
customer feedback loops with details that you should consider applying to 
build a stronger path toward customer value.

The Agile Enterprise
165
During the Reveal stage, share the idea on a Lean Canvas or Customer Value 
Canvas with customers. Then walk through the idea with customers to see if 
the idea’s manifestation is what they had in mind or if it is something that they 
would find valuable. The goal is to understand if you are moving in the direc-
tion of customer value.
During the Refine stage, play the “Buy a Feature” game referenced in Chapter 12 
to help POs choose the features to include in an upcoming release that would 
be most valuable. In this game, the players (customers) use play money to buy 
and negotiate for features they find most valuable. The goal is to understand 
what customer value looks like to customers.
During the Refine stage, bring in customers to review the user story map 
prior to cutting an increment. Highlight the backbone and process in order 
to validate the customers’ experience path. Then walk through the options to 
gauge their level of interest and to see if some options are more compelling 
than others. The goal is to move in the direction of customer value.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Customer feedback loops can be applied along the delivery axis from five 
stages: Reveal to Refine to Realize to Release and, finally, to Reflect to help you move toward 
customer value.
Figure 14-2. Various customer feedback loops through the delivery axis

Chapter 14 | Incorporating Customer Feedback
166
During the Realize stage, invite customers to the sprint review or demo. This 
is a type of feedback where the team or PO demonstrates the working prod-
uct completed during the sprint to customers in order to highlight progress 
and gain the all-important customer feedback. The goal is to have demos peri-
odically so adaptions to customer value can occur regularly. The goal is to 
move in the direction of customer value.
During the Realize stage, invite customers to participate in a hands-on 
customer-experience activity. This is a type of activity where customers 
experiment with the product in a hands-on manner in a simulation or pilot 
environment. Such activities may be a form of a customer or user experience 
exercise and may be known as alpha or beta. The goal is to gain usability and 
satisfaction feedback.
During the Release stage, for those on-premise products that require instal-
lation, ask customers for product-installation feedback. This is a type of val-
idation where customers physically install the working software into their 
environment. This can apply to customers installing a product onto servers or 
mobile customers downloading an app. In both cases, receiving technical and 
satisfaction feedback is beneficial.
During the Reflect stage, the idea has made its way to the public. This is 
a time to collect an array of feedback: how well it is doing in the mar-
ket, how many customers have paid for the product, if the deliverable is 
satisfactory to customers, if the product is being used as advertised, and 
more. Primarily, the goal is to capture revenue data, market share data, 
and customer satisfaction data to ascertain if it is perceived as valuable to 
customers.
As you look at possible feedback loops, the question is not about having a 
lot. The question is about having feedback loops at points where they can 
help you understand customer value. Some feedback loops may return less 
feedback value than the effort it takes to establish them. Look for the “high 
feedback value, low effort to establish” feedback loops first.
FEEDBACK LOOPS EXERCISE
Consider the product that you are working on today. What customer feedback loops 
do you currently employ? What additional feedback loops along the delivery axis can 
you add to allow you to adapt toward customer value?

The Agile Enterprise
167
Building Customer Personas
When you are building a product, how well do you know your customers? 
Can you visualize who they are? Do you understand their motivations? Do 
you have user stories for all of the customer types that may use your product? 
By knowing who your personas are for the product that represents your idea, 
you can answer yes to these questions.
Personas represent specific users for your product or service and act as exam-
ples for the types of users who would interact with it. Most products have 
several personas that use the product in different ways. Examples of three 
personas for a banking product are Erin the Senior Citizen, Sunny the Gen 
X-er, and David the Gen Y-er.
• 
Erin the Senior Citizen represents customers who use very 
basic user interface functionality to conduct straightfor-
ward tasks. They primarily use a computer or work with 
tellers to conduct their business. They are primarily moti-
vated to check balances and extend their investments.
• 
Sunny the Gen X-er represents customers who need more 
complex interface functionality to handle sophisticated 
tasks. They are technically savvy on the computer and less 
so on the mobile phone. They are primarily motivated 
to do more banking on the phone to take advantages of 
opportunities.
• 
David the Gen Y-er represents customers who can work 
on both simple and complex interface functionality. They 
are technically savvy on the mobile phone. They are rela-
tively new to investment and are motivated to under-
stand investment practices and for ways to invest their 
money.
All three customer personas use the product differently, and diverse features 
are designed for their respective needs. Personas are a powerful way to guide 
your decisions about functionality and ensure that you are, in fact, building 
functionality to help each persona. Personas are a key ingredient in the way 
user stories can be presented. Including the persona in a user story descrip-
tion provides you the point of view (POV) and defines who the user story is for. 
Typical information in a persona includes the following:
• 
Fictional name with function
• 
Demographics: age, gender, education, and family status
• 
Background, responsibilities, and experience in story form
• 
Motivations that drive their ideas and behavior

Chapter 14 | Incorporating Customer Feedback
168
• 
Pain points that show the areas of frustrations that impact 
them
• 
The goals or job to be done
• 
A quote that sums up what matters most to the persona
• 
Casual picture representing that user group
I recommend that you establish a persona for each persona type. This descrip-
tion typically portrays a fictitious person who represents a real role. Writing 
a persona as a fictitious person with a name makes the persona easier to 
imagine and relate to as illustrated in Figure 14-3.
Typically, the product owner constructs a persona. Personas should be initially 
considered as early as the Record stage, should be drafted in the Refine stage, 
and should be shared with the team so team members better understand 
whom they are building the idea for. Afterward, the personas should be posted 
in the Agile team or work room where refining, grooming, planning, and other 
Agile team events occur. They should also be shared with those stakeholders 
involved with prioritizing the work in the Reveal stage.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Jobs to be done shift your focus from the product and to the job that product 
can do for the customer. It isn't a calendar. Its job is to remind you of appointments.

The Agile Enterprise
169
Consider establishing personas for your products so that you can understand 
the customer point of view when evolving the idea from the Reveal stage to 
the Reflect stage and build a product that better aligns with customer needs.
PERSONA EXERCISE
Consider one of your products or ideas. Identify at least two different persona types 
that may use that product. Using a format similar to Figure 14-3, draft those two 
personas including a fictional name, demographics, background, motivations, pain 
points, jobs to be done, a quote, and a casual picture. Share the personas with at least 
two other people, explain them, and get feedback for improvement.
Personas of Today and Tomorrow
Customer value comes in two parts. The first is understanding the customer 
of today via personas. This is having the pulse of the customer and the mar-
ketplace as you continually receive and adapt to customer feedback. It takes 
a creative, yet disciplined, focus on what you think the customer needs and 
where you think the customer marketplace is going.
The second is understanding the customer of tomorrow. This can be crafted 
in the persona called Customer 2.0, which is the customer of tomorrow, and 
looks to find out what you think they want and what they don’t yet know they 
want (unknown unknown) to help with future product direction.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Customer 2.0 is the customer of tomorrow that you are aiming for.
An example of an unknown unknown is the large smartphone. Who would 
have guessed that, as the market was moving to smaller and smaller flip 
phones, customers would move to larger phones? An example of a known 
is customers wanting their apps better integrated. During the Refine stage, 
you may establish a part of your idea or backlog of work to integration work. 
Customer 2.0 can be aligned with the future perspective of a product vision 
and help you adapt personnel and tools toward that vision.
Customer 2.0 is a unique type of persona known as the “future customer.” 
While it may be hard to identify people that fit into this persona, you can look 
for people who are trendsetters searching for the cutting-edge technology or 
products. While Customer 2.0 is focused on the future, your primary focus 
should be on the needs of the customer of today with a secondary focus 
on the needs of the customer of tomorrow. Immediate customer feedback 
should drive a majority of your decisions.

Chapter 14 | Incorporating Customer Feedback
170
Using Personas from Record to Reflect
Personas can have a significant benefit along the delivery axis to ensure what 
is being delivered is of value to the customer. The main benefit is that any-
one associated with the idea will better understand the customers and users, 
which helps guide better decisions about the functionality. In order to effec-
tively apply the intent of the persona, you must embed the concept of perso-
nas all along your delivery axis, as illustrated in Figure 14-4.
As early as the Record stage, personas should be considered to gain an under-
standing of whom the idea is meant for. If you use any of the canvases discussed 
in Chapter 13, there is a specific block for personas (that is, customer segment).
In the Reveal stage, personas could be used to help drive prioritization deci-
sions. Particularly for existing products, there may be a specific persona that 
needs significant attention, which helps drive prioritization. For example, if the 
mobile interface is currently complex and geared to David the Gen Y-er (as 
early adopter) but you need to adapt it to Sunny the Gen X-er, knowing the 
Gen X-er persona can help with Sunny’s experience.
In the Refine stage, a specific persona may be used as the reason to cut a first 
increment of the idea. When you consider the user or customer experience, 
is there a specific persona that you are targeting? For example, David the Gen 
Y-er may have a different customer experience or pathway through the mobile 
interface than Sunny the Gen X-er.

In the Realize stage, personas should be part of the user story construct. This 
ensures that a persona is written into the user story. It also helps teams under-
stand who the requirement is being written for. For example, Erin the Senior 
Citizen may require a simpler mobile interface than Sunny the Gen X-er.
In the Realize stage, testers can create acceptance tests and test cases that 
support the way specific personas might use the product. For example, the 
test case of how David the Gen Y-er may might use the mobile interface is dif-
ferent from the test case of how Sunny the Gen X-er might use the interface.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Ensure you gain feedback from the right persona because feedback from the 
wrong persona can lead you down the wrong path.
In the Realize stage, based on personas, the product owner knows whom to 
invite to the reviews or demos to gain the best feedback. This is particularly 
important as the feedback from one persona can give you bad feedback if the 
feature is meant for another persona. For example, feedback from David the 
Gen Y-er will give very negative feedback about functionality meant for Erin 
the Senior Citizen. In fact, for every feedback loop of any kind, you need to 
consider the right persona group(s) to invite.
In the Reflect stage, when you collect revenue data, market share data, and 
customer satisfaction data, it can be beneficial to attempt to understand what 
personas the data are coming from. If, for example, you learn that 90% of your 
revenue is coming from Sunny the Gen X-er, then during future prioritization 
decisions in the Reveal stage, this information can be factored into what gets 
built.
Customer Feedback Vision
The composite of thinking through and establishing a serious feedback 
approach for ideas, along with feedback loops and personas, is something I 
term as the Customer Feedback Vision. Unfortunately, serious thinking and 
applying feedback loops are missing from many product teams professing to 
be Agile. Most customer feedback in Agile is limited to the demo and often 
customers are not in attendance. Customer feedback is the guide for cus-
tomer value and should be taken far more seriously.
The goal of the vision is having a place to capture the thinking behind applying 
customer feedback. This simple vision includes building personas, establishing 
feedback sessions, identifying the companies, and finding ways to motivate the 
customers to attend the feedback sessions, as illustrated in Figure 14-5.

Chapter 14 | Incorporating Customer Feedback
172
This vision should be owned by the Product Owner and live with the product. 
Once established, the vision should be shared with the team so that every-
one is aware of the vision and the importance of the validation activities. The 
Customer Value Canvas can be used as a starter home since feedback loops 
and persona blocks are included. If you currently don’t have a place for formu-
lating and establishing a feedback vision, then the Customer Feedback Vision 
should be used.
Are Feedback Loops Leading to Customer 
Value?
As you look to build a customer-value-driven (CVD) engine within your enter-
prise, the customer or, more specifically, customer feedback, is the “driver” 
that steers the engine of customer value. A CVD enterprise optimizes for 
what the customer finds as valuable and adapts until it meets this outcome. 
This means gaining customer feedback all along the delivery axis is crucial. 
Feedback must be collected, considered, sorted, merged, and applied to guide 
you to what the customer finds as value.
In pursuit of customer value, implementing effective feedback loops form 
the backbone for a CVD engine. Establishing personas help you and all 
those involved to gain a strong understanding of whom you are building for. 
Embedding personas along the delivery axis ensures that the right customer(s)

is being focused on. Remember, you can get feedback from the wrong per-
sona, which can lead you away from customer value. Knowing what persona(s)

help you consider feedback elements leading to more meaningful customer 
feedback.

Establishing Your 
Requirements 
Tree
To know if the highest-value ideas are being worked on, you need to 
recognize the parent/child relationships from idea to user stories.
—Mario Moreira
Requirement is a nebulous term. It can mean something large like a corporate 
strategy or something tiny like a task. People often throw around the word 
requirement without a strong sense of the type of requirement it refers to 
or the level it belongs to. Are people talking about a user story, a business 
requirement, a technical requirement, a strategy, an idea, or a task?
The fact is that companies have all levels of requirements. However, the levels 
of requirements are not always clear to employees or management. I’m not 
suggesting that the levels have to be the same across an enterprise, but they 
should be known at a product team level. This lack of clarity should not be left 
up to chance, and I suggest that you take the effort to understand what your 
requirements tree might look like.
15

Chapter 15 | Establishing Your Requirements Tree
176
Requirements Tree
I often recommend that a company or product team understand their require-
ments lineage, which I term a requirements tree. It is a structure that repre-
sents the relative hierarchy among various requirements elements within your 
enterprise. The idea that has been discussed in previous chapters is a key 
requirements element that is at the larger end of the requirements element 
spectrum. User stories are found at the smaller end of the requirements ele-
ment spectrum. Since requirements drive the work within an enterprise, it 
is good to know if you are working on the highest-value requirements or 
random requirements that made their way in through the secret and often 
unevaluated backdoor. Can you trace the lineage of user stories and tasks to 
the high value idea they represent?
What are the various requirements elements? There is no industry standard 
group of requirements elements, and they can vary from enterprise to enter-
prise. The point is to understand what yours might look like. I like to start with 
corporate strategy and end with tasks, as illustrated in Figure 15-1.
Once you establish the levels of your requirements tree, it is important to 
craft a definition to describe each level. Using the requirements levels from 
Figure 15-1, here is how I describe each level. A corporate strategy includes 
high-level goals and direction set for the enterprise. A division strategy focuses 
Figure 15-1.  Example of a requirements tree

The Agile Enterprise
177
on goals and direction for a division. An idea is a value-driven and outcome-
based opportunity. An increment is an end-to-end slice of the idea to validate 
the value of an idea. An epic is a function, feature, or large user story. A user 
story is a requirement that fits into a sprint or can be completed in days, is 
non-compound, and is for one persona. A task is a very small unit of work 
that has a tangible result of incrementally building the user story.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  A requirements tree allows you to understand the level of requirements being 
discussed, traceability among requirements, and education needed for the team on levels.
You may notice that instead of putting the corporate strategy on top, I place 
it on the bottom. I do this to represent the corporate strategy as the trunk of 
the tree because it should provide guidance for how the smaller requirements 
elements (such as ideas, increments, epics, user stories, and tasks) should grow. 
While your strategy may adapt over time based on customer feedback and 
where your market place is headed, it should guide the type of work you may 
consider in the short run.
This version of the requirements tree as illustrated in 15-1:
Corporate strategy to division strategy to ideas to increments to epics to 
user stories to tasks
Other versions of a requirements tree may be as follows:
Business vision to business objectives to business requirements to technical 
requirements to tasks
Corporate objectives to features to use cases to user requirements to tasks
The key to your requirements tree is for you to establish one that makes 
sense for the type of work you do. For example, if you only have one division 
in your company, a division strategy isn’t necessary. Those that may consider 
creating a requirements tree are a combination of executives, product owners, 
and team members. Once crafted, the tree should be shared with everyone.
REQUIREMENTS TREE STRUCTURE EXERCISE
Consider your organization. Can you define the relative hierarchy of requirements 
from the largest requirements element down to the smallest? Consider working with 
another person or two. Attempt to illustrate it. Is there any difference of opinion or 
confusion as to how it may be structured?

Chapter 15 | Establishing Your Requirements Tree
178
Attributes of Requirements Elements
Having a requirements tree benefits you in several ways. First, the tree helps 
you understand the relationships of the various requirements elements from 
the largest requirement (corporate strategy) to the smallest requirement 
(task). Second, the tree helps management and employees understand what 
level of requirement is being discussed. Third, it helps you understand if you 
are missing a requirements level. While it can be reasonable to miss a level, you 
should be aware of it to determine if a discussion is necessary.
As you think about the ideas that flow through your organization and how to 
decompose them into user stories and tasks, it is important to know what 
your requirements tree might look like and the attributes the requirements 
elements should have. This may include the following:
• 
All requirements elements should be customer-value 
focused.
• 
Other than corporate strategy, all other requirements 
elements should have a parent (the epic is the parent 
of the user story) unless unneeded (some user stories 
won’t have tasks).
• 
For every parent, there are typically two or more children 
requirements elements (an idea is made up of six epics).

Not all children need to be completed in order for the 
parent requirements element to satisfy the customer 
need (five of the eight user stories of the epic may satisfy 
the customer).
Within an enterprise, different divisions, groups, and teams can have different 
requirements trees. The exception is that the more dependencies and col-
laboration among teams, groups, and divisions, the more mutually beneficial it 
is to have a shared and common requirements tree.
Navigating the Requirements Tree
There are at least three key benefits to having a requirements tree. First, it can 
help you understand the level of the requirement being discussed. This may be 
more important than initially realized. If someone is talking about a require-
ment at the user-story level vs. the idea level, the discussion can derail very 
quickly. At the idea level, it may be more of a divergent conversation where 
people are considering options, while, at the user story level, it may be more 
of a convergent discussion where people are attempting to pin down details 
because it will be worked on very soon.

■Agile Pit Stop  Understanding the traceability helps you know if work is coming from an idea 
or getting inserted through the backdoor from another source.
Second, a requirements tree can help you understand if tasks, user stories, 
and epics are traceable to an idea. Understanding the traceability of work 
can help you know if the work that is considered of customer value is indeed 
being worked on. It can also help you ascertain if some user stories are getting 
inserted through the backdoor from another source, instead of coming from 
the idea. This can explain why key user stories are not getting completed. It is 
reasonable to have requirements come from other places, but there should be 
accountable awareness that it is occurring.
Third, having a requirements tree can help you educate the team, management, 
and particularly new staff on the levels of requirement types, who participates 
at each level, and what Agile concepts and practices may be used at each level. 
Figure 15-2 illustrates an example of the requirements tree in action and how 
you might decompose from the corporate strategy level up to the task level.

Chapter 15 | Establishing Your Requirements Tree

In this example, I start with the corporate strategy, which may be to satisfy 
banking customers with innovated products. From there, a division strategy will 
consider the corporate strategy and apply it to provide banking customers with 
mobile applications. Then an idea may be to build a mobile app that will increase 
sales by 30% for mobile users in the next three months.
An increment of the idea may be a thin slice to build a secure login to a cus-
tomer’s account and query bank balance. From there, epics may be to create 
login, validate customer credentials, and query bank balance. Using the query bank 
balance epic, a user story may be as follows: As David the Gen X-er, I want to 
view my savings account balance, so I know how much money I currently have. Tasks 
could be to create mobile display frame, create link to savings database, and add 
saving account balance.
REQUIREMENTS TREE NAVIGATION EXERCISE
Working with another person or two, think about your requirements tree. For each 
requirements element level, document what the requirement might look like (as 
illustrated in Figure 15-2). Attempt to use real examples. Share your tree with a few 
people. Ask if they find it helpful and how it could be improved.
Aligning Roles to Tree
A benefit of having a requirements tree is that you can consider who might 
participate at each requirements level, as illustrated in Figure 15-3. While it is 
reasonable for everyone in an enterprise to have input into a requirement at 
any level, there is typically a bounded authority as to who has the responsibil-
ity at each level. Of course, all requirements should be driven by the focus of 
delivering customer value and not arrogant certainty, so expect changes to 
requirement to occur as customer feedback is received.

The Agile Enterprise
181
For example, who has the bounded authority over the strategy, who has the 
authority over an increment of an idea, and who has the authority over the 
user stories? For a corporate strategy, senior management may make the 
decision to consider top strategies. For considering increments of an idea, the 
product owner may make the decision but include input from the team and 
customers. At the user-story level, the team makes the decision on how to 
craft and self-organize around them.
How might your roles align with your requirements tree? Keep in mind that 
anyone can contribute an idea, but only the senior management or product 
owners can make the priority call.

Aligning Agile to Tree
Another benefit of having a requirements tree is that you can consider what 
Agile concepts and practices may be suited at each requirements level, as illus-
trated in Figure 15-4. While it is reasonable to experiment with many of the 
Agile concepts and practices that may work at various requirements levels, it 
can be beneficial to have a starter set and then adapt as you learn what works 
well or what the feasible options are. For example, it may be reasonable to 
start with use cases to help you cut increments and then advance to story 
mapping once there is experience with it.
Following Figure 15-4, executives may use a vision statement to share goals 
with the company at an all-hands. The divisions use a Business Model Canvas 
to discuss where they’ve been, where they plan to go, and how they plan 
to support the vision. Ideas come through the enterprise idea pipeline via a 
Customer Value Canvas that include a cost of delay (CoD) and value score.

To understand if the idea has value, the idea is decomposed using story map-
ping and an end-to-end, thin slice of the idea carved out. Epics and user stories 
that come from the increment are added to the backlog and groomed. Use 
cases are used to flesh out the epics. User stories are written in canonical 
form and have a corresponding unit test. Tasks are then written following an 
incremental development mindset to incrementally build the user story.
As part of the Agile concepts and practices, feedback loops discussed in 
Chapter 14 should be considered for each requirements level to validate the 
direction toward customer value. Find the Agile concepts and practices to 
help you decompose the work from strategy to task that work best for you.
REQUIREMENTS TREE PRACTICES EXERCISE
Working with another person or two, think about your requirements tree. For each 
requirements element level, what Agile concepts and practices can best help you 
collaborate and grasp the requirements elements at that level? Create a diagram 
similar to Figure 15-4. Share it with a few people. Ask if they find it helpful and how 
it could be improved.
What Does Your Requirements Tree Look 
Like?
The term requirement can be quite nebulous as it can mean requirements at 
many different levels. Do you mean corporate strategy, user story, feature, 
idea, or something else? I suggest that you do not assume everyone under-
stands the requirements levels in your enterprise or product team. Instead, 
establish a common requirements tree so people have a baseline of common 
terms. This doesn’t mean the terms and levels are locked in, but instead they 
will be something you mature and adapt over time. A requirements tree pro-
vides lineage from user stories and tasks to ensure that high value ideas are 
being worked on.
I have found that it can be beneficial to create a requirements tree diagram that 
includes all three aspects (requirements elements example, roles, and Agile 
concepts and practices). This can be an effective one-pager similar to a canvas 
to provide both transparency and guidance on how requirements are related 
and how people work together in the enterprise to create customer value.

Decomposing 
Ideas with Story 
Mapping
Story mapping points you at options that help validate customer value.
—Chapter co-author JP Beaudry
When you have determined that an idea is the highest-priority item to work 
on next, it is time to consider how you may validate its value to the cus-
tomer. In the spirit of the Agile mindset, instead of attempting to build the 
full idea (that is, big batch), you should look at a way to build a portion of the 
idea to gain customer feedback. This is where decomposition comes into 
play and where user story mapping can help.
In this chapter, you will learn why big ideas should be decomposed and exe-
cuted via smaller increments. Using the short form known as “story mapping,” 
you will see why it is an excellent tool for that purpose. You will understand 
the basics of doing story mapping, and you will see how story mapping and the 
artifacts it generates can fit in and interrelate with other tools in your Agile 
galaxy and along your journey to build and deliver customer value.

Chapter 16 | Decomposing Ideas with Story Mapping

Why Decompose Ideas
Decomposing big, bold business ideas means slicing smaller increments that 
have customer value. It is a critical activity performed by Lean and Agile 
organizations. It is the core of what happens in the Refine stage of the enter-
prise idea pipeline, as illustrated in Figure 16-1.
There are many reasons why you would consider bringing your big business 
ideas to market incrementally. At a high level, the arguments fall in one of 
two buckets: market reasons and technical reasons.
On the market front, the pace of change in customer tastes and in the avail-
ability of competitive products to satisfy those tastes has never been so fast, 
and it is accelerating. Can you believe that the ubiquitous iPhone is, as of this 
writing, not yet a teenager? In a world where change is the norm, the past is 
no longer a reliable predictor of the future. Logical deduction alone cannot 
identify which products or solutions your customers will adopt. But applying 
experimental thinking can help you discover them.
From a technical perspective, enterprises that participate in the creative econ-
omy never build the same thing twice. Indeed, when something has to be done 
more than once, it gets automated. Therefore, enterprises are usually solving 
problems that are new to them. Your own enterprise may be like that. This

begs several questions. Do you have the technical capabilities to build the 
product? Can you do it at the speed that meets customer expectations and at 
a cost the enterprise can afford and customers can accept?
■
■Agile Pit Stop  There are two reasons why you want to bring your idea to market 
incrementally—to better understand market needs and to reduce technical challenges.
Uncertainty surrounding an enterprise’s ability to deliver can be just as great 
as that surrounding market demand. This uncertainty demands a discovery 
mindset. Experimentation is core to discovery. Because success is not guar-
anteed, you must have the ability to run multiple experiments. These experi-
ments should be short and inexpensive, yet yield as much information as 
possible. Experimental thinking is critical to the enterprise. The Refine stage 
of the enterprise idea pipeline is dedicated to cleverly decomposing big, bold 
business ideas into smaller increments.
Exploring Story Mapping
In the words of Jeff Patton, the person credited for formalizing the practice, 
“Story maps solve one of the big problems with using user stories in Agile 
development—that’s losing sight of the big picture.” He also calls this prob-
lem the “tragedy of the flat backlog.”
A story map is a visual representation of the user journey your enterprise 
seeks to bring to life. It’s a summary and reminder of the story you tell one 
another about what you are building, who you are building it for, what value 
the users will get, the options you have in satisfying user needs, and so on. 
Story mapping supports and promotes the conversation. It does not replace it.
A good way to see how story mapping works is to go through a simple 
example. You’ll first see the steps from beginning to end. Later on, you’ll get 
some practical tips on how to execute those steps.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Cutting increments of work via story mapping can help determine the value of 
an idea prior to the whole idea being built.
As an example, let’s imagine a bank that has a very basic mobile banking app. 
Customers can view balances and transfer money between accounts. Now, 
the bank wants to add bill payment capabilities to the app. How could the 
bank limit its investment, particularly in software development, to discover 

Chapter 16 | Decomposing Ideas with Story Mapping
188
whether its customers are interested in such a capability? The story map will 
make the options clearer. While this example is about augmenting an existing 
customer experience (the mobile banking experience), the same concepts 
apply to greenfield initiatives.
Visualize the User Experience Backbone
The first step in story mapping is to describe the flow of the user experi-
ence at the highest level. Remember that story mapping primarily focuses on 
articulating the user experience and not so much on how to bring the user 
experience to life. In other words, story mapping helps define and organize 
requirements, and then passes the baton to the team to turn those require-
ments into products or services.
In the case of the mobile banker, the users in question are the bank's custom-
ers. The story map will describe their desired experience. You can think of 
the basic flow of the user experience as viewing account balances, transfer-
ring funds, and paying bills, as illustrated in Figure 16-2. Those big activities 
represent what is known as the “backbone” of the story map. Each backbone 
big activity goes on the top of the map.

Determine the Steps
For each backbone big activity, identify the steps that the user undertakes. 
For example, “View Balance” is a step where a user “Selects an Account” and 
“Selects a View Type” (screen, statement, and so on). “Transfer Funds” is a step 
where a user “Selects Source and Destination” and “Determines an Amount.”
What about “Pay Bill”? One can imagine steps such as “Identify Payee,” 
“Define the Payment,” and “Execute the Payment.”
Identifying the Options
So far, the description of the user experience has been very high level and 
applies to all users. The next tier of the story map becomes much more detailed. 
For each step, identify different user-facing options that embody it. For the sake 
of brevity, the remainder of the example will focus solely on the “Pay Bill” back-
bone element, but the procedure is the same for the entirety of the story map.
What are the different alternatives the bank could offer its customers to 
“Identify Payee”? One option is for the bank to maintain a list of well-known 
merchants, credit card companies, and utilities, assuming that doing so would 
save time for many of its customers. At the other end of the sophistication 
scale, another option is to provide an empty text field where customers 
enter name and address of their payee. A variant of that would be to provide 
a form where fields such as street name, city, and zip code are validated. 
Another option still is to enable customers to scan paper invoices for payee 
details. There are likely many other options. Those options are entered 
under their activity on the story map.
This step is a divergent period with no judgment of the options. You should 
not yet be concerned with the value, the cost, the feasibility, the complete-
ness, the competitive positioning, or the strategic alignment of the options. 
That will come later with convergence. For now, you are trying to generate 
good options. Consider a quiet divergent period so that all options can be 
considered and no one dominates the conversation.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  High-level walk-through of story mapping: visualizing your backbone, 
determining the steps, identifying options, prioritizing options, and cutting an increment.
It’s time to flesh out the “Define Payment” activity on the story map. One 
user experience option can be to enter the amount of the payment. Another 
can be to select the source account of the payment. The goal is to identify 
as many options as possible. Another option could be the ability to schedule 
a payment for a later date. Yet another could be the recurrence of payment. 
The options are only limited by your imagination.

Chapter 16 | Decomposing Ideas with Story Mapping
190
To finish off the example, the “Execute Payment” activity could have options 
such as immediate trigger, verification of fund availability, pre-submission 
review of payee and amount details, and so on.
Prioritize the Options
The next step is to prioritize the options in each activity from top to bottom. 
This is a convergent period where you start to look for those options that 
may help you gain customer feedback to validate the value of the idea or that 
can help you determine the technical feasibility.
The criteria for prioritization is context-dependent, but customer value 
should always play a prominent role. Other criteria can be risk, urgency, 
and so on. As you can imagine, there is frequently tension between various 
criteria. You will learn more about prioritization in the “Six Prisms” section 
and how to have a conversation to navigate that tension in the “Practical Tips 
for Story Mapping” section.
Cut the Increment
Now answer this question: Across all activities on the map, which options 
will you deliver to the customer first? Because some options are ambitious 
and because you have some uncertainty about what the customer truly val-
ues, you want to deliver a subset as soon as possible. Delivering all options 
at once is the textbook definition of a big-batch approach.
The mechanics are simple. Draw a line across the story map through the 
options. Everything you place above the line is explicitly targeted for your 
next increment, while everything below is deferred to a subsequent one.
The selection of what goes above the line is where the hard work and magic 
happen. As previously stated, in traditional or waterfall-style development 
where all features are released in one go, everything is above the line. But in 
Agile enterprises, there is a deliberate attempt to bring value to customers 
as soon as possible. There is also recognition of the limits of our knowledge; 
what you think has customer value is not validated until it is in the hands of 
customer. Therefore, the real question is what you move above the line and 
why.
Let’s explore how the bank could make that decision. If the bank is unsure 
that its clientele wants the online payment feature, it is in its interest to bring 
to market the simplest (and cheapest) thing that could possibly indicate cus-
tomer preferences. After all, the bank most assuredly has many other ideas 
that compete for its finite product development capacity.

The Agile Enterprise
191
After some thought and collaborative discussion by the product owner, team, 
and a few key stakeholders, they consider a very simple implementation. This 
includes first selecting a checking account with a view on the screen and then 
selecting a basic text field for the payee, a payment amount automatically 
drafted from the ubiquitous checking account, and a review before execu-
tion. As illustrated in Figure 16-3 on the story map, those options are moved 
above the line, while the others are moved below.
A frequent objection to slicing such a thin increment from a big idea is that the 
increment doesn’t have enough features to satisfy all customers. Remember 
that the objective of this increment isn’t to satisfy all customers. It is rather 
to see if some customers find the concept useful. If the early adopter, David 
the Gen Y-er, doesn’t find online bill payment useful, then it’s possible that no 
amount of bells and whistles will attract the masses. You can learn more about 
minimalistic increments, sometimes known as minimally viable product (MVP), 
by looking up “customer adoption curve” and reading The Lean Startup by Eric 
Ries. This increment could have been crafted differently for many reasons. You 
will shortly learn about those reasons, also known as prisms.

The Living Story Map
Now that the map is created and an increment sliced, what do you do with it? 
First, use the story map to track the execution of the defined increment. In 
many cases, it may take several weeks or sprints to complete an increment. 
During this time, on the story map, you can indicate which options are wait-
ing, work in progress (WIP), or complete, as illustrated in Figure 16-4. These 
options tie directly into your requirements tree. Options will become epics 
and user stories for one or more teams, based on complexity, and are placed 
into the appropriate product or team backlog.
As your teams discover what it takes to turn the increment into a working 
product and as feedback from the market comes in, you update the story 
map accordingly. Because an increment can take several sprints, you may 
learn during a demo that customers don’t like the idea and it may not be 
worth doing the rest of the increment. However, if they like the increment, 
this helps validate the value of the idea. In the meantime, amending the map 
can mean coming up with new activity options, redefining existing ones, and 
making new choices for what is in/out of the increment.
YOUR STORY MAPPING EXERCISE
Now it’s your turn to do story mapping. Imagine you are hired by a bank to help it 
structure its mobile payment app. You learn that over 50% of the bank’s customers are 
senior citizens. How could you carve an increment with the persona Erin the Senior 
Citizen in mind? What options might you provide and what would you work on first?
Figure 16-4.  Highlighting progress on your story map

The Agile Enterprise
193
Six Prisms
To help you consider different ways to carve your thin increment, you can 
leverage the six-prism technique, as described in Deliver Early and Often by 
Emergn. The six prisms include value, geography, risk, stakeholder, urgency,  
and necessity. Each prism gives you a different lens to view your story map. 
The following are details on each prism.
Value asks which piece do customers value most? Instead of waiting to deliver 
everything, focus on delivering the highest-value piece first. The bank exam-
ple utilizes this prism. Tools like cost of delay, as discussed in Chapter 12, can 
help you articulate value.
Geography asks if the product could be launched in just one of the many 
intended markets. E-commerce vendors that sell in many countries find value 
in using the geographic prism. If the bank operated a bilingual app in English 
and Spanish, applying this prism means it would go to market with just one 
of the two languages. The expense associated with translating into the other 
language would thus be deferred until the bank’s conviction that online bill 
payment is indeed good business.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The six-prism technique allows you to consider different ways to carve your 
increment considering value, geography, risk, stakeholder, urgency, and necessity.
Risk asks what the biggest risk to this project or its killer assumption is. 
Applying the risk prism means tackling that first. If the bank were outsourc-
ing its development to a first-time supplier, that relationship would be a risk. 
Keeping the first deliverable small mitigates the risk because the supplier 
skills are assessed at the lowest cost possible. Generally speaking, a proof of 
concept is an embodiment of the risk prism at play.
Stakeholder asks you to think about important stakeholders, whose opinion 
may have a disproportionate impact on your ability to deliver. This may be 
a customer in the form of a persona. It may also be an internal stakeholder, 
such as an executive, who finances your idea. You can learn more about 
personas in Chapter 14.
Urgency gets you to confront important external deadlines. Has a competi-
tor released a form of mobile that would compel your bank to go to market 
with a subset of bill payment as soon as possible? Is there a seasonal reason 
such as Christmas that may urge you to build something earlier? Beware of 
internal deadlines that can promote unhelpful behaviors.

Chapter 16 | Decomposing Ideas with Story Mapping
194
Necessity asks you to consider the bare minimum you can get away with. 
Without this minimum, you are not in business at all. For example, our bank 
could ask clients to send it a text message with their payment instructions 
and could have its tellers process the payments. This is a very basic way to 
achieve the concept of “mobile bill payment.” Also, necessity can have you 
building just enough to avoid the fines of missing a regulation deadline.
Practical Tips for Story Mapping
As you consider approaching story mapping, there are a number of helpful 
tips to get you started. The following are some suggestions meant to maxi-
mize the value you get out of applying story mapping.
Streamline: A story map is a model to help focus thinking. It does not rep-
resent all the nuances of your application. Don’t worry about process flow 
forks; just serialize them.
Persona: A story map is typically written from the customers’ perspective, 
but sometimes your idea will have multiple user types. That’s OK. Just string 
the various flows side-by-side, taking note of the changing persona. You can 
learn more about personas in Chapter 14.
Just-in-Time: You are encouraged to resist pre-slicing many increments. 
You don’t need a second increment defined until the capacity to work on it 
is almost available. Premature slicing is akin to writing a plan. Humans fall in 
love with the plans they create, which makes them blind to feedback that may 
suggest the plan needs to be adjusted (in other words, confirmation bias).
Mob Creation: A way to get buy-in is have all types of stakeholders partici-
pate in the creation of the story map. Broad participation ensures that you get 
specialists from all areas. It also avoids triggering the question “Why wasn’t I 
consulted?” in those who weren’t represented. This is critical because humans 
are more vested in the success of the ideas they create than in the ones they 
are told about.
Diverge, Then Converge: As in many group exercises, you want to hear 
all the voices during the map creation. One tip is to do ten minutes of silent 
diverging when the map is first built. A facilitator should frame the story 
mapping exercise. Then people silently write their ideas for backbone, flow 
steps, and activity options on sticky notes or a digital tool. Then you facilitate 
a period of convergence where you identify affinities and remove duplicates.
Living Document: Shortly after an increment is delivered, you need to 
capture customer feedback. The people who sponsored the work should 
review that feedback and see if it influences how they want to invest their 
development capacity going forward. The story map should be updated to 
reflect the current state of work.

The Agile Enterprise
195
Public Display: Display the story map in an easily accessible public place. It 
provides transparency for the work and helps others know what the team is 
focusing on. It also makes an excellent backdrop for a variety of rituals such 
as planning, grooming, Scrum of Scrums, demos, reviews, and others.
Simplicity: In practice, Jeff Patton recommends building the map “middle-out” 
and let the activities and steps of the backbone emerge. The big activities are really 
just a summary of the steps that appear underneath. Smaller maps may not benefit 
much from this distinction. Only add the complexity if it helps your visualization.
Hypothesis of Value: Last, but perhaps most important, make the hypoth-
esis of the value of the increment clear. When creating a story map, review 
the hypothesis for the idea and any details written on a canvas or idea pipeline 
record. If no hypothesis exists, then establish one. See Chapter 10 for how 
to articulate a hypothesis and Chapter 13 for how to create a canvas. Next, 
ask yourself whether the increment you have sliced is likely to result in the 
desired outcome and whether you are ready and able to measure a signal.
Can Story Mapping Help You Build a Better 
Story?
Decomposing big ideas into smaller increments allows you to better navi-
gate the uncertainty inherent to the work of the creative economy. A useful 
increment seeks to validate customer value. It will do so quickly by being as 
small as possible. Incorporating customer feedback reduces the uncertainty 
surrounding the value of the big idea.
Story mapping helps you validate the hypothesis of customer value as well as 
the assumptions that underpin that hypothesis. You may find that it is useful 
during conversations to call out the primary persona. Understanding who 
the idea is for helps with the customer experience and the types of feedback 
loops that can strengthen the experiment. Getting all the brains to contrib-
ute is one way to manifest more of the collaborative Agile mindset.
Consider exploring story mapping. Which idea is your enterprise thinking 
about trying next to deliver value to your customers? How could you apply 
story mapping to deliver value or test critical hypotheses sooner?

Connecting the 
Idea Pipeline to 
Backlogs
Connecting ideas at the top to user stories at the bottom helps everyone 
see the big and connected picture of the work.
—Mario Moreira
One aspect of helping people to see the full picture is the ability to connect 
the dots from one part of the enterprise to the other. This may not be as easy 
as it sounds since enterprises are rarely one transparent canvas where you 
can see the all the moving parts or the full requirements tree in one space.
What you need are people and mechanisms that can help you connect the 
dots. From a people perspective, you need thinkers, innovators, and leaders. 
These are people who can grasp both the big view of the world and the tiny, 
yet important, details that can make an enterprise move forward.
Connecting the dots in an organization is not easy. Aside from seeing both 
the full picture and the details, everyone involved needs to be able to identify 
dependencies among problems and information and see patterns and trends. 
More deeply, they need to be able to identify the root cause of a problem and 
connect it to a similar root cause in a whole other area.

Connecting the dots, whether through people, process, or technology, can 
help you understand how all the pieces of the work are intertwined, what you 
can do to optimize the flow of the work, and ensure you are actually work-
ing on customer value. Mechanisms such as technology and process can help 
you connect ideas that are valuable to work that will make its way to teams’ 
backlogs.
Connecting to Backlogs
Work comes into the backlog from several sources. The main source should 
be from the idea increments or feedback from customers. In Chapter 16, 
the concept of decomposition and the practice of story mapping are shared. 
When you start a story mapping session, its unclear what the result may be 
until you cut the first increment. You connect the dots by listening to everyone 
in a divergent mode and converging to an increment of work.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Connecting the ideas in the enterprise idea pipeline to their children (that is, 
epics and user stories) in the backlog and vice versa helps ensure a smooth flow of customer-value 
work and traceability from the portfolio level to the team level.
There is a lot of storytelling going on during story mapping, where you consider 
what story the customers are telling as they experience the idea. In making 
storytelling a collaborative session, we effectively ask participants to listen to 
multiple options and connect the dots to a meaningful end-to-end slice.
The challenge in connecting the dots between idea and user story is that you 
start with an idea that can have multiple options and directions. In the middle 
of a story mapping session, it can be quite nebulous as to how it may end, and 
it is important to be comfortable with this uncertainty. The end result is a col-
lection of epics and user stories that are added to a backlog(s).
The key is to connect the ideas in the enterprise idea pipeline to their chil-
dren (that is, epics and user stories) in the backlog and vice versa, as illustrated 
in Figure 17-1. Connecting ideas helps ensure a smooth flow of customer-
value work from the portfolio level to the team level, and it ensures there is 
traceability from the idea down to user stories and tasks.

The Agile Enterprise
199
The penultimate backlog is one that virtually supports all levels of require-
ments elements across your requirements tree. Through the use of filters and 
tags, you can instantiate any level of requirements you’d like to visualize such 
as a portfolio view of all ideas (or at least the highest-value ideas), an idea or 
product view, or a team view. What you really want to highlight is what parts 
of the idea are actually being worked on. It would be great to be able to click 
an active idea and instantly see what user stories are actually being worked on 
that support that idea.
Working with the Backlog
A backlog is effectively a list of prioritized work. Teams in Agile operate from 
a backlog typically called a product backlog, but may be referred to by other 
terms. Backlogs can be stand-alone, although I recommend that they be con-
nected to the enterprise idea pipeline of work on the higher end and even a 
maintenance backlog of work on the lower end.
Product Owners own a backlog. It is their primary tool for collecting and 
managing requirements. It should be the single source of requirements for 
both transparency and efficiency reasons. The PO typically adds work items to 
the backlog and prioritizes them according to the value-based prioritization 
method he or she chooses to use.

The team should have continuous access to the backlog. In the spirit of self-
organizing, anyone may contribute work in the form of epics, user stories, and 
tasks to the backlog. However, only the PO can prioritize the work. The team 
should have edit rights to add details to each work element whether epic, user 
story, or task.
When you look at a backlog, what do you see and how deep do you look? If a 
backlog is prioritized, you see the requirements elements that are deemed the 
most important at the top, as illustrated in Figure 17-2. This work is typically 
the current work the team is focusing on, either in a sprint or recently pulled 
from the backlog. The next set of priority requirements elements are possible 
upcoming work. The reason I say “possible” is that when you apply an Agile 
mindset, requirements are not locked in and they can change. From there, you 
have possible future work followed by may-never-get-done work.
Types of Backlogs
There are many forms of backlogs. They can be in the form of a Kanban board 
or Scrum board. Traditionally, backlogs are aligned with teams and called prod-
uct backlogs or team backlogs. These backlogs are usually filled with epics, 
users stories, and tasks. Agile teams use backlogs to help drive their work. All 
backlogs in Agile are meant to be prioritized. The following are examples of 
several backlogs.
Figure 17-2.  Product backlog iceberg

■
■Agile Pit Stop  Backlogs can be in the form of a Kanban board or Scrum board and may be 
called an enterprise idea pipeline, product backlog, sprint backlog, or team backlog.
An enterprise idea pipeline is form of a backlog. The difference is that the enter-
prise idea pipeline focuses on the portfolio of ideas as they come into the 
enterprise, and it tracks progress from the Record stage to the Reflect stage. 
Stakeholders of value (product owners and chief product owners as well as 
business, marketing, and senior managers) use this backlog to prioritize by 
value and drive investment decisions.
A product backlog is a backlog of work that revolves around a product, service, 
or idea. The PO owns it. While anyone can add work on the product backlog, 
only the PO can prioritize it. Work that comes from decomposing the idea is 
placed in this backlog if it is product-centric. From there, it is often groomed 
to add detail and better understand the work. Those user stories that are at 
the top of the product backlog are of high priority and are ready to be pulled 
and worked on.
The sprint backlog is a backlog of work that fits into a sprint. It represents 
a subset of user stories that are prioritized high enough to get pulled into 
the sprint. Those stories that are highest priority and fit the team velocity or 
amount of work a team can complete within a sprint become the sprint back-
log. There is a unique sprint backlog for each sprint. The items in the sprint 
backlog get pulled from the product backlog during sprint planning. The sprint 
backlog forms the backbone of the work within a sprint.
The team backlog is a backlog of work that is meant for a team. It is beneficial 
when you have multiple Scrum teams building a product together or if the 
team is non-product specific. The team backlog represents a view of the work 
that is geared toward a particular team. During grooming and sprint planning, 
the team hones the work in their prioritized backlog. From that, the team 
can establish a sprint backlog of those high-priority stories they will work on 
within a sprint.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  A story map acts as the third dimension to the two-dimensional backlog and 
provides the customer experience view of the work ahead.
While technically a story map described in Chapter 16 is not a backlog, it 
does provide a view of the current and future work much like a backlog. 
More importantly, a story map provides a third dimension to the backlog by 
providing the customer experience view of the work ahead. It is important 
when story mapping is being used to connect the idea to the story map to the 

Chapter 17 | Connecting the Idea Pipeline to Backlogs
202
backlog. The story map used for an idea should continue to live as additional 
increments are considered and additional options in the form of epics and 
user stories are generated to populate the backlog.
Attributes of Backlogs
The beauty of a backlog, whether an enterprise idea pipeline or a product 
backlog is that you can enhance it with attributes that can help you sort and 
understand the requirements within. Attributes are characteristics that can 
help you find distinctions among requirements. An example of an attribute is 
priority. By including an attribute that helps you consider the importance of 
requirements, you are able to sort the requirements by order of importance, 
allowing you to focus on the high-priority requirements.
Figure 17-3 illustrates a simple version of a backlog. It includes the identifica-
tion number, user story, size, priority, source, an indication of progress, and 
owner of the work. Some people use a paper-based backlog that is laid out on 
a wall, while most people use an online backlog management tool that often 
includes a variety of features.
There are many types of attributes that can be included on your backlog to 
help you manage the work. These attributes include the following:
•

requirements types such as ideas, increments, epics, 
themes, user stories, tasks, and defects.

• 
ID: a way to provide a unique identifier for each 
requirement.
• 
User Story: a requirement that includes who wants it 
(personas), what they want, and why they want it.
• 
Details: information learned during grooming and plan-
ning including decisions.
• 
Acceptance Criteria: the conditions that satisfy a 
requirement typically at the user-story level.
• 
Source: the origin of the requirement, such as customer, 
stakeholder, or strategy.
• 
Priority: a way to differentiate the importance of the 
requirement, often written as high/medium/low or must 
have/should have/could have/won’t have.
• 
Sizing: a way to indicate the amount of work involved in 
a requirement often specified in story points (for exam-
ple, 1/2/3/5/8/13/20).
• 
Complexity: the factors and risks involved in complet-
ing the work written as high/medium/low. Can impact the 
size of the work.
• 
Dependencies: a way to indicate when a requirement 
is dependent on other requirements or external items.
• 
Progress: the current status of the work. May also 
include the history of the item.
• 
Owners: the team members who have volunteered to 
do the work.
BACKLOG ATTRIBUTES EXERCISE
Consider creating a backlog or reflect on your current backlog. What attributes would 
you include to help you organize and sort through your requirements? Create this 
backlog similar to the example in Figure 17-3, but with your attributes. Exercise your 
backlog by adding some actual requirements to the backlog. Explain it to another 
person. Would they change any of the attributes?

Chapter 17 | Connecting the Idea Pipeline to Backlogs
204
Considering Dependencies
Managing dependencies is a big part of running an enterprise. Similarly, manag-
ing requirements is often an activity of managing dependencies. Some work is 
required in order for other work to complete. Other work may be needed to 
complete an end-to-end view of the work.
Be aware of lower-value work that may be dependencies. If a high-customer-
value user story is the next requirement to get pulled for work, you may learn 
upon grooming it that it depends on lower-value work getting done first. In 
this case, either the lower-value work inherits the higher value or you con-
tinue to keep it as lower value and create the dependency link.
Importance of Grooming
Grooming or refining is the process of honing user stories to gain a level of 
detail and get them ready for sprint planning. In relation to customer value, 
while technical details will be discussed, the key focus in grooming should 
be the business details on why an epic or user story is needed. When there 
is a strong understanding of why something is needed and in what business 
context, the team is able to make more context-specific technical decisions to 
support the customer need. The business context and reason may be inher-
ited from the story map or idea itself if properly explained.
There are a number of benefits for grooming sessions. Since grooming typi-
cally occurs prior to working on the requirement, it allows time for the new 
work to “sink in” and to mitigate risks, and it gives the PO time to address 
unanswered questions. It also provides a short window of where the work is 
headed.
During grooming, the focus should be on the higher-priority work for the 
simple reason that it is better to put effort in the highest-value work and not 
waste time focusing on lower-value work since you may never get to it.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The key focus in backlog grooming is to prioritize and rank order the user 
stories, and then gain more business and technical details of those higher-priority user stories.
The PO is primarily responsible for the grooming event. The PO should invite 
the full team and include others such as marketing and business leaders who 
may have business context. Most importantly, the team can ask the PO tough 
questions regarding specific information and acceptance criteria to gain rel-
evant details about the story.

The Agile Enterprise
205
What does a grooming event look like? It may last a couple of hours when the 
user stories are reviewed in a priority order. Each story may be focused on 
for about five to ten minutes with the goal of gaining a better understanding of 
the work, starting with understanding the business reason for the work. The 
better you groom the higher-priority items within the backlog, the easier and 
shorter the sprint planning event will be.
While grooming, you may focus on breaking epics into user stories, ensuring 
user stories are in canonical form (or a defined form), adding business and 
technical detail, identifying dependencies, understanding acceptance criteria, 
identifying unknowns and risks, capturing what is out of scope, and optionally 
considering sizing (T-shirt sizing of S/M/L or even story points). Finally, you 
may mark stories ready for sprint planning or ready for work.
How Well Connected Are You to Your Work?
A big part of helping employees see the full picture of customer-value work 
is the ability to connect the dots from when ideas come in all the way down 
to the user stories and tasks. This may not be as easy as it seems since enter-
prises are rarely one transparent, end-to-end requirements canvas where you 
can see the full requirements tree in one space.
Do you have people, processes, and technologies that can help you “connect 
the dots” across your requirements landscape? Can you be sure that the ideas 
of highest customer value are being worked on? Can you see the user stories 
that help build the increment of an idea? Connecting the ideas to your user 
stories provide transparency to your work, a view of what work is getting 
attention, and the assurance that the user stories connected to the highest-
value ideas are indeed being worked on.

Collaborating 
on User Stories
A user story is much more than a written artifact; it is a promise for a 
continued requirements conversation.
—Mario Moreira
I was tempted to entitle this chapter “Writing User Stories.” The reason I 
decided against it is the work of creating user stories entails much more 
than just writing. It requires collaboration among the product owner, team, 
customers, and others; it involves communicating the business meaning behind 
the story; and it emphasizes how the user story is much more than a written 
artifact. It is, instead, a promise for a continued conversation.
The Promise for a Conversation
A user story is a piece of user functionality that, when built, can be demon-
strated and exercised. A user story has a before-and-after life. Similar to the 
temporal concept of AD (Anno Domini) and BCE (Before Common Era), the 
user story has an AD and a BCE. The BCE refers to the journey the idea or 
problem takes to get to the written user story, and the AD refers to the jour-
ney it takes to evolve into a piece of working product or service. In both cases, 
that journey should be a collaborative one that includes customer feedback. 
The earlier chapters in this book discussed in detail the collaborative nature 
of getting from an idea to user story.
18

Chapter 18 | Collaborating on User Stories
208
Once the user stories and epics have been identified from the increment of 
story mapping or other practices that decompose ideas, it is time to write 
down the user stories. This continues the collaborative process of under-
standing the user story now that it is written, ergo the saying that the user 
story or requirement is a promise for a continued conversation.
The concept of the promise for a conversation is to move you away from 
“throwing the requirement over the wall” since the real value of understand-
ing user stories is in the collaborative conversation along the way. “Throwing 
over the wall” refers to a practice where one group writes requirements that, 
when completed, are thrown over the wall to a group that has to build those 
requirements with little or no discussion, as illustrated in Figure 18-1.
A more robust approach is to have those who build the requirements be 
involved in the decomposition and grooming process to collaboratively flesh 
out the requirements in a collaborative manner, as illustrated in Figure 18-2. 
This is a mindset shift that recognizes that first-hand and shared information 
benefits the team with an outcome that is more aligned with customer value. 
Having team members involved in story mapping or the practice of decom-
posing ideas provides the team with insight into the customer experience and 
how you got to a thin-slice, end-to-end flow of the idea.
Over the Wall

The Agile Enterprise

Once the epics and user stories are visible from the first increment of story 
mapping, further refinement of epics and user stories can occur, as discussed 
in Chapter 17. This should continue through sprint planning or the next level 
of planning to better understand the work ahead. The collaborative process 
utilizes the brainpower of the whole team whereby each member may con-
tribute to the understanding of the requirement to better shape a working 
solution based on the customer needs.
Collaboratively Engaging the Team
In an Agile world, writing down requirements provides a focal point where 
you can have collaborative conversations between the business and engineer-
ing sides. Whether this is between the PO and team or the customer and 
tester, the importance is that a shared understanding begins and continues. 
This discussion initiates the learning between the business and engineering 
sides where the engineering side better understands the customer value of 
the requirement and the business side better understands the options that 
can suit the customer needs.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The collaborative conversation includes internal people who bring the idea to 
fruition and external people who provide feedback to move in the direction of customer feedback.

The collaborative conversation goes beyond those internal to the enterprise. 
As discussed in Chapter 14, the customers and their feedback loops add to 
the collaboration. The internal focus brings the idea to fruition with healthy 
conversations to understand the customer needs. The external focus involves 
customers to gain their important feedback to determine if you are moving in 
the direction of customer value.
There are debates as to how many team members should be involved in story 
mapping or grooming user stories. My answer has always been all of them. For 
grooming user stories, this is the team. Having the whole team collaborate 
through the process eliminates the need of sharing second-hand information. 
For story mapping, the caveat is that you may do it in stages if there are more 
than ten people involved. The reason is to keep it active and engaging while 
allowing everyone to participate. For grooming and sprint planning, having 
the whole team collaborate ensures a greater understanding and applies the 
brainpower of everyone.
Top Branches of the Requirements Tree
User stories are a form of requirements. The challenge with the word require-
ments is that it may indicate requirements at many levels and sizes, such as 
user requirements, technical requirements, and business objectives. Because 
of the possibility for confusion, you need to be aware of your requirements 
tree discussed in Chapter 15. You need to determine where any particular 
requirement belongs by virtue of its scope and size in a hierarchy of require-
ments. Figure 18-3 illustrates user stories that live in a requirements tree that 
starts with corporate strategy and then has the levels of idea, increment, epic, 
user story, and task.

The Agile Enterprise
211
Since this chapter of the book continues the journey of the idea now being 
decomposed to user stories, a more detailed definition of epic, user story, and 
task as they relate to building new ideas follows.
An epic is the parent of multiple user stories and is roughly equivalent to a 
function, feature, or very large user story that encapsulates a large piece of 
functionality. Epics are typically written by the PO but may be contributed 
by other stakeholders or may result from a story mapping or other decom-
position session. They should be decomposed into user stories before being 
introduced into a sprint.
A user story is the equivalent of a business or user requirement and is col-
lected and managed by the PO. Stories provide user functionality that rep-
resents value to the customer. It should be non-compound and have one 
persona. A user story should be able to be built within a sprint. The next 
section discusses user stories at length.
Figure 18-3. Top branches of a requirements tree

Chapter 18 | Collaborating on User Stories
212
A task is the child of a user story—a very small unit of work—and is equiva-
lent to an incremental decomposition of the user story that the team defines. 
The intent of tasks is to allow the team to incrementally build and test the 
story so that not all testing occurs at the end. Avoid decomposing stories into 
stand-alone design, develop, and test tasks, which emphasize a mini-waterfall 
approach. Instead, tasks of a user story should incrementally build upon each 
other. For example, a user story that builds a search function (for instance: As 
a user, I want to search available mortgage options so I can determine which 
will be the least expensive) can be decomposed into the following:
• 
Create a static Web page to hold my results
• 
Build a simple search with available mortgage companies
• 
Add advanced search capabilities with interest rate 
options
There are other types of work items that should be captured in the backlog. 
Extreme programming introduced the spike solution, which provides a focus 
on solving a challenging technical, architectural, or design problem. Known as 
a research spike, this work may seek the answer to a critical business or tech-
nical issue. Two examples of research spikes are “What database solution will 
the team use?” and “What is the product direction in applying forums?” The 
answers serve to support subsequent epics and user stories.
User Stories
Within an Agile context, user stories are the primary currency used to deter-
mine what needs to be built by the team that represents customer value. User 
stories describe functionality that will be valuable to a customer and user (in 
other words, persona). User stories are the primary topic discussed in groom-
ing and sprint planning. The intent of a user story isn’t to specify every detail of 
the need but to provide enough business and technical detail to have a healthy 
and collaborative conversation about the story.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The user story is the basic building block for a piece of functionality that needs 
to be built. It is the primary currency for the team to understand customer value.
The product owner is responsible for eliciting user stories from custom-
ers and stakeholders and identifying them in decomposition exercises such 
as story mapping. Many others, however, may contribute user stories to the 
PO, including the team and the sales and marketing departments. The PO 
collects and adds user stories into the backlog. Those user stories that are 

The Agile Enterprise
213
rank-ordered highest within the backlog get selected and built within a sprint 
or are the next to be pulled. The attempt is to build user story functionality 
within a sprint or approximately a week time box.
User Story Canonical Form
There are many ways to write a user story. The canonical form is one example 
of a requirements language construct that is geared toward Agile and cus-
tomer value. This brief statement expresses a user story as who wants some-
thing, what that person wants, and why he or she wants it. The canonical form 
transcends process and works just as well for any methodology or process. 
There are three key elements of a user story in canonical form: the persona, 
the action, and the business benefit.
The persona represents a particular user, as discussed in Chapter 14. Examples 
include Erin the Senior Citizen, who uses basic user interface functionality for 
straightforward tasks; Sunny the Gen X-er, who needs more complex inter-
face functionality for sophisticated banking tasks; and David the Gen Y-er, who 
is technically savvy and has simple banking needs.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  There are three key elements of a user story in canonical form: the persona 
(who), the action (what is wanted), and the business benefit (why it is wanted).
The action represents what the personas would like to do with the product. 
This will include an outcome they are looking to achieve (for example, create 
an account) and may include a receiving entity (for instance, get a copy of my 
statement to read on my mobile phone).
The business benefit indicates the value that is gained for the persona. It pro-
vides context for the action and helps with testing scenarios. If I said, “As a 
user, I can create an account” and leave the business benefit empty, why would 
you think the user wants an account? The answer can lead you to build very 
different things. If the answer is “to become a member of the site,” you might 
build a MyPage. If the answer is “to make stock trades,” you might build a trad-
ing application.
When establishing a list of user stories, it is strongly recommended to estab-
lish a user story language construct like the canonical form that helps you 
consistently document the stories, as shown in Figure 18-4.

Chapter 18 | Collaborating on User Stories
214
The following are examples of user stories in canonical form:
• 
As Erin the Senior Citizen, I want to create an account so 
that I can become a member of the site.
• 
As Sunny the Gen X-er, I want to set up my profile to 
include my photo so that my distributed team members 
know what I look like.
• 
As David the Gen Y-er, I want to search homes so that 
I know what properties are available in my price range.
The product owner should be educated in writing user stories in the canoni-
cal form or whatever form is chosen to articulate user stories. The team 
should be educated in understanding what to look for in a user story and ask-
ing questions regarding the elements of the canonical form to better deter-
mine the business need. The PO may also want to educate stakeholders and 
customers on how to provide their needs in canonical form for consistency 
and clarity.
It can be very easy to fall in the erroneous habit of writing long user stories. 
This is often because you want to add more detail to make the user story 
more meaningful. A better alternative is to write the additional detail into the 
body or comment section of the user story, depending on what tool you use 
to capture the user story. For example, it may be as simple as a note card or 
as sophisticated as a vendor backlog management tool.
USER STORY WRITING EXERCISE
Consider the product or service you are working on. Following the canonical form (As 
a <persona>, I want to <action> so that <business benefit>), practice writing two 
user stories to convey a customer need. Explain your best user story to a colleague.

Acceptance Criteria for a User Story
The acceptance criteria are an important attribute of a user story. Each user 
story should have its own unique set of acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria 
answer the question, “How will I know when I’m done with the story?” They 
do this by providing functional and nonfunctional information that helps set 
boundaries for the work and establishes pass/fail criteria for testers to estab-
lish the test cases that are used to test a user story.
Ideally, customers provide these criteria when they articulate the user story, 
but the PO usually writes the criteria, acting as the voice of the customer. If 
the PO is having problems writing acceptance criteria, team up with QA tes-
ters who can draw from their experience to help the PO.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  To write effective acceptance criteria, state the intention, not the solution. In 
other words, state the “what,” not the “how. The team will figure out the how.
To write effective acceptance criteria, state the intention, not the solution. 
In other words, state the “what,” not the “how.” For example, it is better to 
write “The user can choose an account.” rather than “The user can select the 
account from a drop-down menu.” The acceptance criteria are independent of 
implementation details. If the user story is “As Erin the Senior Citizen, I want 
to create an account so that I can become a member of the site,” then the 
acceptance criteria for a user story may include the following:
• 
User is presented with an account creation option.
• 
User must enter an e-mail address and a password.
• 
The password must follow the security policy.
• 
Provide user account confirmation within five seconds.
• 
User lands on the home page after creating the account.
Other Attributes of a User Story
A user story is complemented by several attributes besides the acceptance 
criteria. These attributes help you describe the scope, ownership, and prog-
ress of the story, as illustrated in the story card in Figure 18-5. They may 
include the following:
• 
Comments: any decisions or details that have an impact 
on the “how” to build it based on grooming and planning 
discussions.
• 
Size: a place to include the size, typically in story points.

Chapter 18 | Collaborating on User Stories
216
• 
Tasks: decomposition of the user story into bits of work 
that represent an incremental build of functionality. They 
may be nested in a story or linked as individual children 
records to the user story.
• 
Owners: members of the team working on the story. 
There should be at least one developer and one QA 
tester.
• 
State: the status of the work such as open, in progress, 
resolved, verified, and done.
Do User Stories Promote Conversation?
To get to a user story, the journey occurs both before the user story takes 
shape and after it is written, and it should be collaborative and evolution-
ary. The written user story is a promise for a conversation that helps the 
team both understand and shape the outcome to better meet customer value. 
Ensure you promote the conversation with the team and others.
User stories form the backbone of the work on your team. As you write 
user stories, consider a requirements language construct such as the canoni-
cal form. Including the persona or whom the functionality should be built for 
helps you understand the point of view of the persona. Including the action 
helps you understand what needs to be built. The business benefit helps you 
understand why the functionality is needed. These elements provide clarity 
for the team to build what the customer wants. The collaborative approach 
ensures that everyone on the team understands the customer needs so they 
can better build something the customer wants.

Promoting Agile 
Budgeting
The key to Agile budgeting is being able to adapt at the speed of the 
market.
—Mario Moreira
What makes up customer value is changing at a faster and faster pace. Many 
market leaders have found themselves lagging behind new leaders. Market 
share from a decade ago may have disappeared and been taken over by 
new competitors. As markets change and new customer needs emerge, do 
you have the ability to adapt? Can you adapt your budgeting to the market 
demand, making people and resources available to capture market share or 
prevent a reduction to your market share?
It is important to have a budgeting framework that can handle the shifts in the 
market, turning quickly to the new direction. This takes a combination of look-
ing at your current supply-and-demand system and having the ability to adapt. 
You also need a budgeting framework that reduces wait states and ensures that 
the highest-value ideas get to market quickly. While this isn’t easy, not doing so 
will only make your current position in the marketplace more challenging.

Chapter 19 | Promoting Agile Budgeting
218
From an Agile mindset, you need to apply the Agile principle of “welcome 
changing requirements.” As discussed in Chapter 15, the term requirements 
can mean any level in the requirements tree, from strategy to task and every-
thing in between.
An Agile adoption typically focuses on change to requirements at the team 
or product level. To truly welcome change, ideas must be welcome at the 
enterprise level where ideas come in. This means you do not sit on ideas for 
months or wait for the annual budget cycle. Instead, you welcome change 
and then determine its level of priority in a methodical way. If the value rises 
high enough, it is put in position to get pulled into work.
Moving Away from Traditional Budgeting
At its most simple form, a budgeting framework is a means to establish where 
money gets spent in an enterprise. A good budgeting framework applies a 
demand system like an idea pipeline where ideas collect. On a regular basis, 
it assesses the demand based on customer value and enterprise strategy, and 
then it aligns the supply side to meet the demand.
In many organizations today, budgeting is a yearly affair. Budgeting starts by 
soliciting ideas, often referred to as projects, that are collected over a period 
of several months. As illustrated in Figure 19-1, some high-value ideas may 
have already been in the demand pipeline for up to six months prior to the 
budgeting cycle. Then the idea waits another three months for the budgeting 
cycle to identify and prioritize ideas, another month to get approved, and 
yet another three months waiting to get pulled by a team since their current 
workload is full for the next three months. That means a high-value idea may 
wait for upward of 12 months before it gets worked on.

Traditional budgeting frameworks may have many high-value ideas sitting in 
the pipeline for upward of a year before work begins. If you are familiar with 
value stream mapping that highlights the wait states in your process, you 
will find that in a traditional framework, ideas are waiting around during the 
majority of the process. You literally cannot afford this approach.
If you understand the marketplace well enough, you may realize that a high-
value idea a year ago will not have the same level of value now that it had 
then, and it may completely miss the market window. Additionally, even if 
you proceed with the idea, you may miss the peak of the total opportunity as 
a competitor may get there first, resulting in your market share opportunity 
being much smaller. This is why you need an Agile budgeting framework.
Why Agile Budgeting?
The overall theme of Agile budgeting is for an enterprise to use its money 
more wisely as it adapts to customer needs and the marketplace. This starts 
with having an enterprise idea pipeline and stakeholders that readily accept 
and evaluate ideas as they enter the pool of ideas in the Reveal stage. This 
effectively eliminates the annual budget process wait states that can make an 
idea irrelevant and it helps you optimize the flow of getting the idea to mar-
ket much more quickly, as illustrated in Figure 19-2. In effect, Agile budgeting 
is an adaptive and continuous budgeting framework.

Figure 19-2 highlights that not only will you get the idea to market up to 12 
months earlier than the example in Figure 19-1, you will also much more 
likely hit the market window and get a bigger market share, resulting in more 
revenue for your enterprise. Comparing the traditional budgeting process 
shown in Figure 19-1 to the Agile budgeting framework shown in Figure 19-2, 
from “Record the Idea” to “Pull for Work,” not only will you get the idea to 
market 12 months earlier, you may also actually deliver the high-value idea 
six months before even starting the work if using the traditional approach.
Value-Driven Supply and Demand
As you look across your 5R model, the Record and Reveal stages represent 
your demand side while the Refine, Realize, and Release stages represent 
your supply side, as illustrated in Figure 19-3. The enterprise idea pipeline 
is the pool of ideas in a rank order that comprises your demand, and teams 
comprise the supply of those who can work on ideas.
In a more traditional budgeting framework, a team or division has a fixed 
budget and supply. If that division or team runs out of high-value work, it pulls 
lower-value work. If teams are not lightning-bolt shaped (see the following 
section), then they can only pull the work they are capable of doing.
If no work is coming from the enterprise level, then these teams may create 
work that is often lower value than what is in the enterprise idea pipeline. 
The flip side is that if teams have been given their supply of work following a 
traditional budgeting process, they are often not available for any incoming 
high-value work from mid-year as their backlog is full from the work given 
them from the annual budget.

The Agile Enterprise
221
A more customer-value-based approach is to pair the Agile budgeting frame-
work with the enterprise idea pipeline and lightning-bolt-shaped teams. The 
advantage is that you can use these concepts as a way to ensure you align the 
people and teams (in other words, supply) with the most valuable ideas (that 
is, demand) on a continuous and flexible basis.
Imagine a scenario where the enterprise idea pipeline has a number of very 
high-value ideas waiting in the pool during the Reveal stage. As part of the 
Reveal stage, it is discovered that the top idea requires the help from three 
teams to work on that idea. When you look at the capacity of those teams, 
the third team is full and cannot pull any more work in.
Now you have two choices. You can ask the third team to evaluate if this new 
idea is of higher value than their current work and, if so, gracefully wrap up 
or cut the tail of the work as quickly as possible. Alternatively, if you see that 
the third team is consistently the bottleneck to pull in high-value work, then 
maybe it is time to add people to the team or create another team that can 
fulfill that type of work.

The benefit of having an enterprise idea pipeline is that you can visually see 
high-value ideas waiting in the pool (demand) and the utilization of teams 
(supply). The benefit of having an Agile budgeting framework is that you can 
actually do something about it. You can move budget to the teams that have 
more high-value work flowing their way and reduce low-value work.
Structuring around High-Value Ideas
The primary theme behind an Agile budgeting framework is to use your 
money more wisely by enabling effective investment decisions. Investment 
decisions should focus on matching the highest-customer-value idea (demand) 
with the earliest possible moment a team can work on it (supply).
A portion of an enterprise’s investment will focus on running the business 
activities such as maintaining an enterprise’s critical business operations 
along with maintenance and support. Hopefully, a greater portion is spent 
on investing in ideas focused on growing existing products and services and 
ideas focused on transforming and innovating the business. An Agile budgeting 
framework considers all three areas (run, grow, and transform).
Your goal should be to have all teams working on the highest-value work. 
However, it is not unusual to see some teams working on low-value work. 
Keep in mind that demand, whether in the form of ideas, features, or bug 
fixes, will typically outstrip supply, which is the teams that do the work. 
Because there will always be lots of “work,” it is important to ensure that the 
work that your teams are doing is, in fact, of the highest value.
You do not want to wait until the end of the year to realize that a team or 
whole division is working on primarily low-value work. A traditional budget-
ing framework has teams work through the annual backlog of ideas as new 
high-value ideas wait on the bench, as illustrated in Figure 19-4. An Agile 
budgeting framework gives teams the ability to pull in the highest-value ideas 
so all teams are working on high-value work.

If it is clear that a team or division is the target for a lot of high-value work, 
then it behooves the enterprise to invest more in those areas by adding 
more people or teams in that area. Inversely, if the enterprise idea pipeline 
consistently highlights low-value work for a team or division, it may be time 
to invest less in those areas or adapt their skills toward the high-value work.
Components of an Agile Budgeting Framework
An Agile budgeting framework is a system that allows you to adjust invest-
ment toward high-value work in a timely manner so that high value gets to 
customers quickly. While called budgeting, Agile budgeting is more than this 
as it emphasizes optimizing for customer value over management hierarchy 
and organization structure.
Since enterprises range from very small to very large, how you might imple-
ment Agile budgeting will vary according to your context. Given the complex-
ity of an enterprise, the intent is to tailor it to fit your enterprise. Here are 
the components of an Agile budgeting framework, as illustrated in Figure 19-5.
First and foremost, Agile budgeting requires an Agile mindset where you 
embrace adapting to the market and customer value, you are willing to adapt 
your enterprise list of ideas to the new highest-value idea, you apply the Agile 
values and principles to help you understand why adapting is a very good 
thing, and you incorporate customer feedback along the way.
Incremental and experimental thinking discussed in Chapter 10 is important 
in an Agile budgeting framework. You budget for and commit to an incre-
ment instead of a whole idea. As discussed in Chapter 2, you cannot be 
certain an idea is what customers want until you challenge assumptions, take 
an incremental approach, and gather customer feedback. If the increment is 
of value, the next increment gets budgeted.

The Agile Enterprise
225
Feedback thinking as discussed in Chapter 10 and customer feedback loops 
as discussed in Chapter 14 help with guidance for the Agile budgeting frame-
work. This ensures you validate the increment of the idea with customers to 
ensure you are moving in the direction of customer value.
You need an enterprise idea pipeline or something like it, as discussed in 
Chapter 11. It requires methodical discipline that involves capturing the idea 
in a easy-to-read form such as a canvas, as described in Chapter 13; prioritiz-
ing the idea using a value-based method such as cost of delay (CoD) and CoD 
divided by duration (CD3), both described in Chapter 12; and challenging 
assumptions of the value, as described in Chapters 2 and 12.
You need to have the key stakeholders as owners of value and strategy. They 
should be educated on your form of enterprise idea pipeline, value-based 
methods such as CoD and CD3, and incremental and experimental thinking. 
They should also understand how to effectively challenge assumptions. In 
addition, you need to have lightning-bolt-shaped teams that are able to work 
on several skills and that have experience to work on a variety of work.

You need to have periodic sessions to curate the new high-value ideas as 
they come in. Each session is an opportunity to ensure you are appropriately 
investing in the right areas according to customer value and strategy. This 
may involve challenging assumptions of the idea and determining the disposi-
tion. Those that are low value or below the level of having the supply band-
width of pulling the idea into the Refine stage can be passed for now until 
such time that it becomes the next highest-value idea.
Those Involved with Agile Budgeting
Agile budgeting requires an enterprise to turn its big upfront, event-driven 
process into small incremental and continuous sessions. This can be a signifi-
cant shift for some organizations since it moves concerted effort from one 
part of the yearly calendar and spreads it out across the year.
There may be a shift of roles and responsibilities in implementing an Agile 
budgeting framework. The key stakeholders involved with Agile budgeting 
are the owners and stakeholders of value (for example, product owners) 
and senior management as the owners of strategy. This group may be called 
the Agile budgeting team or whatever term suits your enterprise. Avoid any 
terms with existing baggage.
If there is a portfolio management team, its responsibilities may move away 
from decision making and instead focus on enabling Agile budgeting by col-
lecting data to gauge customer value and sharing it with the Agile budgeting 
team. A portfolio management team can help those evaluating an idea and its 
value by considering strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (also 
known as SWOT) as well as focusing on the trade-offs of comparing ideas 
that may increase revenue, protect revenue, reduce costs, and avoid costs as 
discussed in Chapter 12.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  An Agile budgeting framework attempts to avoid HiPPO (highest paid person's 
opinion) for prioritization as this lacks discipline in understanding customer value.
If there is a project management office, the responsibilities may move from 
ownership of the work to enabling Agile budgeting focusing on dependency 
management among the ideas. The key take-away is that the decision makers 
of a customer-value-driven approach, the owners of value, become the driv-
ers of an Agile budgeting framework.
Avoid making a new idea the highest priority because someone says so. An 
Agile budgeting framework attempts to avoid prioritization based on HiPPO 
(highest paid person's opinion), as discussed in Chapter 12, where a senior 

The Agile Enterprise
227
manager makes priority calls based on his or her opinion. This can lead to 
chaos and a lack of understanding where the higher-value work resides. 
While the Agile budgeting framework helps you more quickly course-correct 
toward customer value, it can be prone to chaos if many course changes 
occur with little discipline in understanding customer value.
In the spirit of ownership and self-organization, as enterprises move respon-
sibility to the level that has the most information typically across the enter-
prise onto teams, senior management should have more time to evaluate 
ideas based on value and alignment to strategy.
Lightning-Bolt-Shaped Teams
An Agile budgeting framework can initiate a need for how an enterprise is 
structured and how employees are educated. Since customer value changes 
over time, it requires an enterprise and its employees to adapt to that change. 
The goal is to be able to move the high-value work readily and quickly with-
out extensive reorganizations of the enterprise. The key is to avoid overly 
rigid and inflexible enterprise structure.
An Agile mindset focuses on optimizing for customer value rather than for 
the rigidity of enterprise structure. This is why concepts like holocracy, dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, can help make enterprise structure more adaptable to 
customer value. Organizing by team vs. division may provide some insight on 
how to create an Agile enterprise. Avoid reorganizing arbitrarily when value 
is focused in another division. Any organization change should be methodical 
and based on customer value data.
While reorganizing an enterprise can help it align to customer value, another 
approach is to extend team skills so that you can experiment with and apply 
the “move work to the team” approach. This advocates an investment in 
building lightning-bolt-shaped teams willing to learn more. These are teams 
where each team member has a primary skill, secondary skill, and tertiary 
skill as it relates to the work.
The shape of a three-pronged lightning bolt has one spike going deep (primary 
skill) and at least two additional spikes of lesser depth (secondary and tertiary 
skills), as illustrated in Figure 19-6. The purpose of having various depths of 
skills is for the team to be able to handle a broader range of work and for 
team members to be able to step up and fill gaps that other team members 
may not have or need help with.

Chapter 19 | Promoting Agile Budgeting
228
To create a lightning-bolt-shaped team takes an investment in education to 
instruct each team member in a secondary and tertiary skill. For example, 
developers have a primary skill of programming code. As a secondary skill, 
they learn how to build database schemas and, as a tertiary skill, they learn 
to write unit tests and run test cases. As another example, developers 
have a primary skill of programming front-end user interfaces in HTML and 
JavaScript, a secondary skill programming API routines and protocols, and a 
tertiary skill writing back-end applications in Ruby and Python.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Agile budgeting framework with the enterprise idea pipeline and lightning-
bolt-shaped teams provides a way to ensure you align teams (supply) with the most valuable ideas 
(demand) on a continuous and flexible basis.
The long-term benefit is that if the team members can develop additional 
skills, there is a greater likelihood that a team can work on a much wider 
range of ideas while being kept together longer, allowing the organization to 
gain the benefits of a high-performing team. This can reduce disrupting high-
performing teams and increase the ability to build high-quality ideas.
Guidance to Tailor Your Framework
Agile budgeting requires an enterprise to turn its big upfront, event-driven 
process into a small, incremental, continuous process. This can be a big shift 
for some organizations. It is best to avoid a big-bang approach when moving 
to an Agile budgeting framework. If you have an annual budget process that 
is being used, it is best to pick the next quarter to get started. In this first 
quarter, allow yourself the three months to experiment with an Agile bud-
geting framework and tailor it to your enterprise.
Figure 19-6.  Infusing teams with a lightning-bolt set of skills

The Agile Enterprise
229
Review the “Components of an Agile Budgeting Framework” section and 
use the time in this first quarter to experiment and set up the framework. 
Remember, since your enterprise size and complexity is unique, how you 
might implement Agile budgeting will vary according to your context.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  It is important to spend a quarter to experiment with the Agile budgeting 
framework to tailor it for your enterprise and gain some experience with it.
In this first quarter, introduce education for key stakeholders as owners 
of value and strategy (Agile budgeting team) on what is Agile budgeting, 
including the Agile mindset focusing on getting to customer value and the 
Agile values and principles. Conduct a separate session on incremental and 
experimental thinking with a special focus on challenging assumptions, Cost 
of Delay (CoD), and CoD divided by duration (CD3). This session should 
include discussions on feedback thinking and establishing customer feedback 
loops to validate customer value along the way.
Introduce the enterprise idea pipeline and the way you plan to capture the 
idea (for example, canvas) and value (for instance, CoD and CD3). Set up 
your enterprise idea pipeline and decide what you plan to call it within your 
enterprise context. This setup includes moving your current-and-not-yet-
acted-upon ideas to the board that makes up your enterprise idea pipeline.
With a small group, preferably product owners, attempt to calculate a CoD 
and CD3 value for each idea. Include a list of assumptions used to calculate 
CoD and CD3. Once you complete this with a subset of ideas (less than 20 
ideas), share with the Agile budgeting team.
Set up a working session with the Agile budgeting team to walk through 
each idea in a rank order according to the CD3 value score. Share your 
assumptions. Ask the Agile budgeting team to use open-ended questions to 
challenge assumptions. These may include the following: What led you to 
that conclusion? What do you think the level of uncertainty is? What is your 
riskiest assumption? and What information do you need to validate this? This 
last question is critical and can help you consider the focus of your first incre-
ment of an idea and feedback loops to help you validate customer value. This 
is the time to wrestle with and understand this framework.
As people challenge assumptions or present the value scores, listen for peo-
ple attempting to get their ideas in their area or division to have higher value 
scores. This is where the mindset of focusing on customer value becomes 
important. The objective is to optimize for the greater good of the enter-
prise and not sub-optimize for a particular division or individual.

Chapter 19 | Promoting Agile Budgeting
230
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The tricky part is transitioning from the old budgeting framework to the Agile 
budgeting framework. Ensure you optimize for the greater good of the enterprise.
After a couple of sessions with the Agile budgeting team, you will have an 
updated list of rank-ordered ideas according to value where assumptions 
have been challenged. Now start the ignition of the Agile budgeting frame-
work. Share top ideas with teams that would work on the ideas. This is the 
transition from the old framework to the Agile budgeting framework. Ask 
the team(s) when they think they can pull a high-value idea, cut an increment, 
and begin validating the customer value.
What you may encounter is that the some teams have a backlog of ideas and 
work that is overflowing. The POs of those teams will need to make value 
calls as to what is more important—the existing work or the new work. 
Often you may find that the existing work, while deemed important, has a 
lower value than the new work. Expect healthy debates.
AGILE BUDGETING FRAMEWORK EXERCISE
Select three of your current-yet-not-acted-upon ideas. Calculate a CoD and CD3 value 
for each idea. Record the assumptions you used to calculate the CoD and CD3. Once 
complete, share this with someone who is an owner of value (for example, PO) and 
explain the value and assumptions. Ask that person to challenge assumptions using 
open-ended questions. How did the session go?
Cadence for Curating Ideas
Once you have a good handle on your Agile budgeting framework and have 
tailored it to your enterprise, it is time to begin a periodic cadence for curat-
ing the ideas. Identify a schedule to hold the Agile budgeting sessions based 
on the pace of ideas coming in. While many ideas may come in, a healthy 
session evaluates just the higher-value ideas, as these are more likely to be 
worked in the near future.
You need to identify the owners of value and strategy (that is, the Agile 
budgeting team). You may find there are more people in the session that are 
necessary. If possible, you need to keep the participants to fewer than 12 
who can speak. Otherwise, the session can become unwieldy.

The Agile Enterprise
231
These sessions are an opportunity to ensure you are appropriately investing 
in the areas according to customer value and strategy. Ideas that are of lesser 
value can be passed until they become the next highest value. These sessions 
also provide an opportunity to view the measures that help you maintain a 
healthy Agile budgeting framework. Agile success measures are discussed in 
detail in Chapter 20.
Do You Invest in the Highest Value?
An Agile budgeting framework is more than just a budget process. It is a 
mindset that embraces incremental, experimental, and feedback thinking; 
lightning-bolt-shaped teams; an enterprise idea pipeline prioritized by cus-
tomer value; and validated by feedback loops. This enables you to adapt to 
the changing demands of the customer and marketplace. Equally important is 
that you can get your idea to market a lot quicker by avoiding the wait states 
that a traditional annual budgeting process presents.
As markets change and new markets emerge, do you have the ability to adapt 
quickly toward high-value work? Do you have a flexible budget and invest-
ment framework where you can move the highest-value ideas (demand) to 
teams and resources (supply)? Is your framework optimized to reduce wait 
states and time to market to get the value to market quickly? While this isn’t 
easy, not doing so can make your position in the marketplace more challeng-
ing. Instead, lead with high-value, short-wait states and an Agile budgeting 
framework to benefit your customers and your business success.

Applying 
Agile Success 
Measures
With any measures, you either use them or lose them.
—Mario Moreira
Measures and metrics can be challenging because they can be both dangerous 
and helpful. By dangerous, I mean that if you measure the wrong thing, it can 
set you in the wrong direction and people can rig the measures if they think 
they will be used against them. They are helpful when you measure outcomes 
over output, as successful business outcomes are what you are looking for. 
They are also helpful for better decision making.
This chapter is not intended to be an inclusive set of Agile measures. It is 
meant to provide you with enough information to get started in building 
your measurement framework and use it to determine if you are successfully 
delivering customer value. Focusing on customer value means that you need 
metrics that help you gauge if you are moving in the direction of customer 
value. It may also mean that many of your current metrics may not be of 
value or certainly have a lesser value. Also, you should only keep those met-
rics that you actually use for decision making and navigation.

Outcomes Matter
The primary goal of Agile measures is to help you become more aligned with 
delivering customer value. This is why outcome-based measures are much 
more aligned with Agile than output measures. Output measures focus on 
how much you delivered, while outcome measures focus on the results of 
what you deliver. It is the results that matter.
Outcome-based measures are drivers to help you understand business suc-
cess. You may still need output measures to help you on your way; just 
ensure that they are relevant to help you determine if you are reaching the 
outcomes you are looking for.
As discussed in Chapter 3 and illustrated in Figure 3-3, output may count 
the number of releases while outcome is how many more customers either 
bought or used the product from release to release. If sales or usage is low 
even though the number of releases is high, it's the sales or usage that matter. 
Often people focus on outputs because they tend to be easier to measure or 
are a carryover from a more traditional mindset.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Outcome-based metrics change our perspective from an internal one to a 
customer or external perspective.
An outcome focus changes your perspective from an internal one to a cus-
tomer or external perspective. This allows you to better understand what 
you are aiming for in the customer-value-driven world you need to establish.
Another reason to include the Reflect stage to create a 6R model (as dis-
cussed at Chapter 11) is that it is during the Reflect stage when the results 
or outcomes come to light. This helps you frame the big picture of delivering 
an idea. It doesn’t begin when development starts working on the idea and it 
doesn’t end when it gets delivered.
Value of Metrics
A metric is only as valuable as your ability to digest it and use it to steer your 
enterprise. Some metrics have a temporary use while others may have a more 
permanent use. You may observe that although many metrics are created and 
shared, only a few of them are actually being used for decision making. You 
have to continually ask what measures can help a team or organization move 
in the right direction? Before discussing suggested metrics, it is worth having 
a discussion of the relative value of a metric.

The Agile Enterprise
235
The value of a metric is defined as its usefulness divided by the effort it takes 
to collect. The dividend implies the metric serves a useful purpose, such as 
decision making. The divisor implies the metric costs, which are the energy 
in collecting data and generating the metric. If the usefulness is outweighed 
by the energy to generate it, then it may not be worth preparing the metric.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  The value of a metric is defined as its usefulness divided by the effort it takes 
to collect it. If you are not really using it to navigate your course, retire it.
Some metrics may have a short life cycle, being valuable for only a certain 
time based on the usefulness they provide. As an example, if an Agile educa-
tion program commences, it may be of value to collect the number of people 
educated in Agile. This provides visibility into ensuring the actual number of 
employees being educated is increasing as desired. However, once you have 
educated 80% of the target audience, it may no longer be useful to collect 
this data and keep tracking this metric.
Because the relative value of a metric changes over time, it is beneficial to 
periodically assess the value being generated. If a current metric no lon-
ger provides value, it is time to retire it. If a new one is of value, it may be 
included if the usefulness outweighs the energy to generate it.
Value of Leading Indicators
Business success is measured in a number of ways. When you think of desired 
outcomes from a customer perspective, it is more products sold or used, 
meaning an increase in revenue. Having a customer revenue metric helps you 
understand whether products or services are being sold.
Capturing revenue is a good starting point. However, because revenue is an 
outcome metric, it is a lagging indicator. To supplement lagging indicators, 
you need leading indicators that provide you visibility into what is currently 
occurring with the customer and the progress of the idea. This timely visibil-
ity is important because it provides input for making better decisions as you 
move forward. Better decision making with timely data leads to an increased 
chance of success and more revenue.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Revenue is a solid Agile outcome measure since it’s about improving business 
results. However, it is a lagging indicator, so you need leading indicators to provide timely visibility 
to ensure you are moving in the right direction of customer value.

Chapter 20 | Applying Agile Success Measures
236
While customer revenue is an important metric to collect, the question 
is, what metrics can you put in place to ensure you are moving in the right 
direction? For every lagging metric, you need to establish at least one leading 
metric to act as an indicator to provide visibility to gauge if you are moving in 
the direction of a positive lagging metric (for example, increase in revenue). I 
call this the lagging to leading metric path.
As illustrated in Figure 20-1, the desired outcome is customers’ buying/using 
your idea (that is, product or service). Since this is a lagging metric involving 
revenue from customers, leading indicators could be the following:
• 
Customers attending demos: a leading metric involv-
ing the demos or sprint reviews. You capture how many 
customers are attending the demo and feedback you are 
receiving. If customers aren’t attending, there is a reduced 
probability that you’ll reach the successful outcome you 
desire.
• 
Customers satisfied with a demo: a leading metric 
where you capture customer satisfaction from the func-
tionality viewed in the demo.
• 
Customers participating in beta: a leading metric 
involving how many customers are willing to exercise an 
increment of an idea in a beta environment.

The Agile Enterprise
237
The value of leading indicators is that they “indicate” if you are moving in the 
direction of customer value. If no customers are willing to attend a sprint 
preview of a product, this indicates that maybe the product is not appealing 
to the customer marketplace. With no customers, you also miss the valuable 
customer feedback to help you adapt toward customer value.
If customers are reporting negative satisfaction in the sprint review, this indi-
cates that the idea is not appealing to the customer marketplace. Finally, if 
few customers are willing to participate in the usage of an idea increment in a 
beta environment, this can indicate little customer interest in your product. 
The key is building a set of leading indicators to help guide you since no one 
indicator provides all of the data you need.
LAGGING TO LEADING INDICATOR EXERCISE
Consider what leading indicators you may want to capture if your desired outcome 
(and lagging metric) is “employees feel ownership of their work” within an Agile 
context. For example, might you want to capture the number of employees educated 
in Agile? Might you want to capture the number of employees who feel they are 
allowed to self-organize around their work? Other thoughts?
Measures for Running the Enterprise
Getting to customer value is a journey. As part of that journey, how do you 
ensure you are moving in the direction of customer value? The answer is 
value metrics. To supplement value metrics, a selection of flow, quality, and 
satisfaction metrics can help triangulate your measures for a holistic view. 
The key is to establish metrics that you will actively use focused on value or 
leading indicators to value. The following is a selection that may prove useful.
Value Curve
The value curve is a way to view the value of ideas being worked on vs. those 
waiting in your pool of ideas. The importance of this metric is to become 
aware of those high-value ideas (in this case, based on cost of delay) that are 
waiting and how much low-value work is being worked on that is causing the 
high-value work to wait, as illustrated in Figure 20-2.

Chapter 20 | Applying Agile Success Measures
238
It can inform your decision making by providing you awareness of the high-
value ideas waiting and aging. When a team pulls for more work, you can 
ensure that the next highest-value piece of work gets pulled instead of apply-
ing the old method, which seems to have resulted in lower-value work com-
ing their way. You can gain more insight of value curves in Chapter 12.
Ideas with CoD and CD3
The ideas with cost of delay (CoD) and CoD divided by duration (CD3) are 
early indicator value metrics that look at the percentage of ideas that get 
evaluated with CoD (or designated value score). A complementary metric 
to add is what percentage of ideas gets evaluated with HiPPO (highest paid 
person's opinion).
These metrics help you know how serious your enterprise is at applying a 
value-based practice to the value of ideas. HiPPO inversely looks at how much 
value priority is driven by a person’s opinion. Figure 20-3 illustrates that over 
time, more CoD and CD3 are being applied and less HiPPO. In mid-January,  
a CoD education effort occurred, which increased the usage of CoD and 
CD3. This is a temporary measure. Once you are over 80% at applying CoD 
and CD3 (using the 80/20 rule), you no longer need to collect this measure. 
You can gain more insight into CoD and CD3 in Chapter 12.

Customers at Demos
The customer-at-demos measure is an early indicator value measure that 
looks at the number of customers attending demos for a team or product. 
Captured during the Reveal stage, a low number of customers attending a 
demo typically indicates either a lack of interest or a lack of actual customer 
feedback, which are both inhibitors to understanding customer value.
This type of measure can help you understand levels of customer involvement 
in demos. If you aren’t getting much customer involvement in the demos, you 
are less likely to be moving in the direction of customer value. Looking at 
Figure 20-4, which product (A or B) is getting more customer involvement 
in its demos? This is a temporary measure. Using product B as the example, 
once it is clear that it is getting customer involvement over a few sprints, this 
measure is no longer needed.

Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is a way to gauge if a company’s products and services 
meet or surpass customer expectations. The benefit of customer satisfaction 
is twofold. First, it may be considered a leading indicator of customer revenue, 
giving you insight into whether you are moving in the right direction. Second, 
it can focus employees on the importance of fulfilling value to customers. 
Customer satisfaction is often reported at a cumulative level. It may be mea-
sured along various dimensions: usefulness of a product and responsiveness 
to problems.
As illustrated in Figure 20-5, customer satisfaction surveys should be con-
ducted periodically to provide a gauge of satisfaction of the company's prod-
ucts and identify actions for improvement. Post-purchase satisfaction surveys 
in the Reflect stage of the 6R model should be utilized to gauge the satisfac-
tion of customers and what specific value the customers found. Because 
there are many forms of customer satisfaction metrics, consider researching 
the various forms and identify what is right for you.

A key customer satisfaction measure is the net promoter score (NPS). It is 
an index that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a com-
pany's products or services to others. It helps you gauge overall satisfaction 
with a company's product or service and the customer's loyalty. In answering 
the question of how likely you are to recommend this product to a friend, 
you typically select from 1 to 10 where a response of 0 to 6 is known as a 
detractor, a response of 7 and 8 is passive, and a response of 9 and 10 are the 
promoters (in other words, those willing to recommend).
End-to-End Lead Time
Often in an enterprise, there are discussions focused on measuring time 
to market. This visibility provides you the rate in which you are delivering 
customer value into production. The challenge is that a lot of the discussion 
focuses on the work during the Realize stage (that is, development). This is 
known as cycle time. Cycle time focuses on the time an idea begins develop-
ment work until it is delivered. There tends to be a lot of focus on optimiz-
ing the Realize stage without recognizing that there may be much larger 
improvement opportunities from Record to Refine.
Figure 20-5.  Customer satisfaction by product

Chapter 20 | Applying Agile Success Measures
242
A more meaningful focus is to measure the time across the end-to-end 
Record to Release stages (for example, concept to cash) along the enterprise 
idea pipeline known as lead time. Lead time is the elapsed time from when 
the idea is recorded until it is delivered. It highlights that it is quite possible 
that there is a lot more elapse time spent in the Record to Refine stages than 
in the Realize stage. The question is, how long does the idea wait before it 
gets pulled into the Realize stage?
Using Figure 20-6, the Realize stage takes three months in both scenarios 
(traditional budgeting and Agile budgeting). In the Agile budgeting scenario, a 
special focus is placed on reducing the wait states typically found in a more 
traditional budgeting scenario, reducing the overall cycle time from 16 months 
to 6 months, a 62.5% improvement for time-to-market even as the cycle time 
in the Realize stage stays the same (three months) in both scenarios.
When companies first measure their lead time, the length of their end-to-
end Record to Release times often surprises them. This is due to learning 
how long ideas are in wait states. It is advisable to establish a lead-time trend 
metric, as illustrated in Figure 20-7, at the product, product-line, or enter-
prise level. A lead-time-trend metric highlights the original length of lead 
time and the direction where lead time is headed.

The goal for the lead-time trend is to identify a pace of change that a cus-
tomer can absorb. For most websites and retail products, it can be quite 
rapid and often a faster pace than what is current. In order to set a goal to 
reduce end-to-end lead time, you should consider leading with education on 
the incremental thinking and decomposition techniques. You can use lead 
time as an indicator for revenue. If ideas are taking a long time to get to mar-
ket, this can have a direct impact on customer revenue.
Customer Revenue
Revenue is a complex term that can be interpreted in many ways. I am refer-
ring to net revenue, which is the amount of money a company receives from 
sales of products and services less negative revenue items such as returned 
items, refunds, and discounts. Although revenue is a lagging indicator, the 
benefit of revenue metrics is that they are a key indicator of whether cus-
tomers find value in the products you are building.
Revenue metrics can be generated at product, product-line, business-unit, 
or enterprise levels. Revenue can be quarterly, as illustrated in Figure 20-8. 
Because revenue is a lagging metric, ensure you create a lagging to leading 
metric path so that you have leading indicators to help you gauge your path 
to an increase in revenue. There are many forms of revenue metrics, so con-
sider researching the various forms and identify what is right for you.

Employee Satisfaction
In the spirit of employees matter, employee satisfaction is a way to gauge 
employees' feeling of contentment within a workplace. Employee feedback 
allows you to engage in meaningful improvement opportunities. Poor satis-
faction can lead to higher attrition rates and low productivity. If employee 
satisfaction starts decreasing, can it have an impact on customer revenue 
meaning that employees are less motivated to support the company and less 
focused on customer value?
Satisfied employees can lead to loyalty and higher productivity. By giving your 
employees a voice, they can express their interests and concerns. Employee 
satisfaction surveys can energize and empower employees, provided their 
results and improvement opportunities are taken seriously. Figure 20-9 illus-
trates a customer-satisfaction metric using COMETS attributes from Chapter 7  
as a framework to gauge employee satisfaction. This example uses a top-box 
approach where those employees who select 9 or 10 (of 10) are very satisfied 
with those areas.

When commencing an Agile program, it is important to gauge satisfaction. 
It can help you understand how satisfaction levels change. During an Agile 
change, while many become more satisfied, some may find their positions 
of control being reduced and become less satisfied. Because there are many 
forms of employee-satisfaction metrics, consider researching the various 
forms and identify what is right for you.
Enterprise Dashboard for Correlation
Once you have a collection of metrics, it is useful to share it collectively in a 
dashboard. A dashboard is a form of information radiator where you display 
your key metrics that help you understand where your enterprise is going. It is 
best to focus on three to six metrics, which should be prioritized by customer 
value, speed, and satisfaction, as illustrated in Figure 20-10.

A dashboard provides at least two benefits. The first is that you can view 
metrics in one place and see them side-by-side, whether on paper or on a 
screen. The second is that you can correlate them to ensure you are not opti-
mizing for a particular metric inappropriately. An example of sub-optimization 
is while bringing lead times down, customer satisfaction decreases. Another 
example is removing all severity 3 and 4 defects for higher quality may inad-
vertently increase lead times.
In an Agile context, a shared dashboard lends transparency to what is being 
measured and helps employees understand what is occurring without second-
hand interpretation. I strongly encourage you to make your metrics transpar-
ent with the help of a dashboard for all to see. Do keep in mind that some 
metrics are captured at different rates—daily, weekly, per sprint, monthly, 
quarterly, bi-yearly, and yearly.

What Are Your Measures of Success?
It is important to consider your Agile measures of success. The material in 
this chapter can give you a jump-start in establishing metrics that give you 
visibility into aligning with Agile and, more importantly, establishing a direc-
tion toward customer value, speed of delivery, and satisfaction. Make sure 
to consider your lagging and leading metric path and metrics that provide 
visibility at the enterprise and product levels.
A dashboard provides one place to view key metrics and viewing them side-
by-side can ensure you are not optimizing for a particular metric inappropri-
ately. Measures of success are meant to help you determine if you are moving 
in the right direction of customer value. These metrics should provide insights, 
help you make decisions, and determine if you should adapt or stay the course.

Reinventing HR 
for Agile
HR is poised to reinvent its role to support an Agile world, the future of a 
value-driven enterprise, and happier, more productive employees.
—Mario Moreira
“Employees matter” is a key principle in Agile, and Human Resources (HR) 
is there to support employees and build an environment that helps them 
stay motivated, productive, and thrive. There are opportunities in the HR 
environment to become more value-added to employees. Much like Agile is 
looking for more of an incremental approach to building products, HR sys-
tems need to become more incremental in the way they approach their work 
so that they can adapt to the needs of the employees as those needs evolve.
Traditional performance management is often subjective as ranking and rat-
ing employees is not always about skills but about how management views a 
person. Also, there is often a lack of timeliness of feedback. If you wait until 
December to highlight a problem from June, it isn't for performance man-
agement; it’s for punishment. I have seen a system where individuals were 
encouraged to compete with each other at the expense of the team and 
overall success. Both subjective performance and an individual-only approach 
are impediments in achieving an Agile mindset.

Chapter 21 | Reinventing HR for Agile
250
HR teams are poised, should they be willing, to take a leadership role in Agile 
and move to the next generation of a supportive environment for employees. 
As illustrated in Figure 21-1, this can include promoting Agile and the discovery 
mindset, experimenting with motivation, exploring self-management, fostering 
servant leadership, getting closer to the customer, facilitating Open Space, 
incorporating gamification, supporting the shift toward Agile roles, moving to 
team-based performance, moving toward continuous employee feedback, and 
hiring Agile-minded employees.
HR as Promoters of Agile
As you move your enterprise toward an Agile mindset where employees 
matter, there should be a shift where HR becomes a coach and mentor for 
employees. While there will still be senior team members and managers to 
grow teams, HR can provide the bigger view of employee needs, looking for 
patterns as they build enterprise employee programs.
HR must be continuously in touch with employees through a number of vehi-
cles such as 1:1s to help grow and coach individuals to Open Space Technology 
activities where dozens to hundreds of employees share their thoughts 
and ideas to support their well-being. HR can be the coach for advancing  
self-management and servant leadership within a company.

Promoting the Agile and Discovery Mindset
HR can promote new programs within an Agile framework and mindset. By 
applying the discovery mindset including incremental thinking, experimental 
thinking, divergent and convergent thinking, feedback thinking, and design 
thinking, as discussed in Chapter 10, HR is in a position to support a trans-
formation toward Agile and the discovery mindset.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  HR can promote the education of the Agile and discovery mindset and include 
it in orientation programs as new employees are brought in.
HR can promote the education surrounding the elements of an Agile and dis-
covery mindset. This education can be brought in as one of the early orienta-
tion programs as new employees are brought in. HR can team up with Agile 
coaches to determine the right level of education and how Agile knowledge 
can be periodically built over time via education and experience.
Experimenting with Motivation
HR can become leaders, innovators, and promoters of experimentation 
within their companies in regards to HR practices. What is becoming clearer 
is that traditional HR practices and programs have less of an appeal to the 
younger population of employees and traditional performance management 
systems haven’t been particularly successful in motivating individuals.
Business thinkers, like Daniel Pink in his book Drive, emphasize intrinsic  
motivation factors over extrinsic factors. Pink argues that the use of reward 
and punishment is antiquated. He proposes that you adapt your thinking to 
include autonomy, mastery, and purpose. It is important for HR leadership 
members to experiment with and experience this new way of thinking so that 
they can identify what sorts of motivation will raise employees’ happiness and 
morale and bring more productivity to the enterprise.
Since there should be a strong focus on employees in an Agile-focused enter-
prise, applying a discovery mindset in HR can set the tone for the behaviors 
that you are looking for in employees. HR may include employees in their 
experiments for what works best in an enterprise. Will 360-degree perfor-
mance reviews work? What type of questions should you ask when hiring for 
an Agile mindset? Do team-based performance goals continue to motivate 
an individual team member?

Chapter 21 | Reinventing HR for Agile
252
Exploring Self-Management
Self-management is a relatively new concept and effectively asks you to think 
of operating without management. It asks you to take bounded authority 
to the level where those who have the most information make all of the  
decisions for a particular space.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  HR can both experiment with self-management within their own groups and 
help an enterprise explore and remove impediments to achieving self-management.
The more predominant alternative to self-management is the traditional 
management structure where top-down hierarchical decision making occurs. 
Within a self-managed enterprise, there are few management levels and 
employees are happy, as they are both self-directed and empowered to make 
decisions. Self-management also leads to optimizing the flow of delivery and 
improvements as the bureaucracy of a traditional management structure is 
effectively eliminated because waiting for top-down decisions from people 
who have less knowledge no longer occurs.
Since self-management has a very real and direct impact on how an enterprise 
operates, it should be an area where HR can have a strong role. This starts 
with HR’s learning how self-management works. HR can set the tone for 
experimenting with self-management. It can explore self-management within 
its own HR group and then help management and teams expand boundaries 
and remove the system impediments from achieving self-management. A good 
resource for self-management is the Morningstar Self-Management Institute.
Fostering Servant Leadership
Providing management with a servant leadership mindset can result in stron-
ger relationships between leaders and their teams and direct reports, which 
can lead to higher degrees of loyalty and productivity. Servant leadership 
focuses on servicing your employees first. Instead of being in front and giving 
directives to your team, you are leading from behind, sharing ownership of 
what needs to be done with integrity.
In their book Servant Leadership, Robert K. Greenleaf and Larry C. Spears 
share ten attributes of servant leadership: listening, empathy, healing, aware-
ness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to 
grow people, and building community. This forms the basis for education that 
can be given to an enterprise’s leaders.

The Agile Enterprise
253
■
■Agile Pit Stop  HR should attempt to identify servant leaders in the company since those that 
exhibit servant leadership often go unrecognized and choose to give credit to others.
In his book Turn Your Ship Around, L. David Marquet emphasizes that true lead-
ership is about giving control instead of taking control. This helps improve 
morale and performance, and it reduces retention. The information in this 
book can be used as an example for true servant leadership.
By learning and experimenting with servant leadership, HR will be poised to 
embrace and promote servant leadership within its enterprise. HR should 
also attempt to identify the servant leaders since those that exhibit servant 
leadership often go unrecognized and avoid the limelight by choosing to put 
the light on their team members. To gauge if you are a servant leader, ask 
yourself, “Am I serving others or myself first?”
FOSTERING SERVANT LEADERSHIP EXERCISE
Identify several managers. Prepare a session on the ten attributes of servant 
leadership (listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, 
foresight, stewardship, commitment to grow people, and building community). 
Facilitate a session with the managers and describe and discuss servant leadership 
with them. Primarily focus on listening to the managers’ responses (both positive and 
negative) to each of the attributes.
Getting Closer to the Customer
As part of the shift toward customer value, HR can promote the two-degrees-
of-customer-separation technique that emphasizes the relationship between 
the customer and company employees, as discussed in Chapter 2. The goal 
is for HR to have witnessed the products the teams are building and meet 
the customers those products are meant for by attending demos or sprint 
reviews and visiting customers who are using products from the company.
The benefit of HR’s having a customer view can help in two ways. First, 
HR has first-hand experience in how teams are working with customers 
and gaining customer insight. Second, HR can use this experience to better 
understand the needs for the employees in the company. HR can then better 
promote how you lead by learning what a customer wants using discovery, 
experimentation, increments, and feedback while avoiding certainty in think-
ing that you know what a customer wants.

Facilitating Open Space
Open Space Technology (also known as Open Space) is a method that 
enables self-organizing groups focused on complex themes or problems in 
a short period of time. Open Space is a way to initiate what is termed as 
unconferences, which avoids a lot of upfront planning. For HR, the theme 
or problem is how to create a better performance excellence or employee 
well-being system.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Open Space is an approach for unconferences to avoid a lot of upfront planning 
and to allow participants to self-organize around topics they select.
An Open Space agenda is emergent as a number of topics may be addressed 
and surface during the start of the session. You can share a theme and ask for 
topics or problems around that theme. Attendees then gather around the top-
ics they feel are a priority and provide thoughts, ideas, and solutions to those 
topics. In learning Agile and Open Space methods, HR can act as facilitators for 
Open Space sessions and support teams who may want to take advantage of 
this method. To learn more, I suggest you read Open Space Technology: A User’s 
Guide by Harrison Owen. Also, to see Open Space Technology in action, con-
sider reading Chapter 22.
Incorporating Gamification
Gamification adapts game concepts to non-gaming situations in order to 
engage employees and motivate them to improve their performance and 
behavior. It rewards employees for completing performance levels with 
points, badges, privileges, and sometimes monetary incentives. While initially 
an extrinsic motivator, it is a way for the enterprise to reward those who 
embrace Agile and the focus on customer value.
The key to gamification is that it must be driven by a clear business objective. 
Within the context of Agile, the goal of gamification is to encourage employ-
ees to become Agile champions and achieve an Agile culture. Gamification can 
be deployed to engage employees in Agile educational elements. Although it 
may start with training, you eventually would like employees acting as Agile 
champions to give back to their community. If you use gamification, ensure 
the achievement is real, it helps employees with their work, and is aligned 
with objectives of the enterprise.

Supporting the Shift toward Agile Roles
In an Agile world, what used to be primary roles in a traditional workplace 
will shift when moving to an Agile workplace. An example is that Product 
Owners (PO) become the owners of value and decision making for their 
products. There is less of a need for project managers and more of a need 
for the emerging roles of ScrumMasters, facilitators, and coaches.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  HR needs to know the Agile roles well enough to explain the roles and offer 
support for those who change their roles.
Middle managers, who may have been the solicitors of the work, will find 
their roles change as the work is now coming from the backlogs via the PO. 
Middle managers, who might be challenged by the new culture that Agile 
brings, are the same folks who traditionally conduct performance reviews. 
Because you are moving from a hierarchical world to a flatter world, this can 
be particularly disconcerting for some managers.
HR is well positioned to be the support for those whose roles are shifting. 
HR needs to understand the Agile roles well enough to explain the roles and 
offer support for those who change their roles. For a better understanding 
of the evolving Agile roles, consider reading Chapter 8.
Writing Goals in Canonical Form
There can be many ways to describe performance goals. It can be advanta-
geous to draft them in as objective a manner as possible. HR may suggest the 
user story canonical form to specify the performance goal.
As discussed in Chapter 18, the canonical form is a language construct used 
to document user stories. This includes the “who” or role (“As a”) you are 
playing, the “what” or your action (“I will”), and the “why” or business ben-
efit (“so that”). Applying the canonical form may help in describing your goal 
more objectively and effectively, as illustrated in Figure 21-2.

Chapter 21 | Reinventing HR for Agile
256
Once you have the performance goal written in this form, you can decom-
pose the goal-based user story to the tangible tasks. You may consider this 
as another interesting way to use the canonical form.
An alternate and promising approach to performance goals is Objectives 
and Key Results, also known as OKRs. The objective is the outcome that is 
sought, written in a qualitative, time-bound, and actionable manner. The key 
results are quantitative, written with three-to-five specific and measurable 
statements that help you know if you have met your objective.
OKRs should be cascaded from the enterprise to the division to the team 
and individual level, getting refined at each level to support the level above. 
In order to allow people to be innovative, it is recommended that only two-
thirds of the OKRs be completed within a time period. To learn more about 
OKRs, consider reading either Objectives and Key Results by Paul R. Niven and 
Ben Lamorte or Radical Focus by Christina Wodtke.
Moving to Team-Based Performance
Because Agile focuses on the team, the performance goals and the evaluation 
should be team-based. In traditional performance review models, upward 
of 100% of the goals are individual-based. Employees with individual goals 
conduct themselves toward the greatest potential for individual reward and 
security. This is why individual goals are in polar opposition to the Agile team 
mindset. HR can help the enterprise move to team-based goals, which can 
only be accomplished by no longer incentivizing individuals to choose their 
success over team success.
It may be difficult to move to team-based objectives immediately for a number 
of reasons. The performance management system may not be functionally able 
to accommodate common goals across multiple people (the team), or you 
may want to maintain an individual-based component to the objectives, so the

As a Product Owner, I will continuously groom and prioritize the Product
Backlog so that the Scrum Team has a list of user stories to work on.

they can adopt the Agile mindset.

specific percentages across objectives may need to be applied. You may want 
to take an incremental approach toward team-based performance. If you think 
aiming for 100% team-based objectives is too difficult, start with 50%. This will 
at least provide some incentive for individuals to work successfully as a team.
Moving from Annual Performance Reviews
Some companies are moving away from the annual performance review 
approach and instead applying more frequent conversations. They are also 
moving away from forced rankings as this supports an individual-based per-
formance system. The challenge with an annual cycle is that it rewards and 
punishes employees based on past performance with less focus on newer 
improvement and growth.
HR can help an enterprise move away from traditional annual or ­biannual 
­performance reviews. A good first step is to transform your performance 
reviews into a weekly or bi-weekly discussion between manager and 
­employees with a more continuous and collaborative approach in discussing 
objectives, challenges, progress, and learning. The goal behind this is that 
employees should never be surprised by a performance review because there 
should be continuous feedback from their manager.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  HR can help an enterprise move away from the annual performance review 
and move toward a continuous feedback model.
These sessions should be low-key and replace the “big-bang” performance 
reviews. There should be an effort from both management and employees to 
be transparent to avoid surprises when ratings or compensation matters are 
discussed. Ultimately, the performance review process should move away 
from the stodgy, often negative and intrusive event and evolve into a continu-
ous and collaborative discussion on progress and employee needs.
Gaining Insight into Employee Progress
When moving to the empowering environment that Agile brings to teams, 
the manager role will have less insight into what an employee is doing. The 
manager must learn that discussions of performance should occur in a con-
tinuous and collaborative manner, focusing on progress and learning.
The challenges are twofold. First, the employee is not taking work orders 
from the manager any longer; instead, the work should be driven from the 
backlog. Second, the manager actually does have less visibility into what the 

Chapter 21 | Reinventing HR for Agile
258
employee is doing since the employee is committed to the team. How does 
a manager gain first-hand information?
During the daily Scrum, the manager may quietly listen to the progress the 
team members share during this brief session. During the sprint review, the 
manager can quietly view employees’ progress by seeing what is being dem-
onstrated. The word quietly bears emphasis. Agile practices are not for the 
manager’s benefit, but rather for building customer value and making progress.
Hiring for Agile-Minded Employees
When hiring for Agile-minded employees, focus on how intrinsically moti-
vated they are. While extrinsic motivators exist such as expecting to be 
well paid or paid equivalent to peers, once you move beyond the basics, you 
should look for employees who are intrinsically motivated by the work.
This may not be so easy. Some employees look at work as just a job. What I 
mean by this is that the intrinsic motivators of these employees are enjoying 
home life, hobbies, and their friends, and they have few intrinsic motivators 
at work. This is not a judgment but rather something to be aware of.
Other employees look at work as their career. While they may have intrinsic 
motivators at home, they have equal intrinsic motivators at work to improve 
their competency in their job. They take pride in producing a quality product, 
and they have a cause to make everyone on their team better.
If you are willing to build a culture where employees matter, having intrinsically 
motivated employees can help you achieve this. The question is, what does HR 
look for when hiring intrinsically motivated employees? Look for thoughts 
around autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Ask them the following questions:
• 
What things are you learning on your own?
• 
What is the last article you read?
• 
What are you curious about?
• 
What are your goals in mastering skills?
• 
What do you think about autonomy in your work?
• 
What role does a customer play in building products?
• 
What are some ways to promote collaboration?
In general, look for things where the interviewees can expand on what they 
value at work, what brings them meaning, how they describe progress at 
work, and what drives them to build mastery. You can learn more about 
intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in Chapter 7.

The Agile Enterprise
259
Are You Adapting toward Excellence?
HR is poised to play a whole new role in an Agile world and in enterprises 
focused on delivering customer value. The annual review of traditional per-
formance management is out of touch with today’s ever-changing employee 
needs. “Employees matter” is a key principle in Agile, and HR can support 
employees and build the next-generation HR environment that adapts to 
employee needs.
Through a combination of promoting Agile and the discovery mindset, exper-
imenting with ways to motivate employees and self-management, fostering 
servant leadership, getting closer to the customer, facilitating Open Space, 
incorporating gamification, supporting the shift toward Agile roles, moving 
to team-based performance, moving away from annual performance reviews 
to continuous feedback, and hiring for Agile-minded employees, HR can help 
employees stay motivated, productive, and thrive. The question is how will 
you adapt your enterprise toward the next generation of performance excel-
lence and human resources?

Sharing an Agile 
Enterprise Story
Storytelling in Agile is a great way to open up a window into how Agile can 
operate and where you could be in the not-so-distant future.
—Mario Moreira
Once upon a time, there was a company called OnHigh, which was doing 
Agile. Well, employees weren’t really sure what they were doing, but they 
were at least following the mechanics of an Agile method. After a couple of 
years, they were seeing some improvements but not really achieving the out-
comes they were looking for. They thought Agile would give them an edge and 
much more business success.
There were a few enthusiastic and passionate Agilists on some of the teams 
who kept trying to move the needle toward exploring Agile beyond the 
mechanics because they were finding that their teams were getting stuck 
on the mechanics. They proposed exploring the Agile values and principles 
because they realized that they pretty much jumped into the mechanics of a 
process without really embracing the values and principles. This helped move 
the needle a little bit. What they learned was that while most employees 
responded positively to the principles, some weren’t ready to embrace them, 
particularly the managers who attended those sessions.
22

Chapter 22 | Sharing an Agile Enterprise Story
262
An Agile principle that some people got stuck on was “welcoming changing 
requirements, even late in development.” Some interpreted “welcoming” as 
being forced to make the change. After explaining that “welcoming” provides 
you with the opportunity to hear new ideas and then methodically determine 
their priority on when and if to do them, most employees firmly agreed with 
this principle. There was still more to discuss.
Initiating an Open Space Unconference
They decided to use Open Space Technology in an attempt to identify the 
common Agile-related challenges in delivering customer value. There was a 
call-out to teams doing Agile to join. The facilitator opened up the space by 
sharing guiding principles and logistics (Figure 22-1).
Participants posted their topics on the marketplace of ideas. There were 
enough ideas posted that three break-out timeframes where conducted. At 
the start of the first break out, participants self-organized around the topic 
that interested them. Participants could use the Law of Two Feet to move 
from topic to topic according to their level of interest.
At the end of the timeframe, the facilitator shared the “Evening News.” After 
three such rounds, the facilitator’s notes were gathered and the session was 
closed. The report summary was prepared, as illustrated in Figure 22-2.
Figure 22-1.  Executing an Open Space session

The Agile Enterprise
263
This led to a fairly clear conclusion. If the enterprise wanted to gain the busi-
ness benefits that Agile can bring, it must get serious about a cultural trans-
formation toward Agile. The good news is that there was a senior leader who 
wanted to become the Agile sponsor. The Agile sponsor allocated money to 
build a small team of Agile coaches. She brought in one Agile consultant who 
had enterprise Agile experience and promoted three Agile champions from 
within the company who were willing to grow further. These coaches called 
themselves the Agile Advantage Team.
The Increments of an Agile journey
The two principles that drove the Agile Advantage Team were focused on 
being customer-value-driven and employee-focused. They used these princi-
ples as a litmus test for all of the adoption activities they considered. Did the 
activity move the needle toward customer value and empower employees?
Since the team was small, they took an incremental approach toward adopt-
ing Agile. This way, they learned from the results of each increment before 
they moved ahead, very similar to the Agile approach taken to incrementally 
build a product. As illustrated in Figure 22-3, they used an adoption approach 
focusing on learning, growing, accelerating, transforming, and finally sustaining 
the Agile adoption.

Learn
“Learn” primarily focused on understanding the enterprise’s focus on value, 
learning about the people (that is, employees), and offering learning (in other 
words, Agile education), as illustrated in Figure 22-4. This started with a base-
line to understand where the enterprise was from an Agile perspective. It 
incorporated details from the Open Space report summary and was extended 
to include interviews from key leaders to gauge the enterprise’s focus on cus-
tomer value and employee engagement.

Value-based questions focused on how value is measured today and how 
that value is validated along the way with customer feedback. It also included 
base-lining existing data such as how long it takes to deliver an idea from 
the moment it is recorded to when it is released. To learn about the people, 
employee-based questions focused on levels of collaboration, ownership, moti-
vation, enthusiasm, trust, and safety, with a particular focus on self-organizing 
teams.
As the coaches were learning about the enterprise, they were providing Agile 
education primarily focused on readying the minds of those who expressed 
an interest in Agile. This involved an Agile 101 session of Agile values and 
principles, what a customer-value-driven enterprise looks like, and an under-
standing of what the current Agile galaxy looks like for their enterprise (see 
Chapter 4 for more details).
The results of this increment highlighted that there was little focus on cus-
tomer value throughout the enterprise. There were a few spots where both 
Agile and self-organizing teams were understood. Also, lead times for deliver-
ing customer value were very long, averaging about 28 months.
Grow
“Grow” is where things got interesting. “Grow” focuses on education and 
experimentation, as illustrated in Figure 22-5. The assessment provided enough 
telling data that the company knew that it needed to respond more quickly 
to the marketplace. The Agile Advantage Team coaches opted to work from 
a pull model where they would initially provide coaching to teams that were 
asking for Agile help. They thought that the teams that were showing enthu-
siasm for Agile were more likely to put more effort into owning their Agile 
change. Coaching focused on helping teams begin experiments in bounded 
authority and self-organizing around the work.

Chapter 22 | Sharing an Agile Enterprise Story
266
The Agile Advantage Team coaches also began their own education program 
focused on helping the enterprise increase customer value through delivering 
early and often, optimizing the end-to-end flow for faster delivery, enhancing 
quality through fast feedback loops, increasing employee motivation and own-
ership, understanding coaching, and learning ways to promote change. They 
did this in the form of an Agile coaching pathway of education where there 
were at least 18 Agile and Value, Flow, Quality (VFQ) topics covered over 
a period of similar weeks. It seemed like a long period, but learning is best 
achieved over time and enterprise transformation is serious business.
Following the pull model, the Agile Advantage Team coaches initiated periodic 
Agile meet-ups within the company. All employees could join and it included 
a specific Agile topic for the first half and a Lean Coffee approach for the sec-
ond half, where attendees decide the agenda. This helped coaches understand 
the topics of interest that fed into the Agile adoption effort.
The biggest focus in “Grow” was experimenting with an enterprise idea pipe-
line model. This involved establishing an enterprise portfolio of ideas and 
applying a cost of delay (CoD) to understand priority and order of magnitude 
differences among ideas. This provided visibility to leadership on low-value 
work being done at the expense of high-value work waiting in the pipeline. 
Education and experimentation with leadership and chief product owners 
occurred around a customer-value-driven model so it could be tailored to the 
specifics of this enterprise. This formed the beginning of a continuous Agile 
budgeting framework.

Feedback from the “Grow” increment was quite positive. Teams liked that 
the education wasn’t just focused on process but covered concepts of value, 
discovery, flow, experimentation, and quality. “Grow” also made it evident that 
there was more demand for Agile education and coaching. The experiments 
in “Grow” were not always successful, but the learning helped adapt the use 
of the idea pipeline and cost of delay. “Accelerate” expanded coaching and 
experimentation, as illustrated in Figure 22-6.
The pull signals led the Agile Advantage Team coaches to expand coaching 
with teams and leadership. They also experimented with a more formal edu-
cation program that focused on employees and teams that wanted further 
education, again using a pull system. They did this in the form of an Agile prac-
titioner pathway (APP) where there were at least eight topics covered over a 
period of similar weeks. The topics included the discovery mindset, increasing 
customer value through delivering early and often, optimizing the end-to-end 
flow for faster delivery, and enhancing quality through fast feedback loops 
(for example, VFQ). These pathways used work-based education where, after 
learning a topic, the cohorts applied the knowledge to their own teams for 
greater learning, which also advanced the adoption.

The coaches began experiments with story mapping for those engaged teams 
to improve decomposition and cut increments that bridged the gap between 
idea at the enterprise level and user stories at the team level. This helped 
employees better understand the requirements tree from strategy to ideas 
to increments to epics and user stories. In addition, since the historical data 
highlighted that many high-value ideas would wait for long periods of time 
before they got worked on, a value stream mapping experiment was initiated 
on several product lines to understand the process efficiency. Efforts were 
then made to eliminate bottlenecks and reduce wait states.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Experiments in the early stages of your Agile transformation are a good way to 
find out what works for you and your enterprise.
It became evident that in order to align with customer value, customer feed-
back was needed along the way. A few of the teams wanted to experiment 
with customer feedback loops. The coaches were happy to support this 
experiment applying the customer feedback vision practice (see Chapter 14) 
to better understand customer personas and where feedback loops may pro-
vide the highest-value feedback.
Since there was a decision to continue with the enterprise idea pipeline and 
cost of delay experiment for the next six months, it was felt that it was pru-
dent to experiment with Agile budgeting (see Chapter 19) to allow a more 
effective means of aligning to high-value ideas (that is, demand) and adapting 
supply to meet this demand. Leadership and finance became part of the group 
that learned and began experimenting with this concept.
Transform
Feedback from “Accelerate” was positive so the enterprise committed to 
“Transform.” This focused on three increments, as illustrated in Figure 22-7.  
The first focused on role evolution, scaling coaching, and education for 
product owners who lead with value, HR engagement, and commitment to 
Agile across the enterprise. The second focused on leadership education, 
dependencies across the work, and measures of success. The third focused 
on scaling education, influencing outside vendors to apply Agile and assessing 
our state of Agile.

The Agile Enterprise
269
Transform One
The first increment of “Transform” started with many teams committing to 
Agile (bottom-up) and leadership committing to Agile (top-down). This pro-
vided a good overall balance of commitment although it was also stated that 
no one would be forced to become Agile.
Now that there were many people keen on applying Agile, there was a need 
to scale the coaching. The Agile sponsor agreed to add four more coaches to 
the Agile Advantage Team. The coaching positions were filled with two exter-
nal hires and two internal Agile champions. They were educated in a pattern 
similar to the Agile coaching pathway.
Education was focused on those that had the responsibility of driving cus-
tomer value, which included product owners and product managers. The 
product owner pathway focused strongly on understanding the customer 
with personas, identifying value with cost of delay, challenging assumptions, 
and establishing customer feedback loops.
Also included was a focus on role evolution as the coaches, management, and 
teams realized that some roles were already changing (for example, needing 
product owners, moving from project managers to ScrumMasters, and evolv-
ing management’s role). HR realized that it had a role to play in role evolution 
and the Agile adoption effort in general. HR took part in understanding the 
elements of embracing employees focused on building trust, learning more 
about intrinsic motivation, promoting collaboration, and so on. HR also started 
to realize the importance of building a learning enterprise so it started taking 
part in understanding the discovery mindset and participating in experiments.

Transform Two
The second increment of “Transform” focused on education for leaders 
(executives and middle managers), a particular focus on dependency manage-
ment across teams and ideas, and establishing and operating with success 
measures. Education for executives and managers focused on a combination 
of understanding their role in an Agile enterprise, how to support the use 
of an enterprise idea pipeline, and how to engage with their teams using the 
language of customer value and capturing feedback.
■
■Agile Pit Stop  Education for executives and managers should focus on understanding their 
role in an Agile enterprise, how to support the use of an enterprise idea pipeline, and how to engage 
with their teams using the language of customer value.
As the enterprise idea pipeline was used, it became evident as early as the 
Record through Refine stages that some of the ideas required effort from 
multiple teams. This led to promoting lightning-bolt-shaped teams so that a 
team could work in more than one area. It also led to restructuring some 
teams to include a more cross-functional set of skills that reduced dependen-
cies on other teams. This started with experiments in both areas with execu-
tives and managers adapting as they learned what worked better to reduce 
cross-team dependencies.
As management played a role in optimizing flow by removing impediments, 
there was a particular focus on the time it took for an idea to go from the 
Record stage to the Release stage (that is, lead times). In addition, there was 
a focus on looking for ways to reduce approvals, hand-offs, waiting, and so on. 
This also included a strong focus by product owners and teams on decompo-
sition and cutting increments of value from the idea.
Finally, there was a spirited discussion focused on measures of success for 
getting to customer value. Initial discussions focused on the importance of 
measuring outcomes over output. This continued with a discussion of having 
leading indicators since outcomes are lagging measures. Primary measures for 
getting to customer value included value curves, driving with CoD, customers 
at demos, customer satisfaction, tracking end-to-end lead times, and customer 
revenue (the outcome measure). Employee satisfaction was also included. An 
enterprise dashboard was established as a means to correlate and understand 
progress, to avoid sub-optimization of over measuring, and to improve deci-
sion making.

The Agile Enterprise
271
Transform Three
The third increment of “Transform” focused on scaling education, establishing 
an assessment that focused on an Agile culture, and influencing outside orga-
nizations to align with Agile.
Now that there were many people keen on applying Agile, there was a need 
to scale the delivery of the education. Since there were a number of local 
Agile champions within the company, they were leveraged to help co-deliver 
the Agile practitioner pathway. Most were very enthusiastic as it was their 
way of giving back to the Agile community. A large number of employees were 
educated in a relatively short period of time.
As the transformation continued, there was a focus on assessing the Agile 
culture to gain an understanding if the Agile adoption was leading to a trans-
formation. The Agile Cultural Assessment Survey (see Chapter 5) was used to 
gauge the current level of the Agile mindset in the enterprise. This was com-
bined with the success measures on the enterprise dashboard (see Chapter 20)  
to correlate Agile cultural alignment with customer focus. Due to the focus 
on removing impediments and cutting increments of value, lead times were 
reduced from the original 28 months down to three months.
It was learned that some of the impediments that were slowing the enterprise 
was the way outside companies delivered to OnHigh. Often, when something 
was provided, it would have to be reworked in order to integrate the amount 
of feedback that was gathered. This led to educating vendors on the Agile 
mindset and the incremental cadence expected in their work. It also included 
experimenting with how to work with vendors in less of a time-and-material 
approach and more of an inspect-and-adapt and incremental approach. This 
helped further reduce the end-to-end lead times.
Sustain
Transitioning to “Sustain” doesn’t mean you are done focusing on Agile. 
However, the culture was focused on identifying, validating, and delivering 
customer value and on teams self-organizing around the work. “Sustain” 
effectively lasts indefinitely, with peaks and troughs of effort depending on the 
shifting needs of the enterprise and leadership changes.
As leadership and employees change, there is a continued focus on education 
and coaching. While levels of coaching support are often less than previous 
increments, a continued focus on Agile concepts, practices, and mindset remain 
in place. After a few tweaks to the Agile Cultural Assessment Survey previ-
ously mentioned, it was decided that it would be used during the “Sustain” 
period at least for the next year.

Chapter 22 | Sharing an Agile Enterprise Story
272
There was also a focus on honing existing concepts and practices as feedback 
was received on what worked better. This included introducing new concepts 
and practices focused on bringing higher value to the customer. Figure 22-8 
illustrates “Sustain” activities. This will continue for the foreseeable future.
It should be noted that each increment of the Agile adoption that led to an 
Agile transformation took about six months. Added up, this was more than 
three years. Transforming an enterprise takes time since it involves a mindset 
shift and new ways of working. Don’t underestimate the effort.
How Will You Write Your Agile Story?
Now it is time for you to write your Agile story. Is your Agile galaxy com-
prised of a holistic top-to-bottom and end-to-end view of Agile where every-
one is engaged? Are you a customer-value-driven enterprise that emphasizes 
learning customer value through customer feedback? Are your employees 
given ownership and do they feel like they really matter?
Imagine that your enterprise focuses on the highest-customer-value work. 
A place where all of the ideas from strategy down to tasks are transpar-
ent and visible so everyone knows if their work is aligned with strategy and 
high-priority ideas. Where employees use 100% of their brain power to self 
organize around the work and be trusted to build customer value. Where a 
discovery mindset wins over certainty thinking. Where managers are leaders, 
leading people with inspiration, vision, and trust. Where customers embrace 
the products and services being built because they are engaged in the building 
of the work all along the way. Imagine!

Now it is time for you to imagine your future. Hopefully, this book has pro-
vided you with many cutting-edge Agile concepts, mindsets, practices, and 
techniques to help you adopt Agile throughout your enterprise. It is time for 
you to write your Agile story. I hope it is one that captures your journey from 
idea to delivery and from the team level to the executive level. I wish you the 
best as you imagine and implement your Agile story.
