HYPOTHALAMUS-
POSTERIOR PITUITARY 
Learning objectives
1. Describe the physiologic and anatomic relationship 
between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary.
2. Describe the regulation and roles of the posterior 
pituitary hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin. 
3. Name the stimuli and mechanisms that control 
Secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin.
4. Describe the causes and consequences of hyposecretion 
of vasopressin.

Oxytocin (OTC) 
 
- regulated by suckling and cry of infant 
 
- increases contraction of myoepithelial cells in           
 
 
  breast & smooth muscle in uterus
 
- “bonding hormone” 
Vasopressin (ADH) 
 
- regulated by osmotic and volume stimuli
 
 
- rise in plasma osmolarity (plasma [Na])
 
 
- decrease of ~10% or more in blood volume
 
- acts in kidney to move water from filtrate (urine) 
 
  to blood to increase blood volume 
  
Neuropeptides

Diabetes insipidus
- Central (CNS) lesion: due to trauma or tumor 
- Nephrogenic (kidney) lesion:
 
1. defective vasopressin receptor
 
2. defective aquaporin 2 channels
PATHOLOGY

Pituitary consists of two distinct lobes (anterior  & 
posterior) 
that have different embryonic origins, are regulated 
separately, and produce different hormone products. 
The anterior pituitary is regulated by negative feedback 
via hormones from the target organs. There are four 
major feedback loops: GH, TSH, ACTH, LH and FSH. 
The posterior pituitary secretes neuroendocrines in 
response to changes in osmolarity and volume or to 
mechanical sensation. There are two major feedback 
loops: vasopressin & oxytocin.
