In this article, we discuss in further
detail the significance
of potentials
in the quantum
theory, and in
so doing, we answer a number
of arguments
that have been raised against the conclusions
of our erst paper
on the same subject. We then proceed to extend our treatment
to include the sources of potentials
quantum-
mechanically,
and we show that when this is done, the same results are obtained as those of our first paper,
in which the potential
was tal-en to be a specified function
of space and time. In this way, we not only
answer
certain additional
criticisms that have been made of the original treatment,
but we also bring out
more clearly the importance
of the potential
in the expression
of the local character of the interaction
of
charged particles and the electromagnetic
field.
1. INTRODUCTION
'N a previous paper, ' ' we have given several examples
- - showing
that
in
the
quantum
theory,
electro-
magnetic
potentials
have a further
kind of significance
that
they
do not possess
in classical
theory;
viz. , in
certain
kinds
of multiply-connected
field free regions
of space and time, the results
of interference
and scat-
tering experiments
depend on integrals
of the potentials,
having
the form
(where
the integration
is carried out over a circuit in
space and time). This dependence
is present
even when
the electrons are prevented
by a barrier
from
entering
the
regions, in which
the fields
have nonsero
values
On
th. e
other
hand,
according
to
classical
theory,
no
such
dependence
of physical
results
on
the
potentials
is
possible,
if the electrons
are confined
to a Geld-free
multiply-connected
regions of the type described above.
Since the above paper was published,
several experi-
mental
confirmations
of the predicted
dependence
of
electron interference
on potentials
have been obtained.
First, it was shown by Werner and BrilP that, in order
to explain the absence of fringe shifts in certain experi-
ments that had been carried out under conditions
where
there
were appreciable
60-cycle stray magnetic
Gelds,
one had to take into account the sects of the potentials,
which just compensated
those of the fields. Secondly,
an experiment
has been carried out by Chambers, ' in
which the Qux was supplied
by a very fine magnetized
iron "whisker" (about 0.75 p, in diameter).
An electrical

(London)

on the basis of a semiclassical
treatment,
obtained
some of our results; viz. , the prediction
of a
fringe
shift
due to magnetic
vector
potentials
in a 6eld-free
multiply-connected
region.

bi-prism
was used to separate
the beam into two parts,
which
passed
on the two sides of the whisker
without
contact. The resulting
interference
observations
con-
firmed
the existence
of a fringe
shift, as predicted
by
the
theory.
Thirdly,
Marton
and
his
collaborators'
have reported
an experiment
similar
to that of Cham-
bers in its essential points, and they too obtained fringe
shifts,
as
predicted.
Finally,
Boersch
et
al.6 have
studied
the
interference
patterns
of fast
electrons
passing
through
thin
ferromagnetic
layers,
and
have
likewise
confirmed
that, as predicted,
vector potentials
have a direct effect on the fringes.
Although
all of the above experiments
are in agree-
ment
with
the
theory,
none
of them
constitutes
an
ideal
confirmation.
For, in
each
case,
the
eGect
of
vector potential
was mixed up with that of magnetic
fields, so that the theory
was confirmed
only insofar as
it was seen that in order to account for the total effect
it is necessary
to take the inhuence
of the potentials
into
account.
The
experiments
with
whiskers
are,
however,
potentially
capable
of providing
an
ideal
test, provided
that the magnetization
of the whiskers
can be made
sufficiently
uniform,
so that
all stray
fields
in the region
of the beam
may
be reduced
to
negligible
values.
The existence
of effects of potentials
on electrons
confined
to
field-free
multiply-connected
regions
of
space
and
time
seems
to have
been
regarded
with
surprise
by
some
physicists.
If one
reQects
on this
problem
for a while,
however,
one will see that there
is in reality
no reason
whatsoever
to be surprised
at
this possibility.
For a similar
eGect arises in the much
more
common
case
of the
stationary
states
of an
electron
in an atom.
As is well known,
according
to
classical mechanics,
any orbit should be possible in such
an atom. According
to quantum
theory,
however,
the
energy
levels
are restricted

the Bohr-Sommerfeld

where the integral
is taken around
a closed orbit and e
is an integer. If we were to take the classical point of
view
and
to
require
that
any
such
restriction
be
explained
by a force, then we would be presented
with
an incomprehensible
problem.
For the forces known
to
be present
in an atoxn simply
would
not constrain
an
electron,
moving
in a certain position
in its orbit at a
given
moment
of time,
to one of a set of possible
orbits that
depends
on an integral
of its momentum
over the entire orbit in question. If we note, however,
that the electron also has a wavelike
aspect, the reason
for this constraint
is quite
evident,
since an integral
number
of waves
must
ftt in a circuit
(or, in other
words, the wave function
must be single valued).
And,
of course, it is this requirement
that
is really at the
root of the Bohr-Sommerfeld
condition. ~
If then,
we are ready to accept the fact that there
exist characteristically
quantum-mechanical
phenomena
such as discrete
energy
levels
(as well as interference
and diffractive
scattering),
we are, in effect, admitting
that the concept of force is not adequate
for treating
the basic properties
of an atom. It is not very much of
a further
step to add that the concept of force is also
not adequate
for treating
electromagnetic
interactions.
Or to put the same argument
in more precise
terms,
we note that as the behavior
of the electron
depends
on integrals
of the action, j'p. dq, in a way that would
not occur according to classical mechanics,
so it depends
on integrals
of potential,
which would
likewise have no
such implications
classically. And indeed, in both cases,
this dependence
has basically
the same origin, viz. , the
quantum
conditions as given in terms of the "canonical"
momentum,
p =mv+ (e/c) A (x),
which
are
(in
the
correspondence
limit of high quantum
numbers)
y dg=
mv

x
dx.
We see then
that
the integral
of potential,
j'A dx,
plays a part in the quantum
condition,
which
supple-
ments
the
corresponding
integral,
gmv. dx
of
the
"physical" momentum,
mv. This means that the very
existence
of quantum
conditions
demands
that
po-
tential
integrals, gA dx, must have a physical
signifi-
cance which
they
do not have in classical mechanics.
{For example,
they
inhuence
the
eigenvalues
of the
Hamiltonian
which contains the kinetic energy operator
r=-,'me'=
t p—(e/c) Aj /2m).
The notion
of force has in the quantum
theory
at
best a very
indirect
meaning.
Thus,
one can define
' D. Boirm, Quantum
Theory
(Prentice-Hall,
Englewood
Cliffs,
New Jersey, 1951),see Chap. 2.
where P is the electron
wave function,
U is the non-
electrostatic
part
of the
potential,
h= —Vg
is the
electric field, X=VXA is the magnetic
field, and
v is
the velocity
operator
of the electron. In spite
of the
formal similarity
of the above equation
to the classical
Lorentz
equation,
dmv/dt =—VU—el—(e/c) (v &&K),
nevertheless
there is a very fundamental
difference
in
its physical
significance.
For all the quantities
entering
into
the
classical
equation
(E, K,
v, etc.) can
be
determined
experimentally
and
are
defined
mathe-
matically
in a way that does not require
the introduc-
tion of the potential
(which
is, in fact, only a mathe-
matically
convenient
procedure
in
classical
theory).
In the
quantum
theory,
however,
the average
force
depends,
as can be seen from Eq. (5), on the precise
form of the wave
function
which,
in general,
can be
obtained
only by solving
Schrodinger's
equation
(e.g.,
if one is given the fact that the system
is in a certain
stationary
state of energy, E, one must
solve for the
corresponding
eigenfunction,
lt e(x), of the Hamiltonian
operator).
Now it is well-known
that
the potentials
must
appear
in Schrodinger's
equation,
because
there
is no way in quantum
mechanics
to express the inter-
action
of the electron
with
the electromagnetic
field
solely
in terms
of field quantities.
The tease fzznction
entering
into
Eq.
(5) for
the
awrage
force
therefore
cannot, in general,
be hnoton
unless
orze first
hnotos
the
potentials.
Thus,
in quantum
mechanics,
force is an
extremely
abstract
concept,
having
at best a highly
indirect
significance,
which
is
of
only
secondary
importance. '
It is clear that at least in the mathematical
theory of
the quantum
mechanics,
the electromagnetic
potentials
(and not the fields) are what play a fundamental
role
in the expression
of the laws of physics.
Nevertheless,
it seems that physicists
have generally
been reluctant
to accept the notion that potentials
also have a more
fundamental
physical
signi6cance
than
that
of the
fields. This reluctance
is grounded
in part on a tendency
to regard force as a fundamental
concept in quantum
theory,
a tendency
that,
as we have
seen, cannot
be
justified. It is also grounded
in part, however,
on the
invariance
of all physical
quantities
to gauge transfor-
mation,
A„=A„'+Of/Bo &,
where f is
an
arbitrary
continuous
and
single-valued
scalar
function.
This
invariance
implies that even when the physical state of
the system
is completely
speci6ed,
the potentials
are
still arbitrary
to within
such a gauge
transformation.
It is therefore
argued that the potentials
do not have a

insofar.
as they
determine
the
6eld
quantities,
F„,= BA„/Bh" —
BA„/Bh&; which latter are invariant
to
such a transformation.
Although
we
must
accept
that
gauge
invariance
implies
that the value
of a potential
at a given point
has by itself no direct physical
significance,
it does not
necessarily
follow that the physical
significance
of the
potentials
is always
exhausted
by that
of the
fields
which
they define. For, as we have seen, it is possible
to conlne
the electron
to multiply
connected
regions
of space by means
of suitable
potential
barriers,
and
the
behavior
of electrons
thus
confined
depends
on
integrals
of the potential gA „Ch&, which are physically
significant
even when all fields in the regions in question
vanish.
These
integrals
are
gauge
invariant
so that
they are not subject to the arbitrariness,
in relation to
the physical state, which the potentials
themselves
have.
It is true, of course, that i n a simply
connected region
the integral
+A„dh& is identically
equal to the integral
1"F„„dSI""of the field quantities
F„„,taken
over the
surface
(whose elements
are dS&"), which the circuit of
the potential
integrals
encloses. One might therefore be
led to conclude
that
there
is no additional
physical
content in the potential
integrals
that is not already
in
the
field variables.
However,
we must
keep
in mind
that
the
quantum
theory
as it
is now
formulated
requires
that
the interaction
of electron
with
electro-
magnetic
field must
be a local one (i.e., the field can
operate
only
where
the charge is). Therefore,
in the
description
of this
interaction,
only
those
quantities
which
differ from zero in the region
accessible to the
electron can account for observable
physical
effects on
the
electron.
As a result,
when
the
electron
is thus
confined
to a multiply
connected
region,
the fields in
the excluded region (which appear in the above identity,
between
field
and
potential
integrals)
cease
to
be
relevant
for the problem
under
discussion.
The observ-
able
physical
effects
in
question
must
therefore
be
attributed
to the potential
integrals
themselves,
Such
integrals,
being
not
only
gauge
invariant,
but
also
Hermitian
operators,
are perfectly
legitimate
examples
of quantum-mechanical
observables.
They
represent
extended
(nonlocal)
properties
of the field, which
are
evidently
directly
measurable
in the region in question
with the aid of the observable
properties
(interference,
diffractive
scattering,
and
energy
levels)
of electrons
confined to this region.
Although
the above
point
of view
concerning
po-
tentials
seems to be called for in the quantum
theory
of the electromagnetic
field, it must be admitted
that
it is rather unfamiliar.
Various of its aspects are often,
therefore,
not very clearly understood,
and as a result,
a great
many
objections
have
been
raised
against
it
(some of them in the published
literature,
and some of
them in private
communications
to the authors).
Such
objections
have
appeared
so frequently
that
we feel
that it would be useful to answer
them systematically,
and in so doing, to present certain further developments
concerning
the theory
of the
effects of potentials
in
quantum
mechanics.
The objections
mentioned
above
fall
roughly
into
two types. In the first type, it is accepted
that
the
potentials can be expressed in the one-body Schrodinger's
equation
as definite functions
of space and time, as we
did in our first article.
On this foundation,
however,
various
points
are raised
which
call some of our con-
clusions
into question.
These points
will be discussed
and answered
in Sec. 2 of the present paper.
In the second
type of objection, it is riot accepted
that the potentials
can be written
as specified functions
of time
and
space, but instead,
questions
are raised
which
would
suggest that there would be a breakdown
of some of our conclusions
if we took into account the
distribution
of charges and currents
(e.g., in a solenoid)
which
are the sources of potentials.
To discuss
these
questions,
we begin in Sec. 3 by giving a theory,
which
treats the source of the electric potential
by means
of
a many-body
Schrodinger's
equation,
and
in Sec. 4,
the same is done for magnetic
potentials.
In all cases,
we show that the results are precisely the same as those
given in our first paper.
In our detailed treatment
of the ef/ect of the sources
of the potentials,
the fact that
potentials
possess
a
physical
meaning
beyond
that
of the
fields
emerges
with
even greater
clarity
than before. Thus it will be
shown in Sec. 3, that whereas the electron does actually
exert force on the various parts of the source in experi-
ments
of the type that
we have
described,
the total
force of reaction
of the source back on the electron
vanishes.
Nevertheless,
the
electronic
interference
effects remain,
thus
confirming
our conclusion
that in
the quantum
theory,
force does not have
the funda-
mental
role that it has in classical physics. In Sec. 4,
where
we treat the electromagnetic
field quantities
as
dynamical
variables,
it will be seen that the potentials
constitute
an intermediary
link
between
the electron
and the charges
and currents
in the source variable.
As in the one-body
theory
(in which
the variables
of
the electromagnetic
field are taken as specified functions
of space and time), it is only with the aid of the po-
tentials that this link can be established
by means of a
localized
interaction
between
charged
particles
and
field (the field quantities
themselves
being,
in general,
inadequate
for this
purpose).
Thus,
we demonstrate
the fundamental
role of potentials
for this problem
in
still another
way.
Finally,
in an Appendix,
we shall
discuss
a recent
article by Peshkin,
Talmi,
and Tassie'
on the subject
of potentials
in the quantum
theory.

2. FURTHER CLARIFICATION
OF EFFECTS
OF POTENTIAL
IN ONE-BODY
SCHRODINGER'S
EQUATION
In this section,
we shall attempt
mainly
to clarify
various
questions
that have been raised concerning
the
effects
of potentials
in
the
one-body
Schrodinger's
equation.
First of all, Furry and Ramsey" have discussed
the
relationship
of the uncertainty
principle
to interference
experiments
such as those suggested
in our first article
(e.g., an electron beam is split coherently
in two, each
is allowed
to pass through
tubes
in which
there
is a
different
time
dependent
potential,
after
which
the
beams
are
allowed
to come
together
and
interfere).
Although
the above authors
did not intend
their article
to be regarded
as an objection
to our conclusions,
it
seems
that it has been
so regarded
by a number
of
physicists. "It is therefore
worthwhile
here to make a
few remarks
about this point.
Now,
as long as no observation
can be made
from
which
one could tell through
which
beam the electron
actually
passes, then there will, of course, be interfer-
ence as predicted
in our paper. If, for any reason, how-
ever,
an observation
as to which
beam
the electron
actually
passes through
can be carried out, then as is
well known,
the apparatus
that makes this observation
possible
must
introduce
a disturbance
that
destroys
the interference
pattern. " Furry
and Ramsey
treated
this point in some detail, considering
a special example
of a measuring
device (a charge),
and showing
that as
a result of its effects, interference
will be destroyed,
as
is to be expected.
Of course,
this demonstration
does
not invalidate
our conclusions
in any way whatsoever,
since by hypothesis,
we are considering
a case in which
the experiment
is done under
conditions
in which
no
such detailed
observation
of the path
of the electron
can be made.
The
above
discussion
indirectly
answers
a
large
number
of further
objections
of a certain general
type
to our conclusions.
For example,
if the electron passes
through
one of the condensers,
then when that condenser
is charged up, the amount of work done by the charging
generator
will be different
from what it would
be in
the absence of this electron. By measuring
this work,
one could,
in principle,
tell which
beam
the electron
passed through,
so that interference
would be impossible.
In accordance
with the preceding
discussion,
however,
it is clear that in order to be sure that interference
will
take place, it is necessary to arrange
conditions
so that
no such
measurement
can be carried
out.
VVe shall
treat this problem
in more detail
in Sec. 3, where
we
shall show that if the generator
is properly
constructed
(so that
its behavior
is adiabatic),
then
no
energy

to the experiment
under discussion.
measurement
permitting
us to tell
which
beam
the
electron passed through
will be possible,
and the usual
interference
pattern
will be obtained.
The second general
kind of question
that has been
raised concerns the problem
of the single-valuedness
of
the wave
function.
In connection
with
this
problem,
the magnetic
example
given
in our first paper
(a very
narrow
solenoid
with flux inside but no flux outside)
is
the easiest to discuss, although
the conclusions
that we
shall give here are true in general.
Since the wave
function
is being
solved
in a non-
simply-connected
region
(which excludes the solenoid),
it is argued that the usual considerations
leading to the
requirement
of
the
single
valuedness
of
the
wave
function
may not be valid
here. For example,
if the
wave
function
were
to be multiplied
by a constant
factor, e', when
the polar
angle
is increased
by
2m,
then
all physical
predictions,
which
depend
only
on
functions
like POQ (where 0 is a Hermitean
operator),
will still be single-valued. ' It is proposed
then that for
this case, the boundary
conditions
on the wave function
might
be altered. For example,
the vector potential
in
this case can be chosen
(in a certain gauge) as
(6)
where
q is the total Aux inside the solenoid, and u~ is a
unit
vector
perpendicular
to the radius.
Then
by a
certa, in gauge
transformation
which
is regular
in the
multiply-connected
region under discussion and singular
only
in the
excluded
region,
viz. , A —+ A' —(q/27r)V&
(where
p is the
polar
angle),
one can eliminate
the
vector potential
altogether,
reducing
the Hamiltonian
to that
of a free particle. If now
we regard
P' as a
proper
representation
of the wave function,
we would
obtain solutions
corresponding
to a free particle. Since
such solutions are single valued in the |t' representation,
they would
have to be multiple
valued
in the original
representation
(P would
be multiplied
by e"&/e when
P was
increased
by
2ir). If such
a procedure
were
legitimate,
then
all effects of potentials
in field-free
multiply
connected regions could be transformed
away,
and
the conclusions
of our previous
paper
would
be
invalidated.
It is easy to see, however, that such non-single-valued
wave functions
in the original
representation
are not
compatible
with
the
basic
principles
of
quantum
mechanics.
For they do not take into account the fact
that the magnetic
Aux can be turned
off adiabatically
and
that
any
potential
barriers
that
surround
this
Qux can, in principle,
likewise be decreased adiabatically
to zero. From the fact that the Hamiltonian
is always
a single-valued
operator
(even when it is thus changing
in time), it is easy to show that if the wave function
is
initially
single-valued,
it remains
single-valued
for all
"The requirement
that P itself be single-valued
stems basically
from
the
demand
for
three-dimensional
invariance
(see, for
example,
reference
7, Chapters
14 and 17). If the region is not
simply connected,
we cease to require this invariance.

time, while if it is originally
multiple-valued,
it retains
the
same
kind
of multiple-valuedness.
Hence,
if (in
the
original
representation)
multiple-valued
wave
functions
were
allowed
while
the barrier
was present
and the Aux was turned
on, they would also have to be
allowed
when the barrier had disappeared
and the Aux
was
turned
off. This
would
evidently
lead
to
new
quantum
conditions
on the particle, which depended
on
its past history
(i.e., as to whether
it had once been in
a multiply
connected
space with
Aux in the excluded
region).
But it is a basic postulate
of the
quantum
theory
that
the
quantum
states
of a given
system
allowed in a specified physical situation
are independent
of the past history of that system (i.e., of how the state
was prepared).
Therefore, it is not possible to transform
away
the e8ects of potentials
in field-free
multiply-
connected
regions by giving
up the condition
of single-
valuedness
of the wave function.
A third
type
of question
that
has
been
raised
is
concerned
with
the
electric
field
which
arises
when
source of the magnetic vector potential (e.g., the current
in the solenoid)
is turned
on. To treat this problem,
let us suppose,
for example,
that in the absence of the
Aux there
is an electron
in a stationary
orbit
going
around
the solenoid.
In the correspondence
limit
its
angular
momentum
is determined
by the Bohr-Sommer-
feld quantum
conditions
$Eq. (2)j. When
the flux is
turned
on, the
resulting
electric
6eld acting
on the
electron
will alter its "physical"
momentum,
mv, and
as a simple
calculation
shows,
this alteration
is equal
in magnitude
to (e/c)A,
where
A is the
final vector
potential
due to the source.
At 6rst sight, one might then suppose that the effects
of a vector potential
have been explained,
as the result
of the action of an electric field, by means of the above
argument.
However,
it is possible to begin the experi-
ment
with
the electron
screened
by a Faraday
cage,
so that it experiences
no electric 6eld whatsoever.
If
the electron is subsequently
released from the cage and
then
captured
into
a stationary
orbit,
the
quantum
conditions
will be precisely
the same
as those
which
would be operative
if the electron had initially
been in
this orbit Land are, in fact, given by Eq. (4), in terms
of the vector potential).
This is just a special case of
the general
rule of the quantum
theory
that
we have
cited
in
connection
with
the
problem
of the
single
valuedness
of the wave function; viz., that the possible
quantum
states are independent
of the past history
of
the system. It is therefore
clear that
the
change
of
quantum
state cannot,
in general,
be ascribed
in this
way
to the
action
of electromagnetic
fields
on
the
electron.
A similar question
has been raised by Pryce,"except
that
he
has
discussed
the
problem
of the
shift
of
interference
fringes,
and has tried to explain
them
as
due
to
the
static
magnetic
6eM.. This
explanation
'~ Pryce's arguments
have been discussed
in reference 4.
starts
from
the
circumstance
that
in the
Chambers
experiment,
the Aux in the whisker
varied
somewhat
in its longitudinal
direction
(which
we shall call z). As
a result, the displacement
of the fringes was a function
of s, so that
the fringes
consisted
of tilted,
(and
in
general, curved) lines. The e dependence
of the flux im-
plies, of course, that there is a magnetic
6eld outside
the solenoid. If one assumes
that the flux, g(s), does
not vary too rapidly
as a function
of s, the vector po-
tential
A=q(z)uq/2~r
will still be the correct solution
of Maxwell's
equations,
to a good order of approxima-
tion. From this, one can calculate
the magnetic
held,
K= V&(A= r(dq/dz)/2~r,
where r is a unit vector in the
radial direction. This field implies a force on the elec-
tron, F= (e/c) (v)&K)= (e/c) (v&&r) (dq/dh)/2vrr,
which is
in the s direction. There will be a resulting
momentum
transfer to the electron of Dp=fFdt= (e/c)f(v&(3!)dt,
where the integration
is carried out over the path of the
electron.
(This transfer
will be oppositely
directed
in
accordance
with the side of the solenoid
on which the
electron passes. )
Pryce then noted that the above-described
momen-
tum transfer
can be used to calculate
the slope of the
fringe.
Evidently
this
slope is determined
by
BC/Bz,
where
C is the phase
difference
of the beams
which
have
passed
on opposite
sides of the solenoid.
Now,
as we saw in the discussion
of the Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantum
conditions,
this phase
shift
(the number
of
wavelengths)
is equal
to gy dx/h,
where
p
is the
canonical
momentum,
ntv+(e/c)A.
Now, consider
the
dependence
of this phase
shift on s, ot the location of
the screen,
where interference is being
detected.
Here
A
can be neglected
(because r is large). The s dependence
of C will then arise only because the two beams have
different
s components
of the "physical"
momentum,
mv. From this difference,
as calculated
in the previous
paragraph,
one obtains
BC
e
z (v)&3'.)dt,
Bs
ch
(7)
where a is a unit vector in the s direction.
We see then that the slope of the fringe
line can be
obtained
from
the
momentum
transferred
to
the
electron
by the magnetic
force due to the stra, y field
outside
the solenoid.
However,
Pryce then went on to
consider a case in which the Aux in the "whisker" has
a value of zero at some point, say s=so, and in which
q(z) rises continuously
to its actual value at the altitude
s. The
total
phase
shift
can
then
be obtained
by
integrating
Eq. (7) from zo to z; viz. , C =Ji,'(BC/Bz)dz
Before
doing
this,
however,
we 6rst
transform
the
integral
in Eq. (7) into
e

using the fact that J'A(sp) dx=0, because q(sp) =0. In
this way, it would seem that the whole effect can be ex-
plained
as a result
of forces exerted
by the magnetic
field on the electron,
so that potentials
are after all not
playing
any more fundamental
role than
they play in
classical physics.
One can show the inadequacy
of the above argument
by noting
the electron
beam
can be limited
in the s
direction
to a region,
As, in which
the change
of Qux,
(Bq/Bs)hs,
is negligible
in comparison
to q(s) itself.
Moreover, it is always possible, in principle,
to find con-
ditions
in which this limitation
of the beam will have a
negligible
effect on the interference
pattern (it is neces-
sary only that As be sufficiently
large in comparison
to
a wavelength).
In practice,
such a limitation
could be
achieved by suitable
slits, but for theoretical
purposes,
it is more convenient
to discuss infinitely
high potential
barriers
which
confine
the
electron
to the
region
in
question.
It is clear that
the fringe
line
in the interference
experiment
described
above
is, in
effect, a map
of
C (s)=+A(s).dx onto
the coordinate
$F'(s)7 perpen-
dicular to s, on the screen. To obtain
such a map em-
pirically,
one could begin by doing such an interference
experiment
at a certain altitude
s, with a slit of width
ds. Then it could be done at a series of altitudes, s+As,
s+2hs, etc. It must be remembered,
however,
that in
a shift of n+h fringes
(where
n is an integer),
only 8 is
observable
with
the aid of measurements
made at a
definite value of s. Nevertheless,
if hz is limited
in the
way described
above (so that there is much less than a
whole fringe shift in the interval 4s), then one can make
an effectively
continuous
map, which
can be extended
over many fringe shifts, and which permits
the integer,
m, to be obtained
by counting
the fringe shifts down to
a point
of zero flux. In this
way,
the function
C(s)
could be obtained
in measurements.
It is clear that the argument
of Pryce applies only to
the calculation
of the shift of the fringe line in the in-
terval
As
I which
is proportional
to (cjC'/Bs)hs7. The
main part of the deviation,
8, of the fringe
shift from
an integer
(which can be measured
directly
in observa-
tions taken in the interval hs) is, however, not explained
by this argument
at all, since the electron cannot pene-
trate
into
the regions
over
which
the
integration
of
BC/Bs fin Eq. (8)7 was carried out. This deviation,
5,
is, in fact, determined
directly by the potential integrals,
„&fA dx, while (as has already
been pointed
out in Sec.
1), the concept of the force exerted by the fields acting
on the charges
is seen to be a comparatively
abstract
one, having
at best, a secondary
importance
in com-
parison with that of the potential
iiitegrals
themselves.
Finally, another point of interest that has been raised
is in connection
with the possibility
that in the experi-
ments
described
here, the Qux is actually
quantized
in
units
of "fluxons"
(1 fluxon=ch/e).
In those
cases
where
stray
fields are present
(e.g., in the Chambers
experiment')
such a suggestion
implies
that
there
is,
in reality,
always an integral
number
of Quxons at any
given altitude,
s, and that this number
changes abruptly
at certain
altitudes.
The stray
field
would
then
be
present
only at these
altitudes
where
the number
of
Quxons
suffers an abrupt
change
of the type described
above.
Of course, as pointed out in our first article, all inter-
ference
and
scattering
experiments
must
vanish
in a
Geld-free
multiply-connected
region
containing
an in-
tegral
number
of Quxons. If the Qux were quantized,
one would
first sight,
therefore,
expect no observable
fringe
shifts
except at those
altitudes,
s, where
the
flux changes
abruptly,
(and where
the resulting
mag-
netic field might
perhaps
be expected
to deviate
the
fringe pattern
in the manner
indicated
by the argument
given by Pryce). Such a discontinuous
pattern
would
contradict
the observed
results
which,
as we have al-
ready
pointed
out,
show
a continuous
tilted
and,
in
general,
curved fringe line. In order to answer
this ob-
jection it couM,
however,
further
be suggested
that
the electron is not fully localized
in the s direction,
so
that it effectively
experiences
a magnetic
field averaged
over a certain range of z. In this way, one could perhaps
hope to explain
the observed
continuity
of the fringe
lines, while still holding
on to the notion that the Qux
is quantized,
and that all observable
effects are really
due to the fields.
In order to settle
this
question
of quantization
of
Qux finally, it would
suffice if an experiment
were done
in which hs were small enough
so that the fringe shift
along its length would be negligible
in comparison to the
deviation,
8, from an integral
number
of fringe shifts.
In this way,
one could demonstrate
that the average
field experienced
by the electron
(which
is proportional
to the slope of the fringe
line) is too small to account
for the observed
fringe shift, 6, so that the assumption
of quantized
Qux lines with discrete changes in intensity
would have to be given up.
Finally, it must be pointed out that the quantization
of Qux is not compatible
with the quantum
theory of the
electromagnetic
Geld as it stands now. Some arguments
have been given with aim of deducing
the quantization
of Qux from the present theory, but these arguments
are
erroneous. For example,
consider an electron
moving
in
a uniform
magnetic
field of strength, P, in the s direc-
tion. The vector potential can be taken as A = Hru&/2—
The
Bohr-Sommerfeld
condition
is +I mv+ (e/c)A7
~ dx=eh. But for a circular
orbit
in a uniform
field,
rnv= (Her/c)u&. We thus obtain
(~er'/c)H = nh, so that

ELECTROMAGNETIC

the flux is rt=7rr'H= rtchje, which is just a whole num-
ber of "Quxons. "If Qux were always con6ned by charges
moving
in uniform
magnetic
fields, then the effects of
potentials
would
vanish
in the way
described
above.
In general, however, the electrons are confined to a given
region by other kinds
of forces (e.g., electric)
so that
the above conclusion
of quantized
Qux does not hold.
Additional
arguments
in favor of the assumption
of
quantized
Qux arise in the theory of superconductivity. "
Even if these arguments
are accepted,
however,
they
would imply at most that Qux was quantized
for super-
conductors,
and therefore
would not hold for the experi-
ments that we have considered.
Of course, there is a possibility
that current
electro-
magnetic
field theories should be modified in such a way
as to introduce
quantization
of Qux as a general property
of the field. In this connection,
the experiments
that we
have
cited
furnish
strong
evidence
against
such
an
assumption.
However,
in order that this evidence
shall
be made conclusive, it is desirable
that the experiment
be done with a suitably
limited
slit width,
As, in the
manner
described
earlier
(so that the fringe shift along
As should be much less than the main deviation,
6, from
an integer).
3. EFFECT OF SOURCES OF POTENTIAL
IN
INTERFERENCE EXPERIMENTS
(CASE OF
AN ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL)
We have thus far been treating
the interference
ex-
periment
under
the
assumption
that
the
one-body
Schrodinger
equation,
with
the
potentials
given
as
specified functions
of space and time, is adequate.
We
shall now show that the same results are obtained,
when
we take into account
quantum-mechanically
the fact
that all potentials
originate
in some kind of source (or
set of sources). In this section we shall discuss only the
case of electrical
potentials
(i.e., no magnetic
fields),
for which the problem is simplified by the fact that these
potentials
satisfy
Poisson's
equation
(in
the
gauge
in which divA=0).
where H, is the Hamiltonian
of the electron by itself.
The Hamiltonian
of the source can be expressed in more
detail as
Hs=g
+5'(
y"
)
z 2M,.
(12)
where M, is the mass associated with the ith coordinate
and W(
y,". ) is the potential
energy
of interaction
of all parts
of the source with
each other,
while p; is
the momentum
conjugate to y;.
We now take advantage
of the fact that the source
consists of a macroscopic
piece of apparatus.
Thus, all
its parts
will be very heavy,
so that it can be treated
with
the aid of the WEB approximation.
As is well
known, "the approximation
leads to an expression
for
the wave function
of the source by itself, having
the
form
0( "y'" t)=&(" y"" t) "{""'""/"

will
be a function,
V(x,

depends
on the y; as well as on

how the various

The above equation

completely
by the distribution
of charged particles at that same moment

the next section, we shall see that there is no analogous
complete determination
of magnetic
vector potential by
the distribution,
of currents. )
Our procedure
will then be to include in a many-body
Schrodinger
equation,
not only the
electronic
coordi-
nates,
x, but also the coordinates,
y;, of the various
' See F. London,

In a typical
state, I'(. .y;.

of a
packet function
(in the configuration
space), such that
the probability
density
is appreciable
only in a small
region
of width
Ay;,
near
a point
y;=y;(t),
which
follows the classical orbit. In view of the fact that such
a wave packet spreads and otherwise
changes its shape
negligibly,
it
can
be
approximated
as
a
function
E(,y;—y, (t) .. ), which
depends
only
on the dif-
ference, y,—y, (t).
"See, for example,
reference 7, page 270.

D. BOHM
Since y; is very
close to y;(/), wherever
the proba-
bility density
is appreciable,
the interaction
potential,
V(
y,",x) can be approximated
as V(
~ y,(t),x).
Thus, we obtain a time-dependent
potential.
Our prob-
lem is then to show that the equation
for the electron
wave function
factors
out of (11), to yield
the time-
dependent
Schrodinger
equation
for
the
one-body
problem
ik
=—
L8,+V(
y, (t) . ,x)]f.
83
If we succeed in doing this, we will have shown that a
complete
quantum-mechanical
treatment
which
in-
cludes the source
of the potential
leads
(in. a suitable
approximation)
to the same result as does the treatment
given in our first paper.
Now,
in a typical
interference
experiment
(e.g., the
first case treated
in our previous
paper, ' with
a split
electron
beam
passing
through
a pair
of drift tubes),
the
generator
of the
potential
is so arranged
that
V(.
y,(t),x) is zero before the experiment
begins,
then
rises continuously
to a maximum,
Anally
falling
again to zero when
the experiment
is over. Since the
probability
density
is negligible
when y; is appreciably
different
from y;(t), it follows that
V(
y,' - x) also
satisfies the same conditions
in the domain in which the
wave function
of the source is appreciable.
When the
experiment
begins, there is therefore
no interaction
be-
tween the electron and the source of potential,
so that
we can write
the
solution
of the
wave
equation
for
the combined
system
as a simple
product

(23)
We now
apply
the adiabatic
approximation, " which
is based on the large value of the M; plus the fact that
V(
.y;,x) and R(
y,—y, (t) . ) are fairly regular
and slowly
varying
functions
of the y;. Because these
conditions
are satisfied, we can neglect 58 lnR/By, , and
the
term
on
the
right-hand
side
of (21) involving
(1/Mi)8'/By/

to the term
containing

(Note that we have also replaced
i,=P,/M;= (1/M;) BS/~lx, ,
by its average,
8,(t), because the probability
of an ap-
preciable
difference
between i, and 8;(/) is negligible. )
We then make the substitution
where
Po(x,t) is the
initial
electronic
wave
function
(which also takes the form of a suitable packet).
After
the
experiment
is over
(and
the interaction
vanishes
again), the wave function
will, in general, take
the form of a sum of products
(19)
where
the P„(x,t) represents
a set of solutions
of the
wave equation for the electron alone, and P (
y;.
,])
a corresponding
set for the source variables. If such a
sum of products
is necessary,
then it is clear that it
will be impossible
to factor out a one-body
Schrodinger
equation
applying
to the electronic
variables
alone. As
we shall see, however,
because the parts of the source
are so heavy,
only a single
such product
is actually
needed.
To treat this problem,
let us erst tentatively
write
the solution as
The complete
wave
function
is obtained
by multi-
plying P' with
y(x

t) =R( I" )
XexpLiS(, y;(/)+I;, t)/5].
This is
O'=R(

) exptiS(, y,(i)+e,

X4'(x,
e;
t).
(24)
Since Eq. (22) does not contain derivatives
of e;, these
variables can be set equal to any specified set of values.
But from (24), we see that the wave function is appreci-
able, only in a small range, near 0,=0. Thus, to a good
approximation,
we can write P'(x,
.e,",t) =g (x,t),
where P(x,t) is the value
of P' when all the I, are set
equal
to zero. Equation
(24) becomes
(after
setting

12, for more details.

as Eq. (17)$.We have thus accomplished
our objective
of showing
that when the source of potential
is taken
into
account
quantum-mechanically,
we
obtain
the
same result as that given in our first paper,
where the
potential
was
assumed
to be a specified
function
of
space and time.
We can now obtain directly from the above treatment
the
same
conclusion
that
was
drawn
by Furry
and
Ramsey" in terms of an illustrative
example of a meas-
urement
process (see Sec. 2). Thus, if, in the case of the
drift tube experiment,
the interaction
with the source
were
such as to make a measurement
of which
tube
the electron actually passed through
possible, then after
this interaction
is over, the wave function
would take
the form of a sum of products,
in which the electron
wave function
is correlated to the wave function
of the
apparatus. "Such a sum would be a special case of the
expansion
given in Eq. (19).As is well known,
however,
when
the wave function
of the combined
system
takes
the
form
of a sum
of products
of the kind
described
above,
thenthere
i,s no interference
between
the diferent
parts of
the electronic
wave function
In ord.er that there shall be
such interference,
it is necessary that the wave function
of the
combined
system
take
the
form
of a simple
product
(18). But if this happens,
then by observing
the apparatus,
we will obtain
no further
information
about the electron.
Therefore,
the adiabaticity
of the
interaction,
which guarantees
that the source shall not
destroy the interference
properties
of the electron,
also
guarantees
that
no measurement
can be made
as to
which partial beam the electron actually passed through.
We shall
now illustrate
the equivalence
of the one-
body treatment
to that in which the apparatus
is treated
quantum
mechanically,
in terms of some examples. We
shall begin with our first case of a split electron beam
passing
through
a pair of drift tubes. Suppose that one
of these tubes is attached
by a wire to a generator
of
electric potential,
while the other is grounded
(at zero
potential).
We now suggest a simplified
model of such
a generator.
Consider
a sphere
of capacity
C (much
greater than that of the drift tube Co), with two small
holes in it, at opposite ends of a diameter. Ke then take
an insulating
rod of mass M, with some charge distribu-
tion fixed near its center. Let this rod move in such a
way that it passes through
the two holes in the sphere.
If we let y be the coordinate
of the center of the rod,
then the potential
on the sphere will evidently
rise from
essentially
zero to some maximum
value, as the charge
enters the sphere,
after which it will fall again to zero
when
the charge
leaves.
This potential
will therefore
have a form, U(y), which resembles
a localized packet-
like function
in y space. If the rod moves
(by its own
inertia)
with
some velocity j(t), this movement
will
produce
a potential
U(y(t)), which
is time dependent,
in such a way that. it starts at V=O at t=0, rises to a

22, for a more

theory.
maximum
of some time,
I,=t, and then falls back to
zero as t~ .
Thus, we are able to produce the kind of
time dependent
potential
required
in this experiment.
And if the adiabaticity
conditions
are satisfied,
then,
as we have shown,
the one-body
Schrodinger
equation
with this time dependent
potential
will yield the same
results
as would
the exact quantum
mechanical
treat-
ment,
based on solving
for the wave function
tp(x, y,t)
for the combined
system.
Another
example
that is interesting
to study
is af-
forded by the consideration
of a condenser,
consisting
of two large insulating
Rat sheets of mass M', charged
uniformly
and
oppositely
with
a surface
density,
0-,
which is attached without
possibility
of moving relative
to the sheets. Let y& be the coordinate of the first sheet,
yi that
of the second
(in a direction
perpendicular
to
the sheets). The energy
of interaction
with an electron.
outside the sheets is then
W= +4iroe(yi —yi),
(26)
the sign being opposite,
in accordance
with the side of
the condenser
on which the electron is.
Let us suppose that initially
the condenser
sheets are
practically
in contact, so that the above potential
energy
is essentially
zero. At this time, a pair of wave packets
corresponding
to a split electron beam is allowed to pass
on opposite
sides of the condenser.
Then,
when
the
packets have gone far enough
so that edge fields can be
neglected,
the condensers
are allowed to separate
with
some
relative
momentum,
pi—pi,
thus
generating
a
potential
difference
between
the two beams
given by
(26). After some time, the attraction
of the two sheets
for
each
other
overcomes
their
initial
relative
mo-
mentum,
and they turn around to approach
each other.
After they touch, so that S' is zero again, the electron
beams
are allowed. to pass over the edge of the con-
denser,
and are brought
together to interfere.
This example
is useful because it brings
out an im-
portant
point,
viz. , that
whereas
the electro'
exerts a
force on each sheet,
there is, nevertheless,
no net force in
the electron, because the sheets exert equal and opposite
forces on it. Thus,
while
the
e1.ectron can be seen to
change
the
relative
momentum
of the parts
of the
source, the total momentum
of the source is not altered;
and it is basically for the reason that the reaction forces
of the source on the electron cancel out. (Note that the
kinetic
energy
of the electron
is therefore
not altered;
the change of energy of the parts of the source can be
shown
to come from
cross terms
of the electrostatic
fietd of the electron
with the electrostatic retd
of the
source. )
We note also that a similar argument
can be applied
in the general
case. For example,
with the drift tubes,
we can consider
pairs of small
elements
of charge
on
opposite
diameters
of these tubes as a basic unit. To
simplify
the problem,
let us suppose that the electron
is at the center of the tube. Then it will exert equal and

i520

AN D D. BOHM
opposite forces on the elements
of the pair, so that the
net reaction of this pair on the electron vanishes.
Since
this happens for every such pair, it follows that the total
force on the electron
is zero, even though
the electron
is actually
exerting a force in every element
of charge
in the tube.
Ke thus
verify
again that
in quantum
mechanics,
there are experimental
situations
in which the behavior
of an electron can be inQuenced
by interactions,
under
conditions
in which
there is no force on it, so that ac-
cording to classical theory,
no effects could occur.

In Sec. 3, we treated the source of electric potential
quantum
mechanically,
and showed
that if the source
is heavy enough for the adiabatic approximation
to hold,
the results are the same as if the potential
is taken to be
a specified function
of space and time entering
the one-
body
Schrodinger
equation
for the electron. Ke shall
now go on to obtain a similar result for the case of mag-
netic potentials.
This case is not so straightforward
as
is the corresponding
electrical problem, because the mag-
netic vector potentials
satisfy d'Alembert's
equation,

where
we are using the gauge
in which
divA=O,
and
where j, is the divergence
free part of j (i.e., divj, =0
and VXjr=0). As a result, there is no simple
expression
corresponding
to the integral
(10) for the electric po-
tential,
which
would,
in general,
determine
the mag-
netic vector potential
at a given time in terms of the
current
distribution
at that
time. Rather,
as is well
known,
the Geld has a "dynamic"
character,
implied
by the fact that even when j(x,t) is given everywhere,
an arbitrary
solution of the homogeneous
wave equation
can be added to A. As a result,
A cannot be eliminated,
as was the case with g; and
in quantum
mechanics,
it must therefore be included
in the wave function
and
in the wave equation.
It follows then that the method
given
in Sec. 3 will
not be adequate
for the magnetic
case, and that a more
general treatment
will be needed. This treatment,
which
we shall give here, will also show how the local character
of the
interaction
between
charge
and
field,
which
played
an essential
part
in our
discussion
in Sec. 1,
appears
in the theory
when
the fields are treated
dy-
namically,
instead
of as specified functions
of position
and time.
We begin by writing
down the Hamiltonian
for the
system,
consisting
of sources, the electromagnetic
field,
and the electron under discussion. "

The wave function
of the system must depend on the
above variables,
so that it can be expressed
as

.
where A(z) is the potential
at the point.
As in Sec. 3, we can use the WEB approximation
for
the source,
so that its wave function
may be written
as g(. y;,t), where p is a narrow
packet-like
func-
tion which
is appreciable
only in a small
region
near
y=y, (t), the
classical
orbit
of the particle.
We then
make the adiabatic
approximation,
based on the large
mass,
which
we are assuming
for the source particles.
In analogy
with Eq. (20), we write
@=P( y;, t)t( y;,x,
A(z), t).

(3ob)
where (y, (t)), is the average of y; over its wave packet.
Because the position (y, (t)), and the velocity (v;(t)),
appear
in Eq. (30b) only as average
quantities,
which
are c numbers
and not operators,
it is now possible to
divide A(z, t) into two parts, one of which (A(x,t)), , is
a C number
associated
with the average
movement
of
the source,
while
the other, A'(z, t), is an operator
as-
sociated
with
the "zero point"
quantum
Quctuations
of the
electromagnetic
field,
plus
whatever
field
is
generated
by the electrons. Thus,
A(x, t) = (A(z, t)),.+A'(x, t).
(31a)
Rigorously,
the
average
potential
(A(z,t)),
should
satisfy d'Alembert's
equation, corresponding
to the aver-
age
current
density
j(z,t) = (e/c)P, 8(z—x,')(v, (t)), .
However, because the acceleration of the source particles
is negligible
in typical
cases (e.g., the electrons
in a
solenoid)
and because
the velocities
a,re small
enough
for relativistic e6ects to be neglected,
we can replace the
exact solution
of d'Alembert's
equation
by
(A(z,t))-=- Z(v (t))'-/I z—yi(t)
I
(31b)
This is, of course, just the expression
leading
to the
Riot-Savart
law.
We have thus separated
out a part (A(x,t)),
of the
total vector potential,
A(z, t), which
is related
to the
current
distribution,
in the same way that the electro-
static potential
is related to the charge distribution
by
the integral
(10). Note,
however,
that
there
remains
another
part of the potential,
A'(x, t), so that we have
not expressed
the total potential
as a function
of the
current
density at the same moment
of time (i.e., we
have not eliminated
the dynamic
character
of A).
When the transformation
implied by the substitution
(31a) and
(31b) is used
in the
wave
function,
then
(v; (t)),
A(y;), which is permissible
if M; is large enough.
(To do this is equivalent
to assuming
that the effects
of mutual
induction
between the source particles can be
neglected
in comparison
to those of their own inertia.
This simplification
evidently
does not change the results
in any essential
way. )
As in Sec. 3, we can set u, =0 in Eq. (30a), because
derivatives
of u; do not appear
in this equation,
and
because P (
.y,",t) is negligible
for appreciable
values
of I;. We shall write
('(

(32)
In
the
above
equation,
the
term
A'(x, t)
(which
couples the electron to the part of the electromagnetic
field that is not generated
by the source) describes,
as
we pointed out above, the effects of zero point "vacuum"
fluctuations
of the field,
along
with
associated
effects
(such as the back reaction
of the electron's
own field
on itself),
which
are taken
into account
in standard
renormalization
theory. "However, it is well known that
in the first approximation,
the sects of the zero-point
fluctuations
on the electron average
out to zero, while
in the second approximation
they introduce
corrections
which
(along with those of the self-field of the electron)
are quite small. We shall neglect these corrections here.
This is evidently
equivalent
to leaving
out the term
A'(x) in Eq. (31).The Hamiltonian
H~' then ceases to
be coupled to the electron variables. The wave function
can therefore be chosen as a simple product

where
Xp(

the ground
state of

therefore
the
"zero-point"
fluctuations)
while f(x,t) satisfies the equation

Res
We have thus achieved
our aim of showing
that the
quantum
mechanical
treatment
of the magnetic
source
leads to the same results as those of the one-body treat-
ment,
in which
the vector potential
is taken to be a
specified function
of space and time.
The fundamental
role of potentials
can now be il-
lustrated
in more
detail
by considering
the following
simple
example,
in which a solenoid
surrounded
by an
impenetrable
potential
barrier is switched
on adiabatic-
ally.
Suppose
that,
as suggested
in our discussion
in
Sec. 2, the electron originates
in a Faraday cage, so that
it is not acted on by the electric field resulting
from
turning
on the solenoid.
(This electric field is cancelled
by the eAects of currents induced in the wall of the cage,
currents which can, however, be treated in the formalism
as just another part of the source variables. ) The average
initial
momentum
and
position
of the
electron
wave
packet are then so arranged
that after this electric 6eld
vanishes,
the electron
emerges
through
a hole in the
cage. (The hole is so small that the penetration
of the
electric field through
it can be neglected. ) The packet

is then
split into two parts by
a, bi-prism,
which
go
around
the solenoid
on opposite sides, after which they
are reunited
by another bi-prism,
into a single coherent
packet. This packet then enters a second Faraday cage,
through a small hole, after which the Qux in the solenoid
is turned
off adiabatically.
Interference
phenomena
are
then observed
inside the second Faraday cage.
The
above
experiment
satisfies
the
conditions
as-
sumed
in our treatments
in Secs. 3 and 4; viz. , that
initially
there
is no interaction
between
electron
and
source, while during
the course of the experiment,
this
interaction
rises to its full value and then falls back to
zero. Moreover, it is evident that at no stage is the elec-
tron wave packet in a region containing
electromagnetic
fields Li.e., E(x) and $C(x)).
It is clear that there is no way to formulate
this prob-
lem in the quantum
theory without
considering
poten-
tials. Thus, when the initial quantum
state of the elec-
tron at t=0 is determined
as represented
by a certain
packet wave function,
this packet by itself contains
no
reAection
whatsoever
of the fact that
there
is a Aux
in the solenoid
(since the electron
was screened
from
electric fields by a Faraday cage). Indeed, we must start
with the initial wave function
for the combined
system
of the form (33), where f is taken to be the initial elec-
tron wave packet Po(x) and P the initial packet of the
set of particles
&0(
y,",t) in the source,
whlie the
electromagnetic
field
is represented
by Xo(A'(a, t)) de-
scribing
the
zero-point
"vacuum"
fiuctuations
in the
field. By solving Schrodinger
s equation
for this system,
we see from the changing
form of 0 how the quantum
fluctuations
take
place
around
a
changing
average
(A(x,t)),„representing
the effects of the source. The
electron responds
mainly,
as we have seen, however,
to
the average
(A(x,t)), , while the quantum
fluctuations
have
effects which
can, to a good approximation,
be
neglected.
As a result,
the operator
A(x, t) can be re-
placed by the c number,
(A(x,t)), ; and this is how we
came back to the one-body
Schrodinger
equation
with
specified potentials.
We see then that whether
we treat the potentials
as
specified functions
of space and time (as we did in Secs. 1
and
2), or as dynamical
variables
furnishing
a link
between
the source and the electron
(as we did in this
section),
there
is no way
in the quantum
theory
to
express
the effect of a Qux inside
the solenoid
on an
electron
outside
in
terms
of a localized
interaction,
except with the aid of potentials.
In no case does the
theory ever contain any kind of interaction
between the
electron and the source, which does not go through
the
intermediary
of potentials
and, as we have seen, fields
are not, in general,
adequate
for expressing
all aspects
of this intermediary
role.

APPENDIX
Some Comments
on a Payer
by Peshkin,
Talmi,
and Tassie, Concerning
the Role of Potentials
in the Quantum
Theory
Recently
there
has
appeared
a paper
by Peshkin,
Talmi,
and Tassie," on the role of potentials
in the
quantum
theory. " This paper
seems to have
two ob-
jectives;
firstly,
to show that
the nonclassical
conse-
quences of potentials
in the quantum
theory should not
be regarded
as surprising,
and
secondly,
to suggest
that these consequences
should
not be ascribed to the
potentials,
but rather to the effects of suitable
fields on
the quantum
conditions
applying
to the electron. With
the erst of these objectives,
we are, of course, in agree-
ment,
as we indicated
in Sec. 1. We do not, however,
regard the second objective as a valid one; and we shall
show
here
the
inadequacy
of such
an
approach,
in
terms of several of the points that were treated
in the
above article.
The first
question
considered
by these
authors
is
concerned
with the problem
of stationary
states of an
electron in a multiply-connected
region of space, which
contains
Aux in the excluded
region. They begin
with
an analysis,
which leads them to the same conclusions
that
we gave
with
regard
to this problem
in Sec. 2;
viz. , that the allowed values of the energy of the electron
are related to this Aux in a way that is independent
of
the past history
of the electron
(e.g., of whether
the
electron
was in the orbit in question
or not while the
flux was being turned on). However,
in stating this con-
dition,
they assert that "The presence
of the field in
the excluded
region
permanently
changes
the allowed
values
of the
physical
angular
momentum
of every
electron in the world; regardless
of how the system
was
actually
prepared.
Such
arguments
from
the
cor-
respondence
principle,
which
are now very old, apply
equally
to the Zeeman
effect." In their Abstract
they
also state that the observable
effects of potentials
arise,
not from forces exerted by magnetic
6elds or by their
vector potential, but from modifications
of the quantum
conditions.
In view of the above statements,
it seems
dificult to avoid the condlusion
that these authors
wish
to imply that somehow the role of the potentials
can be
eliminated,
because the fields in the excluded regions are
able to account for the change
in the quantum
condi-
tions and presumably,
in a similar
way, for all possible
physical
properties
of the electron.
In accordance
with
the discussion
of this problem
given in our paper,
however,
we see that the fields in
the excluded
region cannot
be regarded
as interacting
directly
with the electron. Indeed, this interaction
goes
by the intermediary
of the potentials;
and it is only
when this is taken into account that the essential feature
of the
locality
of interaction
of electromagnetic
field
~ We wish to thank the above authors for sending
us a @reprint
of their work.

with electron can be brought
properly
into the theory.
And since the above applies
to the exact form of the
quantum
theory, it must also apply in the correspond-
ence limit of high quantum
numbers
(which is, after all,
an approximation
to the exact theory),
so that
this
conclusion
cannot be altered
by an appeal to the cor-
respondence
principle. It is therefore
not sufficient
to
attribute
the change of quantum
state of the electron
to the field in the excluded region, but in a more nearly
complete
treatment,
one must take into account
how
this change is brought
about by means of the influence
of the potentials
which
link the quantum
state of the
electron to the current in the source by means
of purely
local interactions.
The next problem
considered
by Peshkin, Talmi, and
Tassie,
was that
of the
origin
of the
average
force
(i.e., the average rate of momentum
transfer)
in the scat-
tering
of an electron
beam
oG a solenoid
of negligible
radius. In their discussion of this problem, they indicated
without,
however,
giving
a proof
that
(a) when
no
barrier
is present,
this force can be accounted
for as a
result of the possibility
that the electron
will penetrate
into the magnetic
Geld region; and (b) when there is a
barrier, the force comes from interaction
of the electron
with the barrier
in question.
Before proceeding
further,
it is worthwhile
here to
show
that
these
conclusions
can be proved
directly
from Ehrenfest's
theorem
fEq. (5)7. Thus,
if there
is
no barrier
V=O, and the average force is equal in this
case to
(e/c) j'iP*(vX K)gdx
(since 8=0 also). The
above
is, of course, just the average
magnetic
force.
If there is a barrier,
then to simplify
the problem,
let
us suppose
that it is very
high,
but not infinite.
(In
this way, we will guarantee
that the wave function and
its derivatives
are finite everywhere,
so that the condi-
tions necessary
for the validity
of Ehrenfest's
theorem
are satisfied. ) Then, as is well known,
the electron
will
penetrate
with
appreciable
probability
only
a short
distance
into the barrier,
so that
the wave
function,
iP(x) will be essentially
zero near the origin,
where the
magnetic
fi.eld is not zero. As a result,
the
average
magnetic
force vanishes,
and the average
force will be
J'P(VV)iPdx,
which is just the force coming
from the
barrier, as was indeed suggested
in the above paper.
Peshkin,
Talmi, and Tassie then assert that because
the force comes from the barrier in the manner described
above, there
is no reason to ascribe
any force to the
excluded magnetic
Geld or to the local vector potential.
They recognize, however, that the average force exerted
by a given
barrier
depends
on the
Aux
inside.
For
example,
in the absence
of Aux, such a barrier
has a
cross section and a proportional
average
force of the
order of the radius,
while when there is Qux within,
the
cross section for the same barrier can rise to a generally
much
larger
value,
of the order
of the wavelength
of
the incident
electrons. They ascribe this change
in the
effectiveness
of a given barrier to the
modification
of
the quantum
conditions"
(which
they
have,
in turn,
ascribed to the eRects of the magnetic
6eld inside the
barrier).
From
these
statements,
it would
seem
once
again
that
the
above
authors
are
giving
arguments
against
the
notion
that
in
quantum
mechanics
the
potentials
play a role more significant
than that which
they played
classically.
In answer to these arguments,
we first point out that
from
the
modification
of quantum
conditions
alone,
there is, in general,
no way to calculate either the scat-
tering cross section or the average force on the electron,
without
first specifying the vector potential
in the whole
region outside the barrier, and then solving Schrodinger's
equa, tion in detail. (For example, in the case of a ba,rrier
of a radius
that
is appreciable
in comparison
to the
wavelength
of the incident
electrons,
all physical
ef-
fects will depend
on this detailed
solution. ) It is only
by thus introducing
the potentials
that we can account
for the change of the average force exerted by the same
barrier,
when no fields of any kind change except those
in the region that is not accessible to the electron.
The above discussion
illustrates
once again that
(as
we have
emphasized
throughout
this article), the con-
cept of force is, in the quantum
theory,
an abstraction
of secondary
importance.
Therefore, from the fact that
potentials
exert no forces, it does not follow that
(as
seems to be implied
by the above
authors)
these po-
tentials
can have no physically
significant
eGects.
Finally,
Peshkin,
Talmi, and Tassie give a model for
the interaction
of the electron
with the source of the
fieM. To do this,
they
assume
a direct
velocity-de-
pendent
mechanical
interaction
between
the electron
and the source, which gives rise essentially
to the Biot-
Savart law for the electron. On the basis of this model,
they are led to a result analogous to that which we give
in Sec. 4; viz. , that the interference
eGects are the same
as those obtained
on the basis of the one-body
Schrod-
inger
equation
with
the potentials
given
as specified
functions
of the time.
In connection
with the above model,
there are two
points that we wish to stress. First, this model involves
the
assumption
of a nonlocal
mechanical
interaction
between
electron and source, which is adequate
for the
purpose of proving the result described above, but which
cannot be used for a treatment
of the problem
of the
locality of the interaction,
which we have stressed in our
article. Secondly,
this model has been used
(within its
proper
domain
of validity)
to make certain
inferences,
which are, however,
misleading
for other reasons. These
inferences
were based
on the fact that
what
appears
in the Hamiltonian
obtained
by the above authors
is
not the vector potential,
but rather,
the momentum,
Pa, canonically
conjugate to the source variable.
From
the
constancy
of ps with
time
(which
follows
from
their Hamiltonian),
it can be seen that quantum
fluctua-
tions of the magnetic field in the source have no inQuence
on the interference
phenomena
under
discussion.
And
since the vector
potential
fluctuates
along
with
this
magnetic
field, it would
seem at first sight that
in a

situation
in which quantum
Quctuations
are important,
the interference
eGects are determined,
not by the po-
tentials,
but rather
by some other
variables
(in this
case, ps). Thus,
one might
be led to conclude
that in
such
cases,
the
potentials
are
not
of fundamental
significance
in the theory.
A more careful
analysis
shows,
however,
that
while
the calculation
of Peshkin,
Talmi, and Tassie sho~ving
the dependence
of interference
eGects on the constant
of the motion
p~ is correct, their
discussion
does not
make clear that the vector potential
plays an essential
part in bringing
about this result. For as can be shown
quite
readily,
this
dependence
of interference
effects
on.
pp
(with
their
resulting
independence
from
the
quantum
fluctuations
of the field in the source) is due
to a compeesat~on
of the effects of the fluctuating
part
of the vector potential
by the eGects of the electric
fields, 8=—(1/c)(BA/83), that inevitably
accompanies
such a change of vector potential.
(In Sec. 1 we treated
a similar
problem, " where
we saw that stray 60-cycle
magnetic
fields
compensated
the
eGects
of the
cor-
responding
fluctuating
potentials
to produce a constant
and stable interference
pattern. )
In order to seen in more detail what is happening
in
this problem,
we first note that there is a back reaction
of the magnetic
field of the (moving)
incident
electron
on the source (see, for example, the latter part of Sec. 3,
where a similar reaction
was found
in the electrostatic
case). This
(in general,
changing)
magnetic
6eld in-
duces
an electromotive
force in the
source
solenoid;
and as a result there is mutual
interaction
of the elec-
tronic variables
and the source variable,
in which
the
states
of both
are
altered.
Nevertheless,
as
can be
shown
by a simple
calculation,
this interaction
is such
that it leads to the constancy
of pti.
In all discussions
given until now, the source has been
assumed
to be so heavy
that
for practical
purposes,
"See reference 3.
the eGects of the electronic magnetic
Q.eld on the source
current
can be neglected
(as indeed
also follows
in the
treatment
of the above authors, if the mass of the source
is allowed to become very large). If, however,
the mass
is not large, then one will have to take into account the
eGects of the
changing
Qux produced
by the source,
which will, as pointed out in the above discussion,
give
rise to a further
electric Geld. It is clear, oI course, that
when
such an electric field is present,
interference
ef-
fects will no longer, in general, be given by the formulae
of our first paper, in which we, by hypothesis,
restricted
ourselves to the case in which there were eo fietds of aey
kited
in the region
accessible to the electron. In fact
when
fields are present,
the interference
properties
of
the electron
are as pointed
out in Sec. 1, determined
(in the
limit
of high
quantum
numbers)
by gp dx
=+Lmv+(|,/c)A'j
dx,
where
y is its
canonical
mo-
mentum,
and
mv its "physical"
momentum
Lsee Eq.
(4)$. However,
as
a, result
of the
change
of source
strength
brough
about
by the magnetic
GeM of the
electron,
the vector potential,
A(x), that
is actually
present
on the path
of the
electron
will
be slightly
diGerent
from what it would have been, if this reaction
had not occurred. Thus, it will no longer be correct to
calculate
the integral,
gA dx, under
the assumption
that no such a reaction takes place. On the other hand,
the resulting
electric field acting
on the electron
will
change the "physical" momentum,
and as can be veri-
Ged by a simple calculation,
this alteration just compen-
sates the effects of the change in A on the interference
pattern.
This
result
shows
that
the
implication
of
Peshkin,
Talmi,
and
Tassie,
that
potentials
are not
playing
a fundamental
role
here,
is wrong.
For the
fiuctuating
part of the potentials
is just what is needed
to explain
the dependence
of the interference
pattern
on the constant
of the motion,
pp, despite the presence
of the fluctuating
electric held,
which
necessarily
ac-
companies
this fluctuating
potential.
