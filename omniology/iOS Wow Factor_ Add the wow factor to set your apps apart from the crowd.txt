It would be a tough task to call out everyone who influenced the thinking 
expressed here in this book. There’s been an endless stream of collabora-
tors, colleagues, instigators, and sounding boards that have helped me un-
derstand my own perspective on user experience design. However, for 
their early insight and influence in my more formative years I would like to 
thank Wayne Neale, Chris Koch, Corey Bernardo, and Mike Telek.  
I would also like to thank Lucas Jordan for helping make this book possible. 
Special thanks goes to Lynne Mikel for her unwavering support while this

Introduction 
It’s a tough market out there, and as I’m sure you know, it can be very diffi-
cult for your application to get noticed in the App Store.  There are literally 
hundreds of thousands of both interesting and not so interesting applica-
tions available for download now. Just having a highly functional and stable 
application from a development perspective isn’t enough to get your app the 
recognition it needs to go mainstream. Users expect to be ‘Wowed’ with 
their iOS apps, this is probably something that you have experienced your-
self. As you probably know, it’s the ‘Wow Factor’ of that initial app expe-
rience that sets the hook and gets users engaged with the features and func-
tions that you or your development team have been working so hard to 
create. It’s ‘Wow Factor’ that gets you world of mouth recommendations 
between friends and great reviews in the app store. It’s ‘Wow Factor’ that 
can drive the viral adoption of the application that ends up funding your ear-
ly retirement!  The big question is, what is Wow Factor, and how do you 
get it?  
Those are not easy questions to answer, but the good news is that there 
are answers, and I certainly will address those later in this book -  but you 
need to know that you can get to ‘Wow’ if you are willing to start paying 
close attention to the details of your application experience. There’s no 
doubt about it, critical thinking, excellent problem solving skills, and solid 
design methods are behind any great user experience. Elevating your design 
practice to a higher level is absolutely necessary to get that ‘Wow’ that you 
are looking for, and that’s at the heart of what this book is about. But 
‘Wow’ takes more than good design practice. It’s also rooted in how you 
think about, or frame up your design problems and that requires a greater 
understanding of the wider context for the design decisions you are going 
to make.  
It’s my firm belief that you can’t truly know where you are going without a 
good understanding of where you have been. The iPhone isn’t the first

smartphone to appear in the market, although it is one of the most success-
ful and influential. As an application designer, or developer, you understand 
at some level the huge opportunity this new platform presents and obvious-
ly you’d like to take advantage of it. By looking into the past we can under-
stand why the iPhone is the way it is and why it is held up as a shining bea-
con of great user experience.  
As you think about your application, you may need to build upon some of 
the fundamental concepts behind that experience the core experience of 
iOS, but on the other hand, you may just want to toss them aside. The idea 
behind this book is fairly simple, to give you, designer and developer, prac-
tical insights into the nature of the iOS user experience, while empowering 
you with information to create your own exceptional applications. For many 
people, Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines is the starting point for under-
standing the possibilities that iOS enables for users. But what do you do if 
you need to go beyond those rudimentary guidelines? Because they are just 
that, rudimentary - and that’s just not going to cut it for you!  This book 
intends to help push you beyond the basic assumptions you may have about 
iOS applications provide you with the ideas and techniques that will help 
you build upon your own insights and free your personal creativity. 
Creating a successful iOS application isn’t easy, but it’s my hope that this 
book will help you take your application to the next level and help it get the 
attention that it deserves.

Putting the iOS 
Human Interface 
Guidelines in  
Context 
 
Apple’s iOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) aim to be the definitive start-
ing point for designers and developers new to the platform. The company’s 
approach to the guide is simple—provide a critical mass of information, 
techniques, and basic methods to get an individual or development team 
building applications as quickly as possible.  
The guidelines set out to make the reader aware of the radically new interac-
tion model that the platform presents. The initial challenge for Apple, when 
the device was opened up for third-party application development, was to get 
the platform adopted as a viable vehicle for the distribution and deployment 
of applications.  
At the time of Apple’s App Store launch in the summer of 2008, there was a 
well-established community of specialized teams focused on mobile devices 
and consumer electronics that were well-positioned to migrate to this plat-

form and to begin creating software for it. However, the skills and expertise 
required for success were still considered a relatively niche domain. Apple 
needed a much broader base of development teams populating the App Store 
with great software in order for their strategy to succeed. 
Looking Back 
Before 2008, mobile applications were a somewhat primitive affair—at least 
by today’s standards. This was not due to any lack of trying on the part of 
developers; it was because of the technological limitations imposed by de-
vices. “Feature phones” of the era were known for their portability, with 
small size being among the top criteria for success. Subsequently, these de-
vices had very small displays with both low bit-depth color support and low 
resolution for their scale. Processor capability and memory availability were 
other significant constraints. This meant that the design of a mobile applica-
tion was an exercise in minimalism and restraint. In that environment, the 
expectations for what a mobile application could be, how it would work, and 
what it looked like were not very high. Market fragmentation presented its 
own set of challenges as well, driving designers and developers to target a 
lowest common denominator of input and display to ensure success across a 
large variety of devices. This approach contributed significantly to a subop-
timal user experience for applications running on those devices. 
“Smartphones” presented a different set of challenges. They usually had 
larger, higher-quality screens and much greater computational capacity. 
However, these devices often had unique input characteristics that varied 
significantly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Some of the more prevalent 
forms of input included 
 Jog dials 
 Four- and five-way controllers 
 Dedicated buttons or hard keys
 Variable buttons or soft keys
 Stylus input
 Touch input
A given device incorporated any combination of these controls as a part of its 
design. In many cases the nature of the input was considered a “signature in-

3  
teraction” from which a device’s particular brand could be identified. Much 
of this was due to the fact that most early smartphones were a direct evolu-
tion from the popular PDAs (personal digital assistants) that preceded them. 
So naturally, these new types of phones inherited those interaction characte-
ristics in order to leverage the value and recognition of the signature interac-
tion.  
With the maturation of the feature phone and smartphone markets, there was 
a high degree of specialization and focus surrounding the design and devel-
opment of software for those devices. Fragmentation of the smartphone mar-
ket and the idiosyncrasies of each platform pushed that knowledge into in-
creasingly esoteric enclaves of design practice.  
Apple’s iPhone challenged those expectations. Previously held beliefs about 
what a mobile phone was, what it could do, and how it could operate needed 
to change radically, so individuals with previous domain expertise needed to 
be prompted to change their mindsets. 
We take devices like the iPad and iPhone for granted now, but we have to 
remember that when the iPhone was originally released there was some con-
troversy about the Home button and the phone’s general form factor. The 
simplicity of the device, its large screen (at the time), and lack of dedicated 
hard controls were in stark contrast to virtually all other smartphones of the 
day. People immediately questioned the functionality and usability of the 
Home button. Some even thought that the success of the product hinged on 
that single control. The migration of many controls from dedicated hard but-
tons to pixels displayed on the touch screen were also a significant point of 
contention. 
It’s through that lens that we begin to understand the nature of the HIG. We 
can see that history reflected in two main themes that emerge when review-
ing the documentation: 
 Understanding the platform implications, particularly 
around input and control, including the passive sensing ca-
pabilities 
 Awareness and sensitivity to well-executed user expe-
rience in the context of the platform’s technical capabili-
ties and physical attributes  
Essentially, this is the purpose of the “Platform Characteristics” section of 
the HIG, which makes a number of points intended to ease teams into under-

Chapter 1 | Putting the iOS Human Interface Guidelines in Context 
 
4  
standing how different this platform is from what they may have worked on 
in the past. 
This was necessary because without eliminating the preconceived notions of 
the industry at that time, it would not have been possible to achieve the level 
of execution the device required. This was a sensible approach for Apple, as 
it reinforced the strategy of establishing the device as a mainstream platform 
with mass-market appeal. 
Limitations 
However, the HIG has its drawbacks and limitations. While Apple is careful 
to delineate Human Interface Principles and User Experience Guidelines, 
both of these areas are somewhat limited in scope. Interaction designers may 
not find much value in these sections owing to the concrete nature of the 
statements made there; the lack of abstraction or underlying rationale behind 
the recommendations provides little on which interaction designers can build. 
The design content of the document is thus too general, lacking the depth to 
empower sophisticated user experience design activities. 
The HIG also makes some perfunctory statements about process that are 
clearly targeted toward less-experienced teams, and while the process state-
ments are valid for certain scenarios, they don’t provide a clear understand-
ing of a comprehensive design methodology that can be adapted to many 
needs and situations. 
The limitations are not necessarily problematic for a first attempt at creating 
a good or even great iOS application, given the nature of the target audience. 
The fact that Apple has prioritized display size, display orientation, and the 
dynamics of capacitive touch screen interface input tells us that they are in-
tent on democratizing mobile application (and mobile web) expertise by hav-
ing design and development teams focus on input and output as the most im-
portant factors for understanding a user interface solution. 
We can’t expect Apple to provide an all-inclusive resource for creating great 
software. The HIG is an excellent starting point, but if we take a step back 
we can see that it is really about addressing the risks of opening up the device 
to third-party developers—protecting Apple’s brand image and perception of 
iOS devices within the market to ensure their continuing success. Apple is 
completely justified in having ulterior motives since the success of any given 
third-party application becomes a success for their organization. By outward 

iOS Wow Factor 
 
5  
appearances it seems that Apple is trying to democratize good design, but the 
HIG also aims to preserve and perpetuate the brand through the following 
strategy:  
 Creating a sense of exclusivity and cultural cachet for con-
sumers 
 Maintaining the aspirational aura associated with iOS de-
vices and the brand itself 
 Justifying premium pricing within a market known for its 
razor-thin margins 
 Of course, this should not be a surprise to anyone, but we 
should recognize that these are some of the fundamental 
driving factors of the iOS Human Interface Guidelines. 
Beyond the HIG 
Successful mobile applications require more than a basic understanding of 
user experience and design-related issues. Now that a few generations of iOS 
applications have cycled through the market, it is important to define and 
document concrete information related to the development of compelling de-
vice interaction and how that can work to establish the right level of competi-
tive differentiation for a particular software product. And beyond the basic 
“Aesthetic Integrity” outlined by the HIG, how can creating impactful visual 
experiences contribute to the compelling device interaction and the differen-
tiation you may be striving for? These are issues that are not fully ad-
dressed—at least not at a level that is easy to understand. 
This book intends to dive a bit deeper into the mechanics of iOS to help you 
understand the methods and techniques that can be employed to move 
beyond a basic application. I will bypass any argument for or against custom 
controls and show you the tools and tactics required to design an amazing 
application from scratch, or undertake the wholesale reinvention of an exist-
ing application. 
The topics covered in depth later in this book are more concerned with the 
mechanics of compelling interaction that will ultimately make people love 
your software. Classic or more typical usability themes will be approached 
from this perspective as well. However, you should understand that while 
classic usability concepts are fundamental to successful software, in some 

Chapter 1 | Putting the iOS Human Interface Guidelines in Context 
 
6  
cases it may be necessary to set different priorities when designing for “de-
sire.” The impact of those types of design choices will be reviewed in an ef-
fort to give you an understanding of what’s in the balance when trying to 
make the right decision. 
You should already have some familiarity with the HIG as well as some ex-
perience designing, specifying, or building apps for either the iPhone or the 
iPad. A working knowledge of user experience design practice, or at least 
some degree of exposure to that type of thinking is assumed as well. Howev-
er, if that’s not the case, you still will find value in this book and have at your 
disposal the means to develop the concepts that will elevate your iOS app 
and engender a sense of Wow! with your users.

 Tap: This is the most basic selection behavior in the OS.
 Drag: During a persistent touch event, an object tracks 
with your finger until you remove your finger from the 
screen.
 Flick: Very similar to the drag gesture, but done with 
greater speed. The key to this gesture is really the beha-
vior inherent to the object itself. On release, “flickable” 
objects tend to display and model inertial characteristics 
that make the flick action relevant.
 Swipe: A linear brush with a finger, no direct manipula-
tion implied, often used to reveal a hidden control.
 Double Tap: Two taps in short succession to designate 
the point of origin for image or content scaling—often a 
predetermined scale factor.
 Open Pinch: User defined up-scaling determined by how 
much you “open” your pinch.
 Close Pinch: User defined down-scaling determined by 
how much you “close” your pinch.
 Long Touch: Usually associated with invoking some form 
of secondary control, as with editable text to invoke the 
magnified view, but many other uses are possible.

 From the home screen and its subsequent pages: 
By far the most likely point from which a user may launch 
an application, the visual transition associated with this 
event portrays an app emerging from behind the icon ar-
ray and pushing those objects away. The illusion is that the 
app is moving into the same plane that the icons had pre-
viously populated.
 From the Spotlight interface: I expect that this is like-
ly the least used entry point of the three for the typical 
iOS user. In this case the Spotlight interface recedes to a 
point in space first, quickly followed by the selected app 
moving forward in space from the same vanishing point.

Chapter 2 | Deconstructing the iOS User Experience 
 
24  
 From the App Switcher: App switching has its own 
unique behavior. Once an app is selected in the switcher, 
the entire active view (including the switcher) rotates out 
of view on the z axis, quickly followed by the desired app. 
All rotation appears to share the same anchor point when 
apps exit and enter the screen. There are few connota-
tions of this unique visual behavior: first, it supports the 
idea of switching (as in toggling between two states), and 
second, the idea of multitasking, since the exiting app 
seems to be rotating just out of view—and not vanishing 
into oblivion.

 Finite Navigation: Providing users with redundant 
means of navigation, or enhanced nonlinear navigation, is 
unnecessary at best, and at worst can be confusing or dis-
tracting. The ease of interaction with the device allows 
you to focus on creating a single clear path through your 
content or functionality. 
 Constrained Control Mapping: It’s more effective to 
identify and isolate the limited regions of your application 
to contain user interface elements. The controls them-
selves (buttons, etc.) should be perceived as secondary 
elements, especially in situations when application content 
needs to have the most prominence.
 Constrained Control Quantity: Limit or reduce the 
number of controls that you present to the user at any 
given point in time. To manage complex applications, dis-
tribute functions across screens and seek to group like 
tasks together.

Chapter 2 | Deconstructing the iOS User Experience 
 
26  
 Control Clarity: Limit the number of unique control 
types when possible to avoid confusing the user. This ap-
plies not only to control type, but also to control render-
ing. Control functions should be identifiable by short labels 
and/or easily understood icons.
 OS Offloading: In certain situations, functionality can be 
removed from an application and managed at the OS level. 
Application settings can migrate to the iOS settings 
screen, helping reduce potential UI complexity.
 User Interface Suppression: Control elements do not 
necessarily need to be omnipresent. A simple gesture or 
touch event can invoke a control set as it is needed in the 
interface. The key is to provide the user with a mechanism 
that suggests the temporal nature of these controls and 
how to re-invoke them once they leave the screen.
 Progressive Disclosure: Strive to provide functionality 
only where and when it is needed within the flow of an 
application. It’s very likely that not every feature needs to 
be universally available, so use that to your advantage to 
reduce the complexity of your screens.
 Brand and Identity De-emphasis: It’s not necessary to 
hit users over the head over and over again with your 
brand. Identify the key points in your application where a 
significant brand and identity statement makes the most 
sense, and tone it down to an acceptable volume every-
where else.
 State Persistence and Restoration: Expect users to 
frequently engage with your application, but know that 
that engagement will be fractured. Mobile users are chron-
ically multitasking, and may open and close your applica-
tion many times while moving through your workflow to 
complete a task. Thus, you need to ensure that the state 
of your app is maintained as users leave it, and that the 
task can easily be resumed when the app is restarted.

iOS Wow Factor 
 
27  
 Implicit Saving: As with the issue of state persistence, 
any content creation tasks must be preserved and the no-
tion of “saved” should be implicit to any workflow. 
 Gestural Restraint: Limit the number of unique ges-
tures required to interact with your application. Under-
standing gesture usage or having to learn new gestures can 
be a significant barrier to the adoption of your application.
 Hierarchical Restraint: Restraint of hierarchical depth 
is really an aspect of the successful implementation of fi-
nite navigation. A high degree of hierarchical structure 
makes it difficult to design a simple and easily understood 
path through an application. That doesn’t mean that it is 
impossible, it just means that you will be challenged with 
managing user orientation or challenged with trying to 
eliminate the tedium of moving through that hierarchy.
 App Modality: A user can really only view and interact 
with one application at time. The App Switcher suggests 
that there may be multiple apps running concurrently, but 
even in that case a user is required to toggle between apps 
to do anything. At this point there is no such thing as si-
multaneous app viewing, but that may be a possibility in 
the future with larger format devices like the iPod.

 Identify your feature superset: The application you 
may be translating may be functionally robust in its current 
state. Identify and list all the possible features. 
 Group and cluster: Review your feature list and group 
or cluster like or related features together. You can also 
do this with a particular use-case or workflow in mind; 
just label and organize as needed. 
 Review and analyze: Take a look at how your feature 
groupings are starting to resolve and look at if they are 
applicable to the mobile context at a high level, and if they 
may speak to specific use-case at a more detailed level.  
 Filter: Remove or isolate features that are not relevant, 
based on the what you have identified as the primary use-
cases from your user experience strategy and by what is 
appropriate or possible for the platform. 
 Identify areas of critical mass: It may make sense to 
translate an application as a unified experience into a mo-
bile app, but you should be looking at your grouped fea-
tures to determine whether or not they can stand alone 
as applications unto themselves, and if it makes sense to 
fragment your application into multi-sub applications.

 Immediacy of impact: A design must be able to elicit an 
immediate response from the user.
 Recognition of novelty or identifiable difference: A 
user must be able to recognize the novelty of a given de-
sign, or at least identify it as being different from a more 
conventional experience.
 Positive response: There must be an inherent appeal to 
the solution that mitigates the shock of a potentially 
strange or foreign experience.

 Appearance: This describes the cosmetic attributes of a 
given design solution as expressed through the screen 
structure, layout, rendering, and other elements compris-
ing the static-state visuals of an app.
 Interaction mechanics and behavior: This refers to 
the physical interaction, unique gestures, and general input 
required to engage with the user interface elements of an 
application.
 Visual interaction, motion, and animation: These 
refer to the reactive or dynamic elements of a design solu-
tion that bring it to life. These may be closely associated 
with a particular interaction through feedback or reactivity 
to user input, but this also accounts for ambient qualities 
within a design, or even transitory states not directly re-
lated to an interaction.

 Interaction: I view this as the unit level of interactivity, 
such as the click of a button or a swipe across the screen. 
It’s essentially the action taken for input by the user as 
prompted by the system.

Chapter 6 | Interaction Modeling and the Creation of Novel Concepts 
 
88  
 Behavior: This is second order of complexity arising 
from the input of the user and the resulting feedback of 
the system. It is the perceived gestalt effect of interaction 
as demonstrated by the system.
 Pattern: I defined this as the cumulative effect of com-
pound behaviors working in a predicable and well-
organized manner.

Control Mapping 
and Touchscreen 
Ergonomics 
 
Touchscreens are certainly much more commonplace than they were a few 
years ago, but even with their mainstream adoption there is still a lack of un-
derstanding as to how to properly account for the physical interaction with 
these devices. There are many apps out there that have very cool features, but 
which are so poorly designed from an ergonomic perspective that it astounds 
me. These apps might seem intriguing enough to download, but are so awk-
ward and uncomfortable to use that they will quickly be deleted off the user’s 
device. Don’t let that happen to you! It’s worth spending some time review-
ing a few basic considerations to keep in mind when designing for an iPhone 
or iPad. If you take the time to understand the ideas outlined in this chapter, 
you’ll have a solid foundation for making the right design decisions moving 
forward. 
Awareness of Physicality 
Much that has been reviewed in this book so far has been concerned with 
creating breakthrough ideas and concepts, but this chapter diverges from

those concerns to address some basic principles that will help ensure the suc-
cess of your application. 
Many of you may be designing for the mobile space for the first time, but are 
otherwise fairly experienced in application design in other environments. 
Apart from a comprehensive understanding of input and output constraints, 
designing for mobile devices means that you have to be aware of the physi-
cality and kinesiology associated with the manipulation of these devices. If 
you have designed or developed for the Web, or designed client-side applica-
tions, I would imagine that you never gave a thought to how a user’s physical 
interaction with the input devices would affect your design. This is because 
the interaction with desktop systems is largely taken for granted. The basic 
format of keyboard, display, and mouse hasn’t changed much at all in the 
past 30 years. Those are essentially fixed hardware inputs that you have had 
little or no control over, so there was certainly no need to account for the er-
gonomics of the mouse while worrying about the workflow of your applica-
tion. 
Transitioning to mobile devices requires you to expand your design thinking 
beyond traditional boundaries. Instead of using fixed hardware inputs to con-
trol an application, we now have a situation where we can manifest controls 
in virtual environment with a high degree of flexibility. The basic input is 
touch, but that touch can be directed at any number of controls, taking any 
form, at any location. It’s almost as if in addition to your design activities fo-
cused on the application, you are now responsible for redesigning the key-
board and mouse—for every application you create! This opens up a lot of 
options to you as a designer, and not all of those options are good. 
iPhone 
The iPhone’s smaller-scale form factor is easily held in hand. It is the es-
sence of contemporary mobile computing. A user can hold the device and 
manipulate all of the hard controls with one hand. Much thought went into 
the placement of the four buttons and one switch that constitute the physical 
controls on the device. The placement of those hard controls suggests that 
there is only one primary modality for holding the device, although we know 
that actually isn’t the case. 
Given the fact that you are trying to create a differentiated interaction model, 
there’s a good chance that you could arrive at a potential solution that meets 
all of your objectives, but is ultimately uncomfortable or impractical to use. 

iOS Wow Factor 
 
109  
There are six basic grip patterns, shown in Figures 7-1 to 7-6, for an iPhone 
that you always want to consider when designing your app. This doesn’t 
mean that your application layout needs to account for each one of these, 
though that would be great if it could. It just means that your design should 
work well with at least one grip in mind.

Obviously there are more ways to hold and interact with an iPhone than just 
the six positions outlined here, but I believe these six are representative of 
the most likely scenarios that you can expect to encounter. Each of these 
grips may influence the placement of controls or how you decide to structure 
the mechanics of a gesture. The position of the user’s hands and the orienta-
tion of the device can make a huge difference in the overall efficiency of an 
interaction. Experiment early and often with all of these different positions to 
get an understanding of how they might influence or alter your design solu-
tion. 
iPad 
The iPad presents a slightly different situation when it comes to physical in-
teraction. An iPad is significantly larger than an iPhone, and as I reviewed in 
Chapter 4, it’s targeted toward a different use-case that likely contributed 

iOS Wow Factor 
 
115  
significantly to determining its final form factor. We know that the iPad is 
focused more on a leisure-oriented computing experience. That type of expe-
rience often requires longer periods of engagement on the part of the user. 
This gives us the following scenario to contend with: 
 It’s a larger device.
 It’s used for longer periods of time.
These two factors imply that there are very few scenarios where an iPad will 
be used with just one hand. I’m not saying that it’s impossible to use with 
one hand, especially if it’s resting on a surface, but all of the two-handed 
scenarios are much more relevant. Let’s take a look at what those are in Fig-
ures 7-7 to 7-10:

As with the iPhone, be cognizant of your control positioning relative to how 
a user may be handling the device. 
Basic Layout Considerations 
I touched briefly on the ideas of scale and proximity in Chapter 2, but since 
this is such an important topic it’s worth reviewing in greater detail so you 
can make an informed decision about the layout of your user interface and 
how you manage the presentation of controls. Just to clarify, when I say con-
trol, I’m referring to any interactive object that appears on the screen of an 
iOS device.  
There are two basic factors you need to take into consideration when design-
ing any touch-based control: 

iOS Wow Factor 
 
119  
 Scale: The size of the target area for the control that you 
are designing.
 Proximity: How close that control is to the other user 
interface elements surrounding it.
These ideas apply equally to both the iPhone and the iPad and are somewhat 
independent of display resolution. I say “somewhat” because the overall 
resolution density of the iPad and iPhone is high enough that resolution isn’t 
really a factor anymore. 
So we have these two basic concerns, target size and target proximity. Before 
the iPhone era, I would be making some pretty explicit recommendations 
about the size of your touch targets. Up until just a few years ago it was con-
ventional wisdom up that touch targets could not be smaller than a specific 
minimum size without causing significant usability issues for the user. This 
minimum size was usually quoted to be something between 1 cm2 to 1.5 cm2. 
If you think about it, that’s a pretty big button, bigger than the app icons in 
iOS. To add to this, it was often recommended that touch targets be spaced 
apart by that same minimal area as well; in other words, spaced with a mini-
mum gap of 1 cm on each axis. There was a reason for this. The technologies 
that drove some of the older touchscreen systems were not all that accurate. 
In many cases, the mechanism sensing touch was offset spatially from the ac-
tual display itself. To have a usable system you had to account for all kinds 
of possible discrepancies, including misaligned touch sensors and the paral-
lax associated with an offset surface. Adding to that was the concern that us-
ers needed the psychological assurance of larger controls that appeared com-
fortably touchable. 
Luckily we don’t have to deal with all that anymore. However, you still want 
to be considerate of scale and proximity so as not to create too many chal-
lenges for the user. Scale is not so much an issue unto itself. The capacitive 
technology used in iOS devices is highly accurate and highly resolved. 
You’ve probably noticed this when browsing the Web on your iPhone. Even 
without enlarging the view, you can still tap those tiny little links on a web 
page with the edge of your pinkie finger. So I don’t necessarily want to be 
dogmatic about the minimum size of a touch target, at least not in a vacuum. 
The key to this is the understanding of proximity. 
Proximity is important just for the fact that the closer touch targets are to one 
another, the greater the chance of error on the part of the user. I think that’s 
pretty much common sense. But again, I don’t think we need to get dogmatic 

Chapter 7 | Control Mapping and Touchscreen Ergonomics 
 
120  
about spacing distance either because I don’t believe absolute values are use-
ful or even relevant, for that matter.  
Here’s how you need to think about control spacing: 
 The spacing between touch targets should be in-
versely proportional to the size of the adjacent 
targets (see Figure 7-11).


B

Figure 7-11. The spacing between touch targets should be inversely proportional to the size of 
the adjacent targets.  
That is, the greater the size of your touch targets, the closer they can be 
grouped together. Conversely, as your touch targets get smaller, they should 
be spaced farther apart. Smaller targets are more difficult to hit, and when 
mapped together in a dense configuration they will be prone to user error. 

iOS Wow Factor 
 
121  
Large targets are easy to hit, so they can be spaced closer together with less 
risk of user error.  
So have at it: make a button as big a single pixel, just know that it may be the 
only button on the screen when all is said and done!  
Feedback and Reactivity 
I want to add a few points about timing and reactivity as they may be applied 
to the interactions in your design. I already reviewed how the concept of time 
can be applied to resolve potential design problems and why animation is al-
ways an important consideration. But in this case I’ll be getting into a bit 
more detail about how to think about the response to input. 
Providing users with effective feedback for their system input is fundamental 
to any thorough design solution. Feedback confirms that an event has taken 
place, and that the system has captured the event. Typically this takes the 
form of simple state changes applied to the graphics that represent the point 
of interaction for any given control. In this sense, feedback serves a very 
pragmatic purpose that is valid in any interactive context. 
However, feedback presents another point of design differentiation that can 
add a layer of emotional engagement to an app when approached in the right 
way. So apart from the differentiated approach to your interaction model, be 
sensitive to the unit-level interactions embedded in the model itself. What I 
mean by this is that you still need to be aware of how the details of a specific 
interaction, like the touch of a button, affect your overall design solution. 
One of the most common complaints I hear from designers who are transi-
tioning into the mobile space for the first time is the lack of an “over” or 
“hover” state. Designers see this as an issue because over presents some in-
teresting creative possibilities. The thing is, over is just a feedback mechan-
ism and there are plenty of opportunities to incorporate elegant and creative 
feedback elsewhere. Let’s just think about the most basic event in a touch-
screen scenario: the touch itself. For the most part, the conventional approach 
to feedback on a touch event is just to do a simple state change in the appear-
ance of the control. I think the lack of creative thinking beyond the basic ap-
pearance swap is a holdover from previous technologies where the “mouse 
down” or “mouse click” event superseded any other system activity, thereby 
limiting the visual interaction that could occur. iOS exacerbates this conven-

tion by making state an inherent attribute of the control itself, allowing for 
the easy implementation of basic feedback.  
The idea of touch in the real world implies reaction and feedback. We live in 
world governed by well-established physical laws. We should look to our 
experience in the world to inform the nature of reactivity in our interface de-
signs. Knowing this, there is much more that can be applied to the touch 
event on the device to either add realism or interest for the user. Not only can 
we change the appearance of a control, we have the capability to change that 
appearance over time as well. Are there animated reactions to your unit-level 
interactions that you can apply to your design? Sure there are. Can we pro-
vide visual feedback, in real time, for our contact points on the screen while 
performing gestures? Of course. 
If you plan to integrate more robust feedback and reactivity into you designs, 
always be sensitive to timing. Timing refers to how quickly an event is trig-
gered, how quickly it is displayed, and the duration of the displayed effect. 
These are all very important factors because you need to be aware of how an 
animation or effect may impact the overall flow of a task. If a user has to 
wait for a sequence to finish before the system transitions to the next point in 
the workflow, then there is chance that the user may get frustrated. Like any-
thing else, there can be a fine line between frustration and engagement, so 
always be prepared to refine your solution in order to get this right. 
Prompting for Hidden Controls 
There are always going to be user interface solutions that require you to ac-
tively manage the presentation of controls on screen. I’m referring here to 
highly state-driven user interfaces where a control set must first be invoked 
by the user, before they are able to take action on the controls themselves. 
These types of user interface solutions can be problematic because they hide 
controls from the user. This seems counterintuitive from a usability perspec-
tive, but there are many valid situations where this is useful.  
The key to making these types of solutions successful is recognizing that you 
must provide some kind of prompt of hint for the action that reveals the con-
trol. This could be as simple as making all your hidden control sets visible 
when the app initially launches, making the user aware of their existence, 
then animating them off screen in some manner. You could even provide the 
user with explicit instructions in that initial launch state that describes the 

iOS Wow Factor

functions and the interaction required to bring them back onto the screen. 
This is especially useful for situations where the user is required to perform a 
specific gesture, rather than just a simple tap on the screen. 
When controls are in their hidden state, it may be useful to included a subtle, 
transparent icon or other visual indicator identifying the location of the con-
trol. You have time and state to work with as well, so maybe prompts can 
appear at critical points in a workflow, or appear at predefined intervals.  
Once a user becomes familiar with your app these prompts will not be re-
quired, so consider providing some user control within the app or in the Set-
tings application to manage this. Remember to communicate to the user that 
they can control this, so they don’t become frustrated down the road. 
Summary 
Let’s review what you’ve learned in this chapter on Control Mapping and 
Touch Screen Ergonomics: 
 Always consider the physical attributes of the device that 
you are designing for and how that may impact the usage 
of your application.
 Be conscientious of the scale and proximity of your con-
trols as you map them out across your application. The 
spacing between touch targets should be inversely      
proportional to the size of the adjacent targets to         
minimize the possibility of user error.
 There are many ways to integrate dynamic visual feedback 
into your application. Don’t ignore the unit-level interac-
tions; many creative possibilities can be applied at that  
level.
 If your design solution includes the possibility of hidden 
controls, always provide a prompting mechanism to  
communicate the behavior that reveals the control set.
