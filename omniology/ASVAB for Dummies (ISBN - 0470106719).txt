About the Authors
Rod Powers joined the United States Air Force in 1975 intending to become a spy. He was
devastated to learn that he should’ve joined the CIA instead because the military doesn’t
have that particular enlisted job. Regardless, he fell in love with the military and made it
both a passion and a career, retiring with 23 years of service. Rod spent 11 of those years as
a first sergeant, helping to solve the problems of the enlisted corps.
Since his retirement from the military in 1998, Rod has become a world renowned military
careers expert. Through his highly popular U.S. Military Information Web site on About.com
(http://usmilitary.about.com), Rod has advised thousands of troops about all aspects
of the U.S. Armed Forces career information.
Rod is the proud father of twin girls, both of whom enjoy successful careers in the United
State Air Force. Rod currently resides in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he attempts to prove
that there’s no such thing as too much sunshine. Even today, Powers tries to run his life
according to long-lived military ideals and standards, but he gets a bit confused about why
nobody will obey his orders anymore.
Jennifer Lawler has published nearly 20 books on topics ranging from country music to kick-
boxing. One of her books, Martial Arts For Dummies, was published by Wiley. A former college
English teacher, she taught test-prep skills to students before leaving the teaching profession to
become a full-time writer — not that teaching made her tear her hair out or anything.
Lawler never made it to boot camp, but she can do more pushups than a lot of people her
age. She teaches martial arts to children with special needs and lives with her daughter and
two rambunctious dogs.


Dedication
To Jeanie and Chrissy — because everything is for you. Always.

ASVAB For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Introduction
I
f you’re reading this book, there’s a very good chance that you want to join the United
States military. Perhaps it’s been your lifelong dream to drive a tank, fire a machine gun,
or blow things up (legally). Maybe you’ve always wanted to learn how to cook for 2,000
people at a time. Possibly you were attracted to the military because of education and train-
ing opportunities, the chance of travel, or huge enlistment bonuses.
In any event, by now you’ve discovered that you can’t just walk into a recruiter’s office and
say, “Hey, I’m here. Sign me up!” You’ve found out that the military requires you to pass an
entrance exam. Gone are the good old days when the entrance exam consisted of “Is he
breathing?” These days you have to pass something called the ASVAB.
The ASVAB (short for Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery) is unlike any test you’ve
ever taken. Sure, the test covers standard academic areas, such as math and English, but it
also measures your knowledge of other areas, such as mechanics, electronics, science, and
assembling objects. When was the last time your high school or college professor tested you
on putting a jigsaw puzzle together?
The good news is you need to do well on some of the subtests but not all of them. (When was
the last time you heard someone say, “Don’t bother studying for that”?) But we can’t tell you
which subjects and subtests are most important for your preparation. It’s a highly classified
military secret. Okay, not really. The order of importance of the subtests depends on you and
your career goals. You find out what you need to know to do well on all the subtests and then
get the info to determine which subtests are important to you.
We include charts and tables in this book to help you figure out the subtest scores that indi-
vidual military jobs require (see the Appendix). In fact, this study guide is the first to include
this information. So you can use ASVAB For Dummies, 2nd Edition, to ace the subtests that
make up the ASVAB and determine what subtests are important for your military-career goals.
About This Book
The paper versions of the ASVAB have eight subtests, and the CAT-ASVAB has nine, each of
which are covered in its own chapter in this book. This book shows you what to expect on
each subtest, offers strategies and tactics for studying each subject area, gives you test-
taking (and guessing) tips, and provides three full-length sample tests that help you deter-
mine your strengths and weaknesses. These sample tests also help you prepare mentally for
taking the real test — you can use them to get in the zone. We’ve thrown in an extra test, cov-
ering the four most important subtests of the ASVAB that make up the AFQT score (covered
in Chapter 1) at no extra cost.
Although much of the material covered on the ASVAB is taught in practically every high
school in the country, you could’ve slept through part of the info or performed a major brain-
dump as soon as the ink was dry on your report card. So you also get some basic review of
the relevant subject areas to help refresh your memory and include pointers on where to
find more information if you need it.

Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to help point out important con-
cepts and to help make the text easier to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont. Note: Some Web addresses may extend to two
lines of text. If you use one of these addresses, just type the address exactly as you see
it, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-understand definition.
 Bold text highlights important points and the action parts of numbered steps or
processes.
What You’re Not to Read
This book has a number of sidebars (the shaded gray boxes) sprinkled throughout. They’re
full of interesting information about the ASVAB, but you don’t have to read them if you don’t
want to — they don’t contain anything you simply must know in order to ace the test.
You also run across special icons, titled Technical Stuff, from time to time. These sections
include concise, detailed information (interesting but unessential) about the topic at hand,
but the info probably can’t help your ASVAB scores. You can safely skip these tidbits, if you
wish.
If you’re taking the ASVAB for the purpose of enlisting in the U.S. Military, you may even wish
to skip entire chapters, depending on your military career goals. For example, if the military
careers you’re interested in don’t require a score on the General Science subtest, you may
wish to skip that chapter and concentrate your study time on chapters that are required for
your particular job choices. For more about scores and how they relate to military job eligi-
bility, check out Chapter 2 and the Appendix.
Foolish Assumptions
While revising this book, we made a few assumptions about you — namely, who you are and
why you picked up this book. We assume the following:
 You aren’t a dummy. You just need a little help in passing the ASVAB.
 You may be a nervous test taker and have come here for help with test-taking tips and
other helpful information.
 You want a chance to take a few ASVAB practice tests to measure your current knowl-
edge in various subject areas in order to help you develop a study plan.

How This Book Is Organized
There is a method to the madness . . . a reason why this book is organized the way you see it
today. We’ve organized this book according to subject matter. Material having to do with words
is all grouped together, material having to do with math is all grouped together, and so on.

ASVAB For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

This book is not organized to reflect the order in which the subtests appear on the actual
ASVAB — rather, we organized it in the most logical fashion to help you study. For the order
of the tests on the ASVAB, check out the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book or in Chapter 1.
Part I: Forewarned is Forearmed: 
Understanding the ASVAB
If you have no clue as to how the ASVAB is organized or what it covers, turn to this part. This
part also tells you how scores are calculated and how the military bigwigs use the scores to
determine whether you qualify to join the military and what jobs you qualify for. Chapter 3
also contains some great study and test-taking tips.
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills
If you already know that you need help on a particular language arts-related subtest, turn to
Part II where you can pump up your vocabulary and reading comprehension skills.
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and 
War: Arithmetic Skills
Maybe math wasn’t your best subject in school. Maybe you love math, but you’ve forgotten
all of those equations. In either case, this section is all about math. So if you know that you
need to bone up on your mathematical skills, flip to Part III.
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills
If you’re interested in pursuing a military job that emphasizes science and technology (see
the Appendix of this book), and you want to make sure that you’re going to nail the corre-
sponding sections of the ASVAB, turn to Part IV.
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams
This part gives you three different tests to figure out what areas you need to brush up on.
Each test is a full-length sample test. Take the first one, and after that, check your answers,
and then you can determine which subtests are a piece of cake for you and where you need
the most help. Taking this approach lets you tailor a study plan to your individual needs.
(Even if you don’t have a lot of time for studying, taking the sample tests helps you prepare
for the real ASVAB exam.)
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This book is a For Dummies book, so it’s not complete without a Part of Tens. If you want to
get right down to it and find out some of the most important information for doing well on
the ASVAB and you like your info presented in easily digestible lists, turn to Part VI. This part
gives you test-taking tips and directs you to additional resources if you need them.

Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book from cover-to-cover in order to score well on the ASVAB.
People have different strengths and weaknesses and the format of this book is designed to
read in the manner that best suits you. You may be a wiz in math and choose to skip the
math sections entirely and use your study time in areas you feel you need to improve.
If you do choose to skip chapters, we highly recommend you skim through those chapters
anyway, taking note of Tip, Warning, and Remember icons, because these morsels of info
include important factors for your ASVAB score.
We suggest that you begin with Chapters 1 and 2, however. That way you can get a feel for
how the ASVAB is organized (along with the most up-to-date changes on the test) and what
particular subtests may be important for the military service branch and job of your choice.
This plan of attack helps you set up logical and effective goals to maximize your study efforts.
You may wish to start by taking one of the practice tests in Part V. By using this method, you
can discover which subjects are easier and which subjects you need to work on. If you
choose this technique, you can use the other practice tests to measure your progress after
reading through and studying the subject chapters.
No matter where you start, we wish you luck on taking this test, and if you’re one of the folks
who wants to join the military, we hope your journey is successful!

Part I
Forewarned Is Forearmed:
Understanding the ASVAB

In this part . . .
A
n ancient military proverb goes something like this:
“Understand your enemy, and you will avoid getting
shot in the buttocks.” Okay, that’s not a real ancient mili-
tary proverb. (In fact, we just made it up.) The point is
that understanding how the ASVAB is organized, how it’s
scored, and what those scores mean to you and your
potential military career, help you study for this nine-part
test more efficiently.
Even if you can’t control yourself and you want to jump
right in by reviewing the principles of algebra and memo-
rizing word lists, chill out and take a few minutes to read
through Part I. This part gives you an overview of the
ASVAB, describes what each part of the exam tests, tells
you when and where to take the test, and fills you in on
how the scores are calculated. We even throw in some
proven study techniques and test-taking strategies at no
extra cost.

In This Chapter
 Checking out the different versions of the ASVAB
 Figuring out what each subtest covers
 Computing the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score
 Taking the ASVAB again
T
he Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) consists of nine individual tests
that cover subjects ranging from general science principles to vocabulary. Your ASVAB
test results determine whether you qualify for military service (that part is so important it
has its own name — the AFQT) and, if so, what jobs you qualify for. The ASVAB isn’t an IQ
test. The military isn’t trying to figure out how smart you are. The ASVAB specifically meas-
ures your ability to be trained to do a specific job.
The famous Chinese General, Sun Tzu said, “Know your enemy.” In order to develop an effec-
tive plan of study and score well on the ASVAB, it’s important to understand how the ASVAB 
is organized and how the military uses the scores from the nine subtests. This chapter
describes the different versions of the ASVAB, the organization of the subtests, how the AFQT
score is calculated, and the various service policies for retaking the ASVAB.
An ASVAB by Any Other Name: 
Different Faces of the ASVAB
The ASVAB comes in many flavors, depending on where and why you take it. You would think
that after more than 25 years in existence, the test could’ve been whittled down to one single
version by now. But don’t get too confused about the different versions, though. The bullets
that follow boil down to choices:
 Institutional version: You take this pencil-and-paper version of the ASVAB as a junior
or senior in high school; it’s administered through a cooperative program between the
Department of Education and the Department of Defense at high schools all across the
United States (U.S.).
Although the results of this version can be used for military enlistment purposes (if
taken within two years of enlistment), its primary purpose is to provide a tool for high
school guidance counselors to use when recommending possible civilian career areas
to high school students. For example, if a student scores high in electronics, the coun-
selor can recommend electronic career paths. If a student is interested in military serv-
ice, the counselor then refers her to the local military recruiting offices.
 Production version: If you take the ASVAB through a military recruiter, you’re taking
the production version. This version of the ASVAB is used by all of the military
branches for the sole purpose of enlistment qualification and to determine which mili-
tary jobs a recruit can successfully be trained in. The production version is available in
two formats: paper and computerized. The vast majority of applicants are processed

through a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS), where they take the computer-
ized version of the ASVAB (called the CAT-ASVAB, short for computer-adaptive testing
ASVAB), undergo a medical physical, and run through a security screening all in one
trip. However, in a few cases, testers are offered the paper version, which is given by
MEPS personnel at several remote testing sites throughout the U.S.
 Computer Adaptive Screening Test (CAST) or Enlistment Screening Test (EST): These
tests are sort of mini-ASVABs you may take in the recruiter’s office. The EST and CAST
aren’t qualification tests; they’re strictly recruiting tools. These tests are management
screening tools that may be administered at the discretion of the recruiter. The EST
and CAST contain questions similar to, but not identical with, questions appearing on
the ASVAB. They’re used to help estimate an applicant’s probability of obtaining quali-
fying ASVAB scores.
If you take one of these mini-tests and score low, you probably don’t want to take the
actual ASVAB until you’ve put in some extensive study time (and this book can help
with that).
 Armed Forces Classification Test (AFCT): This version is given in-house to those people
already in the military. At some point during your military career, you may wish to retrain
for a different job. If you need higher ASVAB scores to qualify for such retraining, you can
take the AFCT. Except for the name of the exam, the AFCT is exactly the same as the
other versions of the ASVAB. This version is currently available only in pencil-and-paper
format, but the military plans to replace it with a computerized version in the near
future.
Mapping Out the ASVAB Subtests
The computerized format of the ASVAB contains nine separately timed subtests. The paper
format of the test only has eight subtests. The Assembling Objects (AO) subtest isn’t
included on any of the paper versions (for information on the AO subtest, see Chapter 14). In
Table 1-1, the nine ASVAB subtests are outlined in the order that you take them; you can also

The AFQT: Your Most Important Score
The ASVAB doesn’t have an overall score. When you hear someone say, “I got an 80 on my
ASVAB,” that person is talking about the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score, not
an overall ASVAB score. The AFQT score determines whether you qualify to even enlist in the
military, and only four of the nine subtests are used to compute it: Word Knowledge,
Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge.
Doing well on some of the other subtests is a personal-choice type of issue. Some of the sub-
tests are used only to determine the jobs you qualify for. (See Chapter 2 for more information
on how the military uses the individual subtests.) So you have to figure out which areas to
focus on based on your career goals. Here’s an example: If you’re not interested in a job
requiring a score on the Mechanical Comprehension subtest, you don’t need to worry about
doing well on that subtest. So, as you’re preparing for the ASVAB, remember to plan your
study time wisely. If you don’t need to worry about mechanical comprehension, don’t bother
with that chapter in this book. Spend the time on word knowledge or arithmetic reasoning.

Chapter 1: The ASVAB in a Nutshell
Tracing the testing trail
In 1948, Congress made the Department of Defense
develop a uniform screening test to be used by all the
services. The Defense Department came up with the
Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). This test con-
sisted of 100 multiple-choice questions in areas such as
math, vocabulary, spatial relations, and mechanical abil-
ity. The military used this test until the mid-1970s. Each
branch of the service sets its own minimum score.
When the military decides to do something, it often acts
with the lightning speed of a snail carrying a backpack. In
the 1960s, the Department of Defense decided to develop
a standardized military selection and classification test
and administer it in high schools. That’s where your old
buddy, the ASVAB, came from. The first ASVAB test was
given in 1968, but the military didn’t use it for recruiting
purposes for several years. In 1973, the draft ended and
the nation entered the contemporary period in which all
military recruits are volunteers. In 1976, the ASVAB
became the official entry test used by all services.
The ASVAB remained unchanged for several years until
in 1980 when the ASVAB underwent its first revision. The
subtest areas remained the same, but several of the
questions were updated to keep up with changes in
technology.
In 1993, the computerized version was released for lim-
ited operational testing, but it didn’t begin to see wide-
scale use until 1996. The questions on the computerized
version of the ASVAB were identical to the questions on
the paper version. It wasn’t until the end of 2002 that the
ASVAB finally underwent a major revision. Two subsets
(Coding Speed and Numerical Operations) were elimi-
nated and a new subtest (Assembling Objects, Chapter
14) was added to the computerized version. Also during
the 2002 revision, all of the questions were updated, and
the order in which the subtests were given was
changed. The revised ASVAB was first rolled out in the
computerized format, and the paper versions of the test
were updated during the next year.

If you don’t know what kind of job you want to do in the military, the ASVAB helps you and the
military determine your potential ability for different types of jobs. If you’re in this situation,
review all the chapters in this book, brushing up on the basic principles of everything from
science to electronics, but focus on the four subtests that enable you to qualify for enlist-
ment: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics
Knowledge. Following this plan ensures a relatively accurate appraisal of your aptitude for
various military jobs.
Interpreting the Multitude of Scores
The Department of Defense is an official U.S. Government agency, so (of course) it can’t keep
it simple. When you receive your ASVAB score results, you won’t see just one score; you’ll
see several. Figure 1-1 shows an example of an ASVAB score card used by high school guid-
ance counselors. (For those people who take the institutional version — see “An ASVAB by
Any Other Name: Different Faces of the ASVAB” for details.)
Figure 1-2 depicts an example of an ASVAB score card used for military enlistment purposes.
So, what do all these different scores actually mean? Check out the following sections to 
find out.
Defining all the scores
When you take a test in high school, you usually receive a score that’s pretty easy to 
understand — A, B, C, D, or F. If you do really well, the teacher may even draw a little smiley
face on the top of the page. If only your ASVAB scores were as easy to understand.

Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

In the following list, you see how your ASVAB test scores result in several different kinds of
scores:
 Raw score: This score is the total number of points you receive on each subtest of the
ASVAB. Harder questions on the ASVAB are worth more points than easier questions.
While you won’t see your raw scores on the ASVAB score cards, they’re used to calcu-
late the other scores.
 Standard scores: The various subtests of the ASVAB are reported on the score cards as
standard scores. A standard score is calculated by converting your raw score based on
a standard distribution of scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.
Don’t confuse a standard score with the graded-on-a-curve score you may have seen on
school tests — where the scores range from 1 to 100 with the majority of students scor-
ing between 70 and 100. With standard scores, the majority score is between 30 and 70.
That means that a standard score of 50 is an average score and a score of 60 would be
an above average score.
 Percentile scores: These scores range from 1 to 99. They express how well you did in
comparison with another group called the norm. On the institutional version’s score
card, the norm is fellow students in your same grade (except for the AFQT score).
On the production and institutional versions’ score cards, the AFQT score is presented
as a percentile score with the score normed by using the 1997 Profile of American
Youth, a national probability sample of 18- to 23-year-olds who took the ASVAB in 1997.
For example, if you receive a percentile score of 72, you can say you scored as well as
or better than 72 out of 100 of the norm group who took the test. (And by the way, this
statistic from 1997 isn’t a typo. The ASVAB was last “re-normed” in 2004, and the
sample group used for the norm was those folks who took the test in 1997.)

Chapter 1: The ASVAB in a Nutshell

 Composite scores (also referred to as line scores): Composite scores are individually
computed by each service branch. Each branch has its own particular system when
compiling various standard scores into individual composite scores. These scores are
used by the different branches to determine job qualifications. Much more about this
in Chapter 2.
You can’t use the practice tests in this book (or any other ASVAB study guide) to calculate
your probable ASVAB score. ASVAB scores are calculated by using raw scores, and raw
scores aren’t determined simply from the number of right or wrong answers. On the actual
ASVAB, harder questions are worth more points than easier questions.
Understanding the big four: Your AFQT scores
The four scores that comprise your AFQT score include the Word Knowledge, Paragraph
Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge subtests of the ASVAB.
The military brass (or at least its computers) determines your AFQT score through a very
particular process:
1. Add the value of your Word Knowledge score to your Paragraph Comprehension
score.
2. Convert the result of Step 1 to a scaled score, ranging from 20 to 62.
This score is known as your Verbal Expression or VE score.
3. To get your raw AFQT score, the computer doubles your VE score and then adds
your Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) score and your Mathematics Knowledge (MK) score
to it.
The basic equation looks like this: Raw AFQT Score = 2VE + AR + MK
4. Convert your raw score to a percentile score, which basically compares your results
to the results of thousands of other ASVAB test takers.
For example, a score of 50 means that you scored better than 50 percent of the individ-
uals the military is comparing you to.
The military’s AFQT score requirements for enlistment
AFQT scores are grouped into five main categories based on the percentile score ranges
shown in the following table. Categories III and IV are divided into sub groups because the
services sometimes use this chart for internal tracking purposes, enlistment limits, and
enlistment incentives. Based on your scores, the military decides how trainable you may be
to perform jobs in the service.

Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

The U.S. Congress has directed that the military can’t accept Category V recruits or more
than four percent of recruits from Category IV. If you’re in Category IV, you must have a high-
school diploma to be eligible for enlistment. Even so, if you’re Category IV, your chances of
enlistment are small and mostly limited to the army. See the nearby sidebar for details.
Depending on whether you have a high-school diploma or a GED, the military has different
AFQT score requirements. Check out Table 1-2 for these requirements.

At the time of this writing, the army has been
approving more and more waivers for those folks

order to meet its recruiting requirements.

Chapter 1: The ASVAB in a Nutshell
Meeting supply and demand
The United States Congress sets the authorized size
(called strength ceilings) for each of the service
branches. The army is the largest branch by far. In
order to maintain its strength ceiling, the active duty
army has to recruit 80,000 new troops each year.
Compare this number with the 36,000 for active duty
navy, 30,000 for active duty air force, 32,000 for the
Marine Corps, and 4,000 for the Coast Guard. Because
of these higher recruiting requirements and because
the army bears the brunt of deployments to such
places as Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo, the
army has been forced to lower many of its recruiting
standards. On the other hand, the army also offers
higher enlistment bonuses and other incentives than
do the other branches.
Congress sets the permissible ranges, but the individual
services can act within those ranges based on its cur-
rent recruiting needs. For example, Congress has set the
maximum allowable enlistment bonus to $40,000. But,
only the army offers the maximum, and then only for a
few “hard-to-fill” jobs. The air force (and the other serv-
ices) can also offer $40,000, if it felt it needed to, but it
doesn’t (the maximum bonus currently authorized by the
air force is $16,000 for a six-year enlistment as a Linguist.
The army, on the other hand, gives a $40,000 bonus to an
applicant who’s “trainable” for the linguist position for a
4-year enlistment).
The same is true on ASVAB Categories. Congress has
said that the maximum number of CAT IVs that any serv-
ice can accept per year is 4 percent. However, at this
time, the army is the only service branch that feels that
it has to allow a few of this category in to make its
recruiting goals (right now, about one percent of army
enlistments come from CAT 4A). The other services feel
they can make their goals without allowing CAT IVs in.
To further complicate matters, in 2006, Congress
increased the size of the active duty army by 30,000. In
2008, Congress plans to increase it by another 30,000
troops. In contrast, last year Congress decreased the
size of the active duty air force and navy, so these two
services are undergoing a downsizing for the next few
years, which means they’re accepting even fewer new
recruits than usual.

The military’s AFQT requirements for special programs
Achieving the minimum required AFQT score established by the individual branch gets your
foot in the door, but the higher you score the better. For example, if you need a medical or
criminal history waiver in order to enlist, the military personnel who make those decisions
are more likely to take a chance on you if they think you’re a pretty smart cookie, than if you
barely made the minimum qualifying score.
Individual branches of the military tie many special enlistment programs to minimum AFQT
scores:
 The army requires a minimum AFQT score of 50 to qualify for most of its incentive pro-
grams, such as a monetary enlistment bonus, college-loan repayment program, or the
Army College Fund.
 If you hope to be one of the very few people each year allowed to enlist in the air force
with a GED, you’ll need a minimum AFQT score of 65.
 Like the army, the Marine Corps requires a minimum AFQT score of 50 for most of its
incentive programs, including the Geographic Area of Choice Program, the Marine
Corps College Fund, and enlistment bonuses.
 The navy requires those folks with GEDs to have a minimum AFQT score of 50 to enlist.
Additionally, applicants who wish to participate in the Navy College Fund or college
loan repayment program need to achieve a minimum score of 50.
Note: The navy has also been known to raise its minimum AFQT requirements to 50 for
females (just to qualify for enlistment) when it receives too many female applicants.
(Because of the limited number of females that it can house on ships, the navy restricts
the number of females that can enlist each year.)
Enlistment programs are subject to change without notice based on the current recruiting
needs of the service. Your recruiter should be able to give you the most up-to-date informa-
tion, or visit http://usmilitary.about.com.
Failing to Qualify and Retaking the ASVAB
You can’t actually “fail” the ASVAB, but you can fail to achieve a high enough score to enlist
in the service branch you want. If this happens that means your AFQT score was too low,
which in turn means you need to work on one (or more) of the four core areas: Math
14
Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

Knowledge, Arithmetic Reasoning, Reading Comprehension, and Word Knowledge. Parts II
and III of this book are specifically designed to help you improve your scores on these four
subtests.
After you’re sure that you’re ready, you can apply (through your recruiter) for a retest. After
you take an initial ASVAB test (taking the ASVAB in high school doesn’t count as an initial
test), you can retake the test after 30 days. After the retest, you must wait at least six months
before taking the ASVAB again.
You can’t retake the ASVAB on a whim or whenever you simply feel like it. Each of the serv-
ices has its own rules concerning whether it’s allowed a retest. Check out the following sec-
tions for more information.
ASVAB tests are valid for two years, as long as you aren’t in the military. In most cases, after
you join the military, your ASVAB scores remain valid as long as you are in. In other words,
except in a few cases, you can use your enlistment ASVAB scores to qualify for retraining
years later.
U.S. Army retest policy
The army allows a retest in one of the following instances:
 If the applicant’s previous ASVAB test has expired
 The applicant failed to achieve an AFQT score high enough to qualify for enlistment
 When unusual circumstances occur, such as if an applicant, through no fault of his
own, is unable to complete the test
For example, an applicant is called away from test because of an emergency. This 
doesn’t include the requirement for an applicant to leave a test session because of an
illness that existed before the beginning of the session because applicants are routinely
cautioned not to take the test if ill.
Recruiters aren’t authorized to have applicants retested for the sole purpose of increasing
aptitude area scores to meet standards prescribed for enlistment options or programs.
U.S. Air Force retest policy
The intent of retesting an applicant is for the applicant to improve the last ASVAB test so the
enlistment options increase. Before any retest is administered, the recruiting flight chief must
interview the applicant in person or by telephone and then give approval for the retest.
Here are a few other polices to remember:
 The air force doesn’t allow retesting for applicants after they’ve enlisted in the Delayed
Entry Program (DEP).
 Current policy allows retesting of applicants who aren’t holding a job/aptitude area
reservation and/or aren’t in DEP but already have qualifying test scores.
 Retesting is authorized when the applicant’s current line scores (mechanical, adminis-
trative, general, and electronic) limit the ability to match an air force skill with his or
her qualifications.

Chapter 1: The ASVAB in a Nutshell

U.S. Navy retest policy
The navy allows retesting of applicants whose previous ASVAB tests have expired or if the
applicant fails to achieve a qualifying AFQT score for enlistment in the navy. In most cases,
individuals in the DEP can’t retest.
One notable exception is the navy’s DEP Enrichment Program. This program provides for the
provisional DEP enlistment of high-school diploma graduates with AFQT scores between 28
and 30. Individuals enlisted under the program are enrolled in academic enhancement train-
ing, retested with the ASVAB, and accessed to active duty provided they score 31 or higher
on the subsequent ASVAB retest.
U.S. Marine Corps retest policy
The Marine Corps authorizes a retest if the applicant’s previous test is expired. Otherwise,
recruiters can request a retest as long as the retesting is required due to the initial scores
(considering the applicant’s education, training, and experience) don’t appear to reflect his
or her true capability. Additionally, the retest can’t be requested solely because the appli-
cant’s initial test scores didn’t meet the standards prescribed for enlistment options or 
programs.
U.S. Coast Guard retest policy
For the Coast Guard enlistments, six months must elapse since an applicant’s last test before
he or she may retest solely for the purpose of raising scores to qualify for a particular enlist-
ment option. The Coast Guard Recruiting Center may authorize retesting after 30 days have
passed from an initial ASVAB test if substantial reason exists to believe the initial test scores
or subtest scores don’t reflect an applicant’s education, training, or experience.

So, You Want to be a Tank Driver? 
What It Takes to Get Your Dream Job
In This Chapter
 Finding out there’s more to life than the AFQT score
 Making sense out of line scores
 Discovering how each military branch uses line scores
T
he Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) portion of the ASVAB is your most impor-
tant score because it determines whether you can even join the service of your choice.
However, qualifying to join is only part of the picture. Unless you want to spend your mili-
tary career painting things that don’t move, you need to understand how the ASVAB relates
to various military job opportunities.
Civilian employers generally use a person’s education and experience level when selecting
candidates for a job position. In the military, 99 percent of all enlisted jobs are entry-level
positions. The military doesn’t require you to have a college degree in computer science
before you’re hired to become a computer programmer. You don’t even have to have any pre-
vious computer experience, nor does the military care if you do. You’re going to go to mili-
tary school to study how to make computers stand at attention and fly right.
Sounds like a good deal, right? So, what’s the catch? Well, believe us — the military spends
big bucks turning high school graduates into highly trained and skilled aircraft mechanics,
language specialists, and electronic doodad repair people. In an average year, the services
enlist about 274,000 new recruits. Any way you look at it, that’s a lot of combat boots! Each
and every recruit has to be sent to a military school to train for a job. Uncle Sam needs a way
to determine whether a wet-behind-the-ears high school graduate has the mental aptitude to
succeed at that job — preferably before he spends your hard-earned tax dollars.
Enter the ASVAB. The services combine various ASVAB subtests scores into groupings called
composite scores or line scores. Through years of trial and error, the individual military serv-
ices have each determined what minimum composite scores are required to successfully
complete its various job training programs. In this chapter, you discover how those test
scores translate into finding the military job of your dreams.
Determining How Your ASVAB Scores Affect
Your Enlistment in Job-Training Programs
Each service branch has its own individual system of scores. Recruiters and military job
counselors use these scores, along with other factors such as job availability, security clear-
ance eligibility, medical qualifications, and physical strength, to match potential recruits up
with military jobs.

When you sit down with your recruiter to discuss your ASVAB scores, you may think he sud-
denly decided to speak in a foreign language. Don’t get too confused about the terms used
for various scores on the ASVAB. The lingo is explained in detail in Chapter 1 (so you can flip
back to that chapter as needed). For job-qualification purposes, simple is better. Remember
three key terms and their definitions:
 Standard score: A standard score refers to individual ASVAB subtest scores (that is,
Verbal Expression, Arithmetic Reasoning, Mathematics Knowledge, and so on).
 Line score: A line score combines various standard scores that the services use for job
qualification purposes.
 AFQT score: Calculated from the math and English subtests of the ASVAB, the Armed
Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score is used by the military to determine overall enlist-
ment qualification. Chapter 1 explains exactly how this critical score is computed.
During the initial enlistment process your service branch determines your military job or
enlistment program based on established minimum line scores. If you get an appropriate
score in the appropriate areas, you can get the job you want — as long as that job is avail-
able and you meet other qualification factors.
For active duty, the army is the only service that offers a guaranteed job for all its new enlis-
tees. In other words, every single army recruit knows what her job is going to be before she
signs the enlistment contract.
The other active duty services use a combination of guaranteed jobs or guaranteed aptitude/
career areas:
 Air Force: About 40 percent of active duty air force recruits enlist with a guaranteed
job. The majority enlists in one of four guaranteed aptitude areas, and during basic
training recruits are assigned to a job that falls into that aptitude area.
 Coast Guard: The Coast Guard rarely, if ever, offers a guaranteed job in its active duty
enlistment contracts. Instead, new “Coasties” enlist as undesignated seamen, and
spend their first year (or so) of service doing general work (“Paint that ship!”) before
finally applying for specific job training.
 Marine Corps: A vast majority of Marine Corps active duty enlistees are guaranteed
one of several job fields, such as infantry, avionics, logistics, vehicle maintenance, air-
craft maintenance, munitions, and so on. Each of these fields is further divided into
specific subjobs, called Military Occupation Specialties (MOSs). Marine recruits usu-
ally don’t find out their actual MOS until about halfway through basic training.
 Navy: Most navy recruits enlist with a guaranteed job, but several hundred people
each year also enlist in a guaranteed career area, then “strike” (apply) for the specific
job within a year of graduating boot camp.
All enlistment contracts for the reserve forces (regardless of branch), on the other hand,
contain guarantees for a specific job. Why? Because reserve recruiters recruit for vacancies
in specific reserve units, usually located within 100 miles of where a person lives.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Service
Branches and Their Line Scores
Each of the military services computes its line scores differently:
18
Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

 The army combines the various scores into nine separate areas by simple addition of
the ASVAB standard scores.
 The Marine Corps computes its three line scores by adding subtest standard scores
from various ASVAB subtests.
 The navy and Coast Guard use the standard scores directly from the ASVAB subtests.
 The air force combines various standard scores into four aptitude areas and converts
each line score to a percentile score (just like the AFQT score).
As you read the following sections, you may notice that the Numerical Operations and
Coding Speed subtests are still used in calculating some of the line scores, even though they
were removed from the ASVAB (check out Chapter 1 for changes in the ASVAB). But hold
your horses — the explanation for this inconsistency is really quite simple. When the ASVAB
powers that be eliminated these subtests, the army, air force, and Marine Corps had a prob-
lem: These subtests were an intricate part of some of their line score calculations. To simply
remove them would require changing the line score minimums for each job that was associ-
ated with the particular score, which would in turn require revising every single regulation,
directive, manual, and instruction in which the particular line score was mentioned.
Those revisions seemed like a lot of work to the folks who write military regulations, and
after all, the holidays were coming up. Instead of changing the score minimums, the services
decided to insert a dummy score whenever the line score formula required the Numerical
Operations or Coding Speed standard scores. The dummy score is the average score received
for these two subtests by thousands of test takers, during the timeframe preceding when the
subtests were eliminated. Because everyone gets the same dummy score addition(s), you
can safely ignore this tidbit of information and pretend it doesn’t exist.
Line scores and the army
The army adds various standard scores from the individual subtests of the ASVAB to com-
pute line scores for job qualification. Table 2-1 shows the line scores and the ASVAB subtests
that make them up:

 Arithmetic Reasoning (AR)
 Word Knowledge (WK)
 Paragraph Comprehension (PC)
 Auto & Shop Information (AS)
 Mathematics Knowledge (MK)
 Mechanical Comprehension (MC)
 Electronics Information (EI)
 Assembling Objects (AO)
 Verbal Expression (VE; the sum of WK and PC)
Check out this example: The navy regulation, which lists the qualifications to become an Air
Traffic Control Specialist, states that an ASVAB score of VE + AR + MK + MC = 210 is required.
In order to qualify for an Air Traffic Control Specialist, you need a 210 or higher in these
areas.
What a minute! If the navy and Coast Guard don’t use line scores, what are the navy and
Coast Guard scores on your ASVAB score sheet? Good question. The navy and Coast Guard
got jealous over the other branches having line scores on the ASVAB score sheets, so 
these two branches invented their own, even though they don’t use them. Actually, we’re 
just kidding.
Although the navy and Coast Guard don’t use their line scores for official job determination,
the scores provide recruiters, job counselors, and recruits with a snapshot of which broad
career areas they may qualify for. The navy and Coast Guard line scores shown on the ASVAB
score sheet comprise the areas as listed in Table 2-2.

Line scores and the air force
The U.S. Air Force uses standard scores from the ASVAB subtests to derive scaled scores in
four aptitude areas called MAGE (Mechanical, Administrative, General, and Electronics). The
air force MAGE scores are calculated as percentiles, ranging from 0 to 99, which show your
relationship to thousands of others who’ve taken the test. In other words, a percentile score
of 51 indicates you scored better in this aptitude area than 50 percent of the testers who
were used to establish the “norm.” Table 2-4 lays out the four areas, the subtests used, and
the formulas used to calculate the percentile for a particular area. After the test scorer calcu-
lates the score for a particular area, she converts that score to a percentile.

Test-Taking and Study Techniques
In This Chapter
 Choosing your weapon: Pencil or keyboard
 Developing multiple-choice strategies
 Making educated guesses
 Getting some studying and test tips
 Preparing down to the last detail
H
ow many times have you heard someone say (or may have even said yourself), “I just
can’t take tests?” Well, of course you can’t do well on tests if you keep telling yourself
that! In basic training, your Drill Sergeant (hereafter known as “Sir” or “Ma’am”) will convince
you that the words “I can’t” simply don’t exist in the military. If you don’t believe us, try telling
your Drill Sergeant, “I just can’t do push-ups.” You will find that with sufficient practice (and
your Drill Sergeant will ensure you get a lot of practice), you can do push-ups just as well as
the next person. (Actually, we don’t really recommend using this example to test this hypothe-
sis, for reasons that should be obvious.) The truth is that those who do well on tests are those
who’ve learned to study efficiently, along with a dash of test-taking psychology.
This chapter includes information on how to prepare for the test — how you study and how
and why you should take the practice exams. In addition, you get some inside info like
secrets for guessing when you don’t know the answer to a question. (Although, if you study
for the test, that will never happen, right?) The tips and techniques provided in this chapter
can help you get a jump on the ASVAB and your military career.
Knowing What You’re Up Against: The Pros 
and Cons of Paper versus Computer
As mentioned in Chapter 1, many versions of the ASVAB exist (although you probably won’t
get a choice of which one to take), but they primarily boil down to two basic differences: 
the paper version and the computerized version. Each version has its advantages and 
disadvantages.
 If you’re taking the ASVAB as part of the Institutional Program in high school, or if
you’re already in the military and retaking the ASVAB for the purposes of qualifying to
retrain into a different job, you’ll take the paper version.
 If you’re taking the ASVAB as part of the process of enlisting in the military, you’ll take
the Production ASVAB. This version is available in paper format and via computer,
called the CAT-ASVAB. There’s a 90 percent chance that you’ll take the computerized
version because to save time and money, the recruiting services like to send applicants
to the nearest Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) for testing, medical exami-
nation, and enlistment (one-stop shopping). The computerized version is used exclu-
sively at MEPS.

If you have your heart set on taking the paper version of the test but didn’t do so in high
school, ask your recruiter if a Mobile Examining Team (MET) site is nearby. Roughly 685 MET
sites are located throughout the United States (U.S.). Most localities also have scheduled
days when the paper version of the Production ASVAB is given (once or twice per month),
usually at the local National Guard Armory. If you want to take the paper-based test at an
armory or a similar site, a military recruiter must put you on the schedule.
The old-fashioned way: Advantages and 
disadvantages of the paper ASVAB
Modern technology isn’t always better. Taking the pencil-and-paper version of the ASVAB can
provide you with certain advantages:
 You can skip questions that you don’t know the answer to and come back to them
later. This option can help when you’re racing against the clock and want to get as
many answers right as possible. You can change an answer on the subtest you’re cur-
rently working on, but you can’t change an answer on a subtest after the time for that
subtest has expired.
 You can mark up the exam booklet as much as you want. If you skip a question, you
can circle the number of the question in your booklet to remind yourself to go back to
it. If you don’t know the answer to a question, you can cross off the answers that seem
unlikely or wrong to you and then guess based on the remaining answers.
Killing trees isn’t the only disadvantage of the paper-based test. Other drawbacks include
 Harder questions are randomly intermingled with easier questions. This means you
can find yourself spending too much time trying to figure out the answer to a question
that’s too hard for you and may miss answering some easier questions at the end of the
subtest, thereby lowering your overall score.
 The paper answer sheets are scored by using an optical scanning machine. The
machine has a conniption when it comes across an incompletely filled-in answer circle
or stray pencil marks and will often stubbornly refuse to give you credit, even if you
answered correctly.
 Getting your scores can take forever. The timeline varies, but it may take a week or
more (sometimes up to a month — remember, we’re talking military efficiency here).
Modern technology: Advantages and 
disadvantages of the CAT-ASVAB
The computerized version of the ASVAB, called Computerized Adaptive Testing, or CAT-
ASVAB, contains the same questions as the paper version, but the questions are presented 
to you in a different order. The CAT-ASVAB adapts the questions it offers you based on your
level of proficiency (that’s why it’s called adaptive). Translation: The first test item is of aver-
age difficulty. If you answer this question correctly, the next question is more difficult. If you
answer it incorrectly, the computer gives you an easier question. (By contrast, on the paper
ASVAB, hard and easy questions are presented randomly.)
Maybe it’s because young people today are more comfortable in front of a computer than
with a pencil, but military recruiters have noted that among applicants who’ve taken both
the paper-based and computerized versions of the ASVAB, recruits tend to score slightly
higher on the computerized version of the test.
24
Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

You don’t have to be a computer guru to appreciate the advantages of the computerized ver-
sion of the ASVAB:
 Unlike the paper ASVAB, on the CAT-ASVAB, it’s impossible to record your answer in
the wrong space on the answer sheet. Questions and possible answers are presented
on the screen, and you press the key that corresponds to your answer choice before
moving on to the next question.
 The difficulty of the test items presented depends on whether you answered the pre-
vious question correctly. If you’re proficient in the subtest area, you get the harder
questions (which are worth more points) out of the way first, which maximizes your
score in the event that you don’t complete all the questions on the subtest. 
 You get your scores right away. The computer automatically calculates and prints
your standard scores for each subtest and your line scores for each service branch.
(For more on line scores, see Chapter 2.) This machine is a pretty smart cookie — it
also calculates your AFQT percentile score on-the-spot. As emphasized in Chapter 1,
the AFQT score determines whether you even qualify to join the service of your choice.
With the computerized version, you usually know if you qualify for military enlistment
on the same day you take the test, and if so, which jobs you qualify for.
On the downside, you can’t skip questions or change your answers after you enter them on the
CAT-ASVAB. This restriction can make taking the test harder for some people. Instead of being
able to go through and immediately answer all the questions you’re sure of and then coming
back to the questions that require you to do some head scratching, you have to answer each
question as it comes. This can make it difficult to judge how much time to spend on a difficult
question before guessing and moving on. Also, if you have a few minutes at the end of the test,
you can’t go back and check to make sure you marked the correct answer to each question.
Attacking the Infamous Multiple-
Choice Questions
Both the paper-based and the computerized ASVAB are multiple-choice tests. You choose the
correct (or most correct) answer from among four choices. Here are some tips to keep in
mind as you tackle the choices:
 Read the directions carefully. Each subtest has a paragraph or two describing what
the subtest covers and instructions on how to answer the questions. Although instruct-
ing you to read the directions may seem obvious, when you’re in a hurry, you can
sometimes misread the directions, and that won’t help you get the right answer. For
example, if the directions on Paragraph Comprehension subtest informs you that a
paragraph applies to questions number 3, 4, and 5, and you misread it as 4, 5, and 6,
you’re going to get at least one of those questions wrong.
Most ASVAB test proctors agree — the majority of the time when there’s an issue with
an applicant’s scores, the misreading of directions is the prime offender.
 Make sure you understand the question. If you don’t understand the question, you’re
naturally not going to be able to make the best decision when it comes to selecting an
answer. Understanding the question, though, requires attention to three particular points:
• Take special care to read the questions correctly. Most questions ask something
like, “Which of the following equals 2 × 3?” But sometimes, a question may ask,
“Which of the following does not equal 2 × 3?” You can easily skip right over the
word not when you’re reading, assume that the answer is six, and get the ques-
tion wrong.
25
Chapter 3: Test-Taking and Study Techniques

• On the math subtests, be especially careful to read the symbols correctly.
When you’re in a hurry, the + sign and the ÷ sign can look very similar. And blow-
ing right by a negative sign or another symbol is just as easy.
• Make sure you understand the terms being used. When a math problem asks
you to find the product of two numbers, be sure you know what finding the prod-
uct means. (It means you have to multiply the two numbers.) If you add the two
numbers together, you arrive at the wrong answer.
 Take time to review all the answer options. On all the subtests, you select the correct
answer from four possible answer options.
Often, a person reads a question, decides on the answer, glances at the answer options,
chooses the option that agrees with his or her answer, marks it on the answer sheet,
and then moves on. Although this approach usually works, it can sometimes lead you
astray.
On the ASVAB, you’re supposed to choose the answer that is most correct. (Now and
then you do the opposite and choose the answer that is least correct.) Sometimes sev-
eral answers are reasonably correct for the question at hand, but only one of them is
the best answer. If you don’t stop to read and review all the answers, you may not
choose the one that is most correct. Or, if you review all the answer options, you may
realize that you hastily decided on an incorrect answer because you misread it.
 If you’re taking a paper test, mark the answer carefully. A machine scores the ASVAB
paper-based answer sheets. You have to clearly mark the answer so that the machine
knows what answer you’ve selected. This means carefully filling in the space that rep-
resents the correct letter answer. You’ve done this a million times in school, we know,
but it’s worth repeating. Don’t use a check mark, don’t circle the answer, and don’t let
your mark wander into the next space. If you must erase, make certain that all evi-
dence of your prior choice is gone; otherwise, the grading machine can get confused
and credit you with the wrong choice or, worse, disregard your answer and give you no
credit at all.
On the paper version, the very real possibility exists of incorrectly marking the answer
sheet — answering Question 11 on the line for Question 12, Question 12 on the line for
Question 13, and . . . you get the idea. (Don’t laugh — this happens more often than you
would guess.) Be especially careful if you skip a question that you’re going to return to
later.
Incorrectly marking the answers can cause a real headache. If you fail to get a qualify-
ing score, the minimum amount of time you must wait before retaking the ASVAB is 30
days — you have to wait a whole month to do it all over again. Even then, your journey
to military glory through ASVAB torment may not be over. Regulations allow the test-
ing-center commander to request another retest if a 20-point or greater difference
between two test results pops up. So, if you’re not careful, you’ll be taking three
ASVABs when all you really needed to take was one. Sound fun? Chapter 1 discusses
how and when you can re-take the ASVAB.
Conundrum! When You Have to Guess
On the ASVAB, guessing is okay. In fact, it’s encouraged. The reason is in the scoring of the
test. Here’s how the point system breaks down:
 If you choose the correct answer, you get one point (or more, depending on how the
question is weighted).
 If you don’t answer a question, you get nada.
 If you guess on a question and get the question wrong, you get nada — no worrying
about losing points or getting any sort of penalty!
26
Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

So, because each question has four possible answers, you have a 25 percent chance of guess-
ing correctly, which means that you have more chances to increase your score by guessing
than by leaving a question blank.
If you guess on more than one question throughout the test, always choosing the same
answer for every guess is the smart way to go. For example, all your guesses could be the
Answer (B). This technique slightly increases your chances of getting more guessed answers
correct. This method doesn’t hold true, though, if you can narrow down a guess by eliminat-
ing a couple of answer options — called making an educated guess. If you can eliminate
Answer (B), then, by all means, choose a different answer option as your guess.
In each of the chapters in this book that reviews a particular subtest, you find hints for
making educated guesses that are specific to that topic. But here are some general rules:
 Usually, an answer that has always, all, everyone, never, none, or no one is incorrect.
 If two choices are very similar in meaning, neither of them is probably the correct choice.
 If two answer options contradict each other, one of them is usually correct.
 The longer the answer, the more likely that it’s the correct answer. The test makers
have to get all those qualifiers in there to make sure that it’s the correct answer and 
so you can’t find an example to contradict it. If you see phrases like in many cases or
frequently, that’s a clue that the test takers are trying to make the answer most correct.
 There’s always at least one answer that isn’t even close to the correct answer. By using
simple deduction, you can often narrow your choices down to two answers or less.
 Don’t eliminate an answer based on the frequency of that answer coming up. For exam-
ple, if Choice (B) has been the correct answer for the last five questions, don’t assume
that it must be the wrong answer for the question you’re on just because that would
make it six in a row.
 Don’t change an answer after you select it. If you have to guess, never, ever go back
and change the answer, unless you’re absolutely, 100 percent, positively convinced that
you’re changing it to the correct answer and you only answered incorrectly because
you had sweat in your eyes and didn’t read the choices properly.
The United Stated Air Force Senior NCO Academy conducted an in-depth study of sev-
eral air force multiple-choice-test results, taken over several years, and found that
when students changed answers on their answer sheets, they changed from a right 
to a wrong answer more than 72 percent of the time!
By taking the practice tests at the back of the book, you can get a sense of how long it takes
you to complete each part of the ASVAB. This little nugget of info can help you know how
much time you have to spend on educated guessing.
Training the Way You Fight: Study 
Tips and Practice Tests
The three full-length practice tests and the AFQT practice test at the back of this book are
valuable study aids. Before you begin studying, take one of the tests. Try to duplicate the
testing environment — take the entire exam at one time, time yourself, and don’t allow inter-
ruptions. When you complete the first practice test, check your answers to see where you
need improvement.
27
Chapter 3: Test-Taking and Study Techniques

Don’t forget, not all subtests are equally important. For instance, if you have no interest in
pursuing a career in electronics, the Electronics Information subtest is irrelevant to you; so
don’t spend time studying for it. Instead, devote yourself to other areas that are important to
your future career plans. (See Chapter 2 for lists of the subtests that affect your acceptance
into the job area or areas you’re pursuing.)
Train the way you fight is a standard saying in the military. When you study for the ASVAB, fall
in line with these study habits to make the most of your time:
 Try to reduce distractions. Always study in a well-lit, quiet area away from pets,
screaming babies, and the TV.
 Keep study breaks to a minimum. A few minutes every hour is sufficient.
 Be a loner. You may want to study with a partner now and then so the two of you can
brainstorm answers and quiz each other, but most of your studying should be done on
your own.
 Study in long blocks of time. Studying for an hour or two once or twice a day is much
more effective than 15 minutes six times a day.
 Concentrate on subject areas that need improvement. It’s human nature to find your-
self spending your study time on subject areas that you have an interest in or that
you’re good at. If you’re a wiz at fixing cars, don’t waste your time studying auto and
shop information. (You’re already going to ace that part of the test, right?) On the other
hand, if you had a hard time in math during your high school years, you need to spend
extra time brushing up on your arithmetic skills.
 Practice the actual act of test-taking. Practice marking answers correctly on the
answer key and time yourself to see how long it takes you to answer questions. See
Chapter 1 for details about how long it should take you to complete each subtest.
After you do some additional studying, take the second practice exam. Again, try to duplicate
testing conditions. Check your answers. Compare your scores to the scores from your first
test. Have you improved? If so, continue studying as you have been. If not, you may need to
reconsider how you’re studying or if you’re setting aside enough time to study. A school
counselor or teacher can give you additional study pointers.
Finally, a week or two before the ASVAB, take the third practice test. Think of the third test as
a final chance to brush up on any of those nagging areas that still give you fits. This third test
also helps you calm your nerves before taking the ASVAB — how the test works will be fresh
in your mind.
Don’t waste time memorizing the practice questions in this guide or any other ASVAB study
guide. You will not see the same questions on the ASVAB test. Use this guide and the sample
tests for two purposes:
 To determine the subject areas in which you need to improve: Use the tips and tech-
niques, along with standard study materials (like high-school textbooks), to improve
your knowledge of that specific subject.
 To familiarize yourself with the types of test questions and the way they’re pre-
sented on the test: Getting a good idea of what all the subtests look like and ask for will
improve your test-taking speed. You won’t have to spend time trying to figure out how
a question works. You can spend your time answering the question.
28
Part I: Forewarned Is Forearmed: Understanding the ASVAB 

24 Hours and Counting: Pretest Preparations
You want some good advice? On the night before the test . . . get some sleep. Give yourself
time to get plenty of rest — at least eight hours of sleep. Don’t drink alcohol the night 
before — headaches and the ASVAB don’t work well together. And don’t pull an all-night
cram session the night before you’re scheduled to take the ASVAB. If you don’t know the
material by then, it’s too late. Staying up all night only guarantees that you’ll do poorly on
the test because you’ll be too tired in the morning.
Here are some other suggestions:
 On the morning of the test, eat a light meal — anything too heavy will make you
drowsy, but not eating enough will make it hard for you to concentrate.
Try to avoid a breakfast high in carbohydrates. While the carbs will initially make you
feel energetic, a couple of hours into the test, you may come crashing down. Select
foods high in protein instead.
 Get exercise the day before and even the morning of the test to get your blood pump-
ing and help you remain mentally sharp.
 If you’re sick, upset, or injured, you may want to reschedule the test. Right before the
test starts, the proctor will ask if there’s anything, such as sickness or injury, which
may affect your test performance. After the test actually starts, it’s considered to be 
an “official test,” and there will be a time period before any possibility of a retest. See
Chapter 1 for complete details.
 Bring any supplies you need: pencils, pens, and erasers. Scratch paper will be provided
for you. If you wear eyeglasses, bring them. If you wear contacts, bring your glasses as
a backup.
 Bring a watch to help you keep track of time if you’re taking the paper version (the
computerized version has a clock on the screen).
 Don’t bring calculators, personal CD players, backpacks, or a cooler of munchies to the
testing site. You won’t be allowed to have them with you.
 Don’t drink a lot of liquids just before the test — you don’t want to waste valuable test
time in the bathroom!
 Make sure you arrive at the test site with plenty of time to spare. In the military, arriv-
ing on time means that you’re five minutes too late. You should plan to be in your seat
at least 10 minutes before the scheduled testing time. Unless your recruiter is driving
you (which is often the case), you may wish to do a “test run” a day or two before your
testing date to make sure you know where the location is, the availability of parking,
and how to find the testing room.

he ASVAB measures your communication skills
through two subtests: Word Knowledge and Paragraph
Comprehension. Together, these two subtests make up
one-half of your Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)
score, which the military uses to predict whether you’re
teachable. If you don’t achieve a qualifying score on the
AFQT, you’re not allowed to play alongside the other
soldiers.
In this part, you discover why it’s important to do well on
the ASVAB vocabulary and reading subtests, and you find
some useful tools to accomplish the mission. You review
basic vocabulary and reading skills and find rock-solid
advice like how to find the main idea of a paragraph and
quick tips to understanding the definition of a vocabulary
word based on context, roots, prefixes, and suffixes.

 Keeping a word list
 Knowing the difference between synonyms and antonyms
 Improving your overall vocabulary
T
o make it to boot camp, you’d better know how to spell it, along with an army of other
vocab words, to score well on the Word Knowledge section of the ASVAB. Not only do
you have to know how to spell to some degree (so you can differentiate among words), 
but also you need to know what the words on the test mean. Word Knowledge just means
vocabulary, which means hard words no one uses in ordinary conversation. (Well, not really.) 
If you’re on a military base and you’re hungry, don’t bother looking for a sign that says
Chow Hall. Instead, you need to find the Enlisted Personnel Dining Facility. If you want to
work out after your big lunch, forget about the Base Gym. You’re looking for the Fitness and
Wellness Center.
So, what if you don’t know the difference between a carbine and a carbon? Never fear — 
we’re here to give you a helping hand (bestow upon you inestimable guidance and 
encouragement — that’s Word Knowledge speak). With the help of this chapter (and a 
little brow-sweat on your part), your word knowledge skills will whip right into shape. (And
then in Chapter 6, check out the practice questions to test your word knowledge skills.)
The Importance of Word Knowledge 
for Military Jobs
Word Knowledge isn’t part of the ASVAB just because the military likes to use big words. It’s
included because words stand for ideas, and the more words you understand, the more ideas
you can understand (and the better you can communicate with others). A decent vocabulary
is essential in the military if you want to get ahead. The military operates on paperwork,
and whether you’re trying to get more supplies (submit necessary logistical requisitions) or
get the assignment you want (application for personnel career-enhancement programs), you
need to develop a good vocabulary. The military considers clear and concise communication
so important that it’s taught and graded at all levels of leadership training, including the Army,
Navy, and Air Force War Colleges, which are requirements to be promoted to General officer.
The Word Knowledge subtest is one of the four most important subtests on the ASVAB (along
with the Paragraph Comprehension, Mathematics Knowledge, and Arithmetic Reasoning).
The Word Knowledge subtest comprises a significant portion of the AFQT score — the score
that determines your eligibility for military service (see Chapter 1 for details).

You also need to do well on the Word Knowledge subtest in order to qualify for many military
jobs such as air traffic controller, military intelligence, and even fire fighting. Table 4-1 shows
the military job qualification line scores that are calculated by using your Word Knowledge
subtest score.

Checking Out the Word Knowledge 
Question Format
The Word Knowledge portion of the ASVAB measures your vocabulary knowledge. The sec-
tion consists of 35 questions, which usually come in one of two flavors:
 The first type asks for a straight definition.
 The second type gives you an underlined word used in the context of a sentence.
When you’re asked for a straight definition, your task is quite simple: Choose the answer
closest in meaning to the underlined word. Look at the following example:
Abatement most nearly means:
(A) encourage
(B) relax
(C) obstruct
(D) terminate
Abatement means to suppress or terminate. In this case, the correct answer is Choice (D).
When you see an underlined word in a sentence, your goal is to choose the answer closest in
meaning to the underlined word. For example:
His house was derelict:
(A) solid
(B) run-down
(C) clean
(D) inexpensive
34
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

Closest in meaning doesn’t mean the exact same thing. You’re looking for similar or related
words. In case you’re wondering, the answer is Choice (B).
When you take the Word Knowledge subtest, you have 11 minutes to answer the 35 ques-
tions, which means that you have slightly less than 20 seconds to answer each question.
That’s plenty of time, as long as you stay focused and don’t waste time thinking about last
night’s date (sorry, we mean social encounter).
Keep in mind that although you may know the word in the question, you may not know one
or more of the words in the multiple-choice answers. If this is the case, use the process of
elimination to help you narrow down your choices. Eliminate the words that you know aren’t
correct, and guess which of the remaining words is most likely correct.
Building Words from Scratch: Strategies 
to Help You Decipher Word Meanings
Many English words are created from building blocks called roots, prefixes, and suffixes.
These basic word parts generally have the same meaning in whatever word they’re used. For
instance, pro means something along the lines of in favor of, forward, or positive whether you
use it in the word proton or the word proceed.
If you memorize some of these word parts, you have a better chance of figuring out the
meaning of an unfamiliar word when you see it on the ASVAB. Figuring out the meaning of
unfamiliar words is how people with large vocabularies make them even larger. (They look
up words in the dictionary, too.)
Developing a large vocabulary takes time — often years. However, just because you have a
limited amount of time to study doesn’t mean you should give up hope. Instead, focus on the
tips throughout this section to help you improve your Word Knowledge score.
From beginning to end: Prefixes and suffixes
Prefixes, roots, and suffixes are the main parts that make up words. Not every word has all
three, but many have at least one. Prefixes are the parts that come at the front of a word, suf-
fixes are the parts that come at the end of a word, and roots are the parts that lie in the
middle of a word. Think of roots as the base of the word and prefixes and suffixes as word
parts that are attached to the base. (Check out the “Determining the root of the problem”
section later in this chapter for more info on — you guessed it — roots.)
Tables 4-2 and 4-3 list some common prefixes and suffixes. Each list has the word part, its
meaning, and one word that uses each word part. Writing down additional words that you
know for each word part helps you memorize the list.

Determining the root of the problem
Root words are word parts that serve as the base of a word. If you recognize a root, you can
generally get an idea of what the word means, even if you’re not familiar with it. When you
see an unfamiliar word on the Word Knowledge section, don’t get upset and pound on the
computer (they make you pay for those things if you break them). You may know the word
after all . . . just in a different form.
In English, one root word can be changed slightly to perform all sorts of roles — it can act as a
noun, a verb, an adjective, or an adverb with just a little modification. So, for example, if you
know what the root word attach means, you can figure out what the word attachment means. If
you know adherent, you can deduce what adherence means. As Mr. Miyagi said in Karate Kid,
“Root strong, tree grow strong.” All right, Daniel-san, in terms of your vocabulary — if your
knowledge of word roots is strong, your vocabulary will be much stronger (larger).
Suppose you run across the word beneficent on the Word Knowledge portion:
Beneficent most nearly means:
(A) kind
(B) beautiful
(C) unhappy
(D) troubled
You sit there in the school-cafeteria chair and begin to sweat. You’ve never seen the word
before, and it’s all over for you, right? Well, maybe not. Take a closer look. What other word
starting with the letters benefi do you know? How about the word benefit? A benefit is some-
thing that helps or aids. It would be a good bet that the word beneficent is related to helping
or aiding. So when you look over the possible choices, you can choose the one that has
something to do with helping.
37
Chapter 4: Word Knowledge

But wait! None of the answers state help or aid. Now what? Just use the process of elimina-
tion. If something is helpful (beneficent), it probably isn’t troubled or unhappy. It may be
beautiful, but more likely, it’s kind. So the best answer would be Choice (A).
Table 4-4 lists some common roots. Memorize them. When you sit down to take the ASVAB,
you’ll be glad that you did.

When you see an unfamiliar word, try dropping a couple of letters from the beginning and/or
the end of the word to see if you recognize what’s left — the root. If so, you can make a good
guess as to the meaning of the word.

Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

Ying and Yang: Understanding 
Synonyms and Antonyms
A synonym is a word that has the same meaning as or a very similar meaning to another
word. Smile and grin are synonyms. They may not mean exactly the same thing, but their
meanings are very similar. An antonym is a word that has an opposite or nearly opposite
meaning as another word. Smile and frown are antonyms.
To help remember the definitions of synonym and antonym, think of a synonym as the same
(both also start with an s) and an antonym as the enemy.
The ASVAB may ask you to find the word that most nearly means the same thing as a given
word, which is a synonym. Or you may be asked to find the word that most nearly means the
opposite of a given word, which is an antonym. Most of the questions on the Word Knowledge
subtest ask you to find synonyms, although a few may ask you to find antonyms.
How can you study and find the synonym of a word (or the antonym, for that matter)? Take a
look at these suggestions:
 Start in the dictionary. Many dictionary entries include the abbreviation syn, which
means synonym. The words that follow this abbreviation are synonyms of the entry
word. You may also see the abbreviation ant in an entry. This abbreviation stands for
antonym, and the word or words that follow it mean the opposite of the entry word.
 Make a list of synonyms and antonyms of the words you learn. As you study vocabu-
lary words for the Word Knowledge subtest, add them to your list.
 Use the root-word list from Table 4-4 (in the preceding section). Using your dictionary
and thesaurus, come up with a list of synonyms and antonyms for each word listed in
the Sample Word column. (Of course, not every word has synonyms and antonyms, but
many do.)
You Are What You Speak: Improving Your
Vocabulary, Improving Yourself
Having an extensive vocabulary can help you do well on the Word Knowledge subtest. But,
even if you don’t have a huge vocabulary, the strategies in this section can help you make up
for that.
You can acquire vocabulary words in the short term as well as over a long period of time.
Combining both approaches is best, but if you’re pressed for time, focus on short-term mem-
orization and test-taking skills.
Reading your way to a larger vocabulary
In a world of DVDs, video games, and 17 billion channels on TV, the pastime of reading for
enjoyment is quickly fading. To build your vocabulary, you have to read — it’s that simple.
Studies consistently show that those who read for enjoyment have a much larger vocabulary
than those who dislike reading. You have to see the words in print, not just hear someone
say them. Besides, people can read and understand many more words than they could ever
use in conversation.
39
Chapter 4: Word Knowledge

That doesn’t mean you have to start with Advanced Astrophysics. In fact, if you don’t read
much, you can start with your daily newspaper, a news magazine, or any type of reading
material that’s just a notch or two above what you ordinarily read. Choose topics that inter-
est you. If you’re interested in the subject matter, you’ll enjoy reading more. Plus, you may
just learn something new!
When you encounter a word you don’t know, try to understand what it means by the context
in which the word is used. For example, if you read, “The scientist extrapolated from the
data,” and you don’t know what extrapolated means, you can try substituting words you do
know to see if they would make sense. For example, the scientist probably didn’t hide from
the data. She probably used the data to make some sort of decision, judgment, or guess. To
confirm your understanding of the word, check your dictionary. You may even consider
keeping a running list of terms you come across as you read, along with their definitions 
(see the following section).
On the Word Knowledge section of the ASVAB, you often won’t be able to guess what a word
means from its context (because in many cases, there’s no context in the test because the
words aren’t used in sentences). You also won’t be able to look the word up in the dictionary.
But considering context and consulting a dictionary are two great ways to discover vocabu-
lary words during your test preparation.
Keeping a list and checking it twice
Not long ago, an 11-year-old girl went through the entire dictionary and made a list of all the
words she didn’t know. (The process took several months.) She then studied the list faith-
fully for a year and went on to win first place in the National Spelling Bee finales. You don’t
have to go to this extent, but even putting in a tenth of her effort can dramatically improve
your scores on the Word Knowledge subtest.
One way to improve your vocabulary is to keep a word list similar to the girl’s in the preced-
ing example. Here’s how that list works:
1. When you hear or read a word that you don’t understand, jot it down.
2. When you have a chance, look the word up in the dictionary and then write the
meaning down on your list.
3. Use the word in a sentence that you make up.
Write the sentence down, too.
4. Use your new words in everyday conversation.
Finding a way to work the word zenith into a description of last night’s basketball game
requires creativity, but you won’t forget what the word means.
Arrange your list by related items so that the words are easier to remember. For example, list
the words having to do with your work on one page, words related to mechanical knowledge
on another page, and so on.
If you’re looking for a few good resources to help you with vocabulary, check out these
sources:
 Internet keyword searches: You can also find Web sites that offer lists of words if you
spend a few minutes surfing. Try using search phrases, such as vocabulary words and
SAT words.
 www.freevocabulary.com: Free Vocabulary offers a free list of over 5,000 collegiate
words, along with brief definitions.

and word of the day.
 www.m-w.com: Merriam Webster online is another useful site with a free online diction-
ary, thesaurus, and word of the day.
 Books: A ton of books exist to help build your vocabulary. Try these two on for size:
• Vocabulary For Dummies by Laurie E. Rozakis (Wiley)
• SAT Vocabulary For Dummies by Suzee Vlk (Wiley)
These books are great resources designed to help you improve your word knowl-
edge skills.
Sounding off by sounding it out
Sometimes you actually know a word because you’ve heard it in conversation, but you don’t
recognize it when you see it written down. For instance, the word subtle (pronounced suh-tle)
could confuse anyone encountering it in writing for the first time. A student who’d heard the
word placebo (pronounced plah-see-bow) knew that it meant an inactive substance, like a
sugar pill. But, when she came across it in writing, she didn’t recognize it. She thought it was
a word pronounced “plah-chee-bow,” which she had never heard before.
So when you see a word on the ASVAB that you don’t recognize, try pronouncing it (not out
loud, please) a couple of different ways. The following pronunciation rules can help you out:
 Sometimes sounds are silent (like the b in subtle or the k in knight). Often, a letter at the
end of a word is silent. For instance, coup is pronounced coo.
 Some sounds have unusual pronunciations in certain contexts. Think of the l in colonel,
which is pronounced like kernel.
 C can sound like s or k and sometimes like ch (especially if two Cs are in a row).
 The letter i after a t can form a sound like she. Think of the word initiate.
 X can be pronounced like z, and it’s sometimes silent.
 A vowel at the end of a word can change the pronunciation of letters in the word. The
word wag has a different g sound than the word wage.
 When several vowels are right next to each other, they can be pronounced many differ-
ent ways (consider boo, boa, and bout). Try a couple of different possibilities. For
instance, if you see the word feint, you may think that it should be pronounced feent or
fiynt, but in fact, it sounds like faint. It means fake or pretend.

A
ny other organization would call this section of the ASVAB the Reading Compre-
hension subtest, but the Department of Defense is a stickler for precision. You’ll be
reading paragraphs, darn it, so you’re being tested on how well you understand paragraphs!
Not words, not sentences, not essays, but paragraphs! Don’t you just love the military way?
One thing you get from military boot camp is comprehending the drill sergeant’s orders and
the information in your instruction manuals are important. The ability to read and under-
stand the written directions in your basic training manual can save you and your buddies
hundreds of pushups. Trust us on this one. The Paragraph Comprehension subtest measures
your ability to understand what you read and to draw conclusions from that material. It con-
tains a number of reading passages and questions about those passages.
After you enlist, you discover that the military runs on paperwork. If you can’t read and
understand a regulation that’s buried within a pile of papers, how are you going to obey it?
The Importance of Paragraph Comprehension
for Military Jobs
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest is an important part of your AFQT score — the most
important score because it determines whether a particular branch of service lets you join.
The score is so important that we plan to keep on repeating it until you’re mumbling, “The
AFQT is the most important score,” in your sleep.
You would be surprised at how many diverse military jobs require a decent score on the
Paragraph Comprehension subtest. But, think about it for a moment. If the directions in a mil-
itary recipe make you rub your eyes and mumble to yourself, how are you going to cook a
meal for 2,000 troops? (Assuming you want to become a military cook, that is.) Table 5-1
shows the military job qualification line scores that are calculated by using your Paragraph
Comprehension subtest score.

Eyeing the Physique of the Paragraph
Comprehension Subtest
When you get to the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, you have several passages to read.
Most passages are only one paragraph long, and rarely are they longer than two paragraphs.
Each passage contains between 50 and 200 words. Look at it this way: At least you won’t be
required to read War and Peace!
The ASVAB test makers may ask you to answer only one question about a given reading pas-
sage, or they may ask you to answer as many as five questions about one passage.
Unfortunately, this subtest doesn’t consist of the most interesting passages you’ll ever read.
(You won’t find paragraphs from your favorite spy or romance novel here.) So, it’s important
that you set your attention-span dial all the way to the maximum setting. You have 15 ques-
tions on this subtest and 13 minutes to read the passages and answer the questions.
The Four Flavors of Comprehension Questions
The Paragraph Comprehension questions on the ASVAB usually take one of four forms:
 Finding specific information
 Recognizing the main idea
 Determining word meaning in context
 Drawing an implication from a stated idea
Each type of question asks you to perform a different kind of analysis of the reading passage.
If a passage has more than one question associated with it, chances are each question falls
under a different category. The following sections spell out the differences between these
four types of questions.
44
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

Treasure hunt: Finding specific information
This type of question asks you to pick out (you guessed it) specific information from a pas-
sage. Sounds easy, right? Remember, in the military, the only easy day was yesterday. At
times, the information that a question asks about isn’t directly stated in the paragraph, but
you can infer this information from the text. To figure out what this means, first take a look at
the following passage that clearly states the answer to the question that directly follows it:
An industry trade association found that more than 13,000 martial-arts schools exist in the
United States with nearly 6 million active members. Of the 13,000 schools, nearly 7,000
offered tae kwon do lessons.
According to this passage, how many people actively participated in martial arts lessons?
(A) 13,000
(B) 7,000
(C) 6 million
(D) It can’t be determined.
The correct answer is Choice (C).
Now, consider the next question, applied to the same passage:
According to this passage, how many schools didn’t teach tae kwon do?
(A) 13,000
(B) more than half
(C) 6 million
(D) 6,000
The correct answer is Choice (D). Although the passage doesn’t specifically state, “6,000
schools didn’t teach tae kwon do,” you can infer this information from the fact that 7,000
schools did teach tae kwon do. The remaining schools (of the 13,000 that offered martial
arts) must, logically, not have offered tae kwon do.
When questions are phrased in the negative, like the one above, you may be easily confused
about what the question is asking. (This fact is especially true when the information being
sought isn’t directly stated in the passage.) Misreading a negative question is also easy.
Research has shown that people often skip over a negative when they read. A reader could
easily glance at the above question and read “How many schools did teach tae kwon do?”
and that mistake leads to the wrong answer.
Be aware that questions on this portion of the ASVAB are frequently stated in the negative.
When you see one, an alarm should go off in your head that reminds you to read the question
more carefully.
Cutting to the chase: Recognizing the main idea
Sometimes the Paragraph Comprehension questions ask you to identify the main point of a
passage. The main point can be directly stated, or it can be implied. You can find the main
idea in the first sentence of the passage, and sometimes it pops up in the last sentence. So if
45
Chapter 5: Paragraph Comprehension

you’re not sure what the main point of a paragraph is, reread the first sentence and the last
sentence. Chances are one of these two sentences contains the main point. (Flip to “What’s
the Big Idea? Determining the Main Idea in a Paragraph” later in this chapter for more infor-
mation on identifying main ideas.)
If the shoe fits: Determining 
word meaning in context
Sometimes the Paragraph Comprehension subtest asks you to determine the meaning of a
word when it’s used in a passage. The correct definition that the question is looking for can
be the most common meaning of the word, or it can be a less well-known meaning of the
word.
In either case, you have to read the passage, make sure you understand how the word is
being used, and select the answer option that’s closest in meaning to the word as it’s used in
the passage. Consider this example:
In the 18th century, it was common for sailors to be pressed into service in Britain. Young
men found near seaports could be kidnapped, drugged, or otherwise hauled aboard a ship
and made to work doing menial chores. They weren’t paid for their service, and they were
given just enough food to keep them alive.
In this passage, pressed means:
(A) hired
(B) ironed
(C) enticed
(D) forced
The descriptions of the conditions these sailors found themselves in should help you decide
that they weren’t hired or enticed; ironed is one meaning of the word pressed, but it isn’t cor-
rect in this context. The correct answer is Choice (D).
Since the 1980s, computers have become an indispensable part of American business.
Computers can be used for thousands of applications from word processing and running
spreadsheets to keeping one’s checkbook updated.
In this passage, applications means:
(A) functions
(B) sizes
(C) requests
(D) types
Try putting the answer choices in this phrase: “Computers can be used for thousands of
applications.” You can see that functions is closest in meaning to applications, although in a
different context, some of the other answer choices may be correct. So the correct answer is
Choice (A).
46
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

Reading between the lines: 
Drawing an implication
You’re also asked to draw an implication from a stated idea. This simply means that you may
be asked to draw a conclusion about what you’ve read. This conclusion should always be
based on the reading, not your own particular opinions about a subject.
The conclusion — which may be called an inference or implication — must be reasonably
based on what the passage says. You have to use good judgment when deciding what conclu-
sions can be logically drawn from what you’ve read. Give it a shot:
Twenty-five percent of all automobile thefts occur when the doors of a car are left unlocked.
People often forget to lock their doors, find it inconvenient, or tell themselves, “I’ll only be a
minute.” But it only takes a minute for an accomplished car thief to steal a car. And thieves
are always alert to the opportunities that distracted or rushed people present them with.
To prevent auto theft, it’s a person’s responsibility to:
(A) leave the doors unlocked
(B) never be in a rush
(C) prevent the opportunity
(D) be willing to perform a citizen’s arrest
Although the paragraph doesn’t state, “To prevent auto theft, it’s a person’s responsibility to
prevent the opportunity,” this idea is certainly implied. The correct answer is Choice (C).
There’s no implication that people should be willing to (or can) perform a citizen’s arrest.
Leaving the doors unlocked is the opposite of what one should do, and never being in a rush
is probably impossible.
An example of an unreasonable conclusion drawn from the above paragraph would be some-
thing like, “If everyone locked their doors, there would be no crime,” or “All car thieves
should be sentenced to 30 years in prison.” Nothing in this particular passage supports such
a conclusion.
One way to help determine if you’ve drawn a reasonable conclusion is to ask yourself,
“Based on what I’ve just read, would the author agree with the conclusion I’ve reached?” If
the answer is yes, your conclusion is probably reasonable. If the answer is no, it’s time to
think up a new conclusion.
Boiler technicians operate main and auxiliary boilers. They maintain and repair all parts,
including pressure fittings, valves, pumps, and forced-air blowers. Technicians may have to lift
or move heavy equipment. They may have to stoop and kneel and work in awkward positions.
According to this job description, a good candidate for this job would be:
(A) a person with joint problems
(B) an individual unaccustomed to heavy lifting
(C) a person who isn’t mechanically minded
(D) a person who’s physically fit
Although the passage doesn’t state, “This job requires a physically fit person,” the duties
listed imply that this is so. The correct answer is (D). A person with joint problems may not
be able to stoop or kneel or work in awkward positions. A person who’s unaccustomed to
47
Chapter 5: Paragraph Comprehension

heavy lifting may not be able to lift or move the heavy equipment as needed. A person who
isn’t mechanically minded may not have the knowledge necessary to maintain and repair
boilers and all their parts. This leaves Choice (D) as the answer, and it’s true that a person
who’s physically fit would be a good choice for the job.
What’s the Big Idea? Determining
the Main Idea in a Paragraph
In order to understand what you read — which is what the Paragraph Comprehension sub-
test is all about — you need to develop several abilities:
 Finding the main idea or argument that the author is making
 Remembering specific details about the reading
 Drawing conclusions from what you’ve read
 Understanding relationships between ideas
 Paraphrasing (or summarizing) what you’ve read
Do you get my point?
Questions on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest frequently ask you to identify the main
point of a reading passage. How do you get better at identifying main ideas? Practice. The
main idea, which is the most important point the author is making, is sometimes stated and
sometimes implied in a piece of writing. Often, the author begins or ends a paragraph or pas-
sage with the main idea, which is located in what’s called a topic sentence. A topic sentence,
reasonably enough, describes the topic that the author’s writing about.
So, if you’re looking for the main idea, start off by checking the first and last sentence of the
passage. (No, this doesn’t mean that you should skip the rest of the passage.) For example,
suppose you read the following paragraph:
The local school district is facing a serious budgetary crisis. The state, suffering a rev-
enue shortfall of more than $600 million, has cut funding to the district by $18.7 million.
Already, 65 teachers have been laid off, and more layoffs are expected.
No, the primary theme of this passage isn’t “schools in our area suck.” The main point of this
paragraph can be found in the opening sentence, “The local school district is facing a serious
budgetary crisis.” What follows are details regarding the budget crisis.
Sometimes, a passage builds up to its main idea, and sometimes the main idea is implied,
instead of stated. Consider the following paragraph:
The farmers’ market reopened on the second weekend of May. Amid the asparagus and
flowers, shoppers chatted about the return of temperatures in the 70s. Across the street,
children (and their dogs) played Frisbee in the park. Finally, spring has come to town.
In this paragraph, you may think that the farmers’ market reopening is the main point, but
the other information about the temperature and the kids playing Frisbee tells you that the
main idea is something a bit broader than the market opening. The main idea is stated in the
last sentence: “Finally, spring has come to town.”
48
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

In boot camp, your drill instructor may say, “Some of you better check to see that your bunks
are properly made.” Or he may rip your bunk bed apart and say, “Now make this $%*& bunk
the right way, you moron!” Both comments mean the same thing. In the first statement, the
drill instructor implies the meaning; the second statement is a bit more direct.
Extra, extra! Identifying subpoints
If a writer stuck to just one point, the Paragraph Comprehension subtest would be a breeze.
However, an author usually doesn’t just make one point in a piece of writing, so you also
need to understand the other points the author makes. These details, or subpoints, may
include facts or statistics, or they may be descriptions that support the main point of the
passage. Subpoints help you see what the author’s saying.
For instance, look at this passage (from the previous section):
The local school district is facing a serious budgetary crisis. The state, suffering a rev-
enue shortfall of more than $600 million, has cut funding to the district by $18.7 million.
Already, 65 teachers have been laid off, and more layoffs are expected.
The subpoints help you understand the main point — the school district is facing a severe
budgetary crisis. The subpoints help you understand why: “The state, suffering a revenue
shortfall of more than $600 million, has cut funding to the district by $18.7 million.” You can
see that the budgetary crisis is part of a larger problem, which is the state suffering a severe
revenue shortfall. The subpoints also help you understand what this crisis means: “Already,
65 teachers have been laid off, and more layoffs are expected.” By using these facts and fig-
ures, the author helps you grasp not only the main point but also the implications of that
main point.
Word Psychology: Analyzing What You’ve Read
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest of the ASVAB also requires you to analyze what
you’ve read. Analysis is more than simply picking out the point of text. Analyzing a passage
requires you to draw conclusions from what you’ve read and understand relationships
between the ideas presented in the text. To analyze a passage, you may need to put it into
your own words by paraphrasing it.
Say what? Determining the 
meaning of word passages
By drawing conclusions about the meaning of a passage, you reach new ideas that the author
implies but doesn’t come right out and state. You must analyze the information the author
presents in order to make inferences from what you’ve read.
For instance, look at the following paragraph:
The local school district is facing a serious budgetary crisis. The state, suffering a rev-
enue shortfall of more than $600 million, has cut funding to the district by $18.7 million.
Already, 65 teachers have been laid off, and more layoffs are expected.
49
Chapter 5: Paragraph Comprehension

Although the author doesn’t say so, you can draw the conclusion that if the state revenue
shortfall could somehow be corrected — by increasing state sales tax or income tax, for
example — the local school district’s budgetary crisis could be resolved. (The $18.7 million
cut from the school budget could be restored.) The author never actually makes this point in
the paragraph. But by using reason and logic, you can draw this conclusion from the facts
presented.
Making inferences and drawing conclusions requires you to use your judgment. You don’t
want to read too much into a passage. For example, nothing in the above paragraph suggests
that electing a new governor is necessary or that increasing federal income taxes would help
the problem.
Look at the next paragraph:
The farmers’ market reopened on the second weekend of May. Amid the asparagus and
flowers, shoppers chatted about the return of temperatures in the 70s. Across the street,
children (and their dogs) played Frisbee in the park. Finally, spring has come to town.
Suppose you were asked the following question about this paragraph:
It can be inferred from the passage that:
(A) Frisbee playing in the park doesn’t happen in winter.
(B) The warm weather is unusual for this time of year.
(C) The shoppers were disappointed in the farmers’ market produce.
(D) Rain is imminent.
If the point of the passage is that spring has come to town, and the author uses Frisbee play-
ing as evidence of the arrival of spring, then it’s likely that Frisbee playing doesn’t occur in
the winter but does begin again in spring. The answer is Choice (A).
In other words: Rephrasing passages
One of the best ways to identify the main point of a paragraph is to put the paragraph into
your own words (paraphrase it) or to sum up the basic idea of the paragraph (summarize it).
By quickly doing this when you take the Paragraph Comprehension portion of the ASVAB,
you can be confident that you’re answering the question correctly. In other words (to para-
phrase), you’ll know you know what the paragraph is talking about.
You won’t have time to write down the main point or to jot down your paraphrase or sum-
mary. Instead, as you’re reading, simply try to mentally keep track of what’s being said by
putting it into your own words.
As you study for the ASVAB, practice paraphrasing reading passages. Read different passages
from a book or magazine and then close the pages and get out a pencil and jot down your
paraphrases. (Remember, you won’t have time to do this on the ASVAB test itself, but the
practice helps you mentally prepare for when you take the test.)
Look at the following paragraph. (This is the last time you see this paragraph in this chapter.
We promise.)
The local school district is facing a serious budgetary crisis. The state, suffering a rev-
enue shortfall of more than $600 million, has cut funding to the district by $18.7 million.
Already, 65 teachers have been laid off, and more layoffs are expected.
50
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

Now, close this book and spend a few moments paraphrasing the previous paragraph. Come
on. Pick up that pencil, and get those brain cells pumping. When you’re done, reopen to this
page and compare your ideas to the passage. If you wrote something like the following,
you’re right on track:
The school district has a budget crunch because the state has a budget crunch. The
state cut funding to the school district. Some teachers have been laid off already. More
may be laid off soon.
You can practice this technique as you study for the ASVAB. You can paraphrase or summa-
rize any short passage you read — a few sentences or a paragraph or two.
Now if you wrote something like, “It’s finally May, and shoppers and kids-at-play are out and
about, enjoying the warmer temperatures of spring,” then you’re not paying attention. Turn
off the TV and give it another try.
Faster than a Speeding Turtle: 
Tips for Slow Readers
Today’s military is much more complex than attending boot camp, learning how to shoot a
gun, and shipping off to war. After boot camp, you attend intensive classroom training to
learn your military job. If you can’t read well, you’re going to have a very hard time. But the
good news is that it’s never too late to work on improving your reading skills.
For many people, 13 minutes is enough time to read all the passages, understand the 15
questions, and choose the correct answers. But slow readers may have more difficulty get-
ting all the questions answered before time is up. Don’t despair: Take the suggestions in this
section to help you build your reading speed. Of course, they require work, but you knew the
mission came with its challenges, right?
Read more, watch less
If you’re a slow reader, chances are you don’t do a lot of reading. If you have plenty of time
before you’re due to take the ASVAB, start reading more — right now — it’s in your best
interest.
You don’t have to pick up A Tale of Two Cities or War and Peace; you can start with the news-
paper, a biography of a person you admire, or magazines you find at the library. Sorry, but
the instruction guide to your favorite video game doesn’t count. You don’t need to enroll in a
speed-reading course. If you devote at least one hour a day to simply reading, you’ll see your
reading comprehension and speed increase within a month or so.
Several studies have shown that folks who enjoy reading as a pleasurable pastime score
better on reading comprehension tests than individuals who dislike reading. Sounds obvious,
right? So why study it? The idea is if you grow to enjoy reading, you’ll become a better reader
automatically and thereby score better on reading comprehension tests. How do you dis-
cover an enjoyment of reading? Simple — choose reading material in subject areas that 
interest you.
51
Chapter 5: Paragraph Comprehension

Become a lean, mean word machine
People sometimes read slowly because they don’t have a large vocabulary and don’t under-
stand everything they read. If you can identify with this situation, improving your vocabulary
is your first step toward increasing your reading comprehension and your reading speed.
(Chapter 4 gives you info on building your word knowledge. Check it out.)
Keep a pocket dictionary handy while reading, so you can look up words you don’t know. If
you’re reading articles on the Internet, keep a window open to one of the online dictionaries
(such as www.dictionary.com to www.m-w.com), so you can quickly find the definition of
words you find confusing. Your reading will become more enjoyable, and you’ll be adding to
your vocabulary knowledge to boot.
Build your confidence
Another reason people read slowly is that they don’t have confidence in themselves. They’re
not convinced that they understand what they’re reading, so they read a passage several
times, trying to make sure they haven’t missed anything. But just like people who check that
the front door is locked 15 times before leaving for vacation and still lie awake at night won-
dering if they locked the door, reading and rereading a passage doesn’t give you confidence
that you understand the text. You get confidence from proving that you understand it.
How do you prove to yourself that you understand what you’re reading? Here are a couple 
of tips:
 Get out a textbook or even an encyclopedia (preferably a volume that contains some
subject matter that interests you) and read one or two paragraphs straight through
without going back and rereading anything. Then close the book (keeping your place
marked) and write, in your own words, a brief description of what you’ve read. Finally,
turn back to the passage and compare your description to the information on the page.
 Play the 20-questions game. Read an article from a magazine, encyclopedia, or text-
book. Then ask someone to pick out facts from the article and ask you questions.
 Create motivation and interest by reading the daily newspaper or news magazines.
Discuss the news events with your classmates, friends, or co-workers. Stronger interest
equals greater comprehension.
Is your written version of the article close in meaning to the original? Do you get most of the
20 questions correct? Do you feel comfortable discussing current events with others? If so,
you understand what you’re reading, and that should build your confidence. If not, don’t toss
the book or magazine aside in frustration or go ballistic on your mom for asking you tough
questions. Keep working on it and your comprehension will improve. Do the above confi-
dence-building drills a few times a day until you feel like you can read any paragraph or two
and understand the content without having to reread the information.
The Paragraph Comprehension section tests your ability to understand what you read, not
how quickly you can read it. When you sit down to take this subtest, try to go as quickly as
you can without sacrificing accuracy. Being methodical in your reading isn’t a bad thing as
long as you’re getting the answers right. Just try to read a little faster than normal without
panicking or missing the point.
It’s better to read the paragraphs carefully and answer the questions correctly on half of the
questions and guess on the other half of the questions than it is to speed through all the
reading and get none of the answers right.

Test-Taking Tips for Reading and Gleaning
Although no shortcuts exist to improving your reading comprehension skills (besides prac-
tice), you can do a few things on test day to make sure that you score as high as possible on
this part of the ASVAB.
If you’re running out of time on this subtest, or you’re not sure if you can identify the main
idea of a passage, take a guess. If you think that’s a good piece of advice, check out these
tried-and-true tactics for test day:
 Read first, ask questions later. Read the passage all the way through before glancing at
the question and answer options.
 Take it one question at a time. Some passages have more than one question associ-
ated with them, but look at only one question at a time.
 Understand each question. What’s the question asking you to do? Are you supposed to
find the main point? Draw a conclusion? Find a word that’s nearest in meaning? Make
sure you know what the question asks before you choose among the answer options.
This tip may seem obvious, but when you’re in a hurry, you can make mistakes by mis-
understanding the questions.
 Read each answer option carefully. Don’t just select the first answer that seems right.
Remember, on the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, one answer is often most right
while others are almost right. You want to choose the most right answer, not the almost
right answer. And to do that, you have to read all the answers.
 Check your feelings at the door. Answer each question based on the passage, not your
own opinions or views on the topic.
 Don’t choose vague answer options. They’re incorrect 99.99 times out of 100. (Oh
heck, call it 100 times out of 100.) If an answer strikes you as not quite true but not
totally false, that answer is incorrect. Those nasty ASVAB test makers have put those
answers in there to throw you off. Don’t give them the satisfaction of falling for their
trap!
 Never select never. For the most part, answer options that are absolute are incorrect.
Never, always, and related words are often a sign that you should select a different
answer. Words like generally and usually are more likely to be correct.

o help you hone your communication skills a little further, this chapter contains some
Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension practice questions to get you rolling.
Don’t sweat, this test is just for practice and doesn’t count for a score. (Plus, sweating
makes your answer sheet soggy and makes it harder to mark on).
The communications subtests of the ASVAB are very important as they comprise a signifi-
cant portion of your AFQT score. (We promised we’d keep pounding this concept into your
head — and we wouldn’t lie to you, ever!)
On the ASVAB (and on the full-length practice tests later in this book), you see 35 Word
Knowledge questions and 15 questions about paragraph comprehension. But in this chap-
ter, you get 25 total questions just to help you warm up for the practice tests later on in 
this book.
Word Knowledge Practice Questions
In the stem of each of the following Word Knowledge practice questions, you see an 
underlined word. Select the choice that best answers the question in relation to the under-
lined word.
Pay attention to the wording of each question. Some questions ask you to select the choice
closest in meaning to the underlined word. Some questions may ask you to select the word
most opposite in meaning. On other questions you see the underlined word used in a sen-
tence. In that case, your task is to select the choice most similar in meaning to the underlined
word as it is used in the context of the sentence.
1. Community most nearly means:
(A) society
(B) money
(C) date
(D) bank

Community means state or commonwealth, so the correct answer is (A). The other choices
are unrelated.
2. She thought that there was a conspiracy against her.
(A) wall
(B) plan
(C) evil deed
(D) ghost
Conspiracy means plot, so the correct answer is (B). Choices (A) and (D) are unrelated, and
although a conspiracy may be an evil deed, (C) isn’t as close in meaning as (B).
3. Keen most nearly means:
(A) sharp
(B) small
(C) simple
(D) shiny
Keen means having a fine edge, so the correct answer is Choice (A). Choices (B), (C), and (D)
are unrelated.
4. Defer most nearly means:
(A) change
(B) reverse
(C) deny
(D) postpone
Defer means to put off, so the correct answer is Choice (D). Choices (A), (B), and (C) are 
unrelated.
5. The mother chastised her child.
(A) comforted
(B) carried
(C) lectured
(D) supervised
Chastised means disciplined or punished, so Choice (C) is the most correct choice. Choices
(A), (B), and (D) are unrelated.
6. Obtrude most nearly means:
(A) condition

Paragraph Comprehension Practice Questions
The last half of the questions in this chapter are designed to present you with an opportunity
to practice your paragraph comprehension skills. Read the short paragraph, followed by one
or more questions regarding information contained in that passage. Make sure to read the
paragraph carefully before selecting the choice that most correctly answers the question.
Passage one
Although the average consumer replaces the tires on his or her automobile every 50,000
miles, steel-belted radials can last for more than 60,000 miles. However, they must be prop-
erly maintained. The tires must be inflated to the correct air pressure at all times, and tires
must be rotated and balanced according to a routine maintenance schedule. The tread
should be checked for correct depth regularly.
14. How long can steel-belted radials last?
(A) 50,000 miles
(B) 60,000 miles
(C) No one knows.
(D) 25,000 miles
The correct answer is Choice (B). If you missed this one, read the passage more carefully.
58
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

15. According to the passage above, proper tire maintenance doesn’t include:
(A) keeping tires properly inflated
(B) balancing and rotating tires
(C) checking the tread
(D) checking the lug nuts
This question is negative and requires extra care in answering — meaning, you have to figure
out what proper tire maintenance does include so you can eliminate those answers before
you select the correct answer. Choice (D) is the correct answer.
Passage two
Some people argue that baking is an art, but Chef Debra Dearhorn says that baking is a sci-
ence. She says that if you follow a recipe carefully, assembling the ingredients accurately,
cooking at the specified temperature for the specified period of time, your cookies will
always turn out right. Chef Dearborn says the best baking is like the best experiment —
anyone can duplicate it.
16. In this passage, the word assembling most nearly means:
(A) measuring
(B) putting together
(C) buying
(D) storing
Although measuring is something you do when baking, it doesn’t most nearly mean the same
thing as assembling. Putting together does. Therefore, Choice (B) is the correct answer.
17. According to the above passage, a person who’s all thumbs in the kitchen:
(A) should get out of the kitchen
(B) is an artist
(C) isn’t following the recipe carefully
(D) is Chef Dearborn
The passage states that if you follow a recipe carefully, your cookies will always turn out
right. The correct answer is Choice (C).
Passage three
The United States Postal Service delivers a one-pound package overnight for $20, although it
doesn’t guarantee on-time arrival. UPS delivers the same package for $25 and guarantees the
delivery. FedEx delivers the package for $30 and guarantees the delivery and picks up your
package for no additional charge.
59
Chapter 6: All’s Well That Tests Well: Communication Practice Questions

18. Which service should you use if you must have a delivery guarantee but can’t spend more
than $25?
(A) United States Postal Service
(B) United Parcel Service
(C) FedEx
(D) None of the services meet the criteria.
The passage’s second sentence tells you everything you need to know. The correct answer is
Choice (B).
Passage four
To motivate your people, give them tasks that challenge them. Get to know your people and
their capabilities, so you can tell just how far to push each one. Give them as much responsi-
bility as they can handle and then let them do the work without looking over their shoulders
and nagging them. When they succeed, praise them. When they fall short, give them credit
for what they’ve done and coach or counsel them on how to do better next time.
19. According to the above paragraph, if your subordinates fail to adequately perform their
tasks, you should:
(A) punish them
(B) praise them
(C) counsel them
(D) both B and C
The last sentence states you should give your subordinates credit for the parts of the task
they performed correctly and counsel them how to do better the next time. The correct
answer is Choice (D).
20. After assigning responsibility for the tasks at hand to your subordinates, you should:
(A) supervise closely to ensure the tasks are performed correctly
(B) let them do the work on their own
(C) check their progress at the end of each day
(D) schedule sufficient work-breaks to avoid job burnout
Choices (C) and (D) sound like good ideas, but they aren’t suggestions discussed by the
topic paragraph. Remember to avoid the trap of answering based on your own personal feel-
ings. Choice (B) is the correct answer.
Passage five
Approximately 15,000 years ago the first Native Americans may have appeared in Colorado.
The earliest inhabitants were hunters and nomadic foragers on the plains, as well as the
western plateau. Agricultural settlements began appearing along river valleys in the eastern
part of Colorado from approximately 5,000 B.C. as people learned farming techniques from
the Mississippi River Native Americans.
60
Part II: Words to Live By: Communication Skills 

21. The first Native Americans in Colorado were:
(A) farmers
(B) traders
(C) hunters and scavengers
(D) originally from the Mississippi River region
The second sentence states that the original inhabitants were hunters and nomadic foragers,
and because none of the other answer options include hunters, you can deduce that nomadic
foragers means scavengers. The correct answer is Choice (C).
Passage six
Organizational leaders influence several hundred to several thousand people. They 
do this indirectly, generally through more levels of subordinates than do direct leaders. 
The additional levels of subordinates can make it more difficult for them to see results.
Organizational leaders have staffs to help them lead their people and manage their organiza-
tions’ resources. They establish policies and the organizational climate that support their
subordinate leaders.
22. Organizational leaders provide:
(A) direct leadership
(B) general policies
(C) organizational budgets
(D) daily work schedules
According to the passage, organizational leaders establish policies and the organizational cli-
mate that support their subordinate leaders. The correct answer is Choice (B).
23. In order to help them become more efficient, organization leaders make significant use of:
(A) computer technology
(B) rules and regulations
(C) efficiency and management reports
(D) staffs
Organizational leaders have staffs to help them efficiently lead their subordinates and
manage the organization. Therefore, Choice (D) is the correct answer.
Passage seven
His name is Frank Clarke, but his real name isn’t really as real as the one the children gave
him — The Toyman — because he’s always making the kids things, such as kites and tops,
sleds and boats, jokes and happiness and laughter. His face is as brown as saddle leather,
with a touch of apple red in it from the sun. His face is creased, too, because he laughs and
jokes so much. Sometimes when The Toyman appears to be solemn you want to laugh most,
for he’s only pretending to be solemn. And, best of all, if you hurt yourself or if your pet
doggie hurts himself, The Toyman knows how to fix it to make it all well again.
61
Chapter 6: All’s Well That Tests Well: Communication Practice Questions

24. Frank Clarke’s face could best be described as:
(A) rugged
(B) pink and smooth
(C) fair
(D) feminine
According to the passage, Frank’s face was brown as saddle leather, and he had creases from
laughing often. Choice (A) is the correct answer.
25. Clarke received his nickname because he was always:
(A) fixing toys
(B) making toys for the children
(C) telling stories about toys
(D) playing with toys
The first sentence in the passage explains why the children gave Frank the nickname of The
Toyman. The correct answer is Choice (B).

any military careers require a solid understanding
of math principles. Even though the military will
spring for a calculator, you’re expected to know how to
add and subtract before you hit boot camp. And you can’t
use a calculator on the ASVAB.
Part III gives you a chance to brush up on your numbers
knowledge. It includes all kinds of information that can help
you do well on the two math-related subtests the ASVAB
throws at you: Arithmetic Reasoning and Mathematics
Knowledge. We also give you a ton of tips on everything
from how to guess if you’re running out of time to what to
do if you forget how to solve a quadratic equation.

Chapter 7
Arithmetic Reasoning
In This Chapter
 Solving life’s little (math) problems
 Reviewing essential basic math
 Multiplying your chances for a better score
H
ow many miles-per-gallon does your brand-new SUV get? How long does it take to go
over the river and through the woods to Grandmother’s house? How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck? These are examples of common everyday questions that can be
answered by arithmetic reasoning. (Okay, maybe the woodchuck situation doesn’t happen
everyday.)
Arithmetic Reasoning is the ASVAB way of saying word problems. Word problems help you
apply mathematical principles to the real world (at least the real world according to the
people who think up word problems). And the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest measures your
ability to do real-life, basic, mathematical calculations derived from simple word problems. 
If you slept through high-school math, don’t worry. This chapter helps you decipher these
mathematical equations.
The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest asks you to read a word problem, determine what the
question asks, and select the correct answer. (Then you have to repeat the process 29 more
times.)
The test administrator should supply you with scratch paper and a trusty number two 
pencil — one thing they won’t give you (or even let you bring) is a calculator. You can use
your paper and lead to clarify the data, write formulas, and mathematically solve the prob-
lem. You can even use them to draw pretty pictures to help you understand the problem.
Don’t get too artistic, though — you only have 36 minutes to answer 30 questions. That
comes out to only 1 minute and 12 seconds per question.
Arithmetic Reasoning is an important part of the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)
score, which is used to determine your general qualification for enlistment in all the service
branches. (See Chapter 1 for more information.) Also, certain military jobs require that you
score well on this subtest. Turn to the Appendix to find out which jobs require what scores
on this subtest.
In order to do well on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest, you have to remember that there
are two parts: arithmetic and reasoning. You usually have to use both of these skills for each
problem. The arithmetic part comes in when you have to perform mathematical operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The reasoning comes in when you
figure out what numbers to use in your calculations. In other words, Arithmetic Reasoning
tests how you apply your ability to perform calculations to everyday, real-life problems.

The Real World of Word Problems
Test takers often waste a lot of time reading and rereading word problems as if the answer
might reveal itself to them by some miracle, which isn’t going to happen. Correctly solving
math word problems requires you to perform a series of organized steps:
1. Read the problem completely.
2. Figure out what the question is asking.
3. Dig out the relevant facts.
4. Set up one or more mathematical formulas to arrive at a solution and then solve the
problem.
5. Review your answer.
These steps are covered in detail throughout this section.
Don’t judge a word problem by its 
cover: Reading the entire problem
The first step in solving a word problem is reading the entire problem to discover what it’s 
all about. Try forming a picture about the problem in your mind or — better yet — draw a
sketch of the problem on your scratch paper.
Ask yourself if you’ve ever seen a problem like this before. If so, what’s similar about it, and
what did you do to solve it in the past?
As plain as the nose on a fly: Figuring 
out what the question is asking
The second and most important step in solving a word problem is to determine exactly 
what the question is asking. Sometimes the question is asked directly. At other times, it may
be a little more difficult to identify the actual question. Suppose you’re asked the following
question:
What’s the volume of a cardboard box measuring 12-inches long by 14-inches wide by 10-
inches tall?
(A) 52 cubic inches
(B) 88 cubic inches
(C) 120 cubic inches
(D) 1,680 cubic inches
The question asked by this word problem is stated directly. The problem asks you to deter-
mine the volume of a cardboard box. Recall from your high school algebra and geometry
classes that the volume of a rectangular container is length × width × height or v = lwh.
So 12 × 14 × 10 = 1,680. The correct answer is Choice (D).
66
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Now take a look at the next example:
How many cubic inches of sand does a cardboard box measuring 12-inches long by 14-inches
wide by 10-inches tall contain?
(A) 52 cubic inches
(B) 88 cubic inches
(C) 120 cubic inches
(D) 1,680 cubic inches
This is the same problem, but the question you need to answer isn’t as obviously stated.
Therefore, you have to use clues imbedded in the problem in order to figure out what the
actual question is. Would figuring out the perimeter of the box help you with this question?
Nope. Would figuring out the area of one side of the box help you? Nope (you’re not painting
the box, you’re filling it). The question wants you to determine the volume of the container.
Clue words can be a big help when trying to figure out what question is being asked. Look for
the following clue words:
 Addition: sum, total, in all, perimeter, increased by, combined, added
 Division: share, distribute, ratio, quotient, average, per, a, out of, percent
 Equals: is, was, are, were, amounts to
 Multiplication: product, total, area, cubic, times, multiplied by, of
 Subtraction: difference, how much more, exceed, less than, fewer than, decreased
Digging for the facts
After you figure out what question you’re answering in the first place (see the preceding sec-
tion), the next step is to figure out what data is necessary to solve the problem and what
data is extraneous. Start by identifying all the information and variables in the problem and
listing them on your scratch paper. Make sure you attach units of measurement contained in
the problem (mile, feet, inches, gallons, quarts, and so on).
After you’ve made a list of the facts, try to eliminate those facts that aren’t relevant to the
question. Look at the following example:
To raise money for the school yearbook project, Tom sold 15 candy bars. Becky sold 12
candy bars, Debbie sold 17 candy bars, and Jane sold the most at 50. How many candy bars
were sold by the girls?
The list of facts may look something like this:
Tom = 15 bars
Becky = 12 bars
Debbie = 17 bars
Jane = 50 bars
? = total sold by the girls
Because the question is the total number of candy bars sold by the girls, the number of bars
sold by Tom isn’t relevant to the problem and can be scratched off the list. Just add the
remaining bars from your list.
67
Chapter 7: Arithmetic Reasoning

Setting up the problem and working 
your way to the answer
You need to decide how the problem can be solved and then use your math skills to arrive at
a solution. For instance, a question may ask the following:
Joan just turned 37. For 12 years she’s dreamed of traveling to Key West to become a beach
bum. To finance this dream, she needs to save a total of $15,000. How much does Joan need
to save each year if she wants to become a beach bum by her 40th birthday?
Write down, in mathematical terms, what the question is asking you to determine. Because
the question is asking how much money Joan needs to save per year to reach $15,000, you
can say y (years Joan has to save) × m (money she needs to save each year) = $15,000. Or to
put it more mathematically:
ym = $15,000
You don’t know the value of m (yet) — that’s the unknown you’re asked to find. But you can
find out the value of y — the number of years Joan has to save. If she’s 37 and wants to be a
beach bum by the time she’s 40, she has 3 years to save. So now the formula looks like this:
3m = 15,000
To isolate the unknown on one side of the equation, you simply divide each side by 3, so 
that 3m ÷ 3 = 15,000 ÷ 3. (If you don’t remember how to isolate unknowns, flip on over to
Chapter 8.) Therefore, your answer is
m = 5,000
Joan needs to save $5,000 each year for 3 years to reach her goal of $15,000 by the time
she’s 40.
You may be tempted to include the 12 years Joan has been dreaming of this trip into your for-
mula. This number was put into the problem as a distracter. It has no bearing on solving the
problem. Tricky little questions, aren’t they?
Reviewing your answer
Before marking your answer sheet or punching in that choice on the computer, you should
review your answer to make sure it makes sense. Review by asking yourself the following
questions:
 Does your solution seem probable?
 Does it answer the question asked?
 Are you sure?
 Is your answer expressed using the same units of measurement as used in the problem?
You may find that the solution you arrived at doesn’t fit the facts presented in the problem. If
this is the case, back up and go through the steps again until you arrive at an answer that
seems probable.

Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Welcome Back to Basic (Math) Training
Numbers come in several varieties. Whole numbers are numbers such as 1, 2, 17, and 54.
Fractions, percents, and decimals are numbers used to represent a part of a whole number.
The following sections present some specific strategies you need to remember when you’re
crunching the numbers to figure out those menacing word problems.
Operations: What you do to numbers
When you toss numbers together (mathematically speaking), you perform an operation.
When you add or multiply, you perform a basic operation. But because math functions
according to yin-yang-like principles, each of these basic operations also has an opposite
operation called an inverse operation. Thus, the inverse of addition is subtraction, and the
inverse of multiplication is division. And, of course, the inverse of subtraction is — you got 
it — addition. The inverse of division (go on, you can do it) is multiplication. Great work!
Don’t confuse opposite with inverse. When you’re doing mathematical operations, such as
adding and multiplying, the inverse operation is the opposite operation. But when you’re
talking numbers, opposite and inverse don’t mean the same thing. The opposite of a positive
number is a negative number, so the opposite of x is -x. But the inverse of a number is that
number turned on its head! The inverse of x is 1⁄x. The inverse of 1⁄5 is 5⁄1 (or just 5).
The result of each operation goes by a different name:
 When you add two numbers together, you arrive at a sum.
 When you subtract, all that remains is a remainder.
 When you multiply, you come up with a product.
 When you divide, you’re left with a quotient.
When setting up formulas to solve word problems, you need to remember that operations
must be performed in a certain order. For example, when you have parentheses in a math
problem, the calculation in the parentheses must be done before any calculations outside of
the parentheses. In the equation 5 + (16 × 2) = ?, you first multiply 16 by 2 to arrive at 32, and
then you add the 5 to come up with a total of 37. You get a different (and wrong) answer if
you simply calculate from left to right: 5 + 16 = 21. 21 × 2 = 42. And you better believe that
both results will be choices on the test!
To figure out which mathematical operation you should perform first, second, third, and so
on, follow these rules, otherwise known as the order of operations:
1. Parentheses take precedence.
You should do everything contained in parentheses first. In cases where parentheses
are contained within parentheses, do the innermost parentheses first. If you’re dealing
with a fraction, treat the top as if it were in parentheses and the bottom as if it were in
parentheses even if the parentheses weren’t written in the original state.
So if you have the problem
Add the numbers above or to the left of the fraction bar and then divide. The answer 
is 3⁄3 = ?
1 + 2 =
3
?
69
Chapter 7: Arithmetic Reasoning

The square root sign (√) is also a grouping symbol, so you solve for the square root
before doing any other operation in the problem. (For more on fractions, see the next
section. And to get your fill of square roots, march on over to Chapter 8.)
2. Exponents come next.
Remember that the exponent goes with the number or variable that it’s closest to. If it
had been closest to a parenthesis sign, then you already would’ve performed the calcu-
lation inside the parenthesis. For example, (5 × 2)2 = 102 = 100.
The square root sign (√) is also treated as an exponent symbol, so you solve for the
square root during this step. (See Chapter 8.)
3. Multiplication and division are next.
You always do these operations in left-to-right order (just like you read).
4. Addition and subtraction are last.
Perform these operations from left to right as well.
Check out the following example for a little practice with order of operations:
(15 ÷ 5) × 3 + (18 – 7) = ?
Follow these steps:
1. Do the work in parenthesis.
The result is 3 × 3 + 11 = ?
2. Division and multiplication come next (in this problem, only multiplication is
needed and no exponent work is present).
You end with 9 + 11 = ?
3. Finally, do the addition and subtraction (in this problem, only addition is needed).
Your final answer is 20.
On both sides of the line: Fractions
We don’t know why, but it seems almost all math textbooks explain fractions in terms of pies.
(We think most mathematicians must have a sweet tooth.) But we like pizza, so we’re going
to use pizza instead.
If a whole number is a pizza, a fraction is a slice of pizza. A fraction also illustrates its relation-
ship to the whole pizza. For example, consider the fraction 3⁄5. If you accuse your cousin of
eating 3⁄5 of the pizza when he comes over for movie night, you’re saying that the pizza is
divided into five equal-sized slices — fifths — and your cousin ate three of those five slices.
Can anyone say pig?
The number above the fraction bar — the three slices your cousin ate — is called the numer-
ator. The number written below the fraction bar — the total number of slices the pizza is
divided into — is called the denominator.
Adding and subtracting fractions
To add and subtract fractions, the fractions must have the same denominator, which is called
a common denominator. If the fractions don’t have a common denominator, you have to find
one. There are two different methods to use. Sound fun? Read on.
70
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Method one
Finding a common denominator can be easy, or it can be as hard as picking off all the
anchovies. Suppose you want to add 3⁄5 and 3⁄10. This operation is an easy one, and you use 
this process whenever you can evenly divide one denominator by another. Follow the steps
below:
1. Divide the larger denominator by the smaller denominator.
If there’s a remainder, then you can’t use this method, and you have to use method two
(see the following section). In this case, 10 can be divided evenly by 5. The quotient
that results is 2.
2. Take the fraction with the smaller denominator (3⁄5) and multiply the denominator 
by 2 — the quotient that resulted when you divided the larger denominator by the
smaller.
The result is 10.
3. Replace the denominator of the smaller fraction with the result from Step 2.
4. Multiply the numerator of the smaller fraction by 2.
In this case, the result is 6.
5. Replace the numerator with the result of the previous step.
You can also express 3⁄5 as 6⁄10. (If you cut the pizza into 10 slices instead of 5, and your
cousin ate 6 slices instead of 3, he would’ve eaten exactly the same amount of pizza.)
After you’ve found a common denominator, you add the two fractions by simply adding the
numerators together: 6⁄10 + 3⁄10 = 9⁄10. Think of it this way: If your cousin eats 6⁄10 of the pizza (which
is just another way of saying 3⁄5), and you eat 3⁄10 of the pizza, together you’ve eaten 9⁄10 of the
pizza.
Method two
Suppose your cousin eats 3⁄5 of one pizza and your sister eats 1⁄6 of another pizza (one that was
cut into 6 slices instead of 5), and you want to know how much pizza has been eaten. In this
case, you need to add 3⁄5 and 1⁄6.
Adding these fractions is a bit more difficult because you can’t divide either denominator by
the other. So you have to find a common denominator that both 5 and 6 divide into evenly:
1. Multiply the denominator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second 
fraction.
In the example case, 5 × 6 = 30. The common denominator for both fractions is 30.
2. Express the first fraction in terms of the new common denominator: 3⁄5 = ?⁄30.
3. Multiply the numerator by the number you used to multiply to result in the new
denominator.
To convert the denominator, 5, to 30, you multiply by 6, so multiply the numerator (3)
by 6. The result is 18. Therefore, the fraction 3⁄5 can be expressed as 18⁄30.
When you’re trying to find the common denominator for a fraction, you must always
multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number. Otherwise, you
change the value of the fraction.
With the problem illustrated above, you multiply the numerator and the denominator
by 6, discovering that 3⁄5 is the same thing as 18⁄30. But if you had multiplied only the
denominator by 6, you would have a new number. 3⁄5 and 3⁄30 don’t have the same value.
71
Chapter 7: Arithmetic Reasoning

4. Next, express the second fraction in terms of the new common denominator: 1⁄6 = 5⁄30.
5. Multiply the numerator of the second fraction by the number you used to result in
the denominator: 5 × 1 = 5. 
The fraction 1⁄6 can be expressed as 5⁄30. After all that work, you can finally add the frac-
tions: 18⁄30 + 5⁄30 = 23⁄30. Now pause and take a bite of pizza.
Another more complicated way of adding fractions is having multiple fractions to add. If you
have more than two fractions with different denominators, you have to find a common
denominator that all the denominators divide into.
1. Suppose you need to add 1⁄2 + 2⁄3 + 3⁄5.
A simple way to find a common denominator is to take the largest denominator (in this
case 5) and multiply it by whole numbers, starting with 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on until you
find a denominator that the other denominators also divide into evenly.
2. If you multiply 5 by 2, you get 10, but 3 doesn’t divide evenly into 10.
So keep going: 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, and so on until you find a number that 2, 3, and 5
can divide into evenly.
3. In this case, 30 is the first number you can find that 2, 3, and 5 can divide into
evenly, so 30 is your common denominator.
Multiplying and simplifying fractions
Multiplying fractions is easy. You just multiply the numerators and then multiply the denomi-
nators. So look at the following equation:
1⁄2 × 3⁄4 × 3⁄5 = ?
You multiply 1 × 3 × 3 = 9 (the numerators) and then 2 × 4 × 5 = 40 (the denominators) to
result in 9⁄40.
Occasionally, when you multiply fractions, you end up with an extremely large fraction that
can be simplified or reduced. To express a fraction in its lowest terms means to put it in such
a way that you can’t divide the numerator and the denominator by the same number (other
than 1).
A number that you can divide into both the numerator and the denominator is called a
common factor. If you have the fraction 6⁄10, both the numerator, 6, and the denominator, 10,
can be divided by the same number, 2. In this example, the common factor is 2. If you per-
form the operations (6 ÷ 2 = 3 and 10 ÷ 2 = 5), 6⁄10 can be expressed in the simpler terms of 3⁄5.
You can’t reduce (simplify) 3⁄5 any further; the only other number that both the numerator
and denominator can be divided by is 1, so the result would be the same, 3⁄5.
Dividing fractions
Dividing fractions is simple if you remember this rule: Dividing a fraction by a number is the
same as multiplying it by the inverse of that number. Of course there are always exceptions.
You can’t use this operation on zero. Zero has no inverse. No one knows why — it just is.
Don’t forget that the inverse of a number is obtained by reversing the number. That means
that if you want to divide a fraction by 5, you simply multiply the fraction by the inverse of 5,
which is 1⁄5.
This process is more easily illustrated if you remember that 5 is the same thing as 5⁄1. In other
words, 5 divided by 1 equals 5 (5 ÷ 1 = 5). And the inverse of 5⁄1 is 1⁄5. To come up with the
inverse of a number, simply stand the number on its head.
72
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

So, to divide a fraction, use the inverse of the number that follows the division symbol (÷)
and substitute a multiplication symbol (×) for the division symbol. Therefore, 1⁄3 ÷ 2 is
expressed as 1⁄3 × 1⁄2, and you already know how to multiply fractions. (If not, check out the
“Multiplying and simplifying fractions” section earlier in the chapter.) 1 × 1 = 1 and 3 × 2 = 6,
so the product of 1⁄3 × 1⁄2 is 1⁄6. Therefore, 1⁄3 ÷ 2 = 1⁄6.
Converting improper fractions to mixed numbers . . . and back again
If you have a fraction with a numerator larger than its denominator, you have an improper
fraction. For example, 7⁄3 is an improper fraction. To put an improper fraction into simpler
(proper) terms, you can change 7⁄3 into a mixed number (a number that includes a whole
number and a fraction). Simply divide the numerator by the denominator. 7 divided by 3
becomes a quotient of 2 with 1⁄3 left over. There’s something left over because 3 doesn’t divide
evenly into 7. The number that’s left over becomes a numerator over the original denomina-
tor. Therefore, 7⁄3 is the same as 21⁄3.
If you want to multiply or divide a mixed number, you need to convert it into a fraction — an
improper fraction. To make the change, you convert the whole number into a fraction and
add it to the fraction you already have. So, if you have 72⁄3, you convert 7 to a fraction, which
gives you 21⁄3, and add that fraction to the fraction that already exists — 2⁄3 — to arrive at 23⁄3.
How do you know that 7 is the same thing as 21⁄3? Well, to convert the whole number into a
fraction, multiply the whole number by the denominator of the existing fraction to arrive at a
new numerator: 7 × 3 = 21. You then place this new numerator over the existing denominator
to achieve 21⁄3. But you’re not done yet. You add that fraction to the remaining fraction to get
the final answer: 21⁄3 + 2⁄3 = 23⁄3. (Check out the “Adding and subtracting fractions” section earlier
in this chapter for the complete scoop on adding fractions.) Or, if you want to get technical,
you can look at the whole process this way, too:
72⁄3 = 
= 23⁄3
Expressing a fraction in other forms: 
Decimals and percents
A fraction can also be expressed as a decimal and as a percent. To change a fraction into a
decimal, you divide the numerator by the denominator (for discussion on what numerators
and denominators are, see “On both sides of the line: Fractions” earlier in the chapter.) Given
that handy explanation, 3⁄5 converted into decimal form is 0.60. To make a decimal into a per-
cent, move the decimal point two spaces to the right and add a percent sign — 0.60 becomes
60.0%. (See the following sections for more thorough discussions of decimals and percents.)
The first space to the right of the decimal is the tenth place, the second space is the hun-
dredth place, and the third is the thousandth (and so on).
Adding and subtracting decimals
To add and subtract decimals, put the numbers in a column and line up the decimal points.
Then add or subtract as if the decimals were whole numbers, keeping the decimal point in
the same position in your answer. Here are two examples:
1.4583
1.4583
+0.55    
–0.55    
2.0083
0.9083
(7 × 3) + 2

Chapter 7: Arithmetic Reasoning

You can add zeroes to the end of a decimal if performing the calculations this way is easier
for you. So 0.1 can be 0.100 without changing its value. In the above problems, 0.55 can be
0.5500 to help you line up the decimal points and perform the operation.
Multiplying decimals
Multiplying a decimal is like multiplying a regular, everyday whole number, except that you
have to place the decimal point in the correct position once you reach an answer. To multi-
ply decimals, start off by adding the number of decimal places (from the right of the decimal
point) in the numbers being multiplied. If one of the numbers you’re multiplying is 3.77, for
example, you have two decimal places. If the other number you’re multiplying is 2.8, you
have one decimal place, so the total number of decimal places in your answer will be three.
In this example, 377 × 28 = 10556. Move the decimal point back to the left 3 places. The result-
ing product is 10.556.
If you’re multiplying a number that has only zeroes to the right of the decimal point, then
those decimals don’t count. For instance, 3 can also be expressed as 3.0, but you wouldn’t
count the “0” as a decimal place. All of the zeroes to the right of the decimal don’t count
unless a number other than zero is also to the right of the decimal. For instance, 3.000007 has
six decimal spaces; 3.0070 has three decimal spaces; and 3.000 has none, at least not for the
purpose of multiplying.
If your answer doesn’t include enough numbers for the decimal spaces you need, then add
as many zeroes as necessary to the left of the answer. Suppose your answer is 50, and you
have to move the decimal point to the left three spaces. There aren’t three spaces in 50. So
you add a zero to the left, to make 050, and put the decimal point in its proper position: .050
is your answer.
Here’s another example: 0.04 × 0.25. Add the decimal places in the two numbers. (There are
four.) Multiply the decimals as if they were whole numbers: 4 × 25 = 100. Then put the deci-
mal point in the correct place in the answer. For 100, count from right to left four places, and
put the decimal point there: 0.0100. Here’s the method behind the madness:
4⁄100 × 25⁄100 = 100⁄1000 = 1⁄10 = 0.01 (or 0.0100)
Dividing decimals
Decimals are divided according to slightly different rules depending on whether both num-
bers in the problem are decimals.
Dividing decimals by whole numbers
If you’re dividing a decimal by a whole number, perform the operation as if the two numbers
were both whole numbers. Move the decimal point over to the right until the decimal is a
whole number, counting the number of decimal places. Remember how many places you
moved the decimal — you need that info later.
Here’s an example:
1.25 ÷ 4 = ?
Follow these steps:
1. Change 1.25 to 125 by moving the decimal two decimal places to the right.
2. Perform the division operation on the whole number: 125 ÷ 4 = 31.25.
But you’re not done yet.
74
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

3. Now move the decimal point two places to the left (to make up for moving it two
places to the right when you made 1.25 into a whole number), and your answer is
0.3125.
Dividing decimals by decimals
To divide a decimal by another decimal in which there are equal numbers after the decimal
point, make the divisor (the decimal going into the other number) a whole number. Move the
decimal point all the way to the right, counting the number of places you move it. Then move
the decimal in the dividend (the number being divided) the same number of decimal places.
So, if you want to divide 0.15 by 0.25, (0.15 ÷ 0.25), follow these steps:
1. Move the decimal point two places to the right in the divisor: 0.25 then becomes 25.
2. Move the decimal in the dividend the same number of spaces: 0.15 becomes 15.
3. Divide 15 by 25.
The result is 0.60. You don’t need to move any more decimals around — 0.60 is your
final answer.
If the dividend is a longer decimal than the divisor, you follow the same steps, but you have
to add an extra step at the end. So, if your problem is 0.125 ÷ 0.50, check out these steps:
1. Move the decimal point in the divisor (0.50) two places to the right so that you have
the whole number 50.
2. Then move the decimal point in the dividend two places, to come up with 12.5.
3. Now the problem looks like this: 12.5 ÷ 50.
4. Convert the first number (12.5) to a whole number by moving the decimal point one
place to the right.
5. Now perform the division operation on the whole numbers: 125 ÷ 50 = 2.5.
6. Move the decimal point one place to the left (to make up for moving it one place to
the right when you converted 12.5 to a whole number).
The answer is 0.25.
When the divisor is a longer decimal than the dividend, such as 0.5 ÷ 0.125, move the decimal
place in the divisor all the way to the right, in this case making 0.125 into 125, counting
spaces. Then move the decimal the same number of spaces in the dividend, adding zeroes as
needed: 0.5 then becomes 500. 500 ÷ 125 = 4, which is the correct answer (0.50 ÷ 0.125 = 4).
Playing with percents
A percent is a fraction based on one hundredths. Five percent (5%) is the same as 5⁄100 or 0.05.
The ASVAB often asks you to calculate 10% off or an increase of 15% on the Arithmetic
Reasoning subtest. You need to be able to convert percents to fractions or decimals to
answer these questions correctly.
Here are some helpful hints for figuring percents:
 To add, subtract, multiply, or divide using percents, change the percent to a fraction or
a decimal.
 Remember, a percent is just hundredths, so 3% is 3⁄100 or 0.03, 22% is 22⁄100 or .22, and 110%
is 110⁄100 or 1.10.
 Just drop the percent sign and move the decimal point two places to the left, adding
zeros as needed.
75
Chapter 7: Arithmetic Reasoning

 The decimal point always starts to the right of a whole number, so 60 is the same thing
as 60.0. Moving the decimal point two spaces to the left leaves you with 0.60.
 After you do the conversion, follow the rules outlined in the earlier sections for per-
forming specific operations on fractions or decimals.
Some fractions convert to repeating decimals — a decimal in which one digit is repeated infi-
nitely. 2⁄3 is the same as 0.66666 (with the sixes never stopping). Repeating decimals are often
rounded to the nearest hundredth; therefore, 2⁄3 rounds to 0.67.
Numbers have relationships, 
too — they’re called ratios
A ratio shows a relationship between two things. It expresses a comparison by proportion.
For example, if Margaret invested in her tattoo parlor at a 2:1 ratio to her business partner
Julie, then Margaret put in two dollars for every one dollar that Julie put in.
Here’s another example:
Suppose you fill up your brand new, shiny SUV. You drive for 240 miles and then refill the tank
with 15 gallons of gas. You can compute your gas mileage by comparing ratios. 240 miles is to
15 gallons as x (the unknown) is to 1 gallon or 240⁄15 = x⁄1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 1
and you get x = 240⁄15, or x = 16. You’re getting 16 miles to the gallon. Time for a tune up!
Remembering important rates
The term rate has various meanings. Essentially, a rate is a fixed quantity (a 5% interest rate,
for example). It can mean the speed at which one works. (John reads at the rate of one page
per minute.) It can also mean an amount of money paid based on another amount. (Life
insurance may be purchased at a rate of $1 per $100 of coverage.)
Word problems often ask you to solve problems concerning travel or simple interest rates.
Two formulas you should commit to memory include the following:
 Distance (d = rt), where d represents the distance traveled, r is the rate of travel, and t
is the amount of time traveled.
 Simple interest (I = prt), where I represents the amount of interest, p is the principle
invested, r is the interest rate, and t is the length of time the money is invested.
Navigating scale drawings
Scale, particularly when used on the ASVAB, relates to scale drawings. For example, a map
drawn to scale may have a one-inch drawing of a road that represents one mile of physical
road in the real world. The Arithmetic Reasoning portion of the ASVAB often asks you to cal-
culate a problem based on scale, which can be represented as a ratio or a fraction.
On a map with a scale of one inch to one mile, the ratio of the scale is represented as 1:1. But
questions are never this easy on the ASVAB. You’re more likely to see something like, “If a
map has a scale of one inch to every four miles. . . .” That scale is expressed as the ratio 1:4.
76
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Try your hand with the following common scale problem:
If the scale on a road map is 1 inch = 250 miles, how many inches would represent 1250 miles?
The problem wants you to determine how many inches on the map represents 1250 miles, if
1 inch is equal to 250 miles.
You know that 1 inch = 250 miles. You also know that x inches is equal to 1250 miles. The
problem can be expressed in ratios 1:250 = x:1250, or 1⁄250 = x⁄1250. Now all you have to do is 
solve for x.
x = 5
So, if 1 inch is equal to 250 miles, then 5 inches would be equal to 1250 miles. If this problem
causes you to scratch your head, check out Chapter 8 for more information on mathematics.
Almost every military job makes use of scales, which is why scale-related questions are so
common on the ASVAB. Whether you’re reading maps at Mountain Warfare School or organiz-
ing trash pickup around the base, you need to use and interpret scales frequently.
Completing a number series
The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest often includes questions that test your ability to logically
complete a series of numbers. Generally, these problems are the only questions that aren’t
word problems, but they test your ability to do arithmetic and to reason because you must
be able to determine how the numbers relate to each other. And to do this, you must also be
able to quickly perform mathematical operations.
Suppose you have a series of numbers that look like this:
1, 4, 7, 10, ?
Each new number is reached by adding three to the previous number. 1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 3 = 7; and
so on. So the next number in the sequence is 10 + 3 or 13. But, of course, the questions on
the ASVAB aren’t quite this simple. More likely, you’ll see something like this:
2, 4, 16, 256, ?
In this case, each number is being multiplied by itself, so 2 × 2 = 4; 4 × 4 = 16; and so on. 
256 × 256 is 65,536 — the correct answer. You may also see sequences like this:
1, 2, 3, 6, ?
In this sequence, the numbers are being added together. 1 + 2 = 3 and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So the next
number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 or 12.

Finding the pattern
To answer sequence questions correctly, you need to figure out the pattern as quickly as pos-
sible. Some people, blessed with superior sequencing genes, can figure out patterns instinc-
tively. The rest of the population has to rely on a more difficult, manual effort.
Finding a pattern in a series of numbers requires you to think about how numbers work. For
instance, in the second example in the preceding section, seeing the number 256 should alert
you that multiplication is the operation because 256 is so much larger than the other num-
bers. On the other hand, because the values in the third example don’t increase by much,
you can guess that the pattern requires addition instead of multiplication.
Dealing with more than one operation in a series
Don’t forget that more than one operation can occur in a series. For example, a series may be
“add one, subtract one, add two, subtract two.” That would look something like this:
2, 3, 2, 4, ?
Because the numbers in the series both increase and decrease as the series continues, you
should suspect that something tricky is going on.
In the beginning of this chapter, we mention that you should be supplied with some scratch
paper. Make sure to use it! Jot down notes while you’re trying to find the pattern in a series.
Writing your work down helps you keep track of what operations you’ve tried.
Tips for Adding to Your Arithmetic Score
Guessing in boot camp is a definite no-no, but guessing in many areas of the ASVAB is per-
fectly fine. On the ASVAB, you aren’t penalized for wrong answers, so it makes sense to guess
if you don’t know the answer. After all, you have a 1 in 4, or 25%, or 0.25, chance to guess the
correct answer. A 25% chance is so much better than the 0% chance you have of getting a
question right if you skip it. Plus, by following the tips in this section, you can do a better job
of guessing correctly and increase your odds of winning the lottery, er, we mean scoring well
on the ASVAB.
Don’t spend much more than a minute on any one problem. If you do, you may not have time
to finish this subtest. But, before you commit to an answer to a math question, double-check
your calculations. One easy way to double-check your work is to plug the answer into the
question.
Logical deductions: Eliminating unlikely answers
Check out the sand-in-the-box problem below. If you read this chapter all the way through,
you may remember this problem from the section “As plain as the nose on a fly: Figuring out
what the question is asking” earlier in this chapter.
How many cubic inches of sand does a cardboard box measuring 12-inches long by 14-inches
wide by 10-inches tall contain?
(A) 52 cubic inches
(B) 88 cubic inches
(C) 120 cubic inches
(D) 1,680 cubic inches
78
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

You may have already shrewdly determined that the question is asking you to find the
volume of the cardboard box. But you don’t remember that Volume = length × width × height.
In fact, you think that the only time anyone told you about volume was when they said that
your stereo was too loud, which is no help to you now.
Still all is not lost. If you use logic, you may be able to eliminate some incorrect or unlikely
answers from the choices, which improves your chances of guessing correctly. Check out the
following thought process:
1. You know that adding the length of each side of the box gives you the perimeter,
which isn’t the right answer.
So, if 12 + 12 + 14 + 14 = the perimeter, or 52 inches, then you know that Choice (A) isn’t
correct. So you continue thinking about the problem.
2. You know that if you multiply the height of the box by its length, you get the area,
not the volume.
So solving for area by multiplying length × width and coming up with 120 doesn’t solve
the problem. Therefore Choice (C) is also wrong.
3. At this point, it may occur to you that if you multiply the height of the box by its
length and by its width, you get its volume.
Or it may not occur to you. But you do know that the volume measurement is going to
be greater than the area measurement. So you can choose an answer that is larger than
the area of the cardboard box. Therefore, if Choice (C), 120, is too small, then Choice
(B), 88, is also too small — and also wrong. So the correct answer is (D), 1680.
Everything doesn’t usually work out quite so neatly on the ASVAB, but in general, you can
eliminate a few choices through logical reasoning. Then you can choose among the remain-
ing answers. Doing this means you have a greater chance of guessing the right answer.
Avoiding testing traps: Complete 
the whole problem!
Don’t forget to solve the entire problem. Sometimes those crafty test makers set little traps
for you to fall into. For instance, suppose you have this question:
John, a roofing contractor, needs to purchase asphalt shingles for a client’s roof. How many
4-x-4-inch shingles are needed to cover a roof that measures 12 x 16 feet?
(A) 192
(B) 12
(C) 27,648
(D) 1,728
This question asks you to perform several operations. You must determine the area of the
roof, figure out the area each shingle will cover, and then come up with the total number of
shingles required to cover the area of the roof.
Many people fail to complete the entire series of calculations because they’re sweating the
pressure from the clock. They think, “Aha! I know how to answer this one!” They figure out
that the area of the roof is 192 square feet (12 × 16) and choose Choice (A) as the correct
answer. But Choice (A) isn’t the correct answer because coming up with 192 square feet is
only a small portion of the problem.
79
Chapter 7: Arithmetic Reasoning

Others folks go further with their calculations and determine that the area of each shingle is
16 inches (4 × 4) and divide 192 (the area of the roof) by 16 to reach 12 shingles. They choose
Choice (B), and they’re wrong. They’re wrong because the roof is measured in feet and the
shingles are measured in inches. The measurements must be converted so the area of the
shingles and the area of the roof are both expressed in the same measuring unit.
The easiest way to figure out this problem is to multiply both the length and the height of the
roof by 12 (because 12 inches are in a foot) and then multiply the height and the length of the
roof together to determine the total area of the roof in inches.
Thus, the area of the roof in inches is 27,648. Some people, pleased that they remembered to
convert feet into inches, choose Choice (C). That’s an incorrect answer because the question
asks how many shingles are needed to cover the roof. To determine the number of shingles
needed, divide 27,648 by 16 (the area in inches of each shingle) to come up with 1,728 shin-
gles (or enough to cause John to go back to the shop for a heavy-duty pickup truck). Correct
answer: Choice (D).
Use your common sense! If an answer doesn’t seem reasonable — like a roof requiring only
12 shingles — you’ve probably made a mistake in your calculations. Go back and try again.
Remember, this subtest tests your ability to make calculations based on real-life problems,
and no real-life roof was ever covered with only 12 shingles.
If you find word problems difficult, you’re not alone. Many people have a hard time with
them. You not only have to foster a talent for analyzing the problem and picking out the
essential information, but also you need a solid foundation in basic math skills. Here are

A
lbert Einstein once said, “Do not worry about your problems with mathematics. I
assure you mine are far greater.” The good professor obviously never faced an upcom-
ing ASVAB exam! Okay, just kidding. You don’t have to be a mathematical theoretician to
score well on the Mathematics Knowledge subtest. This subtest asks questions about basic
high school mathematics. No college or graduate degrees needed.
The Mathematics Knowledge subtest consists of 25 questions, and you have 24 minutes to
complete the subtest. You don’t necessarily have to rush through each calculation, but the
pace you need to set (a little less than a minute per question) doesn’t exactly give you time
to daydream. You have to focus and concentrate to solve each problem quickly and accu-
rately. And no calculators allowed!
The vast majority of questions on this subtest are expressed in mathematical terms, but you
may see some word problems as well. Generally, such word problems are more direct than
the problems you see on the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest (see Chapter 7). But most of the
time, the Mathematics Knowledge subtest only contains one or two questions testing each
specific mathematical concept. For example, one question may ask you to multiply fractions,
the next may ask you to solve a mathematical inequality, and the question after that may ask
you to find the value of an exponent. (If you’re freaked out by the last sentence, calm down.
These concepts are covered in this chapter.)
All this variety forces you to constantly shift your mental gears to quickly deal with different
concepts. You can look at this situation from two perspectives. These mental gymnastics can
be difficult and frustrating, especially if you know everything about solving for x but nothing
about deriving a square root. But variety can also be the spice of life. If you don’t know how
to solve a specific type of problem, this oversight may only cause you to get one or two ques-
tions wrong.
To qualify for certain jobs in the military, you have to score well on the Mathematics
Knowledge subtest. You also have to do well on this subtest (which is part of the AFQT dis-
cussed in Chapter 1) in order to enlist. Turn to the Appendix to find out more about the sub-
test scores needed for specific military jobs.

Just When You Thought You Were Done 
with Vocab: Math Terminology
Like any science, math has its own vocabulary. In order to understand what each problem on
the Mathematical Knowledge subtest asks you to do, you must understand certain mathe-
matical terms:
 Base: A number that’s used as a factor at least two times. For instance, the term 43
(which can be written 4 × 4 × 4, and in which 4 is a factor three times) has a base of 4.
 Factorial: A factorial is represented by an exclamation point (!), and is figured by find-
ing the product of a whole number and all the whole numbers less than it. So 6 factorial
(6!) is 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720.
A factorial helps you determine permutations — all the different possible ways an event
might turn out. For example, if you want to know how many different ways six runners
could finish a race (permutation), you would solve for 6!
 Reciprocal: The number by which another number can be multiplied to produce 1. For
example, the reciprocal of 3 is 1⁄3. If you multiply 3 times 1⁄3 you get 1. The reciprocal of 1⁄6
is 6⁄1 (which is the same thing as 6). 1⁄6 × 6 = 1. Get the idea?
 Root: The square root of a number is the number, which, when multiplied by itself
(squared), equals the original number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6. If you
square 6, or multiply it by itself, you produce 36. (Check out “More about roots: Math
roots, not the movie,” later in this chapter.)
 Rounding: Limiting a number to a few (or no) decimal places. You perform rounding
operations all the time — often without even thinking about it. If you have a $1.97 in
change in your pocket, you may say, “I have about two dollars.” The rounding process
simplifies mathematical operations.
Often, numbers are rounded to the nearest tenth. The ASVAB may ask you to do this.
For any number 5 and over, round up; for any number under 5, round down. For exam-
ple, 1.55 can be rounded up to 1.6, and 1.34 can be rounded down to 1.3.
Many math problems require rounding. (Especially when you’re doing all this 
without a calculator.) For example, pi (π) represents a number approximate to
3.141592653589793238462643383 (and on and on and on). However, in mathematical
operations, it’s common to round π to 3.14.
What Part of X Don’t You Understand? 
Algebra Review
Some people may freak out just hearing the word algebra. But in actuality, algebra is just a
way to put problems into mathematical language using the simplest mathematical terms 
possible. In fact, it’s almost impossible to solve most word problems without some use of
algebra.
In algebra, you often hear about “solving for x” or “solving for the unknown,” but what’s the
unknown? The unknown is the answer you want find. Check out this example:

Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Rod’s mom has worked up a powerful thirst solving a ton of math problems and asked Rod to
run to the corner store and get her one of those super-duper gigantic nuclear soft drinks. If a
regular-sized soft drink costs $0.50 and the super-duper gigantic nuclear size costs three
times the cost of the regular size, how much will Rod have to spend?
You can express this problem in terms of x, with x being the cost of the super-duper sized
drink: x equals 3 (the price difference) × 50 cents. Written a bit more formally, the equation
looks like this: x = 3 × .50 or 3 × .50 = x.
What if you don’t know how much the regular sized soft drink costs? You can express this
missing piece of information in an equation as well: x (how much it will cost to buy a super-
duper size) equals 3 (the cost increase) times p (the price of one regular sized drink). Once
again, written a bit more formally, the equation looks like this: x = 3 × p.
You can remove the multiplication symbol in algebraic expressions when using a combina-
tion of letters and numbers. Therefore, the equation x = 3 × p can also be written x = 3p. The
multiplication symbol is implied.
The letters in an algebra problem are commonly called variables, meaning that the number
they stand for varies or changes.
What? More vocabulary? Algebra-related terms
Special algebra terms are used to describe how numbers function and how they relate to
each other. Knowing what these terms mean is important to your ASVAB success:
 Composite number: A whole number that can be divided evenly by itself and by 1, as
well as by one or more other whole numbers, which means that it has more than two
factors. Examples of composite numbers are 6, 8, and 9.
 Exponents: You can think of exponents as a shorthand method of indicating multiplica-
tion. For example, 15 × 15 can also be expressed as 152, which is also known as “15
squared” or “15 to the second power.” The small number (2) written slightly above and
to the right of a number is called the exponent. An exponent indicates the number of
times you multiply the number it accompanies by itself — 152 (15 × 15) isn’t the same
as 15 × 2.
To express 15 × 15 × 15 using this shorthand method, simply write it as 153, which is
also called “15 cubed” or “15 to the third power.” Again, 153 isn’t the same as 15 × 3.
 Factors: Numbers that can divide into a composite number. To factor a composite
number, you simply determine the numbers that you can divide into it. For example,
8 can be divided by the numbers 2 and 4 (in addition to 1 and 8), so 2 and 4 are 
factors of 8.
 Prime number: A whole number that can be divided evenly by itself and by 1 but not
by any other number, which means that it has exactly two factors. (Check out the defi-
nition of factor a bit earlier in this list.) Examples of prime numbers are 2, 5, and 11.
When all things are equal: The algebra equation
Algebra problems are equations, which means that the quantities on both sides of the equal
sign are equal — they’re the same. 2 = 2. 1 + 1 = 2. And 3 – 1 = 2. In all these cases, the quanti-
ties are the same on both sides of the equal sign. So, if x = 2, then x is 2 because the equal
sign says so.
83
Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

Solving one-step equations involving addition and subtraction
If x + 1 = 2, then x must be 1, because only 1 added to 1 is 2. So far, so simple, so good. But
what if the equation is a little more complicated:
x + 47,432 = 50,000
To find out what x equals, which solves the problem, you need to isolate x on one side of the
equal sign. To get that job done, you have to move any other numbers on the x side of the
equal sign to the other side of the equal sign.
By looking at the x side of the equation, you can see that it’s an addition problem. To move
the number on the x side to the opposite side, you have to perform the inverse operation.
The inverse operation of addition is subtraction. (For a full rundown on inverse operations,
check out Chapter 7.) So, to move 47,432 from the x side to the non-x side of the equation,
simply subtract it from both sides:
x + 47,432 – 47,432 = 50,000 – 47,432
Performing these operations removes the 47,432 from the x side of the equation (47,432 –
47,432 = 0, so that side of the equation is x + 0 or simply x) and gives you 2,568 on the non-x
side of the equation (50,000 – 47,432 = 2,568). You’re left with the final answer:
x = 2,568
To double-check that this answer is correct, plug your answer into the original problem:
x + 47,432 = 50,000
2,568 + 47,432 = 50,000
If you plug the answer in and it doesn’t work, you’ve made an error in your calculations. Start
again; remember that you’re trying to isolate x on one side of the equation.
You can perform any calculation on either side of an equation as long as you do it to both
sides of the equation. That keeps the equation equal.
Multiplying and dividing using integers
An integer is any positive or negative whole number or zero. The ASVAB often requires you to
work with integers such as –6x = 36. (Don’t forget, 6x is the same thing as 6 × x.)
In multiplication and division, if the two terms being operated on (on either side of the equal
sign) are both positive numbers or both negative numbers, the answer is a positive number.
If one number is negative and the other is positive, the answer is negative.
So to solve this problem, –6x = 36, you need to isolate x, so perform an inverse operation
(remember, the inverse operation of multiplication is division):
–6x ÷ -6 = 36 ÷ –6
x = –6
The answer is a negative number because the two terms, 36 and –6, have different signs.
In an algebra equation, if the same letter is used more than once, it stands for the same
number. 3x + 2x = 10, the first x will never be a different number from the second x. In this
case, x = 2 (both times).
84
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

You can only combine like terms when operating on algebraic expressions: 3x + 3x = 6x, but
3x + 3y doesn’t equal 6xy, nor does x2 + x3 = x5 (see the section “Explaining exponents,” later
in this chapter to find out more about algebra involving exponents).
Solving multistep equations
Not all algebra problems have one-step solutions. (That would be too easy, and you wouldn’t
sweat nearly as much.) Solving algebra problems on the ASVAB often requires you to perform
several steps.
An example of a multistep equation is when x shows up on both sides of the equal sign. Then
you have to get rid of x from one side of the equation by moving an x from one side to the
other. You do this by performing the inverse operation.
Suppose you want to solve this equation:
3x + 3 = 9 + x
Follow these steps:
1. To remove the x from one side of the equation, perform the inverse operation:
3x + 3 – x = 9 + x – x. This equation can also be stated as 3x + 3 – 1x = 9 + 0.
2. Perform the subtraction operation.
2x + 3 = 9
3. To finish solving the problem, subtract 3 from each side of the equation.
2x + 3 – 3 = 9 – 3
2x = 6
4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.
2x ÷ 2 = 6 ÷ 2
x = 3
When you have a variable by itself, such as x, it’s always equal to 1 × that variable (or one of
that variable), like 1x, even if the 1 isn’t written out. In fact, any number is equal to 1 times
itself, so you could also say 2 = 2 × 1. Sometimes this comes in handy when you’re solving
those algebra problems.
Explaining exponents
Exponents are an easy way to show that a number is to be multiplied by itself a certain
number of times. For example, 52 is the same as 5 × 5. y3 is the same as y × y × y. The number
or variable that’s multiplied by itself is called the base, and the number or variable showing
how many times it is to be multiplied by itself is called the exponent or power.
Here are important rules when working with exponents:
 Any base raised to the power of one equals itself. Example: x1 = x.
 Any base raised to the zero power (except 0) equals 1. Example: x0 = 1.
 To multiply terms with the same base, you add the exponents. Example: x2 × x3 = x5.
 To divide terms with the same base, you subtract the exponents. Example x5 (divided
by) x2 = x3.
85
Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

 If a base has a negative exponent, it’s equal to its reciprocal with a positive exponent.
Example: x-3 = 1⁄x3.
 When a product has an exponent, each factor is raised to that power. Example: (xy)3 =
x3 × y3.
A note about scientific notation
Scientific notation is a compact format for writing very large or very small numbers. While 
its most often used in scientific fields, you may find a question or two on the Mathematics
Knowledge subtest of the ASVAB, asking you to covert a number to scientific notation or
vice-versa.
Scientific notation separates a number into two parts: a decimal fraction, usually between 
1 and 10, and a power of ten. Therefore 1.25 × 104 means 1.25 × 10 to the fourth power or
12,500; 5.79 × 10-8 means 5.79 ÷ by 10 to the eighth power or 0.0000000579.
More about roots: Math roots, not the movie
A square root is the factor (see the “What? More vocabulary? Algebra-related terms” section
earlier in this chapter) of a number that, when multiplied by itself, produces the number.
Take the number 36, for example. One of the factors of 36 is 6. If you multiply 6 by itself 
(6 × 6), you come up with 36, so 6 is the square root of 36. The number 36 has other factors
such as 18. But, if you multiply 18 by itself (18 × 18), you get 324, not 36. So 18 isn’t the
square root of 36.
One number can only have one square root.
All numbers are grouped into one of two camps when it comes to roots:
 Perfect squares: Only a few numbers, called perfect squares, have exact square roots.
 Irrational numbers: All the rest have square roots that include decimals that go on 
forever and have no pattern that repeats (nonrepeating, nonterminating decimals), so
they’re called irrational numbers.
The sign for a square root is called the radical sign. It looks like this: √. Here’s how you use it:
√36 means “the square root of 36” — in other words, 6.
Perfect squares
Square roots can be difficult to find at times without a calculator, but because you can’t use a
calculator during the test, you’re going to have to use your mind and some guessing meth-
ods. To find the square root of a number without a calculator, make an educated guess and
then verify your results.
To use the educated-guess method, you have to know the square roots of a few perfect
squares. One good way to do this is to study the squares of the square roots 1 through 12:
 1 is the square root of 1 (1 × 1 = 1)
 2 is the square root of 4 (2 × 2 = 4)
 3 is the square root of 9 (3 × 3 = 9)
86
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

 4 is the square root of 16 (4 × 4 = 16)
 5 is the square root of 25 (5 × 5 = 25)
 6 is the square root of 36 (6 × 6 = 36)
 7 is the square root of 49 (7 × 7 = 49)
 8 is the square root of 64 (8 × 8 = 64)
 9 is the square root of 81 (9 × 9 = 81)
 10 is the square root of 100 (10 × 10 = 100)
 11 is the square root of 121 (11 × 11 = 121)
 12 is the square root of 144 (12 × 12 = 144)
Irrational numbers
When the ASVAB asks you to figure square roots of numbers that don’t have perfect squares,
the task gets a bit more difficult. If you have to find the square root of a number that isn’t a
perfect square, the ASVAB usually asks you to find the square root to the nearest tenth.
Suppose you run across this problem:
√54
Think about what you know:
 You know from the preceding section that the square root of 49 is 7, and 54 is slightly
greater than 49.
 You also know that the square root of 64 is 8, and 54 is slightly less than 64.
 So, if the number 54 is somewhere between 49 and 64, the square root of 54 is some-
where between 7 and 8.
 Because 54 is closer to 49 than to 64, the square root will be closer to 7 than to 8, so
you can try 7.3 as the square root of 54:
1. Multiply 7.3 by itself.
7.3 × 7.3 = 53.29, which is very close to 54.
2. Try multiplying 7.4 by itself to see if it’s any closer to 54.
7.4 × 7.4 = 54.76, which isn’t as close to 54 as 53.29.
3. So 7.3 is the square root of 54 to the nearest tenth without going over.
Exponential roots
The wonderful world of math is also home to concepts like cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots,
and so on. These roots are a factor of a number, which, when cubed (multiplied by itself
three times), taken to the fourth power (multiplied by itself four times), and so on, produce
the original number. A couple of examples seem to be in order:
 The cube root of 27 is 3. If you cube 3 (also known as raising it to the third power or
multiplying 3 × 3 × 3), the product is 27.
 The fourth root of 16 is that number which, when multiplied by itself four times, equals
16. Any guesses? Drumroll, please: 2 is the fourth root of 16 because 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.

Looking at Math from a Different 
Angle: Geometry Review
Geometry is the branch of mathematics that makes grown adults cry — end of discussion.
What? You want a more specific explanation of geometry than that? Okay, geometry is the
branch of mathematics concerned with measuring things and defining the properties of and
relationships between and among shapes, lines, points, angles, and other such objects. Hey,
don’t blame us; you asked for it.
Before you read any further, you should note a few things to remember:
 Arcs, circles, triangles, and angles are measured in degrees and (not very often) in 
minutes (which are smaller than degrees).
 A circle has 360 degrees (360°).
 A quadrilateral (shapes with four sides like a square or rectangle) has 360°.
 Any arc or angle that isn’t a complete circle or quadrilateral measures less than 360°.
Outlining angles
Angles are formed when two lines intersect at a point. Angles are measured in degrees. The
greater the number of degrees, the wider the angle is:
 A straight line is 180°.
 A right angle is exactly 90°.
 An acute angle is more than 0° and less than 90°.
 An obtuse angle is more than 90° but less than 180°.
 Complementary angles are two angles that equal 90° when added together.
 Supplementary angles are two angles that equal 180° when added together.
Take a look at the different types of angles in Figure 8-1.

Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Pointing out triangle types
A triangle consists of three straight lines whose three angles always add up to 180°. The 
sides of a triangle are called legs. Triangles can be classified according to the relationship
between their angles or the relationship between their sides or some combination of these
relationships:
 Isosceles triangle: Has two equal sides, and the angles opposite the equal sides are
also equal
 Equilateral triangle: Has three equal sides, and all the angles measure 60°
 Right triangle: Has one right angle (90°); therefore, the remaining two angles are com-
plementary (add up to 90°)
The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, which is the longest side of a
right triangle.
Check out Figure 8-2 to see what these triangles look like.
When working with triangles, there are a few other terms and concepts you need to know:
 You can find the perimeter — the distance around a shape — of a triangle by adding
together the length of the three sides.
 The area — the space within a shape — of a triangle is one-half the product of the base
(the bottom or the length) and the height (the tallest point of the triangle) or 1/2bh.
 The Pythagorean theorem states that if you know the length of two sides of a right trian-
gle, the length of the third side can be determined, using the formula a2 + b2 = c2, where
a and b represent the length of the two known sides.
Back to square one: Quadrilaterals
Quadrilaterals — shapes with four sides — all contain angles totaling 360°. Many different
types of quadrilaterals exist:
 Parallelograms have opposite sides that are parallel, and their opposite sides and
angles are equal.
 Rectangles have all right angles.
 Rhombuses have four sides of equal length, but the angles don’t have to be right
angles.

Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

 Squares have four sides of equal length, and all the angles are right angles.
 Trapezoids have at least two sides that are parallel.
See Figure 8-3 for the illustration of these quadrilaterals.
To determine the perimeter of a quadrilateral, simply add the length of all the sides. And to
figure the area of a rectangle (including squares) multiply length × width.
Going around in circles
A circle is formed when the points of a closed line are all located equal distances from its
center. A circle always has 360°. The closed line of a circle is called its perimeter or circumfer-
ence. The radius of a circle is the measurement from the center of the circle to any point on
the circumference of the circle. The diameter of the circle is measured as a line passing
through the center of the circle, from a point on one side of the circle all the way to a point
on the other side of the circle. The diameter of a circle is always twice as long as the radius
of a circle, or d = 2r. (See Figure 8-4, which shows you the parts of a circle.)
Navigating the circumference
To measure the circumference of a circle, use the number pi (π). Although π is a lengthy
number, when used in geometry, it’s generally rounded to 3.14 or 22⁄7. Because π is rounded to
3.14 or 22⁄7, when you solve a problem using π, the equal sign isn’t used because the answer
isn’t exactly equal to the equation (due to the rounding). A symbol called the approximation
symbol (≈) is used.

Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Use this formula:
Circumference = π × diameter
or
C = πd
Because the radius of a circle is half its diameter, you can also use the radius to determine
the circumference of a circle. Here’s the formula:
C = 2πr
Suppose that you know that the pie you just baked has a diameter of 9 inches. You can deter-
mine its circumference by using the circumference formula:
C = πd
C ≈3.14 × 9
C ≈28.26 inches
Mapping out the area
Determining the area of a circle also requires the use of π.
Area = π × the square of the circle’s radius
or
A = πr2
To determine the area of a 9-inch-diameter pie, multiply π by the square of 4.5. Why 4.5 and
not 9? Remember, the radius is always half the diameter, and the diameter is 9 inches.
A = πr2
A ≈3.14 × 4.52
A ≈3.14 × 4.5 × 4.5
A ≈3.14 × 20.25
A ≈63.585 inches
Filling ’er up: Calculating volume
Volume is the space a solid (three-dimensional) shape takes up. You can think of volume as
how much a shape would hold if you poured water into it. Volume is measured in cubic units.
The formula for finding volume depends on the object:
 For rectangular objects, you multiply length × width (depth) × height. This is possible
because the length, width, and height of a rectangle are consistent throughout the
whole shape. The formula looks like this: V = lwh.
For a box that measures 5-feet long, 6-feet deep, and 2-feet tall, you simply multiply 
5 × 6 × 2 to arrive at a volume of 60 cubic feet.
91
Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

 For a cylinder that has two circles for its bases, the calculation is V = (πr2)h or, 
volume = pi × the radius squared × height.
For a cylinder that has a radius of 2 inches and a height of 10 inches, here’s the deal:
Multiply the value of pi (3.14) times 4 (which is the radius squared) times 10, or 
3.14 × 4 × 10 = 125.6 cubic inches.
Calculating without a Calculator: 
All You Need to Know
Too bad those ASVAB honchos don’t allow you to use a calculator on the test. That would
make it a breeze. Remember, though, the Mathematics Knowledge subtest of the ASVAB is
based on arithmetic you most likely studied in high school. In this section, you come up to
speed on how to solve problems that the Mathematics Knowledge subtest commonly throws
at its victims, um, test takers.
Factoring to find original numbers
Now and then, the ASVAB gives you a product (the answer to a multiplication problem), 
and you have to find the original numbers that were multiplied together to produce that
product. This process is called factoring. You use factors when you combine like terms and
add fractions.
Take, for example, this product:
4xy + 2x2
To factor this product, follow these steps:
1. Find the highest common factor — the highest number that evenly divides all the
terms in the expression.
In this case, the highest number that divides into both terms is 2.
2. Then figure out the common factors for the variables too.
In this case, the highest variable that divides into both xy and x2 is x.
3. Okay — take what you know to this point, and you can see that the highest common
factor is 2x.
So far, so good.
4. Now divide 2x into both terms in the expression.
The resulting terms are 2y + x.
5. Finally, multiply the entire expression by 2x to set the equation equal to its original
value.
Doing so produces the factors of 2x(2y + x).
Time to try something a little more complicated: factoring a trinomial (a problem with three
terms). Look at the below example:
x2 – 12x + 20
92
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

To factor this product, follow these steps:
1. Find the factors of the first term of the trinomial.
The factors of x2 are x and x (x × x = x2). Put those factors (x and x) on the left side of
two sets of parentheses:
(x )(x )
2. Determine whether the two expressions will be positive or negative.
You can see that the last term in the trinomial (+ 20) has a plus sign. That means the
resulting factors must be either plus or minus, because two pluses result in a positive
number and two minuses result in a positive number. Because the second term (–12x)
is a negative number, both of the factors must be negative. (Because two negative num-
bers multiplied equals a positive number.)
(x – )(x – )
3. Find the number that’ll be used as the second term in the resulting factors.
4. Plug the two numbers into the right side of the parentheses.
This part can be tricky. The factors of the third term, when added or subtracted
together must equal the second term of the trinomial. The factors of 20 (the third 
term) which combines with 12 are 2 and 10 because 2 × 10 = 20 (the third term) and 
2 + 10 = 12 (the second term).
(x – 2)(x + 10)
The factors of x2 – 12x + 20 are x – 2 and x + 10.
Making alphabet soup: The quadratic equation
Algebra questions often ask you to solve for x or solve for an unknown. These questions can
be expressed, for example, as x = 2 + 3. You simply isolate the unknown on one side of the
equation and solve the other side to learn what x equals. In this case, x equals 5. The topic 
of solving for unknowns is covered in more depth in the section, “What Part of X Don’t You
Understand? Algebra Review,” earlier in this chapter.
So what’s a quadratic equation? Sounds a little scary, huh? The Mathematical Knowledge
subtest may ask you to solve one of these equations, but have no fear. You’ve come to the
right place. This section can help.
A quadratic equation is an equation that includes the square of an unknown. The exponent in
these equations is never higher than 2 (because it would then no longer be the square of an
unknown, but a cube or something else). Here are some examples of quadratic equations:
x2 – 4x = –4
2x2 = x + 6
x2 = 36
Simple quadratic equations (those that consist of just one squared term and a number) can
be solved by using the square root rule:
If x2 = √k, then x = ± k, as long as k isn’t a negative number.
93
Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

Remember to include the ± sign, which indicates the answer is a positive or negative number.
Take the following simple quadratic equation:
7y2 = 28
1. First get rid of the pesky 7 by dividing both sides by 7.
The result is y2 = 4.
2. Using the square root rule, you then take the square root of both sides of the 
equation.
√y2 = y and √4 = 2
y = ± 2
The above steps work with simple quadratic equations, but when you’re solving a complex
quadratic equation, you put all the terms on one side of the equal sign, making the equation
equal zero. In other words, get the quadratic equation into this form: ax2 + bx + c = 0, where 
a, b, and c are numbers and x is unknown. Take a look at the following equation:
x2 – 2x = 15
You can convert this equation to quadratic form by subtracting 15 from both sides of the
equation.
x2 – 2x – 15 = 0
The most efficient way to solve most quadratic equations is by factoring the equation and
then setting each separate factor equal to zero. See the section “Factoring to find original
numbers” earlier in this chapter.
Look at this equation again:
x2 – 2x – 15 = 0
(x – 5)(x + 3) = 0
x – 5 = 0 and x + 3 = 0
x = 5 and x = –3
The solution for x2 – 2x – 15 is 5, –3

Some algebra problems state that two numbers aren’t equal to each other (thus they’re
inequalities). In an inequality, the first number is either greater than (≥) or less than (≤) the
second.
Just like with equations, the solution to an inequality is a value that makes the inequality
true. For the most part, you solve inequalities the same as you would solve a normal equa-
tion. There are some facts of inequality life you need to keep in mind, however. Short and
sweet, here they are:
 Negative numbers are less than zero and less than positive numbers.
 Zero is less than positive numbers but greater than negative numbers.
 Positive numbers are greater than negative numbers and greater than zero.

Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

A regular algebraic equation includes the equal sign (=), because the very basis of the equa-
tion is that one side of the equation must equal the other. Quite the opposite is true with
inequalities, and they have their own special symbols, used to express the differences:
 ≠means does not equal in the way that 3 does not equal 4 or 3 ≠4.
 > means greater than in the way that 4 is greater than 3 or 4 > 3.
 < means less than in the way the 3 is less than 4, or 3 < 4.
 ≤means less than or equal to in the way that x may be less than or equal to 4 or x ≤4.
 ≥means greater than or equal to in the way that x may be greater than or equal to 3 or
x ≥3.
To solve an inequality, you follow the same rules as you would for solving any other equa-
tion. For example, check out this inequality:
3 + x ≥4
To solve it, simply isolate x by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
3 + x – 3 ≥4 – 3
or
x ≥1
The only exception to this rule is when you multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by
a negative number. In that case, the inequality sign is reversed. So, if you multiply both sides
of the inequality 3 < 4 by –4, your answer is –12 > –16.
Test-Taking Techniques for Your 
Mathematical Journey
As with most of the other subtests on the ASVAB, guessing on the Mathematical Knowledge
subtest doesn’t count against you. So scribble in an answer, any answer, on your answer
sheet because, if you don’t, your chances of getting that answer right are zero. But, if you
take a shot at it, your chances increase to 25%, or 1 in 4. In the following sections, you find
some tips that can help you improve those odds, even when you don’t know how to solve
the problem.
If you’re not confident in your math skills you may wish to invest some extra study time.

For Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For Dummies by Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math For
Dummies by Scott Hatch — all published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
Knowing what the question is asking
This subtest presents most of the questions as straightforward math problems, not word
problems, so knowing what the question is asking you to do is easier. However, reading each
question carefully, paying particular attention to plus (+) and minus (–) signs (which can
really change the answer to a question) is still important. Finally, make sure you do all the
calculations needed to produce the correct answer. Check out this example:
95
Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

Find the value of √(812).
(A) 9
(B) 18
(C) 81
(D) 6,561
If you’re in a hurry, you may put 9 down as an answer because you remember that the square
root of 81 is 9. Or, in a rush, you could multiply 9 (the square root of 81) by 2 instead of
squaring it, as the exponent indicates you should. Or, you might just multiply 81 by 81 to get
6,561 without remembering that you also need to then find the square root, which gives you
the correct answer: Choice (C). So make sure you perform all the operations needed (and
that you perform the correct operations) to find the right answer.
Figuring out what you’re solving for
Even though getting artistic with your answer sheet can be fun, the techniques in this section
help you try to first improve your chances of guessing the right answer. Right out of the gate,
read the question carefully. Some questions can seem out of your league at first glance, but if
you look at them again, a light may go on in your brain. Suppose you get this question:
s number of students are in a classroom. 2⁄5 of the students are enlisted personnel. 1⁄2 of the
enlisted personnel are privates. How many privates are in the audience?
(A) 21⁄2 s
(B) 2s
(C)
1⁄5 s
(D)
1⁄10s
At first glance, you may think, “Oh, no! Solve for an unknown, s. I don’t remember how to do
that!” But, if you look at the question again, you may see that you’re not solving for s at all.
You’re simply multiplying a fraction. So you take 2⁄5 times 1⁄2 and arrive at 2⁄10, but you should
reduce that fraction to get 1⁄5. The correct answer is Choice (C). (See Chapter 6 for a refresher
on multiplying fractions.)
Solving what you can and guessing the rest
Sometimes a problem requires multiple operations for you to arrive at the correct answer. 
If you don’t know how to do all of the operations, don’t give up. You can still narrow your
guess down by doing what you can.
Because the Mathematical Knowledge subtest doesn’t penalize you for guessing, mark the
answer sheet even if you’re clueless. You can even make a pretty design on your answer
sheet and still have a one-in-four chance of getting each answer right.
96
Part III: All’s Fair in Math and War: Arithmetic Skills 

Suppose this question confronts you:
What’s the value of (0.03)3?
(A) 0.0027
(B) 0.06
(C) 0.000027
(D) 0.0009
Say you don’t remember how to multiply decimals. All isn’t lost! If you remember how to use
exponents, you’ll remember that you have to multiply 0.03 × 0.03 × 0.03. So, if you simplify
the problem and just multiply 3 × 3 × 3, without worrying about those pesky zeroes, your
answer will have a 27 in it. With this pearl of wisdom in mind, you can see that Choice (B),
which adds 0.03 to 0.03, is wrong. It also means that Choice (D), which multiplies 0.03 and
0.03, is wrong. Now you have two possible answers, and you’ve improved your chances of
guessing the right one to 50 percent! By multiplying 3 × 3 × 3 to get 27, don’t forget to put the
decimal points back in. You have six places to make up, so move the decimal from 27.0 six
places to the left to get 0.000027. The correct answer is Choice (C).
Don’t forget to use that scratch paper! Suppose you run across this question:
A child is building a tower of blocks. Each block is a cube. Some blocks are white, and
some blocks are red. Red blocks surround each white block. How many red blocks sur-
round each white block?
This problem may be difficult to figure out until you sketch a six-sided block (a cube) on your
scratch paper and realize that the block must be surrounded by six other blocks. Sometimes
drawing that visual helps you solve the problem.
Using the process of elimination
Another method (besides guessing) you can use when you run into questions where you
draw a total blank is to plug the possible answers into the equation and see which one
works. Say the following problem is staring you right in the eyes:
Solve for x: x – 5 = 32
(A) x = 5
(B) x = 32
(C) x = -32
(D) x = 37
You’re not sure what to do. If you’re totally stumped and can’t think of any possible way of
approaching this problem, simply plugging in each of the four answers to see which one is
correct is your best bet.
 Answer A: 5 – 5 = 32, which you know is wrong
 Answer B: 32 – 5 = 32, which is wrong
 Answer C: -32 – 5 = 32, which is wrong
 Answer D: 37 – 5 = 32, which is correct
97
Chapter 8: Mathematics Knowledge

Don’t forget that plugging in all the answers is time consuming, so save this procedure until
you’ve answered all the problems you can answer. If you’re taking the computer version, you
can’t skip a question, so remember to budget your time wisely. If you don’t have much time,
just make a guess and move on. You may be able to solve the next question easily.
Double-checking your work
Although you don’t have a ton of time to complete the Mathematical Knowledge subtest, 
you do have about a minute per problem. Although a minute doesn’t allow for a lot of head
scratching, it’s more time than you think. So double-check your answers before putting your
pencil down (or before going on to the next problem on the computer).
You can go over your calculations again to make sure that you didn’t make an error. You can
also plug your answer into the original equation to make sure that it’s the correct answer.
Then move along, private!

t’s time to put those calculators, pocket computers, and abacuses away — the actual
ASVAB doesn’t allow you to use anything except paper, pencil, and a winning personality
to solve the math problems. You should use the old-fashioned way on these practice ques-
tions, too. Tell you what. Instead of a number two pencil, you can use a number three or
four instead. Heck, you can even use a pen. See? We’re easy. No pressure here!
You may be tired of hearing this by now (if you’ve taken any of the other tests in this book),
but the math subtests of the ASVAB are very important because they’re used in calculating
your AFQT score, which makes or breaks you as far as your eligibility to join the military.
Additionally, every technical-oriented job in the military requires good to excellent math
scores. Chapter 1 explains the AFQT in more detail.
On the ASVAB (and on the full-length practice tests later in this book), you’ll see 30
Arithmetic Reasoning questions and 25 Mathematics Knowledge questions. In this chapter,
you only have to sweat through 25 total questions.
Arithmetic Reasoning Practice Questions
Arithmetic Reasoning questions are mathematical problems expressed in a story format.
Your goal is to determine what the question is asking by picking out the relevant factors
needed to solve the problem, setting up mathematical equations as needed, and arriving at a
correct solution. Sounds easy, right? Check out Chapter 7 for more help with Arithmetic
Reasoning.
1. If apples are on sale at 15 for $3, what’s the cost of each apple?
(A) 50 cents
(B) 25 cents
(C) 20 cents
(D) 30 cents
Divide 3 by 15, so the correct answer is Choice (C).

2. A noncommissioned officer challenged her platoon of 11 enlisted women to beat her record
of performing a 26-mile training run in 4 hours. If all of the enlisted women match her
record, how many miles will they have run?
(A) 71.5 miles
(B) 6.5 miles
(C) 286 miles
(D) 312 miles
Multiply 26 × 11. The other information in the question is irrelevant — it’s there to throw you
off. The correct answer is Choice (C).
3. Margaret gets her hair cut and colored at an expensive salon in town. She’s expected to
leave a 15% tip for services. If a haircut is $45 and a color treatment is $150, how much of a
tip should Margaret leave?
(A) $22.50
(B) $29.25
(C) $20.00
(D) $195.00
Add 45 and 150 and multiply the answer by .15 (15%). The correct answer is Choice (B).
4. A bag of sand holds 1 cubic foot of sand. How many bags of sand are needed to fill a square
sandbox measuring 5-feet long and 1-foot high?
(A) 25 bags
(B) 5 bags
(C) 10 bags
(D) 15 bags
To find the volume of the sandbox you take l × w × h. Don’t forget that the measurements are
for a square sandbox, so you can assume that if the box is 5-feet long, then it’s also 5-feet
wide. So 5 × 5 × 1 is 25 cubic feet. Each bag holds one cubic foot of sand. Choice (A) is the
correct answer.
5. The day Samantha arrived at boot camp the temperature reached a high of 90 degrees in the
shade and a low of -20 at night in the barracks. What was the average temperature for the
day?
(A) 55 degrees
(B) 45 degrees
(C) 70 degrees
(D) 62 degrees
Divide the temperature range of 110 degrees by 2 to reach the average temperature. Choice
(A) is the correct answer.

6. Farmer Beth has received an offer to sell her 320-acre farm for $3,000 per acre. She agrees 
to give the buyer $96,000 worth of land. What fraction of Farmer Beth’s land is the buyer
getting?
(A)
1⁄4
(B)
1⁄10
(C)
1⁄5
(D)
2⁄3
$96,000 divided by $3,000 (price per acre) equals 32 acres. 32 acres divided by 320 acres
(total of the farm) equals 10% or 1⁄10 of the land. The correct answer is Choice (B).
7. A map is drawn so that 1 inch equals 3 miles. On the map, the distance from Kansas City to
Denver is 1921⁄2 inches. How far is the round trip from Kansas City to Denver in miles?
(A) 1921⁄2 miles
(B) 577.5 miles
(C) 385 miles
(D) 1,155 miles
Multiply 192.5 × 3 to get the distance in miles and then double the answer to account for
both legs of the trip. Choice (D) is the correct answer.
8. Margaret and Julie can sell their tattoo parlor for $150,000. They plan to divide the proceeds
according to the ratio of the money they each invested in the business. Margaret put in the
most money at a 3:2 ratio to Julie. How much money should Julie get from the sale?
(A) $50,000
(B) $30,000
(C) $60,000
(D) $90,000
According to the ratio, Margaret should get 3⁄5 of the money and Julie should get 2⁄5 of the
money. The fractions are calculated by adding both sides of the ratio together (3 + 2 = 5) 
to determine the denominator. Each side of the ratio then becomes a numerator. Divide
$150,000 by 5, then multiply the answer by 2 to determine Julie’s share of the money. The
correct answer is Choice (C).
9. What is the fifth number in the series 4, 8, 16, 32?
(A) 48
(B) 64
(C) 96
(D) 8
The pattern is to double each number: 4 + 4 = 8; 8 + 8 = 16; 16 + 16 = 32; so 32 + 32 = 64. The
correct answer is Choice (B).

10. In the military, 1⁄4 of an enlisted person’s time is spent sleeping and eating, 1⁄12 is spent stand-
ing at attention, 1⁄6 is spent staying fit, and 2⁄5 is spent working. The rest of the time is spent at
the enlisted person’s own discretion. How many hours per day does this discretionary time
amount to?
(A) 6.0 hours
(B) 1.6 hours
(C) 2.4 hours
(D) 3.2 hours
Calculate this answer by first assigning a common denominator of 60 to all the fractions and
adjusting the numerators accordingly: 15⁄60, 5⁄60, 10⁄60, and 24⁄60. Add the fractions to find out how
much time is allotted to all of these tasks. The total time is 54⁄60, which leaves 6⁄60 or 1⁄10 of the
day to the enlisted person’s discretion. 1⁄10 of 24 hours is 2.4 hours. Therefore, Choice (C) is
the correct answer.
11. A designer sells a square yard of carpet for $15.00. The same carpet can be purchased at the
carpet outlet store for $12.50. What is the percent difference in the higher priced carpet?
(A) The designer’s carpet costs about 17% more than the outlet-store carpet.
(B) The designer’s carpet costs about 20% more than the outlet-store carpet.
(C) The designer’s carpet costs about 25% more than the outlet-store carpet.
(D) The designer’s carpet costs about 12% more than the outlet-store carpet.
Subtract the lower price from the higher price: $15.00 – $12.50 = $2.50. Divide the difference
by the lower price to determine the percent difference: $2.50 ÷ $12.50 = 0.20 = 20%. The cor-
rect answer is Choice (B).
12. Terry got a haircut for $32.50, a hair color for $112.20, and a manicure for $17.25. How much
total money did she spend at the salon?
(A) $167.45
(B) $144.70
(C) $161.95
(D) $156.95
Simply add the amounts together: $32.50 + $112.20 + $17.25 = $161.95. Choice (C) is the cor-
rect answer.
13. Mailing the first ounce of a letter costs $0.39 and $0.24 to mail each additional ounce. How
much does it cost to mail a 5-ounce letter?
(A) $1.85
(B) $1.16
(C) $1.45
(D) $1.35
The first ounce costs $0.39. The next four ounces cost $0.24 each. Multiply $0.24 × 4 and then
add $0.39 to the product to determine how much mailing a 5-ounce letter costs: $0.24 × 4 =
$.96. $.96 + $0.39 = $1.35, the cost of mailing a 5-ounce letter. Choice (D) is the correct answer.

The remaining practice questions are straightforward math. You won’t have to wonder how
Terry got so much money to spend at the salon in the first place (like in the previous sec-
tion). Remember, these questions are designed for high school level and below. You won’t be
solving equations to calculate the orbit of Mars around the Sun here.
14. Which of the following fractions is the largest?
(A)
2⁄3
(B)
5⁄8
(C)
11⁄16
(D)
3⁄4
To arrive at the answer, find a common denominator that all the denominators divide evenly
into. In this case, the common denominator is 48 (multiply the smallest denominator by the
largest denominator — 16 × 3). Next, convert all fractions to 48ths. In the case of Choice (A),
multiply 2⁄3 × 16⁄16 to reach 32⁄48. Perform the same type of calculation for all the other fractions,
figuring out what number × the denominator gets 48, and then compare numerators. The
largest numerator is the largest fraction. Choice (D) is the correct answer.
15. What’s the product of √36 and √49?
(A) 1,764
(B) 42
(C) 13
(D) 6
The square root of 36 is 6 and the square root of 49 is 7. The product of those two numbers 
(6 × 7) is 42. The correct answer is Choice (B).
16. Solve for x: 2x – 3 = x + 7.
(A) 10
(B) 6
(C) 21
(D) -10
Isolate the xs on one side of the equation by subtracting x from both sides: 2x – 3 – x =
x + 7 – x, or x – 3 = 7. Continue to perform operations to isolate x. Add 3 to both sides of the
equation: x – 3 + 3 = 7 + 3, or x = 10. The correct answer is Choice (A).
17. A circle has a radius of 15 feet. What’s most nearly its circumference?
(A) 30 feet
(B) 225 feet
(C) 94 feet
(D) 150 feet
The circumference of a circle is π × diameter; the diameter equals two times the radius.
Therefore 30 × 3.14 = 94. The correct answer is Choice (C).

(D) 360 degrees
At 3:00 p.m., one hand is on the 12, and the other is on the 3. This creates a right angle — 
a 90-degree angle. The correct answer is Choice (A).
19. 23 × 24 =
(A) 16
(B) 108
(C) 128

23 × 24 = 27 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 128. Choice (C) is the correct answer.
20. Express 403,000,000,000,000 as scientific notation.
(A) 4.03 × 1014
(B) 4.03 × 10–14
(C) 403 × 10
(D) 0.43 × 10
Because the decimal point is moved 14 places to the left, the exponent is a positive number.
Choice (A) is the correct answer.
21. Simplify 8x2 – 3x + 4xy – 9x2 – 5x – 20xy
(A) 5x2 + 9xy
(B) 8x – 9x2
(C) –x2 – 8x – 16y
(D) 8x + 9x2
8x2 – 3x = 4xy – 9x2 – 5x – 20xy = (8x2 – 9x2) + (–3x – 5) + (4xy – 20xy) = –x2 – 8x – 16xy. The cor-
rect answer is Choice (C).
22. What’s the prime factorization of 90?
(A) 2 × 3 × 5
(B) 2 × 32 × 5
(C) 22 × 32 × 5

how much sugar does she have left?
(A) s + 50
(B) 50 – s
(C) s – 50
(D) s ÷ 50
s is the amount of sugar the baker had before she made the donuts. Taking away 50 pounds,
the amount of sugar used, gives you s – 50. Choice (C) is the correct answer.
25. Six pizzas are pepperoni, seven are hamburger, four are cheese, and three are “with every-

o get into the military, you have to know how to read

jobs, you also have to understand how the world works.
Several ASVAB subtests test your knowledge of science
and mechanics. Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered.
Part IV helps you review principles of science, auto and
shop information, mechanical comprehension, principles
of electronics, and spatial relationships. If you’re not inter-
ested in jobs that require this type of background (for a
list of jobs requiring this info, see the Appendix), you
don’t need to score high on these tests. But, if you’ve set
your heart on working on Humvees or F-18 Super Hornets,
you should study this part to get you started.

eneral Science is an area of study that requires a lot of straight-up memorization. 
If you don’t know that Earth is the third planet from the sun, then all the other science
knowledge you may have won’t help you one bit when the question asks, “Which planet is
the third planet from the sun?”
As you study for this subtest, you may feel overwhelmed with facts and figures. You’re pre-
sented with questions about facts you probably learned in high school in various science
classes, such as health, life sciences, biology, and chemistry classes. If you do feel a bit over-
whelmed, instead of trying to remember nine million individual facts, spend some time
reviewing the general principles behind the facts. Looking at the big picture is an effective
learning technique.
You have 11 minutes to answer 25 questions on the General Science subtest. That comes out
to about 26 seconds per question, so there’s no time to dilly dally. For the most part, you
either know the answer or you don’t. If you don’t know the answer, you can always guess
(check out Chapter 3 for tips on guessing on the ASVAB).
If you’ve read and worked through other chapters in this book, you’re probably tired of us
emphasizing that a particular subtest is important because the results are used in computing
the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score. Well, you can relax this time around. The
General Science subtest has no bearing on this score. On the other hand, your score on this
subtest is used to calculate some of the military composite scores that are used for job quali-
fication purposes (see the Appendix for more information).
So take some time to review the facts in this chapter as a mini science lesson. If the job you
want requires a good score on this subtest, you need to dedicate yourself to the information
in this chapter to boost your General Science score. You may also want to seek additional
study time in these excellent references to boost your science knowledge: Chemistry For
Dummies by John T. Moore, Biology For Dummies by Donna Rae Siegfried, Astronomy For

Everything in Its Place: Categorizing 
Mother Nature
A long time ago, scientists looked at the world, noticed the hundreds of thousands of plants
and animals around them, and decided that all these organisms needed to be labeled and
grouped. Thus, the system of scientific classification was developed.
In order to effectively study plants and animals, all scientists need to use the same names.
Using the same names keeps scientists from getting confused about what species is being
referred to.
The current day classification system was created by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeaus in
1757. Scientists often refer to this system as taxonomy. The Linnaean taxonomic system is
quite useful as a classification system. Not only does it provide official names for every plant
and animal, it also helps scientists understand how objects are related to one another.
Showing off your genus about the species
This scientific classification system notes the relationships and similarities among organ-
isms. Each organism is given a scientific name that consists of two words (usually derived
from Latin) — the genus and the species of the organism. The genus is the first word, and the
species is the second word in this name. Thus, Homo sapiens refers to humans. Canis famil-
iaris is the family dog, and Canis lupus is the family wolf. Because wolves and dogs share
many similarities, they share the same genus (no, no, not the same genes, the same genus).
When writing a scientific name, the genus name is capitalized, and the species name is all
lowercase. Both names are italicized.
No one is privy to the actual questions asked on the ASVAB (test materials are considered
“controlled items” and are locked up in safes when not in actual use). In this category, ques-
tions can range anywhere from “how many Kingdoms are there,” to “What’s the genus for
Canis familias?”
Counting down the classification system
The classification system consists of a total of seven levels:
 Kingdom: A kingdom is the broadest level. It contains the most kinds of organisms. The
relationship between organisms in a kingdom is extremely loose.
 Phylum: Phylum is the major taxonomic group of animals and plants. Within the king-
doms, organisms are divided by general characteristics. For example, in the Animal
Kingdom, animals with backbones are placed in a separate phylum from animals with-
out backbones.
 Class: Organisms in a phylum are divided into classes that further group similarities.
In the Animal Kingdom, for example, birds, mammals, and fish all group in their own
classes. Among plants, all flowering plants comprise the angiosperm class, and all
conifers, such as pines and spruces, comprise the conifer class.
 Order: Scientific groupings don’t follow hard and fast rules. After you get to the “order”
of a living thing, there’s disagreement about where it belongs. You may find that differ-
ent scientific organizations group creatures in different orders or families.
110
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

 Family: Families further divide organisms of the same class by similar characteristics.
Not all scientific organizations may agree to the exact family an organization should be
classified in.
 Genus: Two or more species that share unique body structures or other characteris-
tics are considered to be closely related and are placed together in a genus. Sometimes
a genus may include only a single species if there’s nothing else in the world that has
similarities with it.
 Species: A species is the most specific level. It contains the fewest organisms. The rela-
tionship between organisms in a species is very close.
In order to get a better idea of how the scientific classification system works, here’s how the
average lion is classified:
Kingdom Animalia: This kingdom includes all animals.
Phylum Chordata: All vertebrate animals belong to the Phylum Chordata.
Class Mammalia: All mammals belong to this class.
Order Carnivora: All mammals that eat meat belong to the Order Carnivora.
Family Felidae: The Family Felidae includes all cats.
Genus Panthera: This genus includes all the roaring cats, such as lions, tigers, jaguars,
and leopards.
Species Leo: Lion.
Although not every scientist agrees (scientists never agree on any subject), in general, most
lab-coated individuals settle on five as the number of kingdoms. Check out the organisms
that comprise the five kingdoms:
 Animals: One of the two largest kingdoms. Includes many-celled organisms that, unlike
plants, don’t have cellulose cell walls, chlorophyll, or the capacity to convert light into
energy (photosynthesis); members of this kingdom can move and respond to stimuli.
The Animal Kingdom includes more than 1,000,000 species.
 Plants: One of the two largest kingdoms. Includes organisms that can’t move, don’t
have obvious nervous or sensory systems, and possess cellulose cell walls. Over
250,000 species belong to the Plant Kingdom.
 Monerans and viruses: Includes bacteria and algae — one-celled organisms that don’t
have a nucleus. Viruses don’t have a true cell structure either — that’s why they’re
stuck in this kingdom. More than 10,000 species have been discovered and classified in
the Monera Kingdom.
 Protists: One-celled organisms that do have a nucleus like the protozoa (you may
remember from biology class). This kingdom consists of more than 250,000 species.
 Fungi: Complex, many-celled organisms that don’t photosynthesize (use light to create
energy) like plants. Mushrooms are the most famous fungi (they have a star on the
Fungi Walk of Fame). Over 100,000 species belong to the Fungi Kingdom.
There are 33 phyla that make up the animal kingdom, and 17 main phyla comprise the plant
kingdom. Monerans consist of three phyla; Protists have seven phyla, and Fungi are made 
up from four phyla. Numerous classes, orders, families, genera, and species fall under each
phylum.
Humans belong to the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata, the class Mammalia, the
order Primata, the family Hominidae, the genus Homo, and the species sapiens. You know,
just in case you were wondering.

Chapter 10: General Science

More vocabulary — nope, it never ends!
Just when you thought vocabulary study was over (because this section isn’t the Word
Knowledge subtest of the ASVAB), leave it to us to bring it up again. Many scientific words
come from Latin or Greek. If you know the meaning of the Latin or Greek word, you can often
figure out the meaning of the scientific word. Often, a Latin or Greek root word is used to
create a longer, more specific word. For more information on common word roots, see
Chapter 4.
For example, the Latin root homo means both human being and same. So Homo sapiens refer
to members of the human species, but homogeneous means of the same kind. So if you ran
across the word homologous on the General Science subtest, you’d know that it either has
something to do with humans or with things that are the same.
Take a look at the following example question:
Which of the following instruments might an oceanographer be expected to use?
(A) Aspirator
(B) Hydrophone
(C) Calorimeter
(D) Centrifuge
Even if you don’t have a clue about what any of these instruments do, if you know that hydro
relates to water, you’ve significantly increased your chances of getting the right answer.
Understanding the Forms of Measurement
Because science is based on developing objective facts — evidence and results that are
measurable and experiments that can be reproduced — measurements are an important part
of science. And because this subtest is all about general science, you can expect to run into a
few questions about measuring scientifically on the ASVAB.
Doing the metric thing
The metric system is based on a decimal system of multiples (and fractions) of ten. Scientists
almost always use the metric system for precise measurement. No, they don’t use it just to
make the ASVAB harder for you. Scientists use the metric system so a standard exists among
scientists around the world. In fact, the majority of countries around the globe use the metric
system — the U.S. is in its own world when it comes to the nonmetric system.
Here are some main ideas you need to remember for the General Science subtest of the
ASVAB:
 The meter is the unit of length.
 The liter is the unit of volume.
 The gram is the unit of weight.
Check out Tables 10-1 and 10-2 for more information.

Figuring temperature conversions
When you think of temperatures, you may consider different scales to figure temperatures in
degrees. Scientists actually use three different scales to report temperature:
 The Celsius scale (°C): This scale measures temperature, which is the metric standard
worldwide. On the Celsius scale, the freezing point (for water) is zero degrees and the
boiling point (for water) is 100 degrees.
 The Fahrenheit scale (°F): This scale is more common in the United States. On the
Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.
 The Kelvin scale: Scientists often use a third scale called the Kelvin scale. Scientists
have theorized that the absolute coldest it can get is minus 273.15 degrees Celsius.
Scientists believe at this temperature molecular motion would stop. That’s pretty darn
cold! This temperature is assigned to be zero on the Kelvin scale and is often called
absolute zero. On this scale, the freezing point of water is 273.15 K, and the boiling
point is 373.15 K.
113
Chapter 10: General Science

The word degrees isn’t used when stating temperature by Kelvin. Scientists who work
with thermodynamics, such as physicists and astronomers measure temperature using
Kelvin. In fact, surface temperature of planets is always stated in Kelvin.
There are times on the test you may be asked to convert temperatures from one scale to
another. So here are some equations to commit to memory:
 To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit use this formula:
F = 9⁄5 × (C + 32)
(C = temperature in degrees Celsius, and F = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit)
 To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius use the following formula:
C = 5⁄9 × (F – 32)
(C = temperature in degrees Celsius, and F = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit)
 To get temperatures in the Kelvin scale, you add 273.15 degrees to the Celsius tempera-
ture. And then you can convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.
Here’s a conversion system that may be easier to remember (Note: This process only works
with Celsius and Fahrenheit):
1. Add 40 to the temperature you want to convert.
2. Multiply this sum by 5⁄9 if converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius, or 9⁄5 if converting
from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. Subtract the 40 you added at the beginning to yield the result.
An easy way to remember whether to use 9⁄5 or 5⁄9 in the conversion is to associate the F in
Fahrenheit with “fraction” (5⁄9 is a fraction). But while 9⁄5 is also a fraction, it can also be con-
verted to a mixed number (14⁄5). This isn’t the case with 5⁄9.
There’s a Scientific Method to the Madness
Scientists are pretty skeptical and don’t necessarily believe anything said by anyone else
unless it’s been shown to be true (time after time after time) by using a process called the
Scientific Method. Scientists know that personal and cultural biases may influence percep-
tions and interpretations of data, so they’ve derived a standard set of procedures and criteria
to minimize those influences when developing a theory. Because the Scientific Method is
prevalent in all fields of science, you can expect to see a few questions about the process on
the General Science subtest.
The steps to solving a problem by using the Scientific Method are as follows:
1. Observe some aspect of the universe.
2. Make an educated guess about why this is happening.
Scientists call an educated guess a hypothesis.
3. Make predictions based on the hypothesis.
4. Experiment and observe to test the predictions.
If the results don’t match the predictions, modify the hypothesis.
5. Keep repeating Steps 3 and 4 until there are no discrepancies in experimentation
and observation in relation to the hypothesis.
114
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

When developing and testing a hypothesis, scientists are guided by a principle known as
Ockham’s Razor. This rule (sometimes spelled Occam’s razor), states, “When given two
equally valid explanations for a phenomenon, one should embrace the less complicated for-
mulation.” In other words, all things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best
one. At this point the hypothesis becomes a theory. When a theory is proven consistently
over time, scientists may then consider it as a law, fact, or principle.
Another Day, Another Science: Scientific
Disciplines You Should Know
Science comes in many sizes and colors. Some scientists concentrate their studies on plants,
some scientists study ocean life, and some scientists even study bugs. Yuck! Science is
divided into areas of studies called disciplines, and most of these disciplines have sub-disci-
plines. When you take the ASVAB, this subtest may ask you some definitions of these disci-
plines. We couldn’t possibly list all the scientific disciplines, but Table 10-3 is a handy chart
for you to start looking over and that you may run into on the ASVAB.
Table 10-3
Scientific Disciplines Covered on the ASVAB
Discipline
What It Means
Agriculture
An agriculturalist studies farming. That involves more than just driving tractors
around. The discipline includes studying different methods of cultivating soil, pro-
ducing crops, and managing livestock.
Archeology
An archeologist likes old things. In fact, the older the better. This scientist studies
past human life and culture. The job requires recovery and examination of mate-
rial evidence, such as graves, tools, pottery, and buildings.
Astronomy
Astronomers (not to be confused with astrologists) study outer space. They get
their jollies examining the existence, locations, orbits, energy, and composition of
planets and other celestial matter.
Biology
Biologists are the spice of life. They love everything to do with living organisms
and life sciences.
Botany
A botanist studies plant life. This examination includes everything from beautiful
flowers to the moss that grows on the north side of the tree.
Chemistry
Chemists like to mix things together to see what happens. These scientists study
the structure, properties, composition, and reactions of matter.
Ecology
Ecologists do more than just warn people that they’re destroying the ozone layer.
They study all aspects of the environment and how organisms (such as people)
interact with it.
Entomology
Entomologists like bugs. More specifically, they like insects (bugs with six legs).
This position isn’t to be confused with an arachnologist who studies spiders (bugs
with eight legs).
Genealogy
If you want to find out where your great, great, great, great, great Grandfather
was born, and what he did for a living, ask a genealogist. These specialists study
ancestry and family history.
Genetic
Geneticists tell you whether your children will have blue eyes and blonde hair and
how big their noses will be. Geneticists study heredity, especially the aspect that
deals with inherited characteristics.

Table 10-3 (continued)
Discipline
What It Means
Geology
Is it a real diamond or just a piece of rock? A geologist can tell you. These scien-
tists study the dynamics and physical history of the earth, the rocks of which it’s
composed, and the physical, chemical, and biological changes that the earth has
undergone or is undergoing.
Ichthyology
Ichthyologists like fish but not just to catch and eat. This discipline is the branch
of zoology (the study of animals) dealing with fish.
Meteorology
You know that person who gets on the TV each day and tells you whether your
planned outing to the beach is going to be ruined by rain? Meteorologists study
the weather and attempt to predict it.
Paleontology
Paleontologists study prehistoric life, including dinosaurs. How cool is that? The
science involves the examination of prehistoric fossils, including those of plants,
animals, and other organisms.
If the ASVAB only asked questions like “What does a chemist do?”, the test would be a piece
of organic matter (cake). Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. The ASVAB expects you to know a
little more than just the definitions of various scientific disciplines. The following sections
detail a few of the main branches of science you’ll see on the ASVAB.
Uncovering biology, from big to small
There are more disciplines of biology than you can shake a stick at. And, yes, some biologists
study sticks. Other biologists specialize in fish; some love looking at trees; some spend all
their time studying insects; some biologists get excited thinking about snakes . . . you get the
picture.
It would be impossible to cover all the areas of biology in this book, and we’re not even going
to try. Luckily, the General Science subtest of the ASVAB measures your knowledge of scien-
tific disciplines at the average high school level. You remember studying about the human
body and cell structures in high school, right? If not, the following sections can serve as your
short refresher course.
Perusing the human body systems
Your body consists of major systems that work together to keep you alive. (And staying alive
is a good thing, so be sure to thank your circulatory system and all the rest!) These systems
include those listed in Table 10-4.

Thinking small: A look at cell structures
Most living things (except for those pesky viruses and a few other odds and ends) are made
up of cells that share certain characteristics. Cells come in different sizes and shapes
depending on what they do. In the human body, a muscle cell looks very different from a
brain cell. (Has all this talk of cells caused your brain cells to hurt yet?) Cells combine to
create other structures like tissues, bones, and skin.
Here are a few terms to remember:
 A cell has two main parts — the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
• The nucleus controls cellular activity. It’s like the brains behind the cell.
• The cytoplasm is a gel-like substance, composed mostly of water, inside the cell
membrane and outside the nucleus. Cytoplasm contains many chemicals that
carry out the life processes in the cell.
 A thin cell membrane protects the nucleus and cytoplasm.
See Figure 10-1 for a description of other cell structures.
Pointing out cell differences
Plant cells differ from animal cells in a number of ways:
 Plant cells have a firm cell wall that supports and protects the cell. Animal cells don’t
have such a structure.
 Plant cells have larger vacuoles (storage areas) than those found in animal cells.
 Many plant cells contain chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, a chemical that helps
plants create food with the help of sunlight. Animals don’t have chloroplasts.
 Animal cells contain centrioles (cylindrical structures). Plant cells don’t.
 Animal cells have lysosomes (sacs of enzymes), which aren’t found in typical plant
cells.
117
Chapter 10: General Science

Profiting from cell processes
Cells perform various processes in order to function at an optimum level. Here are a few of
these processes:
 Metabolism: Chemical reactions causing the creation and destruction of complex 
molecules
 Osmosis: Movement of water through the cell membrane
 Phagocytosis: Acquisition of particles of material from outside of the cell; accom-
plished by surrounding the particles and passing them through the cell membrane
 Photosynthesis: Conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen 
(in plants); in other words, sunlight is used to create energy
 Respiration: Elimination of waste materials at the cellular level
Swimming in the gene pool: Genetics
Someday you’re going to find yourself acting like your mother or father. Whether you like it
or not, it’s inevitable because parents pass their traits on to their offspring. Understanding
genetics (how these traits are passed from parents to offspring and what happens when the
process goes wrong) helps scientists pinpoint the causes of diseases and disorders and can
help them develop treatments and cures.
1. Chloroplast: Contains chlorophyll,
      which produces food
2. Cell wall: Protects the cell
3. Nucleus: The “brain” of the cell
4. Chromatin: Thin fibers
      containing genes
5. Nucleoplasm: Protoplasm (living
      material) in the nucleus
6. Ribosome: Combines amino acids
      into proteins
7. Cytoplasm: The cell’s factory
8. Mitochondria: Produce the energy
      for cellular activity

      material within it

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

In human genetics, a healthy fetus contains 23 pairs of chromosomes (the bodies that actually
contain the genes). The mother and the father each supply one chromosome per pair. Genes
contained on the chromosomes determine many characteristics of the resulting child.
When cells multiply to produce tissues and organs (and eventually a complete living thing),
they reproduce their genetic material. Sometimes this process doesn’t work perfectly, and a
genetic “mistake” is made. This mishap frequently results in a fetus that doesn’t live or in a
fetus with a genetic disease or disorder. For example, Down’s Syndrome is the result of a
fetus having 47 instead of 46 chromosomes.
Most cells reproduce by mitosis, a process in which two identical cells are formed from one
parent cell. However, sex cells (eggs and sperm), reproduce differently. Through meiosis,
each sex cell divides and contains only half the number of chromosomes as a nonsex cell.
This process takes place so that the sex cells of one person (with 23 chromosomes) can
hook up with the sex cells of another person (with 23 chromosomes) to produce 46 chromo-
somes or 23 pairs. Otherwise, way too many chromosomes would be floating around.
Determining your gender with two little letters
The genes on one pair of chromosomes, called the sex chromosomes, determine whether the
resultant child will be male or female. In females, the two sex chromosomes are alike, and
they’re labeled XX. In males, the chromosomes are different and are labeled XY.
The child always receives an X chromosome from the mother. The father can contribute
either an X or a Y chromosome. So papa actually determines the sex of the child.
Knowing which genes get passed down the family line
Many characteristics that you possess (from the way your nose turns up at the end to the
color of your eyes) are determined by a pair of genes. These genes may be alike, or they may
not. Some genes are dominant and some genes are recessive. If you have two unalike genes,
the characteristic that they produce comes from the dominant gene. The gene that doesn’t
dominate is called the recessive gene. But because each parent contributes a gene to the off-
spring, each parent may contribute a recessive gene to the child, which then gives the child
the recessive characteristic, even if both parents showed the dominant characteristic. Whew!
Relating to your world through ecology
Ecology is the study of the environment — more specifically, the relationship between organ-
isms and the world around them. All plants and animals are part of an ecosystem (a commu-
nity including living things and the environment around them). An ecosystem includes
producers and consumers (a lot like the economy). An ecosystem also has decomposers, like
bacteria, which the economy doesn’t have.
Conditions in the world either encourage or prevent the establishment of individual ecosys-
tems. For plants (producers) to grow, adequate sunlight, good soil, moderate temperatures,
and water must be part of the environment. Without these factors in place, plants can’t grow.
If plants aren’t around, plant-eating consumers can’t be sustained, which means predators
(who eat other animals) can’t be sustained either.
For consumers (a category that includes predators as well as plant-eating consumers), mates
are as essential as a food supply. Diseases and enemies can prevent an animal from establish-
ing itself in an ecosystem. An ecosystem can be disrupted or destroyed by wasting natural
resources and by polluting the air, water, and/or soil.
119
Chapter 10: General Science

Animals can’t produce their own food, and they’re classified in three categories:
 Carnivores eat only meat. A few examples include lions, tigers, polar bears, snakes,
crocodiles, hawks, and eagles.
 Herbivores eat only plants. Cows, moose, giraffes, and elk are herbivores.
 Omnivores eat both plants and other animals. People are omnivores, and so are pigs,
mice, raccoons, chickens, crows, and foxes.
Chemistry: How not to blow up the lab
Those mad scientists in the movies always seem to be chemists, but that doesn’t seem quite
right because chemistry shouldn’t drive you crazy. Here’s a straightforward review of the
chemistry you need to know for the General Science subtest.
Everything that has mass and takes up space, including your old Chevy that’s up on blocks
and the mosquito buzzing around the room, is matter. And all matter is made up of basic 
substances — building blocks — called elements.
Mass isn’t the same thing as weight. Weight has to do with the force gravity exerts on mass. If
you were in a gravity-free zone, you wouldn’t weigh anything, but you’d still be there, so
you’d still exist and have mass.
Understanding the elements, my dear Watson
Elements can be broken into small parts. The atom is the smallest part of an element that still
retains the characteristics of that element. Every atom has particles — pieces of matter so
small they have no magnitude. Electrons are negatively charged particles that float around
the atom’s nucleus, or core, which is made up of neutrons (particles with no charge) and pro-
tons (positively charged particles). If an atom has one proton in its nucleus, it has the atomic
number 1. Each element has its own atomic number.
Hydrogen is the only element with just one proton in its nucleus, so it has the atomic 
number 1. Magnesium, which has 12 protons in its nucleus, is given the atomic number 12.
Atoms can combine with each other to form molecules. Elements can combine with each
other to form compounds, which consist of two or more different elements. A compound can
have very different properties from the elements that make it up. For example, table salt,
which is mostly harmless, consists of two lethal elements — sodium and chlorine — but,
when combined, make a compound that people ingest every day.
Sitting down at the periodic table
The periodic table (also known as the table of elements) classifies all elements (scientists love
to classify things). Elements are listed according to their atomic numbers and are arranged
into families of similar elements. The table of elements (see Figure 10-2) lists the atomic
number, the abbreviation for the element, and its atomic weight, which is the mass of one
atom of the element.
Looking at Figure 10-2, you can see that copper (Cu, atomic number 29), for example, has an
atomic weight of 63.55, which means that copper is much, much heavier than helium (He,
atomic number 2), which has an atomic weight of 4.
You don’t have to memorize these charts to do well on the ASVAB, but you should know the
atomic numbers for common elements such as hydrogen, helium, mercury, carbon, copper,
gold, iron, lead, nitrogen, oxygen, plutonium, sodium, and uranium.

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

Changing states
Particles of matter are always in motion. How much kinetic energy (motion energy) a particle
has determines whether the matter is a solid, liquid, or gas in its normal state. Gas particles
move around very quickly; liquid particles move more slowly, and solid particles move much
more slowly than either of the other two.
When heat or cold is applied to matter, the kinetic energy of the matter changes; therefore,
the nature of the substance can change. Heat applied to water changes the water from a
liquid to a gas (steam), and cold applied to water changes it from a liquid to a solid (ice).
Particles of matter no longer move at absolute zero (–273°C or –459°F).
Causing a chemical reaction
Matter may change from one state to another (like from liquid to solid) through the applica-
tion of cold or heat. When these physical changes occur, the molecule itself remains the
same. For example, water is still made of hydrogen and oxygen, no matter what state it’s in.
However, chemical reactions create molecules of new matter. Here’s an example: When iron
rusts, a chemical change occurs. The rust isn’t the same molecule as the iron.
In a chemical reaction, two subjects are present:
 Reactants: The elements, molecules, or compounds involved in the reaction
 Products: The elements, molecules, or compounds that result from the chemical 
reaction
Where few have gone before: Astronomy
Earth’s solar system consists of the sun and a number of smaller bodies (such as asteroids),
planets, and moons that the sun’s mass holds in orbit. The sun’s mass creates gravity, and
this gravity controls the movements of the smaller bodies.

Chapter 10: General Science

The sun
The sun is the largest and most important object in the solar system. It contains 99.8 percent
of the solar system’s mass (quantity of matter). The sun provides most of the heat, light, and
other energy that makes life possible.
The sun’s outer layers are hot and stormy. The hot gases and electrically charged particles in
those layers continually stream into space and often burst out in solar eruptions. This flow of
gases and particles forms the solar wind, which bathes everything in the solar system.
The sun is much larger than Earth. From the sun’s center to its surface, it’s about 109 times
the radius of Earth. Some of the streams of gas rising from the solar surface are even larger
than Earth.
The planets
Astronomers define a planet as “a non-luminous celestial body larger than an asteroid or
comet, illuminated by light from a star, around which it revolves.” The solar system consists
of nine known planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and
Pluto.
The Earth revolves around the sun in an oval-shaped pattern called an ellipse. Every 3651⁄4
days, the Earth completes its orbit around the sun and starts again. The Earth rotates (spins)
on its axis and completes a rotation every 24 hours, but because of the tilt of the Earth,
hours of daylight and darkness aren’t equal, except for two days a year.
The inner four planets consist chiefly of iron and rock. They are known as the terrestrial
(earthlike) planets because they’re somewhat similar in size and composition. The outer
planets, except for Pluto, are giant worlds with thick, gaseous outer layers. Almost all their
mass consists of hydrogen and helium, giving them compositions more like that of the sun
than that of Earth. Beneath their outer layers, the giant planets have no solid surfaces. 
The pressure of their thick atmospheres turns their insides liquid, though they may have
rocky cores.
Rings of dust, rock, and ice chunks encircle all the giant planets. Saturn’s rings are the most
familiar, but thin rings also surround Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.
Until August 2006, Pluto was referred to as the ninth planet since its discovery in the 1930s.
But Pluto has so many unusual features that recently it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. For
example, it travels around the sun in an elongated oval path much different from the nearly
circular orbits of the other planets. And unlike the other outer planets, Pluto is small and
solid and contains only 1⁄500 the mass of Earth.
122
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 
Is Pluto really a planet?
In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union
(IAU) established a new definition for the word planet.
Under the new standards, Pluto is no longer considered
a planet but instead is classified as a dwarf planet.
According to the planet definition, currently the solar
system consists of eight planets and three dwarf plan-
ets. The definition doesn’t apply outside the solar system
and doesn’t include provision for extra-solar planets. The
definition was a controversial one and has been both
criticized and supported by different astronomers.
Remember, though, the ASVAB was last revised long
before the IAU decision, so if you see a question on the
ASVAB, asking how many planets there are in the solar
system, the correct answer would be nine.

Moons
Moons (sometimes called satellites) orbit all the planets except Mercury and Venus. The
moon you refer to as the moon revolves around the earth. It makes a complete revolution
every 271⁄3 days. When the moon moves into the earth’s shadow, a lunar eclipse results — the
earth is positioned between the sun and the moon. When the earth moves into the moon’s
shadow, a solar eclipse results — the moon is positioned between the earth and the sun.
The inner planets have few moons. The giant planets probably have more small moons not
yet discovered. See Table 10-5 for a lineup of the planets and their moons. Note: Although
Pluto is no longer officially considered a planet, the current version of the ASVAB was written
before this decision was made. That’s why Pluto is included in Table 10-5.

The largest moon (Charon) is more than half the size of Pluto.
Jupiter’s four largest moons are known as the Galilean satellites because the Italian
astronomer Galileo discovered them in 1610 with one of the first telescopes. The largest
Galilean satellite — and the largest satellite in the solar system — is Ganymede, which is
even bigger than Mercury and Pluto. The largest of Saturn’s moons, Titan, has an atmosphere
thicker than Earth’s and a diameter larger than that of Mercury or Pluto.
Meteors, comets, and asteroids
A meteor is a fiery rock from space that hits Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in a brief streak
of light. It’s often called a shooting star. When a meteor enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it usu-
ally burns up, and that’s a good thing. If a meteor actually lands on the ground, it’s called a
meteorite.
Comets are snowballs composed mainly of ice and rock. When a comet approaches the sun,
some of the ice in its nucleus (center) turns into gas. The gas shoots out of the sunlit side of
the comet. The solar wind then carries the gas outward, forming it into a long tail.
Astronomers divide comets into two main types:
 Long-period comets, which take 200 years or more to orbit the sun.
 Short-period comets, which complete their orbits in fewer than 200 years.
123
Chapter 10: General Science

The most famous of all comets, Halley’s Comet — also referred to as Comet Halley after
Edmond Halley — is a comet that can be seen every 75 to 76 years, making it a short-period
comet. Halley is the only short-period comet that’s visible to the naked eye and will return
within a human lifetime. Its many appearances over the centuries have had a notable effect
on human history. Halley’s Comet last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and will
next appear in mid 2061.
Asteroids are minor planets. Some have elliptical orbits that pass inside the orbit of Earth or
even that of Mercury. Others travel on a circular path among the outer planets. Most aster-
oids circle the sun in a region called the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
The belt contains more than 200 asteroids larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) in diameter.
Scientists estimate that more than 750,000 asteroids exist in the belt with diameters larger
than 3⁄5 mile (1 kilometer). There are millions of smaller asteroids, and astronomers have even
found several large asteroids with smaller asteroids orbiting them.
Adding a dash of geology and meteorology
The study of the physical makeup of the earth is often called earth science. Geology describes
the earth’s physical appearance and meteorology explains the earth’s atmosphere.
Peeling back the layers
The earth is like an onion that consists of several layers. The crust is the earth’s surface, and
it varies in depth from a few miles to 30 miles. The mantle, the solid rock below the crust,
makes up most of the mass of the earth. The core is the earth’s fiery center, with a tempera-
ture estimated to reach 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius (to see what that is in Fahrenheit,
check out the conversion equations in “Figuring temperature conversions” earlier in this
chapter). The mantle prevents this heat from escaping and causing all the plants to wilt.
Sometimes cracks in the earth’s crust, called faults, appear. When the land shifts along these
faults, earthquakes result. When rocks in the mantle are heated to liquid, they become
magma. Upon reaching the earth’s surface, magma becomes lava, which forms volcanoes.
Checking outta this world
The earth’s atmosphere also contains many layers of air surrounding the earth’s surface.
Starting with the layer closest to the earth and extending outward, here are those layers:
 Troposphere: Extends 5 to 10 miles above the earth. Sometimes called the jet stream,
this layer is where almost all weather changes occur.
 Stratosphere: Extends about 30 miles. The reported main cause of ozone depletion is
the presence of chlorofluorocarbons in the Earth’s stratosphere. These molecules
undergo a series of chain reactions, which ultimately lead to the destruction of the
ozone layer.
 Mesosphere: Extends about 50 miles. Millions of meteors burn up daily in the mesos-
phere as a result of collisions with the gas particles contained there.
 Ionosphere: Extends about 70 miles. This layer reflects radio waves, making it impor-
tant to communications.
Scientists disagree among themselves as to whether the ionosphere is a separate
atmospheric layer.
 Thermosphere: Extends about 350 miles. The International Space Station has a stable
orbit within the upper part of the thermosphere, between 320 and 380 kilometers.
 Exosphere: Extends about 40,000 miles. It’s only from the exosphere that atmospheric
gases, atoms, and molecules can escape into outer space. Many scientists call the exos-
phere an extension of the thermosphere.

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

Warming up to cold fronts
When the sun shines, land and water absorb its warmth. Land warms faster than water, so
air over land is warmer than air over water. At night, the air is cooler over land than water,
affecting air density (density has to do with how closely packed the air molecules are). The
angle of the sun (the sun shines directly over the equator, but not the poles) also affects air
density.
Cold air is denser than warm air. Because it’s denser, cold air has high pressure, compared to
warm air’s low pressure. (A barometer measures this atmospheric pressure.) Air moves from
areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, creating wind.
Air masses have certain characteristics depending on where they form. If an air mass forms
over land, it’s dry, and if it forms over water, it’s wet. Air masses formed in the northern and
southern regions are cold, and those formed at the equator are warm. When two different air
masses meet, they don’t mix. They form a boundary called a front. When cold air meets warm
air, a cold front develops. The warm air in the cold front may be pushed up to form clouds,
causing heavy rain. When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, a warm front develops. The
warm air passes over the cold air, forming a different kind of cloud, which causes light rain.
Classifying clouds
Clouds are made of small droplets of water or bits of ice that are spread out from each other.
Rain (or snow) falls when the drops get too big and heavy to stay in the cloud. Clouds have
three main types, and the ASVAB may ask you a question or two about their characteristics,
which are detailed in Table 10-6.
Table 10-6
Types of Clouds
Cloud Type
Description
What It Forecasts
Cirrus
Thin, feathery, high clouds
Generally indicate rain or snow.
Cumulus
Flat bottoms and round tops
Common during fair weather, but when they
darken, they cause heavy rains.
Stratus
Broad, flat, and low hanging
When they’re dark, rain usually occurs.
Additionally, a prefix or suffix is frequently given to the cloud name to indicate what level of
the atmosphere it’s in or whether it’s producing precipitation:
 Cirro is the prefix given to high clouds (base above 20,000 feet).
 Alto is the prefix given to mid-level clouds (base between 6,000 and 20,000 feet).
 Nimbo added to the beginning or nimbus added to the end of a cloud name means the
cloud is producing precipitation.
Therefore, a cirrocumulus cloud is a cloud with a flat bottom and round top at high altitude.
Altostratus clouds are broad, flat clouds at mid altitude.
Employing Strategies for this Part of the Test
Even if you study hard for the General Science subtest, chances are you may come across at
least a couple of questions that you can’t answer. That’s the nature of this subtest — it pretty
much asks you to know all there is to know about the world. Face it: Even Einstein wouldn’t
get every answer right. However, you can use several strategies to improve your chances of
selecting the correct answer, and these strategies are outlined in the following sections.
125
Chapter 10: General Science

If you don’t know the answer to a question right off the bat, don’t panic. You can often elimi-
nate a few bad choices simply based on common sense. Even if you can’t determine the only
answer, keep in mind that this subtest doesn’t penalize you for guessing, so guessing makes
sense — you have a 25 percent chance of guessing right even if you can’t eliminate any obvi-
ously wrong answers. If you can eliminate just one wrong answer, you improve your chances
to 33 percent.
Although the General Science subtest is a timed test, most people don’t have to rush to finish
it, but then again, you don’t have that much leisure time to stop and think about all the ques-
tions at length, either. So, if you don’t know the answer to a question right away, do your best
to quickly eliminate wrong answers, mark your best guess, and move along. For more help on
making these eliminating decisions check out Chapter 3.
Try the process of elimination in the following question:
The knee joint is known as a
(A) pivot joint
(B) fixed joint
(C) ball-and-socket joint
(D) hinge joint
Looking at the choices, you can eliminate Choice (B), fixed joint, because your knee isn’t
fixed or not moveable (or, if it is, it shouldn’t be). Your skull is an example of a fixed joint, but
that’s irrelevant to this question. Is your knee a pivot joint? If you think of something that
pivots, you think of it moving in a circular or at least a semi-circular, manner. Your knee 
doesn’t do that either; therefore, you can safely eliminate Choice (A). A ball-and-socket joint
is one that permits limited movement in any direction. (Your shoulder joint is a ball-and-
socket joint.) Your knee doesn’t do that. So you can strike off Choice (C) and choose Choice
(D), hinge joint, as the most likely answer. Your knee moves like a door on a hinge.
Now suppose you have a question like this:
The most common gas found in Earth’s atmosphere is
(A) oxygen
(B) nitrogen
(C) calcium
(D) helium
Eliminate Choice (C) because calcium isn’t a gas. You can also cross out Choice (D) because
if helium were the most common gas, everyone would be talking in squeaky voices (you
know, like sucking helium from a balloon). Eliminating these two answers leaves you with
just two choices, and if you simply guessed, you’d have a 50 percent chance of being right.
Unfortunately, most people would guess that oxygen is the most common gas in Earth’s
atmosphere, but they’d be wrong. Nitrogen — Choice (B) — tops the list, making up 78 per-
cent of the atmosphere.

ver wonder why automobile mechanics and carpenters charge you about a billion dol-
lars an hour when you need to hire their services? Because if the jobs were easy, every-
one would do them.
Fortunately, in order to do well on the Auto & Shop Information subtest of the ASVAB, you
won’t have to get your hands greasy or chance hitting your thumb with a hammer. The ques-
tions on this subtest are pretty basic. Automotive questions usually ask about basic automo-
tive systems and malfunctions. The shop questions generally ask you to identify a tool or
fastener, or the purpose of such.
The Auto & Shop Information subtest consists of 25 questions. Happily, the ASVAB gurus give
you 26.4 seconds to answer each question (11 minutes total). About one-half of the questions
measure your basic knowledge of automotive principles and one-half queries you about shop
tools and basic shop principles. On this subtest you either know the answer, or you don’t,
but sometimes basic common sense can come into play. For example, if a car stalls when the
needle of the gas gauge is resting on “E,” the most probable cause of the malfunction is obvi-
ous. Well, obvious to most people, that is. Rod’s daughters may argue with this statement.
The military only uses the Auto & Shop Information subtest to determine your qualifications
for certain jobs. It’s not used in the calculation of your AFQT score. Turn to the Appendix at
the back of this book to find the jobs that require a good score on this subtest. If you don’t
need to do well on this subtest to qualify for the kind of job you want, you may be better off
studying for a different part of the ASVAB.
Checking Under the Hood
Contrary to what you may think, an automobile is much more than the mechanical monster
you park in your driveway each night that both you and the bank own. It’s actually a complex
machine that has undergone over a century of evolution. Henry Ford would probably have a
stroke if he could see what his simple horseless carriage evolved into today.
The modern car is divided into several primary and secondary systems. These systems are
covered in the next few sections.

Engine
How does an engine work? You turn the key, and if it doesn’t start, you call your mechanic or
your dad, right? Well, not quite. The internal combustion engine burns a mixture of gas and
air. Burning gas and air (the fuel mixture) makes the fuel mixture expand quickly (explode).
The pressure from this explosion is transferred to the wheels to make the car move.
The movement is brought about by a cycle, which your car’s engine repeats a zillion and one
times. Figure 11-1 illustrates how this process works:
1. During the intake stroke, an explosive mixture of fuel and air enters a cylinder
through the intake valve.
The intake valve knows when to open because it is attached to a pushrod, which is con-
nected to the crankshaft of the engine. The crankshaft is discussed in further detail
below.
Engines in cars have more than one cylinder. Generally cars have an even number of
cylinders — four, six, or eight. These cylinders are arranged in a row or rows, which are
called inline (one row) or V (two rows) depending on how the cylinders are arranged.
2. A piston, located within the cylinder, compresses the fuel and air mixture during
the compression stroke.
This increase in pressure makes the mixture extremely explosive.
3. At the point of maximum compression, a spark plug emits (you guessed it) a spark,
igniting the fuel and air mixture.
The pressure from the burning gas and air moves the piston. This is referred to as the
power stroke.

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

4. The piston, which is connected (by a connecting rod) to a crankshaft, turns the
crankshaft.
The crankshaft is connected to the flywheel at the rear of the engine. Only one crank-
shaft is present, even with multiple cylinders. But the crankshaft has more than one
crank (in fact, it has exactly as many cranks as the engine has cylinders).
5. The flywheel, once properly motivated, continues revolving (using momentum)
between pushes from the crankshaft.
The flywheel keeps the engine going.
6. The crankshaft forces the piston back to the top of its stroke, while at the same time
moves a pushrod, opening the exhaust valve so that the exploded gases can escape
the cylinder.
Most people refer to their engines as a four-cycle engine. This isn’t really true. It is a four-
stroke, one cycle engine, including the intake stroke, compression stroke, power stroke, and
exhaust stroke that are one engine cycle. When the fourth stroke is completed, the cycle
begins again. Automobile engines do this very fast. When the tachometer (an instrument
measuring revolutions per minute [rpm]) on your dashboard shows 4,800 rpm, for example,
that means the engine is performing 4,800 of these cycles every minute.
In order for the cycle to happen at all, fuel must be properly mixed with air and transported
within the cylinder at the proper time. Various components perform this function:
 Carburetors are used on most older cars (pre-1990) to mechanically mix the fuel and air.
As air moves faster through the carburetor, it creates a vacuum which draws more and
more fuel into the mixture.
 Fuel injectors have replaced carburetors on newer cars to perform the air/fuel mixture
function. Actually, fuel injectors have been around since the late 1950s, but weren’t
widely introduced until the late 80s and early 90s. The fuel injector acts as the fuel-dis-
pensing nozzle. It injects liquid fuel directly into the engine’s air stream. In almost all
cases this requires an external pump.
129
Chapter 11: Auto & Shop Information
Octane ratings
Octane ratings measure gasoline’s ability to resist
engine knock, a rattling or pinging sound that results
from premature ignition of the compressed fuel-air mix-
ture in one or more cylinders. Most gas stations offer
three octane grades: regular (usually 87 octane), mid-
grade (usually 89 octane) and premium (usually 92 or 93).
By federal law, the ratings must be posted on bright
yellow stickers on each gasoline pump.
The octane rating correlates to how much the gasoline
can be compressed before it ignites spontaneously.
When gasoline ignites this way, instead of by the spark
of a spark plug, the engine begins knocking. That’s not a
good thing because early ignition can cause engine
damage over time.
But, don’t be fooled — that doesn’t mean using higher
octane gas is better. In most cases, using a higher
octane gasoline than your owner’s manual recommends
offers absolutely no benefit. It won’t make your car per-
form better, go faster, get better mileage, or run cleaner.
The only time you might need to switch to a higher
octane level is if your car engine knocks when you use
the recommended fuel. This occurrence happens to a
small percentage of cars. Buying higher octane gasoline
is a waste of money, too. Premium gas costs 15 to 20
cents per gallon more than regular. That can add up to
$100 or more a year in extra costs.
How can you tell if you’re using the right octane level?
Listen to your car’s engine. If it doesn’t knock when you
use the recommended octane, you’re using the right
grade of gasoline.

A doodad called the EFI computer (Electronic Fuel Injection computer) determines the
amount of fuel entering the engine. Just as your brain takes in information from your
five senses and processes it, so does the EFI computer. It receives information from the
sensors in the fuel, air and exhaust system and from that information, it determines
how much fuel the engine needs to operate at optimum levels.
 A throttle is mechanically connected to the carburetor (on older cars) and electroni-
cally connected to the EFI computer (on newer cars). Advancing (opening) the throttle
causes more fuel to be transferred to the carburetor or the fuel injectors.
 The accelerator (the gas pedal) is connected to the throttle by mechanical linkages. The
harder you push on the gas pedal, the farther the throttle is advanced (opened). Thus,
more fuel is transported to the carburetor or fuel injectors.
Cooling system
Because of the high temperature at which the fuel burns, the engine has a cooling system
(otherwise the engine would melt). Here’s how the process works:
1. Water jackets surround the parts that reach the highest temperatures.
2. The water pump circulates water through the jackets.
3. While the water circulates, it heats up and then passes through the radiator, where
outside air cools the water.
4. The water in the system is usually mixed with coolant (antifreeze).
This mixture raises the boiling point of the water (which keeps the water from boiling
away), as well as its freezing point (which keeps the system from freezing up during
cold weather.
In addition, the engine parts must be lubricated to prevent them from breaking down, 
which occurs if the metal parts are allowed to rub against each other. An oil pump circu-
lates oil through the engine; oil flows through the crankshaft and connecting rods, 
lubricating as it goes.
Electrical and ignition systems
Your car requires more than just gasoline to operate. It also needs a supply of electricity. 
In the old days, automotive electrical systems operated on six volts. Shortly after World 
War II, as electrical accessories became more prevalent in automobiles, 12 volts became the
standard.
An electric motor powered by the battery starts the engine when you turn the key. This
motor is called a starter (for obvious reasons). A gizmo called an alternator sends an electric
current back to the battery to keep the battery charged and also powers the other electronic
gadgets on your car when the engine is running.
The ignition system supplies a high-voltage current to the spark plugs to ignite the fuel mix-
ture in the cylinders. (See the section entitled, “Engine,” earlier in this chapter.) The system
takes the 12-volt current from the battery, steps it up to about 20,000 volts, and then sends
the current to the spark plugs.
In older cars, this increase of voltage is accomplished by means of a device called a coil,
which uses electromagnetic induction to step up the voltage. The current then passes
through an electrical/mechanical switching device called a distributor. A rotating shaft and a
switch within the distributor, called breaker points, routes the current through wires to the
130
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

spark plugs. A condenser absorbs excess current and protects the breaker points from
damage by the high-voltage surge. The distributor and other devices control the timing of
the spark-plug discharges.
In the 1970s, the electronic ignition systems were introduced. In modern ignition systems,
the distributor, coil, points, and condenser have been replaced by solid-state electronics con-
trolled by a computer. A computer controls the ignition system and adjusts it to provide max-
imum efficiency in a variety of driving conditions.
Drive system
Having a working engine is all fine and dandy, but the power of the engine still has to be
transferred to the wheels to make them move. This is the job of the drive system. Cars have
drive systems that run on axles. The axle is the shaft on which the wheels revolve. The uni-
versal joint allows the axle to move up and down without breaking the drive shaft. Gears on
the axle allow the vehicle to make turns. Axle shafts turn the wheels. The wheels on vehicles
turn in three different ways:
 Rear-wheel drive: The rear wheels push the car. The drive shaft extends from the
transmission to the rear axle.
 Front-wheel drive: The front wheels pull the car. The drive shaft extends from the
transmission to the front axle.
 All-wheel drive (four-wheel-drive): All wheels push and pull the car at the same time.
The drive shaft extends from the transmission to both axles.
Cars also have transmissions. The transmission changes the speed of the engine in relation to
the speed of the rear wheels (in rear-wheel-drive), the front wheels (in front-wheel-drive), or
all the wheels (in four-wheel or all-wheel-drive). Vehicles have two types of transmissions:
automatic and manual (stick shift).
The transmission consists of gears in several combinations so that the amount of torque
used can vary according to needs. When the terrain is difficult (as in snow), the wheels need
more torque (the force that produces rotation) in order to move. The transmission increases
torque as needed. In an automatic transmission, this variation is done automatically by the
torque converter. In a manual transmission, the driver shifts the gears by hand. The clutch is
used to facilitate this process; it also allows the engine to run when the car isn’t moving.
Brake system
When a vehicle is in motion, brakes are applied to stop that car from moving. (A long way
from the time when Fred and Barney stopped their car by dragging their heels.) Today’s
brake system process is a detailed one:
1. Each wheel has a brake that applies friction to the wheel to stop its rotation.
2. A drum brake consists of a master cylinder that has brake lines (filled with brake
fluid) running from it.
3. The brake pedal applies pressure to the master cylinder, which sends pressure
(and brake fluid) through the lines.
4. The lines are connected to a hydraulic cylinder on each wheel.
This cylinder contains pistons that move outward and force two brake shoes against a
metal drum that rotates the wheel. Usually, two independent systems are used; one
governs the front wheels and the other controls the rear wheels.
131
Chapter 11: Auto & Shop Information

5. A disc-brake system consists of master cylinder that forces a caliper, with brake
shoes on each side, to squeeze against a rotating disc in each wheel, thus stopping
your car.
Emissions-control systems 
(in layman’s terms, filters)
Think of the engine as a giant cigarette and the emissions-control system as a filter. The
exhaust from automobiles emits pollutants, including carbon monoxide. These pollutants are
a result of the combustion process (or they’re partially combusted fuel or unburned fuel). 
To prevent these pollutants from poisoning the atmosphere, manufacturers place emissions-
control systems on cars. These systems include
 Positive-crankcase ventilation: An old method (still in use) that forces unburned or
partially burned fuel back into the cylinder so the fuel can be burned
 Air-injection systems: Systems that force air into the engine’s exhaust system to burn
unburned or partially burned fuel before the fuel comes out the exhaust pipe
 Catalytic converter: Oxidizes hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide into water vapor
and carbon dioxide (the same thing people exhale). This system doesn’t control other
types of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides.
 Exhaust-gas-recirculation system: Helps control nitrogen-oxide emissions by forcing
some of the gases back into the cylinders
Picking Up the Tools of the Trade
You’ve probably heard the phrase, “the right tool for the right job.” This comment is what
Dad used to yell at you when you’d use a Phillips screwdriver to punch holes in oil cans
(thereby getting oil on your shirt). The ASVAB folks also believe in using the right tool for the
right job, and many of the questions on the Auto & Shop subtest ask you to identify the best
tool for certain tasks.
Tools are easiest to understand when you classify them by their function, so the following
sections are divided by function. See Figure 11-2 for an illustration of the various types of
tools covered.
132
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 
The magic of ABS
In the modern world of cars today, most vehicles are
equipped with an Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS). The
ABS is a four-wheel system that prevents the wheels from
locking up. The system does this by automatically adjust-
ing the brake pressure during an emergency stop. This
enables the driver to maintain steering control and to stop
in the shortest possible distance under most conditions.
The theory behind ABS is simple. A skidding wheel has
less traction than a non-skidding wheel. If your car isn’t
equipped with ABS, and you have to stop quickly, your
wheels may lock up (stop turning), causing you to skid.
As a result, you don’t stop as quickly, and you won’t be
able to steer while your wheels are skidding.

Striking tools
Striking tools apply driving force to an object. (Watch your fingers!) These tools include ham-
mers, sledges, and mallets. Here’s a brief explanation of the three:
 Hammer: Generally made of metal or plastic and consists of a handle, a head, a face
(the part of the hammer that touches the nail or other fastener), a claw (to pull nails),
and a wedge that attaches the head to the handle. The face of a hammer may be made
of steel, brass, or lead.

Chapter 11: Auto & Shop Information

 Mallet: Generally made of metal or plastic but may be made of wood, rubber, or
rawhide. Used to strike another tool or to strike a surface without damaging it. A mallet
doesn’t have a claw like its friend, the hammer.
 Sledge: Generally made of metal; people use it to drive bolts and chisels and to break
rock. A sledge doesn’t have a claw either.
Fastening tools
Fastening tools apply fasteners, such as screws, to objects. (For more info on fasteners,
check out “Sticking Materials Together with Fasteners,” later in this chapter.) Numerous tools
make up the fastening category:
 A stapler is a fastening tool; heavy-duty staplers can staple roofing felt to a roof, for
instance.
 Wrenches turn screws and bolts. The bolt or screw fits between the jaws of the wrench,
and the wrench turns the bolt. Some wrenches have adjustable jaws.
• Open-end wrenches have open jaws.
• Box wrenches are closed. Some wrenches have open-end jaws on one end and a
box wrench on the other.
• Socket wrenches have box-type sockets of varying sizes that can be attached to a
handle, which in turn can be attached to an extension.
Socket, box, and open-ended wrenches come in set, standard sizes — either in
inches or in millimeters. They’re not interchangeable. (Selecting the wrong socket
wrench is how mechanics learn to use cuss words.)
• Torque wrenches apply additional leverage to a fastener.
• Pipe wrenches have serrated jaws and grip round objects.
 A screwdriver, in the shop world, turns screws. (In the civilian world, it’s a yummy
drink!) Some special screwdrivers have different blades to fit different types of special
screws.
• A standard screwdriver has a flat blade at one end of the shank (the other end of
the shank goes into a handle).
• Phillips screwdrivers have a blade that is shaped like a cross; this blade fits into a
cross-shaped Phillips screw.
• An Allen wrench fits hexagonal screw heads. Nobody knows why this tool is called
an Allen wrench, instead of an Allen screwdriver; after all it’s used on hexagonal
screws. That’s just one of the mysteries of the shop-world.
This tool gets its name from the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford,
Connecticut. The Allen wrench was designed in 1943.
• Offset screwdrivers have the shank set at an angle to the blade to allow the tool to
be used in cramped spaces. Offset screwdrivers can have a standard blade,
Phillips blade, or any number of other blades.
 Pliers can be used to fasten and unfasten fasteners, hold objects, and cut material.
When you squeeze the handles, the jaws of the pliers come together.
• Long-nosed pliers, also called needle-nose pliers, have tapered jaws that can hold
small objects or fit into small spaces.
• Curve-nose pliers have curved jaws.
• Slip-joint pliers can be adjusted so the handles lock in a certain position.
134
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

• Wrench pliers or vise-grip pliers have serrated jaws that clamp onto and hold
objects of all shapes.
• Cutting pliers are used to cut wire.
Cutting tools
Cutting tools use sharp blades to cut through metal, wood, or other materials. Cutting tools
have teeth. The number of teeth per inch, called points per inch, gives an indication of the
type of work the saw can do. A saw with fewer teeth is used for rough work, like cutting wood
to size. A saw with more teeth cuts more finely and is used for more delicate work, like
sawing joints and lightweight pieces of wood. Check out Table 11-1 for a breakdown of the
different cutting tools that may be covered on the ASVAB.

of various types
handles close. The blades can be curved or straight. 
Drilling, punching, and gouging tools
No, this section isn’t about hand-to-hand combat training from basic training. Masters in the
art of shop often make holes in the material they’re working with in order to build that per-
fect birdhouse (or whatever else they’re working on). These holes can be done with a variety
of tools, which are covered in the following sections.
Drills and bits
Twist drills use drill bits, which are round pieces of steel shaped in a spiral, to create holes.
Drill bits are attached to a drill (usually a power drill, but sometimes a hand drill operated by
manually turning a crank). The point of the drill bit is sharpened, and the shank is smooth
and fits into the drill.
135
Chapter 11: Auto & Shop Information

A countersink is a drill bit that enlarges the surface of a hole so that a screw head can be
accommodated. A countersink is used to allow the top of the fastener to be set exactly even
with the material to which it’s attached. Without a countersink, the fastener slightly pro-
trudes from the material to which it’s been attached.
Auger bits bore larger holes. They’re shaped differently from drill bits. They’re also much
larger. Auger bits are most commonly used with a brace for drilling holes in wood. Their
length varies from 7 to 10 inches.
Punches
Punches have a sharp end that’s placed against the material to be punctured; the other end is
struck with a hammer. A center punch is used to mark where a drilled hole is to be placed;
this keeps the drill bit in position and prevents the drill from jumping to another part of the
material.
Using a Phillips screwdriver as a punch is bad form in the shop world because hitting the
handle of a screwdriver with a hammer can damage it (and then you’ll get talked about in
serious shop circles).
Chisels
Chisels are used to chip or cut metal or wood. Chisels are made of steel and have a sharp cut-
ting edge. Metal-cutting chisels have different shapes depending on how they’ll be used; cold
chisels are flat; round chisels make circular cuts. Chisels that cut metal are usually struck with
a mallet to make the cut. Some wood chisels, called socket chisels, are also struck with a
mallet. Other wood chisels require only the pressure of your hands.
Wood chisels also come in different shapes, depending on what they’re used for. A butt chisel
has a short blade and is used for in-close work. A mortising chisel has a narrow blade made
for chiseling out the narrow mortises in joints. A framing chisel has a heavy, strong blade
meant for rough work.
Because you use chisels with other tools and the pressure of your hands, there’s a little bit of
a risk involved with this tool. One slip and these instruments can easily cut large chunks out
of your skin, so be careful.
Finishing tools
Filing and finishing shop tools are used to sharpen the blades of other tools and to smooth
the edges of cut metal objects. Files come in a range of fineness, and the blades can be cut in
different patterns. Files also come in different shapes to finish different kinds of objects. Here
are the different kinds of files:
 Single-cut files are used for finishing work and sharpening blades.
 Double-cut files are used for rough work.
 Flat files and half-round files are for general purposes.
 Square and round files fit square and round openings.
Planes are also a type of finishing tool used to prepare wood for final finishing and to fit
doors and trim. Planes consist of a handle to push with, a knob to guide with, a frame, a sole,
and a mouth (where the blade is). Bench planes are used to smooth surfaces. Longer planes
give a more uniform surface.
136
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

Clamping tools
A clamping tool is a device used to hold or fasten objects securely so they won’t move while
you’re working on them. There are several types of clamping tools available for many differ-
ent purposes:
 Pliers (discussed in the “Fastening tools” section earlier in the chapter) can be used to
hold objects while you’re working on them.
 Vises hold material while it’s being sawed, drilled, or glued. There are different types 
of vises:
• A bench vise has large, rough jaws that keep the material from slipping.
• Pipe vises hold round trim or pipes.
• A handscrew vise has two hard, wood jaws connected by two long screws. The
screws are tightened to bring the jaws of the handscrew vise together.
Clamps are used when a vise won’t work. C-clamps consist of a stationary frame and a screw
that moves back and forth to open and shut the clamp.
Measuring tools
As any shop enthusiast will tell you, the golden rule of shop is to “measure twice and cut
once.” It’s frustrating to cut a piece of material only to find it’s just a little bit too short 
to fit in the place you intended. Using measuring tools helps you avoid this embarrassing 
situation.
Tape rules, rigid steel rules, steel (or fiberglass) tape rules, and folding rules are all used to
measure material. Calipers are also used for very exact and small measurements. Calipers
can be used with a rule to measure diameter; the legs of a caliper curve in to measure out-
side curves and curve out to measure inside curves. Slide calipers have the rule built in.
Depth gauges measure the depth of holes. Thickness gauges measure the thickness of small
openings. Thread gauges measure the number of threads per inch in threaded fasteners. 
Wire gauges measure the thickness of wire.
Leveling and squaring tools
A square is used to check the trueness (accuracy) of an angle. Because most squares have
a rule, they can also be used for measuring (see “Measuring tools” earlier in this chapter).
Squares have two arms, called the blade and the tongue, that meet at a right angle. A square
can be set against any angle that is supposed to be a 90-degree angle. If a gap exists between
the square and the material, the material isn’t true — that is, it’s not at the specified angle. A
sliding T-bevel has an adjustable blade so that different angles can be checked.
A plumb bob is a heavy weight that’s suspended from a line. It indicates vertical trueness.
Levels show whether a surface is true. A level has one or more small tubes filled with a liquid
(like alcohol) and an air bubble. If the level is placed on a surface, and the bubble remains
exactly in the center of the tube, the surface is level. (This method can’t be used to see if
your recruiter is on the level. We tried it. Recruiters simply won’t hold still long enough.)

Chapter 11: Auto & Shop Information

Sticking Materials Together with Fasteners
Although wood and metal (and other materials) can be held together with glue, straps, and
other brilliant fastening methods, people usually fasten these types of materials with nails,
screws, bolts, and rivets. These fasteners offer more strength and stability than the white
glue that you used to fasten painted macaroni noodles onto construction paper in the 
first grade.
Nails
Nails are used to hold pieces of wood together. The nail head is flat, and the shank is usually
round. Nail length is designated by the penny system, which is abbreviated with a d. A ten-
penny nail is a 10d nail. Length and thickness generally correspond. Nails that are larger than
20-penny are called spikes and are measured in inches.
Other type of nails include
 Brad and finish nails: They have heads that are made to fit flush with or slightly below
the surface of the wood.
 Common nails: These nails are the most commonly used nails. (How about that for a
truly difficult vocab word?)
 Double-headed nails: These have two heads, one lower than the other. The nail is
driven to the lower head but can be pulled out of the material because of the remaining
higher head. These nails are used for temporary construction that will be taken apart.
Screws and bolts
Unlike nails, you can easily take screws and bolts out of the wood without causing additional
damage to the wood (unless of course the threads are stripped). These fasteners also hold
more tightly than nails. Screws have flat heads, round heads, or oval heads; and in addition
to this classification, they also have standard heads (for slotted screwdrivers) or Phillips
heads. Screw sizes are based on length and the diameter of the unthreaded part of the screw.
Here’s the lowdown on these types of fasteners:
 Wood screws can also be used to fasten wood. (Hmmm, ingenious!)
 Lag screws have square- or hexagon-shaped heads.
 Bolts don’t thread into wood. They have flat ends (as opposed to the pointed ends of
screws). They’re held in place by a nut and washer (check out the following “Nuts and
washers” section). The body of the bolt may have few threads or many.
 Machine screws are used to fasten metal parts. Machine screws are sometimes used
with nuts. They come in various lengths and widths and have a wide variety of heads.
138
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

Nuts and washers
Nuts can be square or hexagonal. Cap nuts are rounded and smooth; stop nuts prevent the
screw or bolt from coming loose. Wing nuts have flanges on each side so they can be tight-
ened by hand.
Washers, on the other hand, prevent damage to the surface of material by preventing the bolt
head from digging into the material. They also help keep the bolt or screw in place. Flat wash-
ers, a simple ring of flat metal, are the most common type of washer. Shakeproof washers
have teeth to prevent them from skipping, while split-lock washers have two ends that dig
into the nut and the material to keep the screw from slipping out.
Rivets
Rivets are commonly used to fasten metal parts together, especially when a weld is insuffi-
cient. Standard rivets are driven using a bucking bar. They come in a wide variety of lengths,
diameters, and head shapes. The rivet material should match the material being fastened.
Pop rivets can be driven when only one side of a join is accessible.
Building a Better Score
If you haven’t picked up auto and shop knowledge by this point in your life and want to do
well on this subtest, one thing you can do is get an automotive manual and take your car
apart (hoping that you can get it back together again). Then get a woodworking book and
build some furniture for your mom. (Even if you mess it up, Mom always likes gifts from the
heart.) Or you can check out your local community college, which may be a more practical
solution. Many community colleges offer basic Auto & Shop classes. You may also want to
take a gander at the following books, all published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.:
 Auto Repair For Dummies by Deanna Sclar
 Woodworking For Dummies by Jeff Strong
 Home Improvement All-in-One For Dummies by Roy Barnhart, James Carey, Morris
Carey, Gene Hamilton, Katie Hamilton, Donald R. Prestly, and Jeff Strong
On this subtest, you usually either know the answer or you say, “Huh?” However, some ques-
tions you run into can be answered by using the common sense approach. For example, say
you run into a question on the ASVAB that reads something like the following:
When attaching two pieces of wood together, the most secure bond would be formed by
using:
(A) wood screws
(B) nails
(C) wood glue
(D) both A and C
If you think about it, screws have threads, which are likely to “grab” wood more securely
than a nail would. Glue would likely strengthen that bond even more. It’s obvious that the
common sense answer would be Choice (D).
139
Chapter 11: Auto & Shop Information

Try a variation of the same question:
The best fastening method to use when attaching pieces of wood together, when time is of
the essence would be:
(A) wood screws
(B) nails
(C) wood glue
(D) both A and C
In this case, the best answer would be Choice (B), as pounding a nail in with a hammer is
generally faster than screwing a screw in with a screwdriver. (Even in these days of electric
screwdrivers).
When all else fails, guessing is okay. If you guess, you have a 25 percent chance of guessing
the right answer. If you leave the answer blank, you have a zero percent chance. If you’re
taking the computerized version of the ASVAB, you don’t have a choice, of course, because
you must provide an answer before you’re presented with the next question.
For help with general guessing hints, check out Chapter 3.

on your aptitude for understanding simple mechanical operations. That’s the purpose of the
Mechanical Comprehension subtest of the ASVAB.
The questions on this subtest measure your understanding of simple machines and mecha-
nisms. Many of the questions on this subtest display a diagram of a simple machine, such as
a series of gears, followed by a question, such as which direction the gears turn or how fast
they revolve. This subtest is almost all about mechanical physics, so you may want to review
some basic physics textbooks from your local library.
Only some military jobs require a good score on this subtest. Turn to the Appendix at the
back of this book for information about the subtest scores you need to qualify for specific
military jobs. If you have no interest in taking apart a fighter aircraft or rebuilding a tank,
you’re better off reviewing for the Word Knowledge or Arithmetic Reasoning subtests, which
make up part of the core exam (the AFQT; see Chapter 1) that you must do well on to even
qualify for enlistment.
To ace this subtest, you also have to bone up on your mathematical skills. The Mechanical
Comprehension subtest often asks you to make calculations based on formulas to explain
mechanical principles. Don’t panic; the formulas are easy to understand, but you do have to
use math to come up with a final answer. See Chapters 7 and 8 for more information on math.
In this chapter, you get the mathematical formulas for commonly asked questions on the
ASVAB, so pay especially close attention to these little beauties. (If the information probably
isn’t on the ASVAB, we don’t burden you with it here.)
This subtest has 25 questions. You have 19 minutes to answer the questions, which is
enough time for a mechanically oriented individual to tackle this subtest and put a broken
clock back together. Well, maybe not the whole clock.

Understanding Machines and Mechanisms
Ever since the invention of the wheel, humans have used machines to help do work more effi-
ciently. Machines are also used to help with work that couldn’t be done otherwise. Think of
the mechanisms and machines you use everyday — from the simple (like the hinge that
allows a door to move easily when you push it open) to the more complex (like the hydraulic
lift that allows you to lift a car up to check its underside). You could move most doors out of
the way without hinges, but you couldn’t lift a car over your head without some help.
Machines help apply and use force more effectively. In physics, force (power or strength)
allows change to the velocity (speed) of an object. By applying force, you can open the door
or close it; speed it up (slam it), or slow it down (catch it before it slams); or make it change
direction (push it shut when the wind blows it open).
Here are some of the forces that act on objects:
 Friction: Resistance to the motion of two objects or surfaces that touch
 Gravity: The physical property that draws objects toward the center of the earth
 Magnetism: The property of attracting iron or steel
 Recoil: The property of kicking back when released
 Static electricity: The production of stationary electrical charges, often the result of
friction
In order to perform work, sometimes you have to overcome these forces by applying more
force. For example, when you’re moving a piano across a smooth, vinyl floor, little friction is
produced so the amount of force required to push the piano is equal only to the piano’s
weight. But when you’re moving a piano across a carpeted floor, more friction is produced,
so you have to push harder to move the same piano the same distance.
You can use a mathematical formula to determine force:
Force = Mass × Acceleration
Martial artists use this concept all the time. Although a larger fighter may have more size
(mass), a smaller fighter usually has more speed (acceleration), possibly resulting in both
fighters applying the same amount of force. This concept is why 110-pound martial artists
can break boards and bricks just as well as 200-pound martial artists.
All Work and No Play: Measuring Work
When a machine multiplies the force you use, it gives you a mechanical advantage. This con-
cept can be stated as
Some simple machines may give you a mechanical advantage of only one or two. (This
means that they enable you to do one or two times the amount of work by expending the
same effort.) But those simple machines are still worth using! Often, even if a machine 
doesn’t multiply your effort (or doesn’t multiply your effort by much), it can at least spread
your effort out and make it more effective.
Mechanical Advantage= Resistance
Effort
142
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

The inclined plane and simple pulley work as simple machines (check out the “Ramping up
the inclined plane” and the “Easing your effort: Pulleys and gears” sections later in this chap-
ter for more info).
What is work?
Mechanically speaking, work happens when a force (usually measured in pounds), moving
over a measurable distance (usually measured in feet), overcomes a resistance. So the unit of
measure for work is often called a foot-pound.
Work is different from effort — work is the result of effort. You can think of effort as being
force and work being what you produce with that force.
One foot-pound of work occurs when a one-pound weight is lifted to a height of one foot. Or
you can represent this concept in equation form:
Work = Force × Distance
The resistance that the work overcomes isn’t the same thing as the weight of the object that
the work moves. (If you’ve ever tried to put your freaked-out cat in a cat carrier to go to the
vet, you know what we mean.)
In other words, if you try to move a 1,200-pound piano, you’ll probably notice a measurable
difference between the amount of work it takes to shove it along the floor and the amount of
work it takes to carry it up the stairs. But don’t take our word for it — you can demonstrate
this concept at home. First, find a 1,200-pound piano and push it across the floor. Next, put it
on your back and carry it up the stairs. See the difference? (Really, don’t put the piano on
your back. We’re just trying to make a point here.)
When you move the piano across the floor, you’re really working (pushing) against the fric-
tional resistance (the force that’s produced when two surfaces rub together) of the piano
rather than its full weight. Under these circumstances, the frictional resistance of the piano
offers less resistance than its full weight. There are also times when an object’s full weight is
less than its frictional resistance. Consider trying to push a textbook across a deep-pile
carpet. Picking the book up and carrying it is easier. (For more about friction, see the section,
“Friction: Resisting the urge to work.”)
So why do you get tired from holding all those textbooks when you have to stand around and
wait to talk to your teacher? You’re not doing anything with the books, right? Well, actually,
you are. You’re resisting the pull of gravity, which is a force. Next time, set the books down
on the floor (but don’t shove them across a deep-pile carpet).
Friction: Resisting the urge to work
When one surface (a floor) resists the movement of another surface (the bottom of a piano),
the result is frictional resistance. This friction isn’t like resisting to cut the grass. That type of
resistance may cause friction between you and your dad, but we’re talking about a different
kind of resistance here.
Rolling friction (like the friction that occurs when you roll a wheel along the pavement) is
always less than sliding friction (which occurs when you shove a piano along the floor). If
you put wheels on a piano, it’s much easier to push!
143
Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

You can decrease friction by using a lubricant. Oil, grease, and similar materials reduce fric-
tion between two surfaces. So, theoretically, if you oil the bottom of a piano, it’s easier to
move! Note: Oiling the bottom of your piano isn’t recommended (for reasons involving the
appearance of your floor and piano).
Gaining power by working quicker
Power is the rate of work. If Mary Lou is able to lift more 50-pound sacks of potatoes onto the
truck bed in ten minutes than Joe is, Mary Lou is more powerful than Joe. Mathematically
speaking:
In this formula, work is measured in foot-pounds, time is measured in minutes, and power is
measured in foot-pounds per minute. However, the unit of measure for power is commonly
put in terms of horsepower (hp).
Horsepower is derived from the fact that an average horse can do 33,000 foot-pounds of work
in one minute. Therefore, 1 horsepower = 33,000 foot-pounds per minute. One horsepower is
also the same as 550 foot-pounds per second.
Working well under pressure
Pressure is a measurement of force. Pressure is usually measured in pounds per square inch
(psi). The formula for deriving pressure is
If 50 pounds of force are exerted on 10 square inches of surface, the amount of pressure is
5 pounds per square inch (5 = 50 ÷ 10).
Consider this: If you’re sleeping in bed, the amount of pressure being exerted per square inch
is much less than when you’re standing on your feet. The surface area of the bottoms of your
feet (supporting all that weight) is much less than the surface area of all your body parts that
touch the mattress.
Ever wonder how a person can lie on a bed of nails? The answer involves elementary physics.
His or her body rests evenly on hundreds of nails; therefore, no individual nail exerts a great
amount of pressure against the skin. Have you ever seen someone stand on a bed of nails? It’s
unlikely because more pressure is on the foot, and the nails would puncture the feet.
A barometer is a gauge that measures atmospheric pressure. Normally atmospheric pressure
is 14.7 psi. A change in air pressure means the weather is about to change. For more informa-
tion on science and barometric pressure, see Chapter 10.
The Force of Attraction: Gravity
Gravity is a force of nature that you experience every day. It’s produced by all matter in the
universe and attracts all pieces of matter, regardless of type. The Earth produces gravity and
so do the sun, other planets, your car, your house, and your body. Even this book you’re
reading produces gravity. Check out the next couple of sections for a detailed discussion of
gravity and how it works.

What goes up must come down
Sir Isaac Newton invented gravity in 1687 when he failed to pay attention while sitting under
a tree and got bonked on the noggin by an apple. Before that, gravity didn’t exist, and every-
one just floated around. Okay, we’re kidding. Isaac Newton didn’t invent gravity. But the
famous mathematician was the first to study gravity seriously, and he came up with the
theory (now a scientific law) of how gravity works.
Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every
other object in the universe. The amount (force) of the attraction depends on the mass of the
object. If you’re sitting in front of your television, you may be surprised to know that the tele-
vision set is attracting you. However, because the mass of the TV is so small compared to the
mass of the Earth, you don’t notice the physical “pull” toward the television set.
The old saying, “What goes up must come down,” is appropriate when discussing gravity. If
you fire a bullet straight up into the air, it will travel (overcoming the force of gravity) until it
reaches its furthest or highest point, and then it will fall. So, what causes it to fall?
On Earth, gravity pulls objects downward toward the center of the Earth. The force of gravity
acting on an object is equal to the weight of the object. Of course, this fact is only true on
Earth. Other planets have lesser or greater masses than the Earth, so the weight of objects
on those planets will be different.
Newton’s law also says that the greater the distance is between two objects, the less the
objects will attract each other. In other words, the farther away an object is from the Earth
(or any large body), the less it will weigh. If you stand at the top of a high mountain, you will
weigh less than you will at sea level. Don’t get too excited about this weight-loss technique.
Gravitational pull isn’t the next big diet craze. The difference is incredibly small. Sorry!
For an object to really lose weight, it must be far away from the Earth (or any other large
body). When an object is far enough away from these bodies that it experiences practically
no gravitational pull from them, it is said to experience weightlessness — just like the astro-
nauts you see on TV.
False gravity of a spinning 
object: Centrifugal force
An object traveling in a circle appears to experience a gravitational force. This isn’t really
gravity, but instead it’s a concept known as centrifugal force. The amount of force depends on
the mass of the object, the speed of rotation, and the distance from the center:
 The more massive the object, the greater the force.
 The greater the speed of the object, the greater the force.
 The greater the distance from the center, the greater the force.
Centrifugal Force doesn’t really exist, so many scientists refer to it as a false force. It’s not a
force at all, but rather a product of Newton’s (remember him?) laws of motion (see the previ-
ous section, “What goes up must come down”). This characterization seems wrong because
when your car goes off the road and crashes or when your bicycle skids out from under you
when cornering a slippery curve, you feel like this force had something to do with it. Because
it feels real, it’s often useful to treat it as if it’s a real force.
If you’re riding on a merry-go-round on the playground (wee!), you have to exert a constant
force to keep from flying off. This force isn’t due to something actually pushing you in that
direction, but by your body’s inertia trying to keep you moving in a straight line. Because
145
Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

one of Newton’s laws states that accelerating objects tend to want to travel in one direction,
as the merry-go-round turns, your accelerating body wants to keep traveling in one direction,
so you feel you’re being “pushed” outward.
Giving Force a Direction
Forces are vector quantities. That means that they have both a magnitude and a direction
associated with them. Forces applied in the same direction as other forces magnify the total
force, while forces that move in opposite directions reduce the total force. In general, an
object can be acted on by several different forces at any one time. This section gives you the
basics of force that you need to know for the ASVAB.
The basics of action and reaction
Sir Isaac Newton sure was one of the sharpest crayons in the box. His third law of motion
states that for every action (force) in nature there’s an equal and opposite reaction. In other
words, if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B also exerts an equal and opposite
force on object A. Notice that the forces are exerted on different objects.
Take a look at Figure 12-1. As you sit in your chair reading this book, your body exerts a
downward force on the chair and the chair exerts an upward force on your body. There are
two forces resulting from this interaction: a force on the chair and a force on your body.
These two forces are called action and reaction forces.
This force can also be used to describe how a motorboat moves through the water. As the
propellers turn, they push (accelerate) the water behind the boat (action). The water reacts
by pushing the boat forward (reaction).
Applying force to two ends: Tension
Tension force is the force transmitted through a rope, string, or wire when force is applied to
both ends. The force is the amount of tension directed along the rope, string, or wire and
pulls equally on the objects at both ends. Tension force is usually measured in either force-
pounds or newtons (N). 4.45 newtons equal 1 force-pound. See Figure 12-2.

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

Balancing forces
A very basic concept when dealing with forces is the idea of equilibrium or balance. When
two or more forces interact so that their combination cancels the other(s) out, a state of
equilibrium occurs. In this state, the velocity of an object doesn’t change. The forces are con-
sidered to be balanced if the rightward forces are balanced by the leftward forces and the
upward forces are balanced by the downward forces.
If an object is at rest and is in a state of equilibrium, then it’s at static equilibrium. Static
means being stationary or at rest. For example, a glass of water sitting on a table is at static
equilibrium. The table exerts an upward force on the glass to counteract the force of gravity.
Elastic recoil: The trampoline of physics
Liquids and gasses don’t have a specific shape, but solid matter does. Solids are perfectly
happy with the way they look and resist changes in shape. If you exert a force on a solid
shape, it responds by exerting a force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic
recoil.
Take a look at Figure 12-3. The cat is standing on a board suspended on two blocks. While the
board bends, the cat can feel the force of the board trying to regain its original shape. If the
cat steps off the board, the board will spring back to its normal state.

Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

Relying on Machines to Help You Work
Ever since Zog crawled out of his cave and invented the wheel to help him carry fur coats to
his girlfriend, mankind has made use of machines that help him to make work easier.
Machines give you the ability to magnify and change the direction of forces. Machines make
work easier by providing some trade-off between the force applied and the distance over
which it’s applied. Keep reading to find out more!
Using leverage to your advantage
You may not think of the seesaw at the neighborhood park as a machine, but it is. It’s a lever.
Levers are among the simplest machines used to help increase force.
All levers work by using a fulcrum (point of support) to reduce resistance and multiply the
effect of effort. Resistance is exerted at one end of the lever (the resistance arm) and effort is
exerted at the other (the effort arm). The effort arm moves the resistance arm. See Figure 12-4.
To determine how much a lever reduces the amount of effort needed to do work, use the fol-
lowing formula:
As you can see, the amount of effort needed to move the lever varies depending on how long
the effort arm is and how long the resistance arm is. Keep in mind that a short resistance
arm, while easier to move, can’t move an object as far through space as a longer resistance
arm can.
The mechanical advantage of using a lever can be stated as
If the effort arm is six inches and the resistance arm is three inches, the mechanical advan-
tage is two. If the effort arm is six feet and the resistance arm is three feet, the mechanical
advantage is still two.
Ramping up the inclined plane
The inclined plane, also called a ramp, is another very simple machine that makes moving an
object from one point to another easier. The ramp spreads your work out over a longer dis-
tance, so less force is needed to do the work.

For instance, suppose you have to lift a 50-pound barrel to a truck bed that’s 3 feet off the
ground. You would have to use 50 pounds of force for 3 feet to move the barrel. But if you put
a 6-foot ramp in place and rolled the barrel up the ramp, you would only use half as much
force to get the barrel in the truck because the mechanical advantage of such a ramp is 2.
The advantage of using a ramp can be expressed as
Wedges are a form of inclined plane and can multiply your effort in much the same way as a
ramp can. Screws are also inclined planes, only in spiral form. Screw jacks, which you can
use to lift your house up to build a new foundation, are a combination of a lever and an
inclined plane.
Easing your effort: Pulleys and gears
Pulleys and gears are simple machines that can be used to change the magnitude and direc-
tion of force. When you ride in an elevator, step onto an escalator, drive your car, or wind up
your watch, you’re using pulleys and gears.
Block and tackle systems
When used in a block and tackle arrangement, pulleys make lifting heavy objects easier. In
block and tackle systems, pulleys can also be used to change the direction of your pull. If you
tie a 200-pound crate to one end of a rope, run the rope through a pulley, and grab the other
end of the rope, you can pull down on the rope to lift the crate up. Without a pulley, you
could pull down on the crate all day, and it wouldn’t go up (see Figure 12-5). In this case,
using a simple pulley, the force of your pull must equal the weight of the object being lifted.
The regular pulley doesn’t multiply your force, but it makes the process of lifting easier.
Using a block and tackle allows you to distribute your force more effectively. Instead of hoist-
ing that entire 200-pound crate in one try, you can pull on a rope to lift it a few inches, pull 
on the rope some more to lift it a few more inches, and so on. This makes the work easier to
perform.

Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

A block and tackle system can also be used to reduce effort by magnifying force. To help
understand how this works, look at Figure 12-6:
 Example 1 shows a 100-pound box secured to the ceiling by a single line. The weight
supported by the line is equal to the weight of the box.
 In Example 2, the box is secured to the ceiling by using two lines. Each line is support-
ing one-half the weight of the box.
 In Example 3, a single line is threaded through a pulley. While the line (as a whole) is
supporting the entire weight of the box, each section of the line is only supporting one-
half of the box’s weight, just as in Example 2.
 In Example 4, a man is using this principle to lift the 100-pound box by applying only 50
pounds of force. In short, this block and tackle system provides the man with a
mechanical advantage of 2. In receiving a mechanical advantage of force, the man must
pull the rope farther than if he weren’t using a pulley. In this example, the man would
have to pull two feet of rope to raise the box one foot.
Additional pulleys can be added to a block and tackle arrangement to further increase the
mechanical advantage. Figure 12-7 shows a couple of examples:
 In the first example, three sections of rope equal a mechanical advantage of three.
Lifting a weight with this pulley arrangement requires only 1⁄3 of the effort required to
lift the weight directly. However, in order to lift the crate one foot, you have to pull
three feet of rope.
 Example 2 illustrates a block and tackle system with six sections of rope. Using this
arrangement provides you with a mechanical advantage of six, but you have to pull the
rope six feet for every foot you wished to raise the box.
Understanding how gears work
Machines often use gears to transmit motion from one place to another. An additional advan-
tage of using gears is that they can be used to change direction, increase or decrease speed,
or increase or decrease force.
Gears arranged in a series turn in the opposite direction of each other. If you have an even
number of gears connected in a series, the first and last gear turn in opposite directions. If
you have an odd number of gears aligned in a series, the first and last gear spin in the same
direction. Look at Figure 12-8. Gear 1 is rotating counterclockwise, which causes Gear 2 to
turn clockwise, resulting in Gear 3 spinning counterclockwise, with Gear 4 turning clockwise.

The speed at which a gear rotates (in relation to the driving gear connected to it) is depend-
ent on the number of teeth. In Figure 12-9, Gear 1 has six teeth while Gear 2 interacts with
eight teeth. This relation of teeth can be expressed as a ratio of 6:8, which can be further
reduced to 3:4. That means that Gear 1 has to rotate four times in order for Gear 2 to make
three revolutions. Or, expressed another way, for each rotation made by Gear 1, Gear 2 will
make 3⁄4 of a revolution.
When gear shafts aren’t parallel to one another, special gears called bevel gears can be used
to connect gears that have shafts at different angles. This concept can be easily confused.
The principles of gear rotation remain the same. Figure 12-10 shows an example of a bevel
gear designed to connect shafts having a 90-degree angle to the other.

Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

Pulley and belt arrangements
Pulleys have another use, in addition to magnifying force as part of a block and tackle
system. When arranged with a system of belts, pulleys can drive other pulleys. Like gears,
pulleys are used to transmit motion from one location to another. However, the physical
properties of pulleys are different than those of gears. For example, unless the driving belt is
reversed (twisted), pulleys connected in series rotate in the same direction. Figure 12-11
illustrates this concept by two sets of pulleys: In the first set of pulleys, all the pulleys turn in
the same direction (counterclockwise) as the driving pulley. Note, however, the second set of
pulleys. The driving pulley and the lower pulley are rotating counterclockwise, but the right-
hand pulley is rotating in a clockwise direction.
While the speed of gear rotation is determined by the number of teeth, how fast a pulley
rotates depends on the diameter of the pulley in relation to the diameter of the pulley which
is driving it. Have a look at Figure 12-12.
Pulley A has a diameter of 1 inch, Pulley B has a diameter of 2 inches, and Pulley C measures
3 inches in diameter. The ratio between the three pulleys is 1:2:4. For every complete revolu-
tion made by Pulley A, Pulley B makes 1⁄2 of a revolution. Each time Pulley B makes a full revo-
lution, Pulley C makes 1⁄2 of a revolution. Thus, for every full revolution of Pulley A, Pulley C
makes 1⁄4 of a revolution.
Multiplying your effort: Wheels and axles
The wheel-and-axle machine multiplies the effort you use. When you steer a car by using a
steering wheel (which is a wheel-and-axle device), a little effort exerted on the steering wheel
turns the wheels of the car in the direction you desire. Turning your car wheels would be a
lot more complicated if you didn’t have the steering wheel.

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

In true wheel-and-axle machines, the wheel and the axle are fixed together and turn at the
same time. This arrangement multiplies the amount of force you can exert by a considerable
amount. The relationship between the radius of the wheel and the radius of the area to which
force is being applied determines the mechanical advantage you receive by using this piece
of equipment. (Remember, the radius of a circle equals half the diameter; a straight line
extending from the center of the circle to the edge is the radius of a circle.) A hand drill may
apply 200 pounds of force for your 10 pounds of effort. (A hand drill uses a gear to convert
the direction of the force.) See Figure 12-13.
Getting a grip on things with vices
While many mechanisms are designed to transmit motion, some machines have the purpose
of keeping things motionless. Vices are very useful because they can close around items and
hold them with great force (much greater force than you could do by holding the item in
your hands). Figure 12-14 shows an illustration of a standard shop vice.

Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

Rotating the handle on the vice causes a screw to turn, which either tightens or loosens the
vice. A screw is a cylinder wrapped in a continuous spiral. The distance between the ridges of
the spiral are called the pitch of the thread. The greater the pitch of the thread, the farther
the jaws of the vice move for each revolution of the handle. However, there’s a trade-off.
Larger pitches require more force to rotate the handle than screws with smaller pitches.
Magnifying your force with liquid: Hydraulic jacks
Hydraulic jacks use liquid to magnify force. Usually some type of oil is used, because oil is
nearly incompressible, meaning that it transmits whatever force is applied to it with no (or
little) loss in efficiency. The mechanical advantage is the ratio between the diameters of the
two cylinders.
In Figure 12-15, the small cylinder has a diameter of 1 inch and the large cylinder has a diame-
ter of 4 inches. This difference in diameter results in a mechanical advantage of 4. If the rocks
weigh a total of 100 pounds, only 25 pounds of force has to be applied to the piston in the
small cylinder in order to lift the load. However, while force required is reduced by a factor 
of 4, the smaller piston has to move four feet for every foot the piston in the larger cylinder
moves.

Working Your Way to a Better Test Score
When you take the Mechanical Comprehension subtest, you may not know the correct
answer to a question, or you may not know the mechanical principle involved. You may know
the mechanical principle but not remember the formula you need to come up with the right
answer. Never fear, you can still stumble through this test without totally flaming out.
Questions on this subtest often include illustrations. The ASVAB test makers expect you to
look at the illustrated device and guess how it operates. When you run across these types of
questions, make sure that you understand the illustration. Often, parts of the device are
labeled. Make certain you read and understand these labels before you try to answer a ques-
tion about the illustration. Then try to use a common-sense approach. You may see the fol-
lowing question:
Which of the following controls an automatic sump pump?
(A) mechanical switch
(B) manual switch
(C) pneumatic valve
(D) float
You may not know the answer to this question, but you can rule out one answer, manual
switch (Choice B), because the question asks you about an automatic sump pump, and any-
thing manual isn’t automatic. Eliminating one choice narrows your chances from one in four
to one in three. Not a bad start, huh?
A sump pump is used to drain water from an area, and if you knew that, you have an even
better shot at getting this question right. Think about what type of device detects the pres-
ence of water, and you may guess correctly that Choice (D), float, is the right answer.
You can answer a lot of the questions correctly if you just think about what you’ve observed
in the world around you. Remember, the Mechanical Comprehension subtest also tests your
knowledge of physical principles of the world around you — questions you may expect to
find on the General Science subtest. For example, a question may ask something like this:
If all the following objects are the same temperature, which one will feel coldest?
(A) a wooden spoon
(B) a plastic spoon
(C) a metal spoon
(D) a fiberglass spoon
You don’t need to know mechanical or scientific principles to know that a metal spoon will
feel colder than the other spoons. So it makes sense to select Choice (C) as your answer,
even if you can’t explain the science behind this correct answer.
The nerve endings in your skin detect the difference between your inside body temperature
and your outside skin temperature. Metal is an excellent conductor of heat, so heat flows
from your hand into the metal. The heat is then conducted rapidly away into the bulk of the
metal, leaving your skin surface relatively cool. That’s why metal feels cooler than other, less
efficient conductors of heat, such as wood, plastic, or fiberglass.

Chapter 12: Mechanical Comprehension

Mechanical comprehension is mostly elementary physics. Improving your knowledge of
basic mechanical physics principles improves your chances for a better score on this sub-
test. Physics For Dummies by Steve Holzner, Ph.D., (Wiley) is an excellent place to start if you
decide you need extra study in this area.
The mathematics of mechanics
Mechanical principles are based on mathematical principles. Therefore, a screw making a
complete revolution turns 360 degrees because math states that a complete revolution
always equals 360 degrees. If you have to know the surface area of a floor in order to deter-
mine the pounds per square inch a ton of tile would put on the floor, that’s a mathematical
principle too (area = length × width).
Suppose you run across this question:
A 3-inch-diameter flanged pipe with six holes is being fitted to a base with six holes. What’s
the maximum number of degrees the pipe must be rotated in order to line up the holes?
(A) 120 degrees
(B) 180 degrees
(C) 60 degrees
(D) 360 degrees
This isn’t really a Mechanical Comprehension question at all — it’s a math question. The only
part that requires mechanical knowledge is knowing that the holes are spaced equidistant
from one another on a flanged pipe. The answer is 360 degrees ÷ 6 = 60 degrees (Choice C).
Guessing with a mechanical mind
Like most of the other subtests on the ASVAB, you can and should guess on the Mechanical
Comprehension subtest when you don’t know the answer. You have at least some small
chance of guessing the correct answer when you take a stab at it. If you don’t guess at all,
then you have no chance of getting the correct answer.
Check out these tips to help you narrow the field:
 The amount of force needed to move an object (not including friction resistance) is
never greater than the weight of the object. Any answer that includes a force that’s
greater than the weight of the object being moved is probably wrong.
 The correct answer is a mechanical answer. For example, if the question asks, “What’s
the purpose of lubricating oil in an engine?” the correct answer won’t be, “To make the
parts look shiny.” The answer would be “to reduce friction between moving parts.”
 Any change in a mechanical operation almost always has pluses and minuses associ-
ated with it. So, when a question proposes a change, the correct answer is probably
the one that specifies the good, the bad, and the ugly. For instance, suppose the ques-
tion is, “Enlarging the wheel on a hand drill will . . . ?” The correct answer is the one
that says something like, “Increase the amount of mechanical advantage but also
increase the amount of effort needed to operate the drill.”

Not every military career requires a good score on this subtest. (Turn to the Appendix to
find out what military jobs require a score on this — and other — subtests.) If the military
feels that the Electronics Information subtest is important to your desired career, study
intensively for this test. You can even take a course or two at the local community college if
you don’t have a strong enough background in this area. If, however, you don’t intend to
pursue a career that requires a score on this subtest, spend your time studying for other
areas of the ASVAB.
You have 9 minutes to answer 20 questions on this subtest. Although 9 minutes is sufficient
time to answer the questions, it doesn’t provide much time for anything else — if you don’t
know an answer, guess and go.
Uncovering the Secrets of Electricity
One day in 1752, Benjamin Franklin was minding his own business, flying a kite in a storm.
A key was tied to the kite string and when lightning struck the metal key, Ben was struck by
the notion that lightning must be electrified air. Although electricity was just a hobby for
Ben Franklin, he made many important contributions. As a result of his famous kite flight he
created many of the terms used today when folks talk about electricity: battery, conductor,
condenser, charge, discharge, uncharged, negative, minus, plus, electric shock, and electrician.

Electricity is a general term for the variety of phenomena resulting from the presence and
flow of electric charge. You can’t see electricity running through a wire (but you can certainly
feel it). You only know electricity is there when you flip on the light switch and the light turns
on. Even though electricity appears to be pretty mysterious at first glance, scientists under-
stand a great deal about its properties and how it works.
Electricity is like water — it flows. Electricity is subject to pressure, which causes the electri-
cal current to flow; it’s also subject to resistance, which interferes with the electrical flow.
Electricity is also measured in three different ways:
 Volts: The amount of work done when electrons move between two points
 Amperes (amps): The number of electrons that move past a specific point in
one second
 Ohm: Measures resistance, including anything that could limit the flow of electrons
Electricity comes with some other terms that are important for you to know for the ASVAB:
 Electric current occurs when electrons move from one place to another.
 The use of conductors, such as copper and water, allow the electrons to move freely.
 Insulators, such as rubber and wood, discourage the electric current.
 A watt measures the amount of electricity consumed.
 A watt-hour is an amount of energy used in a length of time.
 Most electricity is measured in kilowatt-hours, which is the amount of energy used in
one hour by one kilowatt of electricity.
See “Measuring power” later in this chapter for the complete scoop on watts.
Examining the current of the electrical river
Electrical current is the flow — or, more precisely, the rate of flow — of electrical force in a
conductor. Current is measured in coulombs. A coulomb is the amount of electricity provided
by a current of one ampere flowing for one second. It’s called a coulomb because a guy
named Charles de Coulomb discovered this little bugger in the late nineteenth century, and
the rules say that if you discover something, someone will stick your name on it for life (not
sure who made up those rules, though). Calling a coulomb a coulomb is easier than calling a
coulomb by its other name — a meter-kilogram-second unit of electricity.
If one coulomb flows past a specified point in one second, that’s one ampere (amp). For the
sake of convenience, measured electrical currents are often taken in amps. Some really tiny
currents are measured in milliamperes; one milliampere is one-thousandth of an ampere.
(An ampere represents the strength of a current.)
Current meters, called ammeters, measure the flow of current through a circuit. A circuit
(you knew this was coming) is just the path of a current. See “Floating along the circular
river: Circuits,” later in this chapter.
Withstanding the pressure
Electrical pressure affects the number of amperes moseying along a wire (or whatever you’re
using to conduct the electricity from one place to another). More pressure means that more
158
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

amperes flow along a wire (or conductor). The unit of measure for this pressure is called a
volt. The voltage between two points in a circuit is sometimes called the drop.
If you have a small wire and you want to run electrical current through it, you have to use
more pressure — that is, a higher voltage — than if you have a large wire that you want to
run current through. Think of the water pipes in your house. The narrower the pipe, the
more pressure required for the water to flow through it. The wider the pipe, the less pressure
required. Just take a look at your bathroom: The water in your toilet is under less pressure
than the water in your shower.
A cell (a storage compartment for electricity) has a voltage of about 1.5 volts. Therefore, you
can figure out the number of cells a battery has by dividing the voltage by 1.5. Pretty handy
stuff, huh? You can also measure the amount of voltage being applied to a current in a circuit
with a voltmeter.
Regulating the electrical river
Current doesn’t just flow from one end of a wire (or whatever conductor you’re using) to the
other. Impediments pop up along the way. The amount of resistance that interferes with the
flow is measured in ohms (pronounced just like those yoga chants). If the flow of electricity
needs to be regulated, resistance is deliberately set up in a circuit. (If the flow of electricity
wasn’t regulated, the engines powering can openers and microwave ovens would quickly
overheat and melt.) In a sense, sending electric current down a narrow wire (which exerts
more resistance than a wider wire) is a way to deliberately implement resistance.
The symbol for ohm looks like an upside-down horseshoe: Ω.
Resistance can be measured by dividing the voltmeter reading by the ammeter reading or by
using an ohmmeter.
If you have a current flowing through a wire, three influences are present:
 The pressure of the current (voltage)
 The resistance to the current (ohms)
 The strength of the current (amperes)
These three influences are always present in direct relationship to each other. If you know
the value of any two of the influences, you can find the value of the third. (Yes, this requires
more math. Sorry.)
Ohm’s law, which was first stated by Simon Ohm, reads, “The current in a circuit is directly
proportional to the applied voltage and inversely proportional to the circuit resistance,” but
it’s easier to understand in mathematical terms:
 Current (amperes) = Voltage (volts)/Resistance (ohms)
 Voltage = Current × Resistance
 Resistance = Current ÷ Voltage
When stating the relationship mathematically, abbreviations are used: I (current) = 
E (voltage) × R (resistance).

Chapter 13: Electronics Information

Measuring power
Power is measured in watts. One watt is a very small amount of power. It would require nearly
750 watts to equal one horsepower. A kilowatt represents 1,000 watts. A kilowatt-hour (kWh) —
the amount of electricity a power plant generates or a customer uses over a period of time —
is equal to the energy of 1,000 watts working for one hour. Kilowatt-hours are determined by
multiplying the number of kWhs required by the number of hours of use. For example, if you
use a 40-watt light bulb 5 hours a day, you have used 200 watts of power, or 0.2 kilowatt-hours
of electrical energy.
The term watt was named to honor James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine.
Floating along the circular river: Circuits
Although this section suggests that electricity flows like water, it actually flows more like
NASCAR. Electricity must be sent along the path of a closed circle (a circuit), just like all
those NASCAR speedsters roaring around the track. They never actually get anywhere; they
just keep driving in circles. Electricity is a lot like that.
However, electricity does flow like a river in one respect. In general, electricity, follows the
path of least resistance. The conventional way in thinking about the electrical flow of current
is to imagine electrical particles moving from the positive (+) terminal of a battery to the neg-
ative (–) terminal. In fact, this concept is called conventional current.
To prevent confusion you should always use conventional current when trying to understand
how circuits work. Imagine positively charged particles flowing from + to – (even though this
is technically wrong — see the nearby sidebar, “Electricity in the early days”). One terminal
(also called a pole; in other words, one end) in a circuit is always the negative (–) terminal
and one is always the positive (+) terminal (see Figure 13-1).
If any of the wires leading from one terminal to the other is broken, the circuit is shot — no
more electricity. Here’s another circuit problem that may come up: A short circuit occurs
when any wire accidentally crosses over another wire, causing the electricity to bypass the
rest of the circuit and not follow the intended path.
Obeying the electrical traffic rules
To control the current needed for different electrical applications, more or less resistance is
applied to a circuit. Sometimes the circuit must be opened in order to add or remove resist-
ance. In other words, the flow of the electricity must be interrupted in order to physically
change the resistance. (A circuit breaker, which is a device that automatically interrupts the
electrical current, is an example of opening a circuit to control the current. But when the circuit
breaker “trips,” the electrical device can no longer operate.) Some devices use a rheostat, which
can vary the resistance without opening the circuit — the device can continue to work even as
the resistance is altered. If an application doesn’t use all the electricity, the rheostat absorbs it.

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

A dimmer switch on a light is an example of a rheostat. You increase the amount of resist-
ance to dim the light and decrease the resistance to brighten the light.
Keep in mind, though, that a current doesn’t always flow in one direction. A direct current
(DC) does — it only and always flows in one direction. An alternating current (AC), however,
constantly changes direction (in a regular pattern). The number of times a current changes
direction per second is known as its frequency. The hertz (Hz) is the unit of measurement for
frequency.
The AC (alternating current, not the air conditioner) in your house probably completes 60
alternating cycles per second. One hertz equals one complete cycle per second. In other
words, the current makes two complete alternations of direction. Therefore, the AC in your
house has a frequency of 60 Hz. (Another way to say frequency or hertz is cycles per second.)
High voltage is easier to obtain with alternating current. And sending high voltage down a
power line is cheaper than sending low voltage, so most electricity comes in the form of AC.
Electronic devices operate at high frequencies. Because electronic devices operate at very
high frequencies, kilohertz (kHz) — one thousand hertz — are often used to measure their
frequencies. A megahertz (MHz) is one million hertz.
AM radio stations often broadcast in the 500- to 1,600-kHz range. Television stations may
broadcast at 50 MHz. Radar operates at frequencies as high as 100,000 MHz.
Producing electrical cause and effect
Electric currents can produce different effects. These effects are packaged and sold commer-
cially. The following is a description of effects produced by current and some of their com-
mercial applications:
 Chemical effect: Current produces this effect when it passes through a chemical
compound and breaks that compound up. Also called electrolytic decomposition,
this phenomenon is used in electroplating (a process used to cover objects with a
very thin coating of metal).
 Heat effect: Conducting electricity causes wires to become heated. Heat develops
because the current must overcome the resistance of the wire. This heat energy can be
quite obvious or hardly noticeable to touch depending on the size of the wire and the
amount of current.
161
Chapter 13: Electronics Information
Electricity in the early days
In the early days, when scientists were just beginning to
experiment with electricity, they attempted to discover the
direction of electrical flow. They knew there were two
kinds of electrical charge, positive (+) and negative (–).
However, with the equipment they had at the time, they
found it impossible to determine which way current moves
through a circuit. Finally they just threw up their hands and
made a guess! Everything known at the time could be
explained by imagining positive electrical charges flowing
through the circuit toward the negative terminal.
Turns out they were wrong. When the electron was dis-
covered in 1897, it was found to have a negative charge.
Electricity in a circuit is actually the travel of electrons
(negative) toward the positive terminal. However, by the
time the electron was discovered the idea of electricity
flowing from + to – (conventional current) was firmly
established. Luckily it’s not a problem to think of elec-
tricity in this way because positive charge flowing for-
ward is equivalent to negative charge flowing backward.

 Magnetic effect: Magnetic force is produced when two simple magnets are brought
together. Each magnet has two poles: a north pole and a south pole. When two like poles
touch, the magnets repel each other. When two unlike poles touch, the magnets attract
and stick together. A magnetic field surrounds magnets when magnetic force is working,
which means that magnetic force extends beyond the magnets. When a wire is intro-
duced into the magnetic field, the wire becomes a conductor for the magnetic current.
Electricity flowing through a wire will repel a magnet. If the wire is wrapped around an
iron core and a current is sent through the wire, the iron becomes magnetized. This
effect is used to create energy through electromagnetic induction, the basic principle
behind the electric generator.
 Physiological effect: Current produces this effect when it passes through your bicep
(or any of your muscles for that matter) and causes the muscle to contract. This effect
is used in medicine.
Understanding Two Important Properties
of Alternating Currents
Resistance interferes with the flow of current in a circuit. But the flow of current is also
impeded by two properties of alternating currents:
 Capacitive reactance (capacitance): The storage of energy that occurs in a non-
conductor. This property resists any change in voltage in a circuit.
 Inductive reactance (inductance): The property that causes an electromotive force
(another way of saying voltage) to be induced in a circuit.
162
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 
Magnetic, electric: No, not your personality
Certain magnetic effects always accompany an electric
current, and these effects follow definite laws. In a wire,
the magnetic lines of force (these lines are imaginary
and used to explain magnetic effects) are perpendicular
to the conductor and parallel to each other.
But, when you wrap a wire around a core and pass cur-
rent through it, the wire forms a coil. As the lines of force
around the core take on a different shape, the field around
each turn of wire links with the fields from the other turns
of wire around it. The combined influence of all the turns
of wire produce a two-pole magnetic field very much like
the magnetic field of a simple bar magnet — one end of
the coil is a north pole; the other end is a south pole.
The strength of the field depends on several factors.
Here are the main ones:
 Number of turns: If you increase the number of turns,
you increase the field strength.
 Closeness of the turns: The closer the turns, the
stronger the field strength.
 Amount of current flowing: If you increase current,
you increase field strength.
 Material in the core: Most coils are either air or soft
iron. Air coils are usually wrapped around a piece of
cardboard; soft-iron coils are wrapped around a
piece of iron. Soft iron offers a better path for mag-
netic lines of force because its high permeability
offers less reluctance to magnetic flux, resulting in
more lines of force. The more lines of force, the
stronger the magnetic field.
Passing a suspended loop of conductive material (wire)
through a magnetic field performs electromagnetic
induction, which is the basic principle behind the
electric generator. Standing still, the conductor has no
current flow. But, when the conductor starts to rotate
clockwise through the lines of force of the magnets,
the lines of force induce free electrons to move through
the wire.

These two types of reactance combine to impede the flow of current. Impedance can be
expressed as the ratio of electromotive force to the current:
Impedance = Electromotive Force ÷ Current
Electronics often require specific capacitive or inductive reactance to work. Capacitors and
inductors are devices used in circuits to provide the type of reactance needed. Capacitors are
rated in microfarads (µF) and inductors are rated in millihenries (mH).
Rectifying the situation
Certain electronic circuits can change alternating current to direct current. The process of
making the change is called rectification, and the circuits that perform the rectification are
called rectifiers. Rectifiers contain semiconductor diodes (vacuum tubes with poor conduc-
tivity at low temperatures). These diodes conduct electricity in only one direction. The
process of rectification also often requires the use of inductors and capacitors (see the pre-
ceding section for more info). Rectification helps appliances run at cooler temperatures and
allows them to run at variable speeds.
Turning up the old transistor radio
A transistor is a semiconductor (an object that conducts electricity poorly at low tempera-
tures), and it has many properties:
 Transistors control the flow of electricity in a circuit.
 A transistor is usually made of germanium or silicon.
 A transistor can amplify a signal, which is why they’re used in transistor radios.
 A transistor doesn’t require a vacuum to operate.
 Transistors are small, require little power, and last a long time.
163
Chapter 13: Electronics Information
More than you ever wanted to know about 
capacitors and inductors
Capacitors store or hold a charge of electrons. In an AC
circuit, the capacitor is constantly charging and dis-
charging (AC voltage goes positive and negative in each
cycle). The rate of the charging and discharging acts as
opposition to changing AC voltage — as a resistive
effect called capacitive reactance.
Inductors are coils of wire that make use of the proper-
ties of a magnetic field. The property specifically desired
in this instance is that of the current flowing through the
wire. With full current, the magnetic field is at maximum.
However, if you take away the current, the field doesn’t
disappear immediately. It decays gradually, and the decay
continues to push electrons in the path they were going.
But, in an AC circuit, the current constantly reverses.
The rate of changing current flow, and the resulting col-
lapse and regeneration of the magnetic field in the coil,
act as opposition to changing AC current — a resistive
effect called inductive reactance.

 A transistor contains at least three terminals:
• The emitter, which gives off or emits current carriers
• The base, which controls the flow of current carriers
• The collector, which collects the current carriers
Taking a symbolic trip around an electronic circuit
Electronic circuits can be combined to create complex systems, such as those required to
operate a stereo system. Block diagrams are used to show the various combined circuits that
form a complex system.
Many of the questions on the Electronics Information subtest require you to identify an elec-
tronic component symbol and know what that component does in an electronic circuit.
Figure 13-2 shows the most common component symbols. The figure’s items are grouped
based on similarity of functions. For example, cells, batteries, DC power supplies, and AC
power supplies all have similar functions (they supply power to the circuit).
So, what do all these electronic doodads do when connected in a circuit? Each item is covered
in the list below:
 Wires: Wires are used to pass current from one part of the circuit to another. Wires
that are connected to each other are indicated by a dark circle and called joined wires.
Sometimes in complex circuit diagrams, it’s necessary to draw wires crossing even
though they aren’t connected. In this case, the dark circle is omitted, or a “hump”
symbol is drawn to make it clear the wires aren’t connected — called unjoined wires.
 Cell: A cell supplies electrical current. Some call this a battery, but technically a
battery is more than one cell. The large terminal (on the left side of the cell picture
in Figure 13-2) is positive.
 Battery: A battery is two or more cells. The large terminal (on the left side of the cell
picture in Figure 13-2) is positive.
 DC power supply: A DC power supply provides direct current electrical energy. Direct
current always flows in one direction.
 AC power supply: AC power supplies provide alternating current electrical energy.
Alternating current constantly changes direction.
 Fuse: A fuse is a safety device that “blows” (melts) if the current flowing through it
exceeds a specified value.
 Transformer: A transformer consists of two coils of wire linked by an iron core.
Transformers are used to step up (increase) and step down (decrease) AC voltages. No
electrical connection exists between the coils. Energy is transferred between the coils
by the magnetic field in the core.
 Ground: A ground is a connection to the earth.
 Lighting lamp: This transducer converts electrical energy to light, such as a light bulb
or an automobile headlight.
 Indicator lamp: This transducer converts electrical energy to light for such uses as a
warning light on a car’s dashboard.
 Motor: A motor is a transducer that converts electrical energy to kinetic energy
(motion).
164
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

 Heater: This transducer converts electrical energy to heat.
 Bells and buzzers: These transducers convert electrical energy to sound.
 Inductor: An inductor is a coil of wire that creates a magnetic field when current
passes through it. It can be used as a transducer converting electrical energy to
mechanical energy by pulling on something.

Chapter 13: Electronics Information

 Switches: Switches have many different types:
• Push switch: Allows current to flow only when the button is pressed (such as a
doorbell)
• Push-to-break switch: Normally closed (on), it’s open (off) only when the button
is pressed
• On-off switch: Allows current to flow only when it’s in the closed (on) position
• 2-way switch: Directs the flow of current to one of two routes, according to its
position
• Dual on-off switch: Often used to switch main electricity because it can isolate
both the live and neutral connections
 Resistors: Resistors restrict the flow of electric current. There are two accepted sym-
bols in use in circuit diagrams for standard (preset) resistors. Types of resistors
include
• A rheostat: A type of variable resistor with two contacts, usually used to control
current. Examples would be adjusting lamp brightness or adjusting motor speed.
• A potentiometer: A type of variable resistor with three contacts that’s used to
control voltage.
 A preset variable resistor: Operates with a small screwdriver or similar tool. It’s
designed to be set when the circuit is made and then left without further adjustment.
 Capacitors: Capacitors store electric charge. They are used with resistors in timing
circuits because it takes time for a capacitor to fill with charge. They are also used in
filter circuits because capacitors easily pass AC (changing) signals but they block DC
(constant) signals. Two types of capacitors include the following:
• Polarized capacitors must be connected the correct way round.
• Variable capacitors are used in radio tuners.
 Diodes: Diodes allow electricity to flow in only one direction. The arrow of the circuit
symbol shows the direction in which the current can flow. Diodes are the electrical
version of a valve and early diodes were actually called valves. Light Emitting Diodes
(LEDs) emit light when an electric current passes through them.
 Transistor: Transistors amplify current. For example they can be used to amplify the
small output current from a logic chip, so it can operate a lamp, relay, or other high
current device.
 Microphone: A microphone is a transducer that converts sound to electrical energy.
 Earphone and speaker: These transducers convert electrical energy to sound.
 Amplifier: An amplifier isn’t actually an electronic component but instead a complex
circuit. The block diagram symbol shows where an amplifier circuit would be con-
nected. Amplifier circuits are used to magnify power, current, or voltage.
 Antenna: A device designed to receive or transmit radio signals.
 Relay: An electrically operated switch. For example, a 9V battery circuit connected to
the coil can switch a 110V AC main circuit.
Circuit diagrams show how electronic components are connected together. Circuit diagrams
show the connections as clearly as possible with all wires drawn neatly as straight lines.
The actual layout of the components is usually quite different from the circuit diagram, how-
ever. Circuit diagrams are useful when testing a circuit and for understanding how it works.
Figure 13-3 shows a diagram of an adjustable timer circuit.

Getting Some Help: Electrical Test-Taking Tips
When it comes to the electronics test, don’t feel like you have to know as much as Ben
Franklin to get a passing score. Just use your common sense. If a question asked, “What’s the
safest way to run an extension cord to a reading light?”, the answer, “Across the middle of
the floor,” is probably going to be wrong.
You can also figure out quite a few answers if you remember these units of measure:
 Current = amperes
 Pressure = volts
 Resistance = ohms
 Power = watts
Memorizing simple principles
If you commit the following principles to memory, you’ll have an easier time succeeding on
the Electronics Information subtest:
 Ohm’s law: Current = voltage/resistance
 Power = voltage × amperes
 Electricity flows from a negative pole to a positive pole.
 A closed circuit must exist for electricity to flow. Think NASCAR.
 Alternating current (AC) changes direction constantly. The number of times a current
completes two alternations of direction per second is known as its frequency; the unit
of measurement for frequency is the hertz (Hz).
 Electronic devices operate at very high frequencies.
 Electronics often require a specific capacitive or inductive reactance to work. Capacitors
and inductors are devices used in circuits to provide the type of reactance needed.
 Devices that change alternating current to direct current are called rectifiers.
 A transistor can amplify a signal.

If you need a good score on this subtest to get your military dream job or you want to
rebuild that old television set without sacrificing your garage, you may want to consider
Electronics For Dummies by Gordon McComb and Earl Boysen (Wiley) for additional help.
Playing the guessing game
The Electronics Information subtest is the type of test where you either know the answer or
you don’t. But, if you don’t know the answer, you should still guess. Remember, you have to
answer 20 questions in 9 minutes, so you don’t have a lot of time to ponder the answer
choices. Guess and move on.
To increase your chances of guessing correctly, you can often eliminate an incorrect answer.
Sometimes one answer is obviously wrong, or one answer is more obviously right than another.
The electronics answer is usually the right answer. Therefore, an answer that has to do with
how much something costs or how pretty it looks will probably be wrong.
Not all questions are specifically electronics questions. You may be asked, “A mil measures
what quantity?” Think about how you’ve seen that prefix used before, such as in the word
millimeter. A millimeter, you may remember, is one thousandth of a meter. So you may be
safe in assuming that a mil is one thousandth of an inch.
For additional guessing help, flip back to Chapter 3.

hile much of the ASVAB measures academic knowledge at the high-school level,
here’s a subtest that probably doesn’t resemble any of your high school classes
(unless your high school offered a course in Jigsaw Puzzle 101).
The Assembling Objects subtest is designed to measure your ability to look at pieces of an
object and determine how those pieces should fit together (technically called visualizing spa-
tial relationships). Spatial skills, which help people figure out maps and interpret technical
drawings, are important to everyday living as well as to performing well in school and on the
job. Our society today places greater demands on spatial skills, such as interpretation of
graphs, maps, architectural drawings, and X-rays.
The Assembling Objects subtest is relatively new to the ASVAB. It was added when the
ASVAB was last revised, when the Numerical Operations and Coding Speed subtests were
deleted. First it was added only to the computerized version of the ASVAB, and then it was
added to the paper production (recruiting) version about a year later. If you’re taking the
high-school version of the ASVAB or the in-service version (Armed Forces Classification
Test), you won’t see this subtest.
At the time of this writing, only the navy uses the score from the Assembling Objects subtest
for job qualification purposes. Additionally, only a handful of ratings (what the navy calls
jobs) require a score in this area. The other branches don’t use the results of this subtest at
all, but they may in the future. For details about what navy enlisted jobs require a score in
this area, see the Appendix.
Getting the Picture about Assembling Objects
It’s interesting that the navy is the only service to use scores from the Assembling Objects
subtest, because it was an army study that brought this subtest to life. Way back in 1994, the
army concluded a study called Project A. (Kind of makes you wonder if the people in charge
of naming military projects were on vacation that week, doesn’t it?) Project A was all about
trying to improve the selection and classification of enlisted personnel. The Assembling
Objects subtest was a major product of this effort. The U.S. Army Research Institute for the
Behavioral and Social Sciences found Assembling Objects questions to be an excellent meas-
ure of both overall spatial ability and complex problem-solving skills.
The army developed two types of Assembling Objects questions and tested them under field
conditions for a few years. A mere ten years later, the Department of Defense incorporated
the subtests into the ASVAB. (You just got to love the speed at which the military makes

changes.) By that time, the army had decided that they really didn’t need to use this new
subtest at all. But the navy said, “Hey, that looks pretty cool . . . let’s give it a try!”
The Assembling Objects subtest consists of 16 graphical problems that must be solved in
15 minutes. That gives you a little less than a minute for each question (not counting any
time you take out to scratch your head). That’s plenty of time to finish, if you’re good at
jigsaw puzzles.
Two Types of Questions for the Price of One
The Assembling Objects subtest has two types of questions, both of which consist of five
separate drawings. In the first drawing, you see a picture with various disassembled parts,
followed by four drawings that show what the parts look like if they were assembled or con-
nected. Your task is to choose the drawing that shows what the parts might actually look like
after they’re assembled or connected properly.
Both types of problems require you to perform mental rotation — a process through which
you predict what an array of objects would look like if they were rotated on their axes by
some number of degrees.
Putting slot A into tab B: Connectors
The first type of problem presents you with simple geometric figures such as stars, cloud
shapes, letter shapes, circles, and triangles. In the first drawing you can see shapes and lines
labeled with dots and the letters A or B. These letters and dots indicate points of attachment.
The next four drawings show possible solutions of what the shapes would look like if con-
nected at designated points by the line. The shapes may be reoriented or rotated on their
axes from what you observe in the first drawing. The correct solution shows the line con-
nected correctly to reflect the points shown in the first drawing.
If a connection point in the first drawing shows a line that goes through some part of the
shape, the correct solution will also reflect this same line and point relationship. Sound
complicated? It’s not really, once you get the hang of it.
Look at Figure 14-1 and see if you can solve it. In the first drawing you see a star and a sort of
lopsided T. There’s a small dot on the short appendage of the T, labeled A, and a dot on one
of the points of the star, labeled B.
In Figure 14-1, Choice (A) is the correct solution. Choices (B) and (C) include shapes that
aren’t included in the first drawing, so they’re obviously incorrect. While Choice (D) has the
correct shapes, they aren’t connected at the same points depicted in the first drawing.
Okay that sounds simple, doesn’t it? Don’t worry; it gets more complicated (sorry to burst
your bubble). Figure 14-2 shows the same problem, but with a different twist. (Sorry, we just
couldn’t avoid the pun.)

Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

Choice (A) is the correct solution for the problem in Figure 14-2. In this case, the two shapes
have been repositioned and rotated on their axes.
Mirroring isn’t the same as rotation, as Figure 14-3 illustrates. The shape in Box B isn’t the
same as the shape in Box A. It’s a mirrored image. No matter how you rotate the shape in
Box A, it will never look like the shape in Box B. Think of it this way — while you can turn a
jigsaw puzzle shape upside down so the picture-side is facing the table, it may fit, but it’s not
the proper method of putting the puzzle together. (It wouldn’t look very pretty, either). The
Assembling Objects subtest is the same way. The possible solutions may include shapes that
are mirrors of a shape shown in the first drawing, but they’ll never be the correct solution.
If you read earlier in this section, you may remember the rule that if a shape in the first draw-
ing showed a line that went through any part of the shape, the correct solution must also
reflect the same line-shape relationship.
Check out Figure 14-4. In the first drawing, Point B is in the center of the star. But note the
line intersects the star at one of its indents and not one of its points. That means the correct
solution shows the same intersection.
In this example, Choice (B) is the correct solution. At first glance, Choice (C) looks like it
could be correct. Can you spot the reason why it’s not the correct solution? Right! The lop-
sided “T” shape in the image is a mirror of the shape shown in the first drawing.
You’re starting to see the shape of things! (Really, we’re sorry, but these little zingers just
keep popping out.) Try a couple more, just to get into shape. Look at Figure 14-5.

Chapter 14: Assembling Objects

In Figure 14-5 did you select Choice (C) as the correct answer? If so, good job! Choice (A) is
incorrect because the line intersects the triangle at the wrong point. Choice (B) is incorrect
because the weird shape is actually a mirror image of the shape shown in the first drawing.
Choice (D) is incorrect because the points don’t correlate to the points depicted in the first
drawing.
Now try Figure 14-6. The first drawing includes a shape that kind of looks like a Y, and a
shape that looks like the letter C.
The correct answer for the problem shown in Figure 14-6 is Choice (B). Choice (A) is incor-
rect because the Y shape is a mirror image of the shape shown in the first drawing, and the
connection points don’t correspond to the first drawing’s points. Choice (C) is incorrect
because the Y shape is a mirror image of the shape shown in the first drawing. Choice (D) is
incorrect because the Y shape is a different shape (the stem is much shorter) than the shape
shown in the first drawing.
Solving the Jigsaw Puzzle: Shapes
Many people may find the second type of Assembling Objects problem easier than the con-
nection problems. (This is especially true if you had the kind of parents who would buy you
jigsaw puzzles for your birthday, when what you really wanted was a brand new shiny bike.)
The second type of problem is very much like a jigsaw puzzle, except it doesn’t result in a
picture of the Statue of Liberty or a map of the United States. Also, there’s a heck of a lot
fewer pieces than that 1,000-piece puzzle your parents kept insisting on buying you. The diffi-
culty lies in the fact that you can’t use your hands to twist the pieces around on the table in
order to see how they fit. You have to rotate and move the pieces mentally.
In Figure 14-7, the solution is pretty straightforward.

By mentally sliding the shapes in the first drawing together, it’s easy to see that they fit
together to form the picture shown in Choice (A). Unfortunately, the Assembling Objects
questions on the ASVAB won’t be so simple.
Look at Figure 14-8.
Choice (A) is the correct answer. The figure shown in Choice (A) is the same as the Figure
depicted in Choice (A) of Figure 14-7, except it’s been rotated on its axis.
The previous two figures were warm-up exercises — the questions on the ASVAB are harder.
Check out Figure 14-9 for a better representation of the types of questions on the ASVAB.
If you selected Choice (D) as the correct solution, give yourself a pat on the back. Try a
couple more examples to see if you’ve gotten the hang of it. Check out Figure 14-10.
In Figure 14-10, you should’ve chosen Choice (B) as the correct answer. Mentally rotate and
relocate the pieces in the first picture until you can see how they fit together to form the
shape in Choice (B). Now try Figure 14-11.

Tips for the Assembling Objects Subtest
Researchers at the University of Chicago have determined that your basic foundation for
spatial skills is established at a very early age, perhaps as young as age 4 or 5. Unfortunately,
ladies, boys tend to have better spatial skills than girls. Scientists disagree as to why. It could
be a genetic factor, or a result of environment, or both. Young boys tend to play in a way that
encourages use of spatial skills, such as playing with blocks or building models.
Don’t worry. That doesn’t mean all is lost if you’re female. The same research has concluded
that spatial skills can be improved by engaging in activities that are spatially orientated.
Some of those activities include
 Practicing reading maps: Map reading can help you develop the ability to gauge scales
of size and direction between related objects (roads, rivers, towns, cities, and so on).
 Putting together jigsaw puzzles: This way is an obvious form of practice for improving
your spatial perceptions.
 Playing graphical computer games: Computer games may help you to improve your
spatial skills. A study conducted in the United Kingdom showed that children who
played computer games consistently scored higher on spatial aptitude tests than
children who didn’t play the games.
 Sketching: Look at an object or a picture and attempt to sketch it as viewed from a
different direction. This exercise can help you to improve your ability to mentally
visualize spatial angles.
On the Assembling Objects subtest, you can sometimes improve your odds of getting the
answer right if you select just one shape from the first drawing, and then quickly look at each
of the choices to see if that shape is represented there but in a different orientation. This
process can help you eliminate answer choices quickly that are obviously wrong.
On connection-type problems, note the position of the dot on one of the shapes in the first
drawing and then quickly scan the possible answer, eliminating any choice that depicts the
dot in a different location, or if the line passes through the shape at a different point than
shown in the first drawing.
Remember to be aware of mirror images — shapes that are reversed (instead of rotated)
from the image shown in the first drawing. The tricky test makers often make use of such
mirror representations to see if they can trick your eyes.

 Practicing your Mechanical Comprehension knowledge
 Tuning into the Electronics Information section of the ASVAB
 Building a better score on the ASVAB with an Assembling Objects practice test
I
t’s time to see a few examples of what the ASVAB technical skills questions look like.
None of these subtests are used in calculating your AFQT score (the score used to deter-
mine your general qualifications to join the military) but may be used in computing the line
score you need to get the military job you want. See the Appendix to determine whether
you need to do well on any of these subtest areas for the job that you want.
On the actual ASVAB (and on the full-length practice tests in the following chapters), you get
25 General Science questions, 25 Auto & Shop questions, 25 Mechanical Comprehension
questions, 20 Electronics Information questions, and 16 Assembling Objects graphical prob-
lems. We don’t want you to tire out too quickly, so in this chapter you get only eight sample
questions in each area.
General Science Practice Questions
General science is a hard topic to study for because the field is so broad. To score well on
this subtest you pretty much have to wade through the textbooks and memorize the facts.
You can also check out Chapter 10 for additional help. See how well you do on the following
eight practice questions.
1. If the temperature in Fahrenheit is 212 degrees, the temperature in Celsius is:
(A) 0 degrees
(B) 32 degrees
(C) 100 degrees
(D) 106 degrees
Measured in Celsius, the boiling point is 100 degrees. To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius,
use the formula, C = 5⁄9 × (F – 32). The correct answer is Choice (C).

2. Cellular activity is controlled by the:
(A) nucleus
(B) cytoplasm
(C) cell membrane
(D) vacuole
The cytoplasm is the cell’s factory, the cell membrane protects the nucleus and the cytoplasm,
and vacuoles are storage areas. The correct answer is Choice (A).
3. The human circulatory system:
(A) uses air to release energy
(B) processes food and eliminates waste
(C) moves oxygenated blood throughout the body
(D) controls movement of joints
The respiratory system uses air to release energy, the digestive system processes food and
eliminates waste, and the musculoskeletal system controls the movement of joints. So the
correct answer is Choice (C).
4. If the north pole and the south pole of a magnet come near each other, the magnets:
(A) spin
(B) attract
(C) repel
(D) melt
Opposite poles of magnets attract; like poles repel. Choice (B) is the correct answer.
5. If an atom has one proton in its nucleus and, therefore, one electron in its nucleus, it has an
atomic number of:
(A) 2
(B) 10
(C) 5
(D) 1
The atomic number corresponds with the number of electrons an atom has in its nucleus.
Choice (D) is the correct answer.
6. The element with the lowest atomic number is:
(A) hydrogen
(B) helium
(C) lithium
(D) uranium
Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. The atomic numbers for the other elements listed are
helium (2), lithium (3), and uranium (92). The correct answer is Choice (A).
176
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

7. Absolute zero is equivalent to:
(A) 0 degrees Kelvin
(B) 0 Kelvin
(C) -273.15 degrees Kelvin
(D) -273.15 Kelvin
Absolute zero is -273.15 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to 0 Kelvin. Temperatures stated
in Kelvin are measured by using units of Kelvin, not degrees. The correct answer is Choice (B).
8. Comets are composed mainly of:
(A) rock and metal alloys
(B) hydrogen and rock
(C) metal alloys and hydrogen
(D) ice and rock
Comets are snowballs composed mainly of ice and rock. The comet’s tail is formed when the
ice turns into gas from the heat of the sun. The correct answer is Choice (D).
Auto & Shop Information Practice Questions
If you like to tinker with cars and your idea of a fun weekend is to rebuild the garage, you
should do well on this subtest without too much additional study. If your idea of fixing your
car involves calling that guy down the street, a little extra study may be in order. Check out
Chapter 11 for help with this area.
9. A two-penny nail is:
(A) thicker than a 10d nail
(B) shorter than a 10d nail
(C) the same thing as a 10d nail
(D) harder than a 10d nail
Penny, abbreviated d, indicates length and thickness; a 2d nail is shorter and thinner than a
10d nail. Choice (B) is the correct answer.
10. A carburetor has the same function as a(n):
(A) distributor
(B) fuel-injection system
(C) alternator
(D) exhaust system
The alternator, exhaust system, and distributor all have very different purposes from the
carburetor, which combines the fuel and air mixture and sends it to the engine, just as the
fuel-injection system does. Therefore, Choice (B) is the correct answer.
177
Chapter 15: Facing the Facts: Technical Skills Practice Questions

11. An automotive crankshaft turns the:
(A) connecting rod
(B) rear axle
(C) flywheel
(D) cylinder
The drive shaft turns the rear axle. The cylinder contains the piston that moves the connect-
ing rod that’s connected to the crankshaft, which turns the flywheel. The correct answer is
Choice (C).
12. A hacksaw is used to cut
(A) with the grain of wood
(B) against the grain of wood
(C) round stock
(D) metal
The hacksaw has a blade specifically designed to cut metal, not wood. Choice (D) is the
correct answer.
13. To drive a cold chisel, you can use:
(A) a hammer
(B) a sledge
(C) a mallet
(D) your foot
A hammer has a smaller, harder striking surface than a mallet, which won’t damage the chisel
(or the object being chiseled, should the mallet slip off the chisel). A sledge has a cutting
edge and is inappropriate for this use. Choice (C) is the correct answer.
14. If your engine knocks or pings, the most likely cause is:
(A) faulty valves
(B) faulty cylinder
(C) low on fuel
(D) using fuel with too low of an octane rating
Using fuel with an octane rating lower than the manufacturer recommends can result in
engine knock. Choice (D) is the correct answer.
15. Antifreeze is used to:
(A) prevent the engine from overheating
(B) prevent water in the cooling system from freezing
(C) prevent damage to the engine block
(D) all of the above
Antifreeze raises the boiling point of water and lowers the freezing point. This process keeps
the water in the cooling system from boiling away. It also keeps the water from freezing. Both
conditions can cause damage to the engine. The correct answer is Choice (D).
178
Part IV: The Whole Ball of Facts: Technical Skills 

16. The best tool for cutting curves or shapes in wood is:
(A) ripsaw
(B) crosscut saw
(C) coping saw
(D) pliant saw
Coping saws have thin blades with many teeth and are specifically designed to cut curves
and shapes in wood. The correct answer is Choice (C).
Mechanical Comprehension Practice Questions
Mechanical comprehension is all about figuring out how machines and mechanical mecha-
nisms operate. A solid background in mechanical physics is a big advantage in scoring well
in this area. You can also flip back to Chapter 12 if you need additional help with mechanical
info. Basic mathematic skills are also a plus in this area. Test yourself with the next few 
questions.
17. The moisture that forms on the inside of a window on a cold day is called:
(A) condensation
(B) distillation
(C) evaporation
(D) tarnation
Distillation is the process of extracting or refining a substance; evaporation is the process of
removing moisture. Tarnation is an interjection used to express anger. The correct answer is
Choice (A).
18. If a 200-pound barrel must be lifted 4 feet to the bed of a box truck, an incline plane will
reduce the amount of effort required to move the barrel in half if the incline plane is:
(A) 2 feet long
(B) 6 feet long
(C) 8 feet long
(D) 9 feet long
The formula used for determining how an incline plane reduces effort is Length of Ramp
divided by Height of Ramp = Weight of the Object divided by Force, or x ÷ 4 = 200 ÷ 100.
(The amount of force needed to lift the object is equivalent to the object’s weight. But the
question wants to reduce that amount of force to half, so half of the object’s weight is 100.)
x ÷ 4 × 4 = 2 × 4 or x = 8. The correct answer is Choice (C).
19. Two people are carrying a 100-pound crate on a 2-x-8-x-12-inch board. To distribute the load
evenly between the two people, the crate should be placed:
(A) two feet from the end of the board
(B) in the middle of the board
(C) three feet from the end of the board
(D) the load can’t be evenly distributed
If the weight is placed closer to one or the other person, that person would carry more of the
load, so the weight should be placed in the middle. Choice (B) is the correct answer.
179
Chapter 15: Facing the Facts: Technical Skills Practice Questions

20. Wheel A has a diameter of 9 feet. Wheel B has a diameter of 12 feet. If both wheels revolve at
the same rate, Wheel B will cover a linear distance of 24 feet:
(A) at the same speed as Wheel A
(B) more slowly than Wheel A
(C) in half the time of Wheel A
(D) faster than Wheel A
Because Wheel A has less surface area, it covers a shorter linear distance than Wheel B when
turning at the same rate. Thus, Wheel B covers the distance of 24 feet faster than Wheel A.
Choice (D) is the correct answer.
21. A stationary single pulley (not including friction) gives a mechanical advantage of:
(A) 2
(B) 4
(C) 3
(D) 1
A stationary single pulley allows you to change the direction of force but doesn’t result in an
increased mechanical advantage. The correct answer is Choice (D).
22. There are four gears connected in a series. If Gear #1 is turning clockwise, Gear #4 will turn:
(A) clockwise
(B) counterclockwise
(C) faster than Gear #1
(D) slower than Gear #1
Gears connected in series turn in opposite directions of each other. The correct answer is
Choice (B).
23. The sideways force one feels when a car turns sharply is called:
A) thrust force
(B) angle force
(C) centrifugal force
(D) positive force
Centrifugal force isn’t actually a force at all but rather a property of Newton’s laws of motion.
The correct answer is Choice (C).
24. When two or more forces act to balance each other out, the condition is called:
(A) equilibrium
(B) static recoil
(C) gravitational balance
(D) concurrent forces
When two or more forces interact so that their combination cancels the other(s) out, there’s
a state of equilibrium. In this state the velocity of an object doesn’t change. Choice (A) is the
correct answer.

Assembling Objects Practice Questions
Assembling Objects questions measure your spatial skills. There are two types of questions:
connection questions and putting pieces together questions.
The first type of problem presents you with simple geometric figures such as stars, cloud
shapes, letter shapes, circles, and triangles. Your task is to choose the answer that shows
the shapes properly connected together at the designated points. The second type of ques-
tion is similar to putting a jigsaw puzzle together. Choose the answer that best shows what the
shapes in the first drawing would look like, if assembled together.
See Chapter 14 for a complete explanation and illustrated examples.

oing well on the ASVAB requires an effective study
plan. You want to concentrate your study time on
subject areas you may be having problems with. The prac-
tice examinations in this part are great tools to enhance
and plan your study program. 
Take the first test in this section to determine your strengths
and weaknesses. Concentrate most of your study efforts on
subject areas that are hard for you. When you think you’ve
got it down, take the second test to measure your improve-
ment. Take the third test right before you’re ready to take
the actual ASVAB to brush up on your test-taking skills.
In this part, you also find a bonus Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) practice exam. This practice
test includes only the four ASVAB subtests that are used
to make up your AFQT score — the score that determines
whether you can even join the military branch of your
choice.
Taking the sample tests helps you understand where you
need to study, but it also gets you into the test-taking mind-
set. By taking the tests, you get used to the format of each
subtest. Trust us — these sample tests give you confidence
on test day.

Chapter 16
Practice Exam 1
T
his sample test features nine subtests, just like the actual ASVAB. As you may have
guessed, the sample tests in this book are paper-based tests. (Yes, we’re the masters of
the obvious.) When you take the actual ASVAB, it may be a paper-based or a computer-
based exam. The computer version follows the same format as the paper version. (Check
out the computer-based test in greater detail in Chapter 3.) The only real differences are
that on the computer-based test, you can’t skip a question and go back to it, and you can’t
change an answer after you enter it into the computer.
To get the most out of this sample test, take it like you’d take the real ASVAB under the same
conditions:
1. Allow yourself about three hours to take the entire exam, and take the whole thing
at one time.
2. Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted.
3. Bring a timer that you can set for various lengths of time, some scratch paper, and a
pencil.
4. At the start of each subtest, set your timer for the specified period of time.
Don’t go on to the next section until the timer has gone off, and don’t go back to a pre-
vious section. If you finish early, check your work for that section only.
5. Use the answer sheet that’s provided.
6. Don’t take a break during any subtest.
You can take a short one- or two-minute break between subtests if you need it.
After you complete the entire sample test, check your answers against the answer key in
Chapter 17. Remember that the test is scored by comparing your raw score to the scores of
other people, which produces a scaled score. So just because you missed a total of 20 ques-
tions doesn’t mean that your score is 80 (that would be too simple). Turn to Chapter 1 to find
out how the ASVAB is scored.
Your primary goal with this sample test is to determine your strengths and weaknesses. If
you only miss one question on the Word Knowledge subtest but you miss 15 on Arithmetic
Reasoning, you know where to spend your study time. If you’re not going to pursue a career
that requires a score on a particular subtest or the type of knowledge a subtest covers, don’t
worry about your score. (See the Appendix for more information on the subtests various
careers require good scores on.) Go ahead and take the sample test like it’s the actual ASVAB,
but don’t worry about your score.

An important stage of personal time man-
agement is to take control of appointments.
Determined by external obligation, appoint-
ments constitute interaction with other
people and an agreed-on interface between
your activities and those of others. Start
with a simple appointment diary. List all
appointments including regular and recur-
ring ones. Now, be ruthless and eliminate
the unnecessary. There may be committees
where you can’t productively contribute or
where a subordinate may be able to partici-
pate. Eliminate the waste of your time.
Effectively managing your appointments
allows you to:
(A) spend more time with your subordinates
(B) delegate responsibility to subordinates
(C) make more efficient use of your time
(D) attend only the most important meetings

(such as the United States). Indo-European
languages are also spoken in India, Iran,
parts of western Afghanistan, and in some
areas of Asia.
The author of this passage would agree that:
(A) Indo-European languages are spoken in
areas all over the world.
(B) Indo-European languages include all
the languages spoken in the world.
(C) Only Europeans speak Indo-European
languages.
(D) Indo-European language speakers can

In privatization, the government relies on
the private sector to provide a service.
However, the government divests itself of
the entire process, including all assets. With
privatized functions, the government may
specify quality, quantity, and timeliness
requirements, but it has no control over the
operations of the activity. Also, the govern-
ment may not be the only customer.
Whoever the government chooses to pro-
vide the services would likely provide the
same services to others.
This paragraph best supports the state-
ment that:
(A) The government must closely super-
vise privatized functions.
(B) Privatized functions consist of a mix-
ture of government employees, military
personnel, and private contractors.
(C) Privatized functions are those institu-
tions that provide services only to a
government agency.
(D) Privatized functions provide essential
services to the government.

The success or failure of a conference lies
largely with its leader. A leader’s zest and
enthusiasm must be real, apparent, and
contagious. The leader is responsible for
getting the ball rolling and making the atten-
dees feel as if the meeting is theirs and its
success depends on their participation. A
good, thorough introduction helps establish
the right climate.
A good title to this paragraph would be:
(A) Lead by Example
(B) The Importance of Proper
Introductions
(C) Leading a Successful Conference
(D) Conference Participation Basics

Cloud seeding is accomplished by dropping
particles of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide)
from a plane onto super-cooled clouds. This
process encourages condensation of water
droplets in the clouds, which usually, but
not always, results in rain or snow.
From this passage, it’s reasonable to
assume that:
(A) Cloud seeding could be used to end a
drought.
(B) Cloud seeding is prohibitively expensive.
(C) Cloud seeding is rarely used.
(D) Cloud seeding can be accomplished by
using regular ice.

To write or not to write — that is the ques-
tion. If assigned a writing task, there’s no
option. However, if someone is looking for a
specific answer, find out if they need a short
answer or a detailed one. Can the require-
ment be met with a telephone call, e-mail,
or short note, or is something more neces-
sary? A former CEO of a major corporation
once commented that he had looked at
13,000 pieces of paper in a 5-day period.
Think how much easier and more economi-
cal it would be if people would use the tele-
phone, send an e-mail, or write a short note.
The main point of this passage is:
(A) Written records are important as they
provide detailed documentation.
(B) More business people should invest
time and energy improving their writing
skills.
(C) Writing may not be the best way to
communicate information.
(D) It’s pointless for business people to
spend time improving their writing
skills.

The transistor, a small, solid-state device
that can amplify sound, was invented in
1947. At first, it was too expensive and too
difficult to produce to be used in cheap,
mass-market products. By 1954, though,
these cost and production problems had
been overcome, and the first transistor
radio was put on the market.
According to this passage:
(A) There was no market for transistors
before 1954.
(B) When transistors could be produced
cheaply and easily, the transistor radio
was put on the market.
(C) Transistors were invented in 1947 by
order of the Department of Defense.
(D) Transistors are still expensive to
produce.

I returned from the City about three o’clock
on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted
with life. I had been three months in the
Old Country and was fed up with it. If
people had told me a year ago that I
would’ve been feeling like that I should’ve
laughed at them; but there was the fact.
The weather made me liverish, the talk of the
ordinary Englishman made me sick, I couldn’t
get enough exercise, and the amusements of
London seemed as flat as soda water that
had been standing in the sun.
The author is speaking of his travels in:

Surveys show that the average child under
the age of 18 watches four hours of televi-
sion per day. Although some of the pro-
gramming may be educational, most isn’t.
Spending this much time watching televi-
sion interferes with a child’s ability to
pursue other interests, such as reading,
participating in sports, and playing with
friends.
The author of this passage would agree
that:
(A) Television viewing should be restricted.
(B) Parents who let their children watch
this much television are neglectful.
(C) Reading, participating in sports, play-
ing with friends, and watching televi-
sion should all be given equal time.
(D) Adults over 18 can watch as much tele-
vision as they want.

High-school and college graduates attempting to
find jobs should participate in mock job inter-
views. These mock interviews help students pre-
pare for the types of questions they’ll be asked,
make them more comfortable with common inter-
view formats, and help them critique their per-
formance before facing a real interviewer.
Because they’re such a valuable aid, schools
should organize mock job interviews for all of
their graduating students.
11.
The above passage states that mock job
interviews:
(A) frighten students
(B) should be offered to the best students
(C) help prepare students for real job
interviews
(D) should be organized by students
12.
From the above passage, it is reasonable to
assume that:
(A) Mock interviews can increase a stu-
dent’s confidence when he or she goes
into a real job interview.
(B) Mock interviews are expensive to
organize.
(C) Few students are interested in mock
interviews.
(D) Students don’t need job interview
preparation.
Due process, the guarantee of fairness in the admin-
istration of justice, is part of the 5th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment further
requires states to abide by due process. After this
amendment was enacted, the U.S. Supreme Court
struck down many state laws that infringed on
the civil rights guaranteed to citizens in the Bill of
Rights.
13.
According to the above passage, due
process:
(A) is an outdated concept
(B) guarantees fairness in the justice
system
(C) never became part of the U.S.
Constitution
(D) is the process by which winning lottery
tickets are selected
14.
According to the above passage, it’s reason-
able to assume that the 5th Amendment:
(A) is about taxes
(B) guarantees due process in all criminal
and civil cases
(C) guarantees due process in federal law
(D) should never have become part of the
Bill of Rights
15.
The author of the above passage would
agree that:
(A) Without the passage of the 14th
Amendment, many laws restricting civil
rights would still exist in various states.
(B) The Supreme Court overstepped its
jurisdiction when it struck down laws
infringing on citizens’ civil rights.
(C) The Supreme Court had every right to
strike down state laws before the pas-
sage of the 14th Amendment.
(D) The 14th Amendment was opposed by
all states.

Practice Exam 1: 
Answers and Explanations
W
ith the first practice test out of the way, you’re probably anxious to see how well
you did. Use the answer keys in this chapter to score yourself on each of the nine
subtests. Remember, your scores on this practice exam don’t equate to scores on the actual
ASVAB. That’s because on the production ASVAB, you get more points for answering harder
questions correctly than you do for easier questions. The practice exam, however, is a valu-
able tool for determining what subject areas you need to brush up on.
Part 1: General Science Answers
The General Science subtest tests your knowledge of science facts. If you missed a few ques-
tions, reread the questions and try to figure out where you went wrong. If you missed more
than a few questions, review Chapter 10.
General Science is a broad field, but some of the following books published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc. may help you: Chemistry For Dummies by John T. Moore, Biology For Dummies
by Donna Rae Siegfried, Astronomy For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephen P. Maran, Weather
For Dummies by John D. Cox, and Physics For Dummies by Steve Holzner, Ph.D. Additional

Part 2: Arithmetic Reasoning Answers
The Arithmetic Reasoning subtest is one of the four ASVAB subtests that make up your
Armed Force Qualifying Test (AFQT) score. This score is important because it determines
whether you qualify to join the service branch of your choice (check the Appendix to see if
the jobs you’re interested in require a score in this subtest). If you missed more than five or
six questions, it’s time to dig out that old high school math textbook and wrap your brain
around some math problems. Chapters 7 and 8 may also help you out.

Some other great books that may help you score better on this subtest include Algebra
For Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies
by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For Dummies by Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math For Dummies by
Scott Hatch — all published by Wiley Publishing, Inc. Also see Chapter 9 for additional
practice questions.
1. (C). Multiply 12 miles by $3.50 per mile to get $42.00.
2. (A). Let x = the smaller number and x + 8 equal the larger number. Because the sum of the
two numbers equals 70, you can express this mathematically as x + (x + 8) = 70. Now all you
have to do is solve for x. Combine the like terms: 2x + 8 = 70. Then subtract 8 from both
sides of the equation: 2x + 8 – 8 = 70 – 8, or 2x = 62. Divide both sides of the equation by two,
and you find that x is equal to 31.
3. (D). 144 bottles are in a gross. 144 ÷ 3 (bottles per day) = 48 days.
4. (B). To determine Jenny’s average, add the test scores and divide the sum by the number
of tests taken. You want to know what she would need to make on the next test in order
to achieve an average of 95. The formula can be set up as (93 + 89 + 96 + 98 + x) ÷ 5 = 95.
Combining the like terms results in (376 + x) ÷ 5 = 95. Multiplying both sides by 5 results in
376 + x = 475. So, x = 99.
5. (B). Multiply the total amount spent on drinks, $375, by 12% to determine the amount of
tips. $375 × 0.12 = $45.
6. (D). Square footage is determined by multiplying length by width, or 12 × 12 = 144.
7. (C). To determine the number of square yards to be protected, multiply 16 feet by 18 feet
to determine the number of square feet, 288. Then divide 288 by 9 to convert square feet
to square yards (1 square yard = 3 feet × 3 feet = 9 square feet). Multiply the quotient, 32
square yards, by the cost of protection per square yard, $0.65, to get the correct answer,
$20.80. Remember to perform all the steps in a calculation.
8. (C). Let x = the number of cards printed and sold each month. Therefore, cost is equal to
6000 + 18x, and revenue is equal to 0.30x. You’re looking for the point where revenue is
greater than the cost (revenue > cost). The inequity is 0.30x > 6000 + 18x. Subtracting 18x
from both sides of the inequity results in 0.12x > 6000. Divide both sides by 0.12. The result
is that x > 50,000. The printing plant would have to print and sell 50,000 cards per month to
make a profit.
9. (C). To calculate the new wage, start off by multiplying $8.15 × 0.07 = $0.57. Then add that
number (the amount of Joe’s raise) to his original hourly wage. Joe’s new hourly wage is
$8.15 + $0.57 = $8.72.
10. (C). By the time Dave leaves, Alice has already been traveling for half an hour. Three hours
later, she would’ve been traveling for 31⁄2 hours at 45 mph, or 157.5 miles. In order to travel
157.5 miles in 3 hours, Dave would have to travel at 55.5 mph (divide 157.5 by 3).
11. (D). Convert the different denominators to a common denominator that all the denomina-
tors can divide into evenly. 4, 3, and 6 all divide evenly into 12. To convert 1⁄4 to x⁄12, divide 12
(the new common denominator) by 4 (the old common denominator) to get 3. Then multi-
ply 1⁄4 by 3⁄3 (another way of saying 1). The product is 3⁄12. (1⁄4 = 3⁄12).
Do the same calculation for the other fractions: 1⁄3 = 4⁄12 and 1⁄6 = 2⁄12. Then add the new numera-
tors together: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9. This gives you your new added numerator. Place the added
numerator over the new denominator, and you can see that 9⁄12 of the pies have been sold.
9⁄12 can be reduced to 3⁄4. 3⁄4 or 75% of the pies have been sold. 20 × 0.75 = 15. 15 of 20 pies have
been sold. 20 – 15 = 5 pies remaining.
12. (A). Subtract the sale price from the regular price: $24.00 – $22.50 = $1.50. Multiply the
remainder by the number of cases to get your answer: $1.50 × 5 = $7.50.
220
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

13. (C). Divide 30 by 8 to determine that the security guard takes 3.75 minutes to walk one city
block. Multiply 3.75 by 6, the number of blocks it takes to complete the circuit, to arrive at
22.50, or 221⁄2 minutes.
14. (B). Let x = the original estimate. An additional one-fifth would be 6⁄5x, or 120% of x. The equa-
tion can be expressed as 1.2x = 600000. To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by
1.2. x = 500,000.
15. (D). Divide the number of questions she must get right (40) by the total number of questions
(60) to reach 662⁄3 %.
16. (C). To determine the amount of interest earned, multiply the principal ($3,000) by the inter-
est rate (6%) and the number of years interest accrues (1 year): $3,000 × 0.06 × 1 = $180.
Add the interest earned to the principal to show how much total money the teacher would
have: $180 + $3,000 = $3,180.
17. (B). Divide the total number of laps by the length of one lap. 31⁄2 ÷ 1⁄4. First, convert the mixed
number to a fraction, then divide by 1⁄4. 7⁄2 ÷ 1⁄4 = 28⁄2, which can be reduced to 14.
18. (A). A kilometer is 5⁄8 of a mile, so multiply 75 × 5⁄8, or 75⁄1 × 5⁄8 = 375⁄8. Divide 8 into 375 to reduce
the fraction and determine that Karl was traveling at 47 miles per hour.
19. (A). $12.30 × 40 hours = $492, his base pay per week. $12.30 × 1.5 = $18.45, his overtime rate
per hour. $18.45 (overtime rate per hour) × 6 (hours of overtime) = $110.70 (overtime pay).
$492.00 (base pay) + $110.70 (overtime pay) = $602.70 (total pay for the week).
20. (A). The office has 1,260 square feet of space (multiply 42 square feet by 30 employees).
With 35 employees, each employee will have 36 square feet of work space (1,260 ÷ 35),
which is 6 square feet less than originally.
21. (B). Five years contain 60 months, so multiply $450 (monthly payment) × 60 = $27,000
(total payments). Then add $27,000 (total payments) + $2,000 (down payment) = $29,000
(total cost).
22. (D). Add the three monthly amounts to determine the total amount Darla spent on groceries:
$120.37 + $108.45 + $114.86 = $343.68. Divide the total by 3 to determine the average monthly
cost: $114.56.
23. (C). 1,650 miles (total distance) ÷ 50 miles per hour (average speed) = 33 hours.
24. (B). Determine the cost of each option. Choice (A) doesn’t provide enough paint (2 × 25 gal-
lons = 50 gallons). Choice (B): 11 × $108 = $1,188. Choice (C): 6 × $215 = $1,290. Choice (D):
55 × $23 = $1,265. The lowest price is $1,188.
25. (B). One ton = 2,000 pounds, so one truck can carry 6,000 pounds. There are 16 ounces in a
pound, so one truck can carry 96,000 ounces. The total daily ration for each resident is 12
ounces + 18 ounces + 18 ounces, or 48 ounces. The number of daily rations supplied can be
expressed as 96,000 ÷ 48 = 2,000. Dividing 2,000 by 10 days results in 200 residents who can
be fed by one truck during this 10-day period.
26. (D). The train headed for Wichita traveled 55 miles per hour × 3 hours = 165 total miles. The
train headed for Des Moines traveled 70 miles per hour × 3 hours = 210 total miles. Adding
the distances together gives you the number of miles apart the two trains were after three
hours: 210 + 165 = 375. Another option: You can add the two rates of speed (55 + 70) and
multiply the sum by 3 hours (125 × 3 hours = 375).
27. (A). Convert the mixed number to inches. 3 feet 8 inches equals 44 inches (12 inches per
foot × 3 feet = 36 inches + 8 inches = 44 inches). 44 inches (length each section needs to be) 
× 4 (number of sections needed) = 176 inches (total molding needed). To determine the
amount of molding needed in feet, convert 176 inches into feet by dividing 176 inches by
12 inches. You get 142⁄3 feet, so the shortest board length is 15 feet.
28. (A). One turkey breast costs $8.50 minus 10% of $8.50, or $8.50 – $0.85 = $7.65. The other
turkey breast is full price. $7.65 + $8.50 = $16.15.
221
Chapter 17: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

29. (C). Don’t let the number of miles traveled confuse you — you don’t use them to solve the
problem. 2⁄5 of a 40-hour workweek is 2⁄5 × 40⁄1 = 80⁄5. Reduce the fraction: 80 ÷ 5 = 16 hours per
week spent traveling.
30. (B). Your first step is to determine the number of miles traveled. Multiply the rate of travel
by the time. 48 × 7 = 336 miles. The amount of gas used is the total miles driven, divided by
the number of miles per gallon. 336 ÷ 21 = 16 gallons of gasoline used. At the price of $2.82
per gallon, you spent $45.12 for gas ($2.82 × 16 = $45.12).
Part 3: Word Knowledge Answers
The Word Knowledge subtest is nothing more than a vocabulary test. However, it’s very
important because it’s another one of the four subtests used to make up your AFQT score.
If you find you need to improve your vocabulary, see Chapter 4.
A couple of other great study references are Vocabulary For Dummies by Laurie E. Rozakis
(Wiley) and SAT Vocabulary For Dummies by Suzee Vlk (Wiley). Additionally, see Chapter 6

Part 4: Paragraph Comprehension Answers
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest can be a bit tricky. But you need to get a good score on
this subtest to enlist and get the career you want (check the Appendix to see if the jobs you’re
interested in require a score in this subtest). So pay special attention if you’ve missed more
than a couple of these answers — you need some study time (see Chapter 5). Remember that
rereading the paragraph several times to make sure that you have the right answer is perfectly
fine. The best method of improving your reading comprehension skills is simply to read more.
Additional practice questions can be found in Chapter 6.
1. (C). Effective appointment management eliminates the waste of your time, as explained in
the last sentence of the passage.
2. (D). The passage gives the numbers of senators and representatives, so Choice (A) is incor-
rect. The passage states that each state’s population determines the number of representa-
tives a state has, so Choice (B) is incorrect. As stated in the passage, each state has at least
one representative, so Choice (C) is incorrect.
222
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

3. (A). Many languages are excluded from the Indo-European language group, so Choice (B) is
incorrect. Indians, Iranians, Asians, and Afghans aren’t Europeans, so Choice (C) is incor-
rect. The passage gives no evidence to support Choice (D), which isn’t true.
4. (D). Privatized functions operate independently of the government, making Choices (A) and
(B) incorrect. The passage states that privatized functions may sell goods and services to
other customers as well as the government, so Choice (C) is also incorrect. Choice (D) is
the correct answer, as privatized functions do perform essential services to government
agencies.
5. (C). Choice (A) is always a good philosophy but isn’t pertinent to the main point of the
passage. Choices (B) and (D) are subpoints, which support the main point of the passage,
which is how to lead a successful conference.
6. (A). One can assume that causing rain or snow would end a drought. Nothing in the passage
has to do with expense, so Choice (B) is incorrect. The passage says nothing about how
frequently the process is used, so Choice (C) is incorrect. The passage specifies that dry
ice (solid carbon dioxide) is used; solid water (regular ice) is a different chemical, so
Choice (D) is wrong.
7. (C). Choices (A) and (B) may be true in certain situations, but they’re not the point of this
particular paragraph. The passage doesn’t say anything about working to improve writing
skills being a waste of time, so Choice (D) is incorrect. The main point of the paragraph is
that writing may not be the most efficient way of communicating, depending on the situation.
8. (B). Products with transistors weren’t widely sold before 1954 because of the expense and
difficulty of production, not because markets didn’t exist; so Choice (A) is incorrect.
Choices (C) and (D) aren’t supported in the passage. The passage states that the problem
of transistors being expensive and difficult to produce was solved by 1954.
9. (B). The words London and Englishmen make it clear that the author is speaking of his travels
in England (Great Britain).
10. (A). The author makes no reference to parents in the passage, so Choice (B) is incorrect. The
author doesn’t imply anything about all these interests requiring equal time, so Choice (C) is
incorrect. The passage is about children under 18; no conclusion can be drawn about what
the author thinks people over 18 should do, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
11. (C). The passage doesn’t say anything about mock job interviews being frightening, so
Choice (A) is wrong. The passage says that mock job interviews should be available to all
students, so Choice (B) is wrong. The passage says that schools, not students, should
organize mock interviews, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
12. (A). Choices (B), (C), and (D) are the opposite of what the paragraph states and implies.
13. (B). Nothing in the paragraph supports Choice (A), which is incorrect. When an amendment is
passed, it becomes part of the Constitution, so Choice (C) is incorrect. The passage doesn’t
support Choice (D).
14. (C). Because the 14th Amendment guarantees due process in states’ laws, the 5th
Amendment must guarantee due process only in federal law. Nothing in the passage implies
that the 5th Amendment is about taxes, so Choice (A) is wrong. Because the passage states
that the 14th Amendment had to be enacted to require states to abide by due process,
Choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is neither stated nor implied in the passage.
15. (A). Because the Supreme Court struck down many state laws after the 14th Amendment
was enacted, it’s probably true that these laws would still exist if there had been no 14th
Amendment. The passage doesn’t support Choices (B), (C), or (D).

Chapter 17: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

Part 5: Mathematics Knowledge Answers
This subtest is also used to calculate your AFQT score, so it’s important. If you miss more
than four or five, you should consider brushing up on your basic math skills. Chapter 8 can
help with this.
The following Dummies books may also be of some help: Algebra For Dummies and Algebra II
For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For
Dummies by Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math For Dummies by Scott Hatch (all books published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.). Chapter 9 also has some additional practice questions.
1. (A). Substitute 8 for x in the equation. y = (x2 ÷ 4) – 2. y = (82 ÷ 4) – 2. y = (64 ÷ 4) – 2. 
y = 16 – 2. y = 14.
2. (A). The cube of 5 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125.
3. (C). 2.5 × 33 = 2.5 (3 × 3 × 3) = 2.5 × 27 = 67.50.
4. (D). 24 = 16; the fourth root of 16 is 2.
5. (A). The slope of the line is equal to the change in y values divided by the change in x values.
The change in y values is 4 (3 –  –1). The change in x values is 2 (2 – 0). 4⁄2 = 2. To find the
intercept, substitute 0 for x in the equation y = 2x + b. –1 = 2(0) + b. Therefore, b = –1, so the
equation is y = 2x – 1.
6. (C). Convert 12 yards and 14 feet to feet: (12 yards × 3 feet per yard) + 14 feet = 36 feet +
14 feet = 50 feet. Divide by 5 as instructed: 50 feet ÷ 5 = 10 feet.
7. (D). If two powers have the same base, they can be multiplied by keeping the base and
adding the powers together.
8. (D). Multiply the first variable in the first set of parentheses with the first variable in the
second set of parentheses (x × x = x2). Next, multiply the first variable in the first set of paren-
theses with the second number in the second set of parentheses (x × 2 = 2x). So far, the results
are x2 + 2x. Now, multiply the second number in the first set of parentheses to the first vari-
able in the second set of parentheses (4 × x = 4x). Next, multiply the second variable in the
first set of parentheses to the second number in the second set of parentheses (4 × 2 = 8). The
solution is x2 + 2x + 4x + 8. Combining the like terms results in x2 + 6x + 8.
9. (C). 1.5 × 103 = 1.5 × (10 × 10 × 10) = 1.5 × 1,000 = 1,500.
10. (B). A prime number is a number that can be divided evenly by itself or by one, but not by
any other number. Choices (A), (C), and (D) can all be divided evenly by other numbers.
11. (B). The mode of a series of numbers is the number that appears in the series the most fre-
quently. In this case, it’s 8.
12. (D). Substitute 4 for all a’s in the problem. 43 ÷ 4 = (4 × 4 × 4) ÷ 4 = 64 ÷ 4 = 16.
13. (C). The factorial (!) of a number is the number multiplied by the next smallest whole number,
then by the next smallest whole number, and so on (down to 1). 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
14. (B). (900 × 2) ÷ 6 = 1,800 ÷ 6 = 300.
15. (A). Substitute 2 for all x’s in the problem. 22 × 2 = 4 × 2 = 8.
16. (D). Solve the first half of the equation. (6) (2) (3) = 36. Therefore, 36 = (3 + 3)x, which turns
into 36 = 6x. Isolate x.
36 ÷ 6 = 6x ÷ 6
6 = x
To check your answer, substitute 6 for x.
224
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

17. (A). The square root of 49 is 7; the square root of 64 is 8. 7 × 8 = 56.
18. (D). Find a common denominator for the fractions. In this case, 80 works for all the frac-
tions. Convert all the fractions: 2⁄5 = 32⁄80; 3⁄8 = 30⁄80; 7⁄10 = 56⁄80; and 13⁄16 = 65⁄80. Comparing the fractions,
you can see that 13⁄16 (65⁄80) is the largest fraction.
19. (B). Solve as you would solve for any unknown. 2 + x ≥4 = 2 + x – 2 ≥4 – 2. Or, x ≥2. To check
your answer, substitute 2 for x. 2 + 2 ≥4. True, so the answer is correct.
20. (C). Circumference equals pi × diameter, and diameter is equal to two times the radius. Or
C = ÷ d, and d = 2r. C = ÷ 24. If you round ÷ to 3.14, the answer is about 75.36 or about 75 feet.
21. (A). Volume equals length × width × height (V = lwh). 16 × 8 × 18 = 2,304 cubic inches.
22. (C). In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are equal.
23. (A). All quadrilaterals have angles that total 360 degrees.
24. (B). If the sum of two angles equals 90 degrees, they’re called complementary angles.
25. (A). 24% = 24⁄100. This fraction can be further reduced to 6⁄25.
Part 6: Electronics Information Answers
The Electronics Information subtest is important only if you plan on a career that requires
a solid score in this area (check the Appendix to see if the jobs you’re interested in require a
score in this subtest). Otherwise, spend your time studying for the math- and word-related
ASVAB subtests. If you do need to score big on this test, and you missed more than five
answers, start brushing up. Start by reviewing the corresponding chapter in this book
(Chapter 13).
If you need even more study, consider Electronics For Dummies by Gordon McComb (Wiley)
or consider enrolling in a quick course at a community college. You can also find additional
practice questions in Chapter 15.
1. (A). Ohm’s law states that Voltage (V) = Current (I) × Resistance (R). All other answer are
incorrect expressions of this law.
2. (D). Iron is easily magnetized and demagnetized, so it works well for this device.
3. (C). A bridge rectifier is also known as a full wave rectifier, usually containing 8 diodes.
4. (C). The number of times alternating current changes direction in one second is known as
its frequency, which is measured in hertz.
5. (A). SIM stands for Subscriber Identity Module. The card contains information such as your
phone number, your billing information, and your address book. It makes it easier to switch
from one cell phone to another.
6. (D). Voltage, ohms, and amperes are always present when current flows through a wire.
7. (B). Inductors are rated in millihenries.
8. (C). Radar can operate as high as 100,000 MHz (megahertz).
9. (A). Radio waves travel at the speed of light. The speed of sound is much slower.
10. (C). Changing AC to DC is a process called rectification.
11. (D). Insulated fittings replace soldering.
12. (A). This symbol stands for battery.
13. (B). This is true, even if the cable has a 25-pin connector. Serial cables are often used to
connect computers to perpetual devices.
225
Chapter 17: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

14. (A). Connecting capacitors in parallel produces more capacitance.
15. (A). Power = Current × Voltage or, written another way, Current = Power/Voltage. 60⁄120 = 0.5
ampere.
16. (C). The larger the number, the smaller (in diameter) the wire.
17. (C). Because fuses are designed to prevent current overload at a specific level, a fuse with a
high rating may not work properly for a circuit rated at a lower level.
18. (A). Neutral wire is always whitish or natural colored.
19. (D). Electrical power is measured in watts, so you use a wattmeter.
20. (B). The bulb will burn dimmer because its full potential isn’t used; it will last longer for the
same reason.
Part 7: Auto & Shop Information Answers
The Auto & Shop Information subtest is fairly straightforward. You either know the informa-
tion or you don’t. Not knowing the info may not matter to you as long as the career you want
doesn’t require a subtest score in this area (check the Appendix to see if the jobs you’re
interested in require a score in this subtest). But, if you do need to do well on this subtest,
and you’ve missed more than five answers, you need to review the material in Chapter 11.
Reviewing Auto Repair For Dummies by Deanna Sclar (Wiley) may also help you score better
on this subtest. Home Improvement All-in-One For Dummies by Roy Barnhart, James Carey,
Morris Carey, Gene Hamilton, Katie Hamilton, Donald R. Prestly, and Jeff Strong (Wiley) can
help you get a better handle on basic tools and their uses. You may even want to take a class
at a nearby community college or at least hang out at the garage and help some mechanics
for a couple of weeks. See Chapter 15 for some more practice questions.

Part 8: Mechanical Comprehension Answers
The Mechanical Comprehension subtest is important only if you want to pursue a military
career that requires a good score on this subtest (check the Appendix to see if the jobs
you’re interested in require a score in this subtest). Otherwise, spend your time studying
more important areas of the ASVAB. If you’re considering a military job that requires a high
mechanical aptitude and you missed more than four or five questions on this subtest, give
Chapter 12 another once over.
Physics For Dummies by Steve Holzner, Ph.D. (Wiley) may help you to get a better grasp on the
various forces applicable to mechanics. Chapter 15 has some additional practice questions.
226
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

1. (A). An induction clutch is a magnetic clutch.
2. (B). Mechanical advantage can be calculated as Length of Effort Arm ÷ Length of Resistance
Arm. MA = 8 ÷ 2 = 4.
3. (D). The box with the largest area on the bottom will have the shortest sides. If length ×
width × height = volume, and all the boxes have equal volume, then the sides must be short-
est on the box with the largest area on the bottom. Calculate the area of each box bottom:
No. 1 = 20 square inches; No. 2 = 35 square inches; No. 3 = 48 square inches; and No. 4 = 27
square inches. No. 3, which has the largest area, will have the shortest sides.
4. (C). Cat B landing on the seesaw will propel Cat A into the air.
5. (A). Power equals force divided by area in square inches (P = F⁄A). This formula can also be
stated as F = A × P. Substitute the known quantities. F = 15 × 24 = 360 pounds.
6. (C). Recoil occurs when an object producing a force is kicked back.
7. (A). To determine the answer, multiply the number of teeth Gear 1 has (D) and the number
of revolutions it makes (R). Divide that number by the number of teeth Gear 2 has (d) to
determine the number of revolutions Gear 2 makes (r). Because the gears are proportional,
this formula will show you the ratio of teeth to revolutions.
r = DR/d
r = (25 × 10)/15
r = 250⁄15, or 1610⁄15, or 162⁄3
8. (B). You can determine the pressure of all that water by multiplying the volume of the aquar-
ium by the weight of the water. Volume = lwh. The bottom of the tank is 18 feet long  by 12
feet wide by 10 feet high for a total volume of 2,160 cubic feet (18 × 12 × 10). A cubic foot of
water weighs approximately 62.5 pounds. 2,160 × 62.5 gives an approximate pressure on the
bottom of the tank of about 135,000 pounds over the entire surface area. The surface area of
the bottom of the tank is length × width. 216 inches (18 feet × 12) × 144 inches (12 feet × 12) =
31,104. Dividing the pressure of 135,000 by the number of square inches of surface area gives
an approximate PSI of 4.
9. (D). Machine springs are usually made of steel although sometimes they’re made of brass or
other metal alloys.
10. (B). Clutches connect and disconnect parts, so they’re a type of coupling.
11. (D). When the high point of the cam connects with the lever arm, the lever arm will touch
the contact point. Two high points on the cam mean the lever arm will touch the contact
point twice with each revolution of the cam.
12. (C). A single block-and-fall is called a runner.
13. (C). If the fulcrum is moved closer to the cat, the length of the effort arm of the lever will be
increased, making the cat easier to raise, but the height to which the cat can be raised will
be reduced.
14. (A). Because this block-and-tackle arrangement merely changes the direction of the pull,
it has a mechanical advantage of only 2.
15. (C). The larger cog (Cog A) covers a greater linear distance in a given period of time.
16. (B). The key will feel coldest because metal is a better conductor than the other materials.
17. (D). Opening Valves 1 and 2 allows water to enter the tank. Opening Valves 3 and 5 prevents
water from filling the tank entirely. Opening Valve 4 allows water to leave the tank.
18. (A). Gears with their teeth together in mesh turn in opposite directions. Gear A turns Gear B
in the opposite direction (right), and Gear B turns Gear C in the opposite direction (left).
227
Chapter 17: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

19. (A). Gears with their teeth together in mesh turn in opposite directions. Gear 1 turns clock-
wise. Gear 2, in mesh with Gear 1, turns counterclockwise. Gear 3, in mesh with Gear 2,
turns clockwise. Gear 4, in mesh with Gear 3, turns counterclockwise. Gear 5, in mesh with
Gear 2, turns clockwise.
20. (C). The gauge shows a reading of 21.
21. (D). The formula for determining power is Power = Work ÷ Time.
22. (C). Silver is the best conductor, so it becomes hottest.
23. (A). Stationary pulleys give no mechanical advantage, so effort equals the weight of the
crate or 50 pounds.
24. (C). At the height of the arc, the ball has no upward momentum, so it goes the slowest at
that point.
25. (A). The brace on Angle A covers more area of the angle, so it’s more solidly braced.
Part 9: Assembling Objects Answers
There’s not much one can do to study for the Assembling Objects subtest, with the exception
of possibly buying some jigsaw puzzles and practicing fitting the pieces together. The good
news is that at present this subtest is used only by the navy, and even then, just for a few
navy enlisted jobs. If you plan on enlisting in the navy, check the Appendix to see if the jobs
you’re interested in require a score in this subtest. Otherwise, don’t worry about it. For more
information about the Assembling Objects subtest, see Chapter 14. For additional practice
questions see Chapter 15.

Practice Exam 2
H
opefully you used the results from the first practice exam to determine your weak
areas and spent some time hitting the ol’ books and recharging your thinking cap. We
designed the second practice test so you can see how much you’ve improved. This exam is
exactly like the first one from Chapter 16, except (of course) the questions are different.
You don’t have to be an algebra ace to determine whether you’re making progress through
your review efforts. Simply compare the number of wrong answers you got on Practice Exam 1
from Chapter 16 against the number of wrong answers you have on this test. If you put the
work in, you’ll probably find that you made fewer errors on Practice Exam 2. (A little luck never
hurt anything either.)
If you’re still weak on some of the subtests, go back and hit the books (including this one)
again. To get the most out of this practice exam, take it like you’d take the real ASVAB under
the same conditions:
1. Allow yourself about three hours to take the entire exam, and take the whole thing
at one time.
2. Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted.
3. Bring a timer that you can set for various lengths of time, some scratch paper, and a
pencil.
4. At the start of each subtest, set your timer for the specified period of time.
Don’t go on to the next section until the timer has gone off, and don’t go back to a
previous section. If you finish early, check your work for that section only.
5. Use the answer sheet that’s provided.
6. Don’t take a break during any subtest.
You can take a short one- or two-minute break between subtests if you need it.
After you complete the entire sample test, check your answers against the answer key in
Chapter 19. Remember that the test is scored by comparing your raw score to the scores of
other people, which produces a scaled score. So just because you missed a total of 20 ques-
tions doesn’t mean that your score is 80 (that would be too simple). Turn to Chapter 2 to find
out how the ASVAB is scored.

Military customs and courtesies are proven
traditions that explain what should and
shouldn’t be done in many situations. They
are acts of respect and courtesy when deal-
ing with other people and have evolved as a
result of the need for order, as well as the
mutual respect and sense of fraternity that
exists among military personnel. Military
customs and courtesies go beyond basic
politeness; they play an extremely impor-
tant role in building morale, esprit de corps,
discipline, and mission effectiveness.
Customs and courtesies ensure proper
respect for the chain of command and build
the foundation for self-discipline.
According to this passage:
(A) Military customs and courtesies are
enforced by regulation.

After a series of well-publicized failures by
various inventors, Orville and Wilbur Wright
succeeded in flying and controlling a heav-
ier-than-air craft on December 17, 1903. The
War Department, stung by its investment in
a failed effort by Samuel Langley and com-
pounded by the Wright’s own secretiveness,
initially rejected the brothers’ overtures
toward the government to buy the aircraft.
Prevailing sentiments held that the immedi-
ate future still belonged to the balloon. In
August 1908, the two brothers delivered the
first Army aircraft to the U.S. Government.
That the U.S. government managed to pur-
chase an airplane was a minor miracle. For
more than four years after the Wright broth-
ers’ successful flight at Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina, the government refused to accept
the fact that man had flown in a heavier-
than-air machine.
Which of the following statements is not
supported by the above passage?
(A) The U.S. Government felt that balloons
were more practical than airplanes.
(B) The Wright Brother’s own secretive-
ness contributed to their problems in
getting the government interested in
their aircraft.
(C) The historic flight took place on the
East Coast.
(D) It took more than six years for the
Wright Brothers to interest the U.S.
Government in their airplane.

According to this passage, it can be
assumed that:
(A) Ex-post-facto laws are a problem in the
United States.
(B) Laws applied retroactively are fair.
(C) A person could be prosecuted for an
act that was not a crime when he or
she did it.

Good leaders get involved in their subordi-
nates’ careers. People merely obey arbitrary
commands and orders, but they respond
quickly and usually give extra effort for lead-
ers who genuinely care for them. An often
neglected leadership principle in today’s
environment of technology and specializa-
tion is knowing the workers and showing
sincere interest in their problems, career
development, and welfare. Leadership is
reflected in the degree of efficiency, produc-
tivity, morale, and motivation demonstrated
by subordinates. Leadership involvement is
the key ingredient to maximizing worker
performance.
A key leadership principle that’s often
ignored is:
(A) leading by example
(B) showing sincere interest in the prob-
lems of the workers
(C) ensuring workers have access to the
most modern technology

Any discussion of distinctive military capabilities
would be incomplete without looking at their rela-
tionship to the Joint Service vision of the future.
JV 2020 guides all the Services into the next cen-

sets forth four overarching operational concepts:
dominant maneuver, precision engagement,
focused logistics, and full-dimensional protection.
Each of these operational concepts reinforces the
others. The aggregate of these four concepts,
along with their interaction with information
superiority and innovation, allows joint forces to
dominate the full range of military operations
from humanitarian assistance through peace
operations to the highest intensity conflict.

Genetics is a branch of science dealing with
heredity. The field is concerned with how genes
operate and the way genes are transmitted to off-
spring. Subdivisions in the field include cytogenet-
ics, which is the study of the cellular basis of
inheritance; microbial genetics, the study of inher-
itance in microbes; molecular genetics, the study
of the biochemical foundation of inheritance; and
human genetics, the study of how people inherit
traits that are medically and socially important.
Genetic counselors are primarily concerned with
human genetics. They advise couples and families
on the chances of their offspring having specific
genetic defects.

ead over each question from Chapter 18 as you check the answer key. Doing so
reminds you what the question is about and serves as a helpful review. If you look at
each question and the possible answers, you can also identify some of the traps that you
may run across on the ASVAB. By the time you’ve taken and scored Practice Exam 2, you
should have a good idea of your strengths and weaknesses. Compare your scores from
Practice Exam 2 to the scores you got on Practice Exam 1 to see if you’re making progress.
If some subjects or subtests still give you problems, keep studying.
Part 1: General Science Answers
The answers to the questions on the General Science subtest are fairly straightforward —
you either know the answer or you don’t. This can be a hard subject to study for because
General Science includes the entire scope of scientific disciplines. The good news is you may
not even have to score well on this subtest — it depends on the job you’re interested in. See
the Appendix for military jobs that require a good General Science score.

This subtest is one of the most important because it makes up a portion of your AFQT score,
the score that determines your overall mental qualifications to enlist in the military.
Hopefully you missed fewer questions this time around, than you did when you took the
first practice exam.

If you think you need more in-depth study, consider Algebra For Dummies and Algebra II For
Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For
Dummies by Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math for Dummies by Scott Hatch — all published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc. You may also wish to review Chapters 7 and 8, or see if you can find
some high-school-level math textbooks at your local library. Chapter 9 has some additional
practice questions.
1. (B). Simply add the cost of all the books: $18.00 + $14.50 + $9.95 = $42.45.
2. (D). The probability of rolling a 5 is 1 out of 6 (1⁄6), so the probability of NOT rolling a 5 is 
1 – 1⁄6, or 5⁄6. The probability of not rolling a 5 twice is 5⁄6 × 5⁄6, or 25⁄36.
3. (A). 2 tons = 4,000 pounds. 4,000 × $0.12 = $480.00.
4. (C). y = (a + b)2. Expanding the equation results in y = a2 + b2 + 2ab. You know that a2 + b2 = 30,
and ab = 10. When you substitute these known values into the equation, you get y = 30 + 2(10).
Solving for y, results in y = 50.
5. C. 8 pints make up a gallon, so a gallon contains 16 half-pints. One half-pint equals 1⁄16 of a
gallon.
6. (D). First subtract the old cost from the new cost: $2.80 – $2.50 = $0.30. Then divide the
difference by the old cost to find the percent difference: $0.30 ÷ $2.50 = 0.12 = 12%.
7. (C). The aircraft travels 120 miles in 12 minutes, which is 1⁄5 of an hour. Therefore, in 5⁄5 (one)
hour, it would travel 5 × 120, or 600 miles. The aircraft is traveling 600 miles per hour.
8. (D). Multiply 50 bushels by 8% to find the yield increase in bushels: 50 × 0.08 = 4. Add 4
bushels (the amount of the increase) to 50 bushels (the original yield) to determine that an
8% increase equals 54 bushels.
9. (B). Convert the change to dollars or fractions of dollars and add:
14 dollars
= $14.00
16 half dollars
= $8.00
12 quarters
= $3.00
8 dimes
= $0.80
25 nickels
= $1.25
10 pennies
= $0.10
= $27.15
Subtract the total from $30.00 to determine how much money Junior has to borrow: 
$30.00 – $27.15 = $2.85.
10. (B). Her commission for the week was $40 (0.05 × 800 = 40). The ratio of her commission to
her salary is 40⁄80, which can be reduced to 1⁄2.
11. (C). A gallon consists of 4 quarts. 4 × 25 = 100.
12. (D). Dividing 4 crewmembers by 2 crewmembers shows that 4 members are twice as many
as 2 members. Multiply the number of days it would take 4 people to paint by 2 (3 × 2) to
determine how long it would take 2 people to do the same task.
13. (A). Brian’s hourly wage is 24⁄5 ($4.80). Christina’s hourly wage is 10.95/3($3.65). 
$4.80 – $3.65 = $1.15.
14. (C). The amount of time from 8:30 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. is 2 hours and 45 minutes, or 245⁄60. To
reduce the fraction, divide 45 by 60 to get 0.75, or 3⁄4. The total amount of time Margaret has
to get ready is 23⁄4 hours.

15. (C). At a rate of 7 documents per minute, the employee can shred 630 documents in 90 min-
utes. How do you come up with that number? Multiply 7 by 90 (the number of minutes in 
11⁄2 hours). Subtract 630 from 900 total documents to determine that after 11⁄2 hours of
shredding, 270 documents remain.
16. (A). The stereo depreciates $240 the first year (0.2 × 1200 – 240). Therefore, the value of the
stereo after the first year is $1200 – $240 = $960. The second year the stereo would depreci-
ate by $192 (0.2 × 960). The value of the stereo after the second year is $960 – $192 = $768.
17. (A). Divide the distance (135 miles) by the speed (45 miles per hour) to determine that
Janet will take 3 hours to reach the city.
18. (D). Multiply the price of the blouse by the amount of the discount: $18.50 × 0.20 = $3.70.
19. (C). Subtract the original salary from the new salary to get the difference in salary: 
$360 – $320 = $40. Then divide the difference in salary ($40) by the original salary ($320)
to determine the percent increase: 40 ÷ 320 = 0.125 = 12.5%.
20. (B). A circle is 360 degrees, so 40 degrees is 1⁄9 of a circle (360 ÷ 40 = 9). To get the answer of
40 feet, multiply the perimeter of the track 1⁄9 (360 × 1⁄9 = 40).
21. (B). Subtract $35.98 from $40.00 to get $4.02.
22. (B). Subtract the speed of the plane from the speed of the balloon to determine how much

23. (A). Divide the total cost by the number of boxes purchased to determine the cost per box:
$48 ÷ 12 = $4.
24. (D). Multiply 20 × 0.05 to determine how many more miles per gallon the car will get. The
answer is 1. Then add the number of additional miles per gallon the car will get to the origi-
nal number of miles per gallon the car gets to reach the new average: 1 + 20 = 21.
25. (A). The minimum length of spike is equal to the diameter of the tree. To find the
diameter of the tree, use the formula, C = ÷ d, where C = 43.96, and ÷ = 3.14. 43.96 = 3.14 × d.
d = 43.96 ÷ 3.14. d = 14.
26. (D). Divide 101⁄2 by 3⁄4. You can perform this operation by multiplying 10 1⁄2 by the inverse of 3⁄4:
101⁄2 × 4⁄3 = 21⁄2 × 4⁄3 = 84⁄6. This fraction, reduced, becomes 14.
27. (B). First multiply length × width to determine the area of the patio: 12 feet × 14 feet = 168
square feet. Next determine the area in square inches that needs to be covered: 168 square
feet × 12 inches = 2,016 square inches. Finally, divide that answer by the size of the stones to
determine the number of stones needed: 2,016 ÷ 8 = 252.
28. (D). Calculate the amount of the deduction by multiplying her salary by the percent
deducted: $25,000 × 28% = $25,000 × 0.28 = $7,000. Subtract that product from the salary
to determine the net pay: $25,000 – $7,000 = $18,000.
29. (B). When the sum of two angles is 180 degrees, the angles are said to be supplemental to
each other. To find the supplement, subtract 55 from 180 (180 – 55 = 125).
30. (C). Multiply the height of the stack in feet by 12 to determine the height of the stack in
inches: 6 × 12 = 72 inches. Divide that number by 4 inches, the thickness of each board to
determine the number of pieces of lumber in the stack: 72 ÷ 4 = 18.

Part 3: Word Knowledge Answers
If your score on the Word Knowledge subtest has improved since you took the first test, con-
gratulations! If not, don’t be too surprised. Improving your score on this subtest in a short
period of time can be difficult. But it can be done. Review the information from Chapter 4
and set aside time each day (maybe several times a day, depending on how soon you plan on
taking the ASVAB) to memorize words, roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Your score on the Word
Knowledge subtest is important — it counts toward your AFQT score (see Chapter 1).
Vocabulary For Dummies by Laurie E. Rozakis (Wiley) and SAT Vocabulary For Dummies
by Suzee Vlk (Wiley) may also help improve your vocabulary and increasing your score on
this subtest. Chapter 6 has some additional practice questions for you to sink your dictionar-
ies into.

Part 4: Paragraph Comprehension Answers
Doing well on this subtest is really important if you want to enlist in the military — your
Paragraph Comprehension score counts toward your AFQT score. If you’re still missing more
answers than you should, concentrate on improving your analytical-reading skills as you pre-
pare to take the third practice exam. (Review the information in Chapter 5, too.) For example,
when you’re reading the evening newspaper, ask yourself what the main point of an article is.
Or, when you finish a news story, set the paper down and try to remember what the President
said about the budget deficit. Think of this technique as a workout for your mind. You can find
more practice questions in Chapter 6.
1. (C). Nothing escapes from a black hole, including light, so Choice (A) is incorrect. A black
hole occurs when a supernova collapses, but they’re not the same thing, so Choice (B) is
incorrect. The passage states that the universe might end as a black hole, not that a black
hole created the universe, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
2. (C). The passage makes no reference about the enforceability of customs and courtesies,
so Choice (A) would be incorrect. According to the passage, military customs and courtesies
go beyond basic politeness, making Choice (B) incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because the
passage doesn’t reference any individual military service. The last sentence of the passage
contains the correct answer.
3. (B). The passage states that Panama revolted against Columbia, not that they fought over
the canal, so Choice (A) is incorrect. The passage states that the foreign companies were
unsuccessful in building the canal, so Choice (C) is incorrect. The United States, not
Panama, built the canal, so Choice (D) is wrong.
264
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

4. (D). According to the passage a torn U.S. Flag can be professionally mended, but a severely
torn flag should be destroyed. The preferred method of destruction is by burning.
5. (D). The passage states that guilds had economic and social purposes, so Choice (A) is incor-
rect. The passage states that guilds were similar to labor unions, so Choice (B) is incorrect.
The passage states that guilds protected merchants and craftspeople; it says nothing about
exploiting workers, so Choice (C) is incorrect.
6. (D). According to the passage it took over four years for the Government to believe that
anyone had flown a heavier-than-air craft. The historic flight was in December 1903, and the
Wright Brothers delivered the first aircraft to the government in August 1908, 41⁄2 years later.
All of the other statements are supported by the passage.
7. (C). Because the U.S. Constitution prohibits these kinds of laws, Choice (A) is incorrect. The
passage doesn’t support Choice (B). The passage states that the British Commonwealth
allows ex-post-facto laws, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (A). The passage describes how troy and common weights are different, so Choice (B) is
incorrect. Common and avoirdupois are the same system, so Choice (C) is incorrect. A troy
ounce is larger than a common ounce, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
9. (B). The passage doesn’t address leading by example or use of technology by workers, so
Choices (A) and (C) would be incorrect. Maximizing worker performance is a result of lead-
ership involvement, not a principle of leadership, making Choice (D) incorrect. The correct
answer is found in the third sentence of the passage.
10. (C). The passage doesn’t support Choices (A) or (B). The passage states that white blood
cells are found in blood and bone marrow, so Choice (D) is wrong.
11. (C). High intensity conflict is listed as a type of military operation, not one of the four opera-
tional concepts.
12. (C). The JV 2020 guides all of the military services with its vision of future war fighting. While
Choice (D) would be close, the passage doesn’t specifically reference military training.
13. (B). Cytogenetics is the study of the cellular basis of inheritance; the text doesn’t support
Choices (A), (C), or (D).
14. (A). Nothing in the passage supports Choices (B) or (D). Although human genetics is an
important subfield of genetics, nothing in the passage suggests that it’s the only concern of
geneticists. Microbial genetics, as mentioned in the passage, is a subfield in genetics that
has nothing to do with humans, so Choice (C) is incorrect.
15. (C). Nothing in the passage supports Choices (A), (B), or (D).
Part 5: Mathematics Knowledge Answers
While the Military doesn’t expect you to be the next Einstein, a solid grasp of mathematics is
important because math skills make up one-half of your AFQT score. If you’re still struggling
on this subtest, it’s time to hit the books. (Actually, as much as you may feel like it, we don’t
recommend that you actually hit the books — just study them.)
Some excellent books on the subject include Algebra For Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies
by Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For Dummies by
Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math For Dummies by Scott Hatch (all books published by Wiley). See
Chapter 9 for some more fun practice questions.
1. (A). If two exponents have the same base, you can multiply them by keeping the base and
adding the exponents together.
265
Chapter 19: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

2. (A). To find area, multiply length times width (A = lw). To determine the length, subtract two
times the width from the perimeter: 36 – 2(4) = 36 – 8 = 28. Then divide the remainder by 2
to determine the length of one side: 28 ÷ 2 = 14. Then multiply length times width to deter-
mine the area: 14 × 4 = 56.
3. (D). The cube of 4 = 4 × 4 × 4 = 64, so 4 is the cube root of 64.
4. (A). To convert this number to scientific notation, move the decimal point to the left until
it’s to the immediate right of the first number, while counting the number of moves. In this
case, you move it 5 places. The result is then multiplied by 10, raised to the power of the
number of places the decimal point was moved.
5. (C). A reciprocal is the number by which a number can be multiplied to produce 1. So the
reciprocal of 1⁄6 is 6 because 1⁄6 × 6 = 1.
6. (A). Multiply both sides of the equation by 0.05 to isolate x: 0.05 ÷ x × 0.05 = 1 × 0.05 or 
x = 0.05. Check by substituting 0.05 for x in the original equation.
7. (C). x2 – 6x + 9 = (x – 3)(x –3) = (x – 3)2
8. (C). Solve the left side of the equation first. (6) (5) (8) = 240. Therefore, 240 = (6 × 4)x, which
equals 240 = 24x. Now isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 24: 240 ÷ 24 = 
24x ÷ 24 or 10 = x. Check your answer by substituting 10 for x in the original equation.
9. (B). Isolate x on one side of the equation:
2x – 6 = x + 5
2x – 6 – x = x + 5 – x
x – 6 = 5
x – 6 + 6 = 5 + 6
x = 11
Check by substituting 11 for x in the original equation.
10. (D). Solve for I. I = (1,000) (7%) (1) or I = (1,000) (0.07) (1) = 70.
11. (B). (x – 7)2 – 4 = (x + 1)2
(x – 7)(x – 7) – 4 = (x + 1)(x + 1)
x2 – 7x – 7x + 49 – 4 = x2 + x + x + 1
x2 – 14x + 45 = x2 + 2x +1
–14x + 45 = 2x + 1
–14x + 45 = 1
–16 x = –44
x = –44/–16
x = 11/4
x = 23⁄4
12. (A). The area of a circle is A = πr2. A = π52. π is approximately 3.14, so 3.14 × 25 means A is
approximately 78.5 inches.
13. (C). 2⁄3(6x – 9) + 4 > 5x + 1
4x – 6 + 4 > 5x + 1
4x – 2 > 5x + 1
4x > 5x + 3
–x > 3
x < –3
266
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

14. (B). For cylinders, Volume = πr2(h). In this problem, V = π(32)(5). Assume π is approximately
3.14. V is approximately equal to (3.14)(9)(5) or 141 cubic inches.
15. (A). A right triangle has one right angle (one 90-degree angle).
16. (D). Parallelograms have opposite sides of equal length.
17. (D). Angles measuring more than 90 degrees are obtuse angles.
18. (B). This is a quadratic equation, which is solved by factoring.
–x2 – x + 30 = 0
–(–x2 – x + 30) = 0
x2 + x – 30 = 0
(x +6)(x – 5) = 0
x + 6 = 0
x – 5 = 0
x = –6
x = 5
19. (B). Volume equals length times width times height (V = lwh). In this case, V = 64, so one
side of the box is 4-inches long. The cube root of 64 produces this number: 64 = 4 × 4 × 4.
Find the perimeter by adding the four sides together: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.
20. (C). Volume is calculated by multiplying length times width times height (V = lwh). Because
the edges are equal on a cube, each edge is 4 inches. The cube root of 64 produces this
number: 64 = 4 × 4 × 4. The area of one side of the cube is 4 × 4 = 16, and because a cube
has 6 sides, you multiply 16 × 6 to find the surface area of the cube, 96 inches.
21. (C). (x3)3 is the same as (x3)(x3)(x3). Multiply exponents with the same base by keeping the
base and adding the exponents: (x3)(x3)(x3) = x9.
22. (D). 4! (4 factorial) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.
23. (B). To solve, subtract a3 from both sides of the equation:
a3 + b3 – a3 = a3 + x3 – a3
b3 = x3
b = x
24. (B). The formula to find the sum of a finite arithmetic sequence is S = n/2(a + b), where n is the
number of terms, a is the first term in the sequence, and b is the last term in the sequence. In
this case there are 300 terms (n), and the first term is 1 and the final term is 300.
S = n/2(a + b)
S = 300/2(1 + 300)
S = 150(301)
S = 45,150
x + 3
x2 + 3x
+
3x + 9
x2 + 6x + 9
25. (B). (y2)3 is the same as (y2)(y2)(y2). Multiply exponents with the same base by keeping the
base and adding the exponents: (y2)(y2)(y2) = y6.

Part 6: Electronics Information Answers
If you’re still having difficulty defining the difference between AC and DC, you may want to
spend some additional time studying basic electronic information. On the other hand, you
may not be interested in a military job that requires a decent score on this subtest (see the
Appendix), in which case, don’t bother.
If you do need a solid score in this area for your military dream job, Electronics For Dummies
by Gordon McComb (Wiley) can have you tracing circuits in no time. Reviewing Chapter 13
can also help. You can also wrap your wires around the practice questions in Chapter 15.
1. (A). Larger wires require less electrical pressure to run current.
2. (A). Rotor bars are found only on AC induction motors.
3. (D). The ability of current to contract muscles is called the physiological effect.
4. (A). In a closed circuit, one terminal is always positive, and the other is always negative.
5. (A). Root Mean Square is the peak value of voltage multiplied by 0.707 (sine 45)
6. (B). The symbol is a fuse. Fuses are designed to “blow” (melt) if the current flowing through
it exceeds a specified value.
7. (B). NTSC stands for National Television Standards Committee. The system is also used in
Japan. PAL and SECAM are used in other countries.
8. (A). The symbol is a lamp. A lamp is a transducer that converts electrical energy to light.
9. (C). Conventional circuit breaker handles have four positions: on, off, trip, and reset. When
tripped, the handle moves to the middle position.
10. (D). The smaller the wire, the larger the number.
11. (C). The symbol stands for transformer. Transformers are used to step up (increase) and
step down (decrease) AC voltages.
12. (A). An example of a series circuit would be a string of Christmas lights. If you break the
circuit’s path at any point, electricity will stop flowing and the lights will not work.
13. (B). I (current) = Power (watts)/Effort (volts). In this case, I = 1200/120 = 10 amperes.
14. (D). Potential equals voltage; low potential is anything less than 600 watts.
15. (D). Glass is an insulator. Other insulators are plastics, paper, and rubber.
16. (A). Ground wires are always green.
17. (D). Ohm’s law states that V = IR. V = 10 × 20 = 200.
18. (A). Silver is a better conductor, but it’s prohibitively expensive.
19. (D). Oscillators produce high-frequency AC.
20. (B). When DC is applied to an AC appliance, the amount of resistance is less, so more cur-
rent flows through the wire and heat builds up.
Part 7: Auto & Shop Information Answers
Don’t forget that you need to do well on this subtest to qualify for certain military jobs (see
the Appendix). If you don’t care about those jobs, you don’t need to care about this subtest.
But, if you do care about those jobs, and you’re still missing more than a few questions on
this subtest, it’s time for more extreme measures — like taking your mother’s car apart and
putting it back together (or going back over Chapter 11).

Part 8: Mechanical Comprehension Answers
If you need to do well on the Mechanical Comprehension subtest (as in you’re hoping for a
military career that requires a score for this subtest), but you’re still missing more answers
than you should be, ask yourself whether your math skills need work. (Go back to Chapters 7
and 8 if they do.) Many of the formulas you need to know for this subtest require an under-
standing of arithmetic and basic algebra.
Usually, improving your arithmetic and basic-algebra skills will improve your score on this
subtest. Improving your knowledge of physics will also be beneficial, and Physics For
Dummies by Steve Holzner, Ph.D. (Wiley) can help with this. Also take another gander at
Chapter 12 and the practice questions in Chapter 15.
1. (C). A simple pulley gives no mechanical advantage, although it does make work easier by
spreading out the work needed over several tries. So the mechanical advantage is 1.
2. (D). Moving Basket A to the right counterbalances the loss of cherries from Basket B.
3. (A). Wheel B has to make more revolutions to cover the same ground as Wheel A, so it will
cover the distance more slowly.
4. (C). You can calculate psi as Pressure = Force/Area. So, in this problem, P = 200/10 = 20.
5. (B). If Cat A moves toward the center, Cat B will move toward the ground.
6. (B). The formula to determine mechanical advantage of an incline plane is Length of Ramp ÷
Height of Ramp = Weight of Object ÷ Effort. Plugging in the numbers gives you:
6/3 = 200/E
6E = 600
E = 100
7. (C). Micrometers measure very small but not microscopic objects.
8. (C). Reducing the weight on Side B (by removing the cat) will cause Side A to move toward
the ground.
9. (D). Objects rubbing together produce friction.
10. (A). “Normal” atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi.
11. (D). Gears of unequal size can mesh properly as long as their teeth are of equal size.
269
Chapter 19: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

12. (C). Torsion springs coil or uncoil and produce a twisting action, not a direct pull.
13. (B). To move a heavy object a few feet in height, the incline plane is the most efficient
device (of those listed) to use.
14. (B). Water expands when it freezes, possibly damaging engine components.
15. (A). The load is closer to Cat A, so he’s carrying the greater portion of the weight.
16. (C). All the listed parts remain stationary except the lower block.
17. (A). Apply the leverage formula: Length of Effort Arm divided by Length of Resistance Arm =
Resistance Force divided by Effort Force. Or:
9 ÷ 3 = 21 ÷ E (effort force)
3 = 21 ÷ E
3E = 21 ÷ E × E
3E = 21
3E ÷ 3 = 21 ÷ 3
E = 7
18. (C). The valve will open each time a high point of the cam hits it. The cam has three high
points, so the valve will open three times per revolution.
19. (A). Closing only Valves 3 and 4 keeps the water from leaving the tank.
20. (C). Gears in mesh always turn in opposite directions.
21. (B). If Gear 1 turns at 10 rpm, then Gear 2, which is half the size, turns twice as fast at a rate
of 20 rpm.
22. (A). Opening Valves 1, 2, 4, and 8 allows the fuel to travel through the filters. Opening Valves
1, 2, and 3 doesn’t allow the fuel to travel through the filters. Opening Valves 6, 7, and 9
doesn’t allow the fuel to travel through the filters. Opening Valves 4, 6, and 7 will allow fuel
to travel through the filters but not to Reservoir B.
23. (B). A yellow flame indicates too much fuel or not enough air. More air should be allowed to
enter and mix with the gas. Thus, the fuel-air mixture is too rich.
24. (A). The float measures the water level in the tank. If the tank overflows, the float is probably
defective.
25. (C). The 20-pound cat and the 4-pound board weigh 24 pounds total or, divided by 2, 12
pounds per scale.

Practice Exam 3
T
ake the third practice exam a few days before you’re scheduled to take the real ASVAB.
Use it to refresh your memory of the material or to cram for any of the subtests that you
have to do better on than you’ve been doing.
Don’t forget to use the test-taking strategies and the guessing tips in each of the subtest
chapters. And Chapter 3 provides additional information on how to improve your score just
by using smart test-taking strategies.
This sample test features nine subtests and follows the same format as the actual ASVAB. To
get the most out of this sample test, take it like you’d take the real ASVAB under the same
conditions:
1. Allow yourself about three hours to take the entire exam, and take the whole thing
at one time.
2. Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted.
3. Bring a timer that you can set for various lengths of time, some scratch paper, and a
pencil.
4. At the start of each subtest, set your timer for the specified period of time.
Don’t go on to the next section until the timer has gone off, and don’t go back to a

Because leadership is charged with bringing
new ideas, methods, or solutions into use,
innovation is inextricably connected with
the process of being an effective leader.
Innovation means change, and change
requires leadership. Leaders must be the
chief transformation officers in their organi-
zations and learn everything there is to
know about the change before it even takes
place. Furthermore, they must learn how to
deal with the emotions that result from the
chaos and fear associated with change.
According to the passage:
(A) Leaders should resist making changes
that subordinates are likely to resist.
(B) Innovation and change are distinctly
different processes.
(C) It’s not necessary for the leader to
know everything about a change before
it’s implemented.
(D) Change is often associated with panic

(A) Successful counseling requires devel-
oping a relationship.
(B) Most counselees initially reject advice
given by the counselor.

Many small cities and towns rely on volun-
teer fire departments to put out fires. A pro-
fessional fire department, however, has
more training, more expertise, and more
experience in fighting fires and investigating
their causes. In many cases, it’s worthwhile
for even very small towns to hire profes-
sional firefighters.
According to this passage, it’s reasonable to
assume that:
(A) Volunteer firefighters have less train-
ing, expertise, and experience than pro-
fessional firefighters.
(B) Volunteer firefighters have the skills
and resources to investigate the causes
of fires.

Many criminal-law statutes permit more severe
punishment of a person convicted of a crime if he
or she intended to harm another person. For
example, voluntary manslaughter carries a heav-
ier penalty than involuntary manslaughter in
most states. Planned crimes are also punished
more severely than spur-of-the-moment crimes.
The problem is that juries find it difficult to know
what the intent of a person was at the time he or
she committed a crime. Many defendants will
deny that they intended to harm the other
person and claim that any harm that occurred
was “accidental.” The law asks too much of juries
when it expects them to determine what a person
was thinking. Juries should only be asked to
weigh objective evidence.
8.
The author of this passage would agree
that:
(A) Laws should not punish people based
on intention.
(B) Juries aren’t intelligent enough to
weigh evidence.
(C) More laws should distinguish between
crimes committed with intent and
crimes committed on the spur of the
moment.
(D) Lawyers will lie about anything.
9.
According to this passage:
(A) Most states don’t distinguish
between voluntary and involuntary
manslaughter.
(B) Punishing people more severely 
for voluntary manslaughter is
unconstitutional.
(C) It’s difficult for juries to determine a
defendant’s intentions at the time a
crime was committed.
(D) Prosecutors can, through careful ques-
tioning, show a defendant’s intention at

Ergonomics is the science of designing and
arranging workspaces so that people and objects
interact efficiently and safely. Lack of attention 
to ergonomics causes thousands of workers to
suffer repetitive stress injury, eye fatigue, muscle
soreness, and many other medical problems each
year.
Adequate lighting, well-designed chairs, and 
clutter-free work areas contribute to effective
ergonomic design. The opportunity to take short
breaks every hour or two, especially for desk-
bound workers, is also helpful. It’s also important
for workers to avoid performing the same move-
ments over and over for hours at a time. Variety
in the type of work being done can decrease the
chance of injury.

According to this passage:
(A) Ergonomics can cause injuries.
(B) Ergonomics is about designing and
arranging workspaces efficiently and
safely.
(C) Ergonomics is expensive and time 
consuming.
(D) Few people experience problems due
to poor ergonomics.
11.
According to this passage:
(A) Adequate lighting and well-designed
chairs, although important, have noth-
ing to do with ergonomics.
(B) Repetition in the type of work people
do helps them accomplish their tasks
safely and efficiently.
(C) Short breaks aren’t important for desk-
bound employees because they do
little heavy labor.
(D) Ergonomic design also includes keep-
ing work areas well lit and clutter free.

Chapter 20: Practice Exam 3
Electricity is the most inefficient and costly way
to heat a home. One kilowatt-hour of electricity
creates about 3,400 British thermal units (BTUs).
(BTUs are a standard heat measurement.) The
price of electricity per kilowatt-hour is between
$0.10 and $0.25 or between $29.35 and $73.13 per
million BTUs.
In contrast, fuel oil, which produces 140,000
BTUs per gallon, costs about $8.33 to $13.89 per
million BTUs. Natural gas, which produces
100,000 BTUs per therm, can be purchased for
$5.00 to $22.50 per million BTUs. Oak firewood,
which produces 26,000,000 BTUs per cord, costs
$5.77 to $13.46 per million BTUs.
Choosing the right heating method for your
home, based on the cost of fuel, may be more
expensive at installation but will be cheaper in
the long run.
13.
According to the above passage, a BTU:
(A) is an unusual method of measuring
heat
(B) stands for “British thermal unit”
(C) is the abbreviation for a “big thermal
unit”
(D) can heat a 9 x 12 room
14.
According to the above passage:
(A) Heating with fuel oil is always cheaper
than other methods.
(B) Oak firewood produces fewer BTUs per
dollar than the other types of fuel.
(C) Natural gas costs more than all other
fuels except oak firewood.
(D) Electricity is always the most expen-
sive way to heat a house.
15.
The title of this passage should be:
(A) Choosing the Right Heating Method
(B) Heating Methods for Houses
(C) Know Your BTUs
(D) Price List for Fuel
12.
According to this passage, it’s reasonable to
assume that:
(A) Employers should invest in ergonomic
design to protect workers.
(B) Lack of ergonomic design isn’t 
dangerous.
(C) Labor unions have opposed ergonomic
design.
(D) Poor design is responsible for most
employee accidents.

Chapter 21
Practice Exam 3: 
Answers and Explanations
R
ead over each question from Chapter 20 as you check the answer key. This test is the
last full-length practice exam before you fly out of the nest to take the actual ASVAB.
However, because we’re really nice people, you’ll find a bonus AFQT practice exam in the
next chapter just in case you think you need a little more practice on the four subtests that
make up the “test within the test.”
Part 1: General Science Answers
If you’re still having problems figuring out the difference between an isotope and a planet,
remember you may not have to do well on this subtest. It depends on the military career
you’re interested in. (See the Appendix for a list of military jobs that require a competent
General Science score.) If this subtest is important to your military career aspirations, con-
sider putting in some extra study.
Chemistry For Dummies by John T. Moore, Biology For Dummies by Donna Rae Siegfried,
Astronomy For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephen P. Maran, Weather For Dummies by 
John D. Cox, and Physics For Dummies by Steve Holzner, Ph.D. (all books published by
Wiley) are great references. Additional information can be found in Chapter 10, and
Chapter 15 has a few more practice questions.

Part 2: Arithmetic Reasoning Answers
You have to do well on this subtest in order to qualify for military enlistment — your score
from the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest counts toward your AFQT score. If you’re still doing
poorly on this test, you may want to postpone taking the ASVAB until you have more study
time under your belt (and perhaps take a math class or two).

You have one more opportunity to practice this subtest in the next chapter, but before then
consider some extra study aids, such as Algebra For Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies by
Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For Dummies by Mark
Ryan, and SAT II Math for Dummies by Scott Hatch — all published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
You may also wish to review Chapters 7 and 8 and the practice questions in Chapter 9.
1. (D). Multiply $0.45 (the cost of making 3 donuts) by 4 to find the cost of making a dozen
donuts: $0.45 × 4 = $1.80. Then multiply the cost of making a dozen donuts by 5 to determine
the cost per 5 dozen: $1.80 × 5 = $9.00. Next, multiply the selling price per dozen times 5, the
number of dozens sold: $3.95 × 5 = $19.95. Finally subtract the cost of making 5-dozen donuts
from the price the baker sells them for to determine the profit: $19.95 – $9.00 = $10.95.
2. (C). Let x equal the number of dimes. Then 100 – x represents the number of quarters.
There is $0.10x in dimes and $0.25(100 – x) in quarters.
0.10x + 0.25(100 – x) = 19.75
0.10x + 25 – 0.25x = 19.75
–0.15x = –5.25
x = –5.25/–0.15
x = 35
3. (D). First determine the square footage of the patio: 12 feet × 16 feet = 192 square feet. Then
multiply this number by the cost per square foot to determine what the brick layer charges:
192 × $8 = $1,536.
4. (A). Let x equal Angie’s hourly wage. x + 2 would then represent Tim’s hourly wage, and 
3(x + 2) would represent Terry’s hourly wage.
x + (x +2) + 3(x +2) = 43
x + x + 2 + 3x + 6 = 43
5x + 8 = 43
5x = 35
x = 35⁄5
x = 7
5. (B). Two people is 1⁄2 as many as 4 people: 2 ÷ 4 = 1⁄2. Multiply the number of machines 4
people can run by 1⁄2 to determine how many machines 2 people can run: 8 × 1⁄2 = 4.
6. (B). Let x equal the number of daily tickets you would purchase. 36x = the daily ticket cost.
240 < 36x
240/36 < x
62⁄3 < x
You would need to use the ticket more than 62⁄3 times (or 7 times) in order for it to be
cheaper to use the season ticket.
7. (C). Convert the pipe length to inches: 3 feet, 6 inches = 42 inches. Multiply 42 inches by the
number of pipes needed to find the number of inches of pipe needed: 42 × 4 = 168. Divide
the total amount of pipe needed in inches by 12 to determine how many feet of pipes are
needed: 168 ÷ 12 = 14.
306
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

8. (B). The fastest way to solve this would be to simply multiply the possible choices together
(19 × 21 = 399). You can also solve this with algebra. Let x equal the first number and x + 2
the second number.
x(x + 2) = 399
x2 + 2x = 399 (Note: This is a quadratic equation that can be solved by setting it equal to
zero and factoring.)
x2 + 2x – 399 = 0
(x – 19)(x + 21) = 0
x – 19 = 0
x + 21 = 0
x = 19
x = –21
x + 2 = 21
x + 2 = –19
Two solutions are possible: 19 and 21, and –21 and –19. Because the latter pair isn’t one
of the answer choices, the first pair is the correct answer.
9. (C). Multiply her total sales by her percent commission to find her commission: 
$530.00 × 0.65 = $344.50.
10. (B). The diagonal formula for a rectangle is D2 = L2 + W 2. In this case, D = 5, and L = W + 1.
Substituting the known values into the formula results in 52 = (W + 1)2 + W 2.
25 = (W + 1)(W + 1) + W 2
25 = W 2 + 2W + 1 + W 2
25 = 2W 2 + 2W + 1 (Note: This equation is a quadratic equation and can be solved by
setting it equal to zero and factoring.)
0 = 2W 2 + 2W – 24
1⁄2(0) = 1⁄2(2W 2 + 2W – 24)
0 = W 2 + W – 12
0 = (W – 3)(W + 4)
W – 3 = 0
W + 4 = 0
W = 3
W = –4 (not a possible solution)
11. (B). If 2 inches = 3 miles, then 1 inch equals 11⁄2 miles: 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5. Multiply 11⁄2 miles × 91⁄2 inches
to determine the actual distance: 1.5 × 9.5 = 14.25 or 141⁄4 miles.
12. (A). The area of the entire piece of canvas = 10 inches × 14 inches = 140 square inches. The
portion painted on equals 8 inches × 12 inches = 112 square inches. (This is determined by
subtracting 1 inch from the length of each side to account for the margin.) The portion used
for painting can be expressed as a fraction: 112⁄140. Reduce this fraction (divide 112 by 140) to
determine that 80% of the canvas is covered with paint.
13. (D). Calculate perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides of a quadrilateral: 
9 + 9 + 16 + 16 = 50 feet.
14. (B). The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W. In this case, P = 100 and 
L = 1.5W.
100 = 2(1.5W) + 2W
100 = 3W + 2W
100 = 5W
W = 100⁄5
W = 20. The width of the rectangle is 20 inches. Becuase the length is 11⁄2 the width, 
1.5 × 20 = 30.
307
Chapter 21: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

15. (C). The total number of quizzes is 10. If he passed seven of them, the fraction would be
expressed as 7⁄10.
16. (D). Convert the measurement to inches: 1 yard = 36 inches; 36 inches × 3 = 108 inches.
Divide the total number of inches by the number of dresses being trimmed to determine the
length of each piece of ribbon: 108 inches ÷ 4 = 27 inches. Convert the quotient (27 inches)
to a fraction of a yard: 27⁄36 = 27 ÷ 36 = 75% = 3⁄4 of a yard.
17. (B). Divide $30 by $500 to determine the percentage of $500 that the reward comprised.
18. (A). First find how many bolts a full bin contains: 7 × 12 = 84 bolts. Then multiply the total
number of bolts in a full bin by 1⁄6 to find how many bolts are in the bin when it’s 1⁄6 full: 
84⁄1 × 1⁄6 = 84⁄6 = 14 bolts.
19. (C). The first bike got a 4⁄5 mile head start (12 × 4⁄60). Therefore, by the time the second
bike leaves, there are 51⁄5 miles between them (6 – 4⁄5). Their combined rate of travel is 
12 + 14 = 26 mph. Let t = the number of hours the second bike travels.
26t = 51⁄5
26t = 26⁄5
t = 26⁄5 ÷ 26⁄1
t = 26⁄5 × 1⁄26
t = 1⁄5
1⁄5 of an hour = 20 minutes. The second bike left at 2:09, so both bikes will meet at 2:29.
20. (B). Choice (B) is the cheapest option. Calculate each answer option and compare:
Choice (A): 2 × $0.79 = $1.58.
Choice (B): $1.49.
Choice (C): Two 3-ounce cans don’t equal 8 ounces, so this answer can’t be correct.
Choice (D): 3 × $0.65 = $1.95.
21. (D). Add the sales amounts together: $25.70 + $32.30 + $31.80 = $89.80. Then multiply the
total sales by 3⁄4 to determine how much money he has left: $89.80 × 0.75 = $67.35.
22. (B). Divide $30.00 by $3.95. The whole number is the number of pairs of socks he could buy:
$30.00 ÷ $3.95 = 7.59 or 7 pairs of socks.
23. (D). 16 ounces make a pound. Subtract 43 pounds, 7 ounces (the weight of the puppy)
from 59 pounds, 21 ounces (the weight of the crate). 59 pounds, 21 ounces is the same as
60 pounds, 5 ounces, but converting an additional pound to ounces makes the subtraction
possible.
59 pounds, 21 ounces
– 43 pounds, 7 ounces
16 pounds, 14 ounces
24. (D). The probability that all five computers will be defective is 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 ×
0.15 = 0.0000759 (round up to 0.000076).
25. (B). Find the area of each bedroom and add them together: 12 × 14 = 168; 12 × 10 = 120; 
8 × 12 = 96. 168 + 120 + 96 = 384 square feet. Then, because 3 feet make up a yard, divide the
total area in square feet by 3 to determine the number of square yards needed: 384 ÷ 3 = 128
square yards.
26. (A). Divide the total number of pages to be typed by the number of pages Rafael can type per
hour to find the number of hours it will take him to type the pages: 126 pages ÷ 9 pages per
hour = 14 hours.
308
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

27. (D). Divide the group of 40 girls by the number of girls who can play at the same time: 
40 ÷ 10 = 4. This means 4 groups of girls have to share the 60 minutes or 60 minutes ÷ 4 =
15 minutes. Thus, each girl plays for 15 minutes.
28. (B). Subtract the first day’s late charge from the total: $8.25 – $2.00 = $6.25. Then divide the
remainder by $1.25 to determine the number of additional days the video was overdue:
$6.25 ÷ $1.25 = 5. Add those 5 days to the first day the video was late, to find that the video
was 6 days overdue.
29. (D). Divide the number of calories in the pudding by the number of calories in the broccoli:
150 ÷ 60 = 21⁄2. Janet can eat 21⁄2 times the amount of broccoli as she can eat pudding for
the same number of calories. Multiply 21⁄2 by 1⁄2 cup (the amount of pudding that contains
150 calories) to find how many cups of broccoli she can eat for 150 calories: 2.5 × 0.5 = 1.25
or 11⁄4 cups.
30. (C). The time between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. is 4 hours or 240 minutes. Divide the total number
of minutes in the time period by 15 minutes — the interval that the dog barks. Then add 1
because the dog started barking at the beginning of the period: (240 ÷ 15) + 1 = 17.
Part 3: Word Knowledge Answers
The Word Knowledge subtest is another one of the “big four” that counts toward your AFQT
Score. If you’re not seeing the improvement in your scores that you need to see, work with a
partner who can quiz you on vocabulary. Review your vocabulary words intensely, even sev-
eral times a day, to ensure your success on this subtest.
See Chapter 4 for more help on improving your word knowledge. You may also find Vocabulary
For Dummies by Laurie E. Rozakis (Wiley) and SAT Vocabulary For Dummies by Suzee Vlk
(Wiley) to be useful. While additional practice questions are available in Chapter 6, you also
have one more chance to practice this subtest in the practice AFQT in Chapter 22.

Part 4: Paragraph Comprehension Answers
Because the military bigwigs use the Paragraph Comprehension subtest to determine if you
even qualify for enlistment (it counts toward your AFQT score), you need to do well here. If
you’re still struggling, remember to take your time when you read the passages. And, after
you read each question, you can quickly reread the passage just to make sure you’re on the
money. The information is in the paragraph; you just have to concentrate to pull it out. Turn
309
Chapter 21: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

to Chapter 5 and the practice questions in Chapter 6 if you still need additional help to pull
off a good score on this subtest. An additional opportunity to practice taking this subtest is
in the next chapter.
1. (D). The passage states that leaders must learn to deal with negative emotions connected
with change, making Choice (A) incorrect. The second sentence makes it clear that innova-
tion means change, so Choice (B) is incorrect. The third sentence clearly states that leaders
must learn everything there is to know about the change, making Choice (C) the wrong
choice.
2. (C). The passage states that pumas, mountain lions, and cougars are the same thing, so
Choice (A) is incorrect. Nothing in the passage supports Choice (B). The passage states
that cougars live about 18 years in the wild, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
3. (B). The counseling process works because the counselee feels the need for assistance,
instruction, or understanding. Therefore, Choice (B) isn’t supported by the passage. The
other three choices are all supported by the contents of the paragraph.
4. (A). The passage says that professionals, not volunteers, have the skills needed to investi-
gate fires, so Choice (B) is incorrect. The passage states that professional firefighters have
more experience investigating the causes of fires, so Choice (C) is incorrect. The passage
states that hiring professional firefighters is worthwhile, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
5. (C). The passage doesn’t state the locale of the story, so Choices (A) and (D) are incorrect.
The references to extreme cold and lack of light makes Choice (B) an incorrect answer.
6. (A). The main point of the passage is to define epidemiology. Choices (B), (C), and (D) aren’t
the main points of the passage.
7. (B). The only statement that’s supported by the passage is Choice (B). In fact, this sentence
is the primary theme of the passage. The other choices aren’t supported by information
contained in the paragraph.
8. (A). Choice (B) isn’t supported by the passage. Choice (C) is the opposite of what the
author argues. The text doesn’t support Choice (D).
9. (C). The passage says that most states punish voluntary manslaughter more severely than
involuntary manslaughter, so Choice (A) is incorrect. The argument that punishing people
more severely for voluntary manslaughter is unconstitutional isn’t made in the passage, so
Choice (B) is incorrect. The passage doesn’t support Choice (D).
10. (B). Lack of attention to ergonomics, not ergonomics itself, can cause injury, so Choice (A)
is incorrect. The passage doesn’t support Choice (C). The passage states that many people
suffer injuries when sufficient attention isn’t paid to ergonomics, so Choice (D) is incorrect.
11. (D). The passage states that adequate lighting and well-designed chairs are part of ergonomic
design, so Choice (A) is incorrect. The passage states that repetitious work can cause injury,
so Choice (B) is incorrect. The passage states that desk-bound workers should take breaks,
so Choice (C) is incorrect.
12. (A). The passage makes it clear that lack of ergonomic design is dangerous, so Choice (B)
is incorrect. Nothing in the passage supports Choice (C). Although the passage claims that
lack of ergonomic design causes injury, nothing in the passage supports Choice (D).
13. (B). The passage says that BTUs are the standard measure of heat, so Choice (A) is incor-
rect. BTU stands for British thermal unit, so Choice (C) is incorrect. Nothing in the passage
supports Choice (D).
14. (D). The passage shows that fuel oil can be more expensive than other heating methods, so
Choice (A) is incorrect. Oak firewood is sometimes less expensive than other types of fuel,
so Choice (B) is incorrect. Natural gas can sometimes cost less than firewood, so Choice (C)
is incorrect.
15. (A). The main point of this passage deals with choosing the right fuel based on price; only
Choice (A) summarizes this point. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are less important points.

Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

Part 5: Mathematics Knowledge Answers
The Mathematics Knowledge subtest is used to determine whether you qualify for enlistment,
so you need to do well. If you’re still missing too many questions, you may need to take more
drastic measures like enrolling in a basic-algebra class at a local community college.
You may also want to consider Algebra For Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies by Mary
Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For Dummies by Mark Ryan,
and SAT II Math For Dummies by Scott Hatch (all books published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
If your scores are improving, keep hitting the books and testing yourself up until the day of
the ASVAB. Turn to Chapter 7 and the practice questions in Chapter 9 for more information.
The practice AFQT in Chapter 22 also gives you a chance to gauge your progress.
1. (B). Substitute 6 for y in the equation: 2(6) × 6 = 12 × 6 = 72.
2. (B). Divide both sides of the equation by 0.05 to isolate x: 0.05x ÷ 0.05 = 1 ÷ 0.05, or x = 20.
To check your answer, substitute 20 for x in the original equation.
3. (C). √25x2 = √(5x)2 = 5x
4. (C). 9x3 + 18x2 – x – 2 = 9x2(x + 2) – 1(x + 2) = (9x2 – 1)(x + 2)
5. (B). 5x + 7 = 6(x – 2) – 4(2x – 3)
5x + 7 = 6x – 12 – 8x + 12
5x + 7 = –2x
7x + 7 = 0
7x = –7
7⁄7x = –7⁄7
x = –1
6. (D). If two powers have the same base, they can be multiplied by keeping the base and
adding the exponents together. In this case, x is the same as x1.
7. (B). This is so easy that it may tempt you to think that the correct answer is too obvious.
The square root of (5 + x)2 is simply 5 + x.
8. (B). First solve the left side of the equation: (9)(2)(8) = 144. So x2 = 144. Find the square root
of each side: x = 12.
9. (A). Isolate x by dividing each side of the equation by –5:
–5x ÷ –5 = 25 ÷ –5
x = –5
10. (C). The area of a circle equals π times the radius squared. The radius is 1⁄2 the diameter. 
A = πr2. A = π62 = π36. If π is approximately 3.14, the area of the circle is approximately 
3.14 × 36 or 113 feet.
11. (B). Volume equals length × width × height (V = lwh): 6 × 6 × 6 = 216 cubic inches.
12. (B). The area of a cylinder is A = πr2. In this problem, A = π52 = π(25). Radius is half the diam-
eter.
13. (C). For cylinders, Volume = πr2(h). Since the radius is half the diameter, the problem can
be calculated this way: V = π(62)10. V = π(36)10. If π is approximately 3.14, then 3.14 × 36 ×
10 = 1,130 cubic inches.
14. (D). In an isosceles triangle, Sides A and C are equal, and Angles 1 and 2 are equal.
15. (A). Rectangles have four equal angles, and all angles are right angles.
16. (A). Supplementary angles always equal 180 degrees.

Chapter 21: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

17. (A). 3(2x – 5) – 2(4x + 1) = –5(x + 3) – 2
6x – 15 – 8x – 2 = –5x – 15 – 2
–2x – 17 = –5x – 17
3x – 17 = –17
3x = 0
3⁄3x = 0⁄3
x = 0
18. (A). Volume equals length × width × height (V = lwh). Finding the cube root of 64 shows that
each edge measures 4 inches.
19. (B). (x3)2 is the same as (x3)(x3). To multiply exponents with the same base, keep the base
and add the exponents: (x3)(x3) = x6.
20. (D). To find out how much rain falls in an hour, multiply the amount that falls in one minute
by 60 because 60 minutes make up an hour. In H hours, the amount of rain is 60IH.
21. (D). 6 + 4 (x – y) = 6 + 4x – 4y. Because x = y, 4x = 4y. Therefore, 4x – 4y = 4x – 4x = 0, and 
6 + 0 = 6.
22. (A). 202 = 400, and 302 = 900, so the range of 20 to 30 is correct.
23. (B).
x + 2
x + 2
x2+ 2x
+ 2x + 4
x2+ 4x + 4
24. (A). Replace the unknowns with the numbers given. (6 × –3) – (3 × –7) – (2 × 4) = 
–18 + 21 – 8 = –5.
25. (C).
x + 4
3x + 5
3x2 + 12x
+5x + 20
3x2 + 17x + 20
Part 6: Electronics Information Answers
If you need to do well on the Electronics Information subtest to qualify for a certain military
career (see the Appendix), and you’re still missing questions, review Chapter 13 again and
spend some time memorizing key electronics concepts, including the mathematical formulas
(like Power = Voltage × Amperes) that help you solve all kinds of electronics problems.

Chapter 21: Practice Exam 3: Answers and Explanations

Part 8: Mechanical Comprehension Answers
If you need to do well on the Mechanical Comprehension subtest, don’t forget to apply your
math skills to the concepts. (A little extra physics study, such as Physics For Dummies by
Steve Holzner, Ph.D. [Wiley] wouldn’t hurt, either.) But simply using your common sense can
help you quite a bit, too. For example, you may not know exactly why a metal spoon feels
colder than a wooden spoon when they’re at the same temperature, but at least you know that
it feels colder. And knowing that may help you answer a question correctly. (A metal spoon is a
better conductor of heat — now you also know the reason.) See Chapter 12 and the additional
practice questions in Chapter 15 for more information on Mechanical Comprehension.
1. (B). The teeth of helical gears are slanted.
2. (B). The cat is closer to Pillar B, so Pillar B bears more weight.
3. (B). Wheel B has to make more revolutions than Wheel A to cover the same amount of dis-
tance, so it will go slower.
4. (A). E stands for effort needed. 30 (weight of the cat) × 2 (length of resistance arm) = x × 6
(length of effort arm). Do a little multiplication, and you get 60 = 6x. To isolate x, divide each
side by 6: 60 ÷ 6 = 6x ÷ 6, or 10 = x.
5. (A). A fixed, simple pulley gives no mechanical advantage, so its mechanical-advantage
number is 1.
6. (D). The formula to determine the mechanical advantage of an incline plane is Length of
Ramp ÷ Height of Ramp = Weight of Object ÷ Effort.
8 ÷ 4 = 400 ÷ E
8⁄4 = 400⁄E
8E = 1,600
8E⁄8 = 1,600⁄8
E = 200
7. (B). Scientists agree that 33,000 foot-pounds per minute is one horsepower.
8. (A). Power = Force/Area. P = 130/1 = 130.
9. (D). Static electricity causes materials to “stick” together this way.
10. (A). An aneroid barometer measures atmospheric pressure.
11. (C). Meshed gears always turn in opposite directions.
12. (D). Springs are used for all the listed purposes except to add weight.
13. (B). Specific gravity is a comparison between the weight of a liquid and the weight of water.
The liquid with the higher specific gravity will have a float that rises higher.
14. (D). Universal joints are used to connect shafts that aren’t in the same plane.
15. (D). Try-cocks measure water level. Water seeks a level throughout a system, so in the
schematic, the try-cock correctly indicates the water level.
16. (A). There are 6 different symbols, so 6 different types of machine screws were used.
17. (B). To determine the amount of force exerted by the cats, first multiply the length of the
resistance arm (as it applies to the cat) by the weight of each cat and add the products
together. The 10-pound cat is supported by the entire weight of the resistance arm, so 
5 × 10 = 50. The 5-pound cat is being supported by 3 feet of the resistance arm, so 3 × 5 = 15.
Add ‘em up: 50 + 15 = 65. This number is equal to the length of the resistance arm times
effort (force) or 65 = 5F. To isolate F, divide both sides by 5: 65 ÷ 5 = 5F ÷ 5 or 13 = F.

18. (C). One revolution of the winch will move the weight 24 inches, the circumference of the
winch drum.
19. (A). Valves 1 and 2 need to be open to fill the tank.
20. (B). Gear 1 makes 10 clockwise revolutions per minute. Gear 2, which is half the size, makes
20 counterclockwise revolutions per minute. (The number of revolutions it makes is inversely
proportional to its difference in size.) Gear 2 is half the size of Gear 1, so to determine the
number of revolutions it makes, multiply the number of revolutions Gear 1 makes by the
inverse of 1⁄2: 10 × 2⁄1 (or just 2) = 20. Gear 3 is 2.5 times the size of Gear 2. In other words, it is 5⁄2
the size of Gear 2. To determine the number of revolutions Gear 3 makes, multiply the inverse
of 5⁄2 by the number of revolutions Gear 2 makes: 2⁄5 × 20. This can be stated as 20⁄1 (the number
of revolutions Gear 2 makes per minute) × 2⁄5 (the fraction of revolutions Gear 3 makes) = 40⁄5 or
8 revolutions per minute.
21. (B). The pinion turns 4 times as often as the gear: 4 × 200 = 800.
22. (C). A float indicates the level of liquid in a container.
23. (B). Using a runner (a single, moveable pulley) gives a mechanical advantage of 2.
24. (A). Because 60 seconds comprise a minute, the valve must open 60 times per minute. The
cam will open the valve 10 times per revolution, so 60 ÷ 10 = 6. The cam must make 6 revolu-
tions per minute to raise the valve 60 times per minute.
25. (D). Because Valve 4 is above the bottom of the tank, some water will remain in the tank
below the level of the valve, so the tank will never be completely empty.

Chapter 22
Practice AFQT Exam
I
f you’re wondering what in the world this exam with the strange acronym is doing in a
book on the ASVAB, don’t be confused. The Armed Forces Qualification Test, or AFQT, 
is actually part of the ASVAB — in a way, it’s a test within a test. Your scaled AFQT score
derives from four subtests of the ASVAB, and it determines your overall mental qualification
to join the service branch of your choice. Each of the five branches of military service has
set its own minimum AFQT score in order to qualify for enlistment. The four subtests that
can make or break your chances of joining the military are Arithmetic Reasoning, Word
Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, and Mathematics Knowledge.
Because we like you (and because you were kind enough to buy this book), we’ve included
an extra chance for you to evaluate your communication and math skills before you head
over to MEPS, or your school, or the local National Guard Armory for the real deal.
After you complete the entire sample test, check your answers against the answer key in
Chapter 23. Remember that the test is scored by comparing your raw score to the scores of
other people. This process produces a scaled score. So just because you missed a total of 20
questions doesn’t mean that your score is 80 (that would be too simple). Turn to Chapter 1
to find out how the AFQT score is derived from these four subtests.
Your goal here is to determine where you may still need to spend some more study time. If
you only miss one question on the Word Knowledge subtest but you miss 15 on Arithmetic
Reasoning, you may wish to dedicate some extra study time to further develop your math
skills before you take the actual ASVAB.

On June 22, 1944, President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt signed into law one of the most
significant pieces of legislation ever pro-
duced by the United States government:
The Servicemembers’ Readjustment Act
of 1944, commonly known as the GI Bill of
Rights. By the time the original GI Bill ended
in July 1956, 7.8 million World War II veter-
ans had participated in an education or
training program, and 2.4 million veterans
had home loans backed by the Veterans
Administration (VA).
The G.I. Bill provided:
(A) free housing, training, and education
(B) medical coverage, education, and assis-
tance to veterans
(C) home loan guarantees, training, and
education for many former military
members
(D) a means to exempt veterans from social
security taxes

Presidential appointments are an ongoing
effort. Some of a president’s appointments
require Senate confirmation. These appoint-
ments are for positions throughout the fed-
eral government, for the Cabinet and
subcabinet, for members of regulatory com-
missions, for ambassadorships, for judge-
ships, and for members of numerous
advisory boards.
Which of the following statements isn’t true?
(A) Presidential appointments require
Senate confirmation.
(B) A position on a regulatory commission
is an example of a Presidential
appointment.
(C) Presidential appointments happen
throughout the President’s term in
office.
(D) All of the above statements are true.

A link between advertising and alcohol
consumption is intuitively compelling but
hasn’t been consistently supported by
research. Because alcohol advertising is
pervasive, econometric studies may not be
sensitive to change or assess in a range
where change actually makes a difference.
In dealing with advertising, partial bans
aren’t likely to be effective, and total bans
aren’t practical. Advertising bans in one
medium also are weakened by substitution
of increased advertising in alternative
media and/ or other promotions.
The author of this passage believes:
(A) Advertisement of alcoholic beverages
should be illegal.
(B) Partial bans on alcohol advertising
could be effective in some cases.
(C) Bans on alcohol advertising aren’t
likely to work.
(D) Clear links have been established
between alcohol consumption and
advertising.

The etymology of the word or name,
Alabama, has evoked much discussion
among philological researchers. It was the
name of a noted southern Indian tribe
whose habitat when first known to
Europeans was in what is now central
Alabama. One of the major waterways in the
state was named for this group and from
this river, in turn, the name of the state was
derived. According to some investigations,
the tribal name Alabama must be sought in
the Choctaw tongue, because it isn’t uncom-
mon for tribes to accept a name given them
by a neighboring tribe.
The state of Alabama was named after:
(A) a Choctaw Indian tribe
(B) European settlers
(C) a river
(D) an Indian Chief

Each of the 94 federal judicial districts han-
dles bankruptcy matters, and in almost all
districts, bankruptcy cases are filed in the
bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy cases can’t
be filed in state court. Bankruptcy laws help
people who can no longer pay their credi-
tors get a fresh start by liquidating their
assets to pay their debts or by creating a
repayment plan. Bankruptcy laws also pro-
tect troubled businesses and provide for
orderly distributions to business creditors
through reorganization or liquidation.
Which of the following statements isn’t
supported by the above passage?
(A) Bankruptcy must be filed in a federal
court.
(B) Bankruptcy is designed to help individ-
uals and protect businesses.
(C) Businesses can be reorganized or
liquidated through bankruptcy.
(D) Bankruptcy must be filed in the
bankruptcy court.

The U.S. Department of Justice has prepared a
report about hate crimes in the United States
between 1997 and 1999. In 60% of hate crime inci-
dents, the most serious offense was a violent
crime, most commonly intimidation or simple
assault. The majority of incidents motivated by
race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability
involved a violent offense, while two-thirds of
incidents motivated by religion involved a prop-
erty offense, most commonly vandalism. Younger
offenders were responsible for most hate crimes.
Thirty-one percent of violent offenders, and 46%
of property offenders were under age 18.
7.
Most property offense hate crimes were
motivated by:
(A) religion
(B) race
(C) sexual orientation
(D) abortion

Linewatch operations are conducted near
international boundaries and coastlines in
areas of Border Patrol jurisdiction to prevent
the illegal entry and smuggling of aliens into
the United States and to intercept those who
do enter illegally before they can escape
from border areas. Signcutting is the detec-
tion and the interpretation of any distur-
bances in natural terrain conditions that
indicate the presence or passage of people,
animals, or vehicles.
The operation that’s designed to detect
changes in the natural environment, which
may indicate passage of illegal aliens is
called:
(A) Linewatching
(B) Signcutting
(C) Border Patrol Operations
(D) Terrain Observation

Wales was in ancient times divided into three
parts nearly equal, consideration having
been paid, in this division, more to the value
than to the just quantity or proportion of ter-
ritory. They were Venedotia, now called
North Wales; Demetia, or South Wales, which
in British is called Deheubarth, that is, the
southern part; and Powys, the middle or
eastern district. Roderic the Great, or Rhodri
Mawr, who was king over all Wales, was the
cause of this division. He had three sons,
Mervin, Anarawt, and Cadell, amongst whom
he partitioned the whole principality.
Wales was divided into divisions because:
(A) Natural boundaries, such as rivers and
mountains made the division necessary.
(B) Wales was too large for the King to
oversee personally.
(C) The King of Wales wanted his sons
to rule.
(D) all of the above

Questions 7 and 8 are based on the following
passage.
Questions 11 and 12 are based on the follow-
ing passage.
The fierce and warlike tribe, called the Huns,
who’d driven the Goths to seek new homes,
came from Asia into Southeastern Europe and
took possession of a large territory lying north of
the River Danube. During the first half of the fifth
century, the Huns had a famous king named
Attila. He was only 21 years old when he became
their king. But although he was young, he was
very brave and ambitious, and he wanted to be a
great and powerful king. As soon as his army was
ready, he marched with it into countries, which
belonged to Rome. He defeated the Romans in
several great battles and captured many of their
cities. The Roman Emperor Theodosius had to
ask for terms of peace. Attila agreed that there
should be peace, but soon afterwards he found
out that Theodosius had formed a plot to murder
him. He was so enraged at this that he again
began war. He plundered and burned cities wher-
ever he went, and at last the emperor had to give
him a large sum of money and a portion of the
country south of the Danube.

would be:
(A) The Burning of Rome
(B) Emperor Theodosius
(C) Attila the Hun
(D) Rome for Dummies
12.
After terms of peace were offered, Attila
resumed the war against Rome because:
(A) He discovered the Emperor wanted to
assassinate him.
(B) He wanted to further expand his
kingdom.
(C) The Emperor of Rome offered too little
money in the peace terms.
(D) Danube, his second-in-charge, advised

theme of the above passage would be:
(A) proficiency
(B) equality
(C) evaluations
(D) relationships

Professional competence is:
(A) a moral obligation
(B) directly relevant to professional
integrity
(C) essential because military operations
impact human life, national security,
and use of taxpayer funds
(D) all of the above
15.
The author of the above passage would
agree that:
(A) Friendship must often take a back seat
to professional integrity.
(B) Only fellow professionals should evalu-
ate competence.
(C) Professional competence is a direct
result of effective training programs.
(D) all of the above
Questions 13 through 15 are based on the fol-
lowing passage.
In the military, as in all professions, the issue of
competence is directly relevant to professional
integrity. Because human life, national security,
and expenditures from the national treasury are
so frequently at issue when the military acts,
the obligation to be competent isn’t merely
prudential. That obligation is a moral one, and
culpable incompetence here is clearly a violation
of professional integrity. Part of the social aspect
of professional integrity involves the joint
responsibility for conduct and competence
shared by all members of the profession. Only
fellow professionals are capable of evaluating
competence in some instances; hence, fellow
professionals must accept the responsibility of
upholding the standards of the profession. Fellow
military members can spot derelictions of duty,
failures of leadership, failures of competence, and
the venalities of conduct that interfere with the
goals of the military mission. Often, the obliga-
tions of professional integrity may be pitted
against personal loyalties or friendships; and,
where the stakes for society are so high, profes-
sional integrity should win out.

Practice AFQT Exam: 
Answers and Explanations
U
se this answer key to score the Practice AFQT Exam in Chapter 22. Hopefully, by now
you are ready to take on the actual ASVAB. (Don’t you just love it when a plan comes
together?) Keep in mind, however, that these four subtests determine whether you can even
get into the military. You should be confident in your math and communicative abilities
before taking the actual exam. If you find you’re still struggling in any of these subtest areas,
you may wish to concentrate some additional study effort before knocking on the
recruiter’s door to say, “I’m ready!”
Part 1: Arithmetic Reasoning Answers
Mathematical word problems can be tough for some people. You have to develop a skill for
determining what factors are relevant to the problem and then be able to convert those fac-
tors into a mathematical formula to arrive at a correct solution. Yikes! No wonder there are
so many math books on the market! A few good ones that may help are Algebra For Dummies
and Algebra II For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For Dummies by Wendy Arnone,
Calculus For Dummies by Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math For Dummies by Scott Hatch — all
published by Wiley. Reviewing Chapters 7 and 8 and the additional practice questions in
Chapter 9 may also help.
1. (A). There are 30 days in April, 31 days in May, and 30 days in June for a total of 91 days.
91 × 35 = 3185.
2. (B). Multiply the number of words you can type per minute (45) by the number of minutes
you will be typing (12). 45 × 12 = 540.
3. (C). Visualize a triangle, where the string represents the hypotenuse and the line between
Tom and Kathy represents one of the legs. The Pythagorean theorem states that if one
knows the length of two sides of a triangle, the length of the third side can be determined,
using the formula a2 + b2 = c2. In this case, 3002 + b2 = 5002.
90,000 + b2 = 250,000
b2 = 250,000 – 90,000
b2 = 160,000
b = √160,000
b = 400

4. (A). The formula used to determine the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L + W). The width is
30, and the parameter is 400. 400 = 2(L + 30).
400 = 2L + 60
340 = 2L
L = 170
5. (C). There are 2 possibilities for the first digit (A or B), 10 possibilities for the second
digit (0 to 9) and 26 possibilities for the third digit. Using the multiplication principle, 
2 × 10 × 26 = 520.
6. (D). The distance formula is distance equals rate times time, or d = rt. Substituting the known
values results in 93,000,000 = 186,000t. So, t = 500 seconds. Divide 500 by 60 to convert to
minutes (81⁄2 minutes).
7. (C). The difference in the price is $3. $3 ÷ $50 = 0.06 or 6%.
8. (B). Let x = the unknown number. Set up the formula as (11 + 41) ÷ x = 13.
52 ÷ x = 13
52 = 13x
x = 4
9. (B). To calculate the new wage, start off by taking $9.25 × 0.04 = $0.37. Then add that
number (the amount of Mark’s raise) to his original hourly wage. Mark’s new hourly wage
is $9.25 + $0.37 = $9.62.
10. (A). Let x = number of nails costing $7 per pound. The total cost of the mixture equals the
sum of the cost for each type of nail or M = A + B, where A = 7x, B = 3(6), and M = 4(6 + x).
Substitute the known values into the equation. 4(6 + x) = 7x + 18.
24 + 4x = 7x + 18
24 – 18 = 7x – 4x
3x = 6
x = 2
11. (D). Convert the different denominators to a common denominator that all the denomina-
tors can divide into evenly. 4, 3, and 6 all divide evenly into 12. To convert 1⁄4 to x⁄12, divide 12
(the new common denominator) by 4 (the old common denominator) to get 3. Then multi-
ply 1⁄4 by 3⁄3 (another way of saying 1). The product is 3⁄12. (1⁄4 = 3⁄12).
Do the same calculation for the other fractions: 1⁄3 = 4⁄12 and 1⁄6 = 2⁄12. Then add the new numera-
tors together: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9. This gives you your new added numerator. Place the added
numerator over the new denominator, and you can see that 9⁄12 of the cards have been sold
or lost. 9⁄12 can be reduced to 3⁄4. 3⁄4 or 75% of the cards have been sold or lost. 20 × 0.75 = 15.
15 of 20 cards have been sold or lost. 20 – 15 = 5 cards remaining.
12. (A). Subtract the sale price from the regular price: $24.00 – $22.50 = $1.50. Multiply the
remainder by the number of CDs to get your answer: $1.50 × 5 = $7.50.
13. (B). First convert the 300 minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (300 ÷ 60 = 5 hours). Use the
distance formula (d = rt) and substitute the known values. 300 = 5r. r = 40.
14. (C). Let x = the number of people in the class. 60% of x = 21, so 0.60x = 21. x = 35.
15. (C). Use the interest formula (I = Prt) to determine the amount of interest earned, where
the principle (P) is 4,000, the rate (r) is .03 (3%) and the time (t) is 10. I = 4,000(.03)(10), or 
I = $1,200. Add the interest earned to the original amount invested. $4,000 + $1,200 = $5,200.
336
Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

16. (B). A rectangle’s perimeter is determined by the formula P = 2(l + w). The length of this rec-
tangle is 3 + 2w. Substituting the known values into the formula results in 36 = 2(w + 3 + 2w).
36 = 2(3w + 3)
18 = 3w + 3
15 = 3w
w = 5
As the length is 3 + 2w, then l = 3 + 2(5), or l = 13.
17. (D). The area of a rectangle is the length × the width of the rectangle. 50 × 100 = 5,000.
18. (B). A kilometer is 5⁄8 of a mile, so multiply 75 × 5⁄8, or 75⁄1 × 5⁄8 = 375⁄8. Divide 8 into 375 to reduce
the fraction and determine that Eric was traveling at 47 miles per hour, 7 mph over the 40
mph posted limit.
19. (B). Let x = the number of grapes. 3 apples and 6 pears equals 1⁄2 of x or 1⁄2(x) = 9. x = 2(9) or 
x = 18.
20. (B). If Janet must purchase 2 pounds of apples to get 1 free pound, to get 2 free pounds, she
would need to purchase twice as many apples or 4 pounds of apples.
21. (A). Divide the total length, 44 feet, by the total number of pipes, 4, because all the pipes are
equal in length. The quotient, 11, is the length of each individual pipe. You can check this
answer by multiplying: 4 × 11 = 44.
22. (A). Subtract the Malamute’s distance from the German Shepherd’s distance (120 – 75) to
determine how much closer the Malamute is to the hydrant.
23. (C). Simply add 14 hours to 6 a.m. to reach 8 p.m.
24. (B). Multiply three pints of strawberries at $1.98 (3 × $1.98 = $5.94); 5 pints of raspberries at
$2.49 (5 × $2.49 = $12.45) and 1 bushel of peaches at $5.50 (1 × $5.50 = $5.50). Add the products
together to determine the amount of cash the farmer earned: $5.94 + $12.45 + $5.50 = $23.89.
25. (D). Divide 532 by 4 to determine how many feet of shelving will be needed.
26. (B). Simply add the cost of all the books: $18.00 + $14.50 + $9.95 = $42.45.
27. (A). 8 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes.
28. (B). If 6 people can run 3 machines, then 18 people can run 3 times the number of machines
6 people can run because 18 = 3 × 6 (divide 18 by 6). 3 × 3 machines = 9 machines. 18 people
can run 9 machines.
29. (A). Multiply the scale measurement for 1 mile (1⁄2 inch per mile) by 5 miles: 1⁄2 × 5 or 1⁄2 × 5⁄1 = 5⁄2.
Reduce this fraction, and you get 2.5 inches.
30. (A). Simply add the cost of all the items: $23.00 + $14.95 + $7.98 + $7.98 = $53.91.

10. (C). The rationale for the division is explained in the final sentence. The passage makes no
reference to the size of Wales or the natural boundaries.
11. (C). The primary theme of this paragraph is about Attila, who was King of the Huns.
12. (A). Attila agreed to peace but soon after discovered that the Roman Emperor had launched
a plot to kill him.
13. (A). The primary theme of the passage is stated in the first sentence. Proficiency is closest in
meaning to the word competence, which is the primary theme of the passage.

Part V: Practice ASVAB Exams 

14. (D). All of the statements are directly supported by the passage.
15. (A). The author specifically states that when pitted against friendship, professional integrity
must often win out. The author explains that only fellow professionals can evaluate other
professionals in some (not all) cases, making Choice (B) incorrect. Choice (C) isn’t sup-
ported by information in the passage.
Part 4: Mathematics Knowledge Answers
It’s too bad the ASVAB folks don’t allow the use of calculators! That would make this subtest
a breeze. Don’t be discouraged. The problems are purposely designed so that they can be
solved using only a scratch paper, the ol’ number two pencil, and a little brain sweat. If
you’re still having difficulty, give Chapter 7 another gander.
Algebra For Dummies and Algebra II For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling, Geometry For
Dummies by Wendy Arnone, Calculus For Dummies by Mark Ryan, and SAT II Math For
Dummies by Scott Hatch (all books published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.) can also help you
improve your math knowledge score. There are additional practice questions in Chapter 9.
1. (C). 5x – 2x = 7x + 2x – 24. 3x = 9x – 24. –6x = –24. 6x = 24. x = 4.
2. (C). The cube of 6 = 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.
3. (A). The x access is intersected at the point where the y-coordinate is 0 (y = 0). Substitute 0
for the y variable in the equation. 3x + 7y = 21 = 3x + 7(0) = 21 = 3x = 21. Therefore, x = 7. The
point’s coordinates are (7, 0).
4. (B). x + y = 6, so y = 6 – x. Substitute this known value for y in the second equation.
x – y = 4
x – (6 – x) = 4
x – 6 + x = 4
2x – 6 = 4
2x = 10
x = 5
5. (D). 4(y + 3) + 7 = 3
4y + 12 + 7 = 3
4y + 19 = 3
4y = –16
y = –4
6. (A). Convert 12 yards and 14 feet to feet: (12 yards × 3 feet per yard) + 14 feet = 36 feet + 14
feet = 50 feet. Divide by 2 as instructed: 50 feet ÷ 2 = 25 feet.
7. (D). If two powers have the same base, the numbers can be multiplied by keeping the base
and adding the powers together.
8. (B). Convert to the lowest common denominator (which is 10), then add. 41⁄2 + 12⁄5 + 33⁄10 = 
42⁄10 + 14⁄10 + 33⁄10 = 89⁄10.
9. (B). 1.5 × 102 = 1.5 × (10 × 10) = 1.5 × 100 = 150.
10. (B). Add the number and then divide by the number of terms. 54 + 61 + 70 + 75 = 260. 
260 ÷ 5 = 52.
339
Chapter 23: Practice AFQT Exam: Answers and Explanations

11. (B). 2 feet + 4 feet = 6 feet, and 4 inches plus 8 inches = 12 inches (the equivalent to 1 foot).
12. (C). Substitute 4 for all x’s in the problem. 44 ÷ 4 = (4 × 4 × 4 × 4) ÷ 4 = 256 ÷ 4 = 64.
13. (B). 5 – 3x ≥14 + 6x
5 – 3x – 6x ≥14
–9x ≥14 – 5
–9x ≥9
x ≤–1
Remember, if you multiply or divide an inequity by a negative number you must reverse the
inequity.
14. (B). (900 × 2) ÷ 6 = 2,700 ÷ 6 = 450.
15. (A). Substitute 2 for all the x’s. xx × xx = 22 × 22 = 4 × 4 = 16
16. (C). This is a quadratic equation that can be solved by factoring and setting each factor
equal to zero.
x2 – 2x – 15 = 0
(x – 5)(x + 3) = 0
x – 5 = 0
x + 3 = 0
x = 5
x = –3
17. (A). The square root of 49 is 7; the square root of 64 is 8. 7 ÷ 8 = 7⁄8.
18. (C). The square root of a squared positive number can either be positive or negative.
19. (C). Solving this equation doesn’t require multiplying or dividing by a negative number, so
the inequity sign remains the same.
20. (C). Circumference equals π times diameter, and diameter is equal to two times the radius. Or
C = πd, and d = 2r. C = π30. If you round π to 3.14, the answer is about 94.2 or about 94 feet.
21. (A). Volume equals length times width times height (V = lwh). 12 × 8 × 10 = 960 cubic inches.
22. (C). In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are equal.
23. (A). All quadrilaterals have angles that total 360 degrees.
24. (B). 100 = 4 × 25 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 = 22× 52.
25. (B). The square root of a negative number doesn’t exist as far as real numbers are con-
cerned. In mathematics, this is called an imaginary number.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You can put your pencil down now — no more quizzes
or sample tests like the ones in Part V. This part is the
Part of Tens, which features our personal ASVAB top-ten
lists. We couldn’t write a For Dummies book and not include
this part.
We give you important information for doing well on the
ASVAB, offer some pointers for memorizing crucial con-
cepts, and point you in the right direction for finding more
information if you need it. This part presents material in
quick tidbits, so you can get into the chapters and then
get out! Good luck taking your ASVAB. We hope you get
stationed in Hawaii!

Chapter 24
Ten Sure-Fire Ways to Fail the ASVAB
In This Chapter
 Avoiding common ASVAB-preparation mistakes
 Steering clear of other people’s mistakes
T
echnically, you can’t “fail” the ASVAB. It’s not a pass/fail test but instead a tool the mili-
tary uses to measure your potential for learning military duties and military occupations.
Realistically, each of the branches have established minimum AFQT scores to qualify for
enlistment and minimum line scores to qualify for certain military jobs. If you don’t qualify to
join the service branch of your choice or don’t qualify for the job you want, you didn’t tech-
nically “fail,” but you may have to try to take the test again (after some study sessions) to get
into the branch of service your heart desires.
But if you avoid the mistakes outlined in this chapter, you can improve your chances of
qualifying for enlistment and getting the military job of your dreams.
Choosing Not to Study at All
Many people think that they don’t need to study for the ASVAB. They assume that because
they studied many of the subjects in high school, they’ll do fine even if they just wing it.
This train of thought isn’t true (and it’s kind of crazy). Why wouldn’t you study? At the very
least, brushing up on vocabulary and math concepts definitely helps you score higher on the
ASVAB.
Failing to Realize How Scores Are Used
The military powers-that-be use the nine subtests on the ASVAB to determine what military
jobs you qualify for. If you don’t know how the scores are used, you can’t decide which parts
of the exam are most important for you to study.
Check out Chapters 1 and 2 for an explanation of how the military uses ASVAB subtest scores
to determine your qualifications. Also head to the Appendix to see the scores that you need
to get into certain branches of and careers in the military.

Studying for Unnecessary Subtests
If you don’t want to be a mechanic in the military, what are you doing studying for the 
Auto & Shop Information subtest? You should be spending your time on the math and vocab-
ulary review because the math and vocabulary subtests of the ASVAB are used to compute
the all-important AFQT score, which determines whether you can join the military branch of
your choice.
It’s easier to study subject areas that you find easy or have an interest in, but if you’re already
an electronics wiz, don’t waste your time studying a subject area that you’re already going to
ace. Spend your time studying subject areas that you aren’t quite so confident of.
Losing Focus
We’re not going to sugarcoat this: The ASVAB is tiring. You have to take nine subtests that
cover some really diverse subjects. You have about two hours to complete the actual test, so
if you lose focus while you’re taking the test, time has a tendency of slipping away, and you
may not get to all the questions. It’s hard, but keep your mind focused on the task at hand
throughout the whole test. It’ll be over soon.
Here are some tips that can help you maintain focus:
 Arrive at the test location with time to spare. This gives you a few minutes to sit and
relax before you have to dive into the test questions.
 Leave your baggage at the door. Don’t worry about whether you’ll get the military job
you want or whether you’ll pass the physical the next morning. You’ll have plenty of
time to worry about that after you’ve finished the test.
 Concentrate on one subtest at a time. Don’t waste time rehashing the questions on the
previous subtest or trying to anticipate the questions on the next subtest. Focus on the
subtest you’re taking at the time.
 Take a few moments to relax and refocus between subtests. If you finish a subtest
with time to spare, close your eyes for a bit and take some deep breaths before you
begin the next subtest.
On the CAT-ASVAB, when you answer the final question on one subtest you move immediately
to the next subtest. If the timer on the computer screen says you have a few minutes of time
left on the subtest, use that time to relax and refocus before submitting that final answer.
Panicking Over Time
Yes, you only have a limited time to do the test, but don’t worry about it. The more you panic,
the more likely you are to make mistakes. Just work at a steady pace, and you’ll do fine.
Don’t spend too much time on any single question. If you’re drawing a blank, make a guess
and move on. (See “Making Wild Guesses or Not Guessing at All,” later in this chapter).
If you’re taking the CAT-ASVAB, there will be a timer on the computer screen, counting down
the number of minutes and seconds you have to finish that subtest. If you’re taking the
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

pencil and paper version of the test, check the clock on the wall, and the proctor will gener-
ally write the start and finish time for the current subtest on a chalk board. Keep your eye on
the time remaining, but don’t panic over it.
Deciding Not to Check the Answers
You should always double-check your answers before you commit to them — you don’t want
to be tripped up by silly mistakes. Don’t mark your answer and then check your work. Check
your work first.
Do not second-guess yourself (see “Changing Answers” later in this chapter). Just check for
accuracy (like in mathematical equations). Be sure to mark your answer sheet correctly, too —
making sure that the number of the questions matches the number on your answer sheet (you
don’t have to worry about this with the computerized version of the ASVAB). Getting just one
question off can mess up the rest of the answer sheet.
Making Wild Guesses or Not Guessing at All
Take the time to eliminate answers you know are incorrect before choosing among the
remaining answer options. And here’s the number one rule: Don’t leave any blank spaces. In
most cases, guessing if you have to is the way to go — at least you have a higher chance at
getting the right answer as opposed to a zero percent chance if you leave the answer blank.
If you can eliminate answers you know are wrong before guessing, you increase your chances
of answering correctly even more.
For tips on smart guessing, see Chapter 3.
Changing Answers
If you’re taking the paper version of the ASVAB, after you double-check your math, decide
that Choice (C) is correct, and mark it on the answer sheet, don’t change your answer! You’re
almost certain to change a right answer to a wrong one when you play that game. Plus, you
can drive yourself crazy by second-guessing (and third- and fourth-guessing) your decision.
Mark the answer and move on.
Memorizing the Practice Test Questions
Don’t waste your time trying to memorize the practice questions in this book. We can almost
guarantee you won’t see any of the practice questions in this book (or any other study guide)
on the actual ASVAB. Military test materials are highly-controlled items, and no author of an
ASVAB preparation book has access to them. In fact, military members and military civilian
employees who disclose actual ASVAB test questions or answers can go to jail — and we’re
not planning on going to the big house any time soon!
So just use the practice questions in this book as a measurement tool of what subject areas
you should spend your time concentrating on.

Chapter 24: Ten Sure-Fire Ways to Fail the ASVAB

Misunderstanding the Problem
Make sure that you know what the question wants from you and then give the question what
it wants. If the problem asks for the sum of two numbers, don’t multiply the numbers. Don’t
mistake a division sign for an addition sign. By familiarizing yourself with the types of ques-
tions on the ASVAB, you’ll be able to zero in on what it is you’re supposed to do a lot quicker
than those poor folks who didn’t have the brilliant idea to buy this book.

Ten Easy Ways to Improve 
Your ASVAB Score
In This Chapter
 Brushing up on math concepts
 Uncovering the hidden meaning of vocabulary words
 Improving your reading comprehension
 Coming to conclusions
C
ommonly referred to as the ASVAB Score, the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)
score is actually only computed from the reading and math skills subtests of the
ASVAB. The AFQT score is your most important score because it determines whether you’re
even qualified to enlist in the service of your choice. For the full scoop, see Chapter 1.
The ten concepts presented in this chapter help you score better on the four subtests of the
ASVAB that are used to calculate your AFQT score.
Changing Percents
In order to perform math operations, you often have to change a percent to a fraction or
a decimal. To change a percent to a fraction, multiply the percent by 1⁄100 and drop the
percent sign:
5% × 1⁄100 = 5⁄100
To change a percent to a decimal, move the decimal point over two places to the left and
drop the percent sign:
5% = 5.0% = 0.05
Clearing Up Inverse Confusion
Inverse operations are opposite operations. The opposite of addition is subtraction and vice
versa. And the opposite of multiplication is division and vice versa. But, when it comes to
numbers, the term inverse is not the same as opposite. The opposite of 5 is –5, but the inverse
of 5 is 1⁄5. When you deal with numbers, think of the inverse of a number as standing the
number on its head: The inverse of 5 (or 5⁄1) is 1⁄5.

Outlining the Order of Operations
When a math problem asks you to perform more than one operation, make sure to perform
the operations in the set-in-stone correct order:
1. Grouping symbols
On the ASVAB, the grouping symbols you run across are the fraction bar and the
square root sign. Do the square root first. Do any operation above the fraction bar
and then any operation below the fraction bar and then divide.
2. Parentheses
Do any mathematical operations contained within parentheses.
3. Multiplication and division
Always operate from left to right.
4. Addition and subtraction
Always operate from left to right.
Reviewing Ratios, Rates, and Scales
You need to understand the differences between ratios, rates, and scales in order to calculate
the answer to math questions correctly:
 A ratio represents a relationship between two like objects. If Luis invested $10 in Lotto
tickets, and Joe invested $20 in Lotto tickets, then for every one dollar Luis invested,
Joe invested two. That’s a ratio of 1:2.
 A rate is an expression of the relationship between two unlike elements. For example,
if Anna’s car can travel a distance of 450 miles per tank of gas, and her gas tank holds
15 gallons, then her car consumes gas at a rate of 30 miles to the (per) gallon or 30 mpg
(miles and gallons being unlike elements). Or, 450 (miles) ÷ 15 (gallons in the tank) =
30 miles to the gallon.
 A scale, like a ratio, expresses a relationship between two like elements, although
the units of measure may differ. A map drawn to scale may use one inch to represent
one mile. Although an inch and a mile aren’t the same unit of measure, they measure
the same thing (distance).
Calculating Area, Perimeter, and Volume
You encounter some math questions on the ASVAB that require you to calculate area,
perimeter, and volume. Remember the following rules:
 For any rectangle, area = base × height.
 For triangles, area = base × altitude (the height of the triangle at its highest point)
divided by two.
 For circles, area is πr2.
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 The perimeter of any quadrilateral (four-sided figure) or triangle is calculated by
adding the lengths of all the sides together.
 The perimeter (also called circumference) of a circle is found by multiplying π × diameter.
 The volume of a rectangular unit is found by multiplying length × width × height.
 The volume of a cylinder is found by multiplying the square of the radius of the base
by the height or V = πr2h.
Finding the Word Closest in Meaning
The Word Knowledge subtest of the ASVAB contains questions that ask you to find the word
that is closest in meaning to a given word. Don’t get confused and think that you have to find
the word that means exactly the same thing as the given word. Just follow the directions.
Because some of the answer options may have similar meanings, you need to choose the
answer that’s closest in meaning to the given word — the answer that’s most right.
Using Roots, Prefixes, and Suffixes
If you see an unfamiliar word on the Word Knowledge section, try to figure out its root. For
example, if you know the meaning of mercy, you can figure out the meaning of merciful.
Remember that prefixes and suffixes that can change the meaning of a word can be added
onto a root: Here are some examples:
 The prefix a- usually means opposite, so the word atypical means the opposite of typical
not a typical thing.
 Establish is a verb meaning to make stable or to prove, whereas establishment (with a
suffix) is a noun meaning a thing that has been established.
Getting to the Point
On the Paragraph Comprehension subtest, you can pretty much win the battle if you figure
out the main point of the paragraph. The main point is the essence of what the paragraph is
trying to communicate. The other information in the paragraph simply supports this point.
The main point is often, but not always, the first or last sentence in a paragraph.
Finding Specific Information
The Paragraph Comprehension subtest often asks you to find specific information in a pas-
sage. You shouldn’t have to guess what this information is — it’s written in the passage, or
you can easily deduce it from the passage. For instance, if a paragraph includes the sentence,
“Six out of ten smokers will contract some form of cancer,” and a question asks, “How many
smokers won’t contract some form of cancer?” you can easily deduce that four is the correct
number. Go back and reread the paragraph when you’re asked to find specific information.
349
Chapter 25: Ten Easy Ways to Improve Your ASVAB Score

Drawing Conclusions
You may have to draw inferences or conclusions from what you’ve read. You must use only
the information presented in the paragraph to reach this conclusion instead of relying on
your own ideas and opinions. In other words, ask yourself, “Would the author agree with this
statement, based on what he or she has written in this paragraph?” Apply this test to each
answer option to choose the best answer.

Appendix
Matching ASVAB Scores 
to Military Jobs
T
he military has hundreds of enlisted job opportunities, ranging from washing and
sewing clothing items to translating foreign languages. Each of the military services has
established its own individual line score requirements (a combination of various ASVAB sub-
test scores) to qualify for specific enlisted jobs. The tables in this appendix show the mini-
mum line scores that the services have established for entry-level enlisted jobs.
Just because you achieve the minimum ASVAB line score for the job of your choice doesn’t
mean you’ll absolutely get that job. Other factors are considered, including the current needs
of the service, security clearance qualification, and medical exam results.
The charts in this appendix are as accurate as they can be at press time. However, military
jobs and qualification standards are subject to change with little or no notice. For the most
up-to-date information and for complete job descriptions and qualification factors, see your
local military recruiter or visit the military enlisted-job pages on the About.com U.S. Military
Information site at http://usmilitary.about.com.
Army Enlisted Jobs
The army calls its enlisted jobs Military Occupation Specialties (MOS), and over 150 such spe-
cialties exist for entry-level recruits. Table A-1 shows entry-level army MOSs and the army
ASVAB line scores required to qualify for the jobs. Scan the table and see if you find a job that
interests you.
Line scores are abbreviated as follows: Clerical Score (CL), Combat Score (CO), Electronics
Score (EL), Field Artillery Score (FA), General Maintenance Score (GM), General Technical
Score (GT), Mechanical Maintenance Score (MM), Operators and Food Score (OF),
Surveillance and Communications Score (SC), and Skilled Technical Score (ST). See Chap-
ter 2 for an explanation of which ASVAB subtest scores are used to calculate each of the line
scores.

Air Force Enlisted Jobs
The United States Air Force has about 120 entry-level enlisted jobs for new recruits. The air
force refers to enlisted jobs as Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC). Table A-2 shows the air force
entry-level AFSCs and the line scores required to qualify for the job. The table is organized by
AFSC number, so browse the table and see which AFSCs pique your interest.
Line scores are abbreviated as follows: General (G), Electronic (E), Mechanical (M) and
Administrative (A). See Chapter 2 for information about which ASVAB subtest scores are
used by the air force to calculate the various line scores.

Appendix: Matching ASVAB Scores to Military Jobs

Navy Enlisted Jobs
The navy calls its enlisted jobs Ratings and has about 75 available for entry-level recruits.
They don’t use line scores for job qualification purposes. Instead, the navy combines scores
from the various ASVAB subtests for each of its enlisted ratings.
Table A-3 (in Ratings order) shows combinations of ASVAB subtest scores that are required
to qualify for navy enlisted jobs. Peruse the list and see what jobs might best suit you. The
ASVAB subtests are abbreviated as follows: General Science (GS), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR),
Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Auto & Shop (AS), Mathematics
Knowledge (MK), Mechanical Comprehension (MC), Electronics Information (EI), Assembling
Objects (AO), and Verbal Expression Score (VE).

ASVAB For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Marine Corps Enlisted Jobs
The United States Marine Corps needs a few good men (and women) to fill about 120 enlisted
entry-level job specialties. Like the army, the Marine Corps calls its enlisted jobs Military
Occupation Specialties (MOS). The Marine Corps has only three line scores, and they’re
abbreviated in Table A-4 as follows: Mechanical Maintenance (MM), Electronics (EL), and
General Technical (GT).
See Chapter 2 for information regarding which subtest scores of the ASVAB are used to com-
prise these line scores.

Coast Guard Enlisted Jobs
The smallest U.S. Military service, the Coast Guard only has 19 entry-level jobs for enlisted
members. Like the navy, the Coast Guard calls its enlisted jobs Ratings. Also like the navy, the
Coast Guard doesn’t use line scores for job qualification purposes. Instead it uses the sums
of various ASVAB subtest scores.
Table A-5 shows combinations of ASVAB subtest scores that are required to qualify for Coast
Guard enlisted jobs. The ASVAB subtests are abbreviated as follows: General Science (GS),
Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Auto &
Shop (AS), Mathematics Knowledge (MK), Mechanical Comprehension (MC), Electronics
Information (EI), Assembling Objects (AO), and Verbal Expression Score (VE).
