Preface
While project managers today still need to use many techniques that have stood the test
of twenty to fifty years, they increasingly also need to understand the business need for a
project, sort through multiple conflicting stakeholder demands, and know how to deal
with rapid change, a myriad of communication issues, global and virtual project teams,
modern approaches to quality improvement, and many other issues that are more chal-
lenging than in projects of previous times.
Contemporary project management utilizes the tried-and-true project management
techniques along with modern improvements such as the most current versions of
Microsoft® Project Professional 2013 and the fifth edition of the Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide). Contemporary project management
also uses many tools and understandings that come from modern approaches to quality
and communications, expanded role definitions, leadership principles, human strengths,
agile planning and execution, and many other sources. Contemporary project manage-
ment is scalable, using simple versions of important techniques on small projects and
more involved versions on more complex projects.
Distinctive Approach
This book covers the topics of contemporary project management. It was also developed
using contemporary project management methods. For example, when considering the
topic of dealing with multiple stakeholders, every chapter was reviewed by students,
practitioners, and academics. This allowed student learning, practitioner realism, and ac-
ademic research and teaching perspectives to be simultaneously considered.
The practical examples and practitioner reviewers came from many industries and
from many sizes and types of projects to promote the scalability and universality of con-
temporary project management techniques.
New to This Edition
•
Agile approach. The agile approach to project planning and management in which
planning and implementing are done incrementally is introduced in Chapter 1.
Throughout the book when the agile approach is different from the traditional, a
margin icon and alternate color print are used to emphasize the difference. In this
book’s contemporary approach to project management in practice, agile and tradi-
tional are both used extensively.
•
Updated to reflect the fifth edition of the PMBOK® Guide. All fifth edition
PMBOK® Guide knowledge areas and processes are specifically included. The end
of each chapter now contains ten PMBOK® Guide-type questions that are typical
of what would be seen on PMP® and CAPM® exams. Appendix A gives study
suggestions for the CAPM® and PMP® exams.
•
New examples throughout the text. Each chapter starts with a motivating example
for why the student would want to read the chapter and ends with an example of
how a company actually used some tools and/or concepts from the chapter. There
are many smaller examples throughout each chapter that illustrate specific points.
Many of these are new examples from around the world and from many different
industries such as the Fiesta® San Antonio Commission (Texas) and an IT rollout
xv

within a system of regional schools in Germany (Chapter 5); the rollout of a project
management tool to a South African banking group (Chapter 7); the Panama Canal
expansion (Chapter 10); the determination of supplier ratings at General Tool
Company in Ohio (Chapter 11); and the control, monitoring, and reporting of
projects at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (Chapter 14).
•
Microsoft® Project Professional 2013 fully integrated into the fabric of eight
chapters. Though techniques are demonstrated in a by-hand fashion, a demonstra-
tion of how to automate them using Microsoft® Project Professional 2013 is shown
in a step-by-step manner with numerous screen captures. On all screen captures,
critical path activities are shown in contrasting color for emphasis.
•
Project deliverables. A list of project deliverables that can be used for students
assignments are included after the expanded table of contents. Many instructors may
choose some but not all of these depending on class organization.
•
Templates. Electronic templates for many of the techniques (student deliverables)
are available on the textbook companion website. These Microsoft® Word and Excel
documents can be downloaded and filled in for ease of student learning and for
consistency of instructor grading.
Distinctive Features
•
PMBOK® Guide approach. This consistency with the established standard gives
students a significant leg up if they decide to become certified Project Management
Professionals (PMPs®) or Certified Associates in Project Management (CAPMs®).
All glossary definitions are from the PMBOK® Guide.
•
Actual project as learning vehicle. One section at the end of each chapter lists
deliverables for students to create (in teams or individually) for a real project. These
assignments have been refined over the last decade while working with the local
PMI® chapter, which provides a panel of PMP® judges to evaluate projects from a
practical point of view. Students are encouraged to keep clean copies of all deliver-
ables so they can demonstrate their project skills in job interviews. A listing of these
deliverables is included after the detailed table of contents.
•
Student oriented, measurable learning objectives. Each chapter begins with a listing
of the most important points students should learn and identifies the PMBOK®
topics covered in the chapter. The chapter material, end-of-chapter questions and
problems, PowerPoint® slides, and test questions have all been updated to correlate
to specific objectives.
•
Blend of classical and modern methods. Proven methods developed over the past
half century are combined with exciting new methods that are emerging from both
industry and research.
•
Executive, managerial, and associate roles. This book covers the responsibilities of
many individuals who can have an impact on projects so aspiring project managers
can understand not only their own roles, but also those of people with whom they
need to deal.
•
Balanced scorecard approach. Many factors are included in how project success is
measured and how project results are determined. An adaptation of the balanced
scorecard helps students understand how these fit together.
•
Integrated example project. An example project has been developed to demonstrate
many of the techniques throughout the book. That way students can see how the
various project planning and control tools develop and work together.

Preface

Organization of Topics
The book is divided into three major parts. Part 1, Organizing Projects, deals with both
the environment in which projects are conducted and getting a project officially
approved.
•
Chapter 1 introduces contemporary project management by first tracing the history
of project management, then discussing what makes a project different from an
ongoing operation. Various frameworks that help one understand projects—such as
the PMBOK® Guide—are introduced, as well as the executive-, managerial-, and
associate-level roles.
•
Chapter 2 discusses how projects support and are an outgrowth of strategic plan-
ning, how a portfolio of projects is selected and prioritized, how a client company
selects a contractor company to conduct a project, and how a contractor company
secures project opportunities from client companies.
•
Chapter 3 deals with organizational capability issues of structure, life cycle, culture,
and roles. The choices parent organizations make in each of these provide both
opportunities and limitations to how projects can be conducted.
•
Chapter 4 presents project charters in a step-by-step fashion. Short, powerful char-
ters help all key participants to develop a common understanding of all key project
issues and components at a high level and then to formally commit to the project.
Charters have become nearly universal in initiating projects in recent years. Micro-
soft® Project Professional 2013 is used to show milestone schedules within charters.
Part 2, Planning Projects, deals with all aspects of project planning as defined in the
PMBOK® Guide.
•
Chapter 5 introduces methods for understanding and prioritizing various stake-
holder demands and for building constructive relationships with stakeholders. Since
many projects are less successful than desired due to poor communications, detailed
communication planning techniques are introduced along with meeting
management.
•
Chapter 6 helps students understand how to determine the amount of work the
project entails. Specifically covered are methods for determining the scope of both
the project work and outputs, the work breakdown structure (WBS) that is used to
ensure nothing is left out, and how the WBS is portrayed using Microsoft® Project
Professional 2013.
•
Chapter 7 is the first scheduling chapter. It shows how to schedule activities by
identifying, sequencing, and estimating the durations for each activity. Then critical
path project schedules are developed, methods are shown for dealing with uncer-
tainty in time estimates, Gantt charts are introduced for easier communications, and
Microsoft® Project Professional 2013 is used to automate the schedule development
and communications.
•
Chapter 8 is the second scheduling chapter. Once the critical path schedule is de-
termined, staff management plans are developed, project team composition issues
are considered, resources are assigned to activities, and resource overloads are iden-
tified and handled. Schedule compression techniques of crashing and fast tracking
are demonstrated and multiple alternative scheduling techniques including Agile are
introduced. Resource scheduling is demonstrated with Microsoft® Project Profes-
sional 2013.
•
Chapter 9 deals with project budgeting. Estimating cost, budgeting cost, and
establishing cost controls are demonstrated. Microsoft® Project Professional 2013 is
used for developing both bottom-up and summary project budgets.
Preface
xvii

•
Chapter 10 demonstrates project risk planning. It includes risk management plan-
ning methods for identifying risks, establishing a risk register, qualitatively analyzing
risks for probability and impact, quantitatively analyzing risks if needed, and decid-
ing how to respond to each risk with contingency plans for major risks and aware-
ness for minor risks.
•
Chapter 11 starts by covering project quality planning. This includes explaining the
development of modern quality concepts and how they distill into core project
quality demands. Then the chapter covers how to develop a project quality plan and
how to utilize the simple project quality tools. It then ties all of the planning chap-
ters together with discussions of a project kick-off meeting, a baselined project plan,
and the ways Microsoft® Project Professional 2013 can be used to establish and
maintain the baseline.
Part 3, Performing Projects, discusses the various aspects that must be managed
simultaneously while the project is being conducted.
•
Chapter 12 deals with project supply chain management issues. Some of these issues,
such as developing the procurement management plan, qualifying and selecting
vendors, and determining the type of contract to use are planning issues, but for
simplicity they are covered in one chapter with sections on how to conduct and
control procurements and to improve the project supply chain.
•
Chapter 13 deals with leading and managing both the project team and stakeholders.
It includes acquiring and developing the project team, assessing both potential and
actual performance of team members and the team as a whole, various types of
power a project manager can use, and how to deal productively with project conflict.
•
Chapter 14 is concerned with determining project results. This chapter starts with a
balanced scorecard approach to controlling projects. Internal project issues covered
include risk, change, and communication. Quality is the customer issue. Financial
issues are scope, cost, and schedule, including how to use Microsoft® Project Pro-
fessional 2013 for control.
•
Chapter 15 deals with how to end a project—either early or on time. Included are
validating to ensure all scope is complete, formally closing procurements and the
project, knowledge management, and ensuring the project participants are rewarded
and the clients have the support they need to realize intended benefits when using
the project deliverables.

Introduction to Project Management
I have returned from a successful climb of Mt. Aconcagua in Argentina; at
22,841 feet, it is the highest peak in the world outside of the Himalayas.
While there, seven other climbers died; we not only survived, but our
experience was so positive that we have partnered to climb together again.
During the three decades that I’ve been climbing mountains, I’ve also
been managing projects. An element has emerged as essential for success
in both of these activities: the element of discipline. By discipline, I am
referring to doing what I already know needs to be done. Without this
attribute, even the most knowledgeable and experienced will have difficulty
avoiding failure.
The deaths on Aconcagua are an extreme example of the consequences
associated with a lack of discipline. The unfortunate climbers, who knew that
the predicted storms would produce very hazardous conditions, decided to
attempt the summit instead of waiting. They did not have the discipline that

project
management practices that I have come to rely on. For me, these practices
have become the pillars of my own project management discipline. One of
these pillars, planning, seems to be particularly susceptible to challenge.
Managing projects at the Central Intelligence Agency for three decades, I
adjusted to the annual cycle for obtaining funding. This cycle occasionally
involved being given relatively short notice near the end of the year that
funds unspent by some other department were up for grabs to whoever
could quickly make a convincing business case. While some may interpret
this as a circumstance requiring shortcutting the necessary amount of
planning in order to capture some of the briefly available funds, I understood
that my discipline required me to find a way to do the needed planning and to
act quickly. I understood that to do otherwise would likely propel me toward
becoming one of the two-thirds of the projects identified by the Standish
Group in their 2009 CHAOS report as not successful. I understood that the
top 2 percent of project managers, referred to as Alpha Project Managers in
a 2006 book of the same name, spend twice as much time planning as the
other 98 percent of project managers. The approach that I took allowed me
to maintain the discipline for my planning pillar. I preplanned a couple of
projects and had them ready at the end of the year to be submitted should a
momentary funding opportunity arise.
A key to success in project management, as well as in mountain climbing,
is to identify the pillars that will be practiced with discipline. This book offers
an excellent set of project management methods from which we can identify
those pillars that we will decide to practice with the required levels of
discipline. I believe that project management is about applying common
sense with uncommon discipline.

1-1 What Is a Project?
Frequently, a business is faced with making a change, such as improving an existing
work process, constructing a building, installing a new computer system, merging
with another company, moving to a new location, developing a new product, entering
a new market, and so on. These changes are best planned and managed as projects. So,
what is a project?
A project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product,
service, or result.”1 A project requires an organized set of work efforts that are
planned in a level of detail that is progressively elaborated upon as more information
is discovered. Projects are subject to limitations of time and resources such as money
and people. Projects should follow a planned and organized approach with a defined
beginning and ending. Project plans and goals become more specific as early work is
completed. The output often is a collection of a primary deliverable along with sup-
porting deliverables such as a house as the primary deliverable and warrantees and
instructions for use as supporting deliverables. Each project typically has a unique
combination of stakeholders—“an individual, group, or organization who may affect,
be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a
project.”2 Projects often require a variety of people to work together for a limited
time, and all participants need to understand that completing the project will require
effort in addition to their other assigned work.
Project management is “the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to
project activities to meet project requirements.”3 This includes work processes that initi-
ate, plan, execute, control, and close work. During these processes, tradeoffs must be
made among the following factors:
•
Scope (size)
•
Schedule
•
Quality (acceptability of the results)
•
Resources
•
Cost
•
Risks4
When project managers successfully make these tradeoffs, the project results meet the
agreed upon requirements, are useful to the customers, and promote the organization.
Project management includes both administrative tasks for planning, documenting, and
controlling work and leadership tasks for visioning, motivating, and promoting work
associates. Project management knowledge, skills, and methods can be applied and
modified for most projects regardless of size or application.
1-2 History of Project Management
Projects of all sizes have been undertaken throughout history. Early construction
projects included the ancient pyramids, medieval cathedrals, and Indian cities and
pueblos. Other large early projects involved waging wars and building empires. In
the development of the United States, projects included laying railroads, developing
farms, and building cities. Many smaller projects have consisted of building houses
and starting businesses. Throughout most of history, projects were conducted, but
there was very little systematic planning and control. Some early projects were
accomplished at great human and financial cost. Others took exceedingly long
periods of time to complete.
Project management eventually emerged as a formal discipline to be studied and prac-
ticed. In the 1950s and 1960s, techniques for planning and controlling schedules and
costs were developed, primarily on huge aerospace and construction projects. During
this time, project management primarily involved determining project schedules based
4
Part 1 Organizing Projects

on understanding the order in which work activities had to be completed. Many large
manufacturing, research and development, government, and construction projects used
and refined management techniques. In the 1980s and 1990s, several software companies
offered ever more powerful and easier ways to plan and control project costs and sche-
dules. Risk management techniques that were originally developed on complex projects
have increasingly been applied in a simplified form to less complex projects.
In the last few years, people have realized more and more that communication and
leadership play major roles in project success. Rapid growth and changes in the informa-
tion technology and telecommunications industries especially have fueled massive growth
in the use of project management in the 1990s and early 2000s. People engaged in banking,
insurance, retailing, hospital administration, and many other service industries are now
turning to project management to help them plan and manage efforts to meet their unique
demands. Project planning and management techniques that were originally developed for
large, complex projects can be modified and used to better plan and manage smaller pro-
jects. Now project management is commonly used on projects of many sizes and types in a
wide variety of manufacturing, government, service, and nonprofit organizations.
The use of project management has grown quite rapidly and is likely to continue
growing. With increased international competition, customers demand to have their pro-
ducts and services developed and delivered better, faster, and cheaper. Because project
management techniques are designed to manage scope, quality, cost, and schedule, they
are ideally suited to this purpose.
1-3 How Can Project Work Be Described?
Project work can be described in the following ways:
•
Projects are temporary and unique while other work, commonly called operations, is
more continuous.
•
Project managers need certain “soft skills” and “hard skills” to be effective.
•
Project managers frequently have more responsibility than authority.
•
Projects go through predictable stages called a life cycle.
1-3a Projects versus Operations
All work can be described as fitting into one of two types: projects or operations. Projects
as stated above are temporary, and no two are identical. Some projects may be extremely
different from any other work an organization has performed up to that time, such as
planning a merger with another company. Other projects may have both routine and
unique aspects such as building a house. Operations, on the other hand, consist of the
ongoing work needed to ensure that an organization continues to function effectively.
Operations managers can often use checklists to guide much of their work. Project man-
agers can use project management methods to help determine what to do, but they rarely
have checklists that identify all of the activities they need to accomplish. Some work may
be difficult to classify as totally project or totally operations. However, if project manage-
ment methods and concepts help one to better plan and manage work, it does not really
matter how the work is classified.
1-3b Soft Skills and Hard Skills
To effectively manage and lead in a project environment, a person needs to develop
both “soft” and “hard” skills. Soft skills include communication and leadership activ-
ities. Hard skills can include risk analysis, quality control, scheduling, budgeting, and
Chapter 1 Introduction to Project Management
5

so forth. Soft and hard skills go hand in hand. Some people have a stronger natural
ability and a better comfort level in one or the other, but to be successful as a proj-
ect manager a person needs to develop both along the judgment about when each is
needed. A wise project manager may purposefully recruit an assistant that excels in
his area of weakness. Training, experience, and mentoring can also be instrumental
in developing necessary skills.
1-3c Authority and Responsibility
A project manager will frequently be held accountable for work that she cannot or-
der people to perform. Projects are most effectively managed with one person being
assigned accountability. However, that person often needs to negotiate with a func-
tional manager, who is “someone with management authority over an organizational
unit … the manager of any group that actually makes a product or performs a
service.”5 Functional managers negotiate for workers to perform the project work in
a timely fashion. Since the workers know their regular manager often has other tasks
for them and will be their primary rater, they are tempted to concentrate first on the
work that will earn rewards. Hence, a project manager needs to develop strong com-
munication and leadership skills in order to persuade subordinates to focus on the
project when other work also beckons.
1-3d Project Life Cycle
All projects go through predictable stages called a project life cycle. A project life cycle is
“the series of phases that a project goes through from its initiation to its closure.”6 An
organization’s control needs are to be assured that the work of the project is proceeding
in a satisfactory manner and that the results are likely to serve its customer’s intended pur-
pose. The project customer is the person or organization that will use the project’s product,
service, or result. Customers can be internal to the organization (that is, part of the com-
pany that is performing the project) or external to the organization. Many different project
life cycle models are used for different types of projects, such as information systems,
improvement, research and development, and construction. The variations these pose will
be explored in Chapter 3. In this book we will use the following project stages (as seen in
the chapter opener Project Life Cycle diagram for all of the following chapters.):
•
Selecting and initiating—starts when an idea for a project first emerges and the
project is selected and planned at a high level, and ends when key participants
commit to it in broad terms.
•
Planning—starts after the initial commitment, includes detailed planning, and ends
when all stakeholders accept the entire detailed plan.
•
Executing—starts when the plan is accepted, and includes authorizing, executing,
monitoring, and controlling work until the customer accepts the project deliverables.
•
Closing and realizing—includes all activities after customer acceptance to ensure
project is completed, lessons are learned, resources are reassigned, contributions are
recognized, and benefits are realized.
The pace of work and amount of money spent may vary considerably from one life
cycle stage to another. Often, the selecting is performed periodically for all projects at a
division or corporate level, and then initiating is rather quick—just enough to ensure
that a project makes sense and key participants will commit to it. The planning stage can
become rather detailed and will normally require quite a bit more work. The execution
stage or stages are the time when the majority of the hands-on project tasks are
accomplished. This tends to be a time of considerable work. Closing is a time when loose
6
Part 1 Organizing Projects

ends are tied up and the work level decreases significantly, but realizing benefits from the
project occurs over time, may be measured months after project completion, and may be
done by people other than those who performed the project. See Exhibit 1.1 for a predic-
tive or plan-driven project life cycle and Exhibit 1.2 for an adaptive or change-driven proj-
ect life cycle. The primary difference is that in the first, the product is well-understood and
all planning precedes all executing, while in the second, early results lead into planning
later work. The extreme of predictive is sometimes called waterfall and the extreme of
adaptive is sometimes called agile. Agile will be defined in Chapter 3, but throughout the
book a margin icon will indicate ideas from agile, and the text will be in color.

Three other points should be made concerning the project life cycle. First, most com-
panies with well-developed project management systems insist that a project must
pass an approval of some kind to move from one stage to the next.7 In both exhibits,
the approval to move from selecting and initiating to planning, for instance, is the
approval of a charter. Second, in many industries, the project life cycle is highly formal-
ized and very specific. For example, in information systems, the executing stage is often
described as two stages: writing code and testing code. In the construction industry,
the executing stage is often described as the three stages of design, erection, and finish-
ing. Many companies even have their own project life cycle model, such as the one
Midland Insurance Company has developed for quality improvement projects as shown
in Exhibit 1.3. This book will present examples of company-specific life cycle models, but
for clarity will use the predictive or plan-driven model shown in Exhibit 1.1 when describing
concepts except when we discuss agile with the adaptive or change-driven model. Third, in
addition to stage-ending approvals, frequently projects are measured at additional points
such as selection, progress reporting, and benefits realization, as shown in Exhibit 1.1.
1-4 Understanding Projects
Several frameworks that can help a person better understand project management are
described below: the Project Management Institute (PMI); the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide); methods of selecting and prioritizing projects,
project goals and constraints; project success and failure; use of Microsoft Project to
help plan and measure projects, and various ways to classify projects.
1-4a Project Management Institute
Project management has professional organizations just as do many other professions
and industry groups. The biggest of these by far is the Project Management Institute.
It was founded in 1969, grew at a modest pace until the early 1990s, and has grown
quite rapidly since. As of March 2013, PMI had well over 650,000 members and creden-
tial holders in 185 countries. PMI publishes and regularly updates A Guide to the
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide). All of the definitions in this
book come from the PMBOK® Guide, fifth edition.8 PMI has established a professional
certification entitled Project Management Professional (PMP). To be certified as a PMP,

a person needs to have the required experience and education, pass an examination on
the PMBOK® Guide, and sign and be bound by a code of professional conduct. PMI has
also established a second certification—Certified Associate in Project Management
(CAPM)—that is geared toward junior people working on projects before they are eligi-
ble to become PMPs. PMI also has established additional credentials, practice standards,
and extensions of the PMBOK® Guide in areas such as program management, agile, risk,
scheduling,
resource
estimating,
work
breakdown
structures,
construction,
and
government.9
1-4b Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®)
The Project Management Body of Knowledge consists of a project life cycle (see earlier
“Project Life Cycle” section), 5 process groups, and 10 knowledge areas. A project man-
agement process group is “a logical grouping of the project management inputs, tools
and techniques, and outputs.”10 The five process groups, paraphrased from the PMBOK®
Guide, are as follows:
1. Initiating—“define a project or a new phase by obtaining authorization”
2. Planning—“establish the project scope, refine objectives and define actions to attain
objectives”
3. Executing—“complete the work defined to satisfy project specifications”
4. Monitoring and controlling—“track, review, and regulate progress and perfor-
mance, identify changes required, and initiate changes”
5. Closing—“finalize all activities to formally close project or phase”11
The 10 knowledge areas, paraphrased from the PMBOK® Guide, are as follows:
1. Integration management—“processes and activities to identify, define, combine,
unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities”12
2. Scope management—“processes to ensure that the project includes all the work
required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully”13
3. Time management—“processes to manage timely completion of the project”14
4. Cost management—“processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting,
financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be com-
pleted within the approved budget”15
5. Quality management—“processes and activities of the performing organization
that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project
will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken”16
6. Human resources management—“processes that organize, manage, and lead the
project team”17
7. Communications management—“processes to ensure timely and appropriate
planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control,
monitoring, and ultimate disposition of project information”18
8. Risk management—“processes of conducting risk management planning, identifi-
cation, analysis, response planning, and control … to increase the likelihood and
impact of positive events and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events
in the project”19
9. Procurement management—“processes to purchase or acquire products, services,
or results from outside the project team”20
10. Stakeholder management—“processes to identify the people, groups, or organiza-
tions, that could impact or be impacted by the project, analyze their expectations
and impact, and develop strategies for engaging them and managing conflicting
interests”21

1-4c Selecting and Prioritizing Projects
During the selecting and initiating stage of a project, one of the first tasks leaders must
do is to identify potential projects. Ideally, this is accomplished in a systematic manner—
not just by chance. Some opportunities will present themselves. Other good opportu-
nities need to be discovered. All parts of the organization should be involved. For exam-
ple, salespeople can uncover opportunities through open discussions with existing and
potential customers. Operations staff members may identify potential productivity-
enhancing projects. Everyone in the firm should be aware of industry trends and use
this knowledge to identify potential projects.
Once identified, organizations need to prioritize among the potential projects. The
best way to do this is to determine which projects align best with the major goals of
the firm. The executives in charge of selecting projects need to ensure overall organiza-
tional priorities are understood, communicated, and accepted. Once this common under-
standing is in place, it is easier to prioritize among the potential projects. The degree of
formality used in selecting projects varies widely. Regardless of the company’s size and
the level of formality used, the prioritization efforts should include asking the following
questions:
•
What value does each potential project bring to the organization?
•
Are the demands of performing each project understood?
•
Are the resources needed to perform the project available?
•
Is there enthusiastic support both from the external customers and from one or
more internal champions?
•
Which projects will best help the organization achieve its goals?
1-4d Project Goals and Constraints
All projects should be undertaken to accomplish specific goals. Those goals can be
described both by scope—“the sum of the products, services, and results to be provided
as a project”22 and by quality—“the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics ful-
fills requirements.”23 Taken together, scope and quality are often called performance and
should result in outputs that customers can be satisfied with as they use them to effec-
tively do their job. From a client perspective, projects generally have time and cost con-
straints. Thus, a project manager needs to be concerned with achieving desired scope
and quality, subject to constraints of time and cost. If the project were to proceed exactly
according to plan, it would be on time, on budget, with the agreed upon scope and the
agreed upon quality.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

However, many things can happen as a project is conducted. Obstacles or challenges that
may limit the ability to perform often arise, as well as opportunities to exceed original expec-
tations. A project manager needs to understand which of these four goals and constraints
(scope, quality, time, budget) should take precedence and which can be sacrificed. The project
manager needs to help the customer articulate how much he wants to enhance achievement
of one of these four dimensions. The customer must also state which dimension he is willing
to sacrifice, by how much, and under what circumstances to receive better achievement of
the other one. For example, on a research and development project, a customer may be
willing to pay an extra $5,000 to finish the project 10 days early. On a church construction
project, a customer may be willing to give up five extra light switches in exchange for greater
confidence that the light system will work properly. Understanding the customer’s desires in
this manner enables a project manager to make good project decisions. A project manager
can use a project customer tradeoff matrix such as the one in Exhibit 1.4 to reflect the
research and development project tradeoffs discussed above.
From an internal perspective a project manager also needs to consider two more con-
straints: the amount of resources available and the decision maker’s risk tolerance. From
an agile perspective, resources (including cost) and schedule are considered fixed and
what can vary is value to the customer.
1-4e Defining Project Success and Failure
Project success is creating deliverables that include all of the agreed-upon features (meet
scope goals). The outputs should satisfy all specifications and please the project’s custo-
mers. The customers need to be able to use the outputs effectively as they do their work
(meet quality goals). The project should be completed on schedule and on budget (meet
time and cost constraints).
Project success also includes other considerations. A successful project is one that is com-
pleted without heroics—that is, people should not burn themselves out to complete the proj-
ect. Those people who work on the project should learn new skills and/or refine existing
skills. Organizational learning should take place and be captured for future projects. Finally,
the performing organization should reap business-level benefits such as development of new
products, increased market share, increased profitability, decreased cost, and so on. A con-
temporary and complete view of project success is shown in Exhibit 1.5.
Project failure can be described as not meeting the success criteria listed in Exhibit 1.5.
Many projects are fully successful in some ways but less successful in others. The
goal of excellent project management is to reach high levels of success on all mea-
sures on all projects. Serious project failure—when some of the success criteria are

missed by a large amount and/or when several of the success criteria are missed—can be
attributed to numerous causes. In each chapter of this text, more specific possible failure
causes will be covered, along with how to avoid them, but some basic causes of failure
are as follows:
•
Not enough resources are available for project completion.
•
Not enough time has been given to the project.
•
Project expectations are unclear.
•
Changes in the scope are not understood or agreed upon by all parties involved.
•
Stakeholders disagree regarding expectations for the project.
•
Adequate project planning is not used.
1-4f Using Microsoft Project to Help Plan and Measure Projects
A useful tool to capture and conveniently display a variety of important project data is
Microsoft® (MS) Project. MS Project is demonstrated in a step-by-step fashion using
screen shots from a single integrated project throughout the book.
1-4g Types of Projects
Four ways to classify projects that help people understand the unique needs of each are
by industry, size, understanding of project scope, and application.
CLASSIFYING BY INDUSTRY Projects can be classified in a variety of ways. One
method is by industry, which is useful in that projects in different industries often
have unique requirements. Several industry-specific project life cycle models are in
use, and various trade groups and special interest groups can provide guidance. For
example, PMI had 39 specific communities of practice as of March 1, 2013, as shown
in Exhibit 1.6. These groups allow project managers worldwide to share and learn

Part 1 Organizing Projects

together. Many of those groups are devoted to specific challenges faced by project
managers in a particular industry.
CLASSIFYING BY SIZE Another method of classifying projects is by size. Large projects
often require more detailed planning and control. However, even the smallest projects
still need to use planning and control—just in a more simplified manner. For example,
construction of a multistory building in China would require a highly detailed construc-
tion schedule, but even a much simpler construction project of building a one-car garage
would also need to follow a schedule.
CLASSIFYING BY TIMING OF PROJECT SCOPE CLARITY A third method of classi-
fying projects deals with how early in the project the project manager and team are likely
to be able to determine with a high degree of certainty what the project scope will be.
For example, it may be rather simple to calculate the cubic feet of concrete that are
required to pour a parking lot and, therefore, how much work is involved. At the oppo-
site end of the spectrum, when developing a new pharmaceutical, very little may be
determined in the project until the results of some early experiments are reported. Only
at that time is it possible to begin estimating cost and determining the schedule with
confidence. The planning becomes iterative, with more detail as it becomes available. In
the first case, predictive or plan-driven project techniques may work well. In the second
case, adaptive or change-driven methods to iteratively determine the scope and plan for
risks may be more important.
CLASSIFYING BY APPLICATION For the purpose of this book, we will discuss many
types of projects, such as those dealing with organizational change, quality and pro-
ductivity improvement, research and development (R&D), information systems
(IS), and construction. Many of these projects include extensive cross-functional
work, which adds to the challenge. Remember, all projects require planning and con-
trol. Part of the art of project management is determining when to use certain tech-
niques, how much detail to use, and how to tailor the techniques to the needs of a
specific project.
A large construction project, like this multistory building in China, requires a highly detailed
construction schedule.

1-4h Scalability of Project Tools
Projects range tremendously in size and complexity. In considering construction projects,
think of the range from building a simple carport to building an office tower. In both
cases, one would need to determine the wants and needs of the customer(s), understand
the amount of work involved, determine a budget and schedule, decide what workers are
available and who will do which tasks, and then manage the construction until the owner
accepts the project results. It should be easy to see that while both projects require plan-
ning and control, the level of detail for the carport is a tiny fraction of that for the office
tower. In this book, we first demonstrate concepts and techniques at a middle level and
then use a variety of project examples to demonstrate how to scale the complexity of the
techniques up or down.
1-5 Project Roles
To successfully initiate, plan, and execute projects, a variety of executive, management,
and associate roles must be accomplished, as shown in Exhibit 1.7. In a large organiza-
tion, a person often fills only one of these roles; sometimes, more than one person fills a
particular role. In small organizations, the same person may fill more than one role. The
names of the roles also vary by organization. The work of each role must be accom-
plished by someone. Project managers are successful when they build strong working
relationships with the individuals who execute each of these roles.
1-5a Project Executive-Level Roles
The four project executive-level roles are the steering team, sponsor, customer, and the
chief projects officer. A steering or leadership team for an organization is often the top
leader (CEO or other officer) and his or her direct reports. From a project standpoint,
the important role for this team is to select, prioritize, and resource projects in accor-
dance with the organization’s strategic planning and to ensure that accurate progress is
reported and necessary adjustments are made.
The second executive-level project role is that of sponsor. PMI’s official definition of a
sponsor is “the person or group that provides resources and support for the project and
is accountable for enabling success.”25 This textbook expands the sponsor’s role to
include taking an active role in chartering the project, reviewing progress reports, playing
a behind-the-scenes role in mentoring, and assisting the project manager throughout the
project life.
The third executive-level project role is that of the senior customer representative. This
person ensures that the needs and wants of the various constituents in the customer’s orga-
nization are identified and prioritized and that project progress and decisions continually
support the customer’s desires. In agile projects, the customer representative role is contin-
uous and active. The chief projects officer’s role is sometimes called a project management
office (PMO), which is defined as “an organizational structure that standardizes the project
related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools
and techniques.”24 The PMO can range from supporting project managers, to controlling
them by requiring compliance to directive in actually managing projects.
1-5b Project Management-Level Roles
The most obvious management-level role is the project manager. The project manager is
“the person assigned by the performing organization to lead the team that is responsible
for achieving the project objectives.”63 The project manager is normally directly account-
able for the project results, schedule, and budget. This person is the main communicator,
A G I L E
14
Part 1 Organizing Projects

is responsible for the planning and execution of the project, and works on the project
from start to finish. The project manager often must get things done through the power
of influence since his or her formal power may be limited.
Another key management role is the functional manager. Functional managers are the
department heads—the ongoing managers of the organization. They normally determine
how the work of the project is to be accomplished, often supervise that work, and often
negotiate with the project manager regarding which workers are assigned to the project.
The third managerial role is that of facilitator. If the project is complex and/or con-
troversial, it sometimes makes sense to have another person help the project manager
with the process of running meetings and making decisions.
1-5c Scrum Master
In agile projects, a new title is introduced—the scrum master. In effect, this is a project
manager who serves and leads in a collaborative, facilitating manner.
1-5d Project Associate-Level Roles
The project management team is composed of “members who are directly involved in
project management activities.”27 In this book, these individuals are called core team
members. The core team, with the project manager, does most of the planning and
makes most of the project-level decisions.
The temporary members that are brought on board are called subject matter experts.
These people are used on an as-needed basis.
1-6 Overview of the Book
Contemporary project management blends traditional, plan-driven and contemporary,
agile approaches. It is integrative, iterative, and collaborative. Project management is in-
tegrative since it consists of the 10 knowledge areas and the 5 process groups described
in the PMBOK® Guide, and one must integrate all of them into one coherent and ethical
whole. Project management is iterative in that one starts by planning at a high level and
then repeats the planning in greater detail as more information becomes available and
the date for the work performance approaches. Project managers need to balance plan-
ning, control, and agility. Project management is collaborative since there are many sta-
keholders to be satisfied and a team of workers with various skills and ideas who need to
work together to plan and complete the project. With these thoughts of integration, iter-
ation, and collaboration in mind, this book has three major parts: Organizing and Initi-
ating Projects, Planning Projects, and Performing Projects.
1-6a Part 1: Organizing and Initiating Projects
Part 1 consists of four chapters that deal with organizing for and initiating projects.

CHAPTER 2 covers project selection and prioritization. This includes both internal pro-
jects, which should be selected in a manner consistent with the strategic planning of the
organization, and external projects. It also explains how to respond to requests for
proposals.
CHAPTER 3 focuses on organizational structure, organizational culture, project life
cycle, and project management roles of the parent organization. The organizational
structure section describes ways an organization can be configured and the advantages
and disadvantages of each in regard to managing projects. Next covered is the culture
of the parent organization and the impact it has on the ability to effectively plan and
manage projects. The industry and type of project often encourage managers to select
or customize a project life cycle model. The roles covered include executive-,
managerial-, and associate-level responsibilities that must be performed. The demands
of each role are explained, along with suggestions for how to select and develop people
to effectively fill each role, considering both the role and the unique abilities and inter-
ests of each person.
CHAPTER 4 discusses chartering projects. The project charter is “a document issued
by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project,
and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources
to project activities.”28 The charter can further be considered an agreement by which
the project sponsor and project manager (and often the project core team) agree at a
high level what the project is, why it is important, key milestone points in the
schedule, major risks, and possibly a few other items. It allows the project manager and
core team to understand and agree to what is expected of them. Finally, Microsoft Proj-
ect, a tool that facilitates effective project planning, controlling, and communicating, is
introduced. Microsoft Project is utilized in eight chapters to demonstrate how to auto-
mate various project planning and control techniques. The examples and illustrations in
this book use Microsoft Project 2013. If a person is using an earlier version of Microsoft
Project, there are slight differences. If a person is using a competing project scheduling
package, the intent remains the same, but the mechanics of how to create certain docu-
ments may differ.

1-6b Part 2: Planning Projects
Part 2 includes seven chapters dealing with various aspects of project planning.
CHAPTER 5 begins by identifying the various project stakeholders, their wants and
needs, and how to prioritize decisions among them. Chapter 5 also includes communica-
tions planning for the project because poor communication can doom an otherwise well-
planned and well-managed project. The information needs of each stakeholder group
should be included in the communications plan.
CHAPTER 6 shows how to determine the project scope and outline it in the work
breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS is “a hierarchical decomposition of the total
scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives
and create the required deliverables.”29 The WBS is a document that progressively breaks
the project down into its components so that each piece can be described as a deliverable
for which one person can plan, estimate the costs, estimate the time, assign resources,
manage, and be held accountable for the results. This is a critical document since it is
the foundation for most of the other planning and control. The chapter ends with
instructions on putting a WBS into Microsoft Project.
CHAPTER 7 deals with scheduling projects. The project schedule “presents linked
activities with planned dates, durations, milestones and resources.”30 This chapter starts
with a background on project scheduling and then covers construction of schedules by
defining activities, determining the order in which they need to be accomplished, esti-
mating the duration for each, and then calculating the schedule. Chapter 7 also includes
instructions on how to interpret a project schedule; clearly communicate it using a bar
chart called a Gantt chart; and use Microsoft Project to construct, interpret, and commu-
nicate project schedules.
CHAPTER 8 demonstrates how to schedule resources on projects: determining the need
for workers, understanding who is available, and assigning people. All of the techniques
of resourcing projects are integrated with the behavioral aspects of how to deal effectively
and ethically with the people involved. Resource needs are shown on a Gantt chart de-
veloped in Chapter 7, the responsibilities are shown as they change over time, conflicts
and overloads are identified, and methods for resolving conflicts are introduced. Alterna-
tive approaches for creating and compressing schedules are shown. Many of the techni-
ques in this chapter are also shown with MS Project.
CHAPTER 9 A project budget, the subject of this chapter, is dependent on both the
schedule and the resource needs developed in the previous two chapters. The budget is
“the approved estimate for the project or any work breakdown structure component or
any schedule activity.”31 Cost planning, estimating, budgeting, establishing cost control,
and using MS Project for project budgets are all included.
CHAPTER 10 starts with establishing a risk management plan. It covers methods for
identifying potential risks and for determining which risks are big enough to justify
specific plans for either preventing the risk event from happening or dealing effec-
tively with risk events that do happen. Finally, in risk response planning, strategies
for dealing with both positive risks (opportunities) and negative risks (threats) are
discussed.
CHAPTER 11 begins with a discussion of how modern project quality concepts have
evolved. Then it deals with core project quality demands of stakeholder satisfaction,
empowered performance, fact-based management, and process management. The third
Chapter 1 Introduction to Project Management
17

chapter topic is developing the project quality plan. Next, the chapter describes various
quality improvement tools for projects.
Since this is the last planning chapter, it concludes with a method of integrating
the various sections developed in the previous chapters into a single, coherent project
plan. Conflicts that are discovered should be resolved, judgment needs to be applied
to ensure that the overall plan really makes sense, and one or more kickoff meetings
are normally held to inform all of the project stakeholders and to solicit their enthu-
siastic acceptance of the plan. At this point, the project schedule and budget can be
baselined in MS Project. While bits of the project that might have caused delays if
they were not started early may already be in progress, the formal kickoff is the sig-
nal that the project is underway!
1-6c Part 3: Performing Projects
Part 3 includes four chapters that deal with performing the project.
CHAPTER 12 begins by introducing relevant supply chain concepts such as a supply
chain view of projects, the components that form a supply chain, factors to consider
when dealing with a supply chain, and methods of improving the performance of a
supply chain. Make-or-buy analysis and contract types lead the reader through pro-
curement planning. Identifying and selecting sellers lead into managing contracts to
assure receipt of promised supplies and services according to contractual terms. The
chapter ends with advantages and requirements of effective project partnering.
CHAPTER 13 describes how to carry out the project work with a project team in order
to accomplish the project objectives. The project manager needs to simultaneously cham-
pion the needs of the project, the team, and the parent organization. The project man-
ager manages the people side of the project by effectively using the stages of project team
development, assessing and building the team members’ capability, supervising their
work, managing and improving their decision making, and helping them maintain
enthusiasm and effective time management. Project managers guide their team in
managing and controlling stakeholder engagement.
CHAPTER 14 While the project work is being performed, the project manager needs to
determine that the desired results are achieved—the subject of this chapter. Monitor and
control project work is defined as “the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the
progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan.”32
This starts with gathering performance data already identified during project initiating
and planning. The actual performance data are then compared to the desired perfor-
mance data so that both corrective and preventive actions can be used to ensure that
the amount and quality of the project work meet expectations. MS Project can be used
for this progress reporting and for making adjustments. Earned value analysis is used to
determine exactly how actual cost and schedule progress are compared with planned
progress. Overcoming obstacles, managing changes, resolving conflicts, reprioritizing
work, and creating a transition plan all lead up to customer acceptance of the project
deliverables.
CHAPTER 15 deals with finishing projects and realizing benefits. Close project or phase
is defined as “the process of finalizing all activities across all of the project process groups
to formally close a project or phase.”30 This chapter includes a section on terminating
projects early, in case either the project is not doing well or conditions have changed and
the project results are no longer needed, and a section on timely termination of successful
projects. Topics include how to secure customer feedback and use it along with the team’s
18
Part 1 Organizing Projects

experiences to create lessons learned for the organization; reassign workers and reward
those participants who deserve recognition; celebrate success; perform a variety of closure
activities; and provide ongoing support for the organization that is using the results of the
project. Finally, after the project deliverables have been used for some time, an assessment
should determine if the promised benefits are being realized.
Summary
A project is an organized set of work efforts undertaken
to produce a unique output subject to limitations of
time and resources such as money and people. Since
the world is changing more rapidly than in the past,
many people spend an increasing amount of their
working
time
on
projects.
Project
management
includes work processes that initiate, plan, execute,
monitor and control, and close project work. During
these processes, tradeoffs must be made among the
scope, quality, cost, and schedule, so that the project
results meet the agreed-upon requirements, are useful
to the customers, and promote the organization.
All projects, regardless of size, complexity, or appli-
cation, need to be planned and managed. While the
level of detail and specific methods vary widely, all
need to follow generally accepted methods. PMI is a
large professional organization devoted to promoting
and standardizing project management understanding
and methods. One of PMFs standards, A Guide to the
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®
Guide), is composed of 5 process groups: initiating,
planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and
closing; along with 10 knowledge areas: integration,
scope, time, cost, quality, human resources, communi-
cations, risk, procurement, and stakeholders.
To successfully initiate, plan, and execute projects, two
more things are needed. One is to understand what proj-
ect success is and what drives it, along with what project
failure is and its major causes. The other is an under-
standing of the various executive-, managerial-, and
associate-level roles in project management. This book
is organized to be useful to students who will enter a
variety of industries and be assigned to projects of all sizes
and levels of complexity. Students will learn how to
understand and effectively manage each of these process
groups and knowledge areas. Microsoft Project 2013 is
used in eight chapters to illustrate how to automate vari-
ous planning, scheduling, resourcing, budgeting, and
controlling activities. All definitions used are from the
PMBOK Guide, fifth edition. This book follows a chrono-
logical approach throughout a project’s life cycle, empha-
sizing knowledge and skills that lead to project success.

5.
Projects pass through a series of phases as they
move from initiation to project closure. The
names and number of these phases can vary
significantly depending on the organization,
the type of application, industry, or technology
employed. These phases create the framework for
the project, and are referred to collectively as the:
a. project life cycle
b. project management information system (PMIS)
c. product life cycle
d. quality methodology
6.
Based on PMI’s definition, which of these is a
good example of a project?
a. manufacturing a standard commodity
b. following policies and procedures for procur-
ing an item
c. designing and launching a new website
d. using a checklist to perform quality control
7.
The responsibilities of a project management of-
fice (PMO) and the degree of control that it
provides can cover a broad spectrum. All of these
are examples of types of PMO structures within
organizations except:
a. controlling—require compliance through
various means
b. selective—review business cases and select and
prioritize projects to be initiated
c. supportive—perform a consultative role
through training, templates, and best practices
d. directive—provide a high degree of control by
directly managing the projects
8.
When would a predictive project life cycle be the
preferred approach?
a. when the high-level vision has been developed,
but the product scope is not well defined
b. when the environment is changing rapidly
c. when the product to be delivered is well
understood
d. when the product will be created through a
series of repeated cycles
9.
To be effective, a project manager needs
to possess all of the following competencies except:
a. personal effectiveness—attitudes, core person-
ality traits, leadership
b. authority—power or right granted by the
organization
c. performance—what project managers can
accomplish while applying their project man-
agement knowledge
d. knowledge of project management—under-
standing of project management tools and
techniques
10.
In Adaptive Life Cycles (change—driven or agile
methods) ________.
a. the overall scope of the project is fixed,
and the time and cost are developed
incrementally
b. the overall cost is fixed, and the project scope
and schedule are developed iteratively
c. the time and cost are fixed, but the scope is
developed iteratively
d. change control is very important
Example Project Instructions
This book is designed to give your professors the
option to have you practice the concepts and techni-
ques from each chapter on a real project. Often, the
project chosen will be for a nonprofit group of some
kind such as a United Way agency, a church, or a
school. The project could, however, be for a company
or a part of the university. For traditional classes,
the example project can often be one that several stu-
dents will be assigned to work on as a team. For online
classes, it may be more practical to have each student
work on a separate project at his or her place of
employment.
Chapter 1 Introduction to Project Management
21

Each chapter provides suggested assignments to
practice project management skills on the real or
potential project you are using. Depending on the
emphasis your professor chooses, you may need to per-
form some, most, or all of these assignments. At a min-
imum, your professor will probably assign the charter,
work breakdown structure, and schedule.
In any case, each chapter after this prompts you to
perform various activities to plan and execute the proj-
ect. At some point in the first couple of weeks, your
professor will probably invite at least one representative
from each organization to your class to introduce
their project and to meet you. We will call these per-
sons sponsors and define their role more fully in
Chapter 3. Since this first chapter is a broad introduc-
tion to project management, your task for the Chapter 1
sample project is to familiarize yourself with your new
student team, your sponsor, your sponsor’s organiza-
tion, and the overall direction of your project. Your
professor may ask you to answer certain specific and/or
open-ended questions concerning your newly assigned
project.
Subsequent chapters give you more in-depth tools to
acclimatize you to your project, the organization you
will be working for, and the various stakeholders who
have an interest in the project. For example, in the next
chapter, you learn how project selection flows from an
organization’s strategic planning, and you should seek
to learn why this project was chosen and how it sup-
ports the strategic goals of the organization.

Using Appreciative Inquiry to Understand Project Management
Each project creates a unique product, service, or result
that certain stakeholders desire. Project success
requires understanding stakeholder requirements,
clarifying project expectations, and agreeing upon
project scope. As such, it is imperative to identify
relevant stakeholders and to have a constructive
engagement with them. One tool that is helpful for
allowing such engagement and for navigating through
complexities is Appreciative Inquiry (Al).
What Is Appreciative Inquiry?
The principles: Appreciative inquiry is a positive
philosophy for change wherein whole systems convene to
inquire for change (Cooperrider 2003). Al recognizes the
power of the whole and builds on conversational learning
that emerges out of the whole. It operates on the belief that
human systems move in the direction of their shared
image and idea of the future, and that change is based on
intentional and positive inquiry into what has worked best
in the past. In this sense, Al suggests that human
organizing and change is a relational process of inquiry
that is grounded in affirmation and appreciation. Typically,
the process works its way through the four phases of
Discovery, Dream, Design, and Delivery (Conklin, 2009).
Implications of Al on Defining Project
Scope
Project success partially depends upon identifying key
stakeholders: eliciting their true wants and needs to
determine project scope; and keeping them
appropriately engaged throughout the entire project.
The early involvement is critical because it lays out
clear goals and boundaries of project scope. However,
eliciting accurate responses may be difficult,
especially since many projects may be planned and
conducted in an atmosphere of uncertainty. The
ongoing involvement helps to ensure stakeholders
know what they will get from the project and will be
pleased.
Appreciative inquiry is a tool that may assist project
stakeholders to navigate through their inquiries via
positive conversations. For example, a typical process
may look like this:
Discovery (What has been?): This phase inquires
into and discovers the positive capacity of a group,
organization, or community. People are encouraged
to use stories to describe their strengths, assets,
peak experiences, and successes to understand the
unique conditions that made their moments of
excellence possible. In this step, stakeholders reflect
on the past to recollect instances when they
believed they could clearly articulate their true
needs and wants; and when their needs and wants
were folded into the project scope. Through story-
telling, they collectively discover the process of
project selection and prioritization, and articulate a
gauge of project success. As they discuss, they start
generating a dense web of understanding—an
understanding and an appreciation of all their
capacities that make moments of excellence
possible. Agile projects use a similar method of
story telling to understand user requirements and
ultimately define project scope.
Dreaming (What could be?): Building on the
moments of excellence of the participants, this phase

encourages the participants to imagine what would
happen if their moments of excellence were to become
a norm. Participants dream for the ideal conditions and
build hope and possibility of an ideal future. As people
share their stories, the focus of the process now shifts
to dreaming a perfect, desirable state for the
stakeholders. Through this journey, the goal should be
to enable the participants to build positive energy
around their strengths and also to dream about the
direction in which they feel comfortable moving.
Designing (What should be?): This phase creates
design principles that will help the participants realize
their dream. Participants are encouraged to stretch
their imagination to move the system from where it
currently is to where the participants want it to be.
At this stage, the participants should be encouraged
to imagine a perfect world without any constraints.
Therefore, if there were no resource constraints, what
would the scope of the project look like.
Delivery (What will be?): In this phase, participants
are encouraged to think of the various subsystems that
should take the responsibility of the design phase to
“sustain the design from the dream that it discovered”
(Cooperrider et al., 2003, p. 182). In this phase, various
stakeholders are encouraged to decide what they will
be committing themselves to.
Key Outcome
Going through this entire process allows stakeholders
to elicit and articulate their expectations from the
project. Stakeholders also have a better understanding
of how their needs and wants link to and lead them to a
desirable future state. Finally, in order to sustain their
dream, their commitment is clearly articulated. As
stakeholders commit themselves to specific endeavors
on the project, they will implicitly revisit the opportunities
and cost that lay ahead of them which allows
stakeholders to draw a realistic boundary around their
commitment to the project.
Projects are temporary and unique, and may have
shifting boundaries over time. The process of engaging
stakeholders via appreciative inquiry (AI) is an effective
way to address the ambiguity and uncertainty in
project management.

Project Selection and Prioritization
How does a truly global company with fewer than 200 associates achieve
noteworthy results and market leadership? Certainly strong and talented
people are a key part of the answer. A good set of leadership and
management tools and processes, and the discipline to use them, is another
key. A small, privately held company in Louisville, Kentucky, has been
fortunate to use both talent and process to achieve success by any measure.
That company is D. D. Williamson.
D. D. Williamson was founded in 1865 and today is a global leader in non-
artificial colors. Operating nine facilities in six countries and supplying many

D. D. Williamson identified the need to improve project management as a
key strategy to achieve the vision. Our weakness was twofold—we had too
many projects, and the projects that were active were sometimes late, over
budget, and not achieving the desired results. We began by creating a
prioritization matrix to select 16 “critical projects” that would have senior
leadership sponsors and be assigned trained and capable project managers
to improve our execution.
The prioritization matrix was a great initial step to narrow our focus and
improve our results—overall project completion improved. However, 16
projects meant that the scope and impact of projects still had wide variation.
Smaller, simpler projects were likely to be executed brilliantly and improve
our total percentage of “on time and on target” projects, but if the project
that was late or over budget was very high impact, we were still leaving
opportunities for growth and profitability on the table.
We next improved our prioritization process, selecting no more than
five “Vision Impact Projects” (VIPs) that would get high-level focus and
attention—monitoring and asking for corrective measures in weekly senior
management meetings, tracking online in our project management system
for
our

time
and
resources to help when projects get off course.
The results are dramatic—large and complicated projects are getting the
attention and resources and are achieving our strategic target of “on time,
on budget and on target” regularly. Our successes have positioned D. D.
Williamson to continue to do what we do best—serve customers effectively,
grow our business, and return strong financial results to ensure a solid
future for the business.

2-1 Strategic Planning Process
One of the tasks of a company’s senior leadership is to set the firm’s strategic direction.
Some of this direction setting occurs when an organization is young or is being
revamped, but some needs to occur repeatedly. Exhibit 2.1 depicts the steps in strategic
planning and how portfolio management should be an integral part.
2-1a Strategic Analysis
The first part of setting strategic direction is to analyze both the external and internal
environments and determine how they will enhance or limit the organization’s ability
to perform. This strategic analysis is often called strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats (SWOT). The internal analysis (elements within the project team’s control)
consists of asking what strengths and weaknesses the organization possesses in itself. The
external analysis (elements over which the project team has little or no control) consists
of asking what opportunities and threats are posed by competitors, suppliers, customers,
regulatory agencies, technologies, and so on. The leaders of an organization often need to
be humble and open to ideas that are unpleasant when conducting this analysis. Per-
formed correctly, a strategic analysis can be very illuminating and can suggest direction
for an organization. An example of SWOT analysis for the Built Green Home at Sunca-
dia is shown in Exhibit 2.2. (The Built Green Home at Suncadia, Washington, was devel-
oped using advanced sustainability concepts and a large degree of stakeholder
involvement. A more detailed description of this house appears in Chapter 5.)
2-1b Guiding Principles
Once the SWOT analysis is complete, the organization’s leadership should establish guid-
ing principles such as the vision and mission. Some organizations break this step into
more parts by adding separate statements concerning purpose and/or values. Often, these

Guiding Principles:

sections are included in the mission. For simplicity’s sake, they will be treated as part of
the mission in this book. It is more important to understand the intent of each portion
and achieve it rather than worry about the exact format or names of individual portions.
VISION The vision “must convey a larger sense of organizational purpose.”1 It should
be both inspiring and guiding, describing the organization as it can be in the future,
but stated in the present tense. A clear and compelling vision will help all members
and all stakeholders of an organization understand and desire to achieve it. Visions often
require extra effort to achieve but are considered to be worth the effort. Visions are often
multi-year goals that, once achieved, suggest the need for a new vision.
One of the visions most often cited, because it was so clear and compelling, was President
John F. Kennedy’s goal of placing a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. Kennedy
set this goal after Russia launched Sputnik and the United States found itself behind in the
space race. His vision was very effective in mobilizing people to achieve it.
A more recent example was in 2009 when hundreds of community leaders in Cleve-
land, Ohio, decided to use a systems approach to guide many interrelated social and
economic efforts in their region. The vision they stated is “Cleveland and other cities
throughout Northeast Ohio should be green cities on a blue lake….”2 They use this
vision to guide regional leaders as they choose where to invest their time and resources
in bettering the region and life for its residents.
Increasingly companies are incorporating the triple bottom line into their vision state-
ments. This approach emphasizes the social, environmental, and economic health of
all of the company’s stakeholders rather than a narrow emphasis only on the economic
return for shareholders. This stated desire to be a good corporate citizen with a
long-term view of the world can motivate efforts that achieve both economic return for
shareholders and other positive benefits for many other stakeholders.

MISSION STATEMENT The vision should lead into the mission statement, which is a
way to achieve the vision. The mission statement includes the “organization’s core
purpose, core values, beliefs, culture, primary business, and primary customers.”3 Several
of these sections may flow together in the mission statement and, sometimes, an overall
statement is formed with expanded definitions of portions for illustration. The rationale
for including each section (either as one unified statement or as separate statements) is
as follows:
•
By including the organization’s purpose, the mission statement communicates why
the organization exists.
•
By including the organization’s core values, a mission statement communicates how
decisions will be made and the way people will be treated. True organizational
values describe deeply held views concerning how everyone should act—especially
when adhering to those values is difficult.
•
By including beliefs, a mission statement communicates the ideals for which its lea-
ders and members are expected to stand. Beliefs are deeply held and slow to change,
so it is quite useful to recognize them, as they can either help or hinder an organi-
zation’s attempt to achieve its vision.
•
By including the organization’s culture, the mission statement instructs members to
act in the desired manner.
•
By including the primary business areas, everyone will know in what business the
organization wishes to engage.
•
By identifying the primary customers, everyone will understand which groups of
people need to be satisfied and who is counting on the organization. The mission
needs to be specific enough in describing the business areas and customers to set
direction, but not so specific that the organization lacks imagination. An example of
a vision and mission statement from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
is shown in Exhibit 2.3.

2-1c Strategic Objectives
With the strategic analysis, mission, and vision in place, leaders turn to setting strategic
objectives, which should be means of achieving the mission and vision. For most organi-
zations, this strategic alignment of objective setting occurs annually, but some organiza-
tions may review objectives and make minor revisions at three- or six-month intervals.
While the planning is normally performed annually, many of the strategic objectives
identified will take well over one year to achieve. The objectives describe both short- and
long-term results that are desired along with measures to determine achievement. Orga-
nizations that embrace a triple bottom line in their guiding values will have objectives
promoting each bottom line, and projects that are selected will contribute toward each.
These objectives should provide focus on decisions regarding which projects to select and
how to prioritize them, since they are an expression of the organizational focus. Many
writers have stated that for objectives to be effective, they should be “SMART—that is
specific, measurable, achievable, results-based, and time-specific.”4 An example of strate-
gic objectives from The Internet Society is shown in Exhibit 2.4.
2-1d Flow-Down Objectives
Once an organization’s strategic objectives are identified, they must be enforced. Some
objectives may be implemented by work in ongoing operations. However, projects tend
to be the primary method for implementing many objectives. If the organization is rela-
tively small, leaders may proceed directly to selecting projects at this point. Larger orga-
nizations may elect a different route. If the organization is so large that it is impractical
for the overall leaders to make all project selection decisions, they might delegate those
decisions to various divisions or functions with the stipulation that the decisions should
be aligned with all of the organization’s strategic planning that has taken place to this
point. Regardless of whether the organization is small and the top leaders make all proj-
ect selection decisions or whether the organization is large and some of the decisions are
cascaded one or more levels down, several methods of project selection may be used.
2-2 Portfolio Management
Companies that use a strategic project selection process to carefully align projects with their
organizational goals will find they tend to be more successful at completing their projects
and deriving the expected benefits from them. Portfolio management “aligns with organi-
zational strategies by selecting the right projects, prioritizing work, and providing needed
resources.”5 “The goal of portfolio management is to achieve the maximum benefit toward
the strategic goals of the company. To accomplish this, executives need to identify, select,
prioritize, resource, and govern an appropriate portfolio of projects and other work.”6
Governing will be covered in Chapter 14, and all other portfolio management topics will be

covered here. Project success at these companies is measured by how much the project con-
tributes to the organization’s objectives (business needs) as well as the traditional measures
of staying within budget and schedule and achieving the specific technical goals promised at
the start of the project so as to obtain a desired return on investment.
For ease of understanding how various work is related, many organizations utilize an
approach of classifying portfolios, programs, projects, and subprojects. Not all companies
use all four classifications, but understanding how they are related helps one see where
any particular portion of work fits in the organization.
2-2a Portfolios
Organizations require many work activities to be performed, including both ongoing
operational work and temporary project work. Large organizations often have many pro-
jects underway at the same time. A portfolio is “projects, programs, subportfolios, and
operations managed as a group to achieve strategic business objectives.”7 Project portfo-
lios are similar to financial portfolios. In a financial portfolio, efforts are made to diver-
sify investments as a means of limiting risk. However, every investment is selected with
the hope that it will yield a positive return. The returns on each investment are evaluated
individually, and the entire portfolio is evaluated as a whole.
Each project in the portfolio should have a direct impact on the organization. Put
another way, an organization’s leaders should identify the organization’s future direction
through strategic planning. Then multiple possible initiatives (or projects) can be identi-
fied that might help further the organization’s goals. The leaders need to sort through
the various possible projects and prioritize them. Projects with the highest priority
should be undertaken first. Organizations typically try to have a sense of balance in their
portfolios. That is, an organization includes in its portfolio:
•
Some large and some small projects
•
Some high-risk, high-reward projects, and some low-risk projects
•
Some projects that can be completed quickly and some that take substantial time to
finish
2-2b Programs
A program is “a group of related projects, subprograms, and program activities managed
in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.”8
Programs often last as long as the organization lasts, even though specific projects within
a program are of limited duration. For example, the U.S. Air Force has an engine pro-
curement program. As long as the Air Force intends to fly aircraft, it will need to acquire
engines. Within the engine program are many individual projects. Some of these projects
are for basic research, some are for development of engines, and others are for purchas-
ing engines. Each project has a project manager, and the entire program has a program
manager. While the project managers are primarily concerned with the tradeoffs of cost,
schedule, scope, and quality on their individual projects, the program manager is con-
cerned with making tradeoffs between projects for the maximum benefit of the entire
program. To avoid confusion, programs deal with a specific group of related projects,
while a portfolio deals with all of an organization’s projects. A portfolio can include mul-
tiple programs as well as multiple projects.
While the leadership group of a company may make portfolio decisions and delegate
the program management decisions to a program manager, both portfolios and programs
are managed at a level above the typical project manager. For practical purposes, project
managers should attempt to understand how both portfolio and program decisions impact
their projects and then spend most of their efforts focused on their project.
32
Part 1 Organizing Projects

2-2c Projects and Subprojects
Just as a program is made up of multiple projects, a large project may be composed of
multiple subprojects. A subproject is “a smaller portion of the overall project created
when a project is subdivided into more manageable components or pieces.”9 If the proj-
ect is quite large, individuals may be assigned as subproject managers and asked to man-
age their subproject as a project. Some of those subproject managers may even work for
another company. The project manager needs to coordinate the various subprojects and
make decisions that are best for the overall project. Sometimes this may require that a
particular subproject be sacrificed for the greater project good. The relationships among
a portfolio, programs, projects, and subprojects are illustrated in Exhibit 2.5.
Because projects are frequently performed in a fast-paced environment, it is helpful if
they can be guided by organizational priorities. Some of the most typical reasons for
project failure are:
•
Not enough resources
•
Not enough time
•
Unclear expectations
•
Changes to the project
•
Disagreement about expectations
The first step in overcoming these problems is to carefully align potential projects
with the parent organization’s goals. While many companies are motivated to align
projects with organizational goals for these benefits, an additional reason for companies
that sell to the government is that the Federal CIO Roadmap “ensures IT projects align
to agency mission and business need.”10 This was introduced in the Sarbanes-Oxley
requirements. All publicly traded companies must now follow certain guidelines that
require some sort of financial decision model to be made in deciding to do a project.
When managers assess the organization’s ability to perform projects and then iden-
tify, select, prioritize, resource, and govern a portfolio of projects and other work that
they believe will help the organization achieve its strategic goals, they are performing
portfolio management. While the majority of the portfolio management activities may
be conducted by a team of senior executives, project managers should understand how

their specific projects are aligned with the organization’s objectives since they will need
to either make or provide input on many decisions.
When companies consider their entire portfolio of work, they sometimes envision
projects as means of developing knowledge that can be capitalized upon in ongoing
work processes to provide profit, as shown in Exhibit 2.6.
In times when the economy is poor, many companies straggle to get enough business.
In such an environment, some firms might accept almost any work they can get. Even
during bleak economic times, however, one should be careful how internal projects are
selected, since selecting one project limits resources (money, people, etc.) available to
other projects. During good or bad economic times, people should take the same care with
external projects—ensure that they are consistent with the organization’s goals.
2-2d Assessing an Organization’s Ability to Perform Projects
Assessing an organization’s strengths and weaknesses is an essential part of aligning projects
with the organization; if an organization does not have the right capabilities, a project that
may otherwise support organizational goals may be too difficult to successfully complete.
Some questions to ask regarding a firm’s ability to support projects are as follows:
•
Do we have a teamwork attitude, free and open communication, creativity, and
empowered decision making?
•
Do we have a clearly defined project management process?
•
Do our associates have the right attitudes, skills, and competencies to use the project
management process?
•
Are our leaders at each level willing to take appropriate personal risk?
•
Does senior leadership establish a strong leadership foundation?
•
Do individuals and teams exhibit leadership at their respective levels?
•
Do we monitor and understand our external environment?

Part 1 Organizing Projects

2-2e Identifying Potential Projects
The second part of aligning projects with the firm’s goals is to identify potential projects.
These potential projects can be in response to a market demand, strategic opportunity,
social need, environmental consideration, customer request, legal requirement, or tech-
nological advance.11 Ideally, this is accomplished in a systematic manner—not just by
chance. Some opportunities will present themselves to the organization. Other good
opportunities will need to be discovered. All parts of the organization should be
involved. This means people at all levels, from front-line workers to senior executives, and
people from all functional areas need to help identify potential projects. For example, sales-
people can uncover many opportunities by maintaining open discussions with existing and
potential customers, and operations staff may identify potential productivity-enhancing pro-
jects. Everyone in the firm should be aware of industry trends. Many industries have trade
journals such as Elevator World or Aviation Week and Space Technology that can be read
regularly for potential project ideas. One reasonable goal is to identify approximately twice
as many potential projects as the organization has time and resources to perform. Under
close examination, some potential projects may not be a good fit. Any company that
accepts practically every potential project will probably waste some of its resources on pro-
jects that do not support its organizational goals.
Once potential projects are identified, the next step is to develop a brief description of
each. The leadership team that will select and prioritize projects needs to understand the
nature of the projects they are considering. While the level of documentation different
firms require varies greatly, a bare minimum can be called the elevator pitch. This is
when a person meets another waiting for an elevator and asks, “I hear you are on XYZ
Project. What is it all about?” The responder may have only a brief time to give a reply
before the elevator arrives and must be prepared to answer quickly with simple state-
ments about the project work and why it is important to the organization. The work is
often summarized in a brief statement of work, which is a “narrative description of pro-
ducts, services, or results to be provided by the project.”12 Why the project is important
is often summarized as a business case, which “describes the necessary information from
a business standpoint to determine if the project is worth the required investment.”13
The business case generally includes both why the project is needed and, if the firm
uses financial justification as part of project selection, an estimate of costs and benefits.
Armed with this elevator pitch, the series of processes that collectively are used to select,
prioritize, and initiate projects begins as shown in Exhibit 2.7. The rectangles represent

work processes, and the documents represent inputs into and deliverables out of the
work processes. Some of this work will be described in Chapters 4 and 5.
2-2f Methods for Selecting Projects
The people in charge of selecting projects need to ensure overall organizational priorities
are understood, agreed upon, and communicated. Once this common understanding is
in place, it is much easier to prioritize potential projects. The degree of formality used
in selecting projects varies widely. In a small company, it can be straightforward. The
prioritization should include asking questions such as these:
•
What value does each potential project bring to the organization?
•
Are the demands of performing each project understood?
•
Are the resources needed to perform the project available?
•
Is there enthusiastic support both from external customers and from one or more
internal champions?
•
Which projects will best help the organization achieve its goals?
There are several different methods of systematically selecting projects. The methods
include both financial and scoring models. The primary reason for including financial
analysis—either to make the project selection decisions directly or to at least assist in
the decision making—is that, from management’s perspective, projects are investments.
Therefore, proper selection should yield a portfolio of projects that collectively contribute
to organizational success.
Three different approaches are commonly used to ensure both financial and non-
financial factors are considered when selecting projects. First, some organizations use
financial analysis as the primary means of determining which projects are selected,
and management merely tempers this with informal inclusion of nonfinancial factors.
Second, some organizations use financial models as screening devices to qualify pro-
jects or even just to offer perspective; qualified projects then go through a selection
process using a scoring model. Third, at still other organizations, financial justifica-
tion is one factor used in a multifactor scoring model. The common thread in all three
of these approaches is that both financial and nonfinancial factors are considered
when selecting projects. Let us consider both financial and scoring models. Financial
models will be covered in concept, but the calculations will not be shown since they
are explained in depth in most required finance courses. Scoring models will be
covered in both concept and calculation since many students might not have them in
another course.
2-2g Using a Cost-Benefit Analysis Model to Select Projects
Cost-benefit analysis is “a financial analysis tool used to determine the benefits provided by a
project against its costs.”14 These models compare expected project costs to expected project
benefits. Several models can be used in making project selection decisions.
NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) Net present value (NPV) is the most widely accepted
model and will be covered first. When using net present value, the analyst first discounts
the expected future value of both the project costs and benefits, recognizing that a dollar
in the future is worth less than a dollar today. Then the analyst subtracts the stream of
discounted project costs from the stream of discounted project benefits. The result is the
net present value of the potential project. If the net present value is positive, then the
organization can expect to make money from the project. Higher net present values pre-
dict higher profits. See the summary in Exhibit 2.8.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

BENEFIT-COST RATIO (BCR) A second financial model sometimes used is benefit-cost
ratio (BCR). The ratio is obtained by dividing the cash flow by the initial cash outlay.
A ratio above 1.0 means the project expects to make a profit, and a higher ratio than
1.0 is better.
INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR) The third financial model is internal rate of return
(IRR). In this model, the analyst calculates the percentage return expected on the project
investment. A ratio above the current cost of capital is considered positive, and a higher
expected return is more favorable.
PAYBACK PERIOD (PP) The fourth financial model that is sometimes used is the pay-
back period (PP). In this analysis, a person calculates how many years would be required
to pay back the initial project investment. The organization would normally have a stated
period that projects should be paid back within, and shorter payback periods are more
desirable.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EACH METHOD Financial models are
useful in ensuring that selected projects make sense from a cost and return perspective.
Several models have weaknesses that need to be understood before they are used. For
example, payback period models do not consider the amount of profit that may be gen-
erated after the costs are paid. Thus, two projects with a similar payback period could
look equal, but if one has substantially higher revenue after the payback period, it would
clearly be superior. BCR would not be acceptable unless all costs and benefits were cal-
culated in present dollars (in which case it is similar to NPV except it is a ratio of ben-
efits to cost instead of the difference between revenue and cost). IRR and BCRs have
problems if used for choosing between mutually exclusive projects because they can favor
smaller projects that create less total value for the firm but have high percentage returns.
For example, a huge project with a medium rate of return would create a lot of value for
a firm but might not be picked over a smaller project with a higher return if only one
can be chosen. Additionally, it is sometimes quite difficult to calculate an IRR if a project
has nonconventional cash flows. For the most part, the finance field recommends using
net present value. The other measures can be calculated to provide perspective on
whether a project passes a minimum financial return threshold or to communicate with
people who might not understand NPV.

However, none of the financial models ensure alignment with an organization’s strategic
goals. Therefore, financial analysis, while very useful, is normally not enough.
2-2h Using a Scoring Model to Select Projects
In addition to ensuring that selected projects make sense financially, other criteria often need
to be considered. A tool called a scoring model helps to select and prioritize potential pro-
jects. It is useful whenever there are multiple projects and several criteria to be considered.
IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CRITERIA These criteria should include how well each
potential project fits with the organization’s strategic planning. The criteria may also
include such items as risk, timing, resources needed, and so on. A normal practice is
for the company’s leadership team to jointly determine what criteria will be used to
select projects. A list of questions executives may use to develop their list of criteria is
shown in Exhibit 2.9.
DETERMINING MANDATORY CRITERIA Once the leadership team agrees on a list of
criteria that are important, the next step is to determine whether any of the criteria are
mandatory. That is, are there any situations that dictate a project must be chosen regard-
less of any other considerations? Examples of this include government mandates and
clear safety or security situations. This list of “must do” projects should be kept as small
as possible since these projects automatically get selected and can crowd out other
worthwhile projects.
WEIGHTING CRITERIA Next, the leadership team determines the relative importance
or weight of each decision criteria. While more complex methods of determining criteria
weights and project evaluations have been used in the past, many firms now use the sim-
ple methods described here for determining criteria weights. See Exhibit 2.10 for an
example of project evaluations. First, executives determine which criterion is most
important and give that a weight of 10. Then they ask how important in comparison
each of the other criteria is. For example, if the executives in a consumer products com-
pany thought development of new products was most important, it would be assigned a
weight of 10. If the customer relations factor was deemed almost as important as new
product development, maybe it would be assigned 8. If the factors of supplier relations
and probability of project success were each deemed to be half as important as new
product development, each would be assigned 5. Perhaps other criteria such as cost
EXHIBIT 2.9
EXAMPLES OF PROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA
• How well does this project fit with at least one organizational objective?
• How many customers are there for the expected results?
• How competitively can the company price the project results?
• What unique advantages will this project provide?
• Does the company have the resources needed?
• What is the probability of success?
• Are the data needed to perform the project available or easily collected?
• Do the key stakeholders agree that the project is needed?
• What is the expected return on investment?
• How sustainable will the project results be?
• How does this project promote (or hinder) our corporate social responsibility?
• What risks are there if we do not perform this project?

Part 1 Organizing Projects

reduction, safely, and so forth were also considered but determined to not be as impor-
tant. The resulting criteria with weights are shown in Exhibit 2.10 in the top row of the
selection and prioritization matrix. Most organizations will decide to use about three to
five criteria. Lesser-rated criteria can be used as tie breakers if needed.
EVALUATING PROJECTS BASED ON CRITERIA Now the leadership team evaluates
each project on each criterion. The most efficient and accurate method is to concentrate
on one criterion at a time, going down each column in turn. An easy method for this is
to rate each project on that particular criterion with scores ranging from 1 (potential
project has very little or even negative impact on this criterion) to 5 (project has excel-
lent impact on this criterion). The upper left portion of each cell in the matrix can dis-
play the rating, representing how well that project satisfies that criterion.
Once a project has been rated on a particular criterion, that rating should be multi-
plied by the weight assigned to that criterion and displayed as the weighted score in the
main body of each cell. The total for each project should be added across the row. The
highest-scoring projects would ordinarily be selected. If several projects have close scores
(virtual ties), other criteria or discussion can be used to break the tie. For example, in
Exhibit 2.11, there is a virtual tie between Projects A and B.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES Scoring models allow leadership teams to perform sensitivity
analyses—that is, to examine what would happen to the decision if factors affecting it
were to change. Selection criteria may be added or altered. Participants may decide that
some criteria are more important than others and weight them accordingly. Missing cri-
teria or new alternatives can be added and the decision revisited. For example, if the
executive team evaluating the projects in Exhibit 2.11 had a bad experience with an
unsuccessful project and decided to reevaluate their decisions with success probability
now weighted a 9 for very important, the new project selection and priority matrix
would be calculated as shown in Exhibit 2.12.
Decision makers can ensure that they use very solid ratings for each potential project.
For example, if one criterion was the number of customers, the marketing department
could interview some potential customers to gauge their level of interest.
A company might want to select several projects. If so, the scores from the selection
matrix could serve as one method of prioritizing the projects.

2-2i Prioritizing Projects
Once all projects have been selected, they will need to be prioritized—that is, the deci-
sion makers will need to determine which ones will get assigned resources and be sched-
uled to begin first. If a company selects a number of projects for a year (or even for a
fiscal quarter), it cannot expect to start all of them at the same time. The scoring models
are useful in providing input into the starting order of projects. Most leadership teams
will consider the weighted scores of each project as a starting point in assigning
resources to projects and determining their start dates. The leadership team members,
however, also generally discuss other issues such as:
•
The urgency of each project
•
The cost of delaying the expected benefits from various projects
•
Practical details concerning the timing

Part 1 Organizing Projects

For example, an important process improvement project may be far less disruptive to
perform when the factory is shut down for routine maintenance. One more discussion
frequently occurs in the prioritizing process—if there is a conflict between resource needs
for two projects, which one gets the needed resources first? Often, this is left to the proj-
ect sponsors to iron out; for especially important projects, it may be formally decided by
the leadership team. In that way, the probability of the critical project being held up by a
misunderstanding is greatly decreased.
Exhibit 2.13 shows how the Alternative Breaks (AB) planning committee at a univer-
sity ranked spring break projects. This exhibit shows four of the twenty-six projects that
were selected for trips. This book will include multiple examples of the AB project to
illustrate how various project planning tools work together. Each trip is a small project
while the combination of all twenty-six trips form the overall project.
2-2j Resourcing Projects
Once all projects have been prioritized, it is time to assign resources to each. Resources can
include key personnel such as sponsors, project managers, core team members, and subject mat-
ter experts. It can also include money, space, and equipment that may be in short supply. The
easiest way is to use a resource assignment matrix and begin by assigning resources to the high-
est priority projects. Once an individual resource is no longer available, the organization is
limited in the number of projects that it can take on during a particular time. Assigning
resources like this requires a prioritized project list such as shown in Exhibit 2.12, a list of
resources and how much of each is available, and an estimate of how much of each key
resource each project will need. For simplicity’s sake, companies often plan for a fiscal quarter.
Exhibit 2.14 shows the same four projects and choices of project managers, team members, and
money for each. Note, while there is enough project manager time to start all four projects, there
is not enough team member time nor enough cash. Therefore, only three projects can be started.
2-3 Securing Projects
The discussion above pertains to projects that are internal to an organization. This sec-
tion deals with projects a company (called the client) wants performed, but for which it
may hire external resources (called contractors) to execute significant parts or all of the
work. External projects can be viewed either from the perspective of the client company
that wants the project to be executed or from the perspective of the contractor company
that wants to perform the work. Client companies may first put prospective external

projects through a selection and prioritization process as described above and, if selected,
then decide whether to perform the work internally (make) or hire the project to be per-
formed by others (buy). If the decision is to buy, then the client company needs to plan
and conduct the procurement.
Contractor companies need to identify potential project opportunities, determine
which they will pursue, submit proposals, and be prepared to either bid or negotiate to
secure the work. We consider the client company’s perspective in Chapter 12, Project
Supply Chain Management. We consider the contractor’s perspective next.
2-3a Identify Potential Project Opportunities
Contractors seeking external projects to perform should pursue this in a fashion similar
to that of any company considering internal projects, as described earlier in this chapter
in the portfolio alignment section on identifying potential projects. Additionally, since
they need to look externally, contractor companies should have representatives at trade
shows, professional conferences, and anywhere information on the intentions of poten-
tial customers and competitors may surface. Contractor companies should also actively
practice customer relationship management by establishing and nurturing personal con-
tacts at various levels and functions. Contractor companies can also practice customer
relationship management by linking information systems to the extent practical so as to
identify any useful information concerning potential future projects and improve man-
agement of current projects.
2-3b Determine Which Opportunities to Pursue
Just as all companies should decide which internal projects to select, as previously
described in the methods for selecting projects, most contractor companies are best
served by targeting the projects they wish to pursue. Some companies have a policy
that they will bid on every potential project, knowing that if they do not bid, they will
not be awarded the project. More companies find that if they target their opportunities,
their “hit rate” or probability of securing the work on any given proposal increases. It

takes time and resources to put together a good proposal, so it makes sense to increase
the acceptance rate by developing a bid/no-bid decision strategy.
Each company has strengths and weaknesses compared to its competitors. Hence, a
quick SWOT analysis could be used to decide whether to pursue a potential project,
just as a more involved version of SWOT analysis was described earlier and depicted in
Exhibit 2.2. Decision makers can also ask how well a potential project will help achieve
their objectives. If they determine a project will help achieve their objectives, the next
considerations are the cost to pursue the work and the probability of successfully secur-
ing the project given the likely competition. A company frequently considers risks both
of pursuing and not pursuing a potential project. Finally, does the company have the
capability to perform the work if it is awarded?
2-3c Prepare and Submit a Project Proposal
When a firm prepares to submit a proposal, it is really conducting a small project with
the primary deliverable of the project being a compelling and complete proposal. The
contractor should understand the project’s source selection criteria, the “set of attributes
desired by the buyer which a seller is required to meet or exceed to be selected for a
contract.”14 While criteria will vary extensively from one project to another, generally
a client will likely want to be convinced that the potential contractor is technically,
managerially, financially, and operationally competent. Successful project managers try
hard to convince potential clients that they are capable on all four dimensions. A short
list of these factors is shown in Exhibit 2.15.
Many companies find that targeting their opportunities is a better use of their time and resources than
bidding on every potential project.

2-3d Negotiate to Secure the Project
Once all proposals have been delivered and evaluated, the client company may elect to
either award the project or enter into negotiations with one or more potential contrac-
tors. On more routine projects, the contract may be awarded at this point. Further clar-
ifications and negotiations may follow for complex projects.
A client company and a contractor company may negotiate the amount of money to
be paid for a project. They may also negotiate the contractual terms, schedule, specific
personnel to be assigned to work on the contract, quality standards, reporting mechan-
isms, and various other items. A project manager may need to make arrangements with
potential suppliers to secure the products and services needed to perform the project. All
of these considerations will be covered in subsequent chapters.
Successful project managers understand that they need to prepare well for negotia-
tions. This starts with a clear understanding of what is most important to their manage-
ment. Often, it includes fact-finding with the client company to understand its needs and
abilities. Armed with understanding of both perspectives, a project manager attempts to
find a solution that allows the organization to secure the project work with enough profit
potential and with the start of a good working relationship with the client. In the end,
the client company will select the contractor(s) and award the contract(s).
Summary
Project selection does not occur in isolation. Ideally, it
begins with the organization’s strategic planning. This
planning begins with a strategic analysis of the organiza-
tion’s internal strengths and weaknesses as well as the
external threats and opportunities it faces. The organiza-
tion should then develop its guiding principles such as
mission and vision statements. Most companies will
have an annual planning session in which strategic objec-
tives are developed. Larger organizations will continue
this effort with one or more levels of planning in which
the overall objectives are flowed down to determine
objectives that are appropriate for each organizational level.
Once the strategic planning is accomplished, the
organization’s leadership team engages in portfolio
management. The first part is an open and honest
assessment of the organization’s ability to perform pro-
jects. The decision makers need to understand how
many resources are available, the organization’s overall
capabilities, and the capabilities of the individuals who
will be assigned to projects. An ongoing portfolio man-
agement activity is for everyone in the firm to identify
possible opportunities that they feel might help the
organization achieve its goals. Each potential project
should be described at least by stating in a sentence
or two what work is involved and how it would help
the organization achieve one or more of its goals.
Once potential projects are identified and briefly
described with statements of work and business cases,
they should be put through a process to determine
which will be selected and what their relative priori-
ties are. Both financial and scoring models are fre-
quently used to evaluate potential projects. Net
present value is the preferred financial method,
although others are sometimes used. Financial analy-
sis tells the leadership team how much each potential
project is worth from a benefits-versus-cost compari-
son, but does not tell how each potential project may
help to achieve the organization’s goals. Scoring mod-
els can incorporate various goals and should also be
used. Once a project list is selected, the projects need
to be prioritized so some can start right away and
others can start later.
Contractor companies need to be constantly on
the
lookout
for
potential
project
opportunities.
Once potential projects are identified, companies
need to decide which ones they pursue. Just as for
internal projects, some external projects will be bet-
ter at helping an organization reach its goals because
they are a better fit. The contractor needs to prepare
and submit proposals for desired projects and be
prepared to follow up and often negotiate in order
to secure them.

Example Project Instructions
Your instructor will probably bring example projects
to class and facilitate the assignment of students to
the various project teams. Therefore, you will proba-
bly not be involved in the project selection. However,
one of the first things you should do when assigned
to a project is to learn about the company or other
organization that wants the project to be completed.
Why did they select this project? Is it a “must do”
project or did it get picked over other competing
projects? By understanding what makes the project
so important, you will make better decisions and
will be more motivated through the term. If your
project is a “must do” project, explain why. If it is
not a “must do” project, explain how it was selected.
Explain where it fits in priority with other work of
the organization.

Prioritizing Projects at D. D. Williamson
One of the most difficult, yet most important, lessons we
have learned at D. D. Williamson surrounds project
prioritization. We took three years and two iterations of
our prioritization process to finally settle on an approach
that dramatically increased our success rate on critical
projects (now called VIPs, or “Vision Impact Projects”).
Knowing that one of the keys to project
management success is key management support, our
first approach at prioritization was a process where our
entire senior management team worked through a set
of criteria and resource estimations to select a
maximum of two projects per senior management
sponsor—16 projects in total. Additionally, we hired a
continuous improvement manager to serve as both our
project office and a key resource for project facilitation.
This was a great move forward (the year before we had
been attempting to monitor well over 60 continuous
improvement projects of varying importance). Our
success rate improved to over 60 percent of projects
finishing close to the expected dates, financial
investment, and results.
What was the problem? The projects that were not
moving forward tended to be the most critical—the
heavy-investment “game changing” projects. A review
of our results the next year determined we left
significant money in opportunity “on the table” with
projects that were behind and over budget!
This diagnosis led us to seek an additional process
change. While the criteria rating was sound, the
number of projects for a company our size was still too
many to track robustly at a senior level and have
resources to push for completion. Hence, we elevated a
subset of projects to highest status—our “VIPs.” We
simplified the criteria ratings—rating projects on the
level of expected impact on corporate objectives, the
cross-functional nature of the team, and the perceived
likelihood that the project would encounter barriers
which required senior level support to overcome.
The results? Much better success rates on the big
projects, such as design and implementation of new
equipment and expansion plans into new markets. But
why?
The Global Operating Team (GOT) now has laser
focus on the five VIPs, reviewing the project plans
progress and next steps with our continuous
improvement manager in every weekly meeting. If a
project is going off plan, we see it quickly and can
move to reallocate resources, provide negotiation help,
or change priorities within and outside the organization
to manage it back on track. Certainly, the unanticipated
barriers still occur, but we can put the strength of the
entire team toward removing them as soon as they
happen.
A couple of fun side benefits—it is now a
development opportunity for project managers to take
on a VIP. With only four to six projects on the docket,
they come with tremendous senior management
interaction and focus. Additionally, we have moved our
prioritization process into our functional groups, using
matrices with criteria and resource estimations to
prioritize customer and R&D projects with our sales,
marketing, and science and innovation teams, as well
as IT projects throughout the company. The
prioritization process has become a foundation of our
cross-functional success!
Following are excerpts from the spreadsheet D. D.
Williamson used to select and prioritize our VIP
projects last year. Exhibit 2.16 shows the five criteria
used to prioritize the projects. Exhibit 2.17 shows
how associate time when assigned to a project is not
available for other projects. Note all executives
agreed to spend up to 120 hours this quarter on
projects and Brian is overallocated—meaning either
he will need to do extra work, something needs to be
assigned to another person, or one less project can
be completed.

Organizational Capability: Structure,
Culture, and Roles
Over the last 15 years, my company (Atos Origin) has been through three
significant mergers/acquisitions and has seen good growth. As new lines of
businesses and employees have been added, we have become truly a global
company, where people from many countries where our businesses operate
come together to present the best solution to our clients. An excellent
example is the work we do for the Olympics games (Atos Origin has been
the worldwide IT partner for the Olympics for several years).
The overall project life cycle for most of the projects in the company
follows the typical IT project management approach. What has evolved over
time is the use of employees from different regions of the world to service a
client need. For instance, we have onsite operations for a client in the United
States and in Europe. The development and testing work is done offshore in
India. The onsite team members are primarily the program manager, project
managers (who deal with the client), business analysts, and technical
architects. The offshore team members include designers, developers, and

testers. There are also project managers who lead the team in India and
interact with their onsite counterpart on a regular basis.
The entire operation is managed through a program management office
(PMO) that is responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and ensuring delivery of
all the projects. It is a matrix structure where the team members report into
the PMO as well as their functional heads in their countries. The PMO has its
own culture of hard work, striving toward goals in a step-by-step manner, and
promoting team spirit. It fits right into our overall organization culture of
getting things done for the client, promoting innovation and conviviality, and
never compromising on ethical behavior.
I have observed that adaptability and empathy are helpful strengths for
project managers in this environment. Adaptability because the different
locations bring with them a set of challenges, including the ability to hold
the global team together. Empathy is extremely useful as well. Although the
project manager may not agree with the choices made by team members, he
or she must respect them.
Recently we had a team member from India absent from work for over
two weeks because his father was seriously ill. Typically in the United States
that would not be the case. Most people live away from their parents here
and are not able to take so much time off for their illness. In India, parents
often live with and are cared for by their children. The project manager from
the United States understood the Indian culture well enough to know that
until the team member’s father was well enough, he would have to arrange
for a different resource to perform on the project. Fortunately, because of his
traits of adaptability and empathy, he had recognized this up front and was
able to achieve his project timeline.
It is important for you, as a student of project management, to understand
and appreciate that organizations are different and are continuously evolving.
Entities in an organization in different parts of the world are different. Team
members have different strengths and weaknesses. Clients have different
expectations from a global company. As a project manager, you will need to
use your strengths to ensure that all your stakeholders are happy before,
during, and after project delivery.

3-1 Types of Organizational Structures
Contemporary companies choose among various methods for establishing their organi-
zational structure. Organizational structure can be considered to include work assign-
ments, reporting relationships, and decision-making responsibility. Each method of
structuring organizations has strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we will investi-
gate various organizational methods and the impact of each on managing projects. The
advantages and disadvantages of each organizational form are discussed in the following
sections and then summarized in Exhibit 3.5.
3-1a Functional
A functional organization is “a hierarchical organization where each employee has one
clear superior, staff are grouped by areas of specialization, and managed by a person with
expertise in that area.”1 This is the traditional approach when there are clear lines of
authority according to type of work. For example, all accountants might report to a
head of accounting, all marketers report to a head of marketing, and so on. An organi-
zational chart for a functional organization is shown in Exhibit 3.1. Note that everyone
in the organization reports up through one and only one supervisor. That supervisor is
the head of a discipline or function (such as marketing).
The functional manager generally controls the project budget, makes most project
decisions, and is the primary person who coordinates project communications outside
of the functional areas by contacting his or her peer functional managers.
ADVANTAGES One advantage of the functional form of organization is called unity of
command—all workers understand clearly what they need to do because only one “boss”
is giving them instructions. Another advantage is that since all workers in a discipline
report to the same supervisor, they can learn readily from each other and keep their
technical skills sharp. A third advantage is that workers know that when they finish
work on a project they will still have a job because they will continue to report to the
same functional manager. For small projects that require most of the work from one

Part 1 Organizing Projects

department, the functional organization often works well both because of the advantages
already stated and because the functional manager can share resources among various
small projects and centrally control the work.
DISADVANTAGES However, the functional form of organization can make for slow
communications when multiple functions need to have input. It also can be challeng-
ing from a technical standpoint if input is required from multiple disciplines. The
functional manager is probably quite good within his or her domain, but may have
less understanding of other disciplines. In small organizations where most people
have been forced to understand multiple areas, this may be less of an issue. Coordi-
nation between departments is frequently conducted at the manager level as the
functional managers have a great deal of decision-making authority. This often
means communication needs to first travel up from worker to manager, then across
from one functional manager to another manager, then down from manager to
worker. These long communication channels often make for slow decision making
and slow response to change. For these reasons, some organizations choose other
forms of organization.
3-1b Projectized
The exact opposite form of organization is the projectized organization, which is
defined as “any organizational structure in which the project manager has full authority
to assign priorities, apply resources, and direct work of persons assigned to the project.”2
In this organizational form, the larger organization is broken down into self-contained
units that support large projects, geographies, or customers. Most people in the organi-
zation are assigned to a project and report upward through the project manager, as can
be seen in Exhibit 3.2. While the structure of the two organizational charts appears
similar, the reporting manager is a project manager instead of a functional manager.
The project manager has extensive authority for budgets, personnel, and other decision
making in this organizational structure.

Chapter 3 Organizational Capability: Structure, Culture, and Roles
55

ADVANTAGES The advantages of the projectized organizational form are very different
from the advantages of the functional form. Because people from different functions now
report to the same project manager, traditional department barriers are reduced. Since
the project manager is responsible for communications, response times and decision
making tend to be swift. All workers understand clearly what they need to do because
only one “boss”—the project manager—is giving them instructions.
Projectized organizational structures often utilize the technique of co-location, which
is “an organizational placement strategy where the project team members are physically
located close to one another to improve communication, working relationships, and
productivity.”3 This co-location often results in enhanced project team identity, strong
customer focus, and effective integration of effort on the project.
DISADVANTAGES However, this organizational form also has disadvantages. Team
members are often assigned to just one project, even if the project only needs part of
their time. This can be costly. Since the project manager is in charge and the team may
be physically located onsite rather than with the rest of the organization, some projects
tend to develop their own work methods and disregard those of the parent organization.
While some of the new methods may be quite useful, project teams not watched closely
can fail to practice important organizational norms and sometimes do not pass the
lessons they learn on to other project teams. Team members who are co-located, while
learning more about the broader project issues, often do not keep up their discipline-
specific competence as well. Team members sometimes worry about what they will do
when the project is completed.
3-1c Matrix
Each of the extreme strategies already described (extreme in the sense that either the
functional manager or the project manager has a great deal of authority) has great
advantages, yet significant weaknesses. In an attempt to capture many of the advantages
of both, and to hopefully not have too many of the weaknesses of either, many organiza-
tions use an intermediate organizational strategy in which both the project manager and
the functional manager have some authority and share other authority.
This intermediate strategy is the matrix organization, which is “any organizational
structure in which the project manager shares responsibility with the functional man-
agers for assigning priorities and directing work of persons assigned to the project.”4
A matrix organization is shown in Exhibit 3.3. Note that project team members report
to both functional and project managers. This is a clear violation of the unity-
of-command principle; however, it is necessary to enjoy the benefits of a matrix organi-
zation. In short, the hoped-for benefit of a matrix structure is a combination of the task
focus of the projectized organizational structure with the technical capability of the
functional structure.
ADVANTAGES Matrix organizations have many advantages, which is why an increas-
ing number of companies are using some variation of them today. One advantage is
that because both project and functional managers are involved, there is good visibility
into who is working where, and resources can be shared between departments and pro-
jects. This reduces possible duplication—a major advantage in this age of lean thinking
in business. Since both types of managers are involved, cooperation between departments
can be quite good. There is more input, so decisions tend to be high quality and are
better accepted. This is a major issue since enthusiastic support for controversial
decisions often helps a project team work through challenges. Since people still report
to their functional manager, they are able to develop and retain discipline-specific
56
Part 1 Organizing Projects

knowledge. Since the various disciplines report to the same project manager, effective
integration is still possible. Because people report to both the project manager, who
is responsible for capturing lessons learned, and to the functional manager, who is
responsible for how the work in a function is performed, lessons learned can be shared
effectively between projects.
Yet another advantage of the matrix form is its flexibility. The amount of decision-
making authority can be shared equally in whatever manner is desired. When the
functional managers have relatively more power, it is almost like a functional organiza-
tion. This is how many organizations start evolving—by giving project managers a bit
more decision-making authority. This is called a weak matrix since the project managers
have less authority than the functional managers. The next step in the progression is a
balanced matrix in which project managers and functional managers have about equal
power. Finally, a strong matrix is one where the project managers have more power
than functional managers. This is more similar to a projectized organizational form.
The progression of forms is shown in Exhibit 3.4.
DISADVANTAGES
The matrix organizational form has drawbacks as well. Some
people claim that having two bosses (both a functional manager and a project manager)
is a disadvantage. This problem certainly needs to be managed because the two managers
may each try to do what they think is best for their project or department and may give

conflicting advice. However, this is common territory for most people. Most students
take multiple classes per term. Most companies have multiple customers. Having to bal-
ance competing demands can be difficult, but it is very normal for most people. Since
more people are providing the necessary input, there are more sources of conflict, more
meetings, and more challenges to control. Decisions may not get made as fast.
Firms need to consider which organizational structure is best for them in the sense
that they can capitalize on its advantages and mitigate its disadvantages. These decisions
can change over time. Exhibit 3.5 summarizes a comparison of organizational structures.
Note that in a matrix organization a new role is inserted in the organizational chart—that
of manager of project managers. Sometimes this person leads an office called the project
management office (PMO). In some organizations, an additional manager will be in the
reporting chain between the project managers and the person in charge (shown as the presi-
dent). In other matrix organizations, the project managers report directly to the person in
charge. For simplicity, this chart shows each function with four workers and each project
with four team members. In actuality, some functions may have more workers than others,
and some projects may have more team members than others. In fact, some people may
only report to a functional manager since they are not currently assigned to a project, and
others may report to more than one project manager since they are assigned on a part-time
basis to multiple projects. Those people will have more than two supervisors.
While both project managers and functional managers have certain authority in any
matrix organization, the extent of this authority can vary substantially. Often, the project
manager has authority to determine what work needs to be accomplished and by
when. The functional manager often retains authority to determine how the work is

accomplished. Sometimes, the two managers will negotiate to determine which workers
will be assigned to the project. While both hopefully want the best for the overall orga-
nization, each has specific responsibilities. For example, the functional manager with sev-
eral workers reporting to her wants each employee to have enough work but not be
overloaded. She also wants all workers to grow in expertise. The project manager, on
the other hand, wants the best workers for the project so she can be more assured of
delivering good results. In a case like this, when they negotiate, the project manager
may want the best resource (who is already busy) and the functional manager may offer
the least experienced resource (who is available).
One other source of potential conflict between the project and functional managers
deals with performance reviews. Often, the functional manager is tasked with writing
performance reviews, yet some workers may spend a great deal of their time on projects.
If the project managers are not allowed to provide input into the performance reviews,
some project team members will work harder to please their functional managers and
the projects can suffer. One project manager offers ideas regarding performance reviews
in Exhibit 3.6.
Closely related to the organizational structure is another organizational decision that
needs to be made—that of organizational culture. Project managers are not often part of
the executive group that decides on organizational structure or organizational culture,
but they certainly need to understand how these decisions impact reporting relation-
ships, decision-making methods, and commitment for their projects.
3-2 Organizational Culture and Its Impact on Projects
Just as project managers need to understand the structure of the parent organization,
they also need to understand the culture of the parent organization if they are to com-
municate effectively. Organizational culture is comprised of values, social rituals, and
symbols that are shared among members of the organization and are taught to new
members. “Values serve as a moral compass to guide us and provide a frame of reference
to set priorities and determine right or wrong”.5 Values are implemented through social
rituals such as meetings, training, and ceremonies along with symbols such as work
layout and dress code.6 Collectively these can informally:
•
Motivate the ethical actions and communications of managers and subordinates;
•
Determine how people are treated, controlled, and rewarded;
•
Establish how cooperation, competition, conflict, and decision making are handled; and
•
Encourage personal commitment to the organization and justification for its
behavior.7
EXHIBIT 3.6
360-DEGREE PERFORMANCE REVIEWS
In some organizations, the functional manager performs a 360-degree evaluation. This appraisal
style requires that the functional manager seek feedback from a representative sample of the staff
that have worked with that project team member to provide feedback on a 360-degree form. Being
appraised by your peers or team members on a given project is considered best practice because
they’ve observed the individual in action “in the trenches.” Many large organizations use this
appraisal technique, since in large and/or complex organizations some staff rarely see their direct
supervisor or manager, depending upon their function in that organization.

Chapter 3 Organizational Capability: Structure, Culture, and Roles

Once a project manager understands the culture of the parent organization, he can
determine how to best develop the culture within his project. Many projects are
completed cooperatively between two or more parent organizations, or one organization
(a contractor) will perform the project for the other organization (a client). Whenever
more than one parent organization is involved, the project manager needs to understand
the culture of each well enough to facilitate effective project communications and
decision making.
3-2a Culture of the Parent Organization
When a project manager studies the culture of the parent organization, she needs to ask
the following questions:
•
What is the orientation of the corporate culture in general?
•
What are the ascribed values?
•
How is the organization viewed by others in terms of living the values?
•
How does the organization like to communicate internally and externally?
•
How well does the organization support project management specifically?
TYPES OF POWER One framework that is helpful in understanding a corporate culture
distinguishes the following four types of culture according to what is the most powerful
motivator:
1. Power culture
2. Role culture
3. Task culture
4. Personal culture
Power cultures exist when the supervisor exerts a great deal of economic and political
power and everyone tries to please the boss. Those in formal authority control competi-
tion, conflict resolution, and communication.
Role cultures motivate everyone to understand and closely follow their appointed
roles. Reliable workers follow formal designations of responsibility with utmost respect
for regulations and laws.
In task cultures, it is more important to get the job done than to worry about who
does the work or who gets credit. Hallmarks of task cultures are skill-based assignments,
self-motivated workers, and more deference paid to knowledge than to formal authority.
In personal cultures, people show genuine interest in the needs of workers, consider
worker development as critical to the organization’s success, and display an attitude that
collaboration is satisfying and stimulating.8
Many organizations will have one dominant culture modified by at least one of the
other types. An astute person will look not only for what people say when trying to
understand the culture, but also actions, decisions, symbols, and stories that guide
behavior.
A variety of organizational culture characteristics make project success more
likely. These characteristics include appreciation for project management; collabora-
tion to meet organizational goals; engagement of stakeholders; desire to provide
value to customers; teamwork across cultures; integrity, trust, and transparency;
insistence
on
continual
learning;
and
provision

and
recognition.

imperatives, and core values. The CEO, John Hayden, will often pull his “One Pager” out
at meetings and expects everyone else to do likewise. In talk and in action, Midland tries
to live out the core values that comprise its organizational culture. Exhibit 3.7 shows
Midland’s culture.
3-2b Project Cultural Norms
While some of the project’s culture is dictated by that of the parent organization,
effective sponsors and project managers can do many things to promote a good
working cultural norms within the project. Many times, participants on a project
have not worked together previously and may even come from parts of the organi-
zation (or outside organizations) that have historically been rivals. The sponsor and
project manager need to understand organizational politics and work to develop
cooperation both within the core project team and among the various groups of
project stakeholders.
When the project sponsor and manager are determining how to create the project
culture, ethics should be an important consideration. One aspect of an ethical project
culture is to determine how people should act. Project sponsors and managers learn
that they need to act in the best interests of three constituencies: the project itself—
attempting to deliver what is promised; the project team—encouraging and developing
all team members; and the other project stakeholders—satisfying their needs and
wants. Ethical project managers make decisions so that one of the three constituencies
does not suffer unfairly when satisfying the other two. One list of behaviors adapted
from the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct tells project managers to
exhibit the following:
•
Responsibility—take ownership for decisions.
•
Respect—show high regard for ourselves, others, and resources.
•
Fairness—make decisions and act impartially.
•
Honesty—understand the truth and act in a truthful manner.9
The other aspect of an ethical culture is how people actually act. Every project has
difficult periods, and the measure of project ethics is how people act at those times.
The project manager needs to show courage both in personally making the right
decisions and in creating an atmosphere in which others are encouraged to make the
right decisions. An ethical project culture in which people know how to act and have
the courage to do so yields better ideas; when a spirit of mutual trust prevails, everyone
participates with their ideas and effective partnering relationships within and beyond
the project team.

3-3 Project Life Cycles
All projects go through a predictable pattern of activity, or project life cycle. Project
planning teams use project life cycle models because various types of projects have
differing demands. A research and development project may require a certain test to be
performed before management approves the expenditure of large amounts of cash, while
the manager of a quality improvement project may need to document how the work is
currently performed before it makes sense to experiment with a new method. The major
types of project life cycle models, while differing in details, have some things in common.
•
They all have definite starting and ending points.
•
They involve a series of phases that need to be completed and approved before
proceeding to the next phase.
•
The phases generally include at least one initiating, one planning, one closing, and
one or more executing phases.
•
The various life cycle models are all frequently adapted by the companies, where
they are used to better fit with the organizational culture and language.
We will now look at several models that represent the variety used in improvement,
research, construction, and agile projects. We introduce the agile approach to project
management immediately after its life cycle model. In the remainder of the book, we
will deal with the generic, plan-driven model that includes selecting and initiating, plan-
ning, executing, and closing and realizing benefits, as shown in Exhibit 3.8. We will post
an agile icon in the margin wherever we highlight how the agile or adaptive approach is
different.
3-3a Define-Measure-Analyze-lmprove-Control (DMAIC) Model
Many firms use projects to plan and manage quality and productivity improvement
efforts. Various models are used for these improvement efforts. While these models
appear to be somewhat different, they all strive to use facts to make logical decisions
and to ensure that the results are as desired. The Six Sigma approach to quality improve-
ment (a popular current approach explained in Chapter 11) uses the DMAIC model.
A simple version of this model is shown in Exhibit 3.9.
3-3b Research and Development (R&D) Project Life Cycle Model
Many organizations use project management techniques to organize, plan, and manage
research and development efforts. These can vary in length from as much as a decade for
taking a new pharmaceutical from idea to successful market introduction to as little as a
few weeks to reformat an existing food product and deliver it to a client. Some R&D
project models are complex and have many phases because of huge risks and demanding

oversight, yet some are much simpler. One simple R&D model adapted from defense
development projects is shown in Exhibit 3.10.
3-3c Construction Project Life Cycle Model
Just as in other project applications, since construction projects differ greatly in size and
complexity, a variety of project life cycle models are in use. A generic construction proj-
ect life cycle model is shown in Exhibit 3.11.
3-3d Agile Project Life Cycle Model
One type of model increasingly used in information systems and some other projects
allows for incremental plans and benefits. These approaches have been variously called
iterative, incremental, adaptive, or change-driven. While agile is the umbrella name,
some of the specific approaches are called SCRUM, XP, Crystal, EVO, phased delivery,

cycle models, they provide short bursts of planning and delivery of benefits in multiple
increments during project execution. A generic agile project life cycle model is shown
in Exhibit 3.12.
3-4 Agile Project Management
Traditional plan-driven project management works well in many situations, but if
the scope is hard to define early in the project and/or when much change is
expected, a change-driven or agile approach often works better. In many situations,
project managers find the most useful method takes good practice from both plan-
and change-driven approaches, just as the matrix form of organizing takes good
ideas from both functional and projectized organizations. In this section, we intro-
duce several basic ideas from agile. In subsequent chapters, we will explain them in
more detail.
At the start of an agile project, overall planning is at a high level, and the only part
that is planned in detail is the work that will be done soon. As people learn from the
early work, the next portion of the project is planned in detail. The majority of the proj-
ect work is conducted in iterations (sometimes called sprints) that are normally a set
length of time such as two or four weeks. The project team agrees to deliver something
of value at the end of each iteration. The fixed time and amount of committed resources
for each iteration dictate how big that deliverable will be, and the team agrees with the
customer how the deliverable will be considered complete and useful. Each iteration has
initial planning, a brief daily planning meeting, a demonstration of the value at the end
of the iteration, and a retrospective meeting at the end to learn and apply the learnings
to the next iteration. Documentation is minimal early in the project but becomes
progressively more complete. Within an iteration, change is rarely permitted, but it is
expected from one iteration to the next.
Sponsors, customers, project managers, and team members need to be actively
engaged. The sponsor and customer may be the same or two different people. The
customer prioritizes work from a business needs standpoint, making tradeoffs between
value, quality, and constraints. The project manager is sometimes called a scrum master
to emphasize the need to facilitate and remove obstacles rather than to command and
control. The team needs to be self-directed with high trust. All of the roles are more
collaborative than confrontational.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

3-5 Project Executive Roles
Projects do not exist in a vacuum. They exist in organizations where they require
resources and executive attention. Projects are the primary method that organizations
use to reach their strategic goals. As such, a variety of players need to be involved at
the executive, managerial, and associate levels, as shown in Exhibit 3.13. Especially in
small organizations, one person may perform more than one role. For example, a spon-
sor may perform some or all of the activities normally expected from the customer. The
four project executive roles are the steering team (ST), the sponsor, the customer, and
the chief projects officer (CPO).
3-5a Steering Team
In small to medium-sized organizations, the steering team (sometimes known as the
executive team, management team, leadership team, operating team, or other titles) often
consists of the top person in the organization and his or her direct reports. They
should collectively represent all of the major functions of the organization. In larger
organizations, there may be steering teams at more than one level. When that occurs,
the steering teams at lower levels are directed and constrained by decisions the top-
level steering team makes. Some organizations divide the duties of the steering team by
creating project review committees and delegating tasks to them. In any event, the duties
of the steering team revolve around the following five activities:
1. Overall priority setting
2. Project selection and prioritization
3. Sponsor selection
4. General guidance
5. Encouragement
The steering team generally sets overall organizational priorities with the CEO. This is
a normal part of strategic planning, as described in Chapter 2. Once the overall organi-
zational goals have been set, the steering team agrees on the criteria for selecting projects
and then selects the projects the organization plans to execute during the year. Once the
overall project list is complete, they determine the relative priorities of the projects to
determine which will start first.
Simultaneously, the steering team often helps the CEO decide who will sponsor
potential upcoming projects. In turn, the steering team often helps the sponsor select
the project leader. In some cases, the steering team even gets involved in deciding which
critical team members will be on the project. This is especially true if very few people in
the organization have highly demanded skills. The steering team can decide which
project these people will work on as part of the prioritizing effort.

Guidance from the steering team includes feedback during formal reviews as well as
informal suggestions at other times. Since steering teams understand how important project
success is in achieving organizational objectives, they normally demand to have formal
project reviews. These can occur either at set calendar times or at a project milestone, which
is “a significant point or event in the project.”10 At these formal reviews, the steering team
can tell the project team to continue as is, to redirect their efforts in a specific manner, or to
stop the project altogether.
In terms of informal suggestions, it is very empowering to project participants if the
steering team members ask how the project is going and offer encouragement when they
run into each other in the normal course of work. It shows project participants that their
work is important and has high visibility in the organization.
3-5b Sponsor
PMI defines a sponsor as “the person or group who provides resources and support for
the project and is accountable for enabling success for the project.”11 In this sense, the
sponsor is normally an individual who has a major stake in the project outcome. Spon-
sors often perform a variety of different tasks that help a project, both in public
and behind the scenes. Major sponsor responsibilities are shown by project stage in
Exhibit 3.14. The sponsor for major projects is often a member of the steering team.
On smaller projects, the sponsor may hold a lower position in the organization.
As a member of the steering team, the sponsor should understand the corporate strat-
egy and be prepared to help with project selection and prioritization. Sponsors should pick
the project manager and core team (sometimes with help from the project manager and/or
others). Sponsors should mentor the project manager to ensure that person understands
his role and has the skills, information, and desire to successfully manage the project.
In the next chapter, we discuss chartering. Sponsors ideally take an active role in
chartering the project by creating a first draft of the business case and scope overview
statements for the project. If a sponsor does not take time for this, the project manager
needs to ask questions to elicit this business case and scope overview information. Then
the sponsor should insist that a milestone schedule, preliminary budget, risk identifica-
tion, assessment criteria, communication plan, and lessons learned be developed by the
project manager and team. The sponsor then either personally approves the charter or
takes the charter to the steering team for approval.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

As the project progresses, the sponsor helps behind the scenes by obtaining resources,
removing roadblocks, making high-level decisions, and interfacing between the project core
team and the executive team. Sponsors often share their vision for the project with various
stakeholders. When providing staff, sponsors ensure they are adequate in number and skill.
This may include training. It may also include negotiating for staff. Sponsors often let their
project managers arrange this training and negotiate for resources. However, the sponsor
needs to make sure that both are satisfactorily completed.
Once again, sponsors with experienced project managers may merely need to ensure
their project managers have the means in place to monitor and control their projects.
Large projects with many stakeholders often have formal kickoff meetings. The sponsor’s
presence demonstrates corporate commitment. Sponsors represent the customer to the
project team. The sponsor must ensure that several important customer-related tasks
are performed as follows:
•
All customers (stakeholders) have been identified.
•
Their desires have been uncovered and prioritized.
•
The project delivers what the customers need.
•
The customers accept the project deliverables.
Again, the project manager should do much of this, but the sponsor is also responsi-
ble for its completion. While sponsors represent their projects, they also represent the
larger organization. As such, they often should be one of the first persons to determine
the need to stop a project that is no longer needed or is not performing adequately.
Finally, after the project results have been used for a period of time, the sponsor should
make sure the expected results have happened.
3-5c Customer
While the specific demands of the customer role are spelled out here, understand that
some or all of this role may be carried out by the sponsor—particularly for projects
internal to a company. When a busy customer buys something, it may be tempting to just
place an order and have it delivered. That process is fine for an off-the-shelf item or for
a transactional service. However, when it is a one-of-a-kind project, hands-off ordering
does not work. The question then becomes: What does a customer need to do to ensure
the desired results? Exhibit 3.15 shows a list of seven tasks a customer can do before and
during a project to enhance the probability of success. The customer performs three of
these tasks independently and the other four jointly with the project contractor. The
three customer-only project tasks are prioritizing the project need, carefully selecting a
good contractor, and killing the project if necessary. The four joint tasks are writing
and signing the project charter, developing clear and detailed requirements, setting up
and using project control systems, and conducting a great project kickoff meeting.

INDEPENDENT TASKS The first requirement is to prioritize each project. The knowl-
edge that one particular project is the highest priority for a company should be commu-
nicated, and that project should be tackled by the “A team.” A related prioritization
question is: Do we need this project so badly right now that we are willing to start it
even without the skilled personnel, resources, or technology on hand that would improve
the probability of successful completion? If so, ensure this particular project gets top
billing. If not, consider delaying it.
The second customer task is to carefully select a competent and honest contractor
to perform the project. All of the important joint tasks are much easier with the
right contractor, the probability of success goes up, and everyone’s stress level goes
down.
The third customer task is to determine whether to pull the plug on a troubled
project. This could happen right at the start if the project appears to be impractical. It
could happen during detailed planning when the requirements, schedule, budget, risks,
or other aspects indicate trouble. More often, it occurs during project execution when
the project progress does not live up to the plan. A customer needs to decide when to
stop throwing good money after bad.
JOINT TASKS WITH CONTRACTOR The
first
joint
task
for
customers
and
contractors is to create and ratify the project charter. The charter (as explained more
fully in Chapter 4) is a broad agreement concerning the project goals, rationale, risks,
timeline, budget, approach, and roles—even though all of the details have yet to be
determined. The charter should help to identify projects that appear risky or otherwise
impractical from the outset. These projects should either be scrapped, or a different
approach should be used. If the project looks promising, both the contractor and the
customer normally sign the charter and feel morally bound to its spirit.
Once the charter is signed, the contractor and customer need to develop detailed
requirements. Some of the challenges many customer companies face are differing proj-
ect expectations among the members of the organization. Somehow the conflicting
desires of multiple people in the customer’s organization must be combined into one
set of requirements that will be provided to the people who will perform the project
work. Senior customer representatives and project managers frequently work together
to determine the requirements.
The customer and the contractor often collaborate on the set up and use of several
project control systems. One of these is a communications plan (which is explained in
Chapter 5). Since the customer is often the recipient of communications, he needs to
tell the contractor what he needs to know, when he needs to know it, and what format
will be most convenient. This should include regular progress reports. Second is a change
control system (also explained in Chapter 5). Most projects will have multiple changes.
A method must be created to approve potential changes, document their impact, and
ensure that they are carried out as agreed. Third is a risk management system (explained
in Chapter 10). Customers should work with developers to brainstorm possible risks,
consider how likely each risk is to occur, measure a risk’s impact should it happen, and
develop contingency plans. The customer needs to ensure that effective communications,
change management, and risk management systems are used.
Customers must help plan and participate in a project kickoff meeting. This meeting
should be widely attended, give everyone involved in the project a chance to ask ques-
tions, and be used to build excitement for the project.
Customers get what they pay for on projects, but only when actively involved in key
activities. Customers have the sole responsibility of prioritizing their own needs, selecting
a contractor to perform their project, and terminating a project that is not working.
68
Part 1 Organizing Projects

Customers and contractors share the responsibility for crafting and agreeing to a project
charter, articulating requirements, developing and using project control systems, and
conducting an informative and energetic project kickoff.
In agile projects the customer (who may be the sponsor) is responsible for the return
on investment earned by the project; prioritizing scope; and accepting or rejecting
acceptance of deliverables at the end of each iteration.
3-5d Chief Projects Officer/Project Management Office
Organizations need to have one person who “owns” their project management system
and is responsible for all the people who work on projects. While different companies
use different titles for this position (such as project director or manager of project
managers), we will use the title chief projects officer (CPO). Just as companies’ size and
complexity vary greatly, so does the role of CPO. Large companies frequently have a
project management office (PMO). The PMO performs the CPO role. At small compa-
nies, the CPO role may be performed informally by the CEO, who also juggles many
other time demands. Companies in the medium-size range may find it useful to appoint
an executive who already has other responsibilities as the CPO. Ensuring projects are
planned and managed well is so central to the success of most companies that a highly
capable individual is normally assigned this responsibility.
So, what are the responsibilities of the chief projects officer? They include ensuring
that the company’s steering team:
•
Identifies potential projects during strategic planning
•
Selects a manageable set of projects to be implemented
•
Prioritizes effectively within that set
•
Ensures enough resources (people, money, and other resources) are available to
perform the projects
•
Selects appropriate project sponsors and teams
•
Charters the project teams
•
Monitors and controls the implementation of the projects
•
Rewards the participants
•
Enjoys the results of successful projects!
If that is not enough, the CPO also ensures that each individual serving on a project:
•
Receives the training he or she needs
•
Captures lessons learned from completed projects
•
Uses lessons learned from previous projects on new projects
•
Uses templates and standards when appropriate
3-6 Project Management Roles
The manager-level roles in projects include the functional manager, project manager,
scrum manager, and facilitator.
3-6a Functional Manager
Functional managers are often department heads. Projects come and go, but departments
generally remain. Functional managers have a large role in deciding how the project
work in their functional area is done. Functional managers and project managers may
negotiate who will be assigned to work on the project.
A G I L E
Chapter 3 Organizational Capability: Structure, Culture, and Roles
69

Generally, top management in an organization needs to decide how the relative
decision-making power in the organization is divided between project managers
and functional managers. Organizations that are new to formalized project mana-
gement often start with functional managers having more power. Often, this
changes over time until project managers for big projects have relatively more
power.
3-6b Project Manager
The project manager is the focal point of the project. He or she spends a large amount of
time communicating with everyone who is interested in the project. The project manager
leads the planning, execution, and closing of the project. This person ideally should be a
flexible, facilitating leader. Since project managers are responsible for the project sched-
ule, they have a large role in deciding when project activities need to be accomplished.
Project managers are trusted with delivering project results needed by their parent orga-
nizations. As such, project managers need to be worthy of that trust by possessing both
integrity and necessary skills.
DESIRED BEHAVIORS Exhibit 3.16 shows a few of the behaviors project managers can
develop first in regard to integrity and then in regard to each of the 10 project
management knowledge areas needed to successfully plan and manage projects. This
book describes some of the factual knowledge project managers need to acquire to
become proficient. Project managers also need to acquire experiential knowledge by
practicing these behaviors on projects. Not all project managers will become equally
adept at each behavior, but an understanding of the behaviors exhibited by excellent
project managers is a great way to start. Remaining chapters in this book elaborate on
these behaviors. Collectively, all of these skills make for a great, well-rounded project
manager.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS Envision a bicycle wheel, as shown in Exhibit 3.17.
The project manager is like the hub, and the spokes are like the many communication
channels the project manager needs to establish and use with project stakeholders. While
there are many project manager requirements, some of the technical needs can probably
be delegated, but every project manager needs integrity, leadership, and communications
skills.
CHALLENGES Project managers deal with several challenges. One is that they often
have more responsibility than authority. This means they need to persuade people to
accomplish some tasks rather than order them to do so. Project managers can create
interesting and challenging work assignments for their team members. Many people
find this stimulating. Project managers can more effectively attract followers when they
display high integrity and the ability to get the job done. This includes both technical
ability and communications ability. Project managers primarily deal with networks of
people both within and outside their parent company. An effective project manager
knows how to get to the source of the networks. A challenge for project managers is
determining how networks function within certain organizational cultures. This is why
organizational culture is so important. What are the networks within the organization?
How do people work, communicate, and problem solve beneath the function of their
job titles?

DESIRED PROJECT MANAGER BEHAVIORS
INTEGRITY:
A PM demonstrates integrity by making honest decisions, protecting people, defending
core values, leading major change, honoring trust, showing respect, establishing a culture of honesty,
and displaying total commitment to project and people.
INTEGRATION:
A PM is an effective integrator by leading the chartering process, coordinating
assembly of a detailed and unified project plan, balancing the needs of all stakeholders, making logical
tradeoff decisions, and keeping focus on primary objectives.
SCOPE:
A PM deftly handles project scope by obtaining a deep understanding of stakeholder wants
and needs, determining true requirements, learning if proposed changes are essential, stopping un-
necessary scope creep, and demonstrating needed flexibility.
TIME:
A PM is an effective scheduler by leading schedule development, understanding resource and
logic limitations, understanding the project life cycle, focusing on key milestones, and making schedule
decisions while being aware of cost and scope issues.
COST:
A PM maintains cost control by developing an accurate understanding of project scope,
determining reliable cost estimates, controlling all project costs, and calculating and honestly reporting
all variances in a timely and transparent manner.
QUALITY:
A PM achieves project quality by learning customer expectations and how they relate to
organizational objectives, insisting project decisions are based upon facts, utilizing lessons learned,
ensuring effective work processes are used, and leading testing.
HUMAN RESOURCES:
A PM effectively handles human resource issues by leading in a facilitating
manner when possible and forcefully when needed, attracting and retaining good workers, developing
a self-directed project team, and creating a sense of urgency.
COMMUNICATIONS:
A PM displays good communications by listening and speaking well,
advocating the project vision, maintaining enthusiasm, focusing attention on key issues, establishing
order, working through conflict, seeking support, and openly sharing.
RISK:
A PM effectively deals with project risk by openly identifying risks and opportunities,
honestly evaluating each, developing avoidance strategies when practical and mitigation strategies when
needed, and courageously recommending needed actions.
PROCUREMENT:
A PM effectively procures needed goods and services by accurately documenting
all requirements, identifying and fairly considering all potential sellers, proactively managing contracts
and relationships, and ensuring all deliveries.
STAKEHOLDER:
A PM deals effectively with stakeholders by robustly identifying all who are interested
in the project, asking probing questions to understand their desires, and ensuring someone on the project
team maintains effective relationships with each.

A rookie project sponsor and rookie project manager should not be assigned to the same
project. While the sponsor normally mentors the project manager, when a sponsor is new,
some of the mentoring may go the other way—just as a master sergeant may help a new
lieutenant learn about leading troops.
JUDGMENT CALLS Due to the very nature of projects—each one having a unique set
of stakeholders, output, and project team—project managers cannot always follow a
cookbook approach in how they manage. They must develop judgment. Exhibit 3.18
lists some judgment calls that project managers need to be prepared to make on a
frequent basis.
COMPETENCIES BY PROJECT STAGE Just as sponsor demands vary by project life
cycle stage, so do those of project managers, as shown in Exhibit 3.19.
3-6c Scrum Master
In agile projects, a new title is introduced—the scrum master. In effect, this is a
project manager who serves and leads in a collaborative, facilitating manner. This is
totally consistent with contemporary project management since many individuals do
much better work when they actively plan it rather than have it assigned to them.
The scrum master guides team members as they prioritize tasks and removes obsta-
cles to their progress. In this book we consider the scrum master to be the project
manager.
3-6d Facilitator
Some project management situations require facilitation because the situation is so com-
plex and/or because the opinions are so varied. Sometimes, the workers on a project
need to expand their thinking by considering the many possibilities (possible projects,
approaches, risks, personnel, and other issues). Other times, the workers on the project
need to focus their thinking by selecting from many options (a project, an approach, a
EXHIBIT 3.18
PROJECT MANAGER JUDGMENT CALLS
A few general questions project managers need to ask themselves is when to:
•
Act vs. analyze
•
Lead vs. follow
•
Lead vs. administer
•
Repeat vs. change
•
Change expectations vs. accept them
•
Take over vs. let the team perform
•
Focus on the big picture vs. focus on details
•
Focus on technical vs. focus on behavioral
•
Focus on short term vs. focus on long term
•
Promote order (control) vs. promote innovation (freedom)
•
Allow (constructive) conflict vs. discourage (destructive) conflict
•
Focus communications inside the project vs. focus communications outside
•
Demonstrate optimism vs. demonstrate pessimism
•
Advocate for the project vs. accept termination
•
Focus on project goals vs. organizational, personal, or team member goals
•
Enhance, maintain, or accept changes in scope, quality, cost, and schedule

contractor, or a mitigation strategy). Most project managers and sponsors can and do fa-
cilitate many meetings. However, the project manager may prefer to focus on the content
of a meeting and enlist a facilitator to help focus on the process of the meeting. In these
situations, an outside facilitator may be useful. Often, a disinterested sponsor or project
manager (one who works on other projects, but not on this one) is used when a facilitator
is needed. Sometimes, the chief projects officer or an outside consultant is used to facilitate.
3-7 Project Team Roles
The team- or associate-level roles in projects are core team members and subject matter
experts (SMEs).
3-7a Core Team Members
Core team members are the small group of people who are on the project from start to
finish and who jointly with the project manager make many decisions and carry out
many project activities. If the project work expands for a period of time, the core
team members may supervise the work of SMEs who are brought in on an as-needed
basis. Ideally, the core team is as small as practical. It collectively represents
and understands the entire range of project stakeholders and the technologies the proj-
ect will use. It is generally neither necessary nor useful to have every single function
represented on the core team, since that would make communication and scheduling
meetings more difficult. Also, if every function is represented directly, team members
tend to fight for turf.
The ideal type of core team member is one who is more concerned with completing
the project (on time, with good quality, and on budget if possible) than with either per-
sonal glory or with only doing work in his or her own discipline. He or she does what it
takes to get the project done.

Core teams on agile projects are ideally self-directed. They organize themselves and
exhibit significant maturity. They create their own estimates and report to each other
daily. The same members should be on the team for an entire iteration, although the team
can change from one iteration to the next. The members should be co-located and assigned
to the project full time for the duration of the iteration.
3-7b Subject Matter Experts
While core team members are typically assigned to the project from start to finish, many
projects also have a specific and temporary need for additional help. The necessary help
may be an expert who can help make a decision. It may be extra workers who are
needed at a busy time during the life of the project. Some extra help may be needed for
as little as one meeting; other extra help may be needed for weeks or months. These
extra helpers are often called subject matter experts (SMEs) since they are usually needed
for their specific expertise.
SMEs are brought in for meetings and for performing specific project activities when
necessary. A project could have almost any number of SMEs, depending on its size and
complexity.
SMEs are not on the core team but still are essential to the project. SMEs may be on a
project for a long time and thus be almost indistinguishable from core team members.
However, SMEs may spend only a little time on a particular project and, there-
fore, may not relate strongly to it. At times, it is a struggle to get them scheduled
and committed. Typically, a project manager would have a newly assigned SME
read the project charter and the minutes from the last couple of meetings before
discussing the project with him. It is a balancing act to ensure that the SME under-
stands what she needs to do and how important it is, without spending a great deal
of time in the process.
Summary
Projects are accomplished either within an organiza-
tion or between multiple organizations when differ-
ent firms work together. Project managers are more
effective if they understand the impact the organiza-
tion has on the project. In contemporary society,
different organizations choose different organiza-
tional structures because they feel there is an advan-
tage in their unique circumstances. While many are
Core team members understand all aspects of the project and stay with the project through completion.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

still officially organized in a traditional functional
manner, an increasing number of organizations
have at least informal matrix relationships. The
days of having only one boss are gone for many
workers—and especially for many project managers.
Each form of organization has strengths and chal-
lenges with respect to projects.
Organizations also have a culture—the formal and
informal manner in which people relate to each other
and decisions are made. The hierarchical approach
with the boss having supreme authority has long van-
ished in many places. Many organizations today use a
more collaborative approach—some much more than
others. Whatever the approach, project managers
need to understand it and the impact it creates on their
project. Project managers and sponsors need to create a
culture in their project that is consistent with, or at
least can work effectively with, that of the parent orga-
nization. Both organizational structure and culture can
become more complicated if more than one organiza-
tion is involved in the project and if they differ in these
respects.
Projects follow a predictable pattern or project life
cycle. Many industries have typical project life cycles,
but they vary greatly. A project manager needs to at
least understand what project life cycle model is used
at her organization and often needs to select or modify
the project life cycle to the specific demands of the
project.
Multiple executive-, managerial-, and associate-level
roles need to be performed in projects. The project
manager is a central role and the subject of this book.
Project managers need to understand the other roles
and relate effectively to them.

Chartering Projects
Planning a project is similar to putting together a large puzzle. If you were to
dump a 1000-piece puzzle on a table, you would probably not start the
detailed “planning” right away by comparing two pieces randomly to see if
they fit. You would likely take several preliminary steps. Some of these steps
might include turning the pieces so the picture side was visible on each,
sorting outside pieces so you could form the boundaries, studying the
picture on the box, and sorting by color so you could match pieces more
easily. These preliminary steps make the detailed planning of the puzzle
much easier and more efficient. If completing projects is analogous to
putting puzzles together, then project charters are the initial steps. Initiating a
project requires some preliminary actions, including understanding the needs
and concerns of stakeholders, most critically the project sponsor.

and thinking about things up front; with an agreed-upon charter, this gives the
project team some guidance to effectively plan and execute the effort. In
addition, by going through the chartering process, stakeholders take ownership
in the project.
At Ball, our project sponsors are typically U.S. government customers, and
we provide work for them on a contractual basis. They provide funding and
broad direction for our efforts, and we go through a formal proposal process for
all our projects. Project sponsors provide initial statements of work or objectives
defining their goals for the task and then select among several proposals from
interested companies such as Ball to fulfill their requirements. The chosen
company is then under an official formal contract to complete the project. This
is in effect a pre-chartering process.
Typically, after an effort is under contract, a kickoff meeting is scheduled
to review the objectives of the project between the project sponsor and the
chosen company. This is part of the initiating stage, where stakeholders
review and approve the following as part of the project’s charter:
•
Overall project objectives
•
Contrast between technical approach as written in the company’s
proposal for execution and sponsor expectations
•
Milestones, checkpoints, and potential payment plans
•
Success criteria and schedule
•
Identification of key stakeholders and risks
•
Processes for executing, monitoring, controlling, and overall manage-
ment of the project
There are a number of things to consider when initiating a project and
generating a project charter. These serve as pieces of the overall puzzle of
managing and executing a project. A little pre-work in initiating the project
goes a long way, with increased goodwill and understanding from the
project sponsor, clear tasks and goals for the project team, and a single way
forward towards achieving the products and services of the project.
This chapter describes what a project sponsor, manager, and team need
to understand to quickly initiate a project. The project then proceeds into
planning, and the elements of a charter are planned in as much detail as
needed. Chapters 5 through 11 describe project planning.

4-1 What Is a Project Charter?
For a project manager, team member, or project sponsor, one of the first and most
important project management concerns is a project charter. This short document
(usually about three pages) serves as an informal contract between the project team
and the sponsor (who represents both senior management of the organization and the
outside customer, if there is one). Since a charter is like a contract, it is helpful to
remember what a contract is. First, it is an agreement entered into freely by two or
more parties. Second, one party cannot arbitrarily change it. Third, there is something
of value in it for each party. Finally, it is a living document that can evolve with changing
conditions if both parties agree and receive something of value for making the change.
The charter signing represents the transition from the high-level project initiation stage
into the more detailed project planning stage. See Exhibit 4.1 for a review of the project
life cycle.
The project charter is the deliverable that grants a project team (that is, the project
manager and the core team) the right to continue into the more detailed planning stage
of a project. This may include only permission to plan the project, permission to make
decisions that would slow the project if delayed (such as ordering long-lead materials or
hiring special workers), or permission to plan and perform the entire project in the case
of a small, simple project. While either party (the sponsor or the project team) can write
the rough draft, more often than not the team writes the draft charter. Ideally, then, the
project team and the sponsor candidly discuss each part of the charter. Like a contract,
the people who sign a charter are wise to ensure that they understand and agree to all of
it. Unlike a contract, however, both parties feel obligated to the spirit (as opposed to the
letter) of the charter since the project details have not yet been worked out and specifics
will certainly change.
Thinking of a charter like a contract means that both the team and the sponsor
sign the charter willingly and strive to make the project successful. If the team feels
bullied into making a change, it is not a free choice. However, the sponsor may legit-
imately need to insist on receiving the project results more quickly or make some
other change to the project. In the spirit that one party cannot arbitrarily change a
contract, the sponsor would not just tell the project team, “I need the project a month
sooner and you get no more resources and no relief from any other work
responsibilities.” Rather, if the project must change, the sponsor needs to consider
herself or himself to be a partner with the project team in determining how to
accomplish the change.

4-2 Why Is a Project Charter Used?
The four major purposes for a charter are to:
1. Authorize the project manager to proceed
2. Help the project team and sponsor develop a common understanding
3. Help the project team and sponsor commit
4. Quickly screen out obviously poor projects
First, a project charter “formally authorizes the project… provides the project man-
ager with authority and documents the business and customer’s needs… the new prod-
uct, service, or result is intended to satisfy.”1 Many project managers do not have the
authority to commit resources without a charter. This gives the project and the project
manager official status within the parent organization.
Second, everyone involved in the upcoming project needs to develop a common un-
derstanding of what the project entails. This includes at least the broad justification for
the project, including how it aligns with goals of the parent organization, determination
of what is included and excluded, rough schedule, success measures, major risks, rough
estimate of resource needs, and stakeholders. On larger and more complex projects, ad-
ditional understanding may be required at this point. Once everyone has a common un-
derstanding of clear project goals, several additional benefits occur:
•
Teamwork develops.
•
Agreement, trust, communication, and commitment between the sponsor, project
manager, and project team develop.
•
The project team does not worry if management will accept a decision.
•
The sponsor is less likely to unilaterally change the original agreement.2
Third, each person needs to personally and formally commit to doing their level best
to achieve the agreed-upon project results—even when things do not go as planned. It is
a moral duty of project team members to commit to the shared goals articulated in the
charter. This formal commitment often helps a person decide to keep working hard on a
project when things are not going well.
Fourth, a charter is used to quickly screen potential projects to determine which
appear to be poor choices. A charter is much quicker to put together than a full, detailed
project plan and schedule. If by constructing a charter it is determined that the project is
likely to fail, much planning time (and therefore money) will be saved.
Remember, the charter helps all project stakeholders. Charters are often publicly
shown to many individuals beyond the project team and sponsor for communication.
The culture of some companies is more trusting, competitive, focused on time, preoccu-
pied with details, and so on than at other companies. Therefore, charters used in differ-
ent industries and companies have somewhat different elements and formats.
4-3 When Is a Charter Needed?
Project methods can be scaled from very simple to very detailed. A project manager
wants to use just enough detail. TriHealth has developed both full and mini charters,
for large and small projects respectively. They have also developed the decision matrix
shown in Exhibit 4.2 to help people determine if a full charter, mini charter, or no char-
ter is needed.

When an improvement, change, or new program is going to be implemented, it is important to first determine whether or not it
is a project. If it is a project, TriHealth has specific tools that should be used to guide the planning and implementation.
In general, a project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.” If your project impacts
more than one department, requires expertise or resources beyond your own department, or could affect the operations in
another area, the standardized templates should be used. Answering the questions below with a check will help you determine

4-4 Typical Elements in a Project Charter
The following sections list some of the typical key elements in a project charter. While
the intent of most of these sections is included in many charters, some project teams
combine sections or leave out one or two of them. Furthermore, while the term charter
is a widely used standard, some organizations use other names such as project request,
project submission form, or project preplanning form. As long as the four purposes of a
charter (authorization, understanding, commitment, and screening) are accomplished,
the exact format and title are negotiable. Typical charter elements and the question
each answers are shown in Exhibit 4.3.
The charter should be short enough so that the project team and sponsor (and any
other interested stakeholder) can examine it carefully to ensure they understand and
agree. Two to four pages in total is generally about the right length.
4-4a Title
The existence of a meaningful project title is critical. In an organization with a number
of projects, the title can be used to quickly identify which project is being referenced.
4-4b Scope Overview
The scope overview and business case sections are the high-level “what and why” of the
project. They are sometimes considered to be the “elevator speech” that a person would
use if given a very short amount of time, such as a one-floor elevator ride, to describe
their project. Sometimes an additional background statement is helpful.
The scope overview is the project in a nutshell: a high-level description of what needs
to be accomplished and how it will be done. What needs to be accomplished can be
described as the product scope, the “features and functions that characterize a product,

service or result,”3 or as requirements, each of which is a “condition or capability that is
required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a contract or other for-
mally imposed specification.”4 How it will be done is the project scope, “work that must
be performed to deliver a product, service, or result.”5 The scope overview quickly
describes the project work and results. The scope overview is used to distinguish between
what the project will and will not do. It is used to help prevent scope creep, which is
“uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost,
and resources.”6 The scope overview can be considered to be the project boundaries. It
states what is included and what is not—at least at a fairly high level.
Quantifying the scope, such as “15 touch points will be included,” helps everyone to
better understand the project’s size. If a project could be compared to an animal, the
scope overview briefly describes both the size and features so one can tell if it is a rabbit
or an elephant. By understanding what is included and what is not, the project team is
more likely to accurately estimate cost, resource, and schedule needs and to understand
and handle project risks.
4-4c Business Case
The business case is the project purpose or justification statement. It answers the ques-
tion “why?” and helps all parties understand the purpose of the project. A business case
is used to justify the necessity of the project. It should clearly tie the project to the orga-
nization’s strategy and explain the benefits the organization hopes to achieve by autho-
rizing the project. Depending on the organization, a business case can either be just the
rationale for the project, or it can also include high-level estimates of the costs and ben-
efits of the project. A business case may also include emotional and/or ethical reasons for
performing the project. A well-written business case should persuade decision makers to
support the project and inspire team members to work hard on it.
4-4d Background
Many people are quite busy and prefer short statements that can be quickly read. Some
project stakeholders will know enough about the project that short scope overview and
business case statements will provide all of the information they need. Some other stake-
holders may need more detail to understand the background behind these statements. A
more detailed background statement may be helpful in these cases. Unlike the first two
statements, which should be limited to about two to four sentences each, the background
statement can be any length. The background statement is purely optional—only develop
one if necessary.
4-4e Milestone Schedule with Acceptance Criteria
The milestone schedule is “a summary-level schedule that identifies the major schedule
milestones or significant points or events in the project.”7 It divides the project into a
few (about three to eight) intermediate points or milestones whose completion can be
verified. The team estimates a date when they expect to complete each milestone. A
milestone schedule should list major milestones and deliverables that the project team
especially wants to ensure are completed both on time and to the satisfaction of key de-
cision makers.
A deliverable is “any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a ser-
vice that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.”8 Sometimes,
milestones occur right before the approval of a large expenditure. At other times, they occur
at completion of a critical design. It is helpful to identify the relatively few milestones and
key deliverables in the project that the team and sponsor wish to check closely.
88
Part 1 Organizing Projects

Adding a column for acceptance criteria factors to the milestone schedule helps the project
team understand who will judge the quality of the deliverable associated with each milestone
and what criteria will be used for that determination. Acceptance criteria are “standards,
rules, or tests… by which a product, service, result, or process can be evaluated.”9
Acceptance criteria are like the project’s vital signs. A paramedic would check pulse,
breathing, maybe skin color, and body temperature immediately when answering a 911 call.
Other tests are not as critical and may be performed, just not immediately. It is important to
identify the vital signs for the project. Project success is easy to measure after the project is
complete. The equally important, but often more challenging, decision is how to measure it
while the project is progressing so there is still time to make changes if necessary.
Another way to understand acceptance criteria is to understand how a key stakeholder
such as the sponsor or customer is going to determine if the deliverables created are of
good enough quality to accept. Since some of the milestones are often preliminary (drafts,
prototypes, concepts, outlines, etc.), it is helpful to have the same person who will judge
the final project deliverables judge them at the intermediate milestones. By doing this, the
decision maker is much less likely to state at the end of the project, “No, that is not what I
meant.” Including advance understanding of criteria is similar to the old saying that a trial
lawyer never asks a question without knowing how the witness will answer. An astute proj-
ect manager never turns in a deliverable without knowing how it will be judged.
One key concept in agile projects is that something of value will be delivered at each
iteration. An agreement is reached during iteration planning on the “definition of
done”—meaning exactly how each feature and function must perform. This is compara-
ble to deliverables with acceptance criteria for each milestone as just described.
4-4f Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints
A risk is “an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative
effect on one or more project objectives.”10 Assumptions are “factors in the planning
purposes,
that
are
considered
to
be
true,
real,
or
certain
without
proof
or
demonstration.”11 Project teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions
as part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk. A
constraint is “a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project.”12
Taken together, risks, assumptions, and constraints are what could cause a project
problems. They are included so that all of the key participants—sponsor, project manager,
and core team—are aware in advance of what could prevent them from successfully com-
pleting the project. While it is unrealistic to believe that the team can think of every single
thing that could go wrong, the more comprehensive this section is, the more likely the team
is to uncover problems before they occur while there is time to easily deal with them.
If an assumption turns out to be false, it becomes a risk. A constraint that limits the
amount of money, time, or resources needed to successfully complete a project is also a
risk. Some organizations group all risks, assumptions, and constraints together, while
others handle each as a separate charter section. The most important point is not how
each is handled, but that each is handled.
Project managers and teams should look at risks for three reasons. First, any negative
risk that is a threat that may inhibit successful project completion (to the satisfaction of
stakeholders, on time, and on budget) needs to be identified. and, if it is a major risk,
a plan must be developed to overcome it. Second, a positive risk is an opportunity to
complete the project better, faster, and/or at lower cost or to capitalize upon the project
in additional ways, and a plan should be developed to capitalize upon it. Third, some-
times there is more risk to the organization if the project is not undertaken—and this
provides additional rationale for doing the project.
A G I L E
Chapter 4 Chartering Projects
89

For each major negative risk identified, an “owner” is assigned responsibility. Then
one or more response plans are normally developed to either lessen the probability of
the risk event from happening in the first place and/or to reduce the impact if the risk
event should materialize. The goal is not to eliminate all risk, but to reduce the risk to a
level that decision makers deem acceptable.
4-4g Resource Estimates
Resources are “skilled human resources, equipment, services, supplies … or funds.”13
Since executives consider projects to be investments of resources, they will want a rough
estimate. This can be an estimate of the amount of staff time, equipment, or materials
that are in short supply, and/or the amount of money that is required. Since there is
only very general understanding of the project at this point, any budget will also be ap-
proximate and should be stated as such by calling it a preliminary budget and including
the level of confidence one has in the estimate. This could be expressed in percentage
terms (such as plus or minus 50 percent).
On some internal projects, the pay for the associates who work on the project often
comprises much of the expense. Frequently, however, at least a few expenses are
incurred. It is helpful to identify which expenses the project manager can authorize and
which the sponsor needs to control.
4-4h Stakeholder List
Project success is partially dictated by identifying and prioritizing stakeholders, man-
aging robust relationships with them, and making decisions that satisfy stakeholder
objectives. Therefore it is good practice to identify and prioritize stakeholders early in a
project.
4-4i Team Operating Principles
Team operating rules or principles are sometimes established to enhance team function-
ing. The goal is to increase team effectiveness and ensure that all parties are aware of
what is expected. Team operating principles that are especially useful are those that
deal with conducting meetings, making decisions, accomplishing work, and treating
each other with respect.
The key players of a project show their commitment to the project by signing the commitment section of the
charter.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

4-4j Lessons Learned
While every project is unique, a great deal can be learned from the successes and failures
of previous projects and turned into practical advice. Lessons learned are “the knowl-
edge gained during a project which shows how project events were addressed or should
be addressed in the future with the purpose of improving performance.”14 To ensure that
lessons learned are used, a sponsor should only sign a charter authorizing the project to
begin when at least one or two good, specific lessons from the successes and/or failures
of recently completed projects are included. This essentially forces the new project man-
ager and team to look at the organization’s lessons learned knowledge base to find appli-
cable learnings. A lessons learned knowledge base is “a store of historical information
and lessons learned about both the outcomes of previous project selection decisions and
previous project performance.”15 These lessons could be stored in a dedicated database,
on a shared drive, or in a less formal manner. It is important for new project teams to
learn together; otherwise, they risk repeating mistakes from previous projects.
4-4k Signatures and Commitment
The commitment section of the charter lists who is involved and sometimes describes the
extent to which each person can make decisions and/or the expected time commitment for
each person. This is where the project sponsor, project manager, and core team members
publicly and personally show their commitment to the project by signing the charter. By
formally committing to the project, the key players are more likely to keep working hard
during difficult periods and see the project through to a successful conclusion.
4-5 Constructing a Project Charter
It is wonderful if the sponsor can work with the team in constructing the charter. The
sponsor, however, as a busy executive, often does not have time to be present for the
entire chartering period. In that case, it is very helpful if the sponsor can create the first
draft—however crude—of the scope overview and business case. A sponsor’s ability to
tell the project manager and core team concisely what the project is and why it is impor-
tant gets the team off to a good start. If the sponsor wants the team to consider any
important constraints, assumptions, risks, or other factors, she can help the team by
pointing that out up front.
Sometimes, on an especially important project, the organization’s leadership team
may draft more than just the business case and scope overview statements. If the leader-
ship team feels something is very important, they can save everyone time by just stating
it up front. Likewise, if the sponsor knows he or she will only approve a charter with one
of the elements written a particular way, he or she should tell the team that up front.
Otherwise, the team most frequently writes much of the rough draft themselves.
4-5a Scope Overview and Business Case Instructions
When possible, the first draft of these two sections should be provided by the sponsor or
the leadership team. One to four sentences for each is enough—but it needs to be in
writing. Many teams find that, because these are the “what and why” of the project, it
is easier to work on them at the same time. Teams often brainstorm key ideas and then
craft the parts they agree upon into smooth-flowing statements. If the sponsor provides
a first draft of these sections, the project manager and core team carefully dissect it
to ensure they both understand and agree. The project manager and team frequently
propose refinements on the original draft.
Scope overview and business case examples are depicted in Exhibit 4.4.
Chapter 4 Chartering Projects
91

4-5b Background Instructions
The project manager and team decide whether this optional section is necessary for their
project as they construct the scope overview and business case. If the scope overview and
business case seem detailed enough for all important stakeholders, an extra background
section may not be needed. If necessary, the team probably brainstorms ideas and then
combines them into a single smooth statement. An example of a background statement
for a project to start a new co-op business is shown in Exhibit 4.5.

PHASE II MULTI-CENTER TRIAL SCOPE OVERVIEW
This project will initiate a Phase II multi-center clinical trial at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The
trial will be conducted at five medical centers in the United States to investigate the safety and efficacy of an investigational drug’s
ability to improve cognitive functioning and quality of life in pediatric patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. The project is a
follow-up study of a Phase I clinical trial conducted at CCHMC.
ONLINE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROJECT SCOPE OVERVIEW
This project will design, develop, and implement an online tuition reimbursement system that will provide employees with a self-
service tool to submit a request for tuition reimbursement payment. This project will incorporate a workflow process that will:
Move the request to the appropriate personnel for approval,
Alert the employee of any additional items necessary for processing the request,
Upon approval, send the request to payroll for final processing, and
Notify the employee of payment processing.
DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH SPECIMEN SHIPPING CENTER PROJECT BUSINESS CASE
The purpose of this shipping center is to provide professional shipping services and supplies for CCHMC employees who are
responsible for shipping biological specimens as part of research. This shipping center will improve compliance, streamline ship-
ping processes, enhance research productivity, reduce time and money invested in employee training, and reduce potential liabil-
ity for noncompliance.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

information so it is simple to understand is to set up a four-column table with Milestone,
Completion Date, Stakeholder Judge, and Acceptance Criteria heading the columns. An
example of a milestone schedule with acceptance criteria for a project converting to a
centralized electronic record system for a major research hospital is shown in Exhibit 4.6.
SIX STEPS IN CONSTRUCTING A MILESTONE SCHEDULE The most effective way to
construct the milestone schedule with acceptance criteria is to use the six-step procedure
described below. Identifying the end points first (steps 1 and 2) helps project teams avoid
the problem of sinking into too much detail too quickly. Note that dates are the final
item to be identified. It is unethical for a project manager to agree to unrealistic dates.
Even though the milestone schedule is not very detailed, it is the first time a team thinks
through how the project will be performed and how long it will take at each point. This
allows a bit of realism in the schedule.
Step 1 The first task is to briefly describe (in three or four words) the current situation that
requires the project and place this description in the first row of the milestone column. The cur-
rent state may be a shortened version of the business case. Keep it very short, and it will form an
effective starting place. In Exhibit 4.6, the problem was paper records that were not centralized.
Step 2 Once the current state is agreed upon by the project manager and team, skip
to the desired future state. Describe the project (or phase if there will be future phases) at
its successful completion in three or four words. Put this description in the last row of
the milestone column. It is hard for many core teams to distill this to the ideal three or
four words, but keeping it concise helps the team develop a better understanding of what
is truly most important. If the current project is a phase of a larger project, also write
briefly what the final successful result of the last future stage will be. In Exhibit 4.6, the
desired future state is to have records centralized and available in electronic form, and
the ultimate goal is for seamless information flow throughout the organization. More
work will need to be completed beyond this project to reach that ultimate goal.
Step 3 Next, describe the acceptance criteria for the final project deliverables (at the
future state). What stakeholder(s) will judge the deliverables, and on what basis? Exactly
how will they become confident that the project results will work as desired? These sta-
keholders will almost always demand a demonstration of project results. The project
team wants to understand what that demonstration will be at this early point so they
can plan to achieve it. Note that there very well could be multiple stakeholders and mul-
tiple methods of ensuring the project results are satisfactory. At this point, strive to iden-
tify the most important stakeholders and acceptance criteria. Place these in the bottom
row of the third and fourth columns. In Exhibit 4.6, the sponsor wants a representative
from each department to show they can enter and retrieve pertinent data.

BACKGROUND SECTION EXAMPLE
Interfaith Business Builders is an organization of diverse Cincinnatians that develops and promotes
community-based, employee-owned and -operated cooperative businesses (co-ops). Our co-ops create
new jobs and ownership opportunities for low-income people in sustainable local businesses. Members of
IBB come from a variety of faith and social backgrounds, share a passion for social justice and the empow-
erment of people, and value community, cooperation, opportunity and solidarity. Our cooperatives are
businesses that follow these seven principles: voluntary and open membership; democratic member control;
members’ economic participation; autonomy and independence; education, training and information;
cooperation among cooperatives; and concern for community.

Step 4 Now, go back to the milestone column. Determine the few key points where qual-
ity needs to be verified. On most small to medium-sized projects, approximately three to
eight intermediate points are satisfactory. Start by identifying the three most important
intermediate points, and add more if necessary. If you need to identify considerably more
major deliverables at this point, you might consider splitting your project into phases and
concentrate on the first phase for now. Satisfactory completion of each milestone will be
determined by how the sponsor and other stakeholders will judge your performance. They
should be in enough detail so stakeholders are comfortable with your progress, yet not so
detailed that you feel micromanaged. The project in Exhibit 4.6 has four milestones.
On agile projects the first iteration is planned as a milestone with acceptance criteria
just as described above. However, subsequent milestones and acceptance criteria are
determined on a just-in-time (JIT) basis.
Step 5 Now for each milestone, determine who the primary stakeholder(s) is and how
he or she will judge the resulting deliverable. Remember, these are intermediate deliver-
ables, and often it is not as easy to determine desired performance. One idea to keep in
mind—if practical, ask the person who will judge the overall project results at the end to
judge the intermediate deliverables also to make sure you are on the right track. Quite a
few different stakeholders will judge various milestones in the project in Exhibit 4.6.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

Step 6 Finally, determine expected completion dates for each milestone. Do not be
overly optimistic or pessimistic. You will be at approximately the right level of detail if
you have a milestone somewhere between every one and six weeks on many projects.
Obviously, there will be exceptions for especially large or small projects. Most of the
milestones in the project in Exhibit 4.6 are about six weeks apart.
Some companies that perform many projects use templates to guide their project
teams through chartering and other activities. An example of a template for the mile-
stone schedule and acceptance criteria for a Six Sigma project is shown in Exhibit 4.7.
4-5d Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints Instructions
First, the project manager and team (and sponsor if the sponsor is available) together should
brainstorm all the things that could pose a risk to the project schedule, budget, usefulness of
any project deliverables, or satisfaction of any project stakeholder. Constraints that limit
choices and unproven assumptions can be identified. Assumptions are especially important
when a cross-functional team is performing the project because some team members may
make vastly different assumptions based upon the manner in which work is normally
accomplished in their respective departments. The brainstorming often works very well
with each team member writing one risk, constraint, or assumption per Post-it Note. On
large, complicated projects, risks, assumptions, and constraints may form separate sections
of a charter. However, in this book, we deal with them together. From this point forward, all
risks, assumptions, and constraints are simply referred to as risks.
Either the project manager or one of the team members can then act as a facilitator
and assess one risk at a time. Risks can be assessed on probability of occurring and
impact if realized. Both dimensions can be shown with a simple continuum of low to
high using a flip chart or marker board. The team can agree to assess each risk at any
point on the continuum. It works best if one dimension is considered at a time. For
example, first ask how likely the risk event is to occur. Only after this is answered, ask
how big the impact will be if it happens.

After all risks are assessed, the team needs to decide which of the risks should be con-
sidered major risks. That is, which are important enough to require a formal response
plan with someone assigned responsibility? The other, more minor risks are not formally
considered further in the charter, but very well may get more attention in the planning
and executing stages. The project team constructs a table depicting each major risk, with
its contingency plan and “owner.”
Examples of risk assessment and major risk response planning for a hardware
upgrade project in an Irish factory are shown in Exhibits 4.8 and 4.9, respectively.
4-5e Resources Needed Instructions
Armed with the milestone schedule, the project manager and team may be prepared to
make crude estimates of the project budget and other resource needs—such as people,
equipment, or space. It is imperative to describe how the estimates were developed and
the level of confidence the team has in them, such as “this is a rough order of magnitude
estimate only based upon the milestones, and the true project cost could range from

25 percent below this to 75 percent above it.” On many projects, especially those with
customers internal to the organization, a budget is not established. However, a limit of
spending authority for the project manager is often developed. An example of resources
needed for a project is shown in Exhibit 4.10.
This project is expected to take three months. During that time, estimated resources
needed include money, people, and space as shown below.
4-5f Stakeholder List Instructions
Stakeholders are all the people who have an interest in a project. They can be internal or
external to the organization, be for or against the project, and have an interest in the
project process and/or the project results. The project manager and team begin by iden-
tifying all stakeholders and determining which are most important. They next ask what
interest each stakeholder has in the project. A stakeholder list example for a clinical
research project is shown in Exhibit 4.11.
4-5g Team Operating Principles Instructions
The project manager and team will decide what project team operating principles they
will use. The operating principles establish how meetings will be conducted, how deci-
sions will be made, how work will get done, and how everyone will treat each other
with respect. Exhibit 4.12 is an example of team operating principles.

4-5h Lessons Learned Instructions
Each project by definition is at least somewhat different from any other project. That
said, there are many commonalities in how projects can be planned and managed. A
project manager and team need to consider what has worked well and what has worked
poorly on previous projects when starting a new one. A sponsor is wise not to sign a
project charter authorizing work until the project manager and team show they have
learned lessons from recently completed projects. One easy way to accomplish this is to
have each project report lessons learned at key reviews and at project completion and to
have the lessons available to all in a lessons learned knowledge base. The project man-
ager and team can then look at the lessons until they find at least a couple that can help
them on their project. These lessons are included in the charter. The more specific the
lessons, the more likely the team will find them useful. Exhibit 4.13 is an example of
project lessons learned.
4-5i Signatures and Commitment Instructions
The project sponsor, manager, and team members sign the charter to publicly acknowl-
edge their commitment. Sometimes other key stakeholders also sign. An example of a
charter signature section is shown in Exhibit 4.14.
EXHIBIT 4.12
TEAM OPERATING PRINCIPLES EXAMPLE
ABC Project Team Operating Principles
1.    Team members will be prepared with minutes from previous meeting, agenda,
and project updates. 
2.    Meetings will normally last for up to 90 minutes. 
3.    Team members will rotate the role of recorder. 
4.    Each team member will be responsible for setting his or her own deadline. 
5.    In the event that a team member cannot have his or her assignment complete by
the expected date, he or she must notify the team leader prior to the due date. 
6.    The team leader will be responsible for drafting the minutes from the previous 
meeting and the agenda for the next meeting within 48 hours.   
7.   Decisions will be made by: 
Team leader on ____ issues. 
Consensus on ____ issues. 
Delegation on ____ issues.
EXHIBIT 4.13
PROJECT LESSONS LEARNED EXAMPLE
All parties are responsible for defining and following the project scope to avoid scope creep.
All parties should share good and bad previous experiences.
Aligning team roles to sponsor expectations is critical.
Keep sponsor informed so sponsor stays committed.
Identify any possible changes as soon as possible.
Use weekly updates on project progress to avoid unpleasant schedule surprises.
Review previous events for specific lessons.
98
Part 1 Organizing Projects

4-6 Ratifying the Project Charter
The project manager and team formally present the project charter to the sponsor for
approval. In some organizations, the leadership team is also present for this meeting.
The sponsor (and leadership team members if present) ideally are supportive, but also
ready to ask questions regarding any part of the charter. These questions are for both
clarification and agreement. Once all questions are satisfactorily answered—including
any agreements regarding changes—the sponsor, project manager, and core team all
sign the project charter and feel bound by it.
4-7 Starting a Project using Microsoft Project
A useful tool to capture and conveniently display a variety of important project data is
Microsoft (MS) Project. A fully functional, 60-day demonstration copy of MS Project
2013 is included in this text. Exhibit 4.15 shows where MS Project is demonstrated in
this book. Each process is described in a step-by-step fashion using screen shots from a
single integrated project throughout the book.
4-7a MS Project 2013 Introduction
This introduction to MS Project 2013 focuses on what is unique to MS Project relative to
other Microsoft Office products. That uniqueness is driven in large part by visual and
calculation conventions long in use by Project Management Professionals (PMPs). This
introduction addresses those features that are visible when MS Project is started, as
shown in Exhibit 4.16.
1. Ribbon—The Microsoft Project ribbon is a command bar made up of seven tabs.
These tabs contain the controls (or access to controls) that are used to construct,
resource, baseline, status, and communicate information about a schedule.
•
The File tab includes familiar features such as open and save, but also info and
options.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

•
The Task, Resource, and Project ribbons provide for task, resource, and project data
entry and modification.
•
The Report ribbon provides standard reports as well as custom options.
•
The View ribbon allows selection of different views (single and combination
pane) plus tables, filters, groups, and forms.
•
The Format ribbon selectively displays only the formatting controls that apply to the
current active view. The Format tab header identifies the currently active view.
2. Project Schedule Information window—Below the ribbon are (one or optionally two)
horizontal panes that display information about the project schedule. If a two-pane
display is selected, a horizontal splitter bar divides the two panes. The bar may be
dragged up or down to allocate space between the panes. Only one pane is active.
A pane is activated by left clicking anywhere in the inactive pane. The active pane is
marked by a bolder blue vertical band at the far left of the application window.
Either the view name or the type of data is displayed in that blue band.
Customizable information formats displayed in a pane typically include:
a. Timeline—This graphic consists of a Gantt chart-like bar, which is a high-level
representation of the entire duration of the schedule. Key events along the dura-
tion may be marked. Parallel events may be shown stacked or as separate bars.
The timeline may be displayed singly or combined with a task or resource view.
If combined, it is in the upper pane.
b. Schedule Details—This is a presentation that displays the task, resource, and/or
assignment data that help form a schedule. Data are entered or calculated. Data
can be displayed in a table, a graphic, a timescale, or a combination of two of
these. A second pane may be added, displaying either the timeline (upper pane)
or a form (lower pane).
c.
Zoom Slider—Found in the lower right corner on the status bar, the zoom slider
is a control to quickly change the zoom level of graphical task views.
d. Quick View selector—Located in the lower right next to the zoom alider, this
control provides quick access to four useful views: Gantt chart, task usage, team
planner, and resource sheet.
e.
Default Task Mode selector—Displayed near the left side of the status bar, this
control reports the default scheduling mode (manual or automatic) for each new
task. To change the default, right click the control and click the desired default
setting from the list. Changing this setting will only apply to the active schedule.
4-7b Initialize Microsoft Project 2013 for General Use
There are two scheduling modes in MS Project 2013: Auto Scheduled and Manually
Scheduled. With Auto Scheduled selected, MS Project automatically calculates a schedule
as previous versions have, using a set of schedule drivers to calculate the start and finish
dates for all tasks and summaries. The Manually Scheduled mode ignores those drivers
(as per option settings), instead using manually entered data. Manually Scheduled is the
default for all new projects. We will now override that, making Auto Scheduled the
default, but allowing individual tasks to be manually scheduled as needed. Set Auto
Scheduled as the Default Task Mode, as shown in Exhibit 4.17.
1. On the File tab, Options, click Schedule.
2. On the Schedule page, Scheduling options for this project, enter All New Projects.
3. On the Schedule page, New tasks created, click Auto Scheduled.
4. Click OK.

Part 1 Organizing Projects

Summary
The project charter is a vital document since it enables
the project sponsor, project manager, and core team to
reach mutual understanding and agreement on the
project at a high level. All parties can commit to the
intent of the charter with confidence. Charters typically
include sections such as a scope overview, business
case, milestone schedule, acceptance criteria, risks,
and signatures. Many charters include
additional
sections.
The sponsor or leadership team might write the
rough draft of the business case and scope overview,
but the project manager and core team typically
write the rough draft of the majority of the charter.
Once the draft is written, the sponsor meets with the
project manager and core team to go over the charter
in detail both to ensure understanding and to reach
agreement.
The charter, by signaling commitment on the part
of the team and authorization on the part of the
sponsor, is the document that completes the project
initiating stage. Once the charter is complete, the
project team can usually turn their attention to
planning the details of the project. The first two
detailed planning topics, stakeholder analysis and
communication planning, are the subject of the next
chapter.

You are part of a student team that is going to
host a picnic-style party as a fund raiser event for
a deserving local nonprofit. Develop a milestone
schedule with acceptance criteria for this event.
Include between four and eight milestones.
4.
You are part of a student team that has volun-
teered to host an alumni event at a recently
reopened museum in the downtown part of your
city for the twin purposes of establishing contacts
with long-lost alumni and raising awareness of
the newly reopened museum. Brainstorm the
potential risks for this, quantify them both
according to probability and impact, assign
responsibility for each major risk, and create one
or more contingency plans for each major risk.
5.
You are part of a student team that is hosting a
number of inner-city junior high and high
school students from several nearby cities at
your campus for a weekend. The primary pur-
pose is to encourage them to attend college and
secondarily to attend your college. Identify as
many stakeholders as possible for this project,
prioritize them, and list the interests each has
in your project. You have started a project
working with your peers at your rival college to
create a “cross-town help-out.” You want to
encourage many people in the community to
contribute a day’s work on a Saturday for var-
ious community projects. You have a rather
heated rivalry with this other college. Create a
comprehensive set of team operating principles
to use on this project. Which of these principles
is most important and why? Do you expect any
of them to be difficult to enforce and why?
What do you plan to do if some of them do not
work?
Example Project
Determine, one member of your student project team
to be the primary contact with the project sponsor (the
manager or executive who came to class on the night
when projects were announced). The sponsor is also
the customer representative. This sponsor was encour-
aged by your professor to come with a draft of the
business case and scope overview sections of the char-
ter, but some sponsors probably did a better job than
others. You need to ensure that you understand these
statements and how they fit with the organization’s
goals.
Then your student team needs to draft the remain-
der of the charter with as much help as you can get
from the sponsor and/or other people at the organi-
zation. Once the charter is in rough draft form, sub-

the professor’s suggestions, you can present it to your
sponsor and any other people your sponsor chooses.
Often, this may involve a leadership team, depart-
ment heads (functional managers), and/or project
team members. One difference on this project is that
your student team will likely do most of the planning
and only part of the execution, while members of the
company or agency for whom you are planning the
project will need to complete the execution. There-
fore, you need to consider how you will transition
responsibility over to the parent organization near
the end of the class.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Headings:
Headings facilitate scan-
ning by identifying infor-
mation covered in each
section.
Heading descriptions
should accurately indicate
the information that
follows.
Lists:
Listing techniques help
readers remember key
details of a message.
Numbers, bullets, and
other ordering devices
promote retention and
improve visual design.
Lists are best limited to five
points so they do not look
overwhelming to readers.
Lists are written in parallel
structure, with the first
word of each item having
the same grammatical
form, such as all nouns, all
verbs, or all -ing words.

Scope Overview:
The scope overview defines
the major deliverables. It
sets project boundaries by
clarifying what is included
and, sometimes, what is
not included.
Business Case:
The business case defines
project objectives and why
they are important to the
parent organization.
Milestone Schedule:
The milestone schedule
shows the project starting
point, a few major
milestones, and the ending
point.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Tables:
Use tables to organize com-
plex information into an
easy-to-follow column and
row format.
Design tables so they make
sense when read indepen-
dently of the text.
Use table headings that
reflect logical groupings of
information.
Phrase column language so
it is in parallel structure.
Character Formatting:
Use character formatting,
including boldface, italics,
underlines, and centering to
highlight headings.
Use character formatting
hierarchically. Boldface,
underlines, and all caps are
best for major headings. Use
fewer or less dramatic tech-
niques for subheadings.
Type Size and Face:
Use 9, 10, 11, or 12 point
type for most documents.
Near-sighted readers prefer
larger type.
Use a conventional typeface,
such as Arial, Times Roman,
or Palatino.
White Space:
Use white space to separate
document sections attrac-
tively and to improve read-
ability.
Page Breaks:
When possible, complete
entire sections on the same
page. Redesign documents
where one or two lines of
text from a section run onto
the next page.

Stakeholder Analysis and
Communication Planning
Humans are social animals that engage with each other in complex ways,
especially in artificial environments such as organizations and projects.
Inexperienced project managers can become buried in the control of the project
plan’s tactical aspects and miss the more strategic components like stakeholder
engagement and effective communication. Ultimately, successful delivery of a
project is about both managing the tangible outputs (which are generally easily
and objectively measured) and leading others through the more strategic and
intangible outcomes. Traditionally, measures of success focus on scope, time,
cost, and quality to determine the success of the project as an entity. However, a
more accurate measure of success also considers the longer-term outcomes
delivered by what your project stimulated to happen after it was complete.
For example, the Sydney Opera House was a disaster as a project, but it
made highly significant contributions to the culture, identity, meaning, and
belonging of the Australian nation well beyond being a failed project, and there

project manager needs to become a skilled wordsmith and a psychologist (although
this would in fact be a very useful set of skills for a PM to have). The PMBOK is now
starting to build more content around these aspects of leading and managing
projects, and there is increasing literature acknowledging the importance of the
“soft skills” required to be a successful project manager. Capable project
managers invest effort to create and maintain informed stakeholder engagement
matrices and insightful communications plans. They know whom to engage at
what stage of the project (including critical stakeholders BEFORE the project starts
at times), at what frequency, and through what medium to secure optimal results.
They then implement this plan and adjust as circumstances change.
One effective and fun way a PM can accelerate the development of their
stakeholder engagement and communication skills is to use metaphor refle-
ctions developed by Arthur Shelley. This approach uses animals to represent
behaviors and stimulate constructive conversations about interactions between
people. The Organizational Zoo describes a set of 27 characters that collectively
represent the most common behaviors in the Zoo (that is, your team, project,
organization, or community). They are easy to remember (one for each letter of
the alphabet, plus one “double”), and the cartoon characters help to make the
conversation fun. Team members profile themselves and their stakeholders in
order to understand what they are like and how they should engage with them.
Because we all have considerable prior knowledge of animals, understanding is
intuitive, and the tool makes it easy to quickly assess our behavioral
environments. It is clear a mouse does not approach a lion in the same way it
would approach dog, and a lion leader is different from an eagle.
In projects, the use of creative tools such as metaphor and reflective
conversations
is
becoming
more
common
and
makes
a
significant
contribution to success and the learning experiences of those involved. The
free on-line profiler can be used for project team activities and to discover
more about your own inner animals.

5-1 Develop the Project Management Plan
Chapters 2 and 3 of this book discuss organizational issues such as strategic planning, project
selection, and roles of key individuals. Chapter 4 details how to initiate a project—usually by
composing and ratifying a charter. This chapter bridges initiating and planning. Exhibit 5.1
shows the process flow of getting a project started. Everything through the process “Identify
Stakeholders” is part of initiating projects, while “Plan Stakeholder Management and Plan
Communications Management” consists of planning processes.
Because each project is unique, a project team needs to plan specifically for each proj-
ect. While the details of each plan will differ, projects have many issues in common that
must be planned. For example, all projects are undertaken to achieve a purpose. This
means that a set of stakeholders wants the project results and that the results have scope
of work and quality considerations. All projects are subject to cost and scheduling con-
straints and are accomplished with and through people and other resources. The
116
Part 2 Planning Projects

planning for people includes both determination of who will work on the project and
how they will develop effective team and stakeholder relationships.
As stated in Chapter 1, project management is integrative, iterative, and collaborative.
Project planning must integrate the 10 knowledge areas described in the PMBOK®
Guide into a single project management plan. Develop project management plan is
“the process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all subsidiary plans and integrating
them into a comprehensive project management plan.”1 Project planning is iterative in
that one starts by planning at a high level and then repeats the planning in greater detail
as more information becomes available. Project planning is collaborative since there are
many stakeholders to be satisfied and a team of workers with various skills and ideas
who need to work together. For ease of understanding, in this book planning has been
divided into chapters, but a team cannot complete all the planning in a chapter-
by-chapter manner. Decisions made in planning one function will often require revisions
in another. For example, if the proposed schedule is too slow, perhaps a client will
authorize the use of overtime pay, which will probably increase the budget.
Effective project planning lays the groundwork for effective project execution, moni-
toring, control, and closeout. Developing effective team and stakeholder relationships
leads to a foundation of respect and trust, which, in turn, leads to project success, as dis-
played in Exhibit 5.2. Thus, during project planning, details of the various functions need

to be planned, and the groundwork needs to be established for effective team and stake-
holder relationships.
Projects vary tremendously in size and complexity. Therefore, project management
planning can vary from filling out a few simple templates to completing many detailed
forms and hosting multiple facilitated meetings. When a project team is trying to decide
how detailed the planning needs to be, the team members need to remember that the
purpose of the project management plan is to become a basis for executing, monitoring,
controlling, and closing all project work. It is wise to spend $100 in planning to save
$1,000 in execution, but not the other way around.
A project team develops a variety of plans for communications, schedules, budgets,
and so forth. They need to ensure these various plans all fit together into one unified
project plan. Typically, a good way to begin planning is to develop the outline of a proj-
ect management plan, which is “the document that describes how the project will be
executed, monitored, and controlled.”2 At this point, whatever documentation was devel-
oped in the process of initiating the project can be used.
Since both relationship building and detailed planning of the various project functions
need to occur simultaneously, our coverage will start with a type of planning that does
both. Plan stakeholder management is “the process of developing appropriate manage-
ment strategies to effectively engage stakeholders throughout the project life cycle, based
on the analysis of their needs, interests, and potential impact on project success.”3 Plan
communications management is “the process of developing an appropriate approach
and plan for project communications based on stakeholders’ information needs and
requirements and available organizational assets.”4
In this book, project management plans include stakeholders, communications, scope,
schedule, budget, resources, risks, and quality. While much of the planning is iterative,
we first discuss an understanding of project stakeholders—everyone who has an interest
in the process of performing the project work; in using the project deliverables; or who
can influence the project. Once a team understands who has an interest in or can exert
influence over their project, they can develop a communications management plan,
which is “a component of the project management plan that describes how, when, and
by whom information about the project will be administered and distributed.”5 After the
communications management plan, the project team will determine the scope. Once the
scope is determined, the project team can plan other aspects of the project, such as:
•
Schedule
•
Budget
•
Resources needs
•
Risks
•
Quality
Some of these issues impact others, so the team develops the project management
plan to ensure that all of these subsidiary plans work effectively together. One final and
important thing to remember is that the project management plan, once formally
approved, can only be updated and revised by formally approved changes. Many projects
have changes identified when the project is well underway and require replanning
throughout the project life cycle.
Agile and other forms of adaptive planning will not create nearly as much initial plan-
ning, but will have much of the planning occur on a just-in-time (JIT) basis.

Part 2 Planning Projects

5-2 Identify Stakeholders
Projects are undertaken because someone needs the project’s output. A project must sat-
isfy its users to be successful. Several things can complicate this. First, there may be mul-
tiple users, and each may have different wants and needs. Second, often users do not
fully understand what they want because they do not know what alternatives may be
available. Third, the customer who pays for the project may not be the actual person or
group who uses the result, and the customer may not fully understand the users’ needs.
Fourth, when someone else is paying for the project, some users will ask for many proj-
ect outcomes that are expensive or time consuming to deliver. Finally, many stakeholders
in addition to the users of a project’s outcomes have an interest in the project. Project
managers need to first understand their stakeholders, build relationships with them,
and then develop a communications management plan for dealing with them.
5-2a Find Stakeholders
One way to understand who stakeholders are is to ask, “Who will use or be affected by
the result of a project?” The answer includes users of the project results and others who
may have some changes forced upon them by the project. Identify stakeholders is “the
process of identifying the people, groups, or organizations who could impact or be
impacted by a decision, activity, or outcome of the project; and analyzing and document-
ing relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influ-
ence, and potential impact on project success.”6 Stakeholders include people who:
•
Work on the project
•
Provide people or resources for the project
•
Have their routines disrupted by the project
Another way to identify stakeholders is to determine whether they are internal to the
organization performing the project or external to it. Examples of project stakeholders
based on these categories are shown in Exhibit 5.3. Note that there are potentially more

types of stakeholders affected by the process of performing the project than by the proj-
ect results and more external than internal stakeholders.
Project managers and project core teams (often in consultation with their sponsor)
can use the examples in Exhibit 5.3 to find possible project stakeholders. This can be
conducted as a brainstorming session. Classic rules of brainstorming apply—initially,
the emphasis is on generating a long list of potential stakeholders in the first column of
a chart. It may be easiest to construct this chart on a large work surface such as a white
board or flip chart. Another suggestion is to be specific; identify stakeholders by name
when possible.
For each potential stakeholder, list the various project processes and results in which
he or she might have an interest. Consider both financial and emotional interests of
potential stakeholders. The project charter can be useful here. Many stakeholders have
an interest in multiple aspects of a project. Once the stakeholders and their interests
have been listed, they may be combined into like groups with the same interests.
5-2b Analyze Stakeholders
Stakeholder analysis is “systematically gathering and analyzing quantitative and qualita-
tive information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout
the project.”7 The first part of stakeholder analysis is to prioritize the stakeholders.
Prioritization is important because on many projects there are too many stakeholders
to spend a great deal of time with each. While it is important not to ignore any stake-
holder, it also makes sense to concentrate on those who are most vital. Stakeholders can
be prioritized based upon level of:
1. Authority (power)
2. Concern (interest)
3. Active involvement (interest)
4. Ability to affect changes (impact)
5. Need for immediate influence (urgency) or
6. Appropriateness of their involvement (legitimacy).8
Many project teams will use two or three of these. Each aspect used can be rated on a
simple scale of 1 to 3, with 3 representing the highest priority. For the first aspect, power,
a stakeholder who could order the project shut down or changed in a major way would
be a 3, and a stakeholder who could not change the project much would be a 1. The
other aspects can be analyzed in the same way. The scores from the aspects are added
to form a total prioritization score. Exhibit 5.4 shows this stakeholder identification and
prioritization.
By determining who the stakeholders are and what each group wants, project man-
agers effectively:
•
Set clear direction for further project planning, negotiating, and execution
•
Prioritize among competing objectives
•
Learn to recognize complex tradeoffs and the consequences of each
•
Make and facilitate necessary decisions
•
Develop a shared sense of risk
•
Build a strong relationship with their customers
•
Lead associates, customers, and suppliers with an empowering style
•
Serve as good stewards of the resources of both the parent and customer organizations
The project team should next select the top 10 to 15 stakeholders for emphasis in the
remainder of their planning. The stakeholders with the highest total scores are often
120
Part 2 Planning Projects

considered to be key influencers for the project. The project manager and core team
should also plan to periodically review this prioritized list of stakeholders, as the relative im-
portance may change as the project progresses, especially if the project goals are not clear at
the outset.
One additional consideration is that various stakeholders often have competing
interests. For example, the client may want the work done quickly while the accoun-
tant is worried about cash flow. Exhibit 5.5 itemizes how different types of stake-
holders frequently define project success. Another consideration is that the project
was selected to support a specific business purpose and that purpose should help
determine the relative importance of various stakeholders. Typically, when a conflict
exists, external paying customers and top management are considered to be highly
important stakeholders. If the project team developed the stakeholder identification
and prioritization matrix without their sponsor, now would be a good time to share
it with the sponsor and ask for feedback. Chances are good the sponsor will want to
make some adjustments before the team continues. Sponsors are especially useful in
helping to sort out conflicting priorities. The project team primarily considers these
top stakeholders while they:
•
Develop a communications plan (see next section)
•
Scope the project (see Chapter 6)
•
Identify threats and opportunities (see Chapter 10)
•
Determine quality standards (see Chapter 11)
•
Prioritize among cost, schedule, scope, and quality objectives (see Chapter 11)
5-2c Document Stakeholders
The primary output of the “identify stakeholders” process is a stakeholder register. The
stakeholder register is “a project document including the identification, assessment, and

classification of project stakeholders.”9 Teams use it to develop strategies to either capi-
talize upon stakeholder support or to mitigate the impact of their resistance. The stake-
holder register serves as input to relationship building with each stakeholder and helps
determine their requirements, which is the basis of developing project scope. The stake-
holder register is a living document that changes as needed. A stakeholder matrix for the
alternative breaks example project is shown in Exhibit 5.6.
5-3 Build Relationships
Project managers and teams seek to develop strong working relationships with important
stakeholders. This is an ongoing process throughout the life of the project. In fact,
the project manager normally continues to nurture the relationship even after the project
is completed to increase the chances of securing future project work. In building
relationships both within the project core team and with other stakeholders, project
managers need to remember that mutual respect and trust greatly enhance the prospect
of project success. Therefore, relationship-building activities that lead to respect and trust
should be planned and carried out carefully.
A principle idea in agile is that relationships with stakeholders need to be based upon
collaboration, communication, and trust. Analyzing stakeholder information helps the
team understand them better and leads to effective relationship building.

Typically, relationship building activities are most effective when they are used in the
process of planning a project. Project relationship-building activities that are described
more fully below and are especially useful include the following:
•
Share individual motives.
•
Encourage open communication.
•
Jointly establish agendas.
•
Use shared learning.
•
Regularly celebrate success.
•
Share enjoyment of project.
•
Use appropriate decision making and problem solving.10
5-3a Relationship Building within the Core Team
Project sponsors and managers who wish to create highly productive workplaces ensure that core
team members understand what is expected of them, have the chance to do work they are well-
suited to perform, receive appropriate recognition, have good coworkers, have their opinions con-
sidered, and have opportunities to grow and develop.11 The sponsor and the project manager ide-
ally begin by asking one another about personal expectations from the project. Each may have
project goals such as certain specific capabilities in the project deliverables. Both the project man-
ager and sponsor may have individual motives also. It is helpful to acknowledge these personal
goals to each other. The project manager, in turn, asks each core team member what he or she
personally wants from involvement in the project. These conversations not only help the project
manager understand priorities, but also motivations. For example, core team members may want
to participate in a stimulating experience, gain skill, or earn a promotion. Understanding these
motivations will make it easier for the project manager to address them.
The project manager can encourage open communication by keeping people informed,
showing that everyone’s input is valued, personally sharing feelings, and respecting confidenti-
ality. She should set the expectation that all team members also practice these habits.
Joint establishment of project meeting agendas helps with relationship building because
all team members feel their concerns are addressed, and they develop a greater sense of
ownership in meetings. When members get to share in meaningful project learning, they
feel their judgment is valued. Frequent celebration of small successes helps project team
members share the enjoyment of working on a project, which in turn helps them stay
committed to successful project completion.
One other key relationship-building activity that needs to start early and continue
throughout the project concerns appropriate decision making and problem solving. The
project manager and core team need to understand who makes each type of project
decision and how each is made. One consideration is that people involved in making
decisions tend to better support them. Decisions made by groups tend to take longer,
and projects are often pushed for time. Some decisions are best made by a single expert,
while others are best made by a group that represents various points of view. Each proj-
ect team will need to determine who will make which types of decisions. Exhibit 5.7 gives
general advice that can be applied in making this determination.
5-3b Relationship Building with All Other Stakeholders
Establishing a positive relationship early on with all key stakeholders is vital for two rea-
sons. First, it helps create a desire on the part of stakeholders to give positive support to
the project, or at least refrain from disrupting the project. Second, it serves as the com-
munications foundation for the project. The remainder of the project planning and exe-
cution are greatly enhanced by effective communications channels with key project
stakeholders.
124
Part 2 Planning Projects

Project teams create a stakeholder management plan that is “a subsidiary plan of
the project management plan that defines the processes, procedures, tools, and techni-
ques to effectively engage stakeholders in project decisions and execution based on the
analysis of their needs, interests, and potential impact.”12 A primary tool used in this
plan is the stakeholder engagement matrix. Engagement levels can be classified as
unaware, resistant, neutral, supportive, or leading.13 Exhibit 5.8 is an example showing
both where each stakeholder is currently (C) and where the team desires the stake-
holder to be (D).
The sponsor, project manager, and core team can establish powerful relationships
with key stakeholders by delivering on all promises, always providing fair treatment,
creating a sense of pride by association, and even helping the stakeholder develop a
passion for the project.14 This starts by learning what motivates each stakeholder.
The old saying “What is in it for me?” describes what each stakeholder wants, and
that is what the project team needs to understand. Stakeholders who feel threatened
can disrupt a project during its process and are less likely to perceive that they
receive project benefits in the end. Unhappy stakeholders are a sign of project failure.
On the other hand, stakeholders can be treated as partners right from the start of
planning by the project team speaking their language and providing them opportu-
nity to participate. These stakeholders are more likely to take ownership in the proj-
ect by educating the project team about their needs and making timely project
decisions and, in turn, are more likely to feel their expectations match the project

team’s plans. They are more likely to go beyond merely inspecting results and writing
checks. They may participate early and often when their input is meaningful and they
feel that the project is successful. All of the other project relationship-building activi-
ties listed previously can be applied in a similar fashion to that described for the core
team in the previous section. The important thing for project managers to remember
is that developing respect and trust among all project stakeholders is a goal that must
be started early and continued throughout the project. This is just as critical to proj-
ect success as the more technical planning and should also demand attention from
project managers.
5-4 Plan Communications Management
The project team should next create the communications management plan. This plan
guides the project communications and needs to be a living document that adapts to
changing project needs.
5-4a Purposes of a Project Communications Plan
Projects have many challenges, including technical, cost, and schedule difficulties. Failure
to manage any of these well can throw off a project. Another very common challenge to
project success is communication. Many projects require people to work together who
have not done so before. Projects may involve people from various functional areas that
all have their own unique challenges. People from multiple companies may end up
working together on projects. All projects are unique and therefore have different sets
of stakeholders. “Communication leads to cooperation, which leads to coordination,
which leads to project harmony, which leads to project success.”15
5-4b Communications Plan
Considerations
A myriad of considerations must be kept in
mind when creating a communications plan.
A project team can develop a workable com-
munications plan, use it, and improve it as
the project progresses. Some factors that
Fiesta® San Antonio organizers considered
when
creating
a
project
communication
plan are shown in Exhibit 5.9. These factors
apply to all project communications. There-
fore, we discuss these factors first and then explain who the project team needs informa-
tion from and to whom they need to supply information.
PURPOSE COLUMN The first column in Exhibit 5.10 instructs a project team to con-
sider the purpose for each communication. If there is no good use for the communication,
it makes no sense to develop it. A project manager must use effective communications to
set and manage expectations from all stakeholders as well as to ensure that project work is
completed properly and on time. Communications from stakeholders are necessary in
authorizing work, determining requirements, uncovering and resolving issues, and receiv-
ing feedback on project progress and results. Different stakeholders often have conflicting
desires; effective communications are necessary to understand and resolve these differences.
Communications to stakeholders are necessary to help them make good decisions (by
understanding options and risks), assure them of adequate understanding and progress,
enable them to more fully commit to the project, and be ready to accept project

EXHIBIT 5.9
FIESTA SAN ANTONIO COMMUNICATION PLAN NEEDS
In August 2012, the Institute of Texan Cultures, a museum specializing in Texas culture and diversity,
forged a partnership with the Fiesta® San Antonio Commission to produce a series of exhibitions
showcasing the traditions of Fiesta ®, San Antonio’s premiere festival. Fiesta® is an annual 10-day fes-
tival of over 100 events and 5 large parades. The festival draws 3.5 million visitors. It is tradition for
Fiesta® events to commission new medals each year to give to event-goers to wear and trade through-
out the festival.
The museum’s leadership team convened with the Fiesta® San Antonio Commission’s executive
director at the end of August to assemble a project management plan. The parties identified stake-
holders who would be impacted by the project. They prioritized stakeholders by influence, and
divided responsibilities for developing and maintaining relationships with each of those stakeholders.
The following challenges were anticipated:
•
It would take time for the 120 Participating Member Organizations (PMOs) to reach their
members and assemble a full collection of medals to loan to the museum.
•
Some PMOs might be offended if their medals were not displayed more prominently than
other PMOs.
•
The museum would be engaging the same PMOs to support future exhibitions, so it was
critical to maintain positive relationships.
It was clear that a comprehensive communications plan would need to be implemented
to establish lines of communication, nurture relationships, and manage the flow of information
between stakeholders.

deliverables. Yet another communication purpose is to plan and manage escalation of is-
sues that cannot be handled in a timely manner by the project manager. Wise project
managers determine in advance how soon an issue will be raised to the sponsor and/or
other decision makers. Finally, communications plans ensure that at project conclusion,
meaningful lessons can be documented to benefit future projects.
A project manager develops trust with her core team and other stakeholders partly by
using open communications to the extent possible. However, she needs to respect all
promises of confidentiality and to use good judgment on what is or is not appropriate to
share.
STRUCTURES COLUMN The second column suggests that if there are existing organi-
zational communication structures, use them! There is no need to reinvent every docu-
ment and, indeed, it would be confusing and costly to do so. Many stakeholders in
organizations are accustomed to a particular method of communications, and using
that method will make it easier for them to understand you. When no exact organiza-
tional model is available to follow for a particular communication, one can use a tem-
plate, which is still easier than creating an entirely new type of document.
Using any of the three choices, project teams need to maintain version control on all
of their communications. One easy method is to end the file name of every document
with six numbers representing year, year, month, month, and day, day. For example, an
early version of this chapter was saved on April 4, 2013, and the file name given was
“Chapter 5 Stakeholder Analysis and Communication Planning 130404.” The advantage
of a simple system is that the files can still be easily found by their descriptive named
titles, but they can also be sorted easily by the last date they were updated.
METHODS COLUMN The third column in Exhibit 5.10 deals with methods of commu-
nicating. Projects rely on “push” methods in which communications are sent or pushed;
“pull” methods where communications are posted either on paper or in electronic form
and interested stakeholders need to take the initiative to receive the communication; and
interactive methods in which communications flow in multiple directions. A typical proj-
ect communication plan will utilize a variety of these methods.
TIMING COLUMN The fourth column is a reminder that a project team needs to con-
sider timing issues when developing a project communications plan. Communications
typically are delivered according to one of three types of timing schedules. First is the
project life cycle, with communications typically needed at the end of each major stage
in the project and at the end of each major project deliverable. The second timing sched-
ule follows a more formal organizational structure. Project progress is often reported at
regularly scheduled meetings. Meetings at the frontline level are usually more frequent
than reports to higher levels within the organization. The third timing scheme is an
as-needed basis. Many times, a stakeholder wants to know a certain fact about a project
and cannot wait until the next formal meeting or report. Project teams need to keep
themselves up to date so they can handle the as-needed requests.
5-4c Communications Matrix
At this point, project teams will normally assemble a project communications matrix.
This matrix lists the following information:
Who
does the project team need to learn from?
What
does the team need to learn from this stakeholder?
Who
does the project team need to share with?
128
Part 2 Planning Projects

What
does this stakeholder need to know?
When
do they need to know it?
What
is the most effective communications method for this stakeholder to
understand?
Who
on the project team is responsible for this communication? (the owner)
An example of a completed project communications matrix is shown in Exhibit 5.11.
The communications needs of each project are unique, and, therefore, the assignment of
communications responsibilities will vary widely from project to project.
Stakeholders want to know how much work has been successfully delivered (accep-
tance tests passed) and how much work is remaining. Team members use the informa-
tion in specific and detailed formats to improve and motivate. Sponsors use the
information to strategically understand if the project will complete all work on time
and budget. Other stakeholders may share the sponsors’ overall concern, but want details
of work that concerns their function. While these communication needs are common on
all projects, agile projects have unique reports such as velocity, burn down charts, run-
ning tested features, and earned business value.16
5-4d Knowledge Management
If a company does extensive project work and uses project management capability as an
organizational strength, it is important to keep developing expertise in it. One way to
develop and expand expertise is to capture and reuse the knowledge developed. Knowl-
edge is “a conclusion drawn from information after it is linked to other information and

compared to what is already known.”17 To increase knowledge and the successful use
and reapplication of it, organizations often create a lessons learned knowledge base. For
this database to be useful, it is important to communicate project successes and failures
from all aspects of the project process. Captured throughout the life of the project,
recommendations to improve future performance can be based on technical, managerial,
and process aspects of the project. In addition, part of the project closeout process
should include facilitating a lessons learned session for the entire project, especially on
unsuccessful projects.
5-5 Project Meeting Management
Planning and conducting projects require a variety of meetings, such as meetings to:
•
Establish project plans
•
Conduct the project activities
•
Verify progress
•
Make decisions
•
Accept deliverables
•
Close out projects
Meetings are an important process on projects since many important decisions are made at
meetings and much time of expensive project personnel is invested in meetings.
One common feature of agile projects is the “stand-up meeting.” These short
(15 minute or less) meetings are often held at the start of each day with no coffee or
chairs to be comfortable. Each project team member briefly states what she accom-
plished the previous day, what she plans to accomplish this day, and what obstacles
may challenge her.
5-5a Improving Project Meetings
Project meetings should be conducted in as efficient and effective a manner as possible.
One way to improve the project meeting process is to apply the simple and effective
plan-do-check-act (PDCA) model.
PDCA MODEL The idea behind process improvement with the PDCA is that any pro-
cess practiced repeatedly, focusing on reusing and adapting things that worked well and
avoiding things that did not work well, improves over time. Exhibit 5.12 depicts the
PDCA model as it is applied to project meetings.
PROJECT MEETING AGENDA TEMPLATE When applying the PDCA improvement
model specifically to improving project meetings, the first step is planning the proj-
ect meeting in advance. The project manager makes sure that the agenda is pre-
pared and distributed ahead of time. If a project team is meeting often, this
advance agenda preparation may be done at the end of one meeting for the next
meeting. That way, everyone understands beforehand what will be covered in the
upcoming meeting and has the opportunity to be prepared. The agenda also can
be helpful in deciding whether to invite a particular subject matter expert (SME)
or other guest to the meeting. A project meeting agenda template is shown in
Exhibit 5.13.
The top part of the agenda contains meeting logistics. The second item on the tem-
plate asks for the meeting purpose. If a project manager cannot state in a sentence why
he wants to conduct a meeting, perhaps the meeting is not necessary. The main body of
the agenda has three columns. First is a list of the topics. This starts with a quick review
A G I L E
130
Part 2 Planning Projects

of the agenda, because projects often move quickly, and this provides an opportunity to
add or delete an item from the agenda. The major topics of the meeting are listed next in
the order in which they will be covered. Often, remaining items from previous meetings
or other urgent matters top the list. However, a project manager wants to be sure to
cover the most important matters, even if they may not have the same sense of urgency.
The second-to-the-last item on the standard agenda is the meeting summary. The project
manager summarizes major decisions that were made as well as work assignments that
were distributed. This helps people remember what they agreed to do. The final item on
the agenda is an evaluation of the meeting. This is explained in the check step of the
PDCA model.

The second column lists the person responsible for each topic on the agenda. Typi-
cally, the project manager takes care of the meeting start and close, but individual project
team members may be assigned specific action items. When people know in advance that
they are responsible for an action item, they are more likely to be prepared Additionally,
if the advance agenda is available for key stakeholders to see, some of the stakeholders
may contact the responsible person in advance to provide input. This is a good way to
keep stakeholders engaged.
The third column is a time estimate for each item. While the project manager does
not need to be a slave to the clock, recognition of how long team members are in meet-
ings and how many items are accomplished goes a long way. People are more likely to
attend a meeting if they are sure it will end on time.
PROJECT
MEETING
MINUTES
TEMPLATE The
second
step
in
the
PDCA
process—“do”—means to conduct the meeting and to capture minutes as the meeting is
conducted. Many project teams rotate the role of minutes taker so each team member
feels equal. A template for taking project minutes is shown in Exhibit 5.14.
5-5b Issues Management
The project minutes mirror the agenda to the extent that both refer to the same meeting.
The top part of the minutes form is logistics, just as in the agenda. The four primary
types of information captured in a project meeting are:
1. Decisions made
2. New issues surfaced and old issues resolved
3. Action items agreed to
4. An evaluation of the meeting

Part 2 Planning Projects

DECISIONS AND ISSUES First, any decisions that were made should be documented.
Second, any new issues that surfaced or existing issues that were resolved should be
recorded. An issue is “a point or matter in question or in dispute, or a point or matter
that is not settled and is under discussion or over which there are opposing views or
disagreements.”18 An issues log is “a project document used to document and monitor
elements under discussion or in dispute between project stakeholders.”19 Issues logs ben-
efit a project in at least two ways. First, when an important issue—but not one that can
be solved in the immediate meeting—is introduced, the project manager can add it to the
open issues and not spend time on it in the current meeting when more pressing matters
need to be settled. Second, the issues log ensures that important issues are not forgotten.
An issues log template is shown in Exhibit 5.15.
ACTION ITEMS The third type of project information is action items. Each of these is a
task that one or more members of the project team agree to perform by a specific date.
These are recorded, and the project manager reminds the team at the end of each meet-
ing what each member agreed to do.
EVALUATION The final item to be recorded on the project meeting minutes is an eval-
uation of both good points from the project meeting that the team would like to repeat
or at least adapt and poor points from the meeting that the team would like to avoid in
the future. An experienced team can collect these points in a minute or two; the time
they save in future meetings often pays great dividends. An easy way to capture these
evaluations is a Plus-Delta template as shown in Exhibit 5.16.

On agile projects this evaluation is called retrospectives.
When assessing the project meeting with a Plus-Delta method, a project manager
can simply draw the form on a flip chart or marker board. Then, each person is
asked to offer his opinion on at least one thing that either was good (+) that he
would like to see repeated or one thing that was poor (A) that kept the team back
somehow and he would like to see overcome in future meetings. The key to making
this work for the project manager is how she responds to any deltas. If the project
manager responds defensively, the team members may not want to offer further
suggestions.
Finally, the “act” part of the PDCA cycle for project meetings is for every team
member to complete the action items they promised and for the project manager to
communicate with the team members to make sure nothing is holding them back
from their commitments. Wise project managers keep active but informal contact
with team members between meetings to ensure action items are completed on
time. When all steps of the PDCA cycle are applied to project meetings, the meet-
ings improve; the team members gain satisfaction; and the project makes better
progress.
5-6 Communications Needs of Global and Virtual
Project Teams
As organizations change more rapidly, more projects are started with team members
from various parts of the larger organization, from various organizations, and even
from various parts of the world. These project teams certainly have the advantage of uti-
lizing talent from a wide pool of resources. Project team members often enjoy greater
autonomy and stimulation on these teams.
5-6a Virtual Teams
These advantages, however, come with added challenges. Since the team is not all
co-located, the project manager relies even more on persuasion than usual to accom-
plish work. In contemporary project management, project managers use less onerous
command and control than they might have a few years ago. This trend is even truer
with global and virtual teams. A virtual team is “a group of people with a shared
EXHIBIT 5.16
PROJECT MEETING PLUS-DELTA EVALUATION TEMPLATE
A G I L E
134
Part 2 Planning Projects

goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face.”20 When
project teams operate in a virtual mode, many of the following characteristics are
present:
•
Team members are physically dispersed.
•
Time boundaries are crossed.
•
Communication technologies are used.
Cultural, organizational, age, gender, and functional diversity is present.21
5-6b Cultural Differences
Cultural patterns differ in various parts of the world so project team members need
to be more sensitive to how their actions are interpreted. For example, in some cul-
tures looking a person in the eye signifies you are paying close attention, while in
other parts of the world people may look slightly downward in deference to author-
ity. In those cultures, looking a person in the eye might be considered a challenge.
When people do not have face-to-face contact, they do not have the opportunity to
see and learn from a person’s body language. Project managers working with global
and virtual project teams need to be especially mindful of the increased need for
communications using methods other than face to face. The various methods regard-
ing charter development described in Chapter 4, along with stakeholder analysis and
communications planning in this chapter, are even more critical on virtual and
global teams. The more unusual a team is, the more critical charters and communi-
cations vehicles become. Exhibit 5.17 lists some of the extra communications chal-
lenges
posed
by
virtual
and
global
project
teams.
Note
that
each
project
management need has a specific increased challenge—for example, the third need,
relationship building, needs more time since people do not have the advantage of full
face-to-face communication. Project managers and teams can enhance stakeholder
satisfaction by learning the cultural ethics and values of all their stakeholders, work-
ing hard to establish trust, and ensuring that they use fast and reliable information
systems.
5-6c Countries and Project Communication Preferences
It is helpful if the project team members can meet each other face to face even one
time. While this can be very expensive, it may be much less expensive than not per-
forming well on the project. Sometimes, the core project team is assembled to write

and approve the project charter. The core team members then know each other and
are inclined to give each other the benefit of doubt if there is a misunderstanding.
Another method that is frequently used is to confirm meetings and calls with quick
meeting minutes or e-mail follow-ups. By documenting decisions, it is easier to
remember what happened and to uncover lessons learned when the project is
complete.
While abundant differences occur between people from various countries, the
method and timing of project communications are of interest here. For example,
Mueller and Turner studied how cultural differences impact preferred modes of
project management communication.22 They examined how collectivism versus indi-
vidualism, along with the extent individuals in various cultures accept unequal
power and ambiguity, impact project communications preferences. The results
show that country preferences can be shown in four categories with common pre-
ferences on frequency and type of communications for each group, as shown in
Exhibit 5.18.
5-7 Communications Technologies
Perhaps one of the most exciting and rapidly changing aspects of project management
work is communications technologies. When the author first worked on projects in the
1970s, carbon copies were used extensively, careful printing was practiced so as to
not mistake a number in a calculation, bidders on construction contracts needed to
physically drive to a plans room to view plans and specifications so they could bid on
upcoming projects, and people would proof contracts and letters multiple times since
there were no spell checkers.
5-7a Current Technology Types
Current Technology TypesProject team members and other stakeholders need to be able
to respond to each other wherever they are. They need to be able to work creatively
together, have access to project documentation, and yet protect confidentiality and
version control. One important consideration to keep in mind is that communications
technology should make the project easier—not harder. Do not select the most current
technology for its own sake. Select whatever technology will help get the job done. Newer
communication technologies enable team members to work effectively from increasingly
remote locations.

Part 2 Planning Projects

Summary
This is the first chapter on project planning. After com-
pleting project initiation by writing and ratifying a
charter, a project team turns to planning. Planning is
iterative on projects. While there is a logical order to
planning, many times information that is developed
while planning one function causes a project team to
modify earlier planning. Nevertheless, it makes sense to
start
planning
by
identifying
and
analyzing
the
stakeholders.
Projects frequently have many diverse stakeholders.
Some stakeholders do not know exactly what they
want, and different stakeholders sometimes want dif-
ferent things. The project manager and sponsor need
to build effective working relationships with the project
team and stakeholders. When good relationships are
built and maintained, the project team can enjoy the
trust that is so helpful in successfully completing the
project.
Armed with the stakeholder analysis and the project
charter, a project team is ready to create a communica-
tions management plan. One important component of
this plan is the communications matrix. This is the
document that answers the questions:
•
Who needs to know something about the project?
•
What does each need to know?
•
When do they need to know it?
•
What format is easiest for them to receive and
understand the information?
•
Who is responsible for sending it?
Other important aspects of a project communica-
tions management plan include managing and improv-
ing meetings; managing and escalating issues; and
capturing and using lessons learned.
Many project teams work as virtual teams at least
part of the time. Some project teams have members
who are in various parts of the world. Virtual and
global teams share heightened communications chal-
lenges since they often cannot physically meet. Global
project management teams have the additional chal-
lenge of working with different cultures where meth-
ods of communicating may vary considerably. These
added challenges reinforce the need for understand-
ing stakeholders well and effectively planning project
communications.
Communications
technology
is
changing rapidly, and many applications can work
well for virtual and global project teams. The project
manager needs to carefully select the technologies
used so they help and do not pose added challenges.
Once stakeholders and communications are planned,
the project team can plan scope, schedule, resources,
budget, risks, and quality—the topics of the next six
chapters.

P R O J E C T M A N A G E M E N T I N A C T I O N
First of all two on-site visits at each location were
introduced in order to
1. get to know the location and the people involved
and
2. make sure all environmental preconditions agreed
upon had been properly set up.
For each location there were between 5 and 20
people involved who all needed special information
(depending on their role) thus multiplying the
planned effort of communication considerably.
However, the still early discovery of the complex
stakeholder situation also facilitated a degree of fast-
tracking and intensifying the cooperation, which was
essential to finalize the project in quality, time, and
budget, despite several buffer-consuming events,
with very favorable media coverage and proper
project close, which otherwise would have been
impossible.
Apart from the headmaster and IT teacher, what
other roles did we “discover”?
•
All teachers whose class rooms were involved (re-
ceiving equipment, have to move/exchange furni-
ture, rearrange the room).
•
Caretaker (usually the one who knew about walls,
wires, changes to the building, and the construction
history where there were no drawings available).
•
Owner of the building (community, private owner,
society).
•
Sponsor for each individual school (who had to agree
to a detailed plan and a float sum of money. This was
quite a topic since originally it was thought that a float
lump sum of money could be spent on the whole proj-
ect moving money between sites according to need.
The need differed greatly since a newly build school
(concrete/steel) poses a whole different range of tasks
as compared to 150-year-old converted castle schools
with thick walls (think of wireless LAN, think of “pro-
tection of historical monuments” = no drilling of holes
anywhere and a long analysis and certificates for
every little change to the building, think of moist or
even wet intended server locations).
•
The schools all had preferred local partners for elec-
tricity (dedicated electrical phases for 19”server,
power supply and network equipment, ideally dry
and ventilated and cool, usually a small moist place
with no air flow at all like a broom closet of the
Harry Potter type in Privet Drive).
After being appointed PM for rollout and implementation I noticed that this was far from enough and needed
to be amended.

•
Structural fire protection authority (they had serious

•
Regional politicians who support the improvement
of learning environments.
•
Media who supported the project in terms regional

and

the

to
improve education and bring up-to date learning
facilities also to the more rural areas.
•
And not to forget the neighborhood and especially
the parents (in particular the ones less IT enthusias-
tic) who needed a good portion of convincing that
this was something big and essential to their kids’
development and future chances.
What finally saved the project?
1. Initial core team brain storming and proper
stakeholder analysis (no matter whether according
to PMI, IPMA, or PRINCE2, list them all, check their
expectation, interests, influence, power, degree of
potential support, and involvement).
2. Two alternative Meetings informing all interested
parties (obligatory to certain stakeholders and
open to the public and invited media), so everyone
KNEW, everyone received a roughly 50-page
handout with detailed plans and intentions,
involvement of all relevant parties, order of
steps, phases of progress, ways of
communication etc.
3. A short pilot consisting of 8 schools, 2 schools of
every one of the 4 different types (primary/small,
secondary/middle, gymnasium/large, special needs)
helped us group the remaining location in mixed
regional groups for each rollout team, scheduling
the whole procedure was a challenge because due
to different sizes and varying numbers of
equipment, totally different buildings etc. there was
no chance to cut everything into weekly time boxes
à la “sprints” in agile scrum. Instead every team had
their own stream of tasks, consisting of nearly the
same steps, however, with independent underlying
amounts of effort.
4. At virtually every first on-site visit someone
unexpected played a vital role (relevant for
interdependency of activities, e.g., schedule, cost,
resources, communication, risks, basically the whole
range of PM topics), we (the project core team on
“whistle stop tour,” usually four to five people)
explained everything we said at the two kickoff
meetings again, answered more questions, and
made clear that local support according to schedule
was vital and deliberately failing to meet deadlines
meant moving down the list and along the time line.
5. During the second on-site meeting we checked
the “preconditions ready” and if so delivery and
set up of IT equipment were approved, if not
another school from further down the list was
invited to move up if they met the criteria.
6. Every piece of equipment had a checklist, all functions
were tested and ticked off by a technician and a school
representative reporting status “green,” which
automatically approved the final steps including
training of staff on-site by the same technicians who
worked on-site the 1–2 weeks beforehand.
Bear in mind:
1. Have a plan You need to follow a . systematic
approach throughout the project.
2. Employ structured Information.
3. Pilot what you do.
4. Communicate face to face on site.
5. Have clear rules.
6. Have a realistic time line, incl. buffers for all sorts of
risks and additional stakeholder involvement
wherever necessary.

Scope Planning
You’re browsing a favorite retailer’s website, and you notice the onscreen
recommendations are just right for you. The site seems to know what you’ve
bought before. This great customer service is enabled by the retailer’s web
intelligence solution from Teradata.
Teradata is the world’s largest company focused solely on enterprise data
warehousing and analytic solutions. The simple web shopping scenario is just
one example of how our customers use information to improve their
relationship with you.
So what does this have to do with project scope management? In this
example the retailer purchased a Teradata solution that included hardware,
software,
and
a
consulting
project
for
the
implementation.
Teradata
implemented this project based on our experience and a methodology built
upon a foundation of scope management.

Topics:
• Plan scope
management
• Collect requirements
• Define scope
• Create WBS
• Change requests
We can manage scope in various ways—ranging from traditional waterfall to
agile approaches—but must manage scope to deliver the right solution in an
efficient manner.
The first step in project scope management is to mutually agree what the
project will deliver. In our example, the retailer needed to integrate data from
their web analytics software, an in-house customer relationship system, and
other sources. They also had requirements for reports and the technical
integration with their IT infrastructure. The Teradata team elicited requirements
in a way that uncovered what the customer really needed.
Projects often use a statement of work (SOW) or similar document to outline
the high-level scope. In a Teradata project, this is part of our customer contract.
We then elaborate more detailed requirements in a traceability matrix. This
ensures all requirements tie “end to end” from the contract through project
testing and customer acceptance. The time spent up-front in requirements
management pays dividends during project testing and customer acceptance,
where discovering unknown requirements is much more time consuming and
expensive.
Teradata follows traditional project management practice to develop a
work breakdown structure (WBS) as the basis for a detailed project schedule
and resource plan. We typically use Microsoft Project as a scheduling tool; a
plan based on the WBS makes it easy to track and communicate the status of
each deliverable.
Finally, the entire set of requirements is managed under change control. This
is an important process, because the team must balance control and flexibility.
We also must meet (or agree to change) the project cost and schedule
parameters. Our project manager facilitates an analysis of the technical,
schedule, and cost impact—then all parties reach a mutual agreement on how to
proceed.
This simple example illustrates how the Teradata project methodology
builds upon a foundation of scope management to deliver exactly what the
customer needs in the most efficient manner. An effective scope management
approach fosters open communications and sound decision making to ensure
all parties get the business value expected from the project.

6-1 Plan Scope Management
Once all of the stakeholders for a project have been identified, the project team members
plan scope management, collect project requirements, define the project’s scope, and
create a work breakdown structure (WBS). These are the scope planning processes that
will be covered in this chapter. When planning scope, it is also wise to plan for changes.
While this is not technically part of scope planning, it will also be covered in this
chapter.
The flow of scope planning is illustrated in Exhibit 6.1. The boxes represent the proj-
ect work processes involved, and the documents shown before and after the boxes repre-
sent major inputs needed to perform the processes as well as major outputs created by
the work processes. Documents covered in previous chapters (Charter in 4 and Stake-
holder Register in 5) are needed inputs for the first two processes.
The first scope process, plan scope management, is “the process of creating a scope
management plan that documents how the project scope will be defined, validated, and
controlled.”1 The product scope is “the features and functions that characterize a prod-
uct, service, or result.”2 The project team also needs to determine the project scope or
“the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features
and functions.”3 Together, the product scope (the outputs the team will deliver to its
customers) and the project scope (the work they need to perform to create the project’s
outputs) form the total scope. In other words, the project team members determine what
they will do to ensure they have identified and organized all of the project work so they
can use it as the basis of all other planning and then as the basis for executing and con-
trolling the project work.
6-2 Collect Requirements
Collect requirements is “the process of defining, documenting, and managing stake-
holder needs and requirements to meet project objectives.”4 The first step in collecting
requirements is to ensure that the project team is absolutely clear on the project objec-
tives. This could be accomplished by reviewing the project charter—particularly the
“why” section that justifies the project. The project team members then may describe in
more depth what each believes the expected project benefits are and/or what problems
the project is attempting to overcome. On simple projects, this may take just a few min-
utes. On complex projects, a project manager may choose to use idea generation, group-
ing, and/or cause-and-effect techniques to make sure that everyone on the project team

understands why the project is being conducted. Understanding broad project objectives
will help in making more detailed decisions later. This also reinforces the project’s
importance and may help motivate team members and other stakeholders during chal-
lenging times. It is especially useful with multifunctional, virtual, and global project
teams. Finally, a clear understanding of the project’s objectives helps if the project needs
to be replanned at some point.
6-2a Gather Stakeholder Input
The second step is to gather input from the various project stakeholders. When a project
manager and team listen closely to both internal and external customers, they under-
stand better both what their needs are and what risks and issues may confront them
during the project. Successful project managers know that for a project outcome to be
useful to the project’s customers, the customers need to be able to use the output to
better serve their own customers in turn.
The methods of developing deep understanding of customers and their needs vary
extensively from one industry to another. For example, in new product development
projects, teams often use voice of the customer (VOC) techniques to elicit the benefits
and features the customers want out of the project expressed in the customer’s language.
Teams using VOC try to understand the customer by not only asking questions, but also
by placing themselves in the customer’s situation. If a project team is designing a new
system that is to be used in the field, the team member should get down in the mud
with the mechanic and hand the mechanic repair tools to see from the mechanic’s point
of view how the new system will be used.
Once captured, these customer wants and needs are then stated in operational terms
that the people performing the project work can use to plan their work. If the customer
wants blue food coloring in a food item, the project team developing the item needs to
know the precise desired shade of blue, the tolerance for color variation, and how the
blue color may interact with other ingredients.
The project manager wants to understand how a project’s success will be determined
from the customer’s perspective. The best way to gain this understanding (and to begin
building a strong relationship with customers) is to directly ask customers. The project
leaders can ask the customer(s) to specify how they will judge the quality of the project.
On an information systems project, the team may use a joint application design (JAD)
session to elicit customer requirements. This is often a facilitated session in which users of
the software state what their preferences are regarding how the software should work. The
project manager and team often send the users their understanding of the project objectives
and deliverables in advance so the users are better prepared to discuss their needs. Only one
group of users is normally in this meeting at a time, while the project manager and the tech-
nical workers are in the session the entire time. Each possible feature of the system should be
discussed. If the system is large and complicated, the amount of time that can be spent per
item may be restricted. Users often wish to talk in depth about how they want to use
the system, and developers often want a detailed discussion about how they plan to create
the feature. To avoid sinking into too much detail, the project manger can ask the users to
start with only a high-level description of their reason for the requested feature and then
guide the discussion with the following five questions:
1. What do we not understand about the request?
2. What is the business reason for the request?
3. What is the impact of not providing this feature?
4. What action items need to be accomplished if we do this?
5. What impact will this have on other parts of the project or elsewhere?
Chapter 6 Scope Planning
147

On some types of projects, the customers can give their ideas using one of the techniques
above, and the project team can be confident that the customers’ wants and needs have been
captured. On other projects, once the customers’ viewpoint is captured, it makes sense to
create a model or prototype of some sort so the customers can decide if their wishes have
been fully and accurately captured. Often, this extra step helps the customers to be more fully
vested in the project and creates a strong working relationship that is helpful when
difficulties arise during project execution.
It is helpful to list requirements and their supporting information in a requirements
traceability matrix such as that shown in Exhibit 6.2. When requirements are complete
each needs to be:
•
Traceable back to the business reason for it
•
Identified with the stakeholder(s) who need it
•
Clear so everyone understands it the same way
•
Measurable so its value and completion can be verified
•
Prioritized according to value, cost, time risk, or mandate so tradeoff decisions can
be made if needed
6-3 Define Scope
Define scope is “the process of developing a detailed description of the project and product.”5
Essentially, the project scope statement includes three things regarding the total scope. First,
the team needs to determine both what they will deliver to the project stakeholders at the
end of the project and what they need to deliver along the way to ensure they will be successful
in the end. These are the deliverables—the product scope. For example, if a final project deliv-
erable is a new computer program, intermediate deliverables may include an outline of what
will be included and a prototype. Second, the team should decide what work needs to be
accomplished to create the deliverables This is the project work statement—the project scope.
Third, the team needs to determine what will limit or influence the project work—such as
exclusions, constraints, and assumptions.
6-3a Reasons to Define Scope
Scope definition is an important part of project planning because all other planning is
based upon the project scope. While the requirements collected represent the customers’
statement of what they need, the defined scope is the project team’s response—asking the

Part 2 Planning Projects

customer, “If we provide this, will it solve your problem?” It is impossible to estimate
how much a project will cost, how many (and what type of) workers will be needed,
how long a project will take, what risks are involved, or what quality standards will be
invoked without first understanding what work the project includes.
Scope definition also is vital in preventing scope creep. Scope creep happens for two com-
mon reasons. First, if the scope is not clearly defined and agreed upon, it is easy to add to the
project without realizing that more time and money will be required. Second, sometimes
when a project is going well, a customer is so excited that he or she asks an innocent-
sounding question: “Can the project output also do… ?” The person performing the project
work is often flattered and agrees without understanding the implications. In contemporary
business, pleasing the customer is desirable. However, the best time to gain customer under-
standing is when the project team is defining the scope—not while working to implement it.
6-3b How to Define Scope
Scope definition can vary greatly from one project to another. On some types of projects,
such as a small, routine construction project, it may be quite simple to determine what
project outputs will be created and what work is involved in creating them. On other
projects, such as one large company acquiring another, it may be very difficult to deter-
mine the total amount of work that needs to be accomplished. Regardless of how easy or
difficult it may be to define scope and in spite of industry-specific methods that may be
helpful in doing so, all project teams need to complete each part of this process.
LIST DELIVERABLES AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA The first step is to list project
deliverables. The requirements elicited from the customer often lead to some of the
final deliverables. Project teams need to understand that there are often multiple
deliverables. For example, if a project entails constructing a house, the homeowners
probably want not only the house but also documentation on systems within it,
perhaps an explanation (training) on how to use certain items such as an innova-
tive thermostat, and a warranty guaranteeing a properly functioning house. The
project team also needs to list intermediate deliverables—those things that need to
be developed for the project to progress. Some of these were probably listed in the
charter, but others may not yet be identified. The project team then needs to deter-
mine the acceptance criteria for each deliverable.
ESTABLISH PROJECT BOUNDARIES The second step in defining scope is to establish
the project boundaries. Think of the project boundaries as the sidelines on an athletic field.
By understanding what is in play and what is not, athletes know clearly when to play and
when to stop. Likewise, project team members need to know when to play and when to
stop. The first part of the boundary definition is to decide which features and work elements
are included (in scope) and which are excluded (out of scope). Users collectively often
request far more work than a project can deliver. Therefore, the team needs to decide what
is included and what is not. Sometimes, the sponsor makes the larger scope decisions, but
the project manager and team still have many detailed scope decisions to make.
Expectations need to be managed regarding any project. The project team members
need to understand the constraints imposed upon the project. If the work must be deliv-
ered by a certain date or if only limited resources are available, the project may be con-
strained, and the team should be careful to only promise what it can deliver. In planning,
people make assumptions about dates and times, such as that a shipment of required
materials will arrive by the date the supplier promised. These assumptions should be
stated. If an assumption proves to be false, it frequently increases the project risk and
may also limit the project scope.
Chapter 6 Scope Planning
149

CREATE A SCOPE DESCRIPTION The final step is to create a scope description. This sen-
tence or two describes the work that needs to be accomplished to create the project deliverables.
A project scope statement guides the project team during subsequent planning and
execution. On some very small projects, a well-developed charter could double as a scope
statement. On most projects, a scope statement needs to be developed prior to develop-
ment of the WBS. An example scope statement for the Alternative Breaks project is
shown in Exhibit 6.3.
6-3c How to Define Scope in Agile Projects
On agile projects, the scope definition starts with user stories. The team creates “per-
sonas,” which are fictional people who represent user types and then asks what will
they do with the project deliverables and how will they benefit. These user stories de-
fine scope and functionality. Acceptance tests will also be agreed upon at this time by
describing the manner in which project deliverables will be tested and how they
should prove workable. At the project outset, the overall scope is only defined at a
high level and a backlog of possible work is identified. The customer representative
(sometimes called the owner) prioritizes the scope based upon business need, value,
cost, and risk. The team then commits to the amount of work they can perform in
the first iteration. As the project progresses, the scope is described more specifically
and is documented more closely.
6-4 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A tool that is used on virtually all projects is the WBS. To understand this tool, we first
define it, tell why it is important, show several common formats to use when constructing
one, and demonstrate the steps required to construct a WBS.

Part 2 Planning Projects

6-4a What Is the WBS?
The work breakdown structure or WBS is a tool that project teams use to progressively
divide the deliverables of a project into smaller and smaller pieces. The project team
members start by identifying the major deliverables to be created and keep asking
“What are the components of this deliverable?” The WBS is not a list of work activities,
an organizational chart, or a schedule. Other tools that follow are used for those
purposes. The WBS is a framework that is used as a basis for further planning, execution,
and control.
Classically, and still today on large projects, the WBS is created after the
scope is defined. In contemporary project management, particularly on small and
middle-sized projects, the WBS may be created concurrently with the scope
statement.
The WBS is normally developed by listing deliverables—first major deliverables
and then progressively smaller ones until the team feels that every deliverable has
been identified. Managers of smaller projects sometimes perform another process
concurrent with WBS development: defining activities and milestones. Define activ-
ity is “the process of identifying the specific actions to be performed to produce the
project deliverables.”6 Many people find that work activities can be easily defined
once the various deliverables are itemized. To clearly distinguish between the work
processes of WBS development and activity development, WBS development is cov-
ered in this chapter, and activity development is covered as part of project schedul-
ing in the next chapter. Developing the WBS and defining the activities form an
example of how two separate work processes are sometimes performed together
(especially on small or simple projects) and sometimes separately (especially on large
or complex projects).
6-4b Why Use a WBS?
The reasons for using a WBS are many. Planning projects requires discipline and
visibility. A WBS can be used as a pictorial representation of project deliverables.
By using a systematic process for creating a WBS, project team members can
ensure that they remember all deliverables that need to be created. Deliverables
that are not planned, but need to be, often add to schedule delays and budget
overruns.
The WBS is the basis for all subsequent planning of such important functions as
schedule, resources, cost, quality, and risk. It serves as an outline for integrating
these various functions. The WBS is easily modified and can thus handle the
changes that often happen on projects. The impact of these changes is then shown
in the schedule, budget, and other control documents. If a problem occurs during
project execution, the WBS is helpful in understanding exactly where and why the
problem occurred. This helps to manage the quality of the project deliverables
and keep all the other facets of the project on schedule while the isolated problem
is fixed.
The WBS is also helpful in project communications. Typically many stakeholders help
develop the WBS, and this effort helps them understand the project. Software such as
Microsoft Project enables a WBS to be shown in its entirety to people who need to
understand the details, but it also allows project details to be hidden so that others can
see the big picture.
Chapter 6 Scope Planning
151

6-4c WBS Formats
There are various formats for constructing a WBS, but they all have the same purpose.
The overall project is considered the first level, as shown in Exhibit 6.4. In this example,
a WBS for a house is presented in the indented outline format.
The second level in this example depicts major deliverables from the house project,
namely the house in its framed state, when it is wired, and when it is drywalled. This
second level is indented one tab. Note that a section is included for the work of planning
and managing the project.
A WBS usually has one or more intermediate levels, which generally represent items
that need to be created in order to produce the final deliverables, such as drafts, proto-
types, designs, and so on. These are frequently called interim deliverables. All levels of
the WBS with at least one level below are considered summary levels. The completion of
summary-level elements is based upon completion of all levels underneath. For example,
in Exhibit 6.4, the house would not be framed until the framing contractor, wood, and
assembled frame interim deliverables were complete.

Exhibit 6.4 used the indented outline format for WBS method, but other methods are
sometimes used. One other method is the hierarchical or “org chart” (short for
organizational chart, which it resembles) method. A third method is called free format
because the facilitator is free to draw it in any manner. The same house project shown
in Exhibit 6.4 in indented outline format is shown in Exhibit 6.5 in org chart format and
in Exhibit 6.6 in free format.
Both of these methods allow a team to use a marker board or flip chart
and have plenty of room to add additional elements as people think of them.

The WBS method using indented outlines can easily be imported into MS Project. Teams
using the org chart or free format methods to develop their WBS generally translate it
into the indented outline format for input into software.
6-4d Work Packages
The house example above has only three levels as follows:
1. The first level, or project title level
2. One intermediate level, or summary level
3. The lowest level, or work package level
In a WBS, an element at the lowest level is called a work package, which is “the work
defined at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure for which cost and duration
can be estimated and managed.”7 Work packages are the basis for all subsequent plan-
ning and control activities. Exhibit 6.7 shows a WBS in org chart format with work
packages in solid boxes.
One frequently asked question when breaking the deliverables into work packages is
how small is small enough. The answer is, “It depends.” In Exhibit 6.7, work packages
occur at levels 3, 4, and 5. The work package is the point from which:
•
Work activities are defined
•
The schedule is formed
•
Resources are assigned
•
Many of the control features are developed
Work packages need to be detailed enough to facilitate further planning and control.
If they are too detailed, the burden of tracking details increases. The project manager
needs to feel confident that the work to create the deliverable can be assigned to one
person who can estimate the schedule and cost and can be held responsible for its com-
pletion. If the work is well understood, a single deliverable is to be produced, it is clear

how the deliverable will be judged for quality and completeness, and the assigned worker
has proven reliable in the past, the level may not have to be too detailed. On the other
hand, if the deliverable and how it will be judged are poorly understood and the assigned
worker has yet to be proven reliable, a more detailed level may make sense.
For ease of reading, work packages and other components on a WBS are usually
stated in very few words. A WBS component is “an entry in the WBS that can be at
any level.”8 Enough words should be used so the same name is not used more than
once. However, because the names are typically short, there is still the potential to get
confused by exactly what is included in a particular work package. Therefore, WBS
components are often defined further by creating a WBS dictionary. A WBS dictionary is
“a document that provides detailed deliverable, activity, and scheduling information
about each component in the WBS.”9 An example of a WBS dictionary entry with de-
tailed information for a work package is shown in Exhibit 6.8. Note that some of this
additional information such as activities, resource assignments, effort, and cost will be
described in subsequent chapters.
6-4e How to Construct a WBS
When a project team needs to construct a WBS, it needs to include in its planning team
a subject matter expert (SME) who understands how each portion of the work will be
accomplished. Teams approach this in two ways. Some teams include only the core
team members and plan the WBS as far as they can. At that point, different core team
members are assigned to assemble the SMEs they need to plan the remaining details.
Other teams invite the SMEs to the WBS planning meeting right from the start and
utilize their input right away. The choice of how to include SMEs often is determined
by the size and complexity of the project and by the cultural norms of the company.
The planning team uses a top-down approach in creating the WBS. This is easy to
start when the type of project is familiar and at least some members of the planning
team are likely to understand the general flow of work. If the project is similar to others

performed, either a template or the WBS from a previous project can be used as a start-
ing point, with the team then asking what else this project needs and what items from
the template or previous project can be skipped. Templates and previous examples can
save teams a great deal of time, but they must be used with caution because each project
is different.
Sometimes, however, a project is so different from previous work that the team finds
it useful to jump-start the WBS construction by brainstorming a list of project deliver-
ables just to understand the overall structure of the project. However, once the overall
structure is understood, the team proceeds with the typical top-down approach for the
remainder of the WBS construction.
IDENTIFY MAJOR DELIVERABLES The team defines the project product by reviewing
the project planning completed so far. The team members review the project charter,
requirements matrix, and scope statement so they can state what the project’s major
deliverables will be. Remember that while many projects may have a primary deliverable
such as a house, almost all projects have additional deliverables dealing with documenta-
tion and customer enablement. These could include training, service, or other means of
helping the customer use the project’s products effectively.
One of the first decisions to be made is how to organize the second level of the WBS.
(Remember the first level is the overall project.) Three methods are shown in Exhibit 6.9.
One method is by project phase, with the second level being the signing of a contract,
building the foundation, and framing the house. Alternatively, the second level can be
organized by design components, such as kitchen, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Finally,
the second level can be organized by work function. A house project organized this way
might have carpentry, plumbing, and electrical as second-level elements.
Organizing by project phase has the advantage of using the milestones in the project
charter as an organizing principle. It also facilitates rolling wave planning. Rolling wave
planning is “an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in
the near term is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a higher
level.”10 If the planners of the project in Exhibit 6.9 used rolling wave planning, the
work associated with the contract would be planned in detail immediately, and work
for the foundation and framing might only be planned at a high level at first with more
detail worked out as the project team worked on the contract. Rolling wave planning
allows a team to get a quick start on a project—especially one where details of later
phases may depend on the results of work performed during early phases. Rolling wave
planning helps a project team avoid either of two extremes. One extreme is to never start
doing anything because the plan is not yet complete, which is also known as analysis

paralysis. The opposite extreme is not planning at all because of fear that planning will
take too long; this is known as ready, fire, aim.
Organizing by either phase or design components helps to focus communications on
project deliverables and their interactions. Organizing by work function allows the
functions to focus on their specific activities, but often does not promote cross-
functional discussion. Handoffs of work from one group to another are not always as
smooth. Therefore, if a project manager decides to organize the WBS by work function,
extra care needs to be taken in establishing inter-functional communications.
Note that one additional second-level item is shown on all three methods—that of
project management. This includes the work of planning and managing the effort and
includes preparing documents, attending meetings, integrating diverse portions of the
project, handling communications, and so on. Since much of the work involved in proj-
ect management is level of effort, this section may not be decomposed. If the work of
managing the project is left out, it is more likely that the project will not be completed
on time and within the budget.
DECOMPOSE DELIVERABLES Once the major deliverables have been defined, it is
time to break them into smaller deliverables or components. This is called decomposi-
tion, which is “a technique for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project
deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts.”11 The team members can use the
top-down approach, asking what all the components of each major deliverable are. Alter-
natively, the team members may use a bottom-up approach by brainstorming a list of
both interim and final deliverables that they feel need to be created. Each deliverable
can be written on an individual Post-it Note. These deliverables are then assembled on
a large work space where team members group the smaller deliverables either under the
major deliverables that have been previously identified or into additional related groups
that are then headed by major deliverables.
CONTINUE UNTIL DELIVERABLES ARE THE RIGHT SIZE At this point, the WBS has
been formed and can be reviewed for completeness. Once it is determined to be com-
plete, the team can ask if the deliverables at the lowest level need to be divided again to
be at the proper size for further planning and control as described above. For example,
in the new car development project in Exhibit 6.10, level-two components, such as prod-
uct design, are at too high of level. Therefore, at least one further level is included. If
some of those components, such as product goals, are still too broad, yet another level
would need to be developed.
REVIEW At this point, several things should be considered to ensure that the WBS is
structured properly. One consideration with WBS construction is the parent-child con-
cept. The higher level is considered the parent and the lower-level elements are consid-
ered children. For example, in Exhibits 6.4 through 6.6, “Framed House” is a parent to
the children: “framing contractor,” “wood,” and “assembled frame.” “Framed House,” in
turn, is a child to “HOUSE.” The framed house component is not complete until all of
its children components are complete. The team asks if, once these elements are com-
plete, the framing is complete. In an effort to simplify the WBS, where only one child
element for a parent exists, you would not break it down. In fact, a good rule of thumb
is to have somewhere between three and nine child elements for each parent. The fewer
levels a WBS has, the easier it is to understand.
To avoid confusion, each component in the WBS needs to have a unique name.
Therefore, two similar components may be “draft report” and “final report,” instead of
merely calling each “report.” The team also assigns a unique number to each component.
In one common numbering system, the number for a child item starts with the number
Chapter 6 Scope Planning
157

assigned to its parent and adds a digit. An example of a WBS with components num-
bered is shown in Exhibit 6.11.
Different organizations sometimes develop their own unique variations of project
planning and control techniques. Exhibit 6.12 describes the manner in which a large,
complex organization (the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency) combines stakeholder
analysis with WBS.
6-5 Establish Change Control
A baseline is “the approved version of a work product that can be changed only through
formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison.”12 The project
team looks at the scope statement and WBS to ensure completeness and seeks to validate
the scope by consulting with the sponsor, customers, and/or other stakeholders. Simulta-
neously, the project team can be planning other aspects of the project such as schedule,
resources, budget, risks, and quality. Once all of these plans are complete and any impacts
to scope have been accounted for, it is time to baseline the scope statement and the entire
project plan. This is discussed in more detail at the end of the planning stage.
Most projects are planned and conducted in an atmosphere of uncertainty. Projects
are planned making assumptions based upon the best information available to the proj-
ect team, but many things can change during the course of a project. Therefore, project
teams deal with change by establishing and using a change control system, which is an
“approved set of procedures that describes how modifications to the project deliverables
and documentation will be managed and controlled.”13 Uncontrolled change is known as
scope creep. Sometimes, the effects of scope creep are so bad that a well-started project
can run into serious trouble.
The critical portion of a change control system is the method of documenting changes.
Each potential change to a project is normally documented by some sort of change
request, which is “a formal proposal to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline.”14
This means every change to a project needs to be formally proposed. The poten-
tial change is then either accepted or not. If it is accepted, the project plans are
changed to reflect the impact of the change. Most people quickly understand the

need to document major changes, but some resist the effort it takes to document
small changes. The impact of many small changes is like the old saying “killed by
a thousand small cuts.” Many small changes individually have small impacts on a
project, but collectively they have a major impact. Project managers need to create
an expectation that all changes be formally documented using a simple change
request form so all team members will document proposed changes. A simple
change request form is shown in Exhibit 6.13.
Change request forms typically include several sections. The top section lists basic infor-
mation to track the change request to the project and to the person who submitted it. The
second section contains two simple statements describing the change and why the change
is needed. The third section details the impact expected from the potential change. This
can vary in length from a simple check and comment section, as in Exhibit 6.13, to an
extremely involved description of potential impact on complex system projects such as
designing an aircraft. In complex projects, small changes can sometimes have catastrophic
impacts. Finally, there should be a space for the change to be approved. Regardless of the
complexity and format, the most important consideration is that potential changes must be
submitted and documented whether they are approved or not.
6-6 Using MS Project for Work Breakdown
Structures (WBS)
The WBS is a building block for the remaining detailed project planning tools. This is
the place where the value of software to automate detailed work becomes apparent. Our
coverage of MS Project in this chapter describes how to set up a WBS in MS Project.
EXHIBIT 6.12
STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS AND WBS AT THE CIA
At the CIA where I created and run our agency-wide project management training and certification program, I come in contact
with large numbers of dedicated project managers. With enrollment averaging about 2,500 students per year, I encounter a work-
force with a broad spectrum of experiences, skills, and expectations. One of the more prevalent expectations is associated with
stakeholder analysis and communication; employees invariably feel that they pretty much know most or all they need to know in
this area and may even begrudge somewhat the three days associated with our Project Communications Management course.
What they discover, is the shortcomings in their appreciation for and knowledge about project communications. Using a five-
point Likert scale, we have every student perform a self-assessment of their communications proficiency prior to and after the
class. To the students’ surprise, proficiency increases average a full point; student feedback virtually always includes statements to
the effect that they didn’t realize just how much more effective they can be in project management by investing more in the proj-
ect communications area.
The organizational chart plays a central role in how the CIA approaches the analysis of stakeholders. Employees learn
through classroom exercises to use the organizational chart as a roadmap for identifying the stakeholders. As they march
through the branches in this chart, they make conscious decisions about whether the function represented by the title or
box on the chart or whether the individual performing that function is a stakeholder. Once they have identified the stake-
holders and performed the associated stakeholder analysis, they then turn to the WBS to help with the planning and
implementation of the communications tasks that follow. In fact, communications for the types of projects undertaken at
the CIA have taken on such importance that we advocate it be placed at the first level of WBS decomposition alongside
equally important components such as project management. For projects of sufficient size, a full-time leader is often
assigned to the communications component; the scope of their duties includes communications within the project as well
as communications outside the project.

Part 2 Planning Projects

6-6a Set Up the WBS
Setting up the WBS has five steps, as follows:
1. Understand WBS definitions and displays.
2. Enter summaries.
3. Create the outline for your WBS.
4. Insert row number column.
5. Hide (or show) the desired amount of detail.
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND WBS DEFINITIONS AND DISPLAYS MS Project refers to
WBS elements as summary tasks or summaries. Summaries are displayed:
•
In tables as an outline, with summary tasks in bold. MS Project uses only the in-
dented outline format to display a WBS.
•
In a Gantt view with different graphic shapes (there are several Gantt views).
Exhibit 6.14 shows a Gantt view of a WBS with the entry table on the left and the
Gantt chart graphic on the right. At this time the Gantt graphic is of little value—
there is no underlying detail with duration values that drive a summary duration
longer than one day.
STEP 2: ENTER WBS ELEMENTS (SUMMARIES) Enter the summaries in the Task
Name column cells as shown in Exhibit 6.15. WBS elements can be added with an insert
function as follows:
1. Click on the Id field to select the row below where the new row will be. Selecting
more than one row will result in that number of blank rows being inserted.
2. On the Task tab, Insert group, click Insert Task.

3. In the Task Name field, enter the name of the added WBS element.
4. Enter any additional summary(s).
STEP 3: CREATE THE OUTLINE FOR YOUR WBS Set up the outline structure using
the Indent and Outdent controls shown in Exhibit 6.16 (these are two separate controls,
appearing as the Task tab green arrows).
1. Click the Task Name field of the row to be indented.
2. On the Task tab, Schedule group, click Indent Task. Indenting a summary row
will also indent its lower-level items. Multiple rows under a summary row can
be indented at the same time by selecting all of them before clicking the
Indent control.
3. To decrease an indent level with the Outdent control: On the Task tab, Schedule
group, click Outdent Task. Any lower-level items will also be outdented.

STEP 5: HIDE (OR SHOW) UNDERLYING DETAIL Some stakeholders will not want to
see lower levels of WBS detail. To display the appropriate level detail, complete one or
both of the following steps:
•
Click Hide Subtasks (minus sign in box before the task name) to hide underlying
detail, or
•
Click Show Subtasks (plus sign in box) to show underlying detail.
In Exhibit 6.19, the underlying detail for the Board Retreats and Site Leader Retreat
WBS elements is hidden.
Summary
Once a project is formally approved by a sponsor rati-
fying its charter, it is time for detailed planning. While
project planning is iterative, normally the first steps are
to identify stakeholders, plan communications, and
determine what will be created on the project. Project
teams start this process by asking customers what end-
of-project deliverables they want. From the customers’
response, the planning team can determine both what
interim deliverables need to be created and what work
needs to be performed to create all of the deliverables.
Just as important as determining what will be produced
during the project is determining what will not be pro-
duced. These boundaries of what will and will not be
included constitute the project’s scope.
Once the scope is defined, it can be organized into
a work breakdown structure (WBS). A WBS is used
to progressively decompose the project into smaller
and smaller pieces until each can be assigned to one
person for planning and control. The WBS serves as a
basis for determining the project schedule, budget,

personnel assignments, quality requirements, and
risks. As those other functions are planned, items
are commonly identified that should be added to
the WBS.
Some teams create their WBS by hand using the org
chart or free format methods, while others directly type
their WBS into project scheduling software such as
Microsoft Project.

Scheduling Projects
The projects I’m regularly involved in these days are for web-based software
implementations.
I
help
clients
with
initial
adoption
and
use
of
our
commercially-available applications. The cost and scope of these projects is
fairly straightforward. Scheduling, however, is not!
Several
problems
make
creating
and
managing
implementation
schedules a challenge. First, decision makers who buy our software and
see its value seldom lead implementations themselves, and they may be
slow to designate project leaders. Once they do, there are often gaps in
communicating project objectives, timelines, and measures of success.
Second, a key success factor is populating the central repository with
adequate quality content to justify the software’s use. There are two different
approaches clients can take when scoping this work effort: schedule-driven
approach—harvest, prepare, and load whatever content is readily available
for
quick
deployment
and
usage—and
scope-driven
approach—define
complete content requirements prior to initial launch.
C H A P T E R
O B J E C T I V E S
After completing this
chapter, you should be
able to:
• Describe five ways in
which a project’s
schedule is limited
and how to deal with
each.
• Describe potential
problems in
estimating time
accurately and how
to overcome them.
• Use the activity on
node (AON) method
to develop a project
schedule.
• Describe how to adjust
a project’s sequence
logic using leads,
lags, and alternative
dependencies.
• Identify the critical
path using both the
two-pass and
enumeration
methods, and identify
all float.
• Depict a project
schedule on a Gantt

and using MS Project

critical path and all

Topics:
• Plan schedule
management
• Define activities
• Sequence activities
• Estimate activity
durations
• Develop schedule
One risk using the second approach is that content development projects
often have schedules with long durations, even when adequately resourced.
The result: Months later, software has still not been adopted due to lack of
content. Sadly, this is all too common in our industry, which is why we place
great importance on a well-defined schedule and resource plan for content
development.
Another critical success factor is users who have learned, retained, and
mastered the skills of working with the software. This should be easy, but
it’s not. Our products are often purchased expressly for people who are
pressed for time, since improved efficiency is a major benefit. Unfortunately,
I see people attend training and then forget everything they’ve learned
because other priorities prevent them from spending the time needed to
practice and master new skills. As a result, training investments go to waste
because learning is not retained.
One solution that has worked well for our customers is establishing a
scope that can be completed in a schedule of four to eight weeks. We
schedule a project kickoff meeting to identify a project leader, tasks, and
timeline. Team members are educated on goals, critical success factors, and
typical issues and challenges. Once gaining consensus on an action plan, I
communicate it to both the project leader and sponsor to ensure alignment.
Then the team and I meet regularly to monitor progress. If there are issues,
we develop plans to resolve them and follow up at subsequent meetings.
Establishing scope that can be accomplished in a 30- to 60-day schedule
helps our clients get started using their web-based applications faster. By
using them, people get motivated. Therefore, customers are more likely to
allocate adequate resources and time to subsequent project phases that
address the full scope of their content and training requirements, no matter
how many months or years that may take. Project planning for the future
becomes more realistic, improving the odds of success. Meanwhile, clients
are achieving return on their software investments.

7-1 Plan Schedule Management
As is true of other project planning areas, planning for time is iterative. A project man-
ager and team usually develop as much of the schedule as they can based upon the
information in the work breakdown structure (WBS). The communication plan, require-
ments traceability matrix, and scope statement are often either complete or at least in
draft form at this point. Once a project is scheduled, the budget can be formulated, re-
source needs can be identified and resources assigned, risks can be identified and plans
developed to deal with the identified risks, and a quality management plan can be cre-
ated. In many projects, these are not all treated as discrete activities, and some of them
may be performed together. However, for clarity, each of these planning processes will be
described individually.
The building blocks of a project schedule are activities. An activity is “a distinct,
scheduled portion of work performed during the course of a project.”1 For activities to
be useful as schedule building blocks, they should have the following characteristics:
•
Clear starting and ending points
•
Tangible output that can be verified
•
Scope small enough to understand and control without micromanaging
•
Labor, other costs, and schedule that can be estimated and controlled
•
A single person who can be held accountable for each activity (even if more than
one person does the work, one person should be responsible)2
Since activities represent work that needs to be performed, they should be listed in a
verb-noun format, such as “prepare budget,” “build frame,” “test code,” “transmit infor-
mation,” “analyze data,” and “develop plan.” Each activity should be clearly differentiated
from other activities, so it is often helpful to write the activities in verb-adjective-noun
format, such as “write draft report” and “write final report.”
The Project Management Institute (PMI) has divided project time management into
the following seven work processes.
1. Plan schedule management—the process of establishing the policies, procedures, and
documentation for planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the
project schedule
2. Define activities—the process of identifying the specific actions that need to be
performed to produce the project deliverables
3. Sequence activities—the process of identifying and documenting dependencies
among the project activities
4. Estimate activity resources—the process of estimating the type and quantities of
material, human resources, equipment, or supplies required to perform each activity
5. Estimate activity durations—the process of approximating the number of work
periods needed to complete individual activities with estimated resources
6. Develop schedule—the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource
requirements, and schedule constraints to create the project schedule
7. Control schedule—the process of monitoring the status of the project activities to
update project progress and managing changes to the schedule baseline to achieve the
plan3
Planning schedule management, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating
activity durations, and part of developing schedules will be covered in this chapter.
Estimating activity resources and the remainder of developing schedules will be discussed
in Chapter 8 (Resourcing Projects). Chapter 14 (Determining Project Progress and
Results) will focus on controlling the schedule.

Part 2 Planning Projects

7-2 Purposes of a Project Schedule
Projects are undertaken to accomplish important business purposes, and people often
want to be able to use the project results as quickly as possible. Many specific questions
such as the following can be answered by having a complete and workable schedule:
•
When will the project be complete?
•
What is the earliest date a particular activity can start, and when will it end?
•
What activity must begin before which other activities can take place?
•
What would happen if a delivery of material was one week late?
•
Can a key worker take a week of vacation the first week of March?
•
If one worker is assigned to do two activities, which one must go first?
•
How many hours do we need from each worker next week or month?
•
Which worker or other resource is a bottleneck, limiting the speed of our project?
•
What will the impact be if the client wants to add another module?
•
If I am willing to spend an extra $10,000, how much faster can the project be
completed?
•
Are all of the activities completed that should be by now?
7-3 Historical Development of Project Schedules
Throughout history, projects have been performed, but many early projects such as
cathedrals in Europe took decades or longer to complete. As competition drove the
need for more rapid completion, systematic methods were developed for scheduling
projects.
In the 1950s, two project scheduling methods were developed: program evaluation
and review technique (PERT) and critical path method. The critical path method
(CPM) is “a method used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the
amount of scheduling flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule
model.”4 Both CPM and PERT were founded on the concepts still in place today of iden-
tifying activities, determining their logical order, and estimating the duration for each.
Networks representing the activities were developed and the schedule calculated. Each
of the techniques also boasted a capability the other did not possess.
PERT was developed in the Navy’s Special Program Office because the Navy was
developing the large and complex Polaris Weapons System. To complete it as quickly
as possible, many activities needed to be worked on simultaneously. Furthermore, many
aspects of the Polaris used unproven technology. There was considerable uncertainty
regarding how long some of the new technology would take to develop. PERT enabled
project managers to estimate the most likely amount of time needed to complete a proj-
ect, and the level of confidence in completing it in a particular time. This has proven to
be useful in research and development projects involving individual activities that are
hard to estimate precisely. How uncertainty in project schedules is handled by PERT
will be discussed more in Section 7.9.
CPM was developed in the Engineering Services Division of DuPont. DuPont needed
to plan large projects when it built and refurbished enormous plants. Planners using
CPM estimated the time for each individual work activity using a single time estimate.
The focus was on understanding the longest sequence of activities, which determined
how long the project would take. CPM enabled project managers to ask what-if ques-
tions such as “If the project needs to be finished three weeks early, which activities
should be speeded up and how much will it cost?” This proved to be useful in the con-
struction industry where delays such as rain often necessitate the acceleration of a
project.
Chapter 7 Scheduling Projects
173

PERT and CPM originally used a method for displaying the work activities called activity
on arrow (AOA) or arrow diagramming method (ADM), in which schedule activities are
represented by arrows and connected at points called nodes. Because it is often confusing to
draw an accurate AOA network, this method is rarely used today. The more common
method used today is called activity on node (AON) or the precedence diagramming
method (PDM). AON or PDM is “a technique in which the scheduled activities are
represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show
the sequence in which the activities are performed.”5 A small project schedule is shown in
Exhibit 7.1 with work activities A through D connected by arrows showing logical
relationships (A must be complete before B and C can begin and both B and C must
finish before D can begin).
The basic logic of these techniques still serves as the backbone of many project sche-
dules today. However, other advances have added to scheduling capability. One is that
since computers are so much more powerful and easier to use, many additional features
have been added to project schedules. Another trend is that with many organizations
operating in a “lean” mode, resource limitations rather than just the logical order of
activities are a major determinant of many project schedules.
7-4 How Project Schedules Are Limited and Created
One way to understand project schedules and how they are constructed is to understand
that five factors may limit how fast a project can be completed:
1. Logical order
2. Activity duration
3. Resource availability
4. Imposed dates
5. Cash flow
The first factor is the logical order in which activities need to be completed. For
example, one needs to dig a hole before cement can be poured in it. This is covered in
the section on sequencing activities. The second factor is how long each individual activ-
ity will take. This is discussed in the section on estimating activity duration. It includes
methods for estimating durations, problems with estimates, and remedies to those pro-
blems. The third factor is how many key resources are available at specific points in the
project. For example, if six rooms were available to be painted at the same time, and
fewer than six painters were available, progress would be slowed. This is discussed in
EXHIBIT 7.1
AON FORMAT SCHEDULE EXAMPLE

Chapter 8 in the section on resource availability. The fourth factor is imposed dates. For
example, a project working on a government contract may not be able to start until the
government’s new fiscal year, which starts on October 1. Chapter 8 also has a section on
imposed dates. The fifth and final factor is cash flow. Projects may not start until money
is approved, but progress may also be slowed until enough revenue arrives to cover
expenses. This is covered in Chapter 9.
Because project schedules are limited by these five factors, creating a realistic schedule
is an iterative process. A common method of developing the schedule is to first identify
all of the activities and then determine the logical order by creating a network diagram.
Once the order is determined, resources are assigned to each activity and an estimate of
the time required for that activity is made. If the assigned resource is not available when
the activity is scheduled, then an adjustment of some type is made. The schedule can be
computed with all of this information. Next, it is time to compare the emerging schedule
with any imposed dates and cash flow estimates. Any inconsistencies may cause the team
to adjust the schedule. Other factors often need to be considered, such as quality
demands and risk factors. When all of these have been planned, the final schedule can be
approved.
The pressure to complete a project as quickly as possible is often great. The sponsor
or customer may try to dictate a schedule before anyone knows whether it is feasible or
not. Before agreeing, the project manager must first understand what makes sense in
terms of a schedule before she is in a position to know whether to accept a sponsor’s
suggestions or to argue about why it may be impractical. A project manager has the
ethical responsibility to determine a schedule that is possible to achieve, persuade all
stakeholders that the schedule makes sense, and then see to it that the project is deliv-
ered according to that agreed-upon schedule.
The remainder of this chapter and the other planning chapters describe in detail how
to plan each of these, culminating in an approved schedule and project plan that all
stakeholders believe is reasonable. The project manager is then accountable to deliver
the project on schedule. That project delivery is the essence of the final four chapters of
this book.
7-5 Define Activities
The first process in developing a project schedule is to define all of the work activities.
The last row of a WBS represents the work packages—lowest-level deliverables. Now is
the time to ask, “What work activities must be completed to create each of the project
deliverables?” Exhibit 7.2 shows a WBS with the deliverables identified by numbers 1
through 9, and Exhibit 7.3 shows the same project with the activities required to create
the deliverables listed. Notice that project management is the first section of the WBS
and that each row in both exhibits has a unique number. The number of each activity
shows the deliverable it helps to create. For example, activity 4.2, contact local bands, is
needed for deliverable 3, entertainment.
As teams define activities, they want to be careful not to omit any. It is a good idea
to have someone on your project team play devil’s advocate to challenge the team to
identify additional activities. It is better to identify activities that do not need to be
accomplished than to forget activities that will need to be added later. The team may
think all of the activities have been identified; however, when the next process is
performed—activity sequencing—it may become obvious that some activities have been
forgotten. Another activity can always be added later. Remember the schedule will not be
approved until all of the related planning is in place. It is better to discover a missing
activity in the later stages of planning than after the schedule is approved. Activities that
Chapter 7 Scheduling Projects
175

need to be added after the final schedule is approved will add time and money to the proj-
ect, perhaps driving it over budget and causing it to fall behind schedule.
If the project being planned is similar to previous projects, the team can look at those
projects both for defining activities and for other planning that follows. Some organiza-
tions have templates or checklists for certain types of projects that can be used as a start-
ing point in defining activities. Regardless of the starting point, team members need to
keep asking how this project is different from previous ones. Often, a new project
includes a few unique activities that need to be included.
In addition to the activity list, the project milestones should be listed. A milestone is
an important point in a project schedule that the project sponsor and manager want to
use as a checkpoint. A few major milestones are often identified in the project charter,
but quite commonly more milestones are identified during project schedule planning.
Common milestones include completion of a major deliverable, completion of a critical
activity, and the time just before a large amount of money needs to be committed to the
project. A team may also decide to put a milestone at a merging point in the project
schedule where multiple activities need to be complete before progress can continue.
The common denominator in each of these decisions is to identify a few key points in
the life of a project where management can determine if the project is progressing the
way they want. A milestone list is shown in Exhibit 7.4. Note that the line numbers
assigned to the milestones are one greater than the line numbers of the activities that
must be completed for each milestone. For example, the milestone “Information needs
finalized” (item 3.6) represents the point in time that all of the information-related activ-
ities (items 3.1 through 5.5) are completed. For clarity, items 3.1 through 3.5 have been
imported from Exhibit 7.3 and set in a lighter font. Notice also that the verb choice on
the milestones is past tense, such as “confirmed,” “finalized,” and so on. This indicates
that the activities leading up to each milestone must be complete.
7-6 Sequence Activities
Once the activities have been identified, it is time to determine the logical order in which
they can be accomplished. A common method of determining this sequence is to put
each defined activity on a Post-it Note and to display them on a large work space (white
board, several flip chart sheets on a wall, etc.). The activities that are expected to be
accomplished early in the project can be placed on the left portion of the work surface,
those activities expected to be accomplished midway in the project near the middle, and
those expected to be last on the right. Then, one person can serve as a facilitator asking,

“What activity or activities can be started right away and do not depend on any others?”
Once one or more of these initial activities have been identified, the facilitator asks,
“What activity or activities can we start now?” The initial activity is called a predecessor
activity, which is “an activity that logically comes before a dependent activity in a
schedule.”6 The following activity is called a successor activity, which is “a dependent
activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule.”7 The facilitator then
places the successor activity after its predecessor and draws an arrow to show the rela-
tionship. The team continues with this analysis until all activities have been placed on
the work surface with arrows showing the predecessor–successor relationships. At that
time, the team should mentally go through the network to ensure that no “dead-ends”
are present where the chain of arrows from the project start to end is broken.
Exhibits 7.5 and 7.6 illustrate sequencing activities with the simple example of
upgrading a product. The activities are identified in Exhibit 7.5, and their sequence is
shown in Exhibit 7.6. The first activity is to determine the product features. As soon as
that is done, two other activities can be performed.
This product upgrade example illustrates the basic logic of showing predecessor–
successor dependency relationships. Dependencies can be either mandatory or discre-
tionary. A mandatory dependency is “a relationship that is contractually required or

inherent in the nature of the work.”8 A discretionary dependency is “a relationship
that is established based on knowledge of best practices… where a specific sequence is
desired.”9 A mandatory example is “the hole must be dug before concrete can be
poured into it” and a discretionary example is “past experience tells us it is better to
delay designing product graphics until the marketing plan is complete.” The team
needs to include all of the mandatory dependencies and use its judgment on which
discretionary dependencies to include. Most teams include no more dependencies
than necessary since more dependencies give the project manager fewer choices as the
project progresses.
7-6a Leads and Lags
Exhibit 7.6 shows the most common type of logical dependency, finish-to-start (FS),
which is “a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a prede-
cessor activity has finished.”10 That means, in this example, that the marketing plan must
be completely designed before the graphics design starts. However, maybe the graphics
design could start five work days before the marketing campaign design is complete.
This could be modeled as a lead, which is “the amount of time whereby a successor
activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity.”11 With this lead of five
work days, the arrow connecting design marketing campaign and design graphics would

still represent a finish-to-start relationship, only with a five-day overlap during which
time people could work on both activities. Leads are helpful if a project needs to be com-
pleted quickly since they show how a successor activity can be overlapped with its prede-
cessor instead of waiting until the predecessor is completely finished.
Perhaps in the example, the sales people are more effective if the design graphics are
completed 10 days before they start performing sales calls so they have extra time to bet-
ter understand the graphics. This could be shown by a lag, “the amount of time whereby
a successor activity is required to be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity.”12 In
this example, the arrow connecting design graphics and perform sales calls would still
represent a finish-to-start relationship, only with a 10-day gap during which no one
could work on either activity.
7-6b Alternative Dependencies
Other types of relationships exist besides finish-to-start, including the following:
•
Finish-to-finish (FF) is “a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot
finish until a predecessor activity has finished.”13 For example, perhaps the graphics
could be designed while the marketing campaign is being designed, but could not be
completed until the marketing campaign is completed.
•
Start-to-start (SS) is “a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start
until a predecessor activity has started.”14 For example, perhaps the graphics design
could not start until the design marketing campaign started.

•
Start-to-finish (SF) is “a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot
finish until a predecessor activity has started.”15 This is the least used relationship.
An example is for a project to replace an old system where the new capability must
be started before the old one is completely discontinued.
7-7 Estimate Activity Duration
Once the activities have been defined and sequenced, both estimating activity resources
and estimating activity durations can take place. Duration is “the total number of work
periods (not including holidays or other nonwork periods) required to complete a sched-
ule activity, usually expressed as workdays or workweeks.”16
It makes sense to identify the people who will work on each activity as soon as
possible since they often have the most knowledge about how to actually do the
work and how long it will take. Also, the length of time to perform an activity is
often dependent upon who will do that work. We discuss resource assignments in
Chapter 8.
When estimating how long activities are expected to take, each activity should be
evaluated independently. All assumptions and constraints made when estimating
should be documented since if one of these changes, it could change the estimate.
For the first estimate of each activity, a normal level of labor and equipment and a
normal work week should be assumed. If overtime is planned right from the start,
the project manager is unlikely to have much flexibility if the schedule needs to be
accelerated. For each activity, the output to be created and the skill level required to
perform the work should be identified. Any predetermined completion date can be
disregarded at this point. Negotiation with a customer or supplier may be necessary,
but the project manager needs to understand what is reasonable under normal circum-
stances before entering those negotiations. When a past project is being used as a
guide, the actual time it took to perform the activities should be used, not the time
that was initially estimated.
Exhibit 7.7 is a continuation of the product upgrade example with the times estimated
for individual activities. Note that the estimated times in this example are in work days.
It is important to keep time estimates in the same unit of measure, be it hours, days,
weeks, or another measure. Exhibit 7.8 includes suggestions for creating realistic time
estimates.

7-7a Problems and Remedies in Duration Estimating
Many factors can impact the accuracy of activity duration estimates. A list of potential
problems, remedies for those problems, and the chapter in which each is discussed is
shown in Exhibit 7.9. These techniques are not mutually exclusive. Many organizations
use several of them; however, few organizations use them all. It is important for business
students to be aware of these techniques and their potential benefits, since each is used
by some companies. Many companies customize the mechanics of how they use these
techniques.
7-7b Learning Curves
The concept behind learning curves is simple: The more times a person performs an
activity, the better and faster he or she becomes. The reason this concept is sometimes
applied to activity duration estimating is that the rate of improvement can be studied
and predicted. Therefore, on types of projects where certain activities are performed
many times, a project planner can predict how long it will take each time to perform
the activity. The rate of improvement can vary widely depending on many factors,
such as:
•
How much the culture of the organization stresses continual improvement
•
How much skill is involved in the activity
•
How complex that activity is
•
How much of the activity is dependent on the worker versus dictated by the pace of
a machine
EXHIBIT 7.8
SUGGESTIONS FOR CREATING REALISTIC TIME ESTIMATES
1.
Verify all time estimations with the people doing the work. Or, even better, have the people doing the work provide the
initial estimates of the activity completion time.
2.
Estimate times of completion of work without initial reference to a calendar. Just consider how long you believe each
activity will take under normal working conditions.
3.
Make sure all time units are identical: work days, work weeks, months (consider time off for company holidays), or
another measure.
4.
Some people tend to estimate optimistically. Keep in mind the following time constraints:
• Unexpected meetings
• Learning curves
• Competing priorities
• Vacation
• Resources or information not available on time
• Inaccuracy in work instructions
• Interruptions
• Emergencies and illness
• Rework
5.
Contrary to point 4, some people estimate pessimistically in order to look good when they bring their project or activities
in under budget and under schedule. Try to develop an understanding of the estimator’s experience along with their
optimistic or pessimistic tendencies and try to encourage balance in estimates.
6.
Don’t initially worry about who is going to do the work, and don’t worry about the mandatory deadline. Figure out a
realistic estimate first, and then figure out what to cut later.
7.
When using the actual time from a previous project, adjust the estimate up or down based upon size, familiarity, and
complexity differences.
182
Part 2 Planning Projects

The amount of time necessary to perform an activity is calculated based upon a rate
of improvement that occurs every time the number of repetitions doubles. For example,
if the learning rate is 80 percent and the first time the activity was performed (by pro-
ducing the first unit) it took 100 minutes, then after doubling the volume, the second
unit would require 80 minutes. To double the repetitions again, the fourth unit would
require 64 minutes. The time estimates for each time the activity is performed can be
found in learning curve tables such as the one shown in Exhibit 7.10. Notice that the
rate of learning is very important since more rapid learning leads to much faster perfor-
mance times for succeeding times an activity is performed.

For consumers, one result when an industry has a steep learning curve is rapidly declining
prices. People expect prices to decline for new electronics and other consumer items. As a
project manager, you need to make sure to also plan for the amount of learning that may
take place. Further, as a project manager, you need to create and sustain the environment
that encourages and expects rapid learning so you can become ever more competitive.
On agile projects, duration estimates improve as early iterations are completed.
Armed with more specific knowledge of how long certain activities take, later iterations
can be estimated more accurately. However, since the estimates are for a specific dura-
tion of generally two- or four-week iterations, the estimate is for velocity “a measure of
a team’s productivity rate at which deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted
within a predetermined interval.”17 This means the project manager estimates how
much can get done in the next iteration.
7-8 Develop Project Schedules
You need to complete all of the scheduling processes discussed up to this point even if
you use Microsoft Project or another scheduling tool. At this point, you have defined,
sequenced, and estimated the duration for all the schedule activities. Now is the time to
use all of this information to develop a project schedule. Once the schedule is developed
based upon this information, resource needs and availability and cash flow constraints
often extend the proposed schedule, while imposed date constraints often suggest the
need for schedule compression.
The first major task in developing the project schedule is to identify the critical path,
which is “the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through the project,
which determines the shortest possible duration.”18 Because it is the longest sequence of
activities, the critical path determines the earliest possible end date of the project. Any
time change to an activity on the critical path changes the end date of the entire project.
If the project manager changes an activity on the critical path to start at a later date, then
the whole project will end at a later date. If the amount of work for an activity on the
critical path is increased, then the whole project will end at a later date. If, on the other
hand, an activity on the critical path is performed faster than planned, the entire project
could be completed sooner. The critical path gets its name not because it is the most
critical in terms of cost, technical risk, or any other factor, but because it is most critical
in terms of time. Since virtually everyone wants her projects completed at the promised
time, the critical path gets a great deal of attention.
The two methods for determining the critical path are the two-pass and enumeration
methods. Each uses the same activity identification, duration estimate, and activity
sequencing data but processes the data in a different manner. While both determine the
critical path, each also determines other useful information.

7-8a Two-Pass Method
The two-pass method is used to determine the amount of slack each activity has. To per-
form this method, two logical passes should be made through the network. The first pass
is called the forward pass. The forward pass is “a critical path method technique for
calculating the early start and early finish dates by working forward through the schedule
model from the project start.”19 On the forward pass, the project team starts at the
beginning of the project and asks how soon each activity can begin and end. If the proj-
ect is being scheduled with software, actual calendar dates are used. Often, when calcu-
lating the schedule by hand, a team starts at date zero. In other words, the first activity
can begin after zero days. To envision this, consider Exhibit 7.11, where all of the previ-
ously determined information has been displayed.
A legend is shown in the lower right corner of Exhibit 7.11. This explains each bit of
information that is displayed for each activity. For example, the first activity name is
“Determine new product features.” The estimated duration for this activity is five days.
This activity is coded with the letter A. The four corners of each block display four
important times for each activity:
•
Early start date (ES)—“the earliest possible point in time on which uncompleted
portions of a schedule activity can start, based upon the schedule network logic, the
data date, and any schedule constraints.”20
•
Early finish date (EF)—“the earliest possible point in time on which uncompleted
portions of a schedule activity can finish, based upon the schedule network logic, the
data date, and any schedule constraints.”21

Late start date (LS)—“the latest possible point in time in which uncompleted
portions of a schedule activity can start, based upon the schedule network logic, the
project completion date, and any schedule constraints.”22
•
Late finish date (LF)—“the latest possible point in time when the uncompleted
portions of a schedule activity can finish based upon the network logic, the project
completion date, and any schedule constraints.”23
“Determine new product features,” for example, has an early start time of zero since it
can begin as soon as the project is authorized.
FIRST OR FORWARD PASS The first pass is then used to calculate the early finish,
which is the early start plus the estimated duration (ES + Duration = EF). In this case,
0 + 5 = 5 means the activity “Determine new product features” can be completed after
five days. Each activity that is a successor can start as soon as its predecessor activity is
complete. Therefore, the next two activities can each start after five days. To calculate the
early finish for each of these activities, add its duration to the early start of 5, for early
completion times of 25 and 15, respectively. The difficult part of calculating the first pass
comes when an activity has more than one predecessor. For example, “Perform sales
calls” cannot begin until all three preceding activities (“Produce prototypes,” “Design gra-
phics,” and “Conduct marketing”) are complete. Therefore, its early start is 45. This is
true even though “Produce prototypes” and “Design graphics” have earlier finish times,
because “Conduct marketing” cannot be completed until day 45. The later time is always
taken. The results of the first pass are shown in Exhibit 7.12. Note that the earliest the
entire project can be completed is 70 work days.

SECOND OR BACKWARD PASS The second pass is sometimes called the backward
pass. The backward pass is “a critical path method technique for calculating the late
start and late finish dates by working backward through the schedule model from the
project end date.”24 When performing the backward pass, teams start at the end and
work backward asking, “How late can each activity be finished and started?” Unless there
is an imposed date, the late finish for the last activity during planning is the same as the
early finish date. In our example, we know the earliest we can finish the entire project is
70 days, so we will use that as the late finish date for the last activity. If the activity “Per-
form sales calls” must end no later than 70 and it takes 25 days, then it must start no
later than day 45. In other words, calculate the late start by subtracting the duration
from the late finish (LF – duration = LS). The confusing part of calculating the second
pass is when there is more than one successor. In Exhibit 7.13, one place this occurs at
the first activity, “Determine new product features,” since two activities are immediate
successors. Enough time must be left for all of the successors, so whichever one must
start soonest dictates the late finish date of the predecessor. In this example, “Design
marketing campaign” must start no later than after day 5; therefore, five days is the late
finish for the first activity.
FLOAT AND THE CRITICAL PATH Once both passes are complete, the early and late
start dates for every activity and the amount of time the entire project will take to com-
plete are known. However, the team also wants to know the critical path. This is calcu-
lated easily by first determining each activity’s float (sometimes float is called slack).

Float can be total float, which is “the amount of time a schedule activity may be delayed
or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date”25 or free
float, which is “the amount of time a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying
the early start of any successor.”26 A project manager wants to know how much float
each activity has in order to determine where to spend her time and attention. Activities
with a great deal of float can be scheduled in a flexible manner and do not cause a man-
ager much concern. Activities with no float or very little float, on the other hand, need to
be scheduled very carefully.
Float is calculated by the equation Float = Late start – Early start (Float = LS – ES).
The critical path is the sequence of activities from start to finish in the network that have
no float. In Exhibit 7.14, activities A, D, F, and G have no float and, therefore, create the
critical path. It is typical to mark the critical path in red or in boldface to call attention
to it. Activities B, C, and E each have float and are not on the critical path. If activity B is
delayed, it will delay the start of activity C; therefore, activity B has total float. While
activity B can be delayed up to 10 days without delaying the entire project, any delay to
activity B would delay the start of activity C. On the other hand, activities C and E can
be delayed by 10 and 20 days, respectively, without causing any other activity to be
delayed. Therefore, their float is free float—impacting neither the overall project nor
any activity in it.
Project managers carefully monitor the critical path activities. They also closely watch
activities with little float—think of these as “near-critical” activities. A project with many

activities that have little float is not very stable. Even small delays on near-critical activi-
ties can change the critical path. Project managers can sometimes “borrow” resources
from an activity with plenty of float to use first on an activity that is either already criti-
cal or nearly critical. Chapter 8 discusses resource scheduling in detail.
7-8b Enumeration Method
The second method of determining the critical path is the enumeration method. To
complete this, a person lists or enumerates all of the paths through the network. The
advantage of this method is that since all of the paths are identified and timed, if a
team needs to compress the project schedule, they will know both the critical path and
the other paths that may be nearly critical (or those with very little float). It is imperative
to keep track of both critical and near-critical paths when compressing a schedule. In
Exhibit 7.15, three paths are identified, and the total duration for each is calculated.
ADFG is the critical path with an expected duration of 70 days, just as was determined
with the two-pass method. Now, however, we also know that path ABCG is expected to
take 60 days (10 less than the critical path), and path ADEG is expected to take 50 days
(20 less than the critical path).

7-9 Uncertainty in Project Schedules
On some projects, it is easy to estimate durations of activities with confidence. On
others, so many uncertainties exist that managers have far less confidence in their ability
to accurately estimate. However, project managers still need to tell sponsors and clients
how long they believe a project will take and then be held accountable for meeting those
dates. One common strategy for handling this potential problem is to construct the best
schedule possible and then manage the project very closely. A different strategy is to
estimate a range of possible times each individual activity may take and then see what
impact that has on the entire schedule. PERT and Monte Carlo are two methods some-
times used for this approach.
7-9a Program Evaluation and Review Technique
Program evaluation and review technique was developed during the 1950s to better
understand how variability in the individual activity durations impacts the entire project
schedule. To use PERT, a project team starts by sequencing the activities into a network
as described above. However, instead of creating one estimate for the time to complete
each activity, they would create three estimates: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic.
For example, the first activity, “Determine new product features,” will most likely take
five days, but it could take as little as four days if everything works well and as long as
12 days if a variety of things interfere. The person scheduling the project then calculates
the estimated time to perform each activity as shown in Exhibit 7.16 using the following
equation:
Estimated time ¼ Optimistic þ 4 ðMost likelyÞ þ Pessimistic
6
Therefore; for the first activity; the estimated time ¼ 4 þ 4ð5Þ þ 12
6
¼ 6
The primary advantage of PERT is that it helps everyone realize how much uncer-
tainty exists in the project schedule. When people use single time estimates, sometimes
there is a tendency to believe that the estimates foretell exactly what will happen. On
many projects, a great deal of uncertainty exists, and PERT helps to make this visible.

Part 2 Planning Projects

In addition to making the overall uncertainty more visible, calculations often show that
the expected time is actually longer than the most likely time. That is because if many
things go very well on an activity, generally only a little time can be saved, but if many
things go terribly wrong, a great deal of time can be lost.
However, using PERT involves difficulties. First, it is often hard enough to create one
estimate of how long an activity will take, so it takes even more effort (and therefore
money) to create three estimates. Second, there is no guarantee on how good any of the
three estimates are. Third, PERT can underestimate the risk of a schedule running long
because it does not accurately address when two or more activities both need to be
accomplished before a third one can begin.27
Since PERT highlights uncertainty in project duration, its logic is useful to project man-
agers. However, since it has some problems, only a few project managers actually use it to
fully calculate and monitor project schedules. Some project managers informally use three
time estimates for a few key activities on the critical path to get a sense for the amount of
uncertainty and to better understand the activities that need close monitoring. Other proj-
ect managers who want to understand the potential variation use Monte Carlo simulation.
Students of project management need to be aware that both PERT and Monte Carlo simu-
lations are sometimes used to help understand uncertainty in project schedules.
7-9b Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is “a process which generates hundreds of thousands of probable
performance outcomes based on probability distributions for cost and schedule on individual
tasks. The outcomes are then used to generate a probability distribution for the project as a
whole.”28 Monte Carlo is more flexible than PERT, in that an entire range of possible time
estimates can be used for any activity. The project schedule is calculated many times (per-
haps 1,000 or more), and each time the estimate for a particular activity is generated based
upon the likelihood of that time as determined by the project manager. For example, suppose
a project manager estimated that for a particular activity there was a 10 percent chance of
taking five days, a 30 percent chance of taking six days, a 40 percent chance of taking seven
days, and the remaining 20 percent chance of taking eight days. Then for each 100 times the
computer generated a project schedule, when it came to that activity, 10 times it would
choose five days, 30 times it would choose six days, 40 times it would choose seven days,
and 20 times it would choose eight days. The output from the computer would include a
distribution of how often the project would be expected to take each possible length of
time. Many other possible outputs can also be generated from Monte Carlo simulations.
One advantage of Monte Carlo analysis is the flexibility it provides. This allows more
realistic estimates. Another advantage is the extent of information it can provide regard-
ing individual activities, the overall project, and different paths through the project that
may become critical.
A disadvantage of Monte Carlo is the amount of time necessary to estimate not just a
most likely duration for each activity, but an entire range of possible outcomes. Another
disadvantage is that special software and skill are necessary to effectively use Monte
Carlo. This disadvantage is not as large as it once was because more software is available
and most students are learning at least the fundamentals of simulation in statistics or
operations classes.
A project manager needs to decide when some of the more specialized techniques are
worth the extra effort for a project. The old saying that a person should spend $100 to
save $1,000, but should not spend $1,000 to save $100 applies. If the savings on a project
from using techniques such as learning curves, PERT, or Monte Carlo are significant,
project managers should consider using one of them. If not, they should create the best
estimates possible without the specialized techniques, incorporate risk management by
Chapter 7 Scheduling Projects
191

carefully identifying and planning for specific risks as discussed in Chapter 10, and man-
age the project schedule very carefully as discussed in Chapter 14.
These specialized techniques are sometimes used in research and development
(R&D) projects. However, some R&D projects do not need this level of sophistication.
Exhibit 7.17 shows an actual R&D project schedule used by D. D. Williamson of Louis-
ville, Kentucky, when a Chinese customer asked it to develop a new product somewhat
different from any it had previously developed. Once D. D. Williamson decided to take
the job, it developed and communicated the project schedule to all stakeholders both in
its company and the customer’s company within the first week.
Australian researchers have discovered that two primary causes of late delivery of IT
projects are variance in time to complete individual work activities and multiple depen-
dencies for some activities. Suggestions for overcoming these two problems are shown in
Exhibit 7.18.
7-10 Show the Project Schedule on a Gantt Chart
The discussion in this chapter so far has been how to determine the project schedule.
While this is necessary, it can be confusing to show people a network diagram. A much
easier to understand tool for communicating a project schedule is a Gantt or bar chart. A
Gantt chart is “a bar chart of schedule information where activities are listed on the ver-
tical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as
horizontal bars placed according to start and end dates.”29
The Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart showing each activity’s early start and finish.
The simplest Gantt charts show a bar for each activity stretched out over a time line.
Many stakeholders also want to see which activities are critical and the amount of float
noncritical activities have. Therefore, critical activities are normally shown in red or
boldface, noncritical activities are normally shown in blue or normal face, and the amount
of float is shown in a muted or thin line out to the late finish of each noncritical activity.
The units of time are the units the project team used in creating the schedule, whether that
is hours, days, weeks, or another measure A Gantt chart is shown in Exhibit 7.19. It is easy

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE IN CHINA EXAMPLE
Week one—Request is received from the customer for a product that is darker than anything we have in our current offering.
Our sales manager forwards the request to our VP sales and our R&D department. A quick review of the potential price versus
cost of materials is completed by the VP sales (with finance input), and the product is deemed saleable at an acceptable margin.
Week two—A trial cook in our “baby cooker” is conducted by our R&D department. Within two attempts, a product that is
within the customer-requested specs is produced. An additional trial is conducted to quickly check repeatability. The trial product
is express shipped to the customer and to our China facility for comparison purposes.
Week three—The formulation and related instructions for cooking are communicated to our China operations with a “red sheet”
process. China has anticipated the receipt of this red sheet, and is able to schedule time in production within a week.
Week four—The initial red sheet production is successful and passes the specification tests in China and in Louisville.
Week five—Customer confirms purchase order, and the first shipment is sent. The product contributes significantly to the reven-
ues and profitability of the China facility. Success!
Key factors—Strong communication between all the players and a clear understanding of the customer expectations up front.

to understand when each activity should be performed. However, the basic Gantt chart
does not show other useful information such as predecessor–successor relationships, late
start dates, and so forth. These can all be easily displayed on a Gantt chart that is devel-
oped using scheduling software such as Microsoft Project. The instructions for using MS
Project to create and print Gantt charts are covered in the following section.

to construct schedules by considering each of these limitations in order. That is, first the
logical order is determined, and then duration estimates are applied. It is often helpful to
confirm the logical order first because if people also apply the estimated durations right
away, MS Project generates dates that may not please some decision makers. You may
secure approval of a more realistic schedule if you allow people to first concentrate on
the order of work and then on how long each activity takes.
This section begins with setting up the project schedule. Then logical order and activ-
ity duration estimates are included in the section on building the network diagram.
Finally, this section covers understanding the critical path and displaying and printing
the emerging schedule. Resource limits and imposed dates are shown in Chapter 8, and
cash flow is shown in Chapter 9.
7-11a Set Up the Project Schedule
Setting up the project schedule includes defining your organization’s holidays, turning
off the change highlighting function, and understanding data types.
DEFINE YOUR ORGANIZATION’S HOLIDAYS MS Project has a calendar system to
define working and nonworking time: a default project calendar and a resource calendar
for each resource. To avoid unrealistic schedules, you must define holidays in the project
calendar and resource vacations in resource calendars. The default project calendar has
all days, except Saturday and Sunday, defined as eight-hour working days. The working
hours during the day are 8:00 to 12:00 and 1:00 to 5:00. No holidays are defined. Holi-
days are blocked out by defining holidays as nonworking days. All project calendar con-
tent is copied into all resource calendars. Resource calendars are used to block out
vacation days and other resource-specific nonworking days. Resource calendars are then
used to determine when a resource assignment can be scheduled. If there is no resource
assignment, then the project calendar is used to determine scheduling.
Use the following steps to change a working day to nonworking, as shown in
Exhibit 7.20. The legend explains the day shading:
1. On the Project tab, click Change Working Time.
2. In the For Calendar: box, enter Standard (Project Calendar) if not displayed.
3. Move to the month and year using the scroll bar to the right of the calendar display.
4. Click on the day to change.
5. Click the Exceptions tab, then click an empty row.
6. Enter a description in the Name column.
7. Click another cell in the same row to review the results.
8. Repeat these steps until the organizational holidays are defined.
9. Deleting a row restores the previous definition.
10. Click OK.
To change the working time for a day, as shown in Exhibit 7.21:
1. Select the day, enter a description, and then click Details…
2. Click Working Time and modify the From: and To: values.
3. If you wish to eliminate one set of work times such as morning, select those times
and apply the delete key so only afternoon times are working.
4. Click OK twice.
To change a nonworking day to working:
1. Select the day and click Details…
2. Click Nonworking and click OK twice.

Part 2 Planning Projects

TURN OFF CHANGE HIGHLIGHTING MS Project automatically shows the impact of
any changes you make to a project schedule. While this is useful when managing an
ongoing project, it can be helpful to turn this function off until the project schedule is
baselined (described in Chapter 11).
1. Click the Task tab.
2. On the Format tab, Text Styles, Item to Change, enter Changed Cells.
3. In Background Color, enter White.
4. Click OK.
UNDERSTANDING TYPES OF PROJECT DATA MS Project works with three types of
data: task, resource, and assignment.
TASK DATA Included in this category are two kinds of information using the same dis-
play fields and formats: WBS data and task data. MS Project refers to individual work
activities as tasks and WBS elements as summary rows. MS Project marks these differ-
ently. WBS text is bolded, while task data are not. A WBS graphic is a black bar with
each end hanging down. The default for a critical path task is a red bar, and a blue bar
is used for a noncritical path task. In this book, critical tasks will be shown in color, and
noncritical tasks will be muted grey.

DETAILS DIALOG FOR HALF WORKING DAY

Some WBS element fields contain roll-up data that summarize lower-level elements. For
example, the duration value in a WBS element is the number of working days in the standard
calendar bounded by the start and finish dates for that element. A Gantt chart with WBS and
task data is shown in Exhibit 7.22.
Resource Data While a resource is often a person, sometimes a critical machine is also
defined as a resource. Each resource is described with information required for control.
Resource assignments will be handled in Chapter 8.
Assignment Data Assignment units, work, and cost data are calculated or set when a
resource is assigned to a task. The task duration, work values, and cost values are also
calculated at the time of the assignment. Cost data will be handled in Chapter 9.
7-11b Build the Logical Network Diagram
These instructions build upon those in Chapter 4 for initiating a project and Chapter 6
for setting up a WBS. The six steps to create a realistic logical network diagram in MS
Project are as follows:
1. Enter tasks and milestones.
2. Understand task dependencies.
3. Define dependencies using a task table and mouse.
4. Define or delete a dependency series.
5. Understand network diagram presentation.
6. Verify the accuracy of the network diagram.
196
Part 2 Planning Projects

STEP 1: ENTER TASKS AND MILESTONES Tasks can be added with an insert func-
tion as follows:
1. Click on the Id field to select the row below where the new row will be.
2. On the Task tab, Insert group, click Insert Task.
3. In the Task Name field, enter the desired name of the added task. WBS elements
(summaries) can also be inserted, one to each row.
4. If both summaries and tasks are inserted, capture all task rows under a summary with
mouse and choose indent (right arrow) to show them as tasks within a summary.
5. Selecting more than one row results in that number of blank rows being inserted.
6. Enter any additional task(s) as above.
7. Inserted rows assume the summary level of the row above the insert location.
STEP 2: UNDERSTAND TASK DEPENDENCIES A task dependency definition includes
both a logical link type (finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, or start-to-finish)
and any associated lead or lag value. The default link type is finish-to-start. The default
lead or lag value is zero days. Both of these defaults were used in the product upgrade
example earlier in this chapter. Task dependencies may be established and viewed graph-
ically in the Network Diagram view and in several Gantt views (Detail Gantt, Gantt
Chart, Leveling Gantt, and Tracking Gantt).
STEP 3: DEFINE DEPENDENCIES USING A TASK TABLE AND MOUSE Dependen-
cies can easily be defined using the following four steps.
1. Click on the Id (task name) field to select the predecessor task row.
2. Press and hold Ctl while selecting the successor task.

3. On the Task tab, Schedule group, click on Link Tasks (chain icon).
4. Delete a dependency definition by again selecting both tasks, and then on the Task
tab, Schedule group, clicking on Unlink Tasks (broken chain icon).
STEP 4: DEFINE OR DELETE A DEPENDENCY SERIES A series of dependencies can
be easily defined by the following three steps.
1. Select (by dragging) all of the tasks to be linked in a series.
2. On the Task tab, Schedule group, click on Link Tasks.
3. Delete the links in a set of tasks by selecting the tasks, and on the Task tab, Schedule
group, clicking on Unlink Tasks.
STEP 5: UNDERSTAND NETWORK DIAGRAM PRESENTATION The project network
diagram is presented in the conventional Network Diagram view. This view shows all
tasks, milestones, and WBS elements (summaries) as described in the following steps
and shown in Exhibit 7.23.
1. On the Task tab, View group, click the arrow and then enter Network Diagram.
2. On the File tab, click Print, then choose appropriate settings and click the Print
control.
Because of the space required by this format, it is best to print the view on a large
paper size. The logical links can also be seen in Gantt Chart view as link lines connecting
Gantt bars, as shown in Exhibit 7.23.
STEP 6: VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF THE NETWORK DIAGRAM The following steps
are useful when verifying the accuracy of the network diagram.
1. Print the network diagram.
2. Find all tasks with no predecessor and justify each.
3. Find all tasks with no successor and justify each.
4. Verify the logic (work flow).
5. Look for opportunities to do activities in parallel or to at least overlap activities.
6. Justify or repair any gaps in the critical path.

Network diagrams will be easier to understand if all logical links are between tasks
and not between tasks and summary bars.
7-11c Understand the Critical Path
Once the logic of the network is confirmed, it is time to develop and understand the
critical path. This is accomplished by first assigning duration estimates and then by
instructing MS Project to identify the critical path.
ASSIGN DURATION ESTIMATES The first principle to keep in mind is to use the
same unit of time for each task. Mixing up hours, days, or weeks will probably create
confusion. The default time unit is days, so these instructions use days. The second prin-
ciple is to only assign duration estimates to tasks and milestones. Milestones consume
zero time; they reflect a moment in time when something is complete. MS Project calcu-
lates the duration for WBS summaries based upon the durations selected for the tasks
that comprise each summary.
To assign the duration to a task, click the Duration cell of the task and enter the
duration value. If days are being used, an adjustment can be made up or down with the
arrows. A number can also be deleted and then another number typed in the cell. If
using hours or weeks, simply type the number and then “h” for hour or “w” for weeks.
If a milestone needs to be shown, zero duration should be assigned to it. To create a
milestone, enter zero in the Duration cell of the milestone.
IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL PATH In most graphical task views, MS Project marks Gantt
bars of critical path tasks and network diagram task nodes in red. But, as shipped, MS
Project does not display the critical path marking on the Gantt Chart graphical view.
This marking is easily added. To do so, click the Task tab and then on the Format tab,
Bar Styles group, click Critical Tasks.
7-11d Display and Print Schedules with MS Project
In the contemporary work environment, many people are accustomed to e-mailing work
associates a file and having the associate open the file to read it. This works very well
with word processing and spreadsheets. Often, it does not work with project scheduling
software, however, because in many organizations only a few people have copies of the
software. Therefore, it is useful to be able to create an output that can be saved as a PDF
or printed and easily read.
A Microsoft Project schedule example is shown in Exhibit 7.22. Several things can be
noted in this example. First, the critical path is clearly highlighted. Second, calendar
dates are used, and the weekends are shown in grey with no work scheduled. Third, the
activities are listed in a WBS with WBS code shown in the left-most column. The overall
project and each summary level are shown by a black bar. Using page setup, timescale,
and a bit of editing, it is easy to create a schedule people can understand. As an older
reviewer of project schedules, your author adheres to the 40-40 rule of schedule displays.
More than 40 lines per page should not be shown if anyone who needs to read it is over
40 years old! Some people even insist on no more than 35 rows per page. This will help
keep your sponsor and clients happy.
Summary
Project schedules are created by listing all of the activi-
ties that need to be performed. This information
should be derived from the work packages at the lowest
level of the work breakdown structure. Each work
package may require one or more activities to be com-
pleted to create the required deliverable. Each activity

needs to be defined in enough detail that it can be
assigned to one person who can accurately determine
how it will be accomplished and by whom, estimate
how long it will take and how much it will cost, and
then be held accountable to ensure it is accomplished.
Once all of the activities have been defined, they
need to be sequenced—that is, the team must deter-
mine which activities must go first (predecessors) and
which activities depend on others to be accomplished
before they can start (successors). Many people find
that determining these relationships is easiest with
Post-it Notes and a large work space.
A person on the planning team needs to estimate how
long each activity will take. This is greatly dependent on
who will do the work, which is discussed in the next chap-
ter. Care should be taken when creating the estimates since
some people tend to be optimistic and many things can
interfere with the ability to work on a specific activity.
Other people tend to pessimistically pad their estimates
to make sure they can finish early and look good.
The three time management processes described
above—activity definition, activity sequencing, and
activity duration estimating—need to be accomplished
even if scheduling software will be used. The next step
is schedule development. Some teams use Post-it Notes
to develop this schedule manually by making two logi-
cal passes through the network to determine both the
earliest and latest any activity can be started and ended.
However, this requires tedious calculations and is
greatly simplified by use of software such as MS
Project.
Schedule development is an iterative process. Once
an initial schedule is developed, it needs to be com-
pared to resource limits, imposed dates, and cash
flow. Often, a sponsor or customer wants the project
sooner than the original schedule suggests. In these
cases, many approaches may be considered to expedite
the schedule. These schedule adjustments will be con-
sidered in Chapters 8 and 9.

Bank Project Schedule
This is an actual schedule of a subproject from the bank.
The holding banking group in Europe is rolling out a
project management tool to all its regions (countries in
Europe and Africa). They have developed the tool over
the past few years, and this schedule reflects the
activities to take on regional users and projects. There is
no software implementation on employee computers as
such, as the single instance of the tool resides in Europe
and is accessed via the company network.
Exhibit 7.24 shows the overall subproject with all
details hidden. This overall view is useful when
discussing the project with senior managers who want
to understand the big picture and as a starting point in
discussing with other stakeholders who will want to
see details in one or more specific areas. Several
things can be noted from the partial schedule shown in
Exhibit 7.24. The task ribbon is displayed showing
available choices. The project timeline just under the
ribbon shows the summary for the entire project. A
person can read the dates just under the timeline.
Intermediate summaries are shown. The detail is
shown for start-up and initiation, but is hidden for
execution and closure. Project managers can show or
hide as much detail as their sponsors and other
stakeholders wish. Critical activities are shown in color.
Work breakdown structure numbering is shown in the
leftmost column. Note this company chose to display
the predecessor–successor relationships with arrows
and did not choose to show the amount of float for
each activity.

Clarence W. Schawk. The product being manufactured was printing plates.
More than fifty years and fifty acquisitions later, Schawk, with offices all over
the world, is recognized as a global leader in brand point management.

Topics:
• Estimate activity
resources
• Plan human resource
management
• Develop schedule
leadership and maximizing sales. Being first to market can confer long-lasting
benefits to the brands seen as “the original.” Ultimately, bringing products to
market that help brands win at the shelf—where the consumers votes with
their wallets—delivers measurable, long-lasting benefits to brand owners.
Many
of
the
world’s
most
respected
organizations
struggle
with
managing projects globally. While their products and marketing strategies
may be innovative, their go-to-market processes are often linear, time-
consuming, and very inefficient. Their progress toward achieving strategic
business goals through the launch of new brands and products is thwarted
by
many
factors,
including
“silo-ization”
and
heterogeneous
cultures,
languages, government regulations, and time zones.
Schawk has adapted by integrating our strategic, creative, and executional
capabilities, which are supported by BLUE, our primary brand management
technology product. BLUE enables global companies to unite their stakeholders
(internal and external), projects, and processes into a single, streamlined
workflow management system regardless of geographic boundaries. While
workflows are unique to each company, they often combine on-, near-, and off-
site project teams around the world.
Increasingly, companies outsource their non-core competencies such as
internal design and production departments to Schawk, because that is a core
competency of ours, and we can manage these functions more efficiently. This
allows the client’s project manager to manage a single Schawk point of contact,
allowing him or her to spend more time focusing on higher-value strategic
issues.
We identify and help remove process bottlenecks, offer online collaborative
project management tools, and provide knowledgable human talent to deliver
what we call brand point management. Brand point management helps
companies create compelling and consistent brand experiences across brand
touch points.

How do you decide who you need to work on your project? How do you know when you need
each worker? How do you secure the services of those people? How do you make sure each
worker has a steady amount of work to do, but not an overwhelming amount at any time?
How do you make sure your project schedule is realistic, considering who will do the work?
These and many other related questions are answered when you correctly resource a
project. Resources include people (human resources) along with machines, space, and
other things you need to get the project done. In this chapter, we will primarily discuss
human resources.
8-1 Abilities Needed when Resourcing Projects
Project managers need two types of abilities to correctly resource a project. The first type of
skill needed is technical. Various techniques can be used to estimate resource demands,
create a staffing management plan, assign one or more persons to each activity, identify
when a person is assigned too much work at a point in time, schedule a project with limited
numbers of key people and other resources, and compress (speed up) a project schedule.
The second type of skill needed is behavioral. As you might guess, many behavioral
issues are involved in completing project resourcing tasks such as:
•
Selecting the right people
•
Identifying exactly what each person needs to accomplish
•
Ensuring each person either has the capability needed or developing that person
to be capable
•
Dealing with difficult individual work schedules
•
Getting people to work overtime when there are conflicts
•
Making honest and open estimates of the amount of work required to complete an
activity
•
Assembling an effective team
•
Dealing with people from diverse backgrounds
•
Deciding where each person will work
•
Deciding how a team that is geographically split can work in an effective virtual manner
8-1a The Science and Art of Resourcing Projects
The science and art of project resourcing are to perform the technical and behavioral
aspects together in a manner that reinforces both. A resource-based schedule that is
technically brilliant, but has little acceptance from those who must do the work, has little
value. Likewise, an effective project team whose members have impractical resource
assignments is still likely to struggle. If one needs to choose between the two, a motivated
team with poor assignments is more likely to be successful. However, when both are
done well, the project has wonderful prospects.
This chapter covers both technical and behavioral aspects of determining and secur-
ing effective human resources for a project. While each specific skill and behavioral
consideration is introduced separately, keep in mind that people are inclined to support
what they have helped to plan. Therefore, when possible, identify your key people as
soon as possible and get them engaged in the planning.
8-1b Considerations when Resourcing Projects
As we cover the specific skills and behavioral aspects of resourcing projects, the following
ideas should be kept in mind:
•
If some of the key people on a project do not have the skills to participate, managers
should help them develop those skills.
210
Part 2 Planning Projects

•
Projects always have tradeoffs; with regard to resources, time versus human resources
versus other costs versus scope should be considered. Which of these takes precedence
on the project you are planning?
•
Project managers need to understand resource limitations to prevent over-promising.
Often, after activities are tentatively scheduled as discussed in the previous chapter, it
appears that the project can be completed by a particular date. However, the schedule
may be unrealistic if enough resources are not available at key points in time.
•
People are often a large portion of total project cost. This is especially true when a
project requires special knowledge.
8-1c Activity- versus Resource-Dominated Schedules
All project schedules are based in part on the individual activities (both the estimates of
how long each activity will take and their logical order, as discussed in Chapter 7) and in
part on the number of human resources who are available when needed (the topic of this
chapter). However, in some circumstances, the schedule is based more on the activities,
and in others it is based more on the resource limits. Exhibit 8.1 lists situations where
schedules are based more on activities or more on resources. Some organizations use
critical chain (explained in Section 8.8) or agile in situations where the schedule is
dominated more by resources.
Agile techniques are often used when the client does not really understand their needs
at the project start, it is expected that a rapid rate of change will exist on the project,
multiple short deliveries are possible, and the client and project team can collaborate to
reduce the impact of activities being dependent on each other.
8-2 Estimate Resource Needs
A starting point in resourcing a project is to estimate how many resources of each
type and skill or knowledge level are needed. The PMBOK task estimate activity
resources is “the process of estimating the types and quantities of material, human
resources, equipment, or supplies required to perform each activity.”1 This can be
accomplished at either a detailed or an overview level. When a project team deter-
mines a detailed list of activities that must be performed, it makes sense to ask what
type of person (by specific knowledge or skill) is needed to perform each of the activ-
ities. However, when a project team does not identify individual activities, they still

need to determine how many resources and what knowledge and skill each needs to
complete the project. If the team uses rolling wave planning, they probably develop
detailed resource requirements for the early part of the project for which they have
identified specific activities, and less detailed requirements for later project phases
for which the activity detail is not yet as specific.
When estimating resource needs, the team needs to make sure they have considered
support needs as well such as information systems and human resources. Some types of
workers have specific constraints placed upon how they are hired, scheduled, and
released. Co-located teams and highly skilled resources often require more detailed
resource planning. Many issues may be involved in securing specific knowledge or skills.
When estimating resource needs, it is wise to include time to communicate between
activities as well as time to perform activities. “Handoffs” occur when one person or
group passes work on to another group.
8-3 Plan Human Resource Management
Plan Human Resource Management is “the process of identifying and documenting
project roles, responsibilities, required skills, reporting relationships, and creating a staff-
ing management plan.”2 Roles and responsibilities for project participants can be docu-
mented in role descriptions. These often include title, assigned duties, and limits of
authority as shown in Exhibit 8.2.
A staffing management plan is “a component of the human resource plan that
describes when and how project team members will be acquired and how long they will
be needed.”3 The staffing management plan addresses how to identify potential internal
and/or external human resources for the project; determine the availability of each; and
decide how to handle timing issues with regard to building up, developing, rewarding,
and releasing the project team.
8-3a Identify Potential Resources
Identifying people who might work on a project differs significantly from one organiza-
tion to another. Many organizations are staffed in a lean manner and have few people
from which to choose. In a small organization, one particular person may often be the
logical choice for certain types of work on a project. However, in larger organizations
and in situations where outside resources may be hired, identifying potential people
becomes a bigger issue. Whatever the situation, a project manager needs to understand
who is potentially available to work on her project. A project manager keeps in mind the

estimated resources needed when identifying the people who could potentially work on
the project. This information can include factors such as:
•
Work functions (may include job titles and range of responsibilities)
•
Professional discipline (may include degrees and professional certifications)
•
Skill level (may include experience and performance ratings)
•
Physical location (may include willingness to relocate and travel)
•
Organizational/administrative unit (may include costs and contractual issues)4
Once this information is identified for the most likely pool of people, a project
manager can compare the available people to the estimated resource needs to identify
both gaps in specific skills that are needed and gaps in the number of people available
versus those needed. If it is clear that more and/or different people are needed, then
the project manager needs to look elsewhere. That could mean other departments or
divisions of the company, or it could mean looking outside the organization. A project
manager, perhaps with help from the sponsor, continues the identification of potential
resources until an adequate number and mix of potential people have been identified.
Key people should be identified as early as possible. The project core team is ideally iden-
tified and assigned soon enough to participate in chartering the project. Beyond the core
team, it is helpful to get key subject matter experts (SMEs) on board early if possible, not
only to help plan the project, but also to help develop the project culture and get it off to a
quick start. People are more likely to be enthusiastic about performing work they helped to
plan, and this motivation often comes in handy during difficult stretches in a project.
When possible, create options for people—try not to assign people who are unwilling
participants. Experienced project managers understand that the better they take care of
people who work with them on one project, the easier it is to recruit capable and enthu-
siastic people for their next project.
Make opportunities equally available to qualified candidates. First of all, project managers
need to do this both from a legal and an ethical perspective. Successful project managers also
find many advantages in having diverse teams. Different perspectives should be considered in
making decisions and may help avoid major risks that a single perspective would not have
uncovered. More creative approaches are undertaken. More stakeholders are effectively man-
aged since different project team members sometimes relate better to particular stakeholders.
8-3b Determine Resource Availability
Once the potential resources have been identified and compared to the estimated
resource needs, it is necessary to discover if the identified people are available and to
secure their commitment. This is necessary
even for internal projects because multiple
projects often choose resources from the same
resource pool. A schedule is preliminary until
needed resources are committed to the project.
In terms of resource availability, full- and
part-time resources as well as internal and exter-
nal resources may be available. If the new project
is of higher priority than an existing project,
resources that were already committed may be
freed up. Regarding ability to commit at a very
detailed level, some people have individual calen-
dars with specific vacation or other unavailable
times. Exhibit 8.3 shows how a consulting com-
pany determines resource availability.

8-3c Decide Timing Issues when Resourcing Projects
Projects, because of their temporary nature and unique outputs, have timing issues unlike
those of ongoing operations. Early in the project, one timing issue is when to bring people
on board. Bringing them on before they are needed can be costly. However, if the project
manager takes a chance with an important resource and that person is not available, the
schedule will probably be delayed. The general solution to the first timing issue is to assign
key players as quickly as possible. This helps establish good project planning, effective proj-
ect culture, and early project progress. Of course, a project manager may need to negotiate
not just for who will be assigned to his project, but when they will be assigned.
As members are brought on board, timing issues involve getting the team functioning
effectively and keeping them motivated and on schedule. Team development is covered
in Chapter 13.
Near the end of a project, timing issues include rewarding, recognizing, and releasing
project team members. How are they rewarded? Under what circumstances are they
released from the project, and what provision is made for them to be assigned to new
work and/or promoted? These issues are addressed in Chapter 15.
The staffing management plan deals with these three issues: how the project planners
identify potential people for the project, how they determine which people are available
and secure their services, and how to deal with timing issues of building up and then
releasing the project workforce.
EXHIBIT 8.3
MANAGING RESOURCE AVAILABILITY
Under pressure to complete the next phase of a new product being developed, a product development team urgently needed
talented manpower. The existing team consisted of mostly technical talent (engineers, designers, and technicians). A review was
performed by the product development team to find potential resources. Potential sources included:
•
Existing staff
•
Within their department
•
Within their company but outside their department
•
Staff misfit but talented
•
Staff burned out and in need of a fresh challenge
•
Temporary staff
•
External supplier and customer staff
To the team’s frustration, requests for additional staff were declined. To their surprise, upon further investigation,
multiple opportunities developed:
•
Product development staff working on separate projects had some idle time. Staff members thought to be dedicated to
only a specific project were available for part-time support due to gaps in their schedule.
•
Product development staff disinterested or “burned out” with their current project were eager for a different challenge.
•
Underemployed staff members (at large) were found to be eager to step up to the plate. Existing projects did not keep
them fully challenged.
•
Some of the work required for completion of the next project phase was highly technical, requiring advanced knowledge,
computer hardware, and very costly analysis software. To the team’s delight, dedicated supplier staff was available to help
with development. Advanced computer hardware and software, otherwise unreachable by the core team, were available if
potential sales would justify the time investment. A balance was struck where the manufacturer and supplier effectively met
each other’s needs for mutual benefit. The product development team could overcome their technical hurdles, while the
supplier could grow the business through new sales.

Part 2 Planning Projects

8-4 Project Team Composition Issues
Project teams are often composed of people from many sources—both within and out-
side a parent company. Several of these issues, such as who will be on the project and
where each will be physically located, are best considered when selecting team members.
These issues are introduced here, and the management of teams with these compositions
is discussed in Chapter 13.
8-4a Cross-Functional Teams
Projects often require cross-functional teams since the work of many projects requires input
from multiple disciplines. When people from different backgrounds work together, misun-
derstandings often arise. An engineer may be predisposed to look at an issue one way, while
an accountant may look at the same issue a different way. This may be due to education,
experience, and/or personality. A project manager may feel sometimes that she is a translator
between various functions that are working on the project. It is useful for project managers to
develop an ability to understand and speak effectively with various technical experts. The
project manager is not the expert, but she must understand the experts, be able to communi-
cate with them, and have the experts trust her judgment.
8-4b Co-Located Teams
Another team issue is where everyone physically sits. Teams are co-located if the members
are assigned work spaces near each other. Project managers and teams can often take
advantage of many modern methods for communicating from anywhere on the planet.
These methods are used often, especially for larger decisions. However, many minor deci-
sions are made every day on projects. Many times, a person might not feel that something
is important enough to create a document or make a phone call. That same person might
ask the person sitting in the next desk or a person he runs into in the hall. Sometimes a
person does not want to interrupt her thought process, but would casually ask a person
right next to herself a question. Co-location helps to create these opportunities for easy
communications. On some projects, members of a supplier company and/or representa-
tives from the customer may have a desk in the project work space.
8-4c Virtual Teams
Virtual teams are also common and represent the opposite approach. Members of virtual
teams do not meet face to face very often. Sometimes a project requires the expertise of
many far-flung people, and it is impractical to have them all work in the same area.
These teams require many forms of communications. Many people report that if they
have met another person face to face even once, they feel they can relate better to that
person. Therefore, even for far-flung teams, it is common to bring people together once
for a chartering or project kickoff session. Of course, some project managers travel
frequently to allow for regularly scheduled face-to-face contact with important team
members, customers, and suppliers.
8-4d Outsourcing
Many project managers are faced with the prospect of not finding the necessary talent
within their organization. When that is the case, project managers often need to hire
expertise from one or more other organizations. This is discussed in Chapter 12. The
author remembers one project where he worked for a European consulting firm that
was hired to establish project management discipline at the IT headquarters of a large
accounting firm. The accounting firm had fired its own internal consultants and replaced
them with those of the European company, yet it decided to keep one of its own
Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects
215

consultants from each of its Boston and New York offices on the team for political rea-
sons. This was an awkward arrangement, but this type of situation occurs fairly often.
Outsourcing can allow a project to bring in talent from anywhere in the world, but it
can also lead to some tense situations.
8-5 Assign a Resource to Each Activity
Once you have identified the workers you want, sometimes you will be able to easily get
them. This is especially true if your project is a high priority for your organization and if
you have already developed a reputation as a project manager with whom many people
want to work. However, a project manager is unlikely to secure all the necessary highly
qualified resources he needs. He can expect to negotiate for the desired people.
Hopefully, the core team was assigned during the initiating stage and participated in
chartering the project. Now is the time to ensure that the core team is complete and
without undue overlaps. It is also the time to assign workers to each activity. On small
projects, most of these assignments may be to core team members. On larger projects,
many other individuals may be involved as subject matter experts. It is also helpful to
specify exactly what each person is responsible for and what authority that person has.
8-5a Show Resource Responsibilities on RACI Chart
A responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) is “a grid that shows the project resources
assigned to each work package.”5 A RACI is “a common type of responsibility assign-
ment matrix that uses responsible, accountable, consult, and inform to define involve-
ment of stakeholders in project activities.”6 The first column on the RACI is usually the
WBS coding of work packages and activities. The second column includes the names of
the work packages and project activities that correspond to the WBS. The remaining
columns each represent a person who is involved with the project. A partial RACI chart
example is shown in Exhibit 8.4.
In Exhibit 8.4, many activities have more than one person who has some involvement.
For example, for the activity “conduct student surveys” Dan is responsible to complete
the work, but the project manager, is the one person who is accountable for the results.
Dan needs to consult with team member Ben and the students and needs to inform
everyone else. In a RACI chart, only one person should have primary accountability for
any activity. If more than one person has accountability, it is too easy for them to blame
each other if something goes wrong.
RACI charts are extremely useful for assigning activities to project core team mem-
bers, subject matter experts, and the project manager. They are also useful in managing
project communications. They go further than the original communications plan in
that they identify every project activity and specify the exact involvement of each
stakeholder.
8-5b Show Resource Assignments on Gantt Chart
Once it has been decided who will perform each activity, it is an easy matter to show the
assignments on a project schedule. For example, the responsible person for each activity
for a portion of the Alternative Breaks project is listed right next to the activity in the
Gantt chart schedule in Exhibit 8.5. Showing the responsibilities directly on the schedule
is a simple, visual way to communicate responsibilities. For simplicity’s sake, each person
has been assigned to work on most activities 75 percent of their time. In some projects,
some people will spend 75 percent of their time for the duration of a specific activity,
while other activities may require only a small fraction of their time across the activity’s
duration. Generally people are available for work on a project less than 100 percent of
216
Part 2 Planning Projects

their time for many reasons (such as those described in Exhibit 7.9). Nevertheless, this
demonstrates how to keep track of all of the time a person spends working on a project.
Directions for how to construct each of the exhibits regarding resources in MS Project
are given in Section 8.9.

8-5c Summarize Resource Responsibilities by
Time Period with Histogram
Once it is clear who is responsible for each activity, it is time to understand how the
multiple demands add up on each worker. Are any of the workers overloaded? To
answer this question, the demands for each worker at each time period should be added.
Exhibit 8.6 shows the responsibilities for Patrick for the various activities.
When looking at overloaded workers, it is easiest to consider each worker individu-
ally. For this example, the person in question is the project leader. Remember, we
assigned the project leader to work on each activity 75 percent of his time so that we
could see how the total demands add up. Exhibit 8.6, shows Patrick is grossly overloaded
at several points. In fact, through much of the schedule, Patrick is scheduled to work 150
percent of his available time!

Part 2 Planning Projects

8-6 Dealing with Resource Overloads
Once it is obvious that a particular person has been overloaded at a given point in time,
it is helpful to pinpoint exactly which activities are involved. One easy way to do that is
to compare the resource histogram, such as the one in Exhibit 8.6, to the Gantt chart
schedule, shown in Exhibit 8.5. It is helpful to view both charts together using the same
time scale, as shown in Exhibit 8.7. Remember Patrick is available 75 percent of the time
(30 hours per week), so you can see where and by how much he is overloaded.
Clearly, Patrick is scheduled to perform several activities at the same time and is
overloaded much of the time. Project scheduling software helps to deal with resource
overloads by pinpointing when the overloads occur for each worker and by identifying
which activities that worker is assigned to perform. How should this be resolved? Soft-
ware greatly assists in identifying and understanding the problem, but it takes manage-
ment decisions to solve the problem.
8-6a Methods of Resolving Resource Overloads
Once a project manager understands who is overloaded and what activities are involved,
she can employ many possible methods to rework the project schedule so the worker is
not too overloaded. Some of these methods are as follows:
•
Assign certain activities to other workers. In our example, perhaps “identify goals of
program” could be handled by the directors, and perhaps “document the trip plans”
could be handled by Tori. This new schedule is shown in Exhibit 8.8. Note Patrick is
still overallocated, but only for three weeks much later in the project. While this is
an improvement, perhaps other means should also be used.
•
Sometimes an activity can be split into two activities, with the first part being per-
formed as scheduled and the last part delayed. This is probably not a good strategy
in our example project because it would probably only delay the overload rather
than resolve it. This is often not an attractive strategy since many activities when
split take more total time. It often takes people a little time to remember where they
left off when they resume work.
EXHIBIT 8.7

Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects
219

•
Another method of resolving the overloads is to reorder the activities. This may include
questioning the logic that was used when creating the schedule. One means of
reordering activities, fast tracking, is covered in Section 8.7 on compressing schedules.
•
Sometimes when people understand how badly overloaded a resource is, they decide
they need to acquire or borrow additional resources.
•
If a resource is impossibly overloaded, perhaps the project scope needs to be reduced
or the schedule needs to be extended.
•
If there is a severe overload and one of these strategies needs to be employed, it
usually makes sense to inform the sponsor. The project manager needs to under-
stand who is overloaded, when the overload occurs, and what activities cause the
overload. Good project managers will then be able to determine possible courses of
action. However, it may be up to the sponsor to make the final decision on how to
resolve the overload.
•
It is often helpful to resource-level the overloaded person’s schedule as described
below.
Resource leveling is “a technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based
upon resource constraints with the goal of balancing demand for resources with the
available supply.”7 The most common form of resource leveling is when activities are
delayed so the person does not need to perform as many activities at the same time.
Normally, noncritical activities are delayed by an amount no more than their slack in
the hope that the overloads can be resolved without extending the project schedule.
However, if none of the alternatives discussed above is feasible and delaying the noncrit-
ical activities within their slack is not sufficient, the project schedule will slip. Essentially,
this delay reduces peak demand and smoothes the period-to-period resource usage. An
example follows, starting with Exhibit 8.9.
EXHIBIT 8.8
SCHEDULE WITH REASSIGNMENTS EXAMPLE

Part 2 Planning Projects

In this example, Jane has been assigned all of the activities. They will require 40 percent,
55 percent, or 75 percent of her time as marked. During the middle part of the schedule, Jane
has too many activities to perform at the same time. Therefore, any activities scheduled at
that time that are not critical should be considered for delay. The easiest way to understand
the work demands and be able to adjust the schedule within the limits of their available work
time starts with creating a critical path schedule, as shown in the top portion of Exhibit 8.9. It
is helpful to clearly mark the critical path and to “front load” the schedule—that is, to show
every activity starting as soon as the activities that precede it are complete. Then, a resource
histogram can be built for each person who may be overloaded. Start by putting the critical
path activities on the bottom, because those activities need to be completed as scheduled or
the entire project will be late. In our example, those are activities 1, 3, 6, and 7. Next, add all
of the noncritical path activities above at the earliest time they can be scheduled. In our
example these are 2, 4, and 5. With the 75 percent line showing Jane’s maximum available
time, it is easy to see that she cannot complete everything as scheduled.
The first conflict is activities 2 and 3. Since activity 3 is on the critical path, activity 2
should be compromised. If Jane waited until there was no conflict to schedule activity 2, how-
ever, the project would be delayed. Notice that activity 2 is currently scheduled for 40 percent
of Jane’s time for three working days, for a total of 1.2 days of work. If Jane can work on
activity 2 for 20 percent of her time during the six days she is working the other 55 percent
on activity 3, she would complete both after six work days. Activities 4 and 5 would both then
be delayed until activity 2 is complete. This partially leveled schedule is shown in Exhibit 8.10.
Notice that Jane has time to finish activity 4 without delaying activity 7 (and, therefore, the
critical path). Part of activity 5 could be worked after activity 4 and before activity 7 without
overloading Jane, but a portion of activity 5 would still force an overload situation.
If the noncritical activities must be completed at the rate of effort shown in the original
schedule, some of them may need to be assigned to another worker. Resource leveling can
be as much art as science. The combination of the critical path schedule and resource histo-
gram allows a project manager to understand who is overloaded, at what time, and by what
specific activities. Then, the project manager seeks to move some of the noncritical activities
within their slack to level the demand for that worker. If enough leveling can be done, the

Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects
221

project can proceed as scheduled. If not, some activities must be accomplished by other
means, the schedule will slip, or perhaps the scope will need to be reduced.
8-7 Compress the Project Schedule
Now that the project manager knows how long the project schedule is expected to take,
he can compare it with what the sponsor or customer wants. If the expected time is too
long, he will need to reduce the critical path (remember that because the critical path is
the longest, it dictates the total project duration).
8-7a Actions to Reduce the Critical Path
A variety of actions can be taken to reduce the critical path as follows:
•
Reduce the project scope and/or quality.
•
Overlap sequential activities using finish-to-finish (FF), start-to-start (SS), or start-
to-finish (SF) relationships.
•
Partially overlap sequential activities by using time leads.
•
Increase the number of work hours per day or work days per week.
•
Schedule activities that are normally in sequence at the same time.
•
Shorten activities by assigning more resources.
•
Shorten activities that cost the least to speed up.
The first item, reducing scope and/or quality, normally requires permission from the
sponsor and/or customer. Scope reductions are fairly common. Sometimes, the original
scope includes features that are nice to have but are not essential, which people are will-
ing to give up when they understand the schedule impact. Quality reductions are far less
common and are discussed in Chapter 11.
The next two items, time leads and alternative dependencies, are discussed in Chapter 7.
The last four items, on the other hand, apply to two other techniques used to compress
schedules, namely crashing and fast tracking. Crashing is “a technique used to shorten
the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.”8 Fast tracking
is “a schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in
sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration.”9
EXHIBIT 8.10

222
Part 2 Planning Projects

One simple way to understand the differences between crashing and fast tracking is to
determine what is given up in return for the faster schedule. Crashing almost always
costs more money to speed up the schedule. Fast tracking almost always increases the
risk to speed up the schedule. Both make management more difficult since either more
activities take place at the same time and/or more activities have workers on overtime.
Let us turn to the specifics of each.
8-7b Crashing
When crashing a project schedule, certain activities are performed at a faster-
than-normal pace. This often requires overtime pay, but could also require extra charges
for expedited deliveries, more expensive machinery, or other methods. When deciding
which activities to speed up, two questions must be asked. First, which activities are on
the critical path? Since the critical path determines how long the project takes, speeding
up any activity not on the critical path makes no difference. Second, which critical path
activity costs the least on a per-day basis to speed up? There is no sense in paying more
than necessary. We will use the project in Exhibit 8.11 to illustrate crashing.
Note that the enumeration method was used to identify each path and its duration.
Path ABEG at 25 days is the critical path. This example is in days, but it works equally

well with weeks or any other unit of time. Also note that three small tables of informa-
tion are included in Exhibit 8.11 to help us keep track of times and costs as we make the
crashing decisions. The first table is the list of the paths with the time each is expected to
take. Remember, we only want to crash activities on the critical path. Every time we
reduce the length of an activity, we record the impact on the affected path(s).
The second information table lists each activity along with the normal time and cost (the
expected time and cost if this activity is not crashed), the crash cost and time (the fastest the
activity could be accomplished and the total cost incurred if it is crashed), and the crash cost
per unit of time (in this example, per day). The activities that are on the critical path are
identified by a triangle symbol. Two activities, A and C, have the same crash time as normal
time. This means they cannot be crashed and are crossed out. We need the information in
this table to identify which critical path activities cost the least to speed up.
We use the third small table to keep track of how long the project is, which activity(ies)
we choose to speed up, and how much it costs. Using the normal time for all activities, the
project is expected to take 25 days. We crash activities one day at a time. Note that path
ADFG requires 24 days—only one day less than the critical path.
Activities A, B, E, and G are on the critical path. Activity A cannot be crashed. Some
activities are impractical to speed up, even for extra cost. Activity B at $50 is the least
expensive of the choices, so that is the one to crash first. Note that activity F only costs
$25 to speed up, but it is not on the critical path so it is not chosen. Once we speed up B
by one day, the resulting information is placed into the tables, as shown in Exhibit 8.12.

Part 2 Planning Projects

In the first table, path ABEG has been reduced to 24 days since B is now being crashed.
In the second table, activity B is now shown as seven days since it has been crashed one day.
In the third table, the duration is now 24 days, B is crashed, the incremental cost is $50, and
so is the cumulative cost because that is the only activity crashed so far. Now there are two
critical paths of 24 days each. The activities on the second critical path, ADFG, are identified
by a circular symbol. To further crash the project, both paths need to be shortened. This
could be accomplished by crashing one activity on each critical path, such as B or E on the
first path and D or F on the second path. It could also be accomplished by crashing one
activity that is on both paths, such as activity G. The least expensive of these alternatives is B
and F for a total cost of $75. The results of this are shown in Exhibit 8.13.
After two rounds, both critical paths are 23 days. Note that path ACFG is also
reduced, as F is on it and F was crashed. Since F cannot be crashed any further, a line
is drawn through it. The cumulative cost of crashing the project two days is $125.
Exhibit 8.14 shows the choices of continuing to crash activities until it is no longer
worthwhile. That is called an “all-crash” schedule. Note that even in that circumstance
activity D is not reduced the full amount possible since reducing it further would not
make a difference in the length of the overall project.

Many questions can be answered with this information, such as the following:
•
How fast can the project be completed?
•
To crash the project one day, what activity would be crashed, and what would it
cost?
•
To crash the project two days, what activities would be crashed, and what would it
cost in total?
•
If there is a bonus of $125 per day for finishing early, what activities would be
crashed, and how fast would the project be completed?
•
If there is a bonus of $225 per day for finishing early, what activities would be
crashed, and how fast would the project be completed?
8-7c Fast Tracking
Fast tracking occurs when activities that are normally performed in series (one after the
other) are performed at the same time. In Exhibit 8.15, fast tracking could potentially be
accomplished at several points. For example, while A is being done, B could also be per-
formed. This certainly can speed things up as more things can be done at the same time.
There is a risk, however. For example, if activity A is to design a part and activity B is to
order material for the part, the normal routine would be to wait until the part is

designed to be sure to order the correct materials. By performing both at the same time,
there is a risk that the design will call for different materials than expected and the
materials will need to be reordered. One strategy to gain benefits of fast tracking while
attempting to control risk is to use a combination of alternate dependencies with
time leads and lags to only partially overlap activities, as described in Chapter 7. Partial
activity overlaps entail less risk than full overlaps. Another strategy is to only overlap a
few activities so you can manage them closely. One would ordinarily look for long-
duration activities on the critical path for this overlapping.
8-8 Alternative Scheduling Methods
Several alternative approaches are used in certain industries or certain situations to cre-
ate project schedules, including critical chain, reverse phase, agile, auto/manual, and roll-
ing wave scheduling. These approaches are not mutually exclusive—a person can use
some of the logic from more than one of these methods on the same project.
8-8a Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)
There are several problems with scheduling projects in many organizations that tradi-
tional critical path scheduling, even with resource leveling, does not always address satis-
factorily. Some of these problems are as follows:
•
Many people make conservative duration estimates. Often, people are punished for
completing work late, so they give themselves plenty of time in their estimates.
•
Durations of some activities vary greatly. The part of this variation that is due to
specific possible events taking place can be managed by risk management techniques
as discussed in Chapter 10. The other part of the variation, known as common cause
or random variation, sometimes is just difficult to accurately estimate.
•
Many project workers tend to use all of the time available to them. Instead of fin-
ishing early and getting the work to the next person, they keep fine-tuning their
work and turn it in on time.

•
To keep multiple projects moving, many workers are asked to multitask. Up to a
point, multitasking is helpful in keeping multiple projects moving and keeping the
workers stimulated. However, many people are asked to multitask far beyond that
point; by not focusing on a limited number of things, they sometimes cannot give
adequate attention to any.
One approach to address problems such as these is called critical chain project man-
agement (CCPM). CCPM is also sometimes known as the critical chain method. The
critical chain method is “a schedule method that allows the project team to place buffers
on any project schedule path to account for limited resources and project uncertainties.”10
Simply put, rather than calculate the critical path based upon predecessor–successor
relationships alone, it also incorporates calculations on resource availability. Once the
resource that is most in demand is identified, efforts are made to keep that resource
appropriately busy on critical chain activities (those critical both because of the
predecessor–successor relationships and because of resource shortages) but not over-
loaded. Other components of the CCPM system include the following:
•
Avoiding multitasking
•
Estimating aggressively how quickly each activity can be completed
•
Putting a feeding buffer of time directly in front of critical chain activities to ensure
they will not be delayed
•
Putting the time normally reserved for the uncertainty in each individual activity at
the end of the project as a total project buffer that the project manager can use as
needed
•
Finishing activities early if possible and passing the work on to the next worker
Proponents of critical chain say it is a major innovation that helps to overcome some
of project management’s most difficult scheduling and resourcing problems. Detractors
say it is another approach that may work in certain circumstances. It requires a great
deal of reeducation and communication on everyone’s part to make it successful, and
when resources are reallocated from the buffer to a task in trouble, more work may be
created.
8-8b Reverse Phase Schedules
Another alternative scheduling method that is sometimes used in the construction indus-
try is called a reverse phase schedule or Last Planner System. The reverse phase schedule
is developed by the people closest to the work (often either the hands-on workers or the
forepersons who directly supervise work) by starting with the final project deliverables
and continually asking what needs to be completed prior to starting work on this deliv-
erable. As each activity is defined, its order is established, and the person proposing it
verifies that their company has the worker(s) to complete the activity as shown in the
tentative schedule.
Using this method, the team systematically thinks from the end of the project toward
the beginning. This is also a good practice to help ensure that both all of the project
deliverables and the list of activities are complete because by working backward missing
deliverables and activities tend to be easier to identify.
8-8c Rolling Wave Planning
The idea behind rolling wave planning is to plan the first part of the project in as much
detail as needed and to plan later portions only at a high level. This allows the project
team to focus on the near term without ignoring the longer term. It means the project
team needs to plan progressively more detail as information becomes available. Rolling
228
Part 2 Planning Projects

wave planning is illustrated near the end of Chapter 9 by showing a dummy activity for
a late project phase. The extreme of rolling wave planning is agile.
8-8d Agile Project Planning
The fundamental ideas behind agile project planning are to use a collaborative approach
with workers and other stakeholders heavily involved in planning; to recognize that
while it may be difficult to scope the entire project at the outset, stakeholders do want
to have a ballpark idea of total cost, schedule, and functionality before approving a proj-
ect; and to understand that while uncontrolled change is bad, too strenuous change con-
trol often means valid emergent stakeholder wishes are not met. These ideas permeate
the contemporary project management approach of this book. They have been intro-
duced in several earlier chapters and identified with margin icons and are explained in
more detail in the Project Management in Action example at the conclusion of this
chapter.
8-8e Auto/Manual Scheduling
Microsoft Project now includes a feature called manual scheduling to enable users to
more closely emulate MS Excel. This may be comforting for users who are more familiar
with Excel than Project. When people are chartering a project and want to show the few
milestones without committing to dates, manual scheduling may be a good starting
point. Also, for projects with few predecessor–successor relationships, manual scheduling
may sometimes be useful. However, for the majority of projects, the ability of MS Project
to plan and track activities based upon logical relationships is useful and suggests manual
scheduling is not enough.
8-9 Using MS Project for Resource Allocation
Up to this point, a project manager has created a file with a project in MS Project, cre-
ated the WBS for the project, defined the predecessor–successor relationships among the
tasks, entered the expected duration for each task, and shown the critical path in red.
This covers the first two ways in which a project schedule may be constrained—namely
the logical order of tasks and the expected duration of each. Now we consider the third
way in which a schedule may be constrained—the number of key resources available
when needed. For the final constraints on schedules, cash flow will be covered in
Chapter 9 and imposed dates will be covered in Chapter 11. Using MS Project to under-
stand resource limitations includes four steps:
1. Define resources.
2. Assign resources.
3. Identify overallocated resources.
4. Deal with overallocations.
We can perform the first three steps very well with MS Project alone, but need to
consider managerial options as well as options MS Project can identify to deal with the
overallocations.
8-9a Step 1: Defining Resources
For a resource to be available to a project, it must be described in Microsoft Project’s
database. A resource may be a single unit, such as a person, or a resource may be a
pool of like units, such as five welding machines. Resources may include people, build-
ings, materials, facilities, or supplies—anything necessary for the completion of a task.
A G I L E
Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects
229

If possible, resource information should be entered in advance of the time of assign-
ment to a task. If entered at the time of assignment, only minimal information is sup-
plied, and the resource detail information must be completed later.
While many fields can be used for defining resources, at a minimum, the Resource
Name and Max Units fields need definition. If costs are to be modeled, then the Std.
Rate, Ovt. Rate, Cost/Use, and Accrue At values must also be defined. See Exhibit 8.16.
Steps in defining resources include:
1. On the View tab, Resource Views group, click Resource Sheet.
2. In the first blank row, enter the resource name in the Resource Name cell.
3. In the Initials cell, enter the initials of the resource.
4. Click the Max Units cell and enter the resource’s maximum availability.
Max Units defines the availability of a resource for project work. The default is
100 percent, but individual resources are not 100 percent available even if they are
working full time on a project. Availability will be something less than eight hours
if that is the normal working day. The unavailability includes general tasks required
of employees. It can also include ongoing process work such as a part-time help
desk role. For example, a person assigned primarily to one project may be available
about six hours per day (or 75 percent) for that project. If so, 75 percent would
be the Max Units for that resource. Note in Exhibit 8.16 that Chris is available up
to 75 percent of his time for the project, while Uma is only available 50 percent of
her time.
Things to consider when determining each resource’s Max Units value are as follows:
•
Determine what is considered project work.
•
Determine what is not considered project work (100 percent Max Units).
•
Organizational holidays are accounted for in the Standard (MS Project) calendar.
•
Vacation days are accounted for in each resource calendar.
CALENDARS If a different project calendar is needed because one or more resources
are working different days or shifts, or are subject to a different holiday schedule, the
Base Calendar field is used to specify that different project calendar.
Resource calendars are used to block out vacation days and other resource-specific
nonworking days. Resource calendars inherit project-wide working day definitions from
the standard (MS Project) calendar at the time the resource is first defined. Resource
calendars are used by MS Project to determine when a resource assignment can be
scheduled. If a task has no resource assignment, then the project calendar is used to
determine task scheduling.

8-9b Setting Up a Resource Calendar
1. Double click a resource row to activate the Task Information dialog for the resource
whose calendar needs revision.
2. On the General tab, click Change Working time… (see Exhibit 8.17).
3. Confirm the correct resource is chosen. The resource name is near the top of the
dialog.
4. Make revisions in the manner described in Chapter 6.
8-9c Step 2: Assigning Resources
During resource assignment, a project manager allocates one or more resources to an
activity. Microsoft Project then generates assignment information based on activity infor-
mation, resource information, switch settings, and possible data overrides. Assigning a
resource to an activity with no existing resource assignments (using default settings)
includes the following steps and is illustrated in Exhibit 8.18.
1. On the Task tab, View group, click Gantt Chart.
2. Right click in the Start column header, click Insert Column and enter Work to add
the Work column.

3. On the view tab, in the Split View group, click on Details.
4. Right click the form in the lower pane and select Resources and Predecessors (if not
already present).
5. In the upper pane, click the activity row needing a resource assignment.
6. Click the next blank row in the Resource Name column in the lower pane’s form.
7. Enter the resource name from the drop-down list.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to add additional resources to the assignment list.
9. Enter a units value if the Max Units value is not correct for any assignment.
10. Click the OK button. No assignment is made until the OK button is clicked.
11. Note that Work is calculated and the activity duration value did not change. Verify
that the assignment work and task work values reconcile with the estimated dura-
tion value.
The following data are necessary for creating assignments:
•
Duration is the number of time units between the activity start and end. The default
display value is in days. Each day spans eight work hours, plus one nonworking
hour after four hours have passed.
•
Units represent the availability of a resource for work each day. This value is the
same as the resource Max Units value unless it is overridden.
•
Work (assignment) is calculated by multiplying the Duration value (converted to
hours) by the Units value.
•
Task type is a switch that determines which of three values (duration, units, and
work) changes when one of the other two is modified. The switch settings are Fixed
Units (default), Fixed Duration, and Fixed Work.

Part 2 Planning Projects

BASIC ASSIGNMENT CALCULATION WITH FIXED UNITS SELECTED (DEFAULT
SETTINGS) When an assignment is made, MS Project uses the Duration and Units values
to calculate the number of hours a resource will work on the activity. The activity Duration
and Work fields may be adjusted. The Work field value in an activity row (Task Usage view)
is the sum of all of the assignment Work field values. The Work field value in a resource row
(Resource Usage view) is the sum of all of the resource assignment work values.
•
Activity with no prior resource assignments—MS Project uses the Duration and
Units values to calculate the assignment work value and sums the assignment Work
values into the activity Work field. The assignment of a 100 percent available
resource (Units = 100%) to a two-day-duration activity (eight-hour days) results in
sixteen hours of resource work across the two-day duration. An assignment of two
75 percent available resources (Units = 75%) results in twenty-four hours of work
assigned across the two-day duration.
•
Activity with one or more resources already assigned—when yet another
resource(s) is added, MS Project holds the activity Duration value constant and
adjusts the activity Work value. The addition of a 100 percent available resource
(Units = 100%) to a two-day duration activity that has a 100 percent available
resource already assigned results in thirty-two hours of activity work across the two-
day duration activity, with each resource assigned sixteen hours of assignment work.
•
Removal of resources works in reverse of the above. Removal of the resource from
an activity with one resource assigned results in zero task work. Removal of one
resource from an activity with two resources assigned results in the activity duration
held constant, work calculated for the remaining resource assignment, and the
activity work value the same as the assignment value.
MODIFYING AN ASSIGNMENT After an assignment is made, MS Project maintains a
relationship among the Duration, Units, and Work values. With the Fixed Units as the
Task Type:
1. Change the Duration, and MS Project changes the assignment work and task work values.
2. Change the Task Work, and MS Project changes the duration and assignment work
value(s).
3. Change an assignment units value, and MS Project holds the assignment work value
constant and changes the task duration.
Tips include the following:
•
If you don’t like MS Project adjusting the Duration value as you add and remove
resources assignments, an alternative is to switch the Task Type setting to Fixed
Work. On the File tab, Options, Schedule page, enter Fixed Duration. Also on the
same page, on the Scheduling Options for this Project field, enter All New Projects.
•
When trying different resource assignments on an activity, it is easy to lose the
original duration value, so save your original estimated duration value in a user-
defined Duration or Work field. On the Task tab, click Gantt Chart, right click the
Duration column heading, click Insert column and enter Duration 1. Then right
click the Duration 1 heading, click Field Settings, and enter Estimated Duration in
the Title box to name the column.
8-9d Step 3: Finding Overallocated Resources
A resource overallocation usually occurs when a resource is assigned to two or more
activities whose start and finish dates overlap, if only for a very small duration. An
Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects
233

overallocation can also occur if an assignment Units value is greater than the resource’s
Max Units value.
MS Project has a good set of tools to help find and understand each overallocation.
Once understood, you can make a management decision about an appropriate solu-
tion. Most solutions cannot be automatically implemented. There is an MS Project
feature (Level Resources) that resolves most overallocations by delaying the start of
all but one of the conflicting activity assignments. This may produce an unacceptably
lengthened schedule, so consider this as just one of many solution options. The Gantt
Chart Indicators field will display a red stick figure symbol if an assigned resource is
overallocated.
RESOURCE ALLOCATION VIEW With slight modification, the Resource Allocation
view is very helpful. The Show in menu checkbox makes this view available in the
View menu. The Detail Gantt marks the critical path (bold red) and graphically displays
free slack following each activity, which shows how much the activity can be delayed
before creating a new, longer critical path.
1. On the Task tab, View group, Gantt Chart drop-down menu, click More Views…
2. On the More Views dialog, scroll the Views display, enter Resource Allocation, and
click Edit.
3. On the View Definition dialog, click the Details Pane drop-down menu and enter
Detail Gantt.
4. On the View Definition dialog, click Show in menu.
5. Click OK, then click Apply.
6. In the upper pane, right click the Work column header and enter Insert Column.
7. Enter Max Units, then click Enter.
8. Add the activity Work column in the lower pane’s table to the left of the Leveling
Delay column (as above).
9. Hide the assignment rows in the upper pane’s table: right click in the Resource Name
field header to select all rows. On the View tab, Data group, Outline, enter Hide
Subtasks.
The results of these steps can be seen in Exhibit 8.19.
EXHIBIT 8.19
VIEW DEFINITION DIALOG BOX

Part 2 Planning Projects

The Resource Allocation view is a combination view with the Resource Usage view in
the upper pane and the Detail Gantt view in the lower pane. The time scale in the upper
pane is synchronized with the Gantt graphic in the lower pane. Adjusting the zoom
affects both panes.
The Gantt bars in the lower pane represent the duration of the work hours displayed
in the upper pane. Selecting a resource in the upper pane’s table displays the assignments
of that resource in the lower pane. Selecting a resource assignment in the upper pane
displays information about that assignment in the lower pane.
Resource data displayed in red in the upper pane’s table mark that resource as over-
allocated. In addition, if a yellow diamond with an exclamation mark is displayed in that
resource’s Indicator field, the overallocation is probably more serious.
Project uses the resource Max Units value and a basis value (the default is day-by-day). If
a resource is momentarily overloaded, the resource is marked overallocated. If the resource
has enough time in one day to complete all assignments, the yellow diamond does not dis-
play. If not enough time is available, then the yellow diamond is displayed.
In a task view, a red stick figure is displayed. In Exhibit 8.20, both Chris and Patrick
are marked as overallocated. The total assignment hours are displayed in the upper pane.
The Gantt bars in the lower pane represent each assignment.
A straightforward method of finding overallocated resources is as follows:
1. Set the timescale to the start of the schedule.
2. Slowly scroll the timescale toward the end of the schedule.
3. Analyze each instance of cell values displayed in red for cause and severity.
8-9e Step 4: Dealing with Overallocations
Once overallocations have been identified, there are many possible things a project man-
ager can do. The point to remember at this time is that MS Project is a tool only. It is
very helpful in identifying overallocations, but the project manager is responsible for
deciding what to do once the overallocation is found. Below are a few choices.
•
Keep MS Project’s resource leveling function set to Manual (Resource Leveling dia-
log box).
•
Protect the schedule’s critical path.
•
Replace an overallocated resource with one that has time for the assignment.
•
Reduce the Units assignment, extending the activity duration.
EXHIBIT 8.20
RESOURCE USAGE AND DETAILED GANTT VIEWS

Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects
235

•
De-scope the activity(ies).
•
If some assigned resources are performing little work, remove them.
•
Use the Leveling Delay task field to delay the start of one of the conflicting activities;
the duration value is in the elapsed duration form, in which all calendar days are
included, not just working days. Continue adding delay until the delay creates a new
critical path.
•
Check the Network Diagram for accuracy—correcting errors may remove the
conflict.
•
Ignore the overload if the resource impact is temporary.
Tips include the following:
•
Note the project finish date, work, and cost values.
•
Be aware of resource vacation days and organizational holidays.
•
If changing assignments, note the duration and work values for the task.
•
If swapping resources and there is a mix of units values among assigned resources, it
may be easier to remove all resource assignments and then reassign them.
•
Try Level Now (Resource Leveling dialog box, Tools menu); if the plan is suitable,
then go forward (delay is imposed).
•
Work from beginning to end. One fix may break something else.
Summary
Resourcing projects goes hand in hand with scheduling
(Chapter 7) and budgeting (Chapter 9). To ensure that
adequate human and other resources are assigned to a
project, first the project manager needs to look at the
listed activities and estimate the resources needed to
perform each. Potential resources need to be identified,
and their availability needs to be confirmed. The proj-
ect manager may need to negotiate to secure the ser-
vices of the needed people. Usually, some people
assigned to the project are ready to go, while others
need training and/or mentoring. Project teams some-
times need to rely on co-located and/or outsourced
team members.
Several tools are useful in identifying and schedul-
ing people. A human resource management plan with
role descriptions and staffing management plan as
components helps the team plan. Resource assign-
ments are often posted directly on a Gantt chart
schedule. RACI charts are matrices that depict work
activities on the vertical scale (often in the form of a
WBS) and the various people who are involved on the
horizontal scale. Work responsibilities are shown by
code in the cells. Once workers have been assigned,
responsibility histograms can be developed for each
worker to determine whether he or she is overloaded
at any point.
The combination of the critical path schedule with
resource assignments and the resource histogram
allows project planners to determine who is over-
loaded, at what time, and by what activities. Resource
leveling is the method of using this information to
reduce the peak demands for workers by postponing
some of the noncritical activities within the amount
of available slack. Sometimes this solves the problem.
If not, some work might be assigned to a different per-
son, the schedule might be delayed, the project scope
might be reduced, and/or other methods might be
employed. Often, the sponsor will want to be involved
in making these decisions.
Once the project schedule is established and resources
are assigned, it sometimes appears that the hoped-for
completion date is not attainable. In these cases, it is com-
mon to look for methods of accelerating (or compressing)
the project schedule. One frequently used method is crash-
ing, in which a decision is made to pay extra money (often
in the form of overtime pay) to speed up certain activities
on the critical path. Another frequently used method is
fast tracking, whereby activities that are normally con-
ducted in sequence are either overlapped or performed
in parallel. Fast tracking can lead to faster schedules. How-
ever, the risk is increased because the activity that normally
is a successor depends on the output of its predecessor,
and if that output is not as expected, the successor activity
may need to be reworked.
Several alternative methods of scheduling can be
used by themselves or combined with traditional
236
Part 2 Planning Projects

scheduling and resourcing. These methods include crit-
ical chain, reverse phase, rolling wave, agile, and auto/
manual
scheduling.
Experienced
project
managers
attempt to use the best ideas from several of these
alternative approaches.
Project scheduling software such as Microsoft Proj-
ect is extremely useful when determining the resources
for a project. This software helps pinpoint exactly when
each worker is needed, for what activity, and where
there are overloads. Despite the power of these sched-
uling systems, they do not make all of the decisions for
a project. The project manager needs to understand the
output of the software and may be able to ask a number
of what-if questions. Ultimately, the project manager
needs to make the decisions—often in conjunction
with the sponsor.

Exercises
1.
A certain project has three activities on its critical
path. Activity A’s normal completion time is five
days. It can be crashed to three days at a cost of
$500. Activity B’s normal completion time is six
days, and it can be crashed to four days at a cost
of $50. Activity C’s normal completion time is
eight days. It can be crashed to three days at a
cost of $1,000. Which activity should the project
manager crash and by how many days? How
much will it cost?
2.
Using the data for Problem 08.02, create the
project schedule using normal times. Determine
the order in which you would crash the project
one day, two days, and so on until it is in an all-
crash mode. Identify how much it would cost for
each day you crash the schedule.

Managing Software Development with Agile Methods and Scrum
The Scrum process was described for use in agile
software development by Ken Schwaber and Mike
Beedle. Exhibit 8.21 illustrates the Scrum process.
In practice, many agile methods and variations are
utilized, but they all share a basis in iterative
development, extensive verbal communication, team
interaction, and the reduction of resource-intensive
intermediate products. Agile software development
methods attempt to minimize risk via short time boxes
called iterations or Sprints. Typically, the time boxes
are from one to a maximum of four weeks and usually
include numerous subtasks. Each Sprint is frequently
like a software development project in and of itself and
includes planning, requirements analysis, design,

coding, testing, documentation, and validation of
deliverables. Some iterations may generate new
products or capabilities, but most are integrated into
larger groups to be released as new products.
Scalability is one of the benefits of the approach,
and another is the opportunity to reevaluate priorities
in an incremental fashion. This technique, therefore,
can be used effectively for software maintenance
and enhancements, as well as new product
development.
Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master who
organizes the project like any good project manager.
This person has the primary task of removing
impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the
Sprint goal and project objectives. The scrum master is
not necessarily the leader of the team in the traditional
formal sense (as the teams are self-organizing), but
acts as a productivity buffer between the team and any
destabilizing influences. This encourages the
emergence of informal leadership and team
cohesiveness. Scrum includes the following elements,
which define the process:
•
A
dynamic
backlog
of
prioritized
work
to
be
accomplished
•
The use of short iterations or Sprints
•
A brief daily meeting or Scrum session during
which progress is explained, upcoming work is
described, and impediments are identified and if
possible immediately resolved
•
A brief planning session during which the prioritized
backlog of items for the Sprint is identified and fur-
ther defined by the team
•
A
brief
retrospective
during
which
all
team
members reflect about the past Sprint and any
design or other influences on future Sprints or
objectives
This approach keeps everyone on the team engaged
and focused. It works very well when everyone is
co-located to facilitate verbal communications, but has
been shown to work well in virtual teams or
geographically dispersed teams as well. The emphasis
on verbal communications has proven to be
particularly useful for international teams where
written communications alone may not be clearly
understood. The use of video conferencing and virtual
development environments is also beneficial in these
situations.
Agile software development teams include all
resources necessary to accomplish the tasks and finish
the software product. This includes designers,
architects, analysts, testers, technical writers,
managers, and customers (the people who define the
final product).
The primary metric for progress in this environment
is working software based on the scope as identified in
the Sprints. Schedules and other resources are based
on accomplishing the Sprints and removing
impediments. With their preference for verbal
communications, agile methods produce little written
documentation relative to other methods. That is not to
say that the team produces no documentation, as it is
important to have requirements, design, and other
aspects of the software product documented to
facilitate maintenance and support and in some cases
to meet industry regulatory compliance requirements.
This reduced emphasis on documentation has resulted
in criticism of agile methods as undisciplined or, as
some have called it, “cowboy coding.” As a rule, this
does not seem to be the case in practice because, if
properly implemented, the requirements are
documented in the prioritized backlog; the design is
documented in the Sprints and Scrum sessions; and
the testing, user, and technical documents complete
the documentation set. It is important to note that the
use of a scribe during Scrum sessions, planning, or
retrospective sessions is vital to capture what is
transpiring, since the sessions tend to be short and
intense by nature.
Many companies have now embraced the agile
methods to reduce development time, foster
innovation, and reduce development risk. One
example is a Seattle-based company that has utilized
Scrum to shorten development cycle time and
improve quality for software deliveries to its clients. It
uses Sprints to group similar requirements and
provide a two-week window of work for its
developers. Daily Scrum sessions help it stay focused
and deal immediately with impediments. This works
ideally, in that it keeps task scope to a minimum for
the developers, and everyone on the team is aware of
what is transpiring throughout the development
process. This has shortened development time and
led to more rapid release of products and
enhancements to the clients, thus reducing
development costs and improving margins.
Chapter 8 Resourcing Projects

Another example is an Ohio company that utilizes
agile methods and Scrum for software development for
clients in the highly regulated pharmaceutical, bio-tech,
and medical device industries. A recent software system
developed to be used in manufacturing data acquisition
and control for products requiring complete traceability,
including raw materials and processes, was designed
and developed in five months to beta delivery. The
software will ultimately track and control all of the
company’s production when fully implemented. The
system was put into a pilot manufacturing line. It was
working within thirty minutes of software installation
and processed product through the pilot production
facility the same day without a glitch. The system was
delivered essentially bug-free. This was unheard of
previously using traditional development methods and
would have taken a year or more to get to beta delivery,
with many more issues. The company accounts for this
success due to the use of the agile process, Scrum, and
thorough quality testing. The requirements in this
regulated environment were developed in a traditional
manner; however, once the requirements were
approved by the client management, the Scrum
approach was used, which represented a departure from
the traditional waterfall approach. Each module of the
system was developed separately using the Scrum
approach by focusing on developing a few design
elements at a time rather than trying to focus on the
entire system design at once. In this way, the
development team could focus and accomplish a few
things at a time and leave the big picture design and
architecture to the scrum master and development
management. Use of this approach exceeded all
expectations.11

Budgeting Projects
I sold escalators and elevators for my first job out of business school. As part
of my training, before I was sent to the field, I would look over the estimates
made by the sales staff. This served to double-check their math so the
company had confidence in their estimates. It also served to teach me many
of the little nuances that more experienced estimators used. I had my training
manuals, lists of standards, main methods of calculation, and so forth, but
learning from others’ experience instead of making all my own mistakes
helped.
One of the last parts in my training was to spend eight weeks at the
Denver branch to get seasoned a little bit. Construction was booming in
Denver during the late 1970s. In fact, some days I needed to bid more than
one job. The first part of putting together a bid was to go the office where
the requests for proposals, plans, specifications, and the like were stored.
Then, armed with that information, I would put together an estimate. Finally,

the actual bidding took place—usually over the phone. The problem was that
creating a detailed estimate would generally take at least half a day. If that
was my only duty (it was not), I would still have had a hard time when
multiple jobs were let for bid on the same day. Something had to give.
Every morning around 10 A.M., I met the construction superintendent for
coffee. We would discuss each bid that was due. What other job was it like?
How was it bigger or smaller than a recently completed job? What features
did it include more or less than a previous job? Did we make money on that
job? We used these questions to compare an upcoming job to other recently
completed jobs. We would also ask, “What do we think our competition will
bid?” By the end of the conversation, we had determined our strategy for
bidding the job. If we won the bid, we would complete a detailed cost
estimate to see if we were close.
After my training, I was transferred to Kansas City. Kansas City had less
construction than Denver. I had enough time to perform detailed cost
estimates before I submitted bids. Therefore, we were more certain that if
we got the bid, we would have a good chance of making money.
I worked for the same company in both cities. However, we used two very
different methods of estimating cost. Both made sense where they were used.
In Denver, if we wanted to bid every job (and you cannot win the job if you do
not bid on it), we needed a fast method. In Kansas City, we had the time to
develop detailed cost estimates, and so we took the time. There are many
methods of estimating project costs and each has its place.

9-1 Plan Cost Management
This chapter starts with estimating project costs. Once the overall cost is estimated, the
next step is to develop the budget by aggregating the costs and determining the project’s
cash flow needs. Project managers also need to establish a system to report and control
project costs. The final chapter section deals with how to use Microsoft Project to aid in
cost management activities.
Cost and schedule are closely related. Sometimes, the two move in the same direction.
For example, when a schedule calls for materials to be delivered, or for workers to
perform, money needs to be available to pay for the materials or workers. Sometimes,
they move in opposite directions. For example, if a project needs to be completed earlier
than planned, more money will probably need to be found to pay for overtime.
Plan cost management is “the process that establishes the policies, procedures, and
documentation for planning, managing, expending, and controlling project costs.”1 Cost
planning entails developing a cost management plan for your project. The cost manage-
ment plan is “a component of the project management plan that describes how costs will
be planned, structured, and controlled.”2 On small projects, this can be as simple as
ensuring accurate estimates are made, securing the funding, and developing cost report-
ing procedures to ensure that the money is spent correctly. On large projects, each of
these processes can be much more involved; in addition, developing and using accurate
cash flow estimates become critical. A project cost management plan includes descrip-
tions, procedures, and responsibilities for:
•
Costs included (such as internal and external, contingency, etc.),
•
Activity resource estimating,
•
Cost estimating,
•
Budget determination, and
•
Cost control, including metrics, reporting, and change approvals.
A project cost management plan needs to be consistent with the methods of
the parent organization. In many organizations, project managers are provided
with specific guidance on setting up their cost management plan. The plan provides
guidance to the project manager and other stakeholders in order to serve several
purposes:
•
First and most fundamentally, it shows how to develop and share relevant, accurate,
and timely information that the project manager, sponsor, and other stakeholders
can use to make intelligent and ethical decisions.
•
It provides feedback, thereby showing how the project’s success is linked to the
business objectives for which it was undertaken.
•
It provides information at a detailed level for those who need details and at
appropriate summary levels for those who need that.
•
It helps all project stakeholders focus appropriately on schedule and performance
as well as cost.3
9-2 Estimate Cost
Estimate cost is “the process of developing an approximation of the monetary resources
needed to complete project activities.”4 Cost estimating is linked closely with scope,
schedule, and resource planning. To understand cost well, a project manager needs to
understand what the work of the project includes, what schedule demands exist, and
what people and other resources can be used. As more of this detail becomes known,
the cost estimates can be more precise.
246
Part 2 Planning Projects

The first principle in dealing with project costs is for the project manager to never lie
to himself. Many times, in dealing with project costs, the project manager will need to
negotiate with sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders. If he does not understand
what the project costs really are, he is just trading meaningless numbers. That is neither
an effective nor an ethical method of establishing and committing to sensible budgets.
The second principle in dealing with project costs is for the project manager to never
lie to anyone else. Since sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders can often drive hard
bargains, it is sometimes tempting to shade the truth to secure necessary funding. This is
wrong on two counts. First, it is ethically wrong. Second, as a practical matter, a project
manager’s reputation goes a long way for good or for bad. People are more inclined to
work with project managers who are viewed as being honest and trustworthy.
To estimate project costs accurately, the project manager must understand the various
types of cost, the timing and accuracy of cost estimates, the different methods that can
be employed to estimate costs, and a variety of cost estimating issues.
9-2a Types of Cost
Costs can be better understood by considering various types of classifications such as
those shown in Exhibit 9.1.
FIXED VERSUS VARIABLE COSTS Cost can first be classified as either being fixed or var-
iable. Fixed costs are those that remain the same regardless of the size or volume of work. For
example, if you need to buy a computer for your project, the cost is the same regardless of
how much you use it. Variable costs are those that vary directly with volume of use. For
example, if you were building a cement wall, the cost of the cement would vary directly
with the size of the wall. To understand the importance of fixed versus variable costs, a proj-
ect manager ideally structures costs and the impact of changes on those costs. When a project
manager understands how big a project is likely to be, she will try to determine how to
complete all of the project work for the least cost. On many projects, there are choices of
how to perform certain activities. Some of these choices reflect a high-fixed-cost and low-
variable-cost alternative such as buying an expensive machine that can make parts with low
variable costs versus a more manual process of inexpensive machines but high labor costs.
These choices require both some fixed and some variable costs. Ideally, the cost curve for

Chapter 9 Budgeting Projects
247

the expected project volume appears as shown in Exhibit 9.2. This reflects the lowest possible
total cost at the size the project is expected to be. Unfortunately, problems may occur if the
volume of the project work is substantially larger or smaller than first expected. If the volume
drops a little bit, the total costs may drop very little. If the volume expands a little, the costs
may go up significantly. Therefore, when considering fixed and variable cost choices, it is
important to understand the project scope.
DIRECT VERSUS INDIRECT COSTS A second classification divides project costs into
direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are those that only occur because of the project
and are often classified as either direct labor or other direct costs. For example, direct
labor includes workers who are hired specifically to work on the project and who will
be either assigned to a new project or released when the project is complete. Other direct
costs may include such items as materials, travel, consultants, subcontracts, purchased
parts, and computer time.
Indirect costs are those that are necessary to keep the organization running, but are
not associated with one specific project. The salaries of the company executives and
the cost of company buildings, utilities, insurance, and clerical assistance are examples.
These costs are allocated among all of the projects and other work that benefit from
them. The methods of allocating these costs have evolved in recent years thanks to
activity-based costing, as described in the cost estimating issues section. Exhibit 9.3
shows both direct and indirect costs for a work package.
RECURRING VERSUS NONRECURRING COSTS The third cost comparison is recur-
ring versus nonrecurring costs. Recurring costs are those that repeat as the project work
continues, such as the cost of writing code or laying bricks. Nonrecurring costs are those
that happen only once during a project, such as developing a design that, once approved,
guides the project team. Nonrecurring costs tend to occur during project planning and
closing, while recurring costs tend to occur during project execution.
REGULAR VERSUS EXPEDITED COSTS A fourth cost comparison is regular or
expedited. Regular costs are preferred and occur when progress can be made by normal
work hours and purchasing agreements. Expedited costs occur when the project must be
conducted faster than normal and overtime for workers and/or extra charges for rapid

delivery from suppliers are necessary. The comparison of these costs shows why it is vital
to understand schedule pressures and resource demands as costs are estimated.
OTHER COST CLASSIFICATIONS The next several cost comparisons require little
explanation. They are helpful to understand both in structuring the cost estimates and as
checklists to help remember items that may be forgotten. One comparison is costs internal
to the parent organization versus those external to it. Major external cost items such as equip-
ment can be either leased or purchased. Direct cost items are often labor or materials.
Estimate versus reserve costs form the next comparison. The estimate is “a quantified
assessment of the likely amount… It should always include an indication of accuracy.”5
The reserve is “a provision in the project management plan to mitigate cost and/or
schedule risk. Often used with a modifier (e.g., management reserve, contingency
reserve) to provide further detail on what types of risk are meant to be mitigated.”6
Management reserve is “an amount of the project budget withheld for management
control purposes… for unforeseen work that is within the scope.”7 By contrast, contin-
gency reserve is “budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for identified risks that
are accepted and for which contingent or mitigating responses are developed.”8
Just as uncertainly exists when estimating how long an activity will take, there is
uncertainty regarding how much an activity will cost. Some activities are easy to estimate with
precision. Other less familiar activities have many uncertainties, and estimating their cost is
more like guessing. If one were to estimate conservatively on each uncertain activity, the
total estimate for the project would likely be too high to be approved. To overcome this problem,
project managers are encouraged to estimate at least a bit more aggressively. That means some
activities will run over their estimates, while others will cost less. Project managers frequently
add contingency reserve to cover the activities that run over their aggressive estimates.

9-2b Accuracy and Timing of Cost Estimates
Project managers need to understand when cost estimates should be developed, how
accurate they need to be, and how they will be used. During project initiation, many
project managers need to develop cost estimates to have their project charters approved. At
this point, very little detail is understood regarding the project, so the estimates are only
approximate. However, as the scope becomes well defined in the work breakdown structure
(WBS), schedules are planned, and specific resources are assigned, the project manager
knows much more and can estimate more precisely. Many organizations have specific
names and guidance for their estimates and these vary widely. Normally, estimates should
be documented, and the level of confidence in the estimate should be described. Exhibit 9.4
shows several points regarding different types of project cost estimates.
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ESTIMATES Several things should be noted from these com-
parisons. First, estimates go by several different names. For example, order of magnitude
estimates that are often used to seek initial charter approval are also sometimes called “ball
park,” “conceptual,” “initial,” or “level-one” estimates. These early estimates are often created
during the project initiating stage when very little detail is known about the project. At this
point, a very rough order of magnitude estimate that could underestimate the project by as
much as 100 percent (that is, the final cost could be double the initial estimate) may be
the only possible estimate. There is no way to really know how accurate an estimate is
until the project has been completed, but with less detailed knowledge concerning the project
in the initiating stage, there is likely to be a larger margin of error. Order of magnitude cost
estimates and the parallel high-level looks at each of the other planning areas can quickly give
enough information to decide whether to approve the project charter and begin to invest time
and money into detailed planning.

BUDGET AND DEFINITIVE ESTIMATES Once a project manager enters into the more
detailed planning stage, it is generally possible to create a more accurate cost estimate. This
is the same thought that goes into creating a more detailed project schedule, resource
estimates, risk profiles, quality plans, and communications plans. Depending on the complex-
ity and size of their projects and organizational norms, some project managers can proceed
directly to definitive cost estimates at this point. Others may still need to look at one or more
intermediate levels of detail before they have enough detailed knowledge to create cost
estimates with accuracy. At the end of project planning, cost estimates should have a small
enough margin of error that they can be used to create a project budget, show cash flow
needs, and be used as a basis for controlling the project. Most project organizations want an
accuracy level of no more than plus or minus 10 to 15 percent, and some require consider-
ably better, such as plus or minus 5 percent.
Especially on complex projects such as research and development of major new
products, project managers may use rolling wave planning to estimate costs. They do
this by creating a definitive estimate for the first stage of the project (and committing
to it) and an order of magnitude estimate for the remainder of the project. As the work
on the first stage proceeds, the project manager then creates a definitive estimate for the
second stage and reevaluates the order of magnitude estimate for the remainder of the
project. At each stage, the project manager has more information than at the preceding
stage and can create more accurate estimates.
9-2c Methods of Estimating Costs
Many methods can be used for estimating project costs. Most of the methods are varia-
tions of one of the following techniques. While these methods can sometimes also be
used to estimate project scope or duration, in this chapter the discussion centers on
using them to estimate project cost. Exhibit 9.4 indicates that as more details of a project
are known as planning progresses, more detailed estimating methods may be used.
However, Exhibit 9.5 shows that even at the end of project planning, a project manager

may sometimes use a combination of cost estimating
methods. If the organization has accurate enough
analogous and parametric estimating methods and
capable estimators, sometimes portions of a project
can be estimated by those methods instead of the
more detailed (and time-consuming) bottom-up
methods. The method used should account for the
extent of complexity, risk, interdependencies, work
force specialization, and site-specific issues of the
project.9
ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING Analogous estimat-
ing is “a technique for estimating the duration or
cost of an activity or a project using historical data
from a similar project.”10 Analogous estimating was
the method used in Denver in this chapter’s open-
ing vignette. To create a bid for a project—in this
case, the installation of elevators—a similar project was considered as the starting
point. Immediately, questions were asked regarding how this job compared in size
and complexity with the previous job. Several things need to be in place for analogous
estimates to be effective. First, the organization needs to have experience in performing
similar projects and know how much each of those projects actually cost (not just what
they were estimated to cost). Second, the estimator needs to know how the proposed
project differs from the previous project. Third, the estimator needs to have experience
with the methods by which the project will be performed. In the example, sales and
construction people jointly discussed how much the project would cost.
PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING Parametric estimating is “an estimating technique in
which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based on historical data and
project parameters.”11 A bit more information is needed to complete a parametric cost
estimate. Exhibit 9.5 shows this graphically by suggesting that another level of detail
in the WBS might be used. In the chapter opener example of estimating the cost of
elevator installation projects, parametric estimates might involve finding a bit more
information regarding the project. For example, one might want to know how tall
the elevator was, how fast it needed to travel, how large the platform would be, the
trim level, the complexity of the controls, and the like. Each of those factors would
have an impact on the elevator installation cost. For example, the cost per foot trav-
eled might be calculated (this would cover the cost of providing and installing guide
rails, wiring, etc.). Another cost might be associated with speed because faster eleva-
tors require bigger motors, more stability, stronger brakes, and so on.
BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING Bottom-up estimating is “a method of estimating project
duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower-level components of the
WBS.”12 For a bottom-up estimate, the WBS needs to be broken down to the most
detailed level, and the specifications need to be very clear. In the elevator example,
bottom-up estimates were created in Kansas City. Details to be estimated included
exactly how many buttons the control panel had, exactly what kind of light fixtures
were mounted in the ceiling, what kind of finish was requested, and so on. The cost
was estimated for each item. For example, for the process of installing the guide rail, first
Parametric estimating can be used to determine the impact of
variables on project costs.

there was a small amount of time, such as one hour, to set up or get everything in place
to do this step. Then, it took a certain fraction of an hour of labor to secure each foot of
the rail into position. A material charge was incurred for the guide rails themselves and
the fasteners that held them in place. The cost of supervision was charged for the fore-
person who ensured the work was scheduled and performed properly. Finally, overhead
costs (indirect costs) were allocated to each dollar of fixed costs.
Bottom-up estimating is the most detailed, time-consuming, and potentially accurate
way to estimate. Many projects use this method eventually to serve as a basis for estimat-
ing cash flow needs and for controlling the project. One important caution on bottom-
up estimating is to ensure that every item is included. If a portion of the project is left
out, that portion is underestimated by 100 percent! Some organizations first create a
bottom-up estimate and then compare it to a top-down view to consider adjusting it if
the top-down view yields a much higher number. Exhibit 9.6 summarizes differences in
cost estimating methods.
9-2d Project Cost Estimating Issues
Regardless of what method is used to estimate project costs, several issues need to be
considered. Some of these issues are pertinent to all projects; others only pertain to
certain projects. These issues are shown in Exhibit 9.7.
SUPPORTING DETAIL Supporting detail for project cost estimates includes describing
the scope, method used to create the estimate, assumptions, constraints, and range of
possible outcomes. The project scope tends to be the least well defined at the project out-
set and becomes increasingly well-defined throughout project planning. Each estimate
should state exactly what scope it involves. Version control is critical for this.
The method used might be analogous, parametric, or bottom-up. The name of the
method and exactly how the method is used should be described.
When creating an estimate, many assumptions and constraints are used. Assumptions
should be outlined because two different people coming from two different backgrounds

may assume that two different things will happen. Even if everyone involved with plan-
ning a project assumes the same thing, it still may not happen. Assumptions that are not
true often cause more work or other problems for a project. As more detail becomes
known, a project manager may review assumptions with an eye toward uncovering
assumptions that have now proven to be false. When this happens, the project manager
can investigate any impact this may have on the project budget (and schedule and
scope). Examples of assumptions that may arise when estimating the cost of direct labor
might include the following:
•
Workers will be paid at the prevailing wage rate of $14 per hour.
•
Workers are already familiar in general with the technology being used on the
project.
•
Workers will be paid for 40 hours per week whether there is always that much work
for them or not.
•
Overtime will never be authorized.
•
The project schedule can be delayed if the only alternative is to pay overtime.
Constraints are also important to bring to the surface since they often dictate the
methods available for performing the project work. Examples of constraints include:
•
Only in-house workers will be used.
•
No extra space will be provided.
•
No extra budget will be allowed.
•
The current version of the XYZ software will be incorporated into the design.
The range of possible outcomes should always be stated with any project cost esti-
mate. If the range is not stated, people may lock onto the first number they hear. If the
actual project costs could be 100 percent higher than the order of magnitude estimate,
the project manager had better state that loud and clear, or she may find herself contin-
ually explaining why she is grossly over budget. In fact, many estimators resist giving an
order of magnitude estimate because they fear they will be held to it. A natural tension
exists between managers who try to effectively manage their departments by establishing
budgets as soon as possible and project managers who try to provide budget estimates as
late as possible (once they know more about the project).
CAUSES OF VARIATION There are many causes of variation in project costs. On rou-
tine projects using proven technology and an experienced and well-known project team,
the causes may be relatively few and easy to categorize. On other projects where some of
these factors are not true, more causes of uncertainty in project costs may exist, and
some of those may be from unknown sources. Statisticians classify variation as coming
from either normal or special causes, as shown in Exhibit 9.8.
Variation occurs in all work processes. The more routine a process is and the more work
is driven by machines, the less variation occurs. Projects, however, tend to have novel work
and high human interaction, so there are many opportunities for variation. Normal variation
comes from many small causes that are inherent in a work process. For instance, the variation
in the productivity of a programmer writing code could be from phone calls, instant mes-
sages, and in-person interruptions that occur each day. Special cause variation, on the other
hand, is when something out of the ordinary occurs. For example, a lightning strike could
cause such a large power surge that it overwhelms the normal protectors and destroys some
of the computers. Most causes of variation are of the normal variety, and improving work
methods (as discussed in Chapter 11) can help to reduce this type of variation. Special causes,
however, are handled more as risks as discussed in Chapter 10. Both types of variation add to
project costs and need to be considered.
254
Part 2 Planning Projects

VENDOR BID ANALYSIS On some projects, most or all of the cost is internal to the
parent organization. On other projects, a substantial portion of the budget goes to se-
curing services and supplies from vendors. Vendor bid analysis is used to determine
whether the price being asked by the vendors appears to be reasonable. If several ven-
dors compete for the work, it is reasonable to believe that the lowest responsible offer
is fair. In the absence of competition, however, other methods may be needed to en-
sure a fair price. On some items, prices are determined in the marketplace and re-
ported in business papers and websites for anyone to read. On specialized services
and products, one often must negotiate with a vendor. In the absence of any other
method, for an expensive item, a project manager may need to develop a should cost
estimate. That is, try to determine how much effort the vendor may need to expend
and add a fair profit margin to arrive at the price you believe the vendor should
charge.
VALUE ENGINEERING Value engineering is “an approach used to optimize project life
cycle costs, save time, increase profits, improve quality, expand market share, solve problems,
and/or use resources more effectively.”13 Value engineering can be a very powerful method of
double-checking all of the chosen methods for accomplishing work and the features of the
project deliverable. Frequently, stakeholders find a feature that was in the specifications costs
more money to create than they wish to pay. In a project to update an older church, the litur-
gical committee proposed many controls for special lighting that would only be used on
special occasions. The general contractor suggested simplifying the controls, while retaining
all of the new lights, at a savings of $100,000! While the liturgical committee was disap-
pointed, the church council readily agreed. Value engineering is so common in some indus-
tries that a separate stage is incorporated late in the project planning to ensure that time is
spent in this effort to reduce project cost and/or time and to improve project quality and/or
usefulness.

ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING (ABC) Another issue project managers need to under-
stand when estimating costs is what type of accounting system the organization uses.
Historically, most companies used functional-based accounting systems. When using
these systems, overhead (indirect) costs are assigned to a cost pool, which is allocated
to direct costs based most frequently on volume. When direct costs were a large
percentage of total costs, this made sense. In more contemporary times, indirect costs
form a much larger percentage of total costs, so careful allocation of them is neces-
sary both for selecting the projects that truly will contribute the most profit and for
ensuring a focus on controlling the highest costs. ABC is another accounting
approach, by which indirect costs are allocated to fixed costs based upon four different
types of drivers. The cost drivers are number of units produced (frequently, the only
method used in functional-based accounting), number of batches run, number of
product variations, and amount of facility utilized. ABC requires more involved
methods for allocating indirect costs, but yields more accurate cost information. By
furnishing more specific information on cost drivers, ABC also helps to support
process improvement and justify spending money on expensive equipment. Project
managers need to understand how costs are allocated in their organization so they
can accurately estimate the amount of indirect costs that will be assigned to their
projects.
LIFE CYCLE COSTING Life cycle costing is another concept project managers need to
understand when estimating their project costs. Many project selection decisions are
made based upon the total costs of both creating the project and of using the result of
the project during its useful life. This total cost is called the life cycle cost. Many times,
tradeoff decisions are considered that might involve spending more during the project to
create a product that costs less to operate during its useful life. In an age when environ-
mental concerns are appropriately being considered more heavily, to calculate total life
cycle costs, a project manager may also need to consider disposition costs of the product
after its useful life is complete. This can entail designing more recyclable parts (even at a
higher cost) into the product.
TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS
When considering costs in the future, project managers need to understand how to cal-
culate the time value of money. One dollar today is presumably worth more than one
dollar next year. Discounting the value of future revenue and cost streams to account
for this enables better project decisions. Project managers need to discount future dollars
by the appropriate factor. Often, the finance department at a company tells the project
manager what rate to use. The rate depends upon the underlying inflation rate plus the
cost of capital. On international projects, it can also depend upon international currency
fluctuations.
9-3 Determine Budget
Once the project costs have been estimated, it is time to establish the project budget.
Determine budget is “the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual
activities or work packages to establish an authorized cost baseline.”14 To develop
the budget, the project manager starts by aggregating all of the various costs. Once
those are totaled, it is time to determine how much money is required for reserve
funds. Finally, the project manager must understand cash flow—both in terms of
funding and requirements for costs.
256
Part 2 Planning Projects

9-3a Aggregating Costs
When the entire project costs, both direct and indirect, have been added up, the
result is a cost baseline, which is “the approved version of the time-phased project
budget, excluding any management reserves, which can be changed only through
formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparing actual
results.”15
The work packages that are identified when creating a WBS not only take time, but
they also cost money. The project budget can be aggregated from the work packages.
Exhibit 9.9 shows how six work packages appear on a Gantt chart with the cost of each
work package listed on a monthly basis. The total cost for the month is shown and the
cumulative cost for the project below that. Finally, a graph appears at the bottom that
shows the cumulative cost of the project at each point in time. This represents the
time-phased project budget. This will be used as the project progresses for control pur-
poses. Note the cumulative cost curve approximates an “S” shape with slow expenditures
(and progress) early in the project, rapid in the middle, and slow late in the project. This
is common as projects often require much planning early and have a variety of activities
to finish at the end.

9-3b Analyzing Reserve Needs
Another view of project cost variation is to consider how well it is understood and how
each type is handled. This is displayed in Exhibit 9.10.
Variation in project costs (and schedules) can be partially explained by the presence
of certain events. These events are classified as known knowns, known unknowns, or
unknown unknowns depending on the extent to which they are understood and
predicted. Known knowns are discovered during planning and can be estimated directly.
An example could be that when a construction crew takes soil samples, they discover
that extra pilings are required to stabilize the new building, and they add the cost into
the project estimate to cover that expense.
Known unknowns are events discovered during risk identification that may or may
not occur. An example could be snowstorms that cause traffic problems for three days
at a critical time, preventing workers from getting to their jobs. In the next chapter on
risk, methods for calculating this cost are shown. It will appear as contingency reserves.
Finally, sometimes things that are totally unexpected happen that cause an increase in
cost and/or schedule. For example, perhaps a very dependable supplier goes out of busi-
ness due to the sudden death of the owner. These unknown unknowns (commonly called
unk unks by people who have felt burned by them) also need to be covered in the project
budget. The money used to cover them is frequently called management reserve and is
usually authorized by company executives.
The amount placed into contingency reserve is calculated during risk analysis. The amount
placed into management reserve is determined by how much uncertainty management feels
exists in the project. Typical ranges are from 5 percent of project costs for a well-understood,
routine project to 30 percent or more of project costs for poorly understood, unusual projects.
These costs are not to be used to overcome poor estimating or project execution.
Once the cost baseline is determined and both contingency and management reserves
have been added, it is time to determine if sufficient funds are available. On many
potential projects, a funding limit exists. The project sponsor for internal projects and
the customer for external projects need to be very clear if the necessary funds exceed
the limit of what is available. If enough funds are not available, this is the time to look
hard at all of the estimates, schedule, and scope to determine what changes need to be
made before the project management plan is accepted. It does no good for anyone to
deliberately start a project with insufficient funds.
9-3c Determining Cash Flow
Projects require cash to keep moving. Suppliers and workers need to be paid in a timely
fashion. The difficulty that sometimes occurs is that the project’s customer may not pay
for the work until it is completed—often months after project bills need to be paid.
Therefore, the timing of cash coming in and going out for a project is just as important
as the amount of money required.

Part 2 Planning Projects

Just as the demands on individual workers can be applied to individual activities in
the project schedule to determine where overloads may occur, expenses can be applied
to individual activities in the schedule to see when cash is needed. Revenue can also
be tracked to interim deliverables in the project schedule to show when revenue can
be expected. If a project is internal to a company, the timing of cash availability is
also important to understand. While workers may work every day and suppliers
may deliver frequently, cash may be supplied through organizational budgets only on
a periodic basis. A project manager needs to ensure that the cumulative amount of
cash coming into the project either from internal budgeting or from customer pay-
ments meets or exceeds the demands for paying cash out. This cash flow is shown in
Exhibit 9.11 where incoming cash is in large increments, yet outgoing cash is almost
continuous. The cumulative revenue at project completion minus the cumulative cost
at project completion equals the profit (or surplus) generated by the project.
9-4 Establishing Cost Control
The approved project budget with contingency reserves (and any amount of manage-
ment reserve that has already been approved) serves as a baseline for project control.
The budget shows both how much progress is expected and how much funding is
required at each point in time. These are used for establishing project control. Control
cost is “the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs
and managing changes to the cost baseline.”16 Cost control is discussed in Chapter 14.
When establishing cost control, a typical measuring point is a milestone. Major mile-
stones are often identified in the milestone schedule in the project charter, and additional
milestones may be identified in constructing the project schedule. Project managers can
use the cash flow projections they have made to determine how much funding they
expect to need to reach each milestone. This can then be used for determining how
well the project is progressing. The sponsor and project manager often jointly determine
how many milestones to use. They want enough milestones to keep track of progress, but
not so many that they become an administrative burden. Microsoft Project and other
software can be used to automate the cost reporting.

9-5 Using MS Project for Project Budgets
MS Project supports both bottom-up and summary level cost modeling. Bottom-up cost
modeling is primarily based on the cost of each resource assignment. Assignment costs
are totaled in the related activity’s Cost field. The resulting activity costs are summarized
in the parent WBS levels.
Summary level cost modeling consists of a summary level estimate for all the effort
represented by that level, with no underlying detail entered. This can be helpful when
the detail is not known, but the schedule must provide an overview of the entire
estimated time and cost schedule.
9-5a Develop Bottom-Up Project Budget
To develop a bottom-up project budget, a project manager needs to understand four
things: assignment costs, activity costs, project total costs, and the different perspectives
from which to view costs.
ASSIGNMENT COSTS The following data are used to compute each assignment’s
cost value:
•
Assignment work hours—calculated when the work assignment is made (Assign-
ment units × Resource calendar hours per each day of the activity duration)
•
Resource standard rate
•
Resource overtime rate (only if modeling overtime)
An assignment cost value is the total number of assignment hours times the standard
rate. Each resource has a standard cost rate, and some resources may have an overtime
cost rate as well. These can be assigned when defining the resource as described in
Chapter 8, or assigned later as shown in Exhibit 9.12.
ACTIVITY COSTS The activity cost value is the sum of all assignment cost values plus
any activity fixed cost value as shown in Exhibit 9.13, which displays the Task Usage
view in the top pane (with the Cost column inserted) and the Resource Work form in
the lower pane.
In Exhibit 9.13, row 12 is a summary. Rows 9, 10, 11, and 13 are activities. The
unnumbered rows are assignments. Row 9 is the activity “Prepare budgets.” Patrick is
scheduled to work 30 hours on that activity. Remembering his cost rate is $30 per
hour, it is possible to see how the cost is totaled. The assignment Units and Work values

for some of the “Select Trip Issues & Sites” activity are shown in the lower pane. To
generate the Task Usage view with Resource Work form:
1. On the Task tab, View group, enter Task Usage.
2. On the View tab, Split View group, click Details.
3. On the View tab, Split View group, enter Task Form (if not already displayed).
4. Right click in the form in the lower page and enter “Work.”
5. In the upper pane, expose the Start column and right click in the Start column
header to add a column. Enter “Cost” when prompted.
VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES The preceding discussion has been from the view of the
WBS perspective. Cost data may also be viewed from a resource perspective, using the
Resource Usage view. In this view, assignment costs are summarized at the resource
level.
In Exhibit 9.14, the most indented rows are activities. The “Unassigned” set represents
activities with no assigned resources. Resources with no show/hide control have no
assignments. The zoom scale is set to month over weeks.
9-5b Develop Summary Project Budget
Early in planning, sometimes detail is not yet known for later project phases. However,
stakeholders still want an ongoing projection of the completion date and cost. A solution
is to add a dummy activity under each phase summary for which not enough informa-
tion to plan in detail is known yet. Estimate both the phase duration and the phase cost.
Put the duration estimate in the dummy activity’s Duration field. Put the cost estimate in
the dummy activity’s Cost field. Remember to remove each dummy activity when detail
is added.
On agile projects, it is common to use a dummy activity to summarize the work for
future iterations that is not yet defined. Since the number of workers is often known and
the length of the iteration is known, the amount of cost can be seen, but the exact work
activities are only determined in iteration planning.

Summary
The cost management plan outlines how to structure and
control project costs. On a small project, it can be very
simple. On a large, complex project, it may need more
structure. It guides the project manager during the project.
Cost estimating can be challenging because some
activities may have a great deal of variation. Many
methods are available to assist in cost estimating. Use
a simple method if it will suffice, and more rigor if
necessary. Generally as project planning identifies
more specifics, more detailed and accurate cost esti-
mates can be made.

supplies rates for workers, use those. Approximate rates for
ones you cannot get. Ask your sponsor how they treat
indirect costs. Be sure to include direct labor costs for your-
self and your teammates. Budget your costs at the starting
salary you expect to receive when you graduate (or your
current salary if you are employed). Divide your annual
salary by 2,080 hours and add 20 percent for fringe. State
all assumptions and constraints you have used when
creating your budget. State how confident you are in
your estimates and what would make you more confident.
Give examples of known knowns and known unknowns
on your project. Tell how you have budgeted for both of
them as well as how you have budgeted for unknown
unknowns.

The Value of Budget Optimization
At a major midwestern electric utility, budgeting for the
ongoing capital expansion of the electric power system
represents a process at the core of the organization’s
strategy and operations. During extensive annual
planning efforts, a three-year capital project portfolio is
developed for implementation and budgeted. The
budgeting process is used to ensure that available
capital is carefully scrutinized by management and
applied judiciously to those projects providing the
greatest strategic value on a schedule minimizing
overall risk. Maintaining the forecasted budget and
completing projects as planned ensures the integrity of
the electrical system and the financial strength of the
business.
The budgeting process itself is actually conducted
year-round as planners, engineers, project managers,
and financial experts endeavor to balance multiple
competing objectives into a rational, achievable, and
ongoing capital spending plan. There is little margin for
error. Annual spending for major capital projects is
typically over $250 million, representing approximately
500 projects to be completed across a five-state area.
Underbudgeting means that projects potentially critical
to the reliability of the electrical network may not be
completed. Overbudgeting could result in investment
dollars not yielding a return and reducing earnings.
As with any enterprise, the electric utility capital
budget is restricted by annual spending targets
necessary to maintain prudent financial ratios. In the
case of capital spending, one key element involves
maintaining a targeted debt-to-equity ratio. For this
reason, judgments need to be made about the cost
versus the value of projects considered for investment
and the risks associated with potentially postponing
projects to maintain favorable financial ratios.
To enable this entire process to work continuously
and effectively, the utility adopted a project portfolio
optimization process to create, analyze, and refine the
budget for the project portfolio. This process involves
executive management in creating a strategic value
and risk scoring methodology that is applied during the
planning phase for each project. The method assigns a
value and risk score based on each individual project’s
forecasted impact in five critical strategic areas:
financial, reliability, customer, regulatory, and system
operations. A computer-based mathematical algorithm
266
Part 2 Planning Projects

is used to optimize all possible spending portfolios to
maximize value and minimize risk at specified budget
levels. Within hours, the utility can analyze multiple
optimized budget scenarios at various annual spending
levels involving thousands of projects and nearly
$1 billion of investment.
This methodology has several key benefits for the
electric utility that can be applied to any organization
attempting to make budgeting decisions for complex
project portfolios.
•
Budget strategy well understood and communi-
cated through the organization—The process starts
with an annual review by executive management of
the strategy categories to which value and risk
assessments will be applied. These categories and
relative importance weightings can be adjusted to
match the organization’s current strategic emphasis.
These categories and their relative weightings are
published, communicated, and used throughout the
organization.
•
Budget
optimized
for
strategic
objectives—The
scores of value and risk for each project are applied
to the strategy categories and optimized to provide
maximum value and minimum risk for the capital
spending
available.
Computer
software
allows
instant scenario changes and what-if options to be
analyzed. The outcome provides management with
consistent
and
well-understood
decision-making
information.
•
Consistent
organizational
strategy
ensured—
Projects are submitted for budget consideration in
the capital portfolio from throughout the utility’s
five-state operating area. There is a diverse array
of business and financial reasons for each project
to be evaluated. The use of a single enterprise-
wide tool allows all projects to be analyzed on an
equal basis, providing assurance that the organiza-
tional strategy is universally applied.
•
Risk
thresholds
and
tolerance
understood—
Postponing projects to conserve capital brings with it
certain risks. The budget optimization process pro-
vides detailed risk analysis information on all deferred
projects. Widespread communication of these risks
and expert analysis of the consequences and probabil-
ity allow management to make calculated and care-
fully considered decisions. Importantly, management
gains recognition of its own risk tolerance and risk
threshold levels as a result.
•
Planning horizon and purchasing power expanded—
The most significant result of the budget optimiza-
tion process is the certainty with which implementa-
tion (the project execution phase) of the budget plan
can be approached. The high levels of up-front man-
agement scrutiny leave little doubt about executive
support for the plan going forward. This enables the
planning horizon to be significantly expanded into
future years and brings with it an enormous level
of labor and material purchasing power in the
market.
•
Project dynamics accounted for—Although the three-
year budget plan is updated annually, there are still ele-
ments of uncertainty associated with implementation
of a large project portfolio. These changes might be
items such as significant shifts in public policy or reg-
ulations, fundamental changes to the business model,
unexpected weather events, and so on. These mid-
stream shifts can be dealt with readily, if needed, by
changing project scoring criteria, reoptimizing the proj-
ect mix, and reevaluating the resulting information for
options going forward.

projects will add facilities that will be staffed by up to 27,000 additional
employees. When complete, TMC will have 40 million square feet of occupied
space. If you consider downtown business space, by itself it forms the seventh
largest downtown business district in the United States.
With hurricane season approaching, TMC held a conference for over 100
contractors to review how to prepare for a potential hurricane. Contractors
must have a plan in place detailing how they are going to secure their
construction sites and keep materials from becoming airborne missiles in the
event of a hurricane. Conference attendees were given a handout describing
TMC’s hurricane guidelines. These guidelines call for storm preparations to
be completed twenty-four hours before tropical storm winds are predicted to
hit land. Examples of storm preparations include dismantling scaffolds and
privacy screens, securing giant cranes, emptying and weighting down
dumpsters, photographing all buildings and assets, and unblocking all
streets for emergency access.
While project managers cannot prevent hurricanes, through careful risk
planning, actions can be taken to greatly mitigate the impact.
Rhonda Wendler, Texas Medical Center News
Imagine you are asked to plan for risks on two different projects. One is a major con-
struction project at TMC with hurricane season approaching. The other is planning a
small fund-raising event for charity. Would you handle the risks on these two projects
the same way? Would you invest the same level of time and energy into planning these
two projects? The answers are yes and no. Yes, you would approach the risks in the
same way. But you would not spend the same amount of time planning for risk on
both projects. You would spend considerably more time and money on risk management
planning for the major construction project that is vulnerable to a hurricane than for the
small fund-raiser project. Just as in other types of project planning, there is an approach
to planning for risks that all projects follow; however, the depth of planning depends
greatly on the potential risks of the project. In other words, a smart project manager
gladly spends $100 in risk planning to save $1,000 in expected consequences, but does
not gladly spend $1,000 to save $100.
The purpose of risk management is to reduce the overall project risk to a level that
is acceptable to the project sponsor and other stakeholders. The methods that project

managers use in risk management start with identifying as many risks as possible. Once the
risks are identified, each risk is analyzed so that the project team can concentrate their atten-
tion on the most critical risks. Analysis always consists of a qualitative or judgmental
approach and sometimes also includes a quantitative approach. In the final risk manage-
ment process, the project team decides how to respond to each potential risk. Once all
of the risk management planning has initially been accomplished, the response plans are
incorporated into the overall project management plan. Changes may need to be made to
the schedule, budget, scope, or communication plans to account for certain risks. These
risk management planning processes are covered in this chapter. Risk management also
includes monitoring and controlling the risks according to plan. These are covered, along
with ongoing risk planning, in Chapter 14, Determining Project Progress and Results.
On agile projects, while early risk planning, assessment, and response planning is similar
at a high level, more detailed and timely risk management occurs in three places: in planning
each subsequent iteration, in daily stand-up meetings, and in retrospectives at the end of
each iteration.
10-1 Plan Risk Management
Plan risk management is “the process of defining how to conduct risk management
activities for a project.”1 To plan for project risks, a project manager must first under-
stand the project’s objectives. A project manager develops this understanding initially
by realizing what project success in general is and then by understanding the specific
priorities of the most important project stakeholders, as discussed in Chapter 5.
Exhibit 10.1 summarizes current project success research results.
The first set of general project success measures is meeting agreements. This includes
meeting the technical requirements while not going over the cost and schedule agreements.
The second set of project success measures focuses on the project’s customers. Specifically,
did the project result meet the customers’ needs, was the project result used by the custo-
mers, and did it enhance the customers’ satisfaction? The third set deals with the future of
the performing organization. The specific measures in this area vary, but essentially they ask
whether the project helped the performing organization. The performing organization is
“an enterprise whose personnel are most directly involved in doing the work of the
project.”2 Typical measures here include market share, new markets and/or technologies,
and commercial success of the project output. The final set of project success measures deals
with the project team. Did they become better and more dedicated employees?

Part 2 Planning Projects

The specific priorities of the project’s most important stakeholders can be summa-
rized in a table such as Exhibit 10.2. A project manager and team need to understand not
only what the project plans call for but also what area(s) the most important
stakeholders would like to improve and what area(s) they are willing to sacrifice to
enable those improvements. For example, consider a project that calls for building a
four-bedroom house of 2,800 square feet. Perhaps the homeowner (the most important
stakeholder) insists on keeping the size at 2,800 square feet and insists on the normal
quality (no leaks, square walls, etc.), but would like to improve on the cost (pay less
money). To improve on the cost objective, one of the other objectives probably needs to
be sacrificed. Perhaps the homeowner would be willing to move in a month late if the
savings were $5,000.
Once the project team understands the project success measures and priorities, atten-
tion is turned to understanding the project risks. All projects have some risk, and the
more unique a project is, the more risk may be present. It is impossible to remove all
sources of risk. It is undesirable to even try to remove all risk because that means the
organization is not trying anything new. A risk is anything that may impact the project
team’s ability to achieve the general project success measures and the specific project
stakeholder priorities. This impact can be something that poses a threat or “a risk that
would have a negative effect on one or more project objectives.”3 The impact, on the
other hand, could be something that poses an opportunity or “a risk that would have a
positive effect on one or more project objectives.”4
Wise project managers strive to develop a risk management plan, which is
“a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management
activities will be structured and performed,”5 and have it in place before risk events
occur. By documenting risk information in a proactive manner, a project manager
can eliminate or reduce the impact of some threats and capitalize on some opportu-
nities. The risk management plan is also useful for communicating with the various
project stakeholders and for later analysis to determine what worked well and may
be good practice to use on future projects, and what went poorly and should be
avoided on future projects.
Some risk management plans include all of the topics in this chapter. Others are
smaller. For example, a risk management plan template for an IT consulting company
is shown in Exhibit 10.3.

Chapter 10 Project Risk Planning
271

10-1a Roles and Responsibilities
It is good practice to encourage wide participation in risk management activities. One
reason is that everyone has a different perspective. The more perspectives that are con-
sidered, the more likely important risks will be uncovered early. Another good reason is
that people often resist when they are told what to do, but work with great enthusiasm if
they participated in the planning. The surest way to get the various project stakeholders
to buy into a risk management approach is to involve them right from the beginning in
risk management planning. Potential critics can be turned into allies if their concerns are
included.
The risk management plan should define who has responsibility for each risk man-
agement activity. On small projects, this is often the project manager or a core team
member for most activities. On larger projects, the plan can be more elaborate, with sub-
ject matter experts involved at many points.
10-1b Categories and Definitions
Most projects have many types of possible risks. Therefore, it is helpful to look at risks in
a systematic manner so as to consider as many types of risks as possible. One way to
look at risk is by considering when it occurs in the project life cycle. For example:
•
Certain types of risks, such as a customer not agreeing on the price, may occur
during project initiation.
•
Others, such as not finding a capable supplier, may occur during project planning.
•
Risks such as delivery difficulties from a supplier may occur during project
execution.
•
Risks such as the project deliverable not actually working properly may even appear
near the project conclusion.
The number and costs of project risks over a project life cycle are graphed in
Exhibit 10.4. More project risks are typically uncovered early in the life of a project.
However, the cost per risk discovered early is often less since there is time to make
changes in plans. Risks discovered late in a project can be very expensive. Experienced
project managers work hard to uncover risks as early in the project as feasible. Usually,
some risks are uncovered during project chartering. On small, simple projects this may
be the biggest risk identification push, but on other projects, a great deal of time and
effort may also be expended during project planning.
In addition to being categorized by when they might occur in a project, risks can also
be categorized by what project objective they may impact, such as cost, schedule, scope,
and/or quality. Risks can also be classified as external to the performing organization and
EXHIBIT 10.3
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN GUIDANCE FOR AN IT CONSULTING COMPANY
Risk management includes guidance on how to perform three risk management activities:
1.
Decide what level of risk premium to charge for the project. The team must rate factors such as project size, complexity,
technology, and type. The combined ratings dictate that a risk premium of 0, 10, or 20 percent be added to the
estimated project cost or, for very risky projects, that executive approval is mandated.
2.
Mitigate risk external to the firm through contract clauses and risk internal to the firm through agreements.
3.
Manage the risk very carefully through specifically designed weekly conference call meetings and reports.

internal to it; or by operational and strategic. Many organizations have developed lists of
risks for certain types of projects they routinely perform. Additionally, many writers have
created general lists of risk factors for certain types of projects. For example, Exhibit 10.5
shows the biggest fourteen risks on the Panama Canal expansion (which might be simi-
lar on other major construction projects), Exhibit 10.6 shows major risk categories
for international projects generally, and Exhibit 10.7 shows common risks for informa-
tion systems projects. Any of these categorizations can be shown as a risk breakdown
structure—“a hierarchical representation of risks according to their categories.”6

Yet another method of classifying project risk is by what is known about each. Something
that is a “known known” can be planned and managed with certainty. Therefore, it is not a
risk. An example is that cement will harden. The next level is “known unknowns,” which are
risks that can be identified and may or may not happen. These risks should be identified, and
a contingency reserve needs to be established to pay for them. An example on a long
construction project is that bad weather will probably happen at some points, but no one

knows exactly when or how bad it will be. The final level is for the true uncertainties. These
are called “unknown unknowns” (or “unk unks” by people who must deal with them).
Since they cannot even be envisioned, it is hard to know how much reserve time and money
is needed to cover them. They are usually covered by a management reserve, and the amount
of this reserve is often negotiated based upon the confidence level the project manager and
key stakeholders have regarding how well they understand the project. An example could be
a 100-year flood that covers a construction site that everyone thought was on high enough
ground to stay dry—an event so rare it is expected to happen only once a century.
10-2 Identify Risks
Once the risk management planning is in place, it is time to begin identifying specific
risks. Identify risks is “the process of determining which risks might affect the project
and documenting their characteristics.”7 Project managers are ultimately responsible for
identifying all risks, but often they rely upon subject matter experts to take a lead in
identifying certain technical risks.
10-2a Information Gathering
A large part of the risk identification process is gathering information. The categories
shown in Exhibits 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7 and/or project stages can be a good starting point
in this information gathering. The project manager either needs to act as a facilitator or
get another person to serve as facilitator for information gathering. This is essentially a
brainstorming activity, during which time the question “what could go wrong?” is
repeatedly asked of everyone who is present. It is helpful to use Post-it Notes and write
one risk per note to prepare for further processing the risks during risk analysis.
Classic rules for brainstorming are used. For example, every idea is treated as a useful
idea. The risks will be assessed next. If one suggested risk does not prove to be impor-
tant, it does not hurt to keep it on the list. Also, sometimes a risk that is obviously not
important—or is even humorous—may cause another person to think of an additional
risk they would not have considered otherwise.
While it is helpful to have as many stakeholders together as possible to “piggy-back” on
each other’s ideas, with the information technology available today, much of the same inter-
action can be achieved by global and virtual teams. It just takes a bit more careful planning.
Variations and extensions of possible risks can help a team to identify additional risks.
Several other techniques are also used in risk identification. Sometimes, team members
interview stakeholders. Other times SWOT analysis is “analysis of strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats to a project”8 might be used. Remember, risks can be both threats
to overcome and opportunities to exploit. Yet another method of identifying risks is the
Delphi technique, which is “an information gathering technique used as a way to reach a
consensus of experts on a subject. … Responses are summarized and recirculated for further
comment.”9 Finally, a team can use a structured review to identify risks.
10-2b Reviews
A project manager and team can review a variety of project documents to uncover possible
risks. Exhibit 10.8 lists some of the documents a project manager may use and typical ques-
tions he or she would ask for each. Project teams can often identify risks from each type of
review shown. Balance must be given to the extent of the reviews and the amount of useful
information regarding risks expected to result. As with the brainstorming mentioned previ-
ously, it is better to identify many possible risks and later determine that some of them are
not major, rather than to not identify what does turn out to be a big risk.
Chapter 10 Project Risk Planning
275

10-2c Understanding Relationships
Project managers can also seek to identify risks by learning the cause-and-effect relation-
ships of risk events. One useful technique is a flow chart that shows how people, money,
data, or materials flow from one person or location to another. This is essentially what
the team does when it reviews the project schedule, provided it looks at the arrows that
show which activities must precede others.
A second method of understanding risk relationships is to ask why a certain risk
event may happen. This can be accomplished through root cause analysis, which is “an
analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying reason that causes a variance
or defect or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance or defect or risk.”10
A simple approach to root cause analysis is to simply consider each risk one at a time
and ask, “Why might this happen?” At this point, since many potential risks have prob-
ably been identified, project teams do not spend a large amount of time on any single
risk. If necessary, the project team can perform more detailed root cause analysis of the
few risks that have been designated as major risks during risk analysis.
One more type of relationship project managers like to understand is trigger condi-
tions, or “an event or situation that indicates a risk is about to occur.”11 A trigger can be
specific to an individual risk, such as when a key supplier stops returning phone calls,
which may jeopardize their delivery of materials.
10-2d Risk Register
The primary output of risk identification is the risk register. When complete, the risk
register is “a document in which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are
recorded.”12 At this point (the end of risk identification), the risk register includes only the
risk categories, identified risks, potential causes, and potential responses. The other items
are developed during the remainder of risk planning. An example of a partial risk register
is shown in Exhibit 10.9.
The risk register is a living document. As a risk is identified, it is added. More infor-
mation regarding a risk can be added as it is discovered. As risks are handled, they can

be removed because they are no longer of the same level of concern. On smaller projects,
a spreadsheet works fine for a risk register. On larger, more complex projects, some
organizations use databases.
10-3 Risk Analysis
If a project team is serious about risk identification, they will uncover quite a few risks.
Next, the team needs to decide which risks are major and need to be managed carefully,
as opposed to those minor risks that can be handled more casually. The project team
should determine how well they understand each risk and whether they have the neces-
sary reliable data. Ultimately, they must be able to report the major risks to decision
makers.
10-3a Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
Perform qualitative risk analysis is “the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis
or action by assessing and combining their probability and impact.”13 All project teams
should perform this task. If they understand enough about the risks at this point, they
proceed directly to risk response planning for the major risks. If not, they use more
quantitative techniques to help them understand the risks better.
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN MAJOR AND MINOR RISKS The primary questions
project teams use in qualitative risk analysis are “how likely is this risk to happen?” and “if
it does happen, how big will the impact be?” This was shown in Exhibit 4.8 (see page 96).
A somewhat more involved example is shown in Exhibit 10.9. Note that for each
dimension—probability and impact—in Exhibit 10.10 a scale of 1 to 5 is used with
descriptions. The scale does not matter as long as it is applied
consistently and is easy for everyone to understand. Note also
the dark line. This line separates the major and catastrophic
risks that need either further analysis and/or specific contin-
gency plans from minor and moderate risks that can just be
listed and informally monitored. Without making a distinction
like this, project teams may be tempted to either ignore all risks
or to make contingency plans for all risks. Ignoring all risks al-
most guarantees the project has problems. Making contingency
plans for even minor risks is a terrible waste of time and draws
focus away from the really big risks.
Project teams sometimes also ask, for each risk, when is it
likely to occur in the project. This can be useful because those
risks that are likely to occur earlier often need to be assigned a
higher priority. Teams also sometimes ask how easy it is to
notice and correctly interpret the trigger condition. Risks
with triggers that are difficult to notice or interpret often are
assigned a higher priority.
CAUSE-AND-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS One additional
type of qualitative risk analysis is to determine cause-
and-effect relationships. This is part of root cause analysis,
which was described in the previous section on understanding
relationships. While effects are often more visible, it is often
easier to change the effect by changing the underlying cause.
For example, assume that a construction worker is not laying

stones evenly for a patio (the effect); perhaps the easiest way to ensure that future stones
are placed evenly is to understand why the worker is having problems. The cause may
turn out to be inconsistent stone size, incorrectly prepared ground, the cement for hold-
ing the stones having bigger gravel than normal, or an improperly functioning level. Once
the causes are understood, they can serve as trigger conditions to identify that a risk event
may be about to happen. This knowledge is useful when developing responses to risks.
CAUSE-AND-EFFECT DIAGRAM A tool that is useful in this analysis is the cause-
and-effect diagram. Many project teams use this diagram to identify possible causes for
a risk event. An example is shown in Exhibit 10.11.
The cause-and-effect diagram is also known as the fishbone diagram because the many
lines make it look like the skeleton of a dead fish. To construct the cause-and-effect diagram,
the project team first lists the risk as the effect in a box at the head of the fish. In this example, it
is late delivery. The more specifically the risk is stated, the more likely the team can uncover its

real causes. The next step is to name the big bones. In this case, there are four big bones named
people, machines, methods, and materials. There can be any number of big bones, and they can
be named whatever makes sense to the team constructing the diagram. Team members are
then encouraged to keep asking the question “why?” For example, why could people be a
cause? Because they are not trained properly or because they are overallocated are the two rea-
sons shown. Often, a team proposes many possible reasons. The team continues to break down
the reasons—that is, asking why until it no longer makes sense to ask why. Cause-and-effect
diagrams are frequently much fuller than this small example, with dozens of potential causes.
Once the team can no longer think of possible causes, they need to determine which of the
many possible causes are true causes. This can be accomplished by first selecting a few likely
causes and then testing them.
10-3b Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
Perform quantitative risk analysis is “the process of numerically analyzing the effect of
identified risks on overall project objectives.”14 While all projects use qualitative risk
analysis, quantitative risk analysis is only used when necessary. Bigger, more complex,
riskier, and more expensive projects often can benefit from the additional rigor of these
more structured techniques. Quantitative risk analysis is often used when being able to
predict with confidence what the probability is of completing a project on time, on bud-
get, and with the agreed upon scope and/or the agreed upon quality is critical. Some of
the more frequently used quantitative techniques are:
•
Decision tree analysis: “a diagramming and calculation technique for evaluating the
implications of a chain of multiple options in the presence of uncertainty.”15
•
Expected monetary value (EVA) analysis: “a statistical technique that calculates the
average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen.
A common use of this technique is within decision tree analysis.”16
•
Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA): “an analytical procedure in which each
potential failure mode in every component is analyzed to determine its effect on
reliability … and for all ways a failure may occur. For each potential failure, an
estimate is made on its effect on the total system.”17
•
Sensitivity analysis: “a quantitative risk analysis and modeling technique used to
help determine which risks have the most powerful impact on the project. It exam-
ines the extent to which the uncertainty in each project element affects the
objective. … The typical display is in the form of a tornado diagram.”18
•
Simulation: a technique that “uses a project model that translates the uncertainties spec-
ified as a detailed level into their potential impact on objectives. …Usually uses probability
distributions of possible costs or durations …and typically use Monte Carlo analysis.”19
Criteria to help select a suitable quantitative risk technique include the following:
•
The methodology should utilize the explicit knowledge of the project team
members.
•
The methodology should allow quick response.
•
The methodology should help determine project cost and schedule contingency.
•
The methodology should help foster clear communication.
•
The methodology should be easy to use and understand.20
10-3c Risk Register Updates
The probability of each risk occurring and the impact if it does happen are added to the
register for each risk. The priority for each risk is also listed. Some organizations use a
“Top 10” list to call particular attention to the highest priority risks. In addition, some
280
Part 2 Planning Projects

organizations choose to place higher priority on risks that are likely to happen soon.
Some organizations want to call attention to risks that are difficult to detect—that
is, risks with obscure trigger conditions. Any of these means of calling attention to cer-
tain risks are also listed in the risk register. If the project team performed any quantita-
tive risk analysis, the results are also documented in the risk register.
10-4 Plan Risk Responses
Once risks have been identified and analyzed, the project team decides how they will handle
each risk. Plan risk responses is “the process of developing options and actions to enhance
opportunities and reduce threats to project objectives.”21 This is often a creative time for proj-
ect teams as they decide how they will respond to each major risk. Sometimes a team develops
multiple strategies for a single risk because they do not believe one strategy will reduce the
threat or exploit the opportunity as much as the stakeholders would like. The team may decide
that it is not worth the effort to completely eliminate a threat. In those cases, the goal is to
reduce the threat to a level that the sponsor and other stakeholders deem acceptable.
10-4a Strategies for Responding to Risks
Because so many possible strategies can be developed for dealing with project risks, it
helps to classify the strategies. Common risk strategies are shown in Exhibit 10.12.

Chapter 10 Project Risk Planning
281

AVOID RISK Many people prefer to avoid a risk if possible, and sometimes that is the best
strategy. Sometimes, a project plan can be altered to avoid a risk by deleting the risky section.
For example, if the organizers of a parade are told by the local police that traffic patterns on
one section of their route are very difficult to control, perhaps they may alter the route. Project
risk response strategy decisions often must be made with a thorough understanding of the
priorities key stakeholders have of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. In this example, if no
powerful stakeholder had a strong interest in the exact route, the change might be easily
made. However, project managers need to understand that every decision they make regard-
ing risk response strategies may impact something else. Another avoidance strategy is to
ensure communications are good, especially concerning risky issues. Many risks can be more
easily addressed with prompt and accurate information. The ultimate avoidance strategy is to
not perform the project at all. This choice is sometimes made when the risks posed by the
project are deemed unacceptably large given the potential benefits. Before a decision is made
not to perform a project at all, normally each of the other strategies is considered.
TRANSFER RISK Sometimes, a decision is made to transfer some or all of a project risk to
another organization. One common means to do so is through insurance. Project insurance
works like any other type of insurance: a premium is paid so another organization will
assume a level of risk. Higher premiums need to be paid for more risk to be assumed
(think of lower deductibles). Therefore, using insurance as a risk transfer strategy is a two-
part decision: Do we transfer risk, and, if so, how much risk do we transfer? The answer
generally is “enough so the overall risk is acceptable to key stakeholders.”
A second transfer strategy deals with the type of contract used. An owner wishing
to transfer risk to a developer will want to use a fixed-price contract. The developer
who accepts the risk would insist on a higher price to cover her uncertainty. A devel-
oper who wishes to transfer risk to an owner would prefer a cost-plus contract under
which she is compensated for her cost plus a certain amount of profit. The owner,
in turn, would prefer to drive for a low cost in such an arrangement because he is
assuming the risk. Other types of contracts can be written so that both parties share
the project risk.
A third risk transfer strategy is to hire an expert to perform in the area of the risk and
to hold that person accountable. None of the transfer strategies eliminate risk; they just
force someone else to assume it.
MITIGATE RISK Mitigation strategies are those in which an effort is made to lower risk.
In general, this means either reducing the probability of a risk event happening and/or
reducing the impact if it does happen. For example, a major risk could be that a key
resource may not be available. To reduce the probability of that happening, perhaps the
person could be hired well in advance of the project and protected from work on com-
peting projects. To reduce the impact if this person was not available after all, perhaps
the project team would like to use the second mitigation strategy and build in redun-
dancy. They could train another team member to do the work of the key resource.
Redundancy is a way of life in systems projects such as developing an aircraft. However,
the simple answer is not to continue to build in more and more redundancy, because the
aircraft would eventually become so heavy it could not fly and so expensive no one could
afford it. Therefore, a third mitigation strategy is often utilized: Use more reliable meth-
ods. If the primary way of performing a key activity is highly reliable, there is less need
for other mitigation strategies.
ACCEPT RISK A fourth risk response strategy is to accept the risk. This is often used for the
risks deemed to be minor. The project team deals with them if and when they happen. If the
risks deemed to be minor really are, most of them will not happen, and when they do, most
282
Part 2 Planning Projects

will not cause major disruptions. However, some risks a team chooses to accept can have an
unfortunate impact on the project if left untended. Therefore, project teams often define a trig-
ger condition for one of these accepted risks. The trigger condition marks the dividing point
where, instead of just watching for the risk, the team starts to deal with it. For fruit and vegetable
growers in California, the trigger condition may be a weather report predicting cold tempera-
tures. Armed with that knowledge, the growers enact strategies to protect their crops to the ex-
tent possible and cost effective. The growers are willing to accept the risk of cold weather once
in a while because they make enough money at other times to compensate. If they were in a
climate with more cold weather, they may choose not to grow sensitive crops during the cold
season. One other acceptance strategy is to put contingencies of time and/or money into the
project plan to cover the risks that transpire. Each of these acceptance strategies can also be
used to take advantage of opportunities. Establishing trigger conditions to notify the team
when an opportunity is present, dealing with it as it happens, and having a little extra time
and money to alter the project plans to reap the potential benefits all make sense. An example
could be when a company develops a new style of hat, a celebrity wears it on TV, and the de-
mand then takes off. By using more money to advertise to the unexpected audience, the com-
pany may generate many additional sales.
RESEARCH RISK The best way to handle a risk may sometimes be to learn more about it.
The first research strategy, therefore, is to secure better and/or more information so the proj-
ect team understands what they are dealing with. Projects often are conducted in a rapidly
changing environment in which decisions need to be made quickly, often based upon imper-
fect and incomplete information. It is unusual to be able to gather and verify all the informa-
tion desired; however, sometimes it is useful to improve the information available. Another
research strategy is to verify assumptions that have been made. Assumptions that prove to be
false become risks. Yet another research strategy is to perform the project on a small scale
first to see if it works. This can include constructing a prototype, test marketing a new prod-
uct, running new software in one department first, and so on. Project teams can often learn a
great deal from trying their ideas on a small scale first. These research strategies work well for
both reducing threats and capitalizing on opportunities.
EXPLOIT OPPORTUNITY One strategy that is aimed exclusively at opportunities is
exploitation. A project manager may identify trigger conditions that, if reached, will allow
her to go to her sponsor to request that the project become a higher priority. If the organiza-
tion wants to exploit opportunities, they can assign more or better resources to the project,
remove barriers, and give it more visibility in management reviews.
SHARE OPPORTUNITY One additional exploitation strategy deals with the results of
the project. Perhaps the project team is able to develop a new product or service so rev-
olutionary that the parent organization is not capable of fully exploiting it. In a case like
this, the parent organization may spin off a nimble subsidiary, form a joint venture with
another firm, or sell the rights to the product.
ENHANCE OPPORTUNITY Essentially, a project team wants to either maximize the prob-
ability that an opportunity will occur and/or maximize the impact if it does. The project man-
ager wants to identify key drivers of these positive impacts and develop strategies to capitalize
upon them. Certainly, adding more or better resources is one way of enhancing opportunities.
10-4b Risk Register Updates
The project manager sees that the risk register is updated with the results of the response
planning. For each risk, this means the response strategy is noted. It also means that a
single person is assigned as the “owner” of each risk. That person is responsible for
Chapter 10 Project Risk Planning
283

understanding the trigger and for implementing the strategy. Finally, any changes that
need to be made to the project schedule, budget, resource assignments, and communica-
tions plan should be included.
Summary
All projects have some risks. More unique projects
have more unknowns and, therefore, more risks.
A project manager needs to use an appropriate level
of detail in risk planning—enough to plan for major
risks, yet not so much that a great deal of time is spent
on minor risks.
Risk management planning starts with understand-
ing what constitutes success for the upcoming project.
This may require understanding the tradeoff decisions
that key stakeholders are willing to make. Risk manage-
ment planning is part of the overall project manage-
ment plan and may be performed concurrently with
other project planning.
Identifying risks includes gathering information on
potential risks. This can be accomplished by having the
project core team and selected subject matter experts
brainstorm all of the possible risks. Many times, a
core team can review documents such as the project
charter, communication plan, or schedule to help iden-
tify risks. The core team can look outside project
documentation for reviews of literature by peers.
Once risks have been identified, the core team creates
the risk register with each risk categorized. Sometimes,
a team also lists potential causes for each risk and po-
tential responses at this time.
The next major activity is to analyze the risks. At
a minimum, this involves determining which risks
are major—at least from the standpoints of how
likely each risk event is and how big of an impact
it will have if it happens. Sometimes, more sophis-
ticated analysis is performed to identify the root
causes of risks, to identify the trigger conditions
that signify the risk event is about to happen, or
to
consider
more
complex
relationships
among
risks. Quantitative techniques are sometimes used
to determine which risks are major.
Risk response planning involves determining in
advance how to respond to each major risk. Minor risks
are handled by simply being aware of their potential and
dealing with them if and when they occur. Eight types of
risk response strategies that can be applied to major risks
are avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept, research, exploit,
share, and enhance. A project manager may decide to
use multiple strategies on a large and critical risk. Armed
with proper risk planning, a project manager is confident
to begin even a risky project.

Risk Management on a Satellite Development Project
Introduction
Proactive risk management is definitely one of the key
advantages in implementing and using standardized
project management practices today. We always have
the balancing act of managing the triple constraint of
cost, time, and scope, and on top of that, we need to
effectively assure project quality and that we have
enough resources to do the job. In this age, we are
continuously asked to optimize our performance and
“be more efficient”; often, this is because we simply
have too much work and not enough people to do it.
So, in practice, we work with risks every day—from the
risk of not spending enough time planning to the risk of
not having enough supplies, or even the risk of not
running a thorough enough risk management program.
Some time ago, I worked on a satellite development
project that involved a lot of research technologies.
There were many unknowns, with variables in the
manufacture of components, integration of systems,
working with subcontractors, tests, and other areas that
made the project full of risk. Additionally, we were on a
tight timeline for production and had only limited
budget reserves available to handle cost overruns.
Thus, we needed a practical way to manage and deal
with the risks of the project. By systematically working
with the risks of the project, we were better able to
prepare responses to the risks if and when they
occurred.
Planning
For our project, it was essential to have an integrated
system and mechanism for risk management. Thus, at
the outset of the project, during the planning phase, we
developed our risk management plan and established
with the team the process for dealing with not only risk
but also any subsequent changes that could occur with
the project as a result of the risk. This was done during
a day-long clinic where we exclusively worked on
developing this risk plan, as we knew our project was
high risk and we wanted to make sure we could work
with the plan. We developed criteria for evaluating
probabilities of occurrence and impact for the risk and
also for prioritizing risks. Furthermore, we researched
and compared our methods to industry standards for
risk management such as those from SEI®.22
Execution
Once we had a solid approach for risk management in
this project, we then went forward with the processes
of identifying our project risks, analyzing the risks,
developing potential responses for the risks, and
deciding upon next steps for the risks. Our approach to
all this was an integrated one, using a risk
management database tool we developed as its
cornerstone. This tool allowed for anyone in the project
team to view the risks, enter new risks, and provide
input for potential risk responses. An example of a
similar type of tool is shown in Exhibit 10.14, where
each risk is logged as a record in the database. The
database allowed the team to have a single repository
for recording and logging all the risks for the project,
which was critically important because the risks in
satellite development were constantly changing.
Every other month, the project team would hold a
risk management review, in which each risk would be
discussed and any decisions on actions would be
made. Typically, we would meet and review the risks
logged in the database in this group setting, and the
risk’s assigned owner would talk about the background
of the risk, things that occurred since the risk was first
logged (or since the last risk review), and what he or
she felt the next steps needed to be. Project team
members brought up other areas of the project that
might have been impacted by the risk or new risks that
resulted from the occurrence of the risk, or provided
potential ideas for deferring, transferring, mitigating, or
accepting the risk. The team also determined whether
the risk decision needed to be elevated.
Another reason we held risk management reviews
was to make sure that the team was up to date with the
overall project’s risks. Based on the criteria we defined
in developing the risk management plan, the database
tool provided us a prioritized report of all the project’s
risks. That risk report was used by the group to make
decisions about the project and look at mitigation
strategies for the project as a whole. The risk
management review provided us with an avenue
through which we could work together to resolve the
high-priority risks of the project. Often, the high-priority
risks were related to overall project drivers, and it was
essential to be as proactive as possible in managing
288

those risks. Moreover, by examining and analyzing the
project risks in this manner, potential risks for other
related projects, in this case other satellite
development projects, were also identified.
The level of risk management necessary for a project
can vary greatly. On the satellite development project, it
was necessary to have a comprehensive program to
address risk because there were many unknowns. We
performed all our duties with the notion of understanding
risk, and thus the risk management program addressed
both the daily needs of logging and updating risks and the
long-term strategic needs of understanding risk
implications. However, for a smaller or more well-defined
project, having such a detailed level of risk management
may be unwieldy and difficult to manage. The key is
finding the appropriate level for the project at hand.

Fortune 500 customers include Lockheed Martin, General Electric, General
Dynamics, Raytheon, Boeing, and others.
Performing to the exacting standards of such a demanding clientele is a

subcontractors from the bid and proposal process. For example, most major
manufacturers of flight safety hardware are required to adhere to AS 9100c,
which incorporates the well-known ISO 9001:2000 quality management
system standards. Through various clauses, AS 9100c requires manufactures
to connect the dots between project, quality, and risk management systems
through a single, auditable system. While a detailed description of the AS

9100c requirements are beyond the scope of this chapter, suffice it to say
they’re extremely challenging to industry newcomers and offer a competitive
advantage to companies like GTC who are able to meet them. In short, for
GTC, proper quality planning is more than good project management—it is a
matter of survival!
Quality and Risk
As if manufacturing highly complex, tight-tolerance aerospace and defense
hardware is not challenging enough, the majority of related contracts trans-
fer the risk to the subcontractor through firm-fixed-price arrangements.
Under such arrangements, the subcontractor agrees to manufacture hard-
ware at an agreed upon fixed price, assuming all risks associated with
schedule
and
cost
overruns
(unless
otherwise
specified
through
an
approved change order process).
In such an environment, it is imperative for the subcontractor to under-
stand all quality and technical performance requirements prior to beginning
the manufacturing process. Failing to do so can erode profit margins, dam-
age customer relationships, and negatively impact the performance of
highly engineered projects.
Further, quality and technical performance requirements are typically
required to be imposed upon the subcontractor’s supply chain via the
“flow-down” process. This commonly occurs when processes are outside
of GTC’s core capabilities, yet are required to complete the manufacturing
process. Proper quality planning is essential to ensure that all provided ser-
vices adhere to the stringent standards of the source documents (Purchase
Order, Statement of Work, technical publications, etc.). Within GTC’s quality
planning system, vendor selection requires special investigation to ensure
the following criteria can be met:
•
The vendor is on the GTC “Approved Vendor” list.
•
When required, the vendor is on the customer’s “Approved Vendor” list
(this is typically referred to as a “Yellow Pages”–approved supplier).
•
The vendor is capable of providing the service in the required time
frame and has available capacity to meet the demand.
•
The vendor can meet all the procedural requirements and provide the
required certifications for traceability and part pedigree.

Failing to “flow-down” all quality requirements at the start of a project
can create significant, if not irreversible, challenges to part delivery. This
makes the quality planning process especially important to companies oper-
ating within firm-fixed-price environments, like GTC.
Few knowledge areas are more important than project quality manage-
ment; and this is especially true where the safety of aviation and defense
personnel are involved.
Perhaps the best way to understand the contemporary approach to project
management is to learn how the contemporary approach to project quality
management
developed.
Many
people
have
influenced
the
modern
approaches to quality, and their contributions have largely been meshed
together to give project managers a full understanding of project quality
demands, processes, and tools. With this understanding, project managers
are ready to perform project quality management—all the necessary work to
ensure that project deliverables satisfy their intended purpose. This chapter
includes the first part of project quality management, namely plan quality
management, which is “the process of identifying quality requirements and/
or standards for the project and its deliverables, and documenting how the
project will demonstrate compliance.”1 The remaining parts of quality
management are covered in Chapter 14.
This is the final chapter dealing with project planning. Quality planning is
often performed simultaneously with other aspects of project planning. Once
the various aspects of planning are complete, the project manager leads the
team in sorting out any inconsistencies. The team then takes the completed
project plan to the sponsor and other stakeholders for approval. Once the
plan is accepted, it is communicated widely, and the project execution
formally begins. Completing and approving the overall project management
plan in this manner demonstrates how contemporary project management is
integrative, iterative, and collaborative.
On agile projects, quality is planned at a high level for the entire project at
the outset and at a detailed level just before the start of each iteration.
11-1 Development of Contemporary Quality Concepts
The contemporary approach to quality management has evolved first from the teachings
of several quality “gurus” from the 1950s through the 1980s and then through various
frameworks popularized during the last 25 years.
11-1a Quality Gurus
Arguably the most influential thought leader in quality was W. Edwards Deming. One
concise way to summarize his ideas is his four-part Profound Knowledge System, shown
in Exhibit 11.1. Deming started as a statistician, and initially preached that understand-
ing variation was essential to improving quality. By the time he had fully developed this
system, he also stated that it is important to understand how companies operate as
systems; that managers need insight in order to accurately predict the future; and that
leaders need to understand individual motivations.
Joseph Juran, who was a contemporary of Deming, also wrote and lectured prolifically
for decades. Juran is perhaps best known for his Quality Trilogy of quality planning,
A G I L E

Part 2 Planning Projects

quality control, and quality improvement, as shown in Exhibit 11.2. The PMBOK® Guide
coverage of quality largely mirrors Juran’s approach.
Many other pioneers in quality, particularly Japanese and American, have added to
the body of quality concepts and tools. Several of the most influential, and their contri-
butions that apply specifically to project quality, are shown in Exhibit 11.3.
Much of the work of these pioneers and many others has been incorporated into
three popular frameworks that many organizations use to define and organize their qual-
ity initiatives. These frameworks are Total Quality Management (TQM), the Interna-
tional Organization for Standardization (ISO), and Six Sigma.
11-1b Total Quality Management/Malcolm Baldrige
TQM came into vogue during the late 1980s when it was becoming more widely apparent
that the old way of trying to catch quality problems by inspection was not adequate. Many
early advocates of TQM used slightly different ways of describing it. What they had in
common was implied by the first word in the name: total. Most serious practitioners
included several components in their TQM system. In the United States, government,
business, consulting, and academic specialists in quality worked together to develop a
common means of describing TQM. This description forms the key areas of the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award as shown in Exhibit 11.4.
11-1c ISO 9001:2008
While the Baldrige Award is a framework developed in the United States, ISO represents
a framework developed in Europe. The International Organization for Standardization
has developed many technical standards since 1947. ISO 9001 is the quality management

DEMING’S PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM
Systems
Interactions occur among parts of a system, and parts cannot be managed in isolation.
Variation
Managers need to understand common and special causes of variation and then work to reduce both.
Knowledge
Managers need to learn from the past and understand cause-and-effect relationships to predict future behavior.
Psychology
Leaders need to understand what motivates each individual and how different people and groups interact.

standard, and the 2008 designation is the latest revision of the standard. When the
standards first appeared, they focused largely on documenting work processes. However,
over the years the standards have evolved, and the current five quality management areas
with specific requirements are shown in Exhibit 11.5. Notice that they contain many of
the same ideas as the current Baldrige Award key areas and specific responsibilities.
11-1d Lean Six Sigma
Lean evolved from lean manufacturing ideas of eliminating as much waste as possible
from work processes. Sigma stands for standard deviation—a statistical term for the
amount of variation in data. Six Sigma quality literally means quality problems are mea-
sured in parts per million opportunities. Many projects have few routine activities
and many unusual activities, so the rigor of the statistics in Six Sigma is not always
applicable. However, the ideas behind Six Sigma provide a meaningful framework for
project quality. As of this writing, Six Sigma is a popular approach to quality as Motor-
ola, General Electric, and many other companies have promoted its usage. General Elec-
tric in particular expanded the focus of Six Sigma to include many service processes that
people had previously said were too difficult to measure.
Six Sigma uses a disciplined process called the define, measure, analyze, improve, and
control (DMAIC) process to plan and manage improvement projects. The DMAIC
methodology is a 15-step process broken up into five project phases: define, measure,
analyze, improve, and control, as shown in Exhibit 11.6. The DMAIC process is illus-
trated to show objectives within each of the five key stages. It is shown as a continuous,
circular flow because DMAIC is typically used as a method of implementing continuous
improvement and thus can be practiced repeatedly. Lean Six Sigma uses DMAIC and
waste elimination together to improve performance.

11-2 Core Project Quality Concepts
Each of the quality gurus and frameworks provides input into the contemporary under-
standing of project quality. As stated in Chapter 1, A Guide to the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) uses a simple definition of project quality: “the
degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements.”2 However, to fully
understand both the meaning of this definition and how to achieve it, one needs to
understand the four contemporary core project quality concepts that have evolved from
the sources above. The four core project quality concepts are:
1. Stakeholder satisfaction
2. Process management
3. Fact-based management
4. Empowered performance
11-2a Stakeholder Satisfaction
Stakeholder satisfaction consists of identifying all stakeholders, using a structured process
to determine relevant quality standards, and understanding the stakeholders’ ultimate
quality goals. External stakeholders may include customers, suppliers, the public, and
other groups. Internal stakeholders may include shareholders and workers at all levels
and all functions within the organization.

3. Understand the prioritized stakeholders’ requirements.
4. Develop standards to ensure the requirements are met.
5. Make tradeoff decisions.
Stakeholders actively participate in the process of developing quality standards. There-
fore, they make judgments about the quality of a process based on what they see. Thus,
stakeholders judge the quality both of project work processes and of deliverables. When
making tradeoff decisions, the project manager often facilitates the process, and the
stakeholders actually make the decisions. Stakeholders frequently need to be reminded
that the relative importance of cost, schedule, scope, and quality can be very helpful in
determining sensible standards.
STAKEHOLDER SATISFACTION SAYINGS When satisfying stakeholders, it is helpful
to remember a few sayings. One is the old carpenters’ advice of “measure twice, cut
once.” This careful planning tends to yield less variation, less cost, and faster delivery—all
of which satisfy stakeholders. Another saying is “meet requirements, but exceed
expectations.” Contractually, a project must meet the agreed upon specifications, but if
stakeholders see excellent work processes and experience clear communications, their
expectations will be exceeded, and they will be even happier. This point regarding meeting
requirements while exceeding expectations comes from two sources. Good project man-
agement practice is to meet requirements without spending extra money or time. Good
quality practice is to not only satisfy but also to delight customers. The third saying is
“a smart project manager develops capable customers.” That means the customer is able
to use the project deliverables to do his or her job better. This often results in opportunities
for additional revenue streams by partnering, training, and supporting the customer.
Advice given on agile projects is to communicate often (maybe daily) with the owner
and other stakeholders. This is good advice for any project.
11-2b Process Management
A process is “a systematic series of activities directed towards causing an end result such
that one or more inputs will be acted upon to create one or more outputs.”3 To effec-
tively manage project processes, project managers need to understand, control, and
improve them.
PROCESS UNDERSTANDING WITH A SIPOC MODEL The first part of understanding
a project is to demonstrate that all work flows from suppliers, through the project,
to customers. A useful way to envision this is a tool called a supplier-input-process-
output-customer (SIPOC) model, as shown in Exhibit 11.7.
In Exhibit 11.7, the process boundaries are clearly defined. This prevents future scope
creep from occurring by eliminating previous or later steps in the process. The SIPOC
above also begins to identify key stakeholders who both provide inputs into the process
(suppliers) and receive benefits from the process (customers) and shows feedback loops
that provide useful information.
One way to interpret the SIPOC is to think backward from the project’s customers.
As described previously in the stakeholder satisfaction section, it is helpful for a project
manager to identify all of the customers for his or her project and the outputs each
desires. Since that is usually a far-reaching list, prioritization decisions need to be made.
At that point, the project manager can work with the project core team to define the
work processes necessary to create those outputs. Then they can identify the inputs
they need in order to accomplish those activities and determine who will supply them.
Once the supplier-customer view is understood, it is time to determine whether the
process is capable of creating the project deliverables. This discussion should be initiated
A G I L E
Chapter 11 Project Quality Planning and Project Kickoff
297

when the project charter is developed. As people discuss the milestone schedule, risks,
and constraints, if there are serious doubts, they should be raised. On some small pro-
jects, that may be enough to determine if the proposed methods of creating the project
deliverables will work. On others, more detailed analysis of schedule, resources, and risks
may yield further insight. When considering if a project process is capable, the project
manager needs to understand the conditions in which the project may operate and
ensure that the methods can be flexible enough to handle various contingencies that
might develop.
Experienced project managers understand that it is far better to design quality into their
processes than to find problems only upon inspection. In the first place, it costs more to
make junk and then remake to obtain good outputs. Secondly, having to rework anything
aggravates time pressure that already exists on many projects. Finally, even the best inspectors
do not find every mistake, and some of the mistakes are likely to reach customers.
PROCESS CONTROL The second aspect of process management is process control.
Control is “comparing actual performance with planned performance, analyzing
variances, assessing trends to effect process improvements, evaluating possible alterna-
tives, and recommending appropriate corrective action as needed.”4 The purpose of
process control is to have confidence that outputs are predictable. Process control is cov-
ered in Chapter 14. If the outputs are not predictable—or if they are predictable but not
satisfactory—then a project manager needs to use the third aspect of process manage-
ment: process improvement.
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT WITH A PDCA MODEL Processes can be improved in
either a continuous or a breakthrough fashion. All project core team members and
subject matter experts (SMEs) should be thinking of little ways they can improve at any

time. Slow and steady improvement is a good foundation. However, sometimes substan-
tial improvement is necessary, and a breakthrough is in order. Regardless of the size of
improvement desired, many models exist to guide the effort. Improvement models such
as DMAIC are usually based upon the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) improvement cycle, as
displayed in Exhibit 11.8.
When project managers are considering process improvements, they often involve
suppliers and/or customers in a partnering arrangement. Often, they need to forecast
changes in their work environment, technology, or
customer desires. Organizations that take a balanced
view of long-term
improvement
and short-term
results
create
a
culture
where
project
process
improvement can thrive. Organizations that focus
almost exclusively on short-term results make it hard
for project managers to devote much energy to pro-
cess improvement.
11-2c Fact-Based Management
One challenge many project managers face is making
decisions based upon facts. Making decisions using
facts sounds like a sensible thing to do, yet it is diffi-
cult because:
•
Opinions get in the way.
•
It is hard to know what data need to be collected.
•
Projects often operate with so much time pressure that decisions need to be made
quickly.
Four aspects of fact-based management are understanding variation, deciding what
to
measure,
working correctly
with data,
and
using the resulting
information
appropriately.
EXHIBIT 11.8
PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT MODEL
Plan: Select needed
improvement, understand
process and reasons for
trouble, and create plan

small scale and collect data

results after the change
with those before to see if
there was an improvement
Act: If results are good enough,
implement the improvement,
otherwise try again

Even with good inspectors, some mistakes will reach customers if
poor quality exists in project processes.
Chapter 11 Project Quality Planning and Project Kickoff
299

UNDERSTANDING VARIATION Project decision makers need to understand the dif-
ference between two types of variation. A common cause is variation that is a result of
the product design and the method of making it and is exhibited by a random pattern
within predictable limits. On the other hand, a special cause is variation that comes from
external sources that are not inherent in the process and can be quite unpredictable. It is
important to determine when there is variation on a project whether it is within the
range of what can be expected for that particular work activity or deliverable (common
cause) or whether something unusual is happening (special cause). If the variation is due
to a common cause, but the results are still not acceptable, some change needs to be
made to the system—the way in which the work is accomplished. However, if the change
is due to a particular cause, then the way to improve is to change that particular cause
and not the entire system. Many quality proponents estimate that a large majority of var-
iation is due to common causes, yet many managers are quick to try to find a person or
issue to blame (special cause). The problem is often compounded when a cause is really
part of the system, yet individuals are blamed. The problem does not go away, and peo-
ple become fearful. Management by facts requires an understanding that variation can be
due to either common or special causes, a determination to discover which type, and the
resolve to act appropriately upon that discovery.
DETERMINING WHAT TO MEASURE A project manager wants to avoid the extreme of
not measuring anything since he or she is in a hurry and there is not enough time, and the
other extreme of measuring many things just to be sure. As project managers become more
experienced, they develop an understanding of how many data are useful to collect and when
they need to move into action regardless of the data they have. A quality metric is “a descrip-
tion of a project or product attribute and how to measure it.”5 Measures may include project
attributes such as on-time or on-budget performance or product attributes such as defect fre-
quency. If a good charter was created, a milestone schedule with acceptance criteria for each
milestone was developed. These can be useful measures. Project teams often can seek use-
ful measures when they study lessons learned from previous projects. Many lessons
either state what worked well and should be repeated on future projects or what
worked poorly and should be avoided on future projects. Both often provide ideas
for useful measures. The project manager and sponsor should agree on what mea-
sures will be taken, when they will be taken, and under what circumstances. While
many sponsors can be quite busy, the more specific this agreement becomes, the
more useful the data collected are likely to be.
WORKING CORRECTLY WITH DATA A third aspect of management by facts is how
the identified data are collected, handled, and stored. Data are simple representations of
facts that are collected using a measurement process.6 Generally, the person(s) closest to
the situation are best for collecting data. Efforts should be made to ensure that the data
are complete, without errors, and timely. Many project teams either use templates from
their organization or create their own forms for collecting data. When more than one
person is involved, efforts should be made to be consistent. Once the data are collected,
they should be analyzed. A great deal can be learned by using simple tools to look for
patterns and trends in data. On larger, more complex projects and sophisticated Six
Sigma projects, more detailed statistical analysis is often used. The analysis should turn
the raw data into information useful to decision makers.
USING THE RESULTING INFORMATION APPROPRIATELY The final aspect of mak-
ing fact-based decisions is how the information is used. Information is derived from data
and understood in the context of the project.7 Project communications plans often spell out
300
Part 2 Planning Projects

how the information is disseminated. The best project cultures encourage truth and transpar-
ency in communication—even when it is inconvenient. People are encouraged to use informa-
tion to challenge opinions and decisions. Making decisions based upon facts often requires
courage. It also requires judgment because challenges that are of a factual nature are helpful,
yet if the challenges become personal and are not fact based, they can be destructive.
11-2d Empowered Performance
The fourth and final core project quality concept is empowered performance. The goal of
empowered performance is to have capable and willing workers at every level and every
function within a company. Corporate leaders set the stage for this by developing the
organizational culture. Project sponsors and managers, in turn, develop the project cul-
ture. Remember from Chapter 3 that organizational culture includes the formal and in-
formal practices utilized, along with the values shared by members of an organization.
Part of an empowered performance culture is setting an expectation for managers to en-
courage their associates to take appropriate risks and to treat risk events as learning op-
portunities, not as a time to punish. Part of it is training and equipping workers so they
are willing to take risks. Part is getting managers to let go of some decision-making au-
thority so those lower in the organization can make some decisions. Yet another aspect
of empowered performance is helping to develop specialists who can aid anyone in the
organization. An example is a person trained as a Black Belt in a Six Sigma organization,
who becomes an expert in guiding process improvement projects.
RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALITY One essential understanding in creating capable and willing
workers is that everyone is an individual. Leaders at all levels can promote inclusiveness and
recognize that diversity is not only accepted, but also very helpful as projects develop.
CAPITALIZE ON INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS Outstanding project managers not only
want to recruit and develop a unique team, they also want to capitalize on each person’s un-
ique strengths. Each person has unique talents, and the best opportunity for each person to
improve and feel validated is to use their unique talents. When a person feels his boss under-
stands him and works to create opportunities for him to do both what he most wants to do
and what he has the potential to be best at, he achieves at the highest possible level.
EMPHASIZE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES Empowered performance requires that
people understand and accept their responsibilities. Much of the responsibility falls
upon the project manager and core team. However, SMEs are responsible for their indi-
vidual activities. Functional managers, who are the technical supervisors of the SMEs, are
responsible for the methods of work chosen. Sponsors share a high-level responsibility
for project completion with project managers. Customer representatives are responsible
for understanding the impact of directives they may give a project manager. Ultimately,
everyone must understand what they need to do, realize how it fits in the bigger picture,
and then commit to both completing their work correctly and accepting the conse-
quences of their decisions.
USE APPROPRIATE COLLABORATION Finally, appropriate collaboration is a key to
developing empowered performance. This is true both within and beyond the organiza-
tional boundaries. A great deal of project work is performed by cross-functional teams.
Cross-functional teams are most effective when individual, team, and organizational
learning flourishes. One effective method of encouraging this learning in projects is to
develop lessons learned at the completion of project milestones and at project closure.
These lessons then need to be shared openly with other project teams. Collaboration
Chapter 11 Project Quality Planning and Project Kickoff
301

and learning accelerate when people share outside of their parent organization. Of
course, some things cannot be shared, but a surprising number of things can be shared.
When the recipients of those lessons reciprocate, the first team learns. This type of exter-
nal sharing can be through conferences, company exchanges, or other means. An
example of a unique project challenge that needed empowered performance to be
successful is the vintage aircraft shipping project in Exhibit 11.9.
11-2e Summary of Core Concepts
A summary of project Quality core concepts is shown in Exhibit 11.10.
11-3 Plan Quality Management
The quality management plan is “a component of the project management plan that
describes how an organization’s quality policies will be implemented.”8 Therefore, a
logical place to start is by understanding what a quality policy is and how it governs
EXHIBIT 11.9
VINTAGE AIRCRAFT SHIPPING PROJECT
Global Shipping Company (GSC) was approached by an individual who was interested in selling and shipping an antique $1 mil-
lion 1942 Staggered-Wing Beech aircraft from Cincinnati to a buyer in Australia. Since the aircraft was fragile, a plan needed to
be developed for moving it as economically as possible while avoiding damage.
One challenge was handling the entire project in-house using only the company’s staff, equipment, and resources, and the
other was to devising a custom solution for moving this unusual piece of cargo.
GSC has an organizational culture that encourages cross-training, collaboration among departments, risk-taking, and designing
creative approaches to problem solving while minimizing cost. Because of the size and fragility of the aircraft, a strategy was
devised to dismantle it and ship via containerized ocean freight. The project was broken down into five distinct segments: pick
up, dismantling, packing, loading, and shipping.
To pick up the entire aircraft, the equipment, permits, and escorts had to be arranged to get the aircraft intact from the air-
port and move it to the warehouse down a major street on the back of a flatbed truck In order to fit in a standard ocean con-
tainer, the aircraft had to be dismantled—under the supervision of the FAA—and documented to meet FAA regulations.
To avoid damage, each piece had to be individually packaged. Different types of cloth and foam had to be tested and selected in
order to prevent scratching the aircraft. Due to the height restrictions, the warehouse personnel had to design and build a custom
gurney to allow the body of the plane to be
wheeled into the container and secured. Once
packaged, the individual pieces were then loaded,
blocked, and braced into the container to prevent
damage while in transit; then the aircraft was
shipped.
The
dismantling,
documentation,
and
packing process was designed in a way that the
new owner of the aircraft could replicate it in order
to move the plane for air shows and events.
The project’s success was achieved by having
the courage to take on the project in the first place,
the ability to use the company’s resources creatively
and efficiently, and the ability to adapt the plan
when unexpected events occurred. The result was a
project that was successfully completed, meeting all
FAA standards, exceeding stakeholder expectations,
and developing a shipping process that can be
replicated.

the actions of a project manager and team. The remainder of this section discusses the
components of a project quality management plan and process improvement plan.
11-3a Quality Policy
The top management of an organization normally writes a concise statement to guide
their company’s quality efforts. This policy reflects top management’s principles of
achieving quality and the benefits they hope to achieve with good quality. Project man-
agers normally first consider using the quality policy of their parent company—if it is a
good fit. If not, or if the project is a partnership between organizations, the project man-
ager may need to combine and/or supplement the quality policies. However, the project’s
quality policy should never violate the intent of the quality policies of either the parent
company or of a major customer.

Chapter 11 Project Quality Planning and Project Kickoff
303

A study of 25 corporate quality policies in 2013 using an Internet search found that
they vary widely. Some are less than 20 words, while others are over 200 words. The
content and style can be quite different. The frequency of terms that interest project
managers is shown in Exhibit 11.11.
Several interesting patterns can easily be found. First, virtually every policy includes a ref-
erence to customers. The vast majority state that customers are the reason for their existence.
Next, most quality policies also include improving processes. Many include satisfying
requirements, but very few include exceeding requirements. This means that, for most com-
panies, quality is measured by how well requirements are met, not exceeded. A large majority
of policies mention both products and services—a reminder to project managers that services
and information are frequently needed along with products to satisfy a customer’s needs.
A majority of firms explicitly include value to customers and/or cost control.
The next tier of responses includes the importance of employees, excellence, commit-
ment, meeting standards, and sustainability/reliability/dependability. The lowest tier lists
many other words that appeared in 10 to 20 percent of the policies. That does not mean
decision makers necessarily feel these terms are unimportant—just that they are not as
important as the ones explicitly mentioned. Remember, many of these policies are very
short and only include a few key thoughts. They are meant to set direction, not plan
detail.

11-3b Quality Management Plan Contents
In addition to the quality policy, most project quality management plans describe which
quality standards the project will use and how the project team will implement them.
The quality management plan may include a description of the quality baseline by which
the project will be judged, along with methods for quality assurance and control.
The quality management plan is a portion of the overall project management plan. On
many small, simple projects, the quality planning is performed concurrently with other plan-
ning, and the quality plan is seamlessly incorporated into the project plan. On some large,
complex, or unusual projects, the quality planning is handled separately, and the plan, while
a portion of the overall project plan, appears as an additional document.
A project quality management plan should describe how to identify some or all of the
following:
•
The project’s overall quality objectives
•
Key project deliverables and the standards to evaluate each
•
Deliverable completeness and correctness criteria from the customer’s viewpoint
•
Quality control activities
•
Critical project work processes and standards to review each
•
Stakeholder expectations for project processes
•
Quality assurance activities
•
Quality roles and responsibilities
•
Quality tools
•
Quality reporting plan9
On agile projects, a definition of done is explicitly stated. This includes acceptance
criteria of features, agreement of what done is for each iteration, and a demonstration
to prove the deliverables work.
11-3c Quality Baseline
The project work should be clearly defined by this point, in a scope statement and/or a work
breakdown structure. Appropriate quality standards are selected for the materials and other
inputs, work activities, documentation, and project deliverables. These standards might be
industry norms, customer-specific standards, or government regulations. The project manager
is ultimately responsible for selecting appropriate standards and developing additional stan-
dards that may be needed. However, project managers normally take their cues from func-
tional managers and SMEs for many standards dealing with methods and from customers
on standards dealing with documentation and deliverables.
The quality baseline reflects the agreed upon quality objectives. It can include metrics that
define exactly what will be measured, how each will be measured, and the target value of each.
11-3d Process Improvement Plan
A process improvement plan is “a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. It
details steps for analyzing processes to identify activities that enhance their value.”10 Pro-
cess improvement was discussed earlier in the process management core concept.
11-3e Quality Assurance
Perform quality assurance is “the process of auditing the quality requirements and the
results from quality control measurements to ensure appropriate quality standards and
operational definitions are used.”11 This is a broad set of proactive management activities
designed to give key stakeholders confidence that sensible methods and capable people
are working on the project. This hopefully yields good project deliverables and

documentation. Quality assurance is one way to simultaneously improve quality and
manage stakeholder relations.
Perhaps quality assurance is best understood by considering two of its primary meth-
ods: the quality audit and process analysis. A quality audit is “a structured, independent
process to determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies,
processes, and procedures.”12 It is used to determine what methods are being used
(hopefully the methods determined in the quality baseline) and whether they are effec-
tive. For audits to be effective, people need to be convinced that the real purpose is to
improve work methods and not to punish individuals.
Process analysis “follows the steps outlined in the process improvement plan to identify
needed improvements.”13 It can follow an improvement model such as the DMAIC method
shown in Exhibit 11.6 or the PDCA model shown in Exhibit 11.8. Process improvement is
used to improve both quality and productivity. Process improvement can be of a continuous
nature, in which many incremental improvements are made over time, or of a breakthrough
nature, in which a substantial change is planned and implemented at once.
11-3f Control Quality
Control quality is “the process of monitoring and recording results of executing the
quality activities to assess performance and recommend necessary changes.”14 This
detailed set of reactive technical activities verifies whether specific project deliverables
meet their quality standards. Quality control may include inspection of inputs, activities,
and deliverables. It includes a work performance reporting system. Change requests are
an output of quality control. These requests may include recommendations for:
•
Preventive actions—“an intentional activity that ensures the future performance of
the project work is aligned with the project management plan.”15
•
Corrective actions—“an intentional activity that realigns performance of the project
with the project management plan.”16
•
Defect repair—“an intentional activity to modify a nonconforming product or

Literally hundreds of tools have been developed to help organizations manage the quality
of their processes. Many of these tools are variations of each other and have multiple
names. Many of the quality tools can be applied specifically to managing project quality.
Exhibit 11.12 lists some of the more frequently used project quality tools with brief
descriptions. Since many of these tools can also be used on projects for areas in addition
to quality, the chapter in which each first appears is also listed.
11-5 Develop Project Management Plan
Chapters 5 through 11 have all dealt with aspects of project planning. On small, simple
projects, the various portions of this planning may be combined to a large extent. On
larger, more complex projects, specific methods are often used to plan the various project
aspects separately, such as cost, schedule, resources, communications, risk, and quality. If
they have not been planned together, they need to be compiled into a unified project
management plan. Conflicts need to be resolved. A configuration management system
needs to be selected or developed. The project manager should apply a sanity test to all
project plans. There is often a formal project kickoff of some sort, and after everything is
306
Part 2 Planning Projects

agreed, the scope, schedule, budget, and so forth are baselined, and the baseline becomes
part of the project management plan.
On agile projects the overall plan for the project (called the release plan) is only at a high
level, while the detailed plans for each iteration are baselined right before each iteration starts.
11-5a Resolve Conflicts
Sometimes, when all parts of the plan come together, it becomes obvious that the overall
plan is impractical. If this occurs, the key stakeholders may need to determine their

priorities and tradeoffs. What do they really most want and need from the project? Are
all of the quality standards truly mandatory, or can one of them be relaxed a bit? Is the
imposed deadline really critical, or, seeing the impact it poses for costs and risks, can it
be relaxed a bit? Is the budget a true maximum, or can it be adjusted to secure the
desired features? These questions and others like them have probably been asked all
along, but now they take on added urgency because once the project plan is approved
it may be more difficult to make these changes.
11-5b Establish Configuration Management
Project planning can be hard work. Once the plan is in place, it still takes hard work to
control the project. One last part of planning is to create a configuration management
system to aid in that control. A configuration management system is “a collection of
formally documented procedures used to … identify and document functional and phys-
ical characteristics of a product, result, service or component; control any changes;
record and report each change; and support the audit … to verify conformance to
requirements.”18
11-5c Apply Sanity Tests to All Project Plans
A common saying is appropriate to consider here: “can’t see the forest for the trees.”
This means that sometimes a person is so concerned with details that they forget the
big picture. During the first project stage (initiating), the primary deliverable the team
created was a charter. The charter is a high-level look at a project, so seeing the big pic-
ture was easy. During the more detailed planning stage, however, the team looked in
great detail at scope, schedule, resources, cost, communications, risks, and quality. Now
they need to step back a bit and ask if these all work well together. The project manager
and core team should apply a sanity test to their project plans by asking one another
questions to be sure that the plan makes sense. Some of these questions could be as
follows:
•
Does the critical path look reasonable?
•
Do the milestones look achievable?
•
Are some resources overallocated?
•
Does everyone understand what they are supposed to do?
•
Do we really understand our customers?
•
Are the customers’ desires likely to change?
•
How well do we understand the standards we will be judged against?
•
Are the methods for completing our work really sensible?
•
Are we confident we can gather and analyze the data we need to control this?
11-6 Kickoff Project
Project kickoff meetings are conducted for many reasons. First, everyone should
express their legitimate needs and desires and should strive to understand the desires
of all the other stakeholders. If the leader charged with accomplishing the project
does not have the full authority to direct all of the project work activities, she needs
to use her influence to get everyone excited about the project, to feel pride in their
participation, to feel they share in the risks and rewards the project offers, and to be
motivated to self-manage as much as possible. Many people may have helped with
some parts of the project planning. This is their chance to see how all the parts fit
together. Since many projects fail because of “touch points” where one worker hands
308
Part 2 Planning Projects

off work to another, it is critical for all parties to understand these potential trouble
spots. Kickoff meetings are also helpful in convincing all the project stakeholders that
the project leaders (sponsor, project manager, and core team) will be good stewards
of the customer’s and the parent organization’s assets. Answering any remaining
questions and overcoming lingering concerns helps to accomplish this. Finally, all
interested parties (outside customers, top management, functional managers, frontline
workers, and any others) should be eager to commit to the project and get on with
the work!
11-6a Preconditions to Meeting Success
Several preconditions that must be met for project kickoff meetings to be successful are
as follows:
•
The sponsor and project manager need to set clear direction during the planning.
•
The core team needs to commit to the project first—it is hard for them to convince
others if they do not believe in it themselves.
•
An atmosphere of trust and relationship building should be set by all.
•
Project leaders need to practice active listening to uncover potential problems.
•
As many people as possible should be included in parts of the planning to enhance
chances so they will buy in to the resulting project plan.
11-6b Meeting Activities
The formality of a kickoff meeting can vary considerably depending on the size and type
of project. Typical activities that might be included in the kickoff meeting are the
following:
•
The sponsor and project manager describing the importance of the project
•
The customer(s) describing their acceptance standards, sense of urgency, and budget
concerns
•
The project manager outlining the project goals
•
The project manager and the core team describing work expectations
•
The project manager unfolding the project plan and its current status (if work has
commenced)
•
The core team explaining the communications, risk, and quality plans
•
Everyone asking questions and making suggestions
•
The project manager authorizing appropriate changes to the project plan
•
Everyone concurring with the overall plan and to his or her individual action items
On small, simple projects, the charter presentation and signing can take the place of a
kickoff meeting. However, on many projects, the team needs to perform much more
detailed planning after the charter is signed. Project kickoff meetings are vital for com-
munications and commitment on these projects. Exhibit 11.13 is an example of how the
information systems and technology division of a major healthcare company kicks off a
project.
11-7 Baseline and Communicate Project
Management Plan
Once the project plan is complete and accepted by the stakeholders, the plan is baselined.
A baseline is the approved plan. Many project plans are developed iteratively as more
information comes to light. A project plan is considered to be in draft form until enough
Chapter 11 Project Quality Planning and Project Kickoff
309

information is available for the key stakeholders to commit to all of the details and
baseline the plan. At that point, it becomes official, and any changes in the future need
to be formally approved and documented.
This is a time of great joy, because this marks the transition between planning
and executing the project. In reality, on many projects, some activities that are on
the critical path or nearly critical paths are started before the official project kickoff.
Planning also continues in the form of replanning to adjust to changing circum-
stances. However, the majority of planning is done, and the majority of executing
is just starting.
The project management plan needs to be communicated in accordance with the
communications plan requirements. Hopefully, many of the key stakeholders are able
to attend the kickoff meeting. Regardless of who is present, proper communication needs
to be sent to all stakeholders.

11-8 Using MS Project for Project Baselines
MS Project can be used as a tool to automate and communicate many facets of a project.
However, those involved in the project should be sure that they are ready to use it effec-
tively. Before a baseline is created with MS Project, the following should be verified:
•
Quality assurance and quality control activities are included.
•
Risk response plan activities (or duration compensation) are included.
•
Performance posting activities are included.
•
All “hard” date constraints are incorporated.
•
A realistic start date is chosen.
•
Resource overloads are addressed.
•
Organizational holidays are entered.
•
Resource vacations are entered.
•
Resource allocations are realistic.
•
A management reserve is in the schedule.
•
A contingency reserve is in the schedule.
•
Time and cost tradeoffs are applied to the schedule.
11-8a Baseline the Project Plan
Microsoft Project supports three sets of activity metrics, each set having five fields. The
sets are used for cross-comparison purposes to better understand impacts, such as prog-
ress or requested change. The sets and their field names are shown in Exhibit 11.14.
The first column is often referred to as the scheduled values. These values are based
on current project information. They are recalculated if an input to MS Project’s calcula-
tion algorithm changes. Inputs include estimated duration, work, and cost. Progress
information such as actual start, actual finish, actual duration, actual cost, and actual
work causes recalculation. Changing information such as resource assignments, con-
straints, working time, lead-lag values, and the project start date can also cause a recal-
culation of the scheduled values.
MS Project’s baseline is a set of five activity metrics, sometimes called the planned
values. The five are the activity baseline start, activity baseline finish, activity baseline
duration, activity baseline cost, and activity baseline work. These values, together with
project quality and scope targets, are what the stakeholders agreed to, approved, and
expect as key measures of project success. Collectively, these values and targets, along
with the risk and communications plans, form the project management plan.
The project manager can use MS Project to compare the baseline with actual sched-
ule, work, and cost variance values and display these graphically and in tables. This com-
parison can be used to predict future impacts to time and cost targets. With this

understanding, project managers can take action to reduce or eliminate undesirable
future impacts. This is a powerful capability for the project manager.
11-8b First Time Baseline
Once key stakeholders agree to the project plan, the baseline is created by:
1. On the Project tab, Schedule group, click Set Baseline, then click Set Baseline …
2. The defaults should be accepted as shown in Exhibit 11.15; click OK.
11-8c Subsequent Baselines
For any number of reasons, it may not be useful to continue to manage to the present
baseline. Reasons to change the baseline might include changes to the project scope,
project delay or restart, unavailability of planned resources, slower cash flow than
planned, occurrence of risk events, and quality problems. Remember, any change to the
project baseline must be officially designated as an approved change. If a change has
been approved, then the changed material must be re-baselined, as well as the WBS par-
ents of the new or changed material (step 3 below):
1. Select the changed or added activities, milestones, and WBS elements.
2. On the Project tab, Schedule group, click Set Baseline, then click Set Baseline …
3. Click Selected tasks, then click To all summary tasks.
4. Click OK.
Summary
Deming, Juran, and many other people have contrib-
uted to the modern approaches to quality. The Mal-
colm Baldrige Award, ISO certification, and Six Sigma
each present a framework with many good points. The
contemporary approach to project quality draws upon
all of these sources.

Part 2 Planning Projects

The first concept in contemporary project quality
management is stakeholder satisfaction. It is critical to
understand project stakeholders, prioritize their needs,
manage toward those needs, keep the relationships
strong, and always strive to help ensure that the customer
is capable of using the project deliverables. The second
concept is process management. This includes under-
standing both continual and breakthrough forms of
improvement, seeking the root cause of problems, and
using an appropriate model such as DMAIC to guide
improvement efforts. The third concept is fact-based
management. This entails understanding variation, mak-
ing good decisions regarding what to measure, capturing
and analyzing data correctly, and using the information
in an open and honest decision-making manner. The
final concept is empowered performance. Project man-
agers want to have capable and willing workers through-
out their project and should treat each person as an
individual, ensure people accept responsibility, and strive
to get more done through collaboration.
When project managers perform quality manage-
ment planning, the first thing they need to do is either
adopt the quality policy of their parent organization or
supplement it. The policy should broadly guide their
efforts. The quality plan should include the quality
baseline defining performance expectations. It should
also include instructions for how the quality assurance
and quality control will be handled.
Many quality tools have been developed over the
years, and quite a few of them work well on projects.
Many of these tools can be used in additional project
management activities.
Once the quality management plan and all of
the other subsidiary plans have been developed, it is
time to iron out any inconsistencies between the vari-
ous plans. The overall project management plan needs
to
make
sense.
Quality,
cost,
schedule,
human
resources, risk, and communications may have been
planned somewhat independently on a large project,
and now is the time to make sure they all work well
together.
The project core team usually asks themselves a
number of questions concerning the practicality of
the overall plan and then holds a kickoff meeting
with all of the project stakeholders. Hopefully, the out-
come of the meeting is commitment and excitement all
around. Now, the project officially moves into execu-
tion. While some of the project activities may already
be under way (or even complete), the approval of the
project plan signals the change from primarily plan-
ning to primarily execution. Ongoing planning and
replanning still occur, but managing the performance
of project activities and communicating with various
stakeholders consume much of the project manager’s
time from this point forward.

Example Project
Talk with your sponsor to determine if the organiza-
tion for which you are planning your example project
has a quality policy. If it does, determine whether you
will adopt it as is or ask to augment it. Tell why you
wish to either accept or modify it.
With
your
sponsor,
determine
the
quality
baseline for your project. What standards will you
use?
Perform a stakeholder analysis. After completing the
tool, are there any stakeholders that you didn’t think
of before? Are there any who are opponents? What
actions could you take to try to change those who are
opponents into enthusiasts?
Create a SIPOC for your project. What did you
learn that surprised you? How will your project plan
be different because of what you learned?
Create an agenda for a kickoff meeting for your
project. Conduct the kickoff meeting and capture min-
utes for it. Tell what went as you expected and what
went differently from what you expected.
Baseline your project management plan with the
activity baseline start, activity baseline finish, activity
baseline duration, activity baseline cost, and activity
baseline work shown in MS Project. Also show in
your project management plan the agreed upon quality
and scope targets, risk, and communications plans.

Quality Planning at GTC
Every customer-facing project performed by General
Tool Company (GTC) has an associated Quality Plan
Requirements (QPR) document. The QPR is an output
of the technical review process and is performed by
the Quality Engineer (QE) during the preliminary
planning stages of the project. The QPR is derived
from various source documents, including the
Purchase Order Agreement, Statement of Work,
technical publications, customer flow-down
requirements, and drawing notes. Familiarity with the
customer’s quality system requirements is an
essential element of the review process. It is not
uncommon for a customer to mistakenly leave out
critical quality requirements when issuing a purchase
order or request-for-proposal. However, by being
familiar with the customer’s quality systems and
manufacturing needs, GTC is able to work with the
customer to correct any deficiencies prior to
beginning the manufacturing process.
Through the QPR process, the QE may (and often
does) uncover project risks previously unknown to the
team. Such risks may impact cost, schedule, scope, or
any combination thereof. At a minimum, identified risk
must be investigated by the project manager so as to
ensure there are no changes to the scope of work, as
originally proposed. While many tools exists to identify
and address quality related risks (DMIAC, Ishikawa
Diagram, 5 Whys, etc.), GTC utilizes the Quality
Improvement Action Plan for planning and in-process
management of project risks.
Of course, not all risks are uncovered during the
planning phase. Unsuspecting performance issues can
arise at any point during the project’s lifecycle, and
must be dealt with appropriately to ensure cost,
schedule, and performance objectives are met. In the
example on the following pages, GTC identified, by
way of the supplier scorecard in Exhibit 11.16, delivery
issues associated with a particular aerospace project.
The scorecard led the project team down the
continuous improvement path, in an effort to bolster
the supplier rating. The relationship between the
supplier scorecard and the Quality Improvement Action
Plan is clearly indicated (as well as the marked
improvement in the subsequent quarter).
By working closely with the customer and the QE,
the project manager ensures that the project’s quality

and technical requirements are properly identified and
integrated into the project plan. In addition, the QPR
process provides an opportunity to validate the team’s
underlying assumptions from the bid process. Any
incongruences can be addressed before the
manufacturing process begins, thus giving the project
the best opportunity for a successful outcome. Further,
it is often during the quality planning process that the
customer comes to realize the significant costs
associated with heightened quality and technical
requirements. In a firm-fixed-price environment, this
is the best time for the subcontractor to negotiate
any associated cost impact, as the risk is squarely on
the shoulders of the subcontractor once the purchase
order agreement is accepted.

Project Supply Chain Management
This story was born when I encountered a challenge on another project. The
solution to the previous project became a significant independent project called
Super Absorbent Polymer Turf (SAPTURF). The problem is synthetic turf
systems generate extreme heat of 50 to 60 degrees above the ambient
temperature on the surface, which is unpleasant and even dangerous.
I chose a large multinational based in Europe to partner with on the next
step in commercializing SAPTURF. The firm uses a major American university
as their contract research department. I also set up trials at the University of
Cincinnati to provide a control.
I chose this international partner to work with due to the fact that they are
the market leaders. I still control the intellectual property (IP) and have
entered into an agreement to further test my technology to calibrate the
value. I feel the trials will drive great value and at the same time shift
product development costs to my partner. At the end of the trial a license
agreement will be executed with the appropriate values assigned to up-front

payment, annual minimums, and royalties. This license may be with any firm;
the only contractual provision is that my commercialization partner gets the
opportunity to match any offer.
The SAPTURF project required a strong team. Successful commercialization
of IP is a long shot, so room for project management error is slim. I realized
I would need to compensate for lack of in-house resources. Lack of in-house
resources is an advantage! I was free to look for the best resources including
the following:
•
Need 1—Significant and skilled legal resources were crucial. Few entre-
preneurs can afford to have top legal talent in house.
SAPTURF project solution—Talented and accomplished corporate
lawyer John Gierl of Katz, Teller, Brant, and Hild was invited to join the
SAPTURF team and be compensated on a percentage-of-yield basis.
•
Need 2—Technical validation was very important. The potential end
users are busy people who need to evaluate the product’s credibility.
SAPTURF team solution—Well-known polymer scientist Dr. Ray
Berard, who owns 30-plus patents and has been recognized for his work
with Titleist golf balls and as chief technical officer of Interface Founda-
tion also joined the team on a percentage basis.
•
Need 3—Small enterprises can hardly afford the technical capability and
physical plant required to do R&D and prototyping.
SAPTURF team solution—We identified a capable resource that has
a product that can be a component of our finished product. A division of
German giant BASF was invited to join the team, and their top technical
and sales personnel have been involved in the project on a daily basis.
•
Need 4—There existed a critical need for an organized system of com-
munication and documentation with a team of independent players.
SAPTURF team solution—I chose to use a hosted project manage-
ment tool, Basecamp, to provide the collaborative communication tool
for the SAPTURF project. It has the essential functionality and user-
friendliness required, and can be used in conjunction with more sophis-
ticated project management tools when necessary.

The transition from project planning into project execution is not straightforward. The
most visible portion of the transition occurs when the project stakeholders accept the
project plan and a project kickoff is conducted. However, a certain amount of project
execution often takes place prior to the formal kickoff, and most projects require addi-
tional planning. In this text, we use the topic of supply chain management (SCM) to
help transition into execution because planning and execution topics under the umbrella
of project supply chain management are most easily understood if covered together.
12-1 Introduction to Project Supply Chain
Management
As the opening case illustrates, almost no serious projects are completed from scratch by
in-house personnel anymore. At the beginning of this chapter, let’s first ask a trivial
question: Can you provide a project example that is fully completed by the project orga-
nization itself, without using any products or services from outside suppliers? Most likely
the answer is no. In fact, outsourcing part of project tasks has been a well-established
practice in various industries for a long time. In many cases, companies have to rely on
external suppliers for acquiring many of the unique resources they need. In this chapter,
we consider the inter-organizational purchasing-related issues (hereafter referred to as
supply chain management) in the context of project management.
A supply chain consists of all parties involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a cus-
tomer request. In project management, this request can be made by the project team in
order to acquire some specific product or service required for completing various stages
of the project. The request also can be made by the customer whom the project team
serves. As a result, supply chain operations require managerial processes that span func-
tional areas within individual organizations and link trading partners and customers
across organizational boundaries. In recent years, the topic of supply chain management
has evolved into a systematic approach for managing all material and information flows
across supply chain partners. With its broader coverage and profound impact, project sup-
ply chain management has become a challenge to many firms. Because the ultimate goal of
serving project customers hinges on the systematic performance of partners (including
suppliers, transporters, etc.), supply chain management becomes a critical project manage-
ment activity. However, many companies normally have been concerned with purchasing
and procurement, where the goal was to obtain necessary goods and services at the lowest
possible price. In this chapter, we cover not only traditional procurement and contractual
management topics, but also supplier partnership and collaboration issues.
In this chapter, we define project supply chain management as a system approach to
managing the entire flows of physical products, information, and funds from suppliers
and producers, through resellers, and finally the project organization for creating cus-
tomer satisfaction. A sample project supply chain is shown in Exhibit 12.1.

Part 3 Performing Projects

The traditional purchasing perspective is only concerned with the relationship
between the project team and its supplier(s)—those who supply the project organization
directly. At its most extensive, supply chain management involves strategic and opera-
tional issues concerned with all organizational partners involved in projects. Doubtless,
all supply chain parties need to work together to complete the project faster, better,
and/or cheaper. They all need to remember the tradeoffs determined by the key project
stakeholders for better achieving project outcomes.
In traditional project procurement management literature, purchasing, supply manage-
ment, and procurement are usually used interchangeably to refer to the integration of
related functions to purchase or acquire the needed materials and services for the project
team. Thus, procurement management is not only concerned with the standard steps in
the purchasing process such as recognizing needs, translating needs into commercially
equivalent descriptions, and searching for suppliers. Further responsibilities of a project
supply chain may also include receiving, inspection, storage, inbound and outbound
transportation, and disposal. Project procurement management can also be extended to
cover various stages of the supply chain for providing the necessary goods or services
(e.g., the supplier’s supplier). Though supply chain management (SCM) and project
management (PM) are traditionally separate business areas, we find that integrating
SCM into PM can significantly enhance the effectiveness of project management.
12-1a SCM Components
In particular, this chapter focuses on the following project supply chain management
components:
•
Make-or-buy decisions—which are “decisions made regarding the external purchase
or internal manufacture of a product.”1
•
Contract types—We introduce the contact types and compare their advantages and
disadvantages in case a buy decision is warranted.
•
Collaboration and cooperation—As different firms take care of their own interests, it
is essential to coordinate their project activities to ensure the deliverables are pro-
duced as scheduled.
•
System integration—concerning the tradeoffs among project goals such as time, cost,
and quality.
12-1b SCM Factors
Generally, supply chain management is more important to projects where a large portion
of the work is being subcontracted and more company collaboration is needed. Other
factors include the following:
•
The value of the outsourced products or services relative to the total value of the
project
•
The timing of the work being purchased
•
The capability of the project team
•
The role of the outsourced work in the entire project
•
The number of suppliers required
•
The structure of the procurement supply chain (the number of stages in the supply
chain and the nature of the intercompany relationship)
We also discuss project procurement management. The last section of the chapter
covers how to improve project supply chain performance.
As noted earlier, it is common for a significant part of the value of a project to come
from various external suppliers. It is also increasingly common for some organizations to
Chapter 12 Project Supply Chain Management
323

exist only as coordinators of activities, without having their own capability of offering the
project deliverables. In the meantime, not only do large companies outsource project
tasks, but many small businesses are also doing so. In fact, small firms tend to rely
more on outside resources as they may not have the special capability of in-house execu-
tion for certain project activities.
12-1c SCM Decisions
Some of the major project supply chain management decisions are:
•
Distribution network configuration
•
Inventory control in a supply chain
•
Logistics
•
Supply contracts
•
Distribution strategies
•
Supply chain integration and strategic partnering
•
Outsourcing and procurement strategies
•
Product design
•
Information technology and decision-support systems
In practice, these decisions often involve quantitative analysis. All of these decisions
can play an important role in managing a complex project. The implication is that proj-
ect managers must be aware of these methodologies for ensuring project completion in a
timely and cost-effective way.
12-1d Project Procurement Management Processes
Project procurement management includes the following four processes. The first three
are described here, and closing procurements is covered in Chapter 15, “Finishing the
Project and Realizing the Benefits.”
1. Plan procurement management
2. Conduct procurements
3. Control procurements
4. Close procurements
12-2 Plan Procurement Management
The PMBOK® process plan procurement management is “the process of documenting
project procurement decisions, specifying the approach, and identifying potential sellers.”2
It identifies those project needs that can be met by acquiring products or services from
outside suppliers, determines what to purchase or acquire, and determines when and how
to do so. On some projects, a portion of the services or materials may be sourced from
another company; on other projects, the bulk or even all of the work may be performed
by an external company. A client company needs to plan for purchasing and acquisition,
whether it is for part or all of a project. The needs of the parent organization should be
considered as well as those of the project when deciding how to acquire necessary items
because it may be better for the parent organization to buy an item rather than to rent it
for the current project and then rent it again for a future project.
To effectively plan for purchasing and acquisition of materials and services, a project
team typically finishes most of the project planning so they understand what the true
project needs are. At a minimum, the project team requires a project scope statement,
which is “the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and
324
Part 3 Performing Projects

constraints.”3 Once the requirements are identified, a project manager should be able to
determine whether or not to buy, what to buy, and the quantity to buy.
12-2a Outputs of Planning
One primary output of this planning is a procurement management plan, which is a
“managed component of the project management plan that describes how a project
team will acquire goods and services from outside the performing organization.”4 The
procurement management plan can include guidance for types of contracts to be used,
risk management issues, and how to select potential suppliers. This plan guides the client
company’s efforts through all activities dealing with the acquisition of all the necessary
materials and services to complete the project. Another major output is the procurement
statement of work, which “describes the procurement item in sufficient detail to allow
prospective sellers to determine if they are capable of providing the products, services, or
results.”5 This document should ensure that both the contractor and client companies
understand the work that is being requested in the same clear manner, for example,
offering information such as specifications, quantity desired, quality levels, performance
data, work requirements, and other requirements.
12-2b Make-or-Buy Decisions
Project procurement can be considered from the view of the buyer–seller interface. This
interface exists at all levels of any project supply chain and between businesses internal
to and external to the project organization. Depending on the application areas, the seller
can be called a supplier, supplier’s supplier, or contractor. Depending on the buyer’s
position in the project acquisition cycle, the buyer can be called a customer, a service
requestor, or a purchaser. The seller can be viewed during the contract life cycle first as
a bidder and then as the contracted supplier or vendor.
For any products or services needed in a project, during the purchase planning phase,
the project team determines which project needs can best be met by purchasing or
acquiring products and services from an outside provider and which project needs can
be accomplished by the project team during project execution. Buying from an outside
supplier to meet project needs is a well-established practice. For example, many firms
outsource information technology requirements, accounting work, legal functions, logis-
tics, and so on.
REASONS TO BUY OR SELL The make-or-buy decision is not trivial. It involves intri-
cate issues such as a project organization’s competitive analysis and demand analysis.
The project team also needs to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing
from the viewpoint of time, cost, and performance control. The analysis should also
include both direct and indirect costs so that the final decision is based on equal com-
parisons. The project personnel evaluate alternative suppliers and provide current, accu-
rate, and complete data that are relevant to the buy alternative. Exhibit 12.2 lists a variety
of considerations for make-or-buy decisions.
Most firms begin conducting a strategic outsourcing analysis by identifying their ma-
jor strengths and then building on them. A firm’s competitive advantage is often defined
as lower cost, product differentiation (better quality), and/or responsiveness (fast deliv-
ery). To project teams, these are of different levels of importance, depending on the
wishes of the customer and the progress the project is making at the moment. Project
time-cost analysis often helps generate insights about making efficient procurement deci-
sions. For example, a noncritical activity may be outsourced with a focus on minimizing
cost but not necessarily receiving the fastest delivery. However, during different stages of
a project, a noncritical task can become a critical task, which raises the importance of
Chapter 12 Project Supply Chain Management
325

timing. Factors like this can hold quite different implications for a make-or-buy decision
in difference phases of project execution. While make-or-buy investigations usually begin
with a cost analysis, various qualitative factors frequently portend more far-reaching con-
sequences than does the cost analysis. A thorough investigation is clearly complicated by
the dynamics and uncertainties of various project activities.
OUTSOURCING ISSUES While outsourcing has gained in popularity, there are poten-
tial issues related to outsourcing. Some of these are relatively important with regard to
the goal of projects.
•
Loss of time control for completing project activities
•
Lack of cost control for outsourced activities
•
Gradual loss of special skills for doing some specific activities
•
Loss of project focus and a potential conflict of interest
•
Ineffective management as a result of complicated business interactions
•
Loss of confidentiality and double outsourcing when a third party is used
The concepts and techniques of project supply chain management possess strategic
importance because of these potential issues related to outsourcing. Purchasing can con-
tribute to the achievement of benefits such as higher product quality, shorter lead times,
and lower costs. Project procurement strategies can differ from corporate procurement
strategies because of constraints, availability of critical resources, and specific project
requirements. After making the make-or-buy decision, the project team proceeds to the
next step of project outsourcing for selecting the right supplier and negotiating the
contract.
The outputs of procurement planning also include documents and criteria for
selecting a supplier, if a buy decision has been made. When multiple suppliers are
available, selection standards such as total cost of ownership and risk also need to be
developed.
When a buy decision is made, the client company is attempting to create a situa-
tion in which prospective contractor companies have the capability and motivation
to provide useful and complete proposals that are easy to evaluate and to determine
which best suits the client company’s needs. The client company typically uses
procurement documents, which are “the documents utilized in bid and proposal
activities, which include buyer’s invitation for bid (IFB), invitation for negotiation
(IFN), request for information (RFI), request for quotation (RFQ), request for pro-
posal (RFP) and seller’s responses.”6

Part 3 Performing Projects

Project procurement personnel need to understand the differences between types of
requests so they use the correct one.
•
Request for Information (RFI) is “a type of procurement document whereby the
buyer requests a potential seller to provide various pieces of information related to
the product or service or seller capability.”7 An RFI is used to learn about either the
potential sellers and/or the products or services.
•
Request for Quotation (RFQ) is “a type of procurement document used to request
price quotations from prospective sellers of common or standard products or
services.”8 An RFQ is used to compare prices from various vendors of standards
items.
•
Request for Proposal (RFP) is “a type of procurement document used to solicit
proposals from prospective sellers of products and services.”9 An RFP is often used
to compare different approaches for nonstandard items.
The client company creates evaluation criteria to define how they will evaluate and
rank the proposals. Armed with these documents, the client company is now prepared
to conduct the procurement.
12-3 Conduct Procurements
The second project procurement management process is to conduct procurements,
which is “the process of obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a
contract.”10 Client firms need to decide which potential contractor companies they wish
to solicit and then make sure those companies know about the potential project. Some-
times, firms develop a qualified sellers list and only allow listed companies to submit a
proposal on the upcoming project. Other times, they advertise widely in hopes of attract-
ing new contractors’ interest. In either event, a formal request is normally sent out with
hopes that competent firms will compete for the right to perform the project.
12-3a Sources for Potential Suppliers
Based on the nature of what is being requested in early procurement stages, the project
team usually starts the selection process by establishing a robust list of potential suppli-
ers. The following information sources are frequently used to identify these potential
suppliers:
•
Supplier websites
•
Supplier information files
•
Supplier catalogs
•
Trade journals
•
Phone directories
•
Sales personnel
•
Trade shows
•
Professional organizations and conferences
12-3b Information for Potential Suppliers
Exhibit 12.3 is an example of information sent to potential suppliers who may wish to
qualify for work on an exciting new project.
Once potential contractors submit bids or proposals, the client company applies pre-
viously defined selection criteria to select one or more sellers who are qualified to per-
form the work and are acceptable as sellers. On some projects in which the services or
Chapter 12 Project Supply Chain Management
327

materials are commodities, the selection decision is made mostly or entirely on price. On
other projects, the client chooses the contractor on the basis of life cycle cost—that is, the
cost to both purchase the item and use it for all of its useful life. On still other projects,
price is one of multiple considerations. On more complex projects, the client company
may very well decide that one company is more capable than another on technical, man-
agerial, financial, or experiential grounds. The evaluation criteria developed during the
plan procurement process should guide this decision. For example, a study in Singapore
found that when a client selects a design-build contractor (one who supervises both the
design and construction for a project with many other companies involved), quite a few
factors should be considered, as shown in Exhibit 12.4.
12-3c Approaches Used When Evaluating Prospective Suppliers
After developing a comprehensive list of potential suppliers, the project team needs to
evaluate each prospective supplier individually. The approaches and analyses can
include:
•
Supplier surveys that provide sufficient knowledge of the supplier to make a decision
to include or exclude the firm from further consideration
•
Financial condition analysis that reveals whether a supplier is clearly incapable of
performing satisfactorily
•
Third-party evaluators such as Dun and Bradstreet that can be hired for obtaining
relevant information

EXAMPLE REQUEST FOR SUPPLIER INFORMATION REGARDING
QUALIFICATION
Technology and Call Center Expansion for KEG Corporation
Request for Information
KEG is expanding its global technology and call center in Wichita, Kansas. ACBD Builders, Inc., the
construction company who will be working on the expansion, wants prequalification of all
subcontractors. The expansion project consists of the extension of a one-story building from
500,000 square feet to 700,000 square feet plus the addition of 50,000 square feet of above-ground
parking.
The new portion of the building will be a steel frame on a drilled pier foundation and
the exterior should be similar to the existing structure, consisting of a brick and glass perimeter.
The additional space will be used for a new employee cafeteria, on-site fitness center, and daycare
center. Security and HVAC systems of the existing call center building will also be upgraded during
the expansion. The interior finishes should be similar to the existing structure throughout the
building. The prequalification criteria are:
1.
Previous and similar construction experience—evaluation of previous projects of similar size and
scope with references.
2.
Commitment to safety and a safe work environment—EMR, incident rates, frequency, and severity
rates will be evaluated based upon past experience.
3.
Commitment to quality, schedule, and cost control—past experience with references.
4.
Available resources—quantity of trade workers and depth of resources.
5.
Local and regional business partners—companies within 250 miles are preferred.
6.
Economic inclusion—minority and disadvantaged business participation percentage.
7.
Bonding capacity and rate—both total and available capacity along with bonding rates.

Part 3 Performing Projects

•
Facility visits to allow the project team to obtain first-hand information concerning the
adequacy of the firm’s technological capabilities, manufacturing or distribution
capabilities, and managerial orientation
•
Quality ability analysis that examines the potential supplier’s quality capability
•
Delivery ability analysis that estimates the supplier’s capability to deliver
the required product or services on time; backup solutions can also be
considered
The analyses given above should not necessarily be limited to potential first-tier
suppliers. In some cases where second- or even third-tier suppliers are involved, the
project team needs to evaluate all these suppliers as well. This proactive screening
process usually generates a handful of potential suppliers with good standing. If
the organization has a list of current qualified sellers, it can be the basis for new
projects.
12-3d Supplier Selection
After one or more potential suppliers have passed the evaluation process, the selection
process must begin. The project team now invites potential suppliers to submit bids or
proposals. Procurement documents are used to solicit proposals from various vendors.
The most common procurement document is the request for proposal (RFP). The RFP
can be a foundation for the future working relationship between the buyer and the
supplier. In fact, the proposal prepared by the vendor often becomes a part of the final
contract, as an addendum or exhibit, between the supplier and the vendor. A request for
proposal usually includes the following items:
•
Purchasing overview
•
Basic supplier requirements
•
Technical requirements
•
Managerial requirements
•
Pricing information
•
Appendices
The basic supplier selection decision is a classical decision tree problem. This is a
choice between alternatives under uncertainty. The outcome is concerned with both price

and performance, including delivery time. Does the decision maker wish to trade a
higher price against supply assurance under all circumstances? The difficulty in quantify-
ing all consequences reinforces the need for sound judgment in key decisions.
Evaluation criteria are used to rate proposals and other supplier characteristics. The
criteria can be objective or subjective, and they are often provided in the RFP. Typically,
the most important evaluation criterion is price. Other important ones include the ven-
dor’s technical capability, reputation, and so on. Exhibit 12.5 shows factors in addition to
price that can be used in assessing suppliers.
The project team selects one or more sellers who are both qualified and acceptable as
sellers. Many tools and techniques, including the following, can be used in the seller
selection decision process.
•
Weighting system
•
Independent estimates
•
Screening system
•
Seller rating system
•
Expert judgment
•
Proposal evaluation techniques
The goal of selecting suppliers is to award a contract to each selected seller. A
contract is “a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide the speci-
fied product or service and obligates the buyer to pay for it.”11 A contract establishes a
legal relationship between parties, and it is subject to remedy in the court system. The
project organization can be a seller in dealing with the project owner or customer and
a buyer in a more prevalent procurement setting. In many project management scenar-
ios, the project manager must be aware of how a wide range of contracts is developed
and executed. A procurement contract is awarded to each selected seller. The contract

FACTORS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS
•
Replenishment lead time: This is the lead time between placing an order and receiving the order,
which can be translated into the required responsiveness for purchasing.
•
On-time performance: This affects the variability of the lead time.
•
Supply flexibility: It is the amount of variation in order quantity that a supplier can tolerate
without letting other performance factors deteriorate.
•
Delivery frequency and minimum lot size, which affects the size of each replenishment lot
ordered by a firm.
•
Supply quality: A worsening of supply quality increases the variability of the supply of
components available to the firm.
•
Inbound transportation cost: The total cost of using a supplier includes the inbound
transportation cost of bringing materials in from the supplier.
•
Information coordination capability affects the ability of a firm to match supply and demand.
•
Design collaboration capability.
•
Exchange rates, taxes, and duties can be quite significant for a firm with a global manufacturing
and supply base.
•
Supplier viability is the likelihood that the supplier will be around to fulfill the promises it makes.
This consideration can be especially important if the supplier is providing mission-critical
products for which it would be difficult to find a replacement. If a supplier has two key people
who can each perform the necessary work, the second worker is sometimes considered to be
“truck insurance” in case the first worker gets run over by a truck.

12-4 Contract Types
Different types of contracts can be used as tools in planning acquisitions specified in the
make-or-buy decision. Contracts differ by type with regard to how the risk is distributed
and how the project is performed. The seven most common types of project procure-
ment contracts are shown in Exhibit 12.6.
12-4a Fixed-Price Contracts
A fixed-price contract is “an agreement that sets the fee that will be paid for a defined
scope of work regardless of the cost or effort to deliver it.”12 The most common varia-
tions of fixed-price contracts are firm-fixed-price (FFP), fixed-price-incentive-fee
(FPIFD), and fixed-price-economic-price-adjustment (FP-EPA).
FIRM-FIXED-PRICE (FFP) CONTRACTS are “a type of fixed-price contract where the
buyer pays the seller a set amount as defined in the contract, regardless of the seller’s
cost.”13 Any cost increase due to adverse performance is the responsibility of the seller,
who is obligated to complete the effort. A simple form of a firm-fixed-price contract is a

procurement order for a specified item to be delivered by a certain date for a specified
price, such as a truckload of mulch delivered on the job site of 3110 Elm Street on May
15 for $300.
FIXED-PRICE-INCENTIVE-FEE (FPIF) CONTRACTS are “a type of contract where the
buyer pays the seller a set amount as defined by the contract, and the seller can earn an
additional amount if the seller meets defined performance criteria.”14 An example is a
contract for rebuilding a bridge for a fixed price of $1,250,000 with an incentive of an
extra $3,000 for every day it is complete before the scheduled date of September 15.
The buyer would like to have use of the bridge sooner, and the seller would like to earn
a higher fee, so both have an incentive to finish the project early. Performance incentives
can also include bonuses for better quality, more features, or anything else that the buyer
wishes to maximize and is willing to pay for.
FIXED-PRICE-ECONOMIC-PRICE-ADJUSTMENT (FP-EPA) CONTRACTS are “fixed-
price contracts, but with a special provision allowing for final adjustments to the contract
price due to changed conditions such as inflation changes, or cost increases (or
decreases) for specific commodities.”15 An example is a contract that states the contrac-
tor will receive $400,000 to supply all of the gravel for a project, but the price may be
adjusted based upon market price for gravel at the dates when it is delivered.
Fixed-price contracts provide low risk for the buyer, since the buyer does not pay
more than the fixed price regardless of how much the project actually costs the seller.
Consequently, a seller bidding on a fixed-price project must develop accurate and com-
plete cost estimates and include sufficient contingency costs. Certainly, overpricing
should be avoided, as a competing contractor with a lower price might be selected. In
case the seller does not have a clear understanding about the project scope, the next
type of contract should be considered as an alternative. Cost reimbursable contracts, on
the other hand provide lower risk for the seller and higher risk for the buyer. They are
generally more appropriate when it is difficult to estimate the project cost.
12-4b Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts are “a type of contract involving payment to the seller for
the seller’s actual costs, plus a fee typically representing the seller’s profit.”16 The three
variations of commonly used cost-reimbursement contracts are cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-
plus-award-fee, and cost-plus-incentive-fee.
COST-PLUS-FIXED-FEE (CPFF) CONTRACTS are “a type of cost-reimbursable contract
where the buyer reimburses the seller for the seller’s allowable costs (allowable costs are
defined by the contract) plus a fixed amount of profit (fee).”17 An example is a research
project where all scientist hours spent on the project are paid along with a fee of $5,000
regardless of how many hours the scientist spent.
COST-PLUS-AWARD-FEE (CPFF) CONTRACTS are “a category of contract that
involves payments to the seller for all legitimate costs incurred for completed work,
plus an award fee representing seller profit.”18 An example is a development contract
that pays the contractor $3,000,000 plus puts in escrow an award fee pool of $210,000
and an executive in the customer’s organization has sole discretion of how much of the
award fee pool is given based upon customer satisfaction criteria.
COST-PLUS-INCENTIVE-FEE (CPIF) CONTRACTS are “a type of cost-reimbursable
contract where the buyer reimburses the seller for the seller’s allowable costs (allowable
costs are defined by the contract) and the seller earns a profit if it meets defined
332

performance criteria.”19 These criteria can be for schedule, cost, and/or performance. An
example of a schedule criterion is a contract for constructing a college dormitory that
calls for completion by August 15 so it is ready for the fall semester. A cost criteria
example is the buyer of a small house negotiating a total project cost of $150,000. A per-
formance criteria example is when an auto company enters a contract with a supplier to
develop a battery that can get 55 miles per gallon in a 3,000-pound car. In each of these
cases, the contract can call for the seller to receive a bonus if it does better than the
agreed-upon target and/or a penalty if it does worse. Both the buyer and the seller can
benefit if performance criteria are met.
12-4c Time and Material (T&M) Contracts
Time and material contracts are “a type of contract that is a hybrid contractual
arrangement
containing
aspects
of
both
cost-reimbursement
and
fixed-price
contracts.”20 In this type of contract, the unit rate for each hour of labor or pound
of material is set in the contract as in a fixed-price contract. However, the amount of
work is not set, so the value of the contract can grow like a cost-reimbursement con-
tract. The seller simply charges for what is done to produce the product or service in
the contract. This can be problematic if the time scheduled for production is greatly
underestimated.
In choosing the right type of contract, the nature of the outsourced project activity
plays an important role. The requirements that a buyer imposes on a seller, along with
other planning considerations such as the degree of market competition and degree of
risk, also determine which type of contract is used. The following items are frequently
considered when selecting the right type of contract:
•
Overall degree of cost and schedule risk
•
Type and complexity of requirements
•
Extent of price competition
•
Cost and price analysis
•
Urgency of the requirements
•
Performance period
•
Contractor’s responsibility
•
Contractor’s accounting system
•
Extent of subcontracting
One of the important factors to know is the degree of risk for the seller and the buyer
that each type of contract contains. Each of the contract types has risk attached to it.
When considering different contracts, it must be clear who assumes the most risk—the
buyer or the seller. Under normal conditions, the greatest risk to the buyer is the cost-
plus-fixed-fee contract. The contract with the greatest risk to the seller is the firm-
fixed-price contract. Generally, the buyer and seller negotiate details of the contract that
offer risks and benefits that both parties can accept.
One risk management technique that is rapidly becoming popular for insuring large
projects is the use of wrap-ups. A wrap-up, or owner-controlled insurance program
(OCIP), is a single insurance policy providing coverage for all project participants,
including the owner and all contractors and subcontractors. An OCIP can potentially
reduce an owner’s total project cost by 1 to 2 percent compared to traditional fragmen-
ted programs. Its major advantages include broader coverage, volume discounts, and
reduced claims due to comprehensive loss control programs. The type and complexity
of the agreements may also necessitate assistance from legal specialists, buyers, and con-
tracting experts.
Chapter 12 Project Supply Chain Management
333

12-5 Control Procurements
Control procurements is the “process of managing procurement relationships, monitor-
ing contract performance, and making changes and corrections as appropriate.”21 Both
buyers and sellers administer contracts to make sure that the obligations set forth in
the contract are met and to make sure neither has any legal liability. Both must perform
according to the contract terms. The seller creates performance reports, and the buyer
reviews these reports to ensure that the performance of the seller satisfies the obligations
of the contract.
12-6 Improving Project Supply Chains
Project supply chain performance can be improved by careful and innovative use of part-
nering, third-party involvement, lean purchasing, sourcing, logistics, and information.
12-6a Project Partnering and Collaboration
Companies are constantly in need of outsourcing or contracting significant segments of
project work to other companies. The trend for the future suggests that more and more
projects will involve working with people from different organizations. Research also
finds that through strategic partnering, companies are more likely to access advanced
technology, share risks, and improve project-based performance and relative competi-
tiveness. This section extends the previous discussion of project procurement and con-
tracting by focusing specifically on issues surrounding working with different suppliers
to complete a project. The term partnering is used to describe this process. Partnering
is a method for transforming contractual arrangements into a cohesive, collaborative
project team with a single set of goals and established procedures for resolving disputes
in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The single set of goals takes care of the customer
requirements and the entire project instead of each individual organization. Exhibit 12.7
presents an excellent example of project partnering and collaboration in the international
airport industry.
EXHIBIT 12.7
JORGE CHAVEZ INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, LIMA, PERU
The location of Lima in the center of the south cone and on the west coast of South America presents an extended area of attrac-
tion, making the airport into a natural international hub. The proximity of Jorge Chavez International Airport (JCIA) to Port
Callao, the principal port of Peru, offers the possibility of developing an sea/air plan in favor of external commerce.
LIMA AIRPORT PARTNERS
On November 15, 2000 the Fraport-Bechtel-Cosapi Consortium won the international public tender for the concession of the
JCIA. With an equity contribution of $30 million, the consortium founded Lima Airport Partners (LAP), which began operations
on February 14, 2001. The three consortium partners each have impressive track records. Fraport AG operates the Frankfurt Air-
port, considered one of the largest in continental Europe. Fraport also provides other airport services such as handling and other
commercial services. Fraport participates in more than 50 projects around the world. Bechtel is a private construction company
founded in 1898. It has participated in more than 1000 projects in 67 countries, of which 80 have been airport projects. Cosapi is
a local construction company founded in 1960 with projects in South America. Currently, LAP’s shareholders are Fraport AG, the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Fund for Investment in Infrastructure, Utilities and Natural Resources, managed
by AC Capitales SAFI S.A.
LAP’s objectives are to improve both facilities and operation of JCIA. The improved facilities will be transferred to the State of
Peru. The concession term is 30 years with an option for a 10 year extension.

SOURCES OF CONFLICT DURING PROJECT PURCHASING In the procurement and
purchasing environment, conflicts are inevitable. For example, many people envision the
purchasing process as a type of zero-sum game, meaning what one party loses is what
the other party gains. (The most common type of conflict is this: Lower price means
cost reduction for the buyer, but it also means revenue loss to the seller.) In fact, many
types of interest conflicts arise among different companies. For example, delays in con-
struction are common and expensive, and litigation related to design and construction is
rising. Obvious conflicts of interest predispose owners and contractors to be suspicious
of one another’s motives and actions. Suspicion and mistrust prevent effective problem
solving throughout the process. In taking care of each party’s own interests, mistakes and
problems are often hidden. When conflicts emerge, they often create costly delays as well
as questionable responses simply because the information transferred may be distorted
many times before it reaches the decision maker. The consequences, however, are avoid-
able from the beginning.
RESOLVING PROJECT PURCHASING CONFLICTS One approach to resolving conflict
is to use project partnering as an effective way to engage both the project owner and
contractors. Project partnering naturally developed as people began to realize that the
traditional win/lose adversarial relationship between owner and contractor degenerates
into a costly lose/lose situation for all the parties involved. The systematic project supply
chain management view goes beyond this traditional view to increase the baseline of
trust and collaboration.
Five core sharing requirements for effective project partnerships are shown in
Exhibit 12.8.
MUTUAL GOALS IN PROJECT PARTNERSHIPS Some common goals warrant a more
supportive relationship. For example, both the buyer and seller would like to complete the
project on time and safely. Both parties would prefer to avoid costly and time-consuming
litigation. On the other hand, once the specified project can be finished on a faster and
cheaper basis, either party is in a better position of getting better operational rewards. Some
of the many advantages for establishing a project partnership are shown in Exhibit 12.9.
For example, Procter & Gamble (P&G) started using the Web to share information
and streamline purchasing a few years ago. Ford used 900 virtual work spaces to design
cars and hold meetings. In one project, Ford used digital conference rooms from eRoom
to manage the formation of the auto industry e-marketplace Covisint. Lawyers from law
firms and three automakers shared virtual rooms to haggle over contracts.
EXHIBIT 12.8
SHARING REQUIREMENTS FOR EFFECTIVE PROJECT PARTNERSHIPS
1.
Shared responsibilities—Suppliers and customers share responsibility for outcomes and quality.
2.
Shared resources—Suppliers and customers jointly make resource decisions.
3.
Shared information—Suppliers and customers openly share information with each other,
recognizing that appropriate information power occurs when all parties can utilize all
important information.
4.
Shared rights—Everyone holds the right to disagree, and project managers use dialog to
influence others instead of coercion.
5.
Shared risks—Everyone shares the project rewards and risks.

EFFECTIVE PROJECT PARTNERING APPROACHES Many differences exist between
the way traditional project procurement unfolds and the way contemporary project pro-
curement takes place in a partnering mode. Exhibit 12.10 lists some of the requirements
of effective project partnering.
Many large Japanese manufacturers have found a middle ground between purchasing from
a few suppliers and vertical integration. These manufacturers are often financial supporters of
suppliers through ownership or loans. The supplier then becomes part of a company coalition
known as a keiretsu. Members of the keiretsu are assured long-term relationships and are
therefore expected to function as partners, providing technical expertise and stable quality
production to the manufacturer. Members of the keiretsu can also have suppliers farther
down the chain, making second- and even third-tier suppliers part of the coalition. Most part-
ners value their membership and work hard to do their part. In the rare instance in which a
partner consistently takes advantage of the situation, the partner is eventually dropped.
Companies can use different purchasing modes
for specific purchasing items when dealing with
large projects. For example, one major Chinese
petroleum company used five purchasing models
for multiple projects, which include purchasing
mechanisms for strategic materials, full competitive
products, limited resource products, nonstandard
products,
and
existing

collaboration
suppliers. Third-party inspection companies were
hired to conduct onsite assessment and quality
approval for the incoming materials of multiple
projects at the same time. The integrated onsite
warehousing management system streamlined the
management process, reduced unnecessary inven-
tory to almost zero, and minimized the total
investment of the projects.

SECURING COMMITMENT TO PARTNERING When developing a project supply
chain partnership, a project manager may want to consider contractors with a mu-
tual interest and expertise in partnership. At the beginning, the owner needs to get
the commitment of the top management of all firms involved. All the benefits of the
partnership and how the partnership would work need to be described in detail.
Team building is an effective approach for involving all the key players from differ-
ent firms. Separate training sessions and workshops are offered to promote a collab-
orative spirit. One of the major goals of the team-building sessions is to establish a
“we” as opposed to an “us and them” attitude among the different participants. A
second objective of the sessions is to establish a mechanism in advance designed to
ensure that this collaborative spirit is able to withstand the problems and setbacks
that will invariably occur on the project. Some of the most significant mechanisms
are as follows:
•
Problem resolution—Solving problems at the lowest level of organizations and hav-
ing an agreed-upon escalation procedure
•
Continuous improvement—Endless waste elimination and cost reduction
•
Joint assessment—Reviewing the partnering process jointly
•
Persistent leadership—Displaying a collaborative response consistently
More project organizations are pursuing partnering relationships with each other.
Project partnering represents a proactive way for handling many of the challenges asso-
ciated with working with different organizations. The process usually starts with some
agreed-upon procedures and provisions for dealing with problems and issues before
they happen. One way is to design a contract with specific incentives and penalties. On
the other hand, partnering is not just about relationship contracting. For example,
although many companies may wish to develop company-wide policies and procedures
for interfirm conflict resolution, this method is less effective since each project and each

company is different. The partnering approach has to be dynamic to unite a wide variety
of suppliers and contractors for some common goals that everyone cares about.
Although the project purchasing relationship has been moved from short-term arrange-
ments based on contracts to long-term relationships based on trust, this change is by no
means universally applicable.
Partnering fosters a strong desire to contain costs when changes are necessary and
leads to a team approach in resolving any financial and time consequences. In the next
section, we discuss the integrated project supply chain management approach.
Partnering seeks to recast relations between actors in projects by promoting the use of
collaborative, more open relationships. The integrated supply chain perspective further
shifts traditional channel arrangements from loosely linked groups of independent busi-
nesses that buy and sell products or services to each other toward a managerially
coordinated initiative to increase customer satisfaction, overall efficiency, continuous
improvement, and competitiveness. For example, in the construction industry, the con-
struction supply chain (CSC) consists of all the construction partners such as client,
designer, general contractor, subcontractor, supplier, and consultant. In fact, the CSC
itself represents a concept of systematic coordination of relevant business activities
within the supply chain.
12-6b Third Parties
In general, third parties can increase the supply chain performance effectively if they are
able to aggregate supply chain assets or flows to a higher level than a firm can by itself.
Third parties can use various mechanisms to grow the supply chain performance
(e.g., reducing delivery time and cost), by aggregating:
•
Capacity
•
Information
•
Inventory
•
Receivables
•
Transportation
•
Relationships
•
Warehousing
12-6c Lean Purchasing
Lean purchasing refers primarily to a manufacturing context and implementation of just-
in-time (JIT) tools and techniques to ensure every step in the supply process adds value
while various costs are kept at the minimum level. By reducing ordering cost for placing
orders (e.g., the fixed part of the shipping cost), project organizations can use JIT for
eliminating waste in ordering time and cost, which eventually results in timely comple-
tion of projects and customer satisfaction.
Doubtlessly, integrating SCM into project management helps project managers create
win/win situations for all parties involved in the project supply chain as they become
more efficient and effective. The specific supply chain techniques can help project man-
agers make better tradeoffs between project cost and time so as to create better customer
satisfaction.
12-6d Sourcing
Sourcing encompasses all processes required for a firm to purchase goods from suppliers.
Effective sourcing decisions thus have a significant impact on project performance. Good
project sourcing decisions can improve project performance by aggregating orders, mak-
ing procurement transactions more efficient, achieving design collaboration with suppli-
ers, facilitating coordinated forecasting and planning with suppliers, and improving
customer satisfaction.
338
Part 3 Performing Projects

12-6e Logistics
Logistics, in contrast to supply chain management, is the work required to move and
position inventory throughout a supply chain. Supply chains use a combination of the
following modes of transportation:
•
Air
•
Water
•
Package carrier
•
Pipeline
•
Truck
•
Intermodal
•
Rail
The transportation cost a supply chain incurs is closely linked to the degree of
responsiveness the supply chain aims to provide. Thus, decision makers must consider
the tradeoff between responsiveness and transportation cost when making the relevant
logistics decisions. Moreover, the necessity of shipping speed needs to be considered, as
noncritical project activities tend to have some slack.
12-6f Information
On the other hand, information is also key to the success of project supply chain
management because it enables management to make decisions over a broad scope that
crosses both functions and firms. For instance, information sharing in many cases
can allow the project supply chain to shorten the delivery time and, at the same
time, offer better-quality products or services to meet the dynamic demand of a project.
Information must have the following characteristics to be useful when making supply
chain decisions:
•
Accurate
•
Accessible in a timely manner
•
Of the right kind
Information is a key ingredient not just at each stage of the project supply chain, but
also within each phase of supply chain decision making. This is where IT comes into
play. IT consists of the hardware, software, and people throughout a project supply chain
that gather, analyze, and execute upon information. In today’s business world, IT-based
information management is crucial to the performance of project supply chains simply
because it provides the basis of decision making, which has profound impacts for every
aspect of project management.
Summary
More and more companies are seeking cooperative
relationships with each other to compete in today’s
demanding marketplace. Project supply chain man-
agement represents a set of proactive responses to
many challenges created by people from different
organizations working together on one-time projects.
By identifying the project needs and wants, project
organizations start with assessing the need to out-
source part of the project work. Contracting is com-
monly used to specify and manage supplier-buyer
relationships. Purchasing details such as scope, deli-
verables, and quality expectations are legally enforced
in the contract. As such, project teams take great care
in selecting a specific and attainable contract to meet
customer delivery expectations and internal profit-
ability goals. However, project supply chain manage-
ment is not just about contracting. Partnering and
coordination of purchasing across all supplier stages
allow a firm to maximize economies of scale in pur-
chasing and also to reduce transaction costs.

Implications for Project Management in a Networked Organization Model
What Is a Networked Organization?
Simply put, a networked organization is one in which you
identify the core competencies that are unique to your
company or organization and focus on building and
retaining this competitive advantage. You then build
alliances with best-in-class companies, service providers,
and even unique individuals who provide services and
capabilities for your company in the areas outside of your
designated core competencies.
This is an “open” organizational model in which a
company focuses on its core unique equity and
operates as a central hub to continuously connect and
exploit the best alliances it needs to be very successful
in its business model(s). Alliances are based on unique
special skills or capabilities and can come from
government, universities, service provider companies,
and even peer companies.
This new business model drives speed and greater
value since you are no longer constrained by your
existing capacity and you can leverage resources
outside your own company.
An Example—Procter & Gamble’s
Connect and Develop Strategy
Procter & Gamble (P&G) recognized in 2000 that it
would not be able to maintain the levels of top-line
growth of sales and profit that its business goals
demanded by continuing to do new product
innovation with its own research and development
employees. The strategy was not to replace the
capabilities of these 7,500 researchers and support
staff but to better leverage them. P&G’s CEO, A. G.
Lafley, established a goal that 50 percent of P&G’s
new products would come “from our own labs and
the other half would come through them.” P&G
discovered that for every P&G researcher there
were 200 scientists or engineers elsewhere in the
world who were just as good—a total of 1.5 million
people whose talents it could potentially utilize.
Therefore, P&G created an open innovation model
called “Connect & Develop” in which its research
and development (R&D) organization was now
defined as 7,500 people inside plus 1.5 million
Chapter 12 Project Supply Chain Management
343

outside. The model is working at P&G as described in
a recent Harvard Business Review article.16
Impact on Managing Projects with
Alliance Partners
P&G’s R&D Connect & Develop is a prime example of a
networked organization. P&G has taken this approach
and expanded it through much of the company,
establishing strategic alliances for everything from
contract manufacturing, to PC desktop support, to
running its global buildings and real estate, to running
and supporting the computer data centers used to run
the operations of the company worldwide.
The challenge that this new organizational model
introduces at a scale not seen before is that, “in a world
where many of your operations and business
processes are run by a significant number of external
business partners, many if not most projects will need
to be staffed with people from not only your company
but with people from multiple organizations. How
should we address these new types of projects from a
project management perspective?”
Key Learning from P&G’s
Networked Organization Project
Management
1. You need to adopt an industry standard project
management methodology so you and all your
alliance partners can speak a common language and
use a common framework and methodology. Since
2003, P&G has adopted and is broadly using the
Project Management Institute (PMI) methodology.
The key message here is, in projects that involve
one or more alliance partner organizations, your
project management approach needs to become
more formal, documented, and rigorous. This does
not mean bureaucratic! It does, however, mean that
shortcuts that existed when everyone was from the
same company and culture and knew how to work
together need to be replaced by simple but more
formal rules of the game.
2. As you build mastery in your own organization’s
project management capability, you will need to
also adopt an industry-standard certification
process for qualifying your people. At P&G, project
management is one of our core competencies, with
four levels of proficiency: basic, proficient,
advanced, and master. P&G provides the training
required for basic and proficient levels of project
management, but all advanced- and master-level
training is done exclusively with industry standard
training offerings.
3. The five major topics within the PMI methodology in
which these new types of alliance partner projects
force new and different approaches are:
•
Monitoring and controlling
•
Communication
•
Risk
•
Human resources
•
Procurement
A top-line identification of the types of required
changes for projects with one or more alliance partners
is discussed in the following sections.
Monitoring and Controlling
•
First of all, it must be clear who the project manager is.
You only have one project manager per project! At
P&G, the project manager in nearly every project (with
only rare exceptions) is a P&G person with the right
level of skill and experience in project management.
•
You need to have very simple and clear expecta-
tions on how schedule, costs, quality of tasks, and
risks are accounted for and tracked across all orga-
nizations whose people who are on the project and
how often (daily, weekly, or monthly).
Communication
•
Again, you need to be clear regarding what people
in each organization need to be communicated to,
on what topics, how often, at what level of detail,
and using what media.
•
Methods for accessing information between scheduled
communications need to be known and available.
Risk
•
Define, document, and communicate your risk man-
agement plan (methodology, roles and responsibili-
ties, budgeting, and timing).
•
Define and follow a process for risk identification.
•
Define and follow an approach for risk analysis and
response (avoid, mitigate, accept, or transfer).
Human Resources
•
Identify the specific role and responsibility for each
project team member.
344
Part 3 Performing Projects

•
Acquire a level of mastery in talking with alliance
partners and suppliers about what skills you need
and how they are measured so that, as you assem-
ble the team from various organizations, you know
how to get the skills you require.
•
Politics!—It is inevitable that with multiple organiza-
tions involved in staffing and executing a project, the
goals and objectives and what is rewarded within
each organization will play out in either explicit or im-
plicit behavior. Your project manager needs to have a
level of savvy and experience to be effective at dealing
with this level of political activity.
Procurement
You need to be explicit in identifying a framework of
the different types or categories of projects you expect
to be involved in with your alliance partner(s) and lay
out guidelines on when you use which approach or
type of engagement.
In P&G’s relationship with one of its strategic
alliances, different types of projects have been
classified in a basic framework that lets P&G people
and people from the alliance organization know when
to use which type of project.
PROJECT TYPE
WHEN TO USE
Staff Augmentation
When there is need of a particular resource on a project for a short
period of time
Time and Materials
Where there is a high risk associated with the project, coming from
technical unknowns or simply unclear or changing requirements
Fixed Price Project
When there are clear project requirements and both parties agree that
the level of risk identified in the project enables a fixed-bid approach
Flexible Resource Pool
Used primarily for change requests for existing applications
Generic Service Request (GSR)
Used for small, simple projects, usually no longer than one effort
month, and involving only the alliance partner and no other vendors
Rough Order of Magnitude
Used to obtain an estimate of the cost required to execute a project;
this is the only deliverable for this type of engagement

Leading and Managing Project Teams
Gallup Consulting is a global research-based consultancy, specializing in
employee and customer management. Our goal is to take discoveries in
behavioral
economics
and
apply
them
to
management
and
business
problems. Every organization has an enormous, but largely untapped,
potential for breakthrough improvements in productivity through leveraging
how human nature drives business performance. This unrealized potential
can be measured and managed to improve performance.
Our consulting work is managed as a series of projects. At the start of
each client engagement, project leaders gather the high-level information
required to identify the client’s problems and possible remedies, while
understanding any constraints that will affect project success over the long
term. The resulting project charter is a business case for the project and a
description of how Gallup will add value to the client’s organization.
Codifying these commitments also helps in enumerating the roles and
responsibilities of the project team members.

Staffing a team is critical to project success. Our research shows that
there are three keys to being an effective project leader:
1. Knowing and investing in your own strengths and the strengths of your
project team.
2. Getting people with the right talents on your team.
3. Satisfying the four basic needs of those who follow your leadership:
trust, compassion, stability, and hope.
By “strength,” I mean an ability to provide consistent, near-perfect
performance in a specific activity. The first step to building a strength is to
identify your greatest talents—the ways in which you most naturally think,
feel, or behave. Strengths are created when your naturally powerful talents
are combined with learnable skills, such as how to put together a project
budget. Gallup has studied more than 6 million people, and we have found
that individuals have much more potential for growth and productivity in
areas of great talent than areas of weakness.
A strengths-based approach improves team cohesion and generates better
results. We have found that high-performing teams are more likely to match
individuals’ talents to assigned tasks and emphasize individual strengths
versus seniority in making personnel decisions. High-performing teams also
have leaders who meet the needs of trust, compassion, hope, and stability.
We have found that while each team member has his or her own unique
strengths, the most successful and cohesive teams possess a broader array of
strengths. A tool like the Clifton StrengthsFinder® is useful for helping team
members identify the ways they can best contribute to the team’s goals. Our
research shows that the 34 StrengthsFinder themes naturally cluster into
these four groups:
1. Executing—making things happen
2. Influencing—reaching a broader audience
3. Relationship building—holding the team together
4. Strategic thinking—focusing on all the possibilities
The student website describes these strengths from a project management
perspective and tells you how to discover your own unique strengths.

At this point in a project, all of the original planning is complete. There is often a need
for replanning some portions that require change and a need to plan the later sections of
some projects if they were only planned at a rough level earlier. Also at this point,
suppliers to the project and customers of the project have normally been engaged. Of
primary concern now is the need to perform according to the plans that were so
diligently created. The hard work of planning will prove to be worthwhile if the plans
are used. The plans often evolve through the change control process, but they still direct
project performance.
An experienced project manager envisions project performance as two related activi-
ties. First, people must perform their roles in completing work activities according to the
plan. Performance by people is the topic of this chapter. Second, data must be collected
and used to determine the project progress and results. Data collection and determining
project progress as measured in schedule, cost, quality, and risk terms are the subject of
Chapter 14. While determining progress and results is conducted largely in parallel with
people performing the project, the two are covered in separate chapters to emphasize
exactly what needs to be done in each.
“Management is the attainment of organizational goals in an effective and efficient
manner
through
planning,
organizing,
leading,
and
controlling
organizational
resources.”1 The first 11 chapters and part of Chapter 12 of this book deal primarily
with planning and organizing. Chapter 14 deals mostly with controlling, and this chapter
deals mostly with leading. “Leadership is the influencing process of leaders and followers
to achieve organizational objectives through change.”2 While certain aspects of both
management and leadership are necessary in dealing with project teams, in the contem-
porary approach to projects, the project manager works collaboratively with the project
team to the extent possible while continually pushing to reach project goals.
This chapter starts with acquiring the project team up to the point that team
members have been successfully brought on board to the project. The second section
deals with various activities needed to develop the project team’s capability—many of
which require leadership from the project manager. The third section includes several
considerations for the project manager when managing the performance of the project
team. The fourth section is how to manage and control stakeholder engagements. Finally,
when dealing with both team members and stakeholders, conflict sometimes occurs. The
last section discusses project conflict and resolution.
13-1 Acquire Project Team
Acquire project team is “the process of confirming human resource availability and
obtaining the team necessary to complete project assignments.”3 Chances are the core
team has already been assembled, as it is very helpful to have the core team together
for planning—and even earlier, for chartering a project. However, on some projects,
some core team members may be added later. Also, on many large projects, many
subject matter experts (SMEs) may be added at this point. This section deals with the
timing of assigning a project team member (preassignment), securing the needed and
desired team members (negotiation), and successfully adding them to the project team
(on-boarding).
13-1a Preassignment of Project Team Members
Generally, it is helpful to a project to assign both core team members and SMEs as
early as possible. One reason is that people often do not like to be told what they must
do, but are often enthusiastic when they help create a plan. Therefore, it is good for
348
Part 3 Performing Projects

motivation to include the implementers in planning. A second reason is that when the
people who will perform the work help to plan it, many more details may be considered
and the resulting plans are often more realistic. Yet another reason to assign project team
members early is to be sure they will be available when needed. For external projects, it
is common to list specific workers who will be assigned to a project team in the proposal.
If the project is secured, it is helpful to bring them onto the project as quickly as
possible.
The downside to bringing SMEs on board before they need to complete project
activities is that they cost money. For a highly paid expert, this can be substantial and
impractical. Another problem with bringing people on board early is that they may first
be committed to finishing work on a previous project. Regardless of how early you bring
a person on a project, it is helpful to keep communications open with both that person
and his or her boss so they understand when the person is needed. This is especially
critical if the project has a tight deadline and/or if your organization is using critical
chain project management.
13-1b Negotiation for Project Team Members
Depending on the norms of the organization, a project manager may need to negotiate
with the functional manager and/or a worker directly to secure his or her services for a
project. The functional manager (perhaps called a department head or line manager) has
the responsibility of running his or her department. For example, the head of accounting
is responsible for how accounting is performed. She wants to keep all of her workers
busy, but not too busy, and wants all of her workers to progress in their capability. The
functional manager may see this project as a good opportunity for some on-the-job
training to help a newer employee gain experience. The project manager, on the other
hand, wants the “best” resource for his or her project. The best resource may already
be busy. Wise project managers often develop good relationships with functional
managers so it is easier to negotiate for a good worker. Each manager may look at the
situation from the perspective of his or her own department or project and have different
ideas of who is the appropriate person to work on the project. A project manager cannot
expect to have the best resource from every department (unless perhaps the project is the
highest priority project for the company). The functional manager may sometimes need
to agree to a different resource from what he or she prefers. In short, most projects have
a combination of experienced and inexperienced resources. If a project manager finds all
functional managers are only offering inexperienced people, he should probably ask his
sponsor for help.
In many organizations, project managers also need to persuade workers to work on
their project. For experienced project managers, reputation goes a long way. A project
manager can earn a reputation of being a good boss by caring for team members, help-
ing people develop, and assisting them in securing interesting work and promotions at
the end of a project. Many workers campaign hard to work for a great project manager
and avoid a poor project manager. When negotiating with a potential team member, a
project manager wants to sell the person on the project. Of course, strong technical
skills are important for SMEs and are helpful for core team members. However, espe-
cially for core team members, it may be more critical to be an excellent generalist.
Many core team members need to deal with a variety of issues beyond their discipline,
and focus on making tradeoffs that key stakeholders demand so they can finish the
project.
Sometimes, it is necessary to recruit project team members from outside of the parent
organization. Tatro, Inc., uses this strategy, as described in Exhibit 13.1.
Chapter 13 Leading and Managing Project Teams
349

13-1c On-Boarding Project Team Members
The ideal time to on-board team members, and even a few SMEs, is when the charter
is being written. When that is not possible, the first thing a project manager might do is
e-mail the charter and the minutes from the last couple of project meetings to the new
member. Once the person has read them, the project manager can have a one-on-one
discussion with the new member. There are several purposes to this discussion. The first
is to ensure that the new person both understands the project at a high level and is
enthusiastic about being part of it. The second is to learn about the person’s personal
motives. The most effective and happy workers are those who understand how their per-
sonal goals and project goals are aligned. Does he or she want to experience the joy of
working on something new, travel, training, new coworkers, and so on? What unique
strengths does he or she already bring to the project, and what strengths does he or she
want to further develop? At this point, the project manager can accomplish the third
purpose of the talk, which is to assign the new worker to specific activities and develop
a plan for personal improvement. Exhibit 13.2 illustrates how one consulting company
that has many projects acquires and on-boards resources.
13-2 Develop Project Team
Develop project team is “the process of improving the competencies, team member
interaction, and overall team environment to enhance project performance.”4 Developing
a highly effective project team requires the following six activities from the project
manager. Note these six activities build upon each other and are overlapping.
1. Understand stages of project team development.
2. Understand characteristics of high-performing project teams.
3. Assess individual member capability.
4. Assess project team capability.
5. Build both individual and team capability.
6. Establish team ground rules.
EXHIBIT 13.1
TATRO, INC., STRATEGY FOR RECRUITING PROJECT TEAM MEMBERS
Tatro, Inc., is a designer and builder of high-end landscape projects. Its strategy is to retain its core
strengths of securing contracts, designing exceptional landscapes, and managing projects with
demanding clients. It subcontracts most other work, but wants to be very careful that the work is
done as well as possible. Tatro understands it needs to have self-motivated workers who are very
presentable to discriminating clients. Tatro primarily relies on recommendations to identify poten-
tial workers. To screen potential workers, Tatro performs extensive background checks. It examines
previous work performed by the worker, talks to previous clients, and attempts to ensure the work-
er’s finances will allow him or her to be stable.
At that point, it attempts to recruit these proven workers. Chris Tetrault, president of Tatro,
Inc., states that he uses a combination of four strategies to recruit, as follows:
1. Pay well.
2. Pay quickly.
3. Provide signature projects for the workers to showcase their skills.
4. Try to get them to like me.

Project teams typically go through a predictable set of stages as they work together. By
effectively using project tools and developing trust and understanding within their teams,
project managers can greatly diminish some of the negative aspects of project team
development stages. While almost all teams go through these stages, just as one child
may spend more time in a particular stage of human development, some project teams
spend more time in certain stages of team development. Some teams get “stalled” in an
early stage and do not progress. Some get further along and then have a setback.
Setbacks for project teams can come from losing or gaining core team members or
SMEs, changes in project requirements, quality problems with project deliverables, or
other reasons. The good news for a team that suffers a setback is that because they
worked through the team development stages once, they can probably work through
the stages more quickly the second time. The bad news is that they do need to work their
way through.
Each stage of team development has its own challenges. For a project manager to
successfully help a team develop, he or she should be aware of how team members feel
and what behaviors they frequently attempt at each stage. Armed with that understand-
ing, he or she can develop strategies to promote the needs of the parent organization, the
project, and the team members. Quite a few of these strategies can be implemented by

ACQUIRING AND ON-BOARDING RESOURCES AT ATOS-ORIGIN
Resources are the most important assets of a consulting company. It becomes very important to
nurture them, utilize them effectively, and at the same time make money for the company. At
Atos-Origin (a leading IT consulting company), a structured process is followed to manage
resources. Resource skills, credentials, and travel preferences; the business unit to which the resource
belongs; a summary of projects worked on; and so forth are maintained in a searchable database.
Utilization (amount of time a resource is used on projects) is tracked on at least a weekly basis.
Resource availability (amount of time each resource is idle or is available for client projects) is also
tracked and published to a large group of managers to keep in mind for upcoming assignments.
A central resource manager is responsible for tracking and managing resource utilization. If any
member of the management team has an open requirement, the resource manager is first notified of
the requirement, so that work can begin on tracking the right person for the role. Resource
managers from each business unit meet regularly to discuss staff availability and open positions.
Weekly meetings are held with senior management teams to understand the open staffing
requirements. As a first fit, internal available resources are aligned (based on the skills required,
time frame of the project, and whether the role aligns with a person’s career preferences) with
open positions. Since Atos-Origin is a global organization, this helps the company to increase
utilization of the individual resource and of the group as a whole. If existing resources are not avail-
able or do not fit into the assignment, a requisition to hire new resources is completed, and the job
is posted for recruitment.
Atos-Origin considers three different type of external hires: full-time employees (the preferred
option), hourly employees (work on an hourly basis; the option used when the project is for a short
period of time or when the right resource does not want to accept a full-time offer), and subcon-
tractors (contracting with other companies; the option used sometimes to mitigate resource risks).
The new resource who is hired is on-boarded to the company in a structured fashion, and the
same process for managing the person’s utilization and availability is followed. This structured
process has helped reduce attrition, increased internal transfer of resources, helped individual
resource growth, and increased the company’s profitability.

developing and using some of the project management tools that are described through-
out this book. For example, when a team works together to create a good charter, they
rapidly work through the project forming stage and often begin to develop the openness,
understanding, and trust that help make their storming stage faster and easier. Informa-
tion regarding the issues, behaviors, and strategies associated with each stage is displayed
in Exhibit 13.3.
Understanding the stages of development that project teams typically progress
through is a basis for project goal attainment and project team development. For
example, if a project manager of a new team wants to help his or her team progress
through the stages without too much trouble, he or she can look at the top and
bottom rows of Exhibit 13.3. New members often feel a combination of excitement about
being picked for the new team and concern that the work may be difficult. The project
manager can help the new team develop team operating methods early—when they
construct the project charter. Having the team decide how they will work together
helps establish workable methods and simultaneously helps the team members

start to know and trust each other. Once the initial forming is over, it is common
for teams to “storm”—that is, to feel more stress as they begin to understand how
big and difficult the project appears upon closer scrutiny. Some of the team mem-
bers may want to perform the project, yet may resist committing fully. A project
manager may work with the team to help ensure that everyone understands and
accepts their respective roles. Further, when each team member understands the
other members’ roles, they can see how the project will be accomplished. The proj-
ect manager can continue to encourage all team members to actively participate
and to refine the team operating methods into ground rules if necessary. Once a
project team weathers the storming period, the members often are relieved because
they start to believe they will be successful. Continued team building can help a
team to refine its ability to perform. As team members are encouraged to collabo-
rate and build capability, the team moves to a higher level, which is often called
the performing stage. Not every team reaches this level. However, it is very satisfy-
ing for the teams that do and is a wonderful situation for capturing learnings to
help improve other project teams. Finally, project teams disband when the project
is over. If the project has been successful, team members often feel both excited
about facing new challenges and sad about leaving a satisfying experience and
good friends. Project managers should use celebration, rewards, and appropriate
follow-on work to guide the team through this last stretch.
13-2b Characteristics of High-Performing Project Teams
Once a project manager understands the typical stages of team development, it is time to
understand the characteristics of high-performing project teams. These characteristics,
which are an elaborate expansion of the performing column in Exhibit 13.3, reflect the
ideals toward which a project manager tries to guide his or her team. This chain of high-
performing project team characteristics is shown in Exhibit 13.4. Remember, this is the
ideal. Many project teams perform well and exhibit some, but not all, of these character-
istics. Nevertheless, a conscientious project manager keeps these characteristics in mind
and strives to help his team develop each one.
The characteristics of high-performing project teams start with the personal values of
individual team members. While a project manager can and should strive to improve

upon these values, it is far easier if team members are recruited with a good start on the
following values:
•
High need for achievement
•
Understanding and acceptance of personal responsibility
•
Commitment to self-development and self-directed behavior
•
Ability to put project needs before their own needs within reason
•
Willingness to consider alternative views and to change
•
Personal commitment to the project
The personal values can be enhanced by utilizing the following effective team
behavior methods:
•
Team members are selected to have the right skill mix.
•
Team members help each other.
•
Team members demonstrate a constant focus on improvement.
•
Team members use effective time and meeting management.
•
Team members strive for innovation with a minimum of formal procedures.
•
Team members capture, share, and use lessons learned.
The personal values can be further improved by practicing the following beneficial
communications methods:
•
Information is freely and widely shared within and beyond the team.
•
All important topics are openly discussed.
•
Conflict over approaches is valued, but personal conflict is discouraged.
•
Potential problems are proactively reported.
•
Teams conduct frequent debriefings and reflect to collectively learn.
•
Barriers to communication are overcome.
Project managers can certainly use some of the following project management
methods to further the team development:
•
Agree on common goals and objectives for the project.
•
Jointly plan the project.
•
Use the charter to guide joint decision making.
•
Work together to accomplish activities.
•
Proactively identify and solve problems.
•
Hold each other mutually accountable with individualized feedback.
Using effective team, communications, and project management methods leads to
development of the following appropriate feelings that team members can begin to hold
toward one another:
•
Recognizing how interdependent they are
•
Being flexible on how each contributes to the project
•
Being willing to share risks with teammates
•
Understanding, appreciating, liking, and trusting each other
•
Sharing in strong project leadership
This chain leads to two favorable outcomes. The first set of outcomes is personal
rewards that each team member is likely to receive such as the following:
•
Enjoyment of their work
•
High spirit and team morale
354
Part 3 Performing Projects

•
Pride in being part of the team
•
Satisfaction in project accomplishments
The other set of favorable outcomes is the following strong project results:
•
Persevering despite challenges
•
Producing high-quality results
•
Consistently meeting or exceeding stakeholder expectations.5
In addition to these characteristics, agile teams are often described as being self-
managed, focused on project goals, strong communicators, able to decide quickly, more
responsible, and willing to trust their instincts once they understand their sponsor. The
result is that these team members are more satisfied and flexible and less confrontational.
13-2c Assessing Individual Member Capability
Great team synergy can help a team’s capability be better than the individual members’
capabilities. Likewise, poor team synergy can produce a team with less capability than
the individuals on the team would suggest. However, more often, individual team mem-
bers with high capability can be effectively developed into a strong team. So, what capa-
bilities should project team members possess? Five types of useful project team member
capabilities are as follows:
1. Activity-specific knowledge and skills
2. Personal planning and control
3. Personal learning
4. Organizational understanding
5. Interpersonal skills and sensitivity
The first type is activity-specific capability. If a team member is responsible for a
specific function such as managing the construction of a stone wall, he or she should
understand in detail what needs to be accomplished to create a desirable stone wall. If
she personally builds the wall, she also needs the skills to do so. A second desirable
capability is personal planning and control such as setting personal goals, accomplishing
work as planned, and time management. Third, project team members should desire to
continually improve and invest effort in their personal improvement.
These first three capabilities are necessary for a person to be a strong individual per-
former. However, the last two capabilities really help a person become a valuable team
player. While all five are useful, if a project manager wants to develop a strong project
team, the last two capabilities may be more important. Too many teams have not achieved
the expected success because team members were content to just be individual performers.
The fourth useful capability is understanding the organizational structure, culture, and
roles, and using that knowledge to help the project manager get things done. This involves
knowing the informal methods and networks within the parent organization. If the project is
being performed for a client, it can also include knowing how things work within the client’s
organization. The last useful team member capability is interpersonal skills and sensitivity.
This includes skills such as active listening, effective speaking, and conflict management. It
also includes sensitivity to others who have different personalities or backgrounds.
13-2d Assessing Project Team Capability
When assessing project team capability, the project manager should remember that his
or her responsibilities are to simultaneously support the parent organization, the project,
and the project team. These three are intertwined in many ways. While much has been
written concerning teams, Exhibit 13.5 summarizes the success factors of project teams.

Note the related chapter number and specific topic where this book gives guidance
to help achieve each success factor. Many practices of good project management
(and good organizational management practices) help a project team to excel, just
as many team success factors help a project team deliver good project and organi-
zational results.
For example, the project charter covered in Chapter 4 is helpful in achieving many of
the project team success factors. The entire project charter is a basis for more detailed
project planning and for understanding project objectives. Working together to develop,
sign, and distribute the charter greatly aids in communications and commitment.
Specific sections of the charter also help teams develop successfully. The team operating
methods section helps guide team member behaviors as they resolve conflicts, the ap-
plied learnings help create a stimulating work environment, and the acceptance criteria
help team members understand when they satisfy project stakeholders.
Following is a brief description of why each project team success factor listed in
Exhibit 13.5 is useful.
1. Project teams with strong leadership are more likely to be successful. Leadership can
occur at every level within a project team. Each member performs better by
understanding both his or her own role and those of all of the other executives, man-
agers, and associates that are part of the team. Part of project team leadership is the
project culture nurtured by the sponsor and project manager.
2. Effective team leadership can lead to mutual trust, respect, and credibility among all
parties.
3. This, in turn, can lead to the cross-functional cooperation and support that helps
guide a project through turbulent situations.
4–5. Project managers have many project tools to guide a team—charters, stakeholder
analysis, communications plans, scope statements, WBSs, schedules, and kickoff
meetings. Collectively done well, they help to create clarity and active support for
the project. It is difficult to overestimate the impact that effective communication
has on project teams. When people are not told something, they must guess. Proactive
project managers realize that planning and executing effective two-way communica-
tions is a major key to their teams’ success.
6–8. The next three project team success factors—skills, objectives, and behaviors—apply spe-
cifically to the team. Assembling the right quantity and variety of skills and experience for
the project team can be quite challenging. This is especially true in the current work en-
vironment of careful cost control. One method that project managers can use is to staff
the project with a combination of experienced and less-experienced members. It often
costs less to use an inexperienced person. An expectation can be set for the more experi-
enced person to help mentor the junior person. This helps with organizational learning as
well as achieving the project’s goals in a less costly manner. Many project teams include a
section in their charter on team operating methods. This section often spells out methods
of decision making, meeting management, and demonstrating respect. While working
through this, an astute project manager may notice which team members help accom-
plish project meeting tasks and which help with team relationships. Both are necessary,
and if either is lacking, the project manager may want to either help develop or recruit to
ensure that those needs are met.
9-10. When the first eight project team success factors are being adequately met, the last
two are often results. These last two—stimulating work and opportunity for recog-
nition—have shown the strongest correlation to successful project performance as
perceived by senior managers.6 People work hard and enthusiastically if they find
Chapter 13 Leading and Managing Project Teams
357

their work stimulating and believe they will be rewarded for it. Appropriate and
sincere recognition can often be at least as powerful a motivation as monetary
rewards. Project managers can use their creativity to reward all who are worthy.
All 10 of these project team success factors can be influenced by a project manager
guiding his or her team through the various topics shown. Many of the success factors
require some early work, such as the project charter, and some continuing work as the
project progresses. A new project manager can ask questions to determine to what extent
his project team currently displays each of these success factors. Then he will be ready to
build the team’s capacity upon this base.
13-2e Building Individual and Project Team Capability
Project managers have many tools at their disposal for developing individuals and teams.
Many of the methods can be used together and reinforce each other. Seven methods that
many project managers find useful are as follows:
1. Demonstrate personal leadership.
2. Utilize project management tools.
3. Demand situational leadership.
4. Create a desirable team identity.
5. Teach personal responsibility.
6. Develop understanding and respect.
7. Use a learning cycle.
PERSONAL LEADERSHIP A good way for project managers to build the capability of
their team is to start by being an effective leader. Leading by example gives team mem-
bers a model to follow. A project manager leads by balancing the demands of the parent
organization, the project, and the team members. In this context, the project manager is
a team member—but one who treats both herself and all of the other team members in a
respectful manner. The project manager must use the highest levels of honesty and
ethics. This includes never stating something that is false, but also not giving a false
impression. This can cause a bit of extra work or conflict in the short term, but it is
the only appropriate behavior and pays great dividends in the long run by encouraging
(and even demanding) everyone else to do what is right.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOLS Project managers can use project management tools
to give their team focus. For example, the charter gets a team started quickly. The WBS,
schedule, and other project management tools each help to focus the team in specific
ways. Teams need to work toward specific goals.
SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP Depending on the team’s initial capability, a project
manager may need to start as a strong individual leader, but the goal is certainly to
develop multiple leaders on the project team. In fact, in a great project team, leadership
is situational. That is, each member may have both a leadership role in certain circum-
stances and followership roles in other situations. Where a junior team member has spe-
cific knowledge, he or she should ensure that everyone understands the situation. Even a
junior team member is often expected to lead in certain situations.
DESIRABLE TEAM IDENTITY Another way to build team capacity is to create a desir-
able team identity. Frequently, the project manager and sponsor start thinking about this
even before they recruit the first team members. People want to be associated with a
winner. If people believe that a project is vital to the organization and that the work is
358
Part 3 Performing Projects

professionally stimulating, they want to be part of the team. Depending on the organiza-
tion, some teams give detailed thought to the project name and “brand.”
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Project team members need to understand they all have
three responsibilities. The first is to complete their individual work on time, on budget,
and correctly. Second is to complete their joint work responsibilities with teammates on
time, on budget, and correctly. Third, each team member is also responsible for improv-
ing work methods. Each needs to improve his or her personal work and to work with the
team to jointly improve the project team’s capabilities.
UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT Project team members need to develop under-
standing of and trust in each other if they want to develop capability as a team. Under-
standing others starts with understanding oneself. A self-aware individual is more
effective in establishing relationships by better appreciating and valuing the contributions
of others and being willing to learn from them. One method of understanding both one-
self and others better is to use StrengthsFinder and to realize how each individual
strength can be productively applied on projects, as shown on the student website. As
team members understand one another and develop interdependence, they are naturally
more able to understand and develop interdependence beyond the project team. Since
most projects have multiple stakeholders, this ability to connect at many levels and man-
ners is vital to team development.
LEARNING CYCLE Building project team capability can be envisioned as a learning
cycle in which the team uses creativity to jointly develop and consider alternative
approaches while striving to learn at each point in the process. This learning cycle can
be easily understood using the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) model already introduced in
Chapters 5 and 11. The project team capability building cycle is shown in Exhibit 13.6.
Project team capacity building is performed in the context of planning and executing
project work. Project teams can repeatedly pass through this capability-building cycle as

359

they progressively learn how to work better to-
gether to reach their project goals. Free and
open communications along with a willingness
to challenge each other are important because
the project team may need to unlearn or give
up past behaviors in favor of new approaches
that might be more effective.
In the “plan” step, project teams are chal-
lenged with using lessons learned from previous
projects to drive their improvement efforts.
These lessons need to be compared to the
emerging requirements for the project that the
team learns from methods such as gathering re-
quirements, meeting with customers, brain-
storming risks, and holding design reviews.
In the “do” step, the project team then uses
this knowledge to develop shared meaning and
potential approaches that they may use. The
team uncovers assumptions, brainstorms alter-
native approaches, and often develops rolling wave plans so the results of early work
will give the information needed to create good plans for later work.
In the “check” step, the project team evaluates the potential approaches and selects
one. They can use techniques such as piloting new technology, creating a subject matter
expert panel to make recommendations, conducting feasibility studies, and reviewing the
problem with key stakeholders to obtain a clear decision.
In the “act” step, the project team finishes the planning, carries it out, and gathers
data regarding it. Simultaneously, they seek acceptance beyond their team through artic-
ulating the project’s business case, involving key stakeholders, proactively communicat-
ing according to plans, and not acting until enough support is in place.
The cycle then repeats. Project teams that are serious about improving their
capability repeat this cycle quickly within project stages, at key milestones, and
from project to project. The improved capacity of one project team can be shared
with other projects through lessons learned and sharing core team members and
SMEs with other projects.
13-2f Establishing Project Team Ground Rules
Project teams often create a brief set of operating principles in their charter as described
in Chapter 4. For small teams performing simple projects, these principles are enough to
guide their behavior. This is especially true if the company has a track record of success
with teams. However, many managers understand that more specific project team
ground rules can help prevent many potential problems that some teams encounter.
Ground rules are acceptable behaviors adopted by a project team to improve working
relationships, effectiveness, and communication. Therefore, many times the simple set
of operating principles is expanded into a broader set of ground rules.
Exhibit 13.7 lists a dozen of the most frequent topics that project teams choose to create
ground rules to cover. Note the topics are classified as either dealing primarily with process
issues or primarily with relationship issues. Note also that there is more than one way to
implement each ground rule. Also listed in Exhibit 13.7 are two strengths from the student
website that might be used in very different ways to accomplish each ground rule—and other
strengths could be applied as well—each in its own unique manner.

RELATIONSHIP TOPICS The relationship topics both help the team make better
decisions and help project team members feel valued. People who feel valued often
work with much more enthusiasm and commitment.
Encourage Participation
The first relationship topic is to encourage balanced partici-
pation. This balance can include drawing out a quiet person and asking a talkative
person to let another individual speak. Balance can mean ensuring that all functions are
given the opportunity to provide input. Balanced participation can also mean sharing
leadership roles. The project manager certainly needs to be a leader, but each project
team member can provide leadership in certain situations.
Discuss Openly and Protect Confidentiality
The second relationship topic is to
encourage open discussion. When some topics are off limits for discussion, sometimes
important issues are not raised, and poor decisions are made. Closely related to open
discussion is protecting confidentiality. People need to be able to trust that a sensitive
issue will not be repeated outside of the project team. It is hard to work effectively
together if team members are concerned that when important issues are raised, they
will be shared inappropriately.
Avoid Misunderstandings
Since projects are often staffed by people from different
functions and even different companies, there is a strong potential for misunderstand-
ings. Both the person stating something and the person listening have a responsibility
to head off potential misunderstandings. Many active listening techniques are useful for
this, such as repeating in your own words what was said or asking for an example.
Develop Trust
The fifth relationship topic is to develop trust. Each project team mem-
ber has two responsibilities with regard to establishing trust. First, each needs to person-
ally always be worthy of the trust of his or her teammates. This means accomplishing

work as promised and always being completely truthful. Part of being truthful may be
admitting in advance a concern about being able to do certain work—because of ability,
knowledge, or time constraints. The second responsibility is to trust his or her team-
mates unless and until one proves unworthy of trust. Many people live up to or down
to the expectations others have for them. By practicing the highest ethical standards
and expecting team members to do so as well, most team members demonstrate their
trustworthiness. Note that this does not mean naively trusting that an inexperienced per-
son can independently figure out how to perform a complex task Common sense must
still be used with the choice of work assignments and the level of help that is given to
each person.
Handle Conflict
The final relationship ground rule topic is how to handle conflict.
Conflict over which approach is best can be useful because it may bring out creative
discussion and lead to better methods. However, conflict that becomes personal can be
destructive. Therefore, conflict over ideas is often encouraged (up to a point), while
personal conflict is often settled by the individuals off the project. The project manager
may get involved and/or may bring in a neutral third party if necessary. Conflict man-
agement is covered later in this chapter.
PROCESS TOPICS Process topics include how a project team works together as they
gather data, meet, and make important project decisions.
Manage Meetings
The process topic regarding meeting management is introduced in
Chapter 5 in the context of improving and documenting meetings. Special applications
of meeting management are covered in Chapter 11 for kickoff meetings and Chapter 14
for progress reporting meetings.
Establish Roles
The second process topic is to establish roles. People are usually as-
signed to a project team in the role of project manager, core team member, or subject
matter expert. Within the team, however, it is often helpful to assign roles regarding
items such as who plans a particular meeting, who watches the time, and who records
the minutes. One important principle with roles is to try to help everyone feel valued.
A person who is constantly assigned unpleasant tasks may not feel as important or as
motivated to contribute. Another part of assigning roles is to assign most project team
members work to do between most meetings. Each worker is then responsible for
completing their assignments—although a wise project manager often informally checks
up on team members.
Maintain Focus
Projects are often under terrific pressure to be completed quickly.
Therefore, project managers need to consider the third process topic, which is to ensure
that the team stays focused. One way to do this is to bring out the charter when people
are arguing over a decision. The charter can remind the team what they are really trying
to accomplish and why. Another means of maintaining focus is to return to the stake-
holder analysis and the tradeoff decisions that the key stakeholders have indicated. The
key with focus is to spend the most time and energy on important issues and to delegate,
postpone, or ignore less important issues.
Consider Alternatives
The fourth process-oriented ground rule topic is to always con-
sider at least two alternative approaches before proceeding. It is amazing how many proj-
ect teams simply agree with the first suggestion that someone makes. A team that invests
as little as a couple of minutes of time can ensure that they have considered alternative
approaches. Quite often, a much better idea emerges from a second or third suggestion
than from the first one. Also, many times a project team decides to combine the better
362
Part 3 Performing Projects

parts of two approaches. This consideration of alternatives not only often yields a better
approach, but it also often results in better commitment because more people’s ideas
were considered. For example, in a project to install a suite of equipment at a customer’s
site, a final site investigation revealed that a major piece of equipment was not func-
tional. One answer was to expedite the shipment of a duplicate piece of equipment, while
a competing alternative was to use overtime labor and consultants to refurbish the onsite
equipment. Both alternatives were expensive, and neither looked very promising. How-
ever, upon further discussion, it was determined that one section of the equipment was
the primary concern, so a new section could be air-freighted in and the workers onsite
could install it. This hybrid alternative proved to be far less expensive and more practical
than either alternative that the panicked team first considered.
Use Data
The fifth process-oriented ground rule topic is to always use data when
possible. Gather the facts instead of arguing over opinions. In meetings, make the data
visible to everyone on the team so that all can use it to help make informed decisions.
Many of the quality tools listed in Exhibit 11.13 help the project team to gather,
organize, prioritize, and analyze data for making informed decisions.
Make Decisions
The final process-related topic is decision making. Project decisions
can be made in several different ways. Adherence to the other ground rule topics will
help regardless of which decision-making method is chosen. Methods that project teams
often use to make decisions include the following:
•
The project manager or sponsor makes the decision.
•
One or two team members make the decision.
•
The project team uses consensus to make the decision.
•
The project team votes to make the decision.
On some issues, the project sponsor or project manager retains the right to make a
decision. Sometimes, this is because a decision needs to be made quickly or it takes
higher authority. A sponsor or project manager may also ask for input from the team
and then make the decision. While this is often a good idea, that person should be very
careful to tell the team up front that he or she still intends to make the decision. Other-
wise, the team members who provided input may feel that their ideas were not
considered.
Project managers may choose to delegate a decision to one or two team members—
either members of the core team or SMEs. This strategy works well when not enough
information or time is available at the current meeting and the decision needs to be
made before the following meeting. Decisions that primarily impact one or two members
rather than the entire project team are ripe for delegation. Delegating to two team mem-
bers has the secondary benefit of their getting to know each other better and working
together. A variation on this delegation strategy is to ask the one or two team members
to investigate and recommend a solution so the team can make a decision at the next
meeting. Over the course of a project, most team members will probably get the chance
to make certain decisions.
Consensus is a wonderful, but time-consuming, technique. True consensus means each
person actively supports the decisions—even if it is not his or her first choice. The team
tells stakeholders that after discussion they understand the decision that was made is the
best one for the project. To reach this true consensus, each person needs to be able to
articulate what he or she believes is important in the decision and why. Creative approaches
may need to be developed when none of the original ideas pleases everyone. Consensus is
helpful when significant commitment is necessary to implement the decision.
Chapter 13 Leading and Managing Project Teams
363

One final method that project teams might use to make decisions is to vote. This is
often a poor choice since the losers of the vote may not be very enthusiastic. One of the
other methods may be better. Voting can be useful, however, when it is a straw vote—
that is, to test for agreement, a team may take a nonbinding vote. If most of the team
agrees, then it may not take long to drive toward consensus. If many members do not
agree, then delaying the decision, gathering more data, or agreeing to let one person
make the decision may be in order.
13-3 Manage Project Team
Manage project team is “the process of tracking team member performance, providing
feedback, resolving issues, and coordinating changes to optimize project performance.”7
When managing the project team, a project manager uses various forms of power to get
team members to prioritize and commit to project work. Project managers are often called
upon to either assess members’ performance or to at least provide input for the performance
assessments. A variety of outputs are created by managing the project team.
13-3a Project Manager Power and Leadership
Since project managers often rely on people who do not report directly to them to
perform some of the project work, they need to use various forms of power to
encourage people to perform. Types of power available to project managers are
shown in Exhibit 13.8.

Part 3 Performing Projects

LEGITIMATE POWER Project managers often do not have the authority to tell subordi-
nates what to do. Therefore, project managers often have less legitimate power than other
managers. However, to the extent that project managers can ask team members to perform
certain activities, they should do so. In contemporary project management, a project manager
often has a core team to help plan and manage some of the project. These core team mem-
bers are probably the people the project manager can order to perform certain activities, but
he or she would be better served when possible to ask them to help plan the activities. The old
axiom is true: People tend to support the things they helped to create.
REWARD AND COERCIVE POWER Reward and coercive power are opposites of each
other. Rewards do not all need to cost money. In fact, stimulating work is one of the
most powerful rewards. Enticing people to perform well so they can be assigned to
more interesting and/or challenging work in the future helps the team member, the
immediate project, and the organization by increasing competence. While reward power
is the preferred method, there are times when a person is not performing and a threat
may be necessary. This is especially true if most members of the project team are per-
forming and one or two members are not. People who work hard value teammates who
also work hard and are often upset when some members do not do their share.
REFERENT POWER Referent power is when a project team member works for the proj-
ect manager out of personal desire. Project managers sow the seeds for referent power
when interviewing candidates for their project team. If the project manager takes the
time to understand the personal motives of each worker, he or she can create desirable
opportunities for each. Individual project managers who remember the adage “no one
loves your project as much as you do” use their referent power by continuing to describe
their project’s purpose in ways that appeal to each individual worker’s desires. Many suc-
cessful project managers work hard to develop both friendships and respect with their
team members. Loyalty must go both ways. If a team member believes a project manager
has his best interests at heart and will advocate for him, then he is more likely to work
hard for the project manager.
EXPERT POWER Generally, people want to succeed in whatever they do. Project
managers can tap into this desire by using expert power. If a project manager has
a reputation for success and can convince others that he or she understands enough
of the project technology and politics to successfully guide the project, people will
be more inclined to work hard on the project. They will be convinced that their
efforts will pay off.
INFORMATION POWER Information power is something that project managers want
to use, but not in a coercive manner. While information is power, withholding or
distorting information is unethical. A project manager’s responsibility is to ensure that
whoever needs certain information receives it in a timely manner, in a form they can
understand, and with complete honesty. That does not mean sharing confidential infor-
mation inappropriately. It does mean empowering the core team to distribute informa-
tion promptly and accurately according to the communication plan. This gives the core
team more power.
CONNECTION POWER The very reason for having executives sponsor projects is
because the sponsor frequently has more legitimate power than the project manager. Proj-
ect managers can use the power of the sponsor when necessary. A project manager
who frequently asks the sponsor to intervene looks weak. On the other hand, a project
manager who does not ask for the sponsor’s help when it is really needed lacks judgment.
Chapter 13 Leading and Managing Project Teams
365

Project managers can create many champions for their project by continuing to expand
their contacts with important people and by continuing to talk about the importance of
their project.
13-3b Assessing Performance of Individuals and Project Teams
The second aspect of managing project teams is assessing the performance of both indi-
viduals and the project team. Goals of performance assessments include administrative
uses such as rewards and promotions and developmental uses such as determining areas
for improvement. In many organizations, a large percentage of people dread perfor-
mance assessments. Many people do not enjoy giving honest feedback—particularly
about shortcomings. Also, many people do not like to receive constructive feedback.
However, to both reward and improve performance, honest assessments are needed.
Performance assessment can be both informal and formal. Project managers often
perform informal assessments by observing, asking questions, and providing suggestions.
This improves performance if it is done regularly, as timely and specific feedback is most
effective.
Formal performance assessments are often the primary responsibility of the direct man-
ager. In many organizations, this is a functional manager. However, because many project
team members spend significant time on a project, the project manager is often asked to
provide input for the formal performance assessment. The ideal situation for this input is
when the team member helped participate in the project planning and is judged by how
his or her work corresponds to the planned work. Many project team members may work
on several projects during the course of the formal assessment period. When that is the case,
the projects where they spent the greatest time would ideally count the most toward their
performance rating. On some large projects, a project manager may seek input from other
team members regarding the team member’s performance.
13-3c Project Team Management Outcomes
A variety of outcomes may result from managing the project team, such as the following:
•
Morale changes
•
“Quarter-mile stones” to “inch stones”
•
Staff changes
•
Training needs
•
Discipline
•
Role clarification
•
Issues
•
Lessons learned
MORALE CHANGES Many projects have periods that are difficult, when work demands
are high and milestones to celebrate are few. At these times, the project manager needs
to remember that how he or she wields power, communicates, appraises progress, and
generally manages can enhance or detract from the morale of all involved. Continuing
to reinforce the project’s purpose, encouraging and supporting workers, and trying hard
to understand their concerns can go a long way to boosting morale.
“QUARTER-MILE STONES” TO “INCH STONES” When constructing the project
charter, the team developed a list of milestones that could be used to measure progress.
On some projects, that is enough detail against which performance can be measured. On
other projects, however, more detail is needed. Perhaps this greater detail could be
considered as “quarter-mile stones”—giving the ability to check progress a bit more
366
Part 3 Performing Projects

frequently. When assessing the performance of individual workers, if one individual
worker consistently does not perform well, the project manager may decide that more
detailed oversight is necessary. This could result in “yard, foot, or inch stones,” depend-
ing on the level of oversight deemed necessary. Hopefully, for most projects and most
workers, this additional oversight is not necessary. It takes time and effort that could be
spent on other things. However, a wise project manager is not going to let a project get
derailed because of one worker who is not performing well.
STAFF CHANGES As a result of poor appraisals, insufficient progress, conflict, neces-
sary reassignments, or other causes, some staff may need to be changed on a project.
When this occurs, wise project managers treat everyone with respect and recognize that
the changes are happening. When new people are added, they are on-boarded with
project information and introductions.
TRAINING NEEDS In the course of appraisals, training needs are sometimes discov-
ered. Project managers should keep the immediate project needs along with the training
needs in mind as they approve training.
DISCIPLINE Performance on some projects is so poor that workers need to be disci-
plined. While coercive power is often considered a last resort, it should be used at times.
Project managers must ensure that the need for the discipline is explained clearly,
specific behaviors or lack of progress are documented, and specific improvement strate-
gies are developed to reduce the chance that further discipline will be needed.
ROLE CLARIFICATION Sometimes, progress may be lacking because of misunderstand-
ings in responsibilities. In those cases, the project manager and all impacted workers can
clarify roles by detailing who is responsible for each work activity.
ISSUES AND LESSONS LEARNED Many project managers keep issue logs. These
serve as living documents of issues that arise in the course of managing the project
team. As issues are raised, they are added to the log. As they are resolved, they are
deleted. The resolved issues sometimes make good lessons learned if they can help future
project teams avoid problems. These lessons can be documented and stored for easy
retrieval in a lessons-learned knowledge base.
13-4 Manage and Control Stakeholder Engagement
Manage stakeholder engagement is “the process of communicating and working with
stakeholders to meet their needs/expectations, address issues as they occur, and foster
appropriate stakeholder engagement in project activities throughout the project life
cycle.”8 This process can be visualized as shown in Exhibit 13.9 with managing on the
left and controlling on the right.
The first part of managing stakeholder engagement—understanding stakeholder
assumptions—was performed while creating the charter (Chapter 4), stakeholder register
(Chapter 5), and requirements matrix (Chapter 6). Different stakeholders may hold very
different assumptions concerning the project at the outset, and these assumptions form
the basis of their expectations. Therefore, the project manager clarifies the assumptions,
challenges and negotiates some of them, and uses them in project planning.
These clarified assumptions are then stated as expectations regarding project deliverables,
features of the product, timelines, costs, quality measures, and generally how the project man-
ager and team will act. The stakeholders then have a chance to agree or challenge the expec-
tations before committing to them. The expectations are then documented.
Chapter 13 Leading and Managing Project Teams
367

During project execution, the team works toward satisfying the expectations. This
achievement is composed of work between project meetings to complete assigned activities
and to quickly resolve problems that have surfaced. Concurrent with the achievement of
expectations is the continual recommitment to the expectations. One method that project
teams can use to reconfirm expectations is to share planning documents, such as schedules,
with stakeholders. The team tells the stakeholders that this is their understanding of what
they have been asked to do. It is what they expect to achieve and be judged against. Some
stakeholders may identify further expectations when they see everything spelled out. Project
managers often hold informal conversations with various stakeholders to ensure that they
fully understand and agree with all of the planning details. Finally, as project teams report
progress to stakeholders, additional expectations emerge. When additional expectations
emerge, they need to be considered in terms of the project’s formal change control process
and, if accepted, become additional project activities to be performed. All of these activities
used to manage engagement increase support from those stakeholders who are for the
project and decrease resistance from others.
Control stakeholder engagement is “the process of monitoring overall project stake-
holder relationships and adjusting strategies and plans for engaging stakeholders.”9 The
vertical box on the right in Exhibit 13.9 shows three things a project manager must mon-
itor throughout the process of managing stakeholder expectations: relationships, commu-
nications, and lessons learned. The project manager and project team must build trust
with all project stakeholders through honest and ethical behavior. They need to continu-
ally manage effective two-way communications with all stakeholders as described in the
communications plan. This includes a true willingness to have stakeholders ask probing
questions, because that is an effective way for some stakeholders to develop confidence in
the project manager. Finally, they should use lessons learned from previous projects and
previous phases of the current project. Armed with trusting relationships, effective com-
munications, and methods that overcome some problems from previous projects, the
team is prepared to adjust strategies and plans as needed to control stakeholder
engagement.

Part 3 Performing Projects

On agile projects, stakeholders need to be educated about their roles; alerted in
advance concerning changes; and asked for early and continuous feedback. These are
all excellent methods to use on any project.
13-5 Managing Project Conflicts
Projects create unique outputs, have diverse stakeholders, often have team members
from various functions and even different companies, and frequently operate in a matrix
environment. All of these factors, along with time pressure, contribute to potential
conflicts. Many project management initiating and planning tools exist at least partly to
reduce destructive aspects of conflict. There are various ways to view conflict, along with
various styles and approaches for dealing with it. This section also introduces a project
conflict resolution process model.
Project charters are meant to help the project core team, project manager, and spon-
sor understand many aspects of the project at a high level and head off potential conflict
between those individuals. Several components included in charters such as assumptions,
risks, roles, responsibilities, and acceptance criteria are examples of potential sources of
conflict. Stakeholder analysis and communications planning can identify needs and
desires of many others who will be impacted by either the process of performing the
project or a deliverable of the project. These tools help to identify and deal with potential
sources of conflict among the broader stakeholders. The more detailed planning tools
such as the WBS, schedule, and budget help to identify other conflict sources.
13-5a Sources of Project Conflict
Some conflict on projects is useful; other conflict is destructive. Conflict over ideas on
how to proceed with a project can lead to more creative approaches. Conflict over how
to complete a project with a tight schedule can also be positive. Competition for ideas on
how to best handle a project activity has the potential for generating more innovative
and successful approaches and can be highly stimulating work. However, when conflict
becomes personal, it can often become negative. These types of conflict need to be
handled with care. A few typical sources of project conflict are shown in Exhibit 13.10.
Generally, it is better to deal with conflict on projects promptly—or even proactively.
Conflicts do not get better with time! This is especially true for projects with significant
pressure to stay on schedule or on budget (in other words, many projects).
Virtually all studies determine that relationship conflict can be detrimental to project
team success. When people spend time and emotional energy arguing, they have less

energy to work on the project. Also, when people have personal conflicts to the point
where they really do not like each other, they often feel less committed to the project
and to their team.
Task conflict is a bit more complicated. A certain amount of task conflict can encour-
age people to consider alternative approaches and to better justify decisions. Up to that
point, task conflict can be useful. However, beyond a certain point, when people spend a
great deal of time arguing over task-type issues, it still takes away from the project team’s
progress and camaraderie. The timing of task conflict can also make a difference on
whether it helps or hurts the project. The best times to discuss different options are dur-
ing the initiating stage, when high-level approaches are being decided, and during the
planning stage, when more detailed decisions are being made. However, once the plans
are made, a project team needs to be a bit more careful because prolonged discussions
during the executing periods of the project can lead to schedule slippage and cost
overruns.
13-5b Conflict Resolution Process and Styles
Once a project manager realizes a conflict exists, if it is a task conflict, he or she tries to
utilize it to develop a better solution. If it is a relationship conflict, he or she tries to
resolve it before it escalates. A project manager can use the six-step project conflict reso-
lution process, making sure to pay attention both to the tasks and relationships needed
at each step.
Six-Step Project Conflict Resolution Process
1. Understand the conflict.
2. Agree on conflict resolution goals.
3. Identify causes of the conflict.
4. Identify potential solutions for the conflict.
5. Pick the desired conflict solution.
6. Implement the chosen solution.
First, what are the signs of the conflict? Is it specific to a certain stage in the project?
Does each party in the conflict understand it the same way? If not, ask clarifying ques-
tions, summarize how the other person has stated the problem, and confirm that you
have a common understanding.
Next, ensure that all parties agree on what a successful conflict resolution would be.
While there are often conflicting goals on projects, all stakeholders typically want useful
deliverables on time and on budget. Use the project goals as a basis for what the solution
needs to cover.
Many conflicts have multiple causes, such as those shown in Exhibit 13.10. Identify
potential causes and then verify which cause(s) are actually contributing to the conflict.
The next step is to identify potential solutions to the conflict. This is clearly a time
where creativity and trust are helpful.
The fifth step is deciding how to resolve the conflict. There are five general styles for
resolving project conflict, as depicted in Exhibit 13.11.
The collaborative style is preferred for important decisions that require both parties to
actively support the final decision. However, collaboration requires both parties to
develop trust in each other and frequently takes longer than the other styles. Therefore,
each style has its place in dealing with project conflicts.
The final step is to implement the chosen solution. For a major conflict, this could be
almost like a mini-project plan with activities identified and responsibility assigned. It is
vital to include communication of the solution to all concerned parties.

Part 3 Performing Projects

13-5c Negotiation
Project managers are generally held accountable for more performance than they have
responsibility to direct people to perform. Because of this, project managers must negoti-
ate. As stated earlier in this chapter, they often need to negotiate with functional man-
agers for the particular people they wish to have work on the project. Project managers
often need to negotiate with customers concerning schedule, budget, scope, and a myriad
of details. They often need to negotiate with sponsors, suppliers, SMEs, and core team
members.
Nobody loves a project as much as the project manager does. However, a project
manager must remember that negotiations will be smoother if she realizes that everyone
she negotiates with has their own set of issues and goals.
Many of the project management tools discussed thus far in this book, such as char-
ters, stakeholder analysis, communication plans, schedules, budgets, and change control,
make negotiations easier. Several of the soft skills discussed in this book, such as involv-
ing your team in planning, treating everyone with respect, keeping communications
open, and establishing trust, also simplify negotiations. The issues project managers
need to negotiate can greatly vary in size and complexity. For example, many very small
issues can involve day-to-day scheduling issues. On the other hand, the entire set of
project deliverables with accompanying schedule and budget are often negotiated.
Regardless of the negotiation size or complexity, the six-step process shown in
Exhibit 13.12 can serve as a guide.
The negotiation process is based on the project manager and the other party attempting in
good faith to reach a solution that benefits both—in other words, a win-win solution. Project
managers need to be vigilant, however, because not everyone they must negotiate with takes
that same attitude. Smart project managers recognize that their reputation is based on how
they act in all situations. Therefore, even when negotiating against someone who plays hard-
ball, it is still wise to stay ethical and keep emotions in check.
Step 1 involves advance fact finding to determine what is needed from the negotiation.
This may include checking with the sponsor and/or other stakeholders and determining the

impact that various settlements may have on the project. It also includes seeking to under-
stand both what the other party is likely to want and how he or she may act during the
negotiations.
Step 2 is for the project manager to understand the bottom line. What is the minimum
acceptable result? Just as when buying a car, a project manager needs to understand when to
walk away. This can vary a great deal depending on how much power each party has. Project
managers need to understand that if they have the power and take advantage of their nego-
tiation partner, that partner may not work with them on a future project. Therefore, the goal
is not to always drive the hardest bargain, but to drive a fair bargain.
Step 3 is for the project manager to understand the underlying needs of the other
party and to share his or her own needs. This is not a 10-second political sound bite
that says “take it or leave it.” This is developing a real understanding of each other’s
needs. Once both parties understand what the other really needs, various creative solu-
tions can be developed. This is the essence of Step 4.
Step 5 consists of the process and strategies of the negotiation itself. It is helpful to
keep in mind the ultimate goal while focusing on the many details of information shar-
ing, trading of concessions, and exploring possible solutions. Step 6 is actually a
reminder to reach an agreement and then to document that agreement.
Summary
While the project core team is ideally assembled early
in the project to participate in chartering and planning
the project, SMEs are commonly assigned as needed.
Project managers often try to secure the services of
these important people as early in the project as possi-
ble. This often involves negotiating with the functional
managers to whom the SMEs report. When new proj-
ect team members arrive, they need to be on-boarded;
that is, they need to understand the project and start to
develop working relationships with their new team
members. Experienced project managers ensure that
the new members understand project goals but also
share their personal goals so that both can simulta-
neously be achieved.
Teams progress through typical stages of develop-
ment. High-performing project teams share a number
of characteristics. Project managers can use under-
standing of these stages and characteristics to guide

their team to better performance. They do this by
assessing individual and team capabilities and develop-
ing strategies to improve both. The project team often
develops team operating principles in the charter.
Many teams expand upon these with more specific
team ground rules. The ground rules are tailored to
the unique needs of the project situation, but generally
include both rules for improving relationships among
team members as well as improving the process of how
the team works.
The project manager must manage the human side
of his project. This involves utilizing appropriate forms
of power in managing the project team to obtain
desired results. Project teams also need to manage and
control stakeholder engagements through understanding
their expectations, delivering on those expectations, and
communicating effectively. Projects are ripe for many
kinds of conflict. Constructive conflict over ideas often
yields better approaches, but destructive conflict that
gets personal needs to be headed off when possible and
dealt with when it occurs. Many good project manage-
ment practices and techniques are helpful in channeling
conflict in constructive directions. Project managers also
need to utilize many general conflict reduction techni-
ques within the project team, but also with and between
various stakeholders.

Centralizing Planning and Control in a Large Company After
Many Acquisitions
The restaurant chain where I work was founded over
50 years ago. Through internal growth and external
acquisitions, this company has become a Fortune 500
company. The company recently decided to centralize
merchandizing, retail operations control, advertising,
and sales planning for the enterprise.
Human resources (HR) and other support
organizations needed to improve their performance to
support this massive change. Cycle times were too
long, service quality was too low, and internal
customers frequently complained about corporate
functions. HR started its transformation by creating a
process improvement team to lead toward a process-
driven structure with work drivers identified to
establish staffing levels. A new HR vice president had a
vision for the operation, and her leadership was critical
to make anything happen.
Up to this point, process engineering had only been
applied to manufacturing and distribution operations.
The culture for process engineering, project
management, and change management was generally
immature in the company. This was declared to be the
biggest change to our HR function in 35 years. A vice
president was assigned to make the HR transition
happen.
The project manager assigned to this project
immediately interviewed the various management
members of the HR organization and the retail
operations transition team. He created a project charter
to define the scope, objectives, problem statement,
outcomes expected, benefits, team members, and
inputs for this project. This project manager
interviewed all senior staff members for their insights.
A communications plan was drafted because this
change directly touched several hundred persons and
indirectly many tens of thousands. The company is a
very large distributed organization with many global
operations. Therefore, a great deal of collaboration was
required to create the buy-in needed. A conference was
held for all HR leaders to begin developing this needed
buy-in.
In preparation for the conference, the project
manager created the following high-level WBS:
1. Planning the HR Transformation
2. Initiating the Project
3. Planning the Workshops
4. Stakeholder Analysis
5. Communications Plan
6. Planning the Project
7. Executing the Plan
8. Holding the Workshops
9. Identifying Opportunities for Improvements
10. Obtaining the VOC (Voice of Customer)
11. Creating the Foundational Communications
12. Initial Launch
13. Executing the Implementation Plan
14. Sustaining the Transformation
A schedule was created that reflected all the WBS
elements needed to perform this massive organizational
change initiative, driven by process analysis and by
meeting all the relevant PMI PMBOK® guidelines for
project management good practices. This project
schedule covered the elements of a plan to gather Voice
of the Customer information and perform workshops for
the identified Centers of Excellence:
1. The business processing center
2. Total reward systems
3. Administration systems
4. Workforce planning systems
5. Talent management systems
6. Systems and data management
7. Training and development
The project schedule included all the communications
needed to create synergy toward an agreed upon
solution. At the end of the first conference, we had a core
team meeting of five leaders. The job of the core team
was to define a vision for the organization, a mission
statement for the operation, and an elevator speech that
defined the project’s objectives and could be repeated in
less than 45 seconds to a novice on the topic. This team’s
efforts gave us great clarity regarding what we were
trying to accomplish.
Next, we brought in over 100 HR professionals from
around the company for a series of workshops. An
agenda and handouts were created to drive the
workshops. During the workshops artifacts were
created to define the “as is” and “to be” process states.
These models were built in Supplier, Input, Process,
Output, Customer (SIPOC) and organization

deployment process maps. In addition, we created
organization structures to support the future-state
process maps. Once we designed structures, we built
job description documents and measurement plans for
the new and old processes. The processes modeled
impacted all HR operations. We needed to know where
the work would be accomplished. We started the
detailed organization chart reviews. We needed to
know where the work was done, and by how many
persons, today. Then we could start to estimate how
many resources might be needed in a future state by
location and by element of work.
We evolved a framework of principles to drive the
project forward, which included:
•
Streamline every process using the lean Six Sigma
tools.
•
Focus on quality, speed, and cost while delivering
improved value.
•
Take transactions out to a service center where a
lower cost is achieved.
•
Drive all outside agreements toward negotiated ser-
vice level agreements.
•
Consider multiple alternatives for the sourcing of
needed services.
•
Improve the client-facing organization.
•
Build Centers of Excellence that deliver improved value.
•
Push
employee
support
closer
to
them
while
leveraging consolidated service center capabilities.
Monthly HR leader conference calls, weekly status
reports, preliminary design sessions, corporate staff
design sessions, and follow-up conferences for
leaders were all part of the high-touch, high-
communications approach to this project. We expect
the many automation initiatives, headcount
reductions, vendor outsourcing efforts, and in-
sourcing of transactions to a wholly owned service
center to deliver millions of dollars of cost
reductions across the company. We promoted lean
and improvement ideas continually to the leadership.
We have collected field-based best practices and
have moved into a phase to validate these practices.
Once validated, these best practices will be rolled
out to all operations. We communicate by posting
everything to a SharePoint site for all to see. We also
use e-mail communications and have many one-
on-one telephone calls.
We are now presenting the new design for
implementation and are getting buy-in. We continue
to involve others and to learn what will meet their
needs—and so far we are spot on with high
acceptance. At one time, we thought all regions were
different, and they are, but their processes and
structures are nearly 80 percent the same. We have
reached agreement that one common process is
acceptable to all regions asked. This is a major
breakthrough. We also have had concessions from
labor relations regarding its role and from those
regions that were already down the road on a couple
key position implementations.
The team concepts that were applicable to this
project were as follows:
•
Recognize the Forming, Storming, Norming, and
Performing stages.
•
Create a strong vision to rally the team.
•
Ask the customers of the process for requirements.
•
Have consistent sponsorship of the project.
•
Respect, empower, and engage everyone in
a
change initiative.
•
Respect
differences
and
leverage
the
value
of
diversity.
•
You cannot overcommunicate—so communicate.
•
Make everything an open book.

Determining Project Progress and Results
The fundamental reason for determining project progress and results comes
down to one thing—presenting actionable, decision-making information to
project leaders.
A major U.S. electric utility company is continuously faced with the
daunting task of managing over 1,200 simultaneous projects in all phases of
planning, execution, and completion over a geographic area consisting of
five states. These projects are supported by over 40 departments within
the utility and hundreds of external contractors and equipment suppliers.
Over 85 percent of these projects take place over multiple years. There are
over 15,000 activities tracked for active projects every month. Today, many
of these projects are related to SmartGrid efforts to fundamentally change
the way the electric utility system delivers power to homes, schools, and
businesses.

This utility regularly sets the standard for its industry each year by completing
over 90 percent of its projects on time and utilizing its annual project budget
within just a few percentage points. How is this accomplished?
By identifying and collecting just the right amount of financial, scheduling,
resource, and risk management data, and by focusing intently on turning raw
data into actionable information for the groups leading and supporting the
projects, the utility’s project controls staff is able to continuously find and
highlight the information that requires leadership attention and project team
action.
With the large number of projects being managed, the focus on individual
projects decreases and management of the entire group of projects as a
portfolio
becomes
paramount.
The
actionable
information
presented
highlights significant issues for individual projects, but more importantly is
able to forecast trends over the entire portfolio and extended spans of time,
helping turn earned-value statistics into meaningful strategies.
Presenting valuable decision-making data to the multiple resource and
leadership groups required to support a project provides the critical linkage
between the feedback of raw data and the ability to successfully control a
single project or an entire multi-year portfolio. Project data collection and
management
presents
the
opportunity
to
simultaneously
manage
an
organization’s “profit, people, and planet” objectives in an optimal way.
As you move forward with this chapter and your own projects, consider
the use and impact of the project information that needs to be collected.
What are the key factors for your project—financial, environmental, resource
management, scheduling, risk identification, stakeholder management, or
others? Who needs the project progress data, and exactly what do they need
to know to make good decisions and successfully achieve organizational
objectives?
Identifying, collecting, managing and presenting data that allow you to
control critical aspects of your projects is a fundamental element of project
success.

The word determine has multiple meanings. While each offers a slightly different per-
spective, collectively, they help a project manager understand what she needs to do to
ensure that her project is progressing adequately and will yield the intended results in
the end. Determine can mean:
•
To give direction to or decide the course of
•
To be the cause of, to influence, or to regulate
•
To limit in scope
•
To reach a decision
•
To come to a conclusion or resolution1
Project managers, in the course of planning, give direction to a project. Many projects
also require replanning due to any number of causes. Project managers sometimes can
only influence how work is accomplished (when people do not report to them), but they
may be able to regulate or demand the work to be accomplished at a particular time or in
a particular manner. To be successful in influencing and regulating project work, the project
manager needs to consider the stakeholder priorities and communications needs, as
discovered in Chapter 5, and use those to design the monitoring and control mechanisms
described in this chapter. Many stakeholders on projects attempt to persuade the project
manager and team to deliver more scope, but one important role of the project manager
is to jealously guard the agreed-upon scope. Many times during a project, decisions need
to be made. The project manager needs to do one of the following:
•
Personally make these decisions
•
Be part of a group that makes them
•
Delegate them to others
•
Facilitate the process by which the decision is made
Project managers frequently need to follow up to ensure that decisions are made and
then carried out. Finally, the project manager is responsible for making sure that the
project is satisfactorily completed.
14-1 Project Balanced Scorecard Approach
To successfully accomplish all five aspects of project determination, a project manager
can think in terms of a balanced scorecard approach to her project. The concept behind
a balanced scorecard is that an organization needs to be evaluated along customer,
internal business, financial, and growth and innovation perspectives. If one considers a
project as a temporary organization, the same aspects make sense to monitor and control
a project. Exhibit 14.1 shows a project balanced scorecard approach to project
determination.
When a project manager seeks to monitor and control a project, the different aspects
are often interrelated, and their impacts on each other need to be considered. For exam-
ple, a proposed change may impact the scope, quality, schedule, and/or cost. However,
to understand project control, each aspect must first be considered individually. This
chapter begins with the project manager controlling internal project issues. The next
major section of this chapter deals with the customer-related issue of quality. The final
sections deal with the financial issues of scope, schedule, and cost. The project manager
can utilize a number of tools to manage schedule overloads and conflicts as well as to
reprioritize the work. Earned value and project scheduling software such as MS Project
can prove to be useful for this. Growth and innovation issues of participant development
are covered in Chapter 13, and knowledge management are covered in Chapter 15.

14-2 Internal Project Issues
While all aspects of a project are important and interrelated when determining progress
and results, a logical starting place is the project work that needs to be accomplished.
Closely related are the risks that may impede the work and adequate communication. Col-
lectively, these form the project’s internal issues. These issues can be envisioned as the pro-
ject’s nerve center. Problems in any of them travel to all other project areas just as nerves in
a body carry information throughout. When dealing with this project nerve center, project
managers direct and manage project work; monitor and control the project work; perform
integrated change control; control project risks; and manage and control communications.
14-2a Direct and Manage Project Work
Directing and managing project work is “the process of leading and performing the work
defined in the project management plan and implementing approved changes to achieve
the project’s objectives.”2 When project managers authorize project work, they should
empower others to the extent possible, yet control them to the extent necessary. It should
be clear who is allowed to authorize each portion of work to commence. The project man-
agement plan identifies work to be accomplished, but the project manager or his or her
appointee must tell someone when it is time to perform the work. Often, spending limits
are intertwined with work authorization (e.g., “Please perform this activity and do not
spend more than $X on it. Report back to me for approval if you need to spend more.”).
The work to be performed can come from one of several sources. The primary source is
the work package level of the work breakdown structure. However, approved corrective
actions, preventive actions, and defect repairs may also trigger work to be authorized.
When directing project work, tradeoffs are often present both between the project and
other work and within the project itself. Organizations often have many projects and a
variety of other work that must all be accomplished. Some work is of higher priority
than other work. A project manager needs to understand where her work fits in the pri-
ority. If her project is relatively low in priority, she may have trouble getting people to
perform their activities very quickly. In a case like that, the project manager and sponsor
should have open communications so the sponsor can either help the project manager
secure the resources needed and/or understand that the project could be late through

no fault of the project manager. As the project progresses, are there changing priorities
that impact project priorities? Remember, any proposed change to the project scope,
quality, schedule, or budget needs to be processed through the integrated change control
system described later in this chapter.
Projects are undertaken with scope goals and with constraints on cost, schedule, and
quality. Exhibit 14.2 gives an example of Tatro, Inc., dealing with project tradeoffs.
Well-developed project charters, effective stakeholder management, and clear commu-
nications all help the project manager make sensible tradeoff decisions. Sometimes, an
owner representative works closely with the project manager to make these decisions.
Skills an owner representative can use when working closely with a project manager to
effectively make these tradeoff decisions are shown in Exhibit 14.3.

PROJECT TRADEOFF DECISIONS AT TATRO, INC.
Tatro, Inc. is a company that describes itself as a designer, builder, and caretaker of fine landscap-
ing. It has both commercial and private (homeowner) clients. Landscaping projects for private
homes often are well over $100,000. Homeowners who contract for landscaping projects of this
magnitude are ultra-successful people who will not change their mind once they decide they want
something special. These clients tend to focus closely on the process of a project. They wish to
have polite, skilled workers with no interruptions. The reason they wish to have the project com-
pleted is to create a “wow factor.” Therefore, they will rarely compromise at all on either scope or
quality, but they will often compromise on the necessary cost and schedule.

14-2b Monitor and Control Project Work
As stated in Chapter 1, monitoring and controlling project work includes “the pro-
cesses of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the progress to meet the performance objec-
tives defined in the project plan.”3 To monitor means to “collect project performance data
with respect to a plan, produce performance measures, and report and disseminate perfor-
mance information.”4 As stated in Chapter 11, control means “comparing actual perfor-
mance with planned performance, analyzing variances, assessing trends to effect process
improvements, evaluating possible alternatives, and recommending appropriate corrective
action when needed.”5 A variance is “a quantifiable deviation, departure, or divergence
away from a known baseline or expected value.”6 What all of this means is that a smart
project manager keeps an eye on many things that can indicate how well the project is
doing and is prepared to act if necessary to get the project back on track. The most difficult
part of monitoring and controlling is figuring out what metrics to keep, what to measure,
and how to report the results to various decision makers as necessary.
Monitoring and controlling are not the kinds of work that is done once and is fin-
ished. Monitoring and controlling activities occur in parallel with project execution.
Monitoring and controlling are a continuous, overarching part of an entire project’s life
cycle, from project initiation through project closing. Since the purpose of monitoring
and controlling project work is to be able to take corrective action, these activities need
to be timely. In fact, the reverse of an old adage is in order. Instead of shooting the mes-
senger when there is bad news, reward the messenger if the message is delivered quickly
enough to bring the project back into control quickly and at low cost.
To the extent possible, letting workers self-control their work adds to their enthusi-
asm. However, the project manager is ultimately accountable for all of the project results
and needs to develop a sense for how much control is necessary, given the work and the
person performing it.
TYPES OF PROJECT CONTROL While this section deals with monitoring and control-
ling project work, the remainder of this chapter deals with monitoring and controlling
each of the other project management knowledge areas. Two types of control are used
extensively on projects. Both compare actual performance against the project plan. One
type is steering control, in which the work is compared to the plan on a continual basis
to see if progress is equal to, better than, or worse than the project plan. Adjustments
can be made as often as necessary. The second type of control is go/no-go control.
Go/no-go control requires a project manager to receive approval to continue. This can
be conducted at milestones (such as those developed in the project charter) or when
someone needs to determine if a key deliverable is acceptable or not. If it is acceptable,
the project continues as planned. If not, either the work needs to be redone or the proj-
ect could even be cancelled. For both types of control, resulting change requests can
include corrective actions, preventive actions, or defect repair.
The results of monitoring and controlling project work, schedule, budget, risks, or
anything else can range from minor to major depending on how close the actual prog-
ress is to the plan. This can be seen in Exhibit 14.4.
Depending on the extent to which actual progress performance varies from planned
performance, the results of monitoring and controlling activities can suggest anything
from modifying the charter to transferring project deliverables as planned.
•
If the actual progress is very different from the original intent, perhaps the project
charter needs to be revisited to ensure that the project still makes sense.
•
If progress is somewhat different from planned but the charter is still a good guide,
perhaps the project plan needs to be adjusted.
Chapter 14 Determining Project Progress and Results
385

•
If the project plan is still a useful guide, perhaps minor adjustments need to be made
in day-to-day instructions within the project executing stage.
•
Finally, if the results indicate the customer is ready to accept the project deliverables,
perhaps it is time to proceed into the project closing stage.
PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL George and John are new project man-
agers fresh out of college. Both are approached by internal customers of their projects
(managers of departments where the project deliverables will be used). Their customers
tell them what a fantastic job each is doing. The customers then say, “This is great! Could
you add these couple of little improvements to it? Then it would be even more valuable to
me.” George, wanting to please his customer, says, “Yes, we can add that little bit.” John’s
immediate answer is “Let’s see what impact that might have on the schedule, budget, qual-
ity, and project team. I will be happy to consider it, but want to be sure to deliver the proj-
ect results we promised on time and on budget.” George, in his eagerness to please, made a
classic mistake. Many great projects have been derailed because someone stroked the ego of
a project manager who then agreed to changes without understanding their impact.
Perform integrated change control is “the process of reviewing all change requests,
approving changes, and managing changes to deliverables, organizational process assets,
project documents, and project management plan; and communicating their disposition.”7
Change control is “a process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or base-
lines associated with the project are identified, documented, approved, or rejected.”8
Change control includes considering the impact of any change, deciding whether to agree
to the change, and then documenting and managing that change. Proposed changes are
documented in a change request such as the one shown in Exhibit 6.13.
The decision to approve the proposed change then needs to be made by the correct
person or group. Generally, if the change requires a change in the project charter (or
contract for an external project), then the sponsor and/or customer decide. If the change
does not rise to that level, often a project manager is empowered to make the decision.
Some organizations use a change control board which is “a formally chartered group
responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, delaying, or rejecting changes to the

project, and for recording and communicating such decisions.”9 The change control
board is often composed of the project manager, sponsor, core team, and perhaps other
key stakeholders. Since some changes have far-reaching impacts, it is often wise to in-
clude people with different knowledge and skills on the change review board.
Change is a reality on virtually all projects. While we cannot predict or plan what
changes will occur, we can plan for how we will deal with those changes. Some projects
are easier than others to plan, especially the later parts of the project. If the planning
team can plan most details at the outset, change control may be the primary method
they use for handling change. On other projects, where it is difficult to plan the later part
in detail until results from the early parts of the project are known, change control is still
used, but it is not enough. What is also used in these cases is rolling wave planning,
described in Chapter 6. The early parts of the project are planned in detail, and the later
parts are planned in less detail until later when additional detail is added. Often, a detailed
plan for the following section of the project is required before being allowed to proceed.
On Agile projects, change is expected, and the only part that is planned in detail at
the outset is the first iteration. Subsequent iterations are planned in a rolling wave fash-
ion. Within an iteration, there is great reluctance to change.
14-2c Monitoring and Controlling Project Risk
During project planning, the project team normally develops a risk management plan
that is used to guide risk monitoring and controlling activities. They also normally create
a risk register to record each identified risk, its priority, potential causes, and potential
responses. The risk management plan and risk register are used to monitor and control
project risks, and to resolve them when they occur.
Control risks is “the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified
risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effec-
tiveness throughout the project.”10 On some projects, the majority of risk events that
materialize are ones that the project team has previously identified. Efforts needed on
these risks largely include tracking the identified risks, executing the response plans,
and evaluating their effectiveness. Project managers know it is wise to consider multiple
responses to a given risk. This is true both because some risks cannot be fully handled
with just one strategy and because the first strategy may not be the best strategy.
On other projects, however, many unanticipated risks may materialize. This could be
partly because risk planning was not complete and sound. However, it could be at least
partly due to events that would have been so unlikely that the team could not have been
expected to plan for them. In either event, specific contingency plans may not be in place
to deal with these risks. Identifying these new risks is vital—and the sooner the better.
Two categories of project management methods can help to deal with previously uniden-
tified risks. First, the project team in planning may recognize that unknown risks may
surface, and they may add contingency reserve of time, budget, and/or other resources
to cover these unknowns. Good project practice suggests a need for this. The amount
of cost and budget reserves that are included can vary extensively based upon the custo-
mer’s perception of risk and the type of project that is involved. Competitive pressures
often dictate a lower limit on reserves than project managers may prefer.
The second category of project management methods includes a number of good
practices that project managers often utilize anyway. These practices can be classified
according to whether the project team has full, partial, or no control over the events, as
shown in Exhibit 14.5. Note especially the second column, which deals with risks par-
tially within a project manager’s control. A project manager cannot completely control
many situations, but by using good leadership and ethics, the project manager can cer-
tainly help create a situation where others want to help the project.

14-2d Manage Communications
Manage communications is “the process of creating, distributing, storing, retrieving, and
the ultimate disposition of project information in accordance with the communications
management plan.”11 To successfully communicate the right project information to the
right stakeholders, in the right format, at the right time, several things must happen.
First, all of this needs to be in the project communications management plan, as
described in Chapter 5. Then, while the project is underway, the project manager and
team need to determine any additional information needs not already uncovered, estab-
lish an information retrieval and distribution system, collect information on executed
work and work in progress, and then report progress to all stakeholders.
DETERMINE PROJECT INFORMATION NEEDS Some stakeholder information needs
were identified during communications planning such as authorization to proceed, direc-
tion setting, status reporting, and approval of outputs. Other information needs arise
during project execution. All need to be handled accurately, promptly, and in a manner
that balances effectiveness with cost and effort.
•
Communicate accurately—Accurate communications means not only being factually
honest, but also presenting information in a manner that people are likely to inter-
pret correctly.
•
Communicate promptly— “Promptly” means providing the information soon
enough so that it is useful to the recipient.
•
Communicate effectively—Effectiveness is the extent to which the receiver opens,
understands, and acts appropriately upon the communication.
It is very easy to just copy everyone on an e-mail, but that is not convenient or effec-
tive for some people. Face-to-face communication tends to be most effective, telephone

Part 3 Performing Projects

less so, and e-mail and formal reports even less. It is in the project manager’s best inter-
est to communicate effectively since the information provided allows stakeholders to
make decisions, remain motivated, and believe that the project is in control.
ESTABLISH INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM Project
information can be retrieved from many different sources. It can also be distributed via
many systems. Project management software such as MS Project is frequently used for
schedule information and sometimes for cost and human resource information. Many
methods of communicating are used by project managers. In this information age, proj-
ect managers need to keep three things in mind with communications.
1. Target the communications. More is not better when people are already overloaded.
2. Many methods are available, and the choices change rapidly. Use new methods as
they help, but do not discard proven methods just for the sake of change.
3. Projects often have many stakeholders who need specific information. Use your
communications plan and always keep asking if there is any other stakeholder in
need of upward, downward, or sideways communications.
Tatro, Inc., uses a hosted project management page on its website that clients can
access with a password to witness project progress from anywhere in the world on a
24/7 basis. It displays photos that show actual progress for the client to view.
One specific skill that project managers can use to retrieve information is active lis-
tening. Active listening requires focus on what the person is saying. The active listener
can ask clarifying questions and paraphrase to ensure that he or she understands exactly
what is meant. Making eye contact and using eager body language encourages the
speaker to continue. An effort to simultaneously understand both the meaning of the
message and the emotions the communicator is feeling helps the receiver to understand
the full message. Recognizing that many speakers are not especially skilled and paying
more attention to their message than their style of delivery also helps. A project manager
often can successfully end the conversation by orally confirming what he or she just
heard and by following up with an e-mail for documentation.
COLLECT INFORMATION ON EXECUTED WORK AND WORK IN PROGRESS Project
managers gather data on the work they have authorized so they can understand the prog-
ress they are making. This information is necessary for scheduling additional work, for
understanding how they are doing with respect to the schedule, and for quality purposes.
A project manager may try to gather data to answer the following typical questions:
•
How well is this particular activity proceeding in terms of time and budget?
•
How well is the entire project proceeding in terms of time and budget?
•
How much more money will need to be spent to finish?
•
To what extent does the quality of this work meet requirements?
•
How many hours of human resource time have we used to complete this activity,
compared to how much we estimated?
•
What methods that we have used are worth repeating?
•
What methods that we have used need to be improved before we do that type of
work again?
•
What evidence supports the answers to the above questions?
REPORT PERFORMANCE Performance reporting includes gathering work performance
data, and using it to create work performance information and reports. Work perfor-
mance data are “the raw observations and measurements identified during activities
being performed to carry out the project work.”12 Work performance information is
Chapter 14 Determining Project Progress and Results
389

“the performance data collected from various controlling processes, analyzed in context
and integrated based on relationships across areas.”13 Work performance reports are
“the physical or electronic representation of work performance information compiled in
project documents, intended to generate discussions, actions, or awareness.”14
Performance can be reported either at fixed time intervals or at key project mile-
stones. Detailed progress can be reported frequently within the project team and to func-
tional managers who control resources—perhaps weekly or even daily on a project with
critical time pressure. More general progress may be reported on a less frequent basis to
sponsors, senior management, and clients—perhaps semiweekly or monthly. If regular
reports and meetings already exist within the parent organization that can serve for per-
formance reporting vehicles for a project, by all means use them. On the other hand, if
your project needs additional or different meetings and reports, then develop and use
those as well.
Progress reporting within the project team and to functional managers who control
resources is often done in the form of meetings. The emphasis should be on specifics.
Each team member can report for each deliverable for which he is responsible: the target
date, current status, and what other work or information on which progress depends.
Once all of the deliverables have been reported, the project team can update the risk reg-
ister and issues log. Recommended changes that are within the project manager’s discre-
tion are either approved or rejected and then documented. Recommended changes
beyond the project manager’s discretion are formally sent to the sponsor or change con-
trol board for consideration. Approved changes become part of the project plan with
activities, responsibilities, and timing assigned. Finally, progress reporting meetings are
a great time to capture lessons learned and to eat free food!
Reporting performance to sponsors, management, and clients can be in the form
of either meetings or reports. Think in terms of three time horizons, as shown in
Exhibit 14.6. It is often helpful to establish an agenda for progress report meetings based
upon what sponsors wish to know concerning each of these three time horizons.
1. Past time period—The first time horizon is the immediate past period between
your last report and now. When looking back like this, it is important to be able to
state what the plan called for to be accomplished during that time and what was
actually accomplished. Any variance or difference between the approved plan and

actual performance, along with reasons for the variance, should also be part of the
retrospective portion of performance reporting.
2. Current time period—The second time horizon is from now until the next
performance report is due. What work is to be accomplished in this time period
(current plan)? What risks and issues are foreseen? Finally, what changes need to
be approved?
3. Future time period—The third time horizon is after the next reporting period.
Remember the concept of rolling wave planning—the plan for the later part of the
project might still be evolving, but what is known about it right now? Sponsors
especially want to know what future risks and issues are envisioned because they
may be able to head some problems off before they grow.
Communication is frequent and rapid on agile projects. Progress report meetings as
stated above are held every morning as brief (15 minutes) standup meetings where no
one is allowed to have a chair or coffee. Each core team member discusses yesterday as
the past time period and today as the current time period. The more distant future is
often not discussed in these meetings. Agile projects often use a burn down chart to
show the amount of work remaining. A burn down chart shows the number of days in
the iteration on the horizontal axis and both the planned (ideal) number of work days of
work remaining and the actual number of work days of work remaining on the vertical
axis. Exhibit 14.7 shows a burn down chart for a project with a 20 work day iteration
and 2.1 days of work to be completed each day ideally. This is typical for a three person
team who can each complete 0.7 days of work per day given other time demands.
14-2e Control Communications
Control communications is “the process of monitoring and controlling communications
throughout the entire project life cycle to ensure the information needs of the project
stakeholders are met.”15 The project manager and core team often discuss whether the
communications are following the plan, how effective they are, and how to improve their
effectiveness.

14-3 Customer Issues
The second major perspective included in a balanced scorecard approach to project con-
trol is the customer. Customers want the deliverables of the project. They want the
results to be useful (quality).
14-3a Perform Quality Assurance
As previously defined in Chapter 11, performing quality assurance is “the process of auditing
the quality requirements and the results of quality control measurements to ensure appropri-
ate quality standards and operational definitions are used.”16 This implies that a project man-
ager both ensures that work is performed correctly and that key stakeholders are convinced
that the work is performed correctly. Project stakeholders form their opinions regarding qual-
ity of a project both by how the work is performed and by how the deliverables meet stan-
dards. Many activities that form this broad interpretation of quality assurance are related to
other project management processes. For example, to convince customers that you are per-
forming work correctly, some customer relationship-building activities also fit in the manage
stakeholder engagement process. For another example, to perform the work correctly, some of
the building human capability activities can also fit in the process of developing a project team.
Two areas that are specific to project quality assurance are conducting quality audits
and improving project processes.
AUDITS A quality audit is “a structured, independent process to determine if project
activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes and procedures.”17
For an audit to be successful, the intent must be to improve the manner in which work
is accomplished and not to punish people. With this in mind, an audit can begin with a
review of the official documentation of how a process should be performed. The auditors
then often interview the workers and have them explain (or better yet, demonstrate) how
they perform the work. Records are investigated to see if the documentation is complete
and current. At this point, the auditors have the following three sets of data:
1. Documentation of how the work is supposed to be done (the standards either
developed or adopted in quality planning)
2. Descriptions of how the work is actually done
3. Documentation to verify how the work was completed
If discrepancies are found among these three, the auditors can recommend that work-
ers perform work more consistently with the standards, that workers document their
work better, and/or that some of the standards be improved. Project quality audits can
be a fruitful source of lessons learned. These lessons should be shared so that other proj-
ect teams can benefit. Remember, project quality audits, as part of quality assurance, are
meant to help deliver good quality results and convince stakeholders that everything is
okay because proper procedures are being used.
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT A process is “a systematic series of activities directed
toward causing an end result such that one or more inputs will be acted upon to create
one or more outputs.”18 Processes can be measured for both efficiency and effectiveness.
Efficiency is the ratio of outputs to inputs. A more efficient process uses fewer inputs to
create the same number of outputs. This could equate to less work hours or less money
spent to create the same project deliverable. Effectiveness is the extent to which a process
is creating the desired deliverables. A more effective process is one that creates higher-
quality deliverables and that better pleases the stakeholders. Process improvement can
deal with both efficiency and effectiveness.
392
Part 3 Performing Projects

There are many avenues for improving project processes. One is to interpret the
results of quality control measurements with an eye toward process improvement. These
quality control measurements can often be used in the context of a seven-step or
DMAIC process improvement model such as the one shown in Exhibit 3.9. Feedback
from customers, suppliers, work associates, and other stakeholders can often lead to
suggestions for improving processes. These suggestions might pinpoint opportunities to
improve both the inputs into a process and the actions within the process.
Another useful method of process improvement is benchmarking. Benchmarking is a
structured consideration of how another organization performs a process with an eye
toward determining how to improve one’s own performance. It is not directly copying
the methods. Benchmarking consists of the following steps:
1. Determine a process that needs dramatic improvement.
2. Identify another organization that performs that process very well.
3. Make a deal with that organization to learn from them (they might require pay-
ment or the sharing of one of the observer’s best practices with them).
4. Determine what needs to be observed and what questions need to be asked.
5. Make a site visit to observe and question the other organization.
6. Decide which observed methods will help the organization.
7. Adapt the methods to fit the organization’s culture and situation.
8. Try the new methods on a small scale.
9. Evaluate the results.
10. If the methods are good enough, adopt them.
14-3b Control Quality
Quality assurance deals with using correct policies and convincing stakeholders that the
project team is capable of producing good output. Quality control (the current subject),
on the other hand, deals with comparing specific project measurements with stake-
holders’ standards. The purposes of quality control on projects are to reduce the number
of defects and inefficiencies, as well as to improve the project process and outputs. Qual-
ity control consists of:
•
Monitoring the project to ensure that everything is proceeding according to plan
•
Identifying when things are different enough from the plan to warrant preventive or
corrective actions
•
Repairing defects
•
Determining and eliminating root causes of problems
•
Providing specific measurements for quality assurance
•
Providing recommendations for corrective and preventive actions
•
Implementing approved changes as directed by the project’s integrated change
control system.
MONITOR THE PROJECT QUALITY Project managers using quality control focus on
project inputs, processes, and outputs. When considering inputs, a project manager wants
to ensure that workers assigned are capable of doing their work. He also works with suppli-
ers to ensure that the materials, information, and other inputs provided meet the required
specifications and work satisfactorily. When considering the project processes, the manager
wants to minimize rework because it wastes time and money, which are in short supply on
most projects. Rework also often has negative impacts on both worker morale and stake-
holder relations because it is very discouraging to make and/or receive junk, even if it is fixed
eventually. When considering outputs, a project manager may first use internal inspection to
Chapter 14 Determining Project Progress and Results
393

ensure the deliverables work before they are sent to
the customer. External inspection may also be
required to prove to the customer that the deliverables
are correct.
While the specifics vary greatly from project to
project, there are some useful general lessons regard-
ing the timing and types of project inspections,
including the following:
•
Inspect before a critical or expensive process to
make sure the inputs are good before spending
a large amount of money or time on them.
•
Process steps where one worker hands off work
to another worker are good places for both
workers to inspect.
•
Milestones identified in the project charter
provide good inspection points.
•
As practiced in software development, think of inspection in terms of units (indi-
vidual components), integration (how components work together), and the system
(how the deliverable as a whole performs).
QUALITY CONTROL TERMS Many terms with specific meanings are used in project
quality control. Exhibit 14.8 shows pairs of terms that are sometimes confused, and the
differences between each pair are described in the following paragraphs. While few pro-
jects repeat processes enough times to formally use statistical quality control, the con-
cepts are still quite useful in making good decisions.
Prevention versus Inspection
Prevention is keeping errors out of a process, while
inspection is trying to find errors so they do not reach the customer. Preventing a prob-
lem in the first place is preferred over trying to use an inspection to find it. Prevention is
a cheaper method. Inspection does not guarantee that a problem is found. Inspection
should be practiced, but every effort should be made to prevent problems from happen-
ing in the first place.

Sample versus Population
A population is all of the possible items in a set, such as all the
studentsina class.Itisoftencostly,difficult,or evenimpossible toinspect an entire population.
When that is the situation, a sample or subset is inspected. Three students, picked randomly,
wouldbea sample.Thekeyistouse a bigenough sample tobe representativeof the population,
but a small enough sample that it is cost- and time-effective.
Attribute versus Variable
An attribute is determined with a yes-or-no test, while a vari-
able is something that can be measured. Either one may be chosen. For example, if one of the
goals of a project was to teach all of the people in a client’s company, an attribute for each
employee might be, “Did that person pass the test?” A variable might be, “How many ques-
tions did each employee score correctly?” Attributes are usually quicker (and cheaper) to
observe, but may not yield as much detailed information. Project managers make a tradeoff
between more information and more cost when they decide if they will count or measure.
Precision versus Accuracy
A process is precise when the outputs are consistently very
similar, such as shooting three shots at a target that all land in a cluster near each other. A
process is accurate when, on the average, it produces what the customer wants, such as three
shots that triangulate on the target. Ideally a process is both precise and accurate.
Tolerance versus Control Limit
A tolerance limit is what the customer will accept
and is sometimes called the voice of the customer. This could be if the customer wants a
1-inch bolt, perhaps they are willing to accept bolts ranging from a lower tolerance limit
of 0.99 inches to an upper tolerance limit of 1.01 inches. A control limit reflects what the
process can consistently deliver when things are behaving normally and is sometimes
called the voice of the process. The upper and lower control limits are often statistically
calculated to be three standard deviations above or below the process average.
Capable versus In Control
A process is determined to be in control when the outputs
are all within the control limits. A process is considered capable when control limits are
within the tolerance limits so that customers can remain satisfied with project performance
even when the performance is outside of its tolerance. Project managers try to ensure that
their processes are both in control and capable of consistently delivering acceptable quality.
Special versus Common Cause
Special causes are statistically unlikely events that usually
mean something is different from normal. Common causes are normal or random variations
that are considered part of operating the system at its current capability. Special causes are
identified by individual points outside of the control limits or unusual patterns within the lim-
its. Common causes need systematic change for improvement—perhaps new methods or bet-
ter training or tools that would allow workers to more consistently produce excellent quality.
Special causes, on the other hand, require specific interventions that include identifying the
root causes and making changes so those same root causes do not happen again.
Preventive versus Corrective Action
Preventive action is a proactive approach of
making a change because a problem may occur otherwise. Corrective action is a reactive
approach of making a change to fix a problem that has occurred.
QUALITY CONTROL TOOLS A variety of quality control tools can be used effectively on
projects. Some of the most common tools and their primary uses on projects are shown
in Exhibit 11.12.
The following discussion presents a small example of a project process that is used to
demonstrate the project quality control tools. A straightforward presentation of each tool
is demonstrated. Multiple variations exist for some of the tools, and an interested student
can find more detailed examples and instruction in a statistics or quality textbook.

Flow Chart
A flow chart is a tool that project managers use as they begin to control qual-
ity. Flow charts can be used to show any level of detail from the overall flow of an entire
project (such as a network diagram of the project schedule) down to very specific details of
a critical process. Flow charts show clearly where a process starts and ends. Each step in the
process is shown by a box. Arrows show the direction in which information, money, or
physical things flow. Exhibit 14.9 is a flow chart of the process of estimating project cost.
This is a high-level flow chart of the process. Perhaps the project team looks at this
and realizes labor cost estimates are unreliable. They might decide they need more
detailed understanding of this step. One method would be to create a more detailed
flow chart of just that step. Another method is to gather some data using a check sheet
such as the one shown in Exhibit 14.10.
Check Sheet
Check sheets are customized for each application. Decide exactly what
data will be useful in understanding, controlling, and improving a process and create a
form to collect that information. It is helpful to also collect the date or time when each
event happened and notes regarding the impact or any special circumstances. When cre-
ating categories on a check sheet, it is wise to have a category entitled “other” because
many times a problem comes from an unexpected source.
Pareto Chart
Once a check sheet is used, the gathered data can be displayed on an anal-
ysis tool such as the Pareto chart shown in Exhibit 14.11. The purpose of the Pareto chart is
to quickly understand the primary sources of a particular problem using the 80/20 rule,
where 80 percent of defects often come from only about 20 percent of all the sources.
Note that, in this example, the error of using an incorrect scope shows the highest
cost impact by far. Therefore, that is probably the first place the project team looks for
improvements.
Cause and Effect Diagram
Exhibit 14.12 shows how the largest bar on the Pareto
chart often becomes the head of the fish on the cause and effect diagram—the result
that the project team tries to improve.

The cause and effect diagram (also commonly known as the fishbone diagram, because it
resembles a fish skeleton, and the Ishikawa diagram, after its developer) is constructed with
each “big bone” representing a category of possible causes. For example, in Exhibit 14.12, one

of the possible categories is “deliverable design,” meaning that maybe something about the
design of the project’s deliverables contributed to problems with the “head of the fish”—in
this case, using incorrect scope to estimate the labor cost. Once categories of possible causes
are identified, the project team brainstorms ideas with the goal of identifying as many
potential causes as possible. Once the team can think of no additional possible causes, they
decide to test one or more possible causes to see if they actually have an impact. Testing can
be done by gathering more data on the project as it is currently operating. Alternatively, a
project team can test a new method and then collect data on it.
Histogram
Once the additional data are gathered, they can be analyzed using a histo-
gram, run chart, and/or control chart. For example, if one of the potential causes of
using incorrect scope is that the client demands the cost estimate within four days of
job notification (this is, within the timing category), perhaps the charts would appear as
shown in Exhibit 14.13, Exhibit 14.14, or Exhibit 14.15.

A project manager can interpret several things from a histogram such as the one
shown in Exhibit 14.13. First, if nothing unusual is happening, a normal or bell-shaped
curve might be expected. However, this histogram is highly skewed, with much more
impact happening when the client demands an estimate within four days. When the
client demands the estimate in four days, the impact is approximately $1,600. When
comparing that to the total impact of about $15,000 for using the wrong scope, this error

appears to explain only a bit more than 10 percent of the total problem. It might be
worth changing this, but most of the problem will still exist. Therefore, changing this
factor alone does not solve the entire problem.
Run Chart
Perhaps the project team wants to see how one specific aspect of the work
process may change over time. If they collect data for two weeks on a daily basis and
show them on a run chart such as the one in Exhibit 14.14, they could determine trends
in how the process is changing over time.
The team could look for three types of variation. First, is there a trend either up or
down? In this example, there is an upward trend. Second, is there a repeating pattern,
such as a low every Monday or a high every Wednesday? In this case, it is too early to
tell. Both Tuesdays are up from Mondays, and both Thursdays are low, but day of week
does not seem like the major source of variation. The third type of variation is abrupt
changes, such as either a single point far higher or lower than the others or all of the
points suddenly being much higher or lower than previous points. The question teams
ask when trying to find this variation is: “How big of a change is big enough to count?”
Control Chart
Quality control charts are helpful in answering this question.
Exhibit 14.15 displays the same data on a control chart with a process average and con-
trol limits shown. This chart shows the final point above the upper control limit. This
means the variation is enough that it is not likely to have happened purely by chance.
Something is causing the variation—some sort of special cause.
When considering any of these quality control tools, remember, it is easy to get lost in
the details, but the purpose of quality control is to make sure the agreed-upon scope and
quality are met per the project charter.
14-4 Financial Issues
Cost control is obviously a financial issue. Cost, schedule, and scope are often so closely
intertwined that they are monitored and controlled at the same time, and changes in one
impact the others. Because of the close interrelationships between them, cost, schedule,
and scope are envisioned here as financial issues.
14-4a Control Scope
Control scope is “the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope
and managing changes to the scope baseline.”19 Ideally, project managers and teams
practice scope control in a proactive manner. They attempt to understand what might
cause changes to either the product scope (the features of the project deliverables) or
the project scope (the work that must be done to create the deliverables). Once a project
team discovers something that may cause a need to change the scope, their first effort is
typically to head it off. It is easiest if the stakeholders can still be satisfied and project
objectives can be met by not changing the scope. However, many times it is necessary
to make a scope change. A scope change is “any change to the project scope. A scope
change almost always requires an adjustment to the project cost or schedule.”20 For this
reason, proposed scope changes are processed through the integrated change control sys-
tem to determine what impact each might have on other aspects of the project. Some
scope changes start as proposed changes to cost or schedule, just as some changes to
cost or schedule start as proposed scope changes.
Just as for any type of proposed change, to understand scope changes, one must have
a scope baseline. That is, the approved scope definition and work breakdown structure
must be clearly understood. Only then can the project team determine how big a
400
Part 3 Performing Projects

proposed scope change is, what impact it will have, and how to best manage it. Variance
analysis is “a technique for determining the cause and degree of difference between the
baseline and actual performance.”21 Variance analysis includes determining how large
the difference is between the actual and planned scope (or schedule or budget), the rea-
sons for the difference, and whether action is necessary to resolve it. For scope variances,
the action can include updating the scope definition and work breakdown structure.
14-4b Control Schedule and Costs
Schedule and cost control are very similar in concept to control in other knowledge
areas. The project manager should start with the approved cost and schedule baseline.
Next, the current status of the schedule and cost should be determined.
If the schedule or budget has changed by at least a pre-agreed amount, changes
should be formally recommended and managed through the integrated change control
system to ensure that any impacts on other areas are taken into account. Cost control
often has one additional consideration—that is, ensuring that no more money is spent
than the amount authorized. This may force other changes on the project, such as delay-
ing the schedule or reducing part of the project scope. While many methods exist for
controlling cost and schedule, the two discussed in this chapter are earned value manage-
ment and project scheduling software such as MS Project.
Very often, the project manager must work with his or her company’s finance depart-
ment or CFO to get the proper data on accounts payable, accounts receivable, and other
information. The project may require someone skilled in financial software. If the project
manager is not personally adept at using such software, someone from the finance
department might be included as part of the project team either in a core team member
or SME capacity.
14-4c Earned Value Management for Controlling
Schedule and Costs
Earned value management is “a methodology that combines scope, schedule, and
resource measurements to assess project performance and progress.”22 Earned value allows
a project team to understand their project’s progress in terms of cost and schedule as well
as to make predictions concerning the project’s schedule and cost control until the project’s
conclusion. Earned value is used as a decision-making tool. The project manager can
quickly assess how the project is doing according to the baseline plan and whether the proj-
ect will end without major cost and/or schedule impacts. The earned value data allow a
project manager to decide on the status of his or her project at a given point in time.
When interpreting earned value management, cost and schedule must be considered
independently. A project can be either ahead or behind the planned schedule and either
over or under the planned budget. Secondly, all earned value terms deal with one of two
time frames. Each represents either current status as of the last date that project data
were gathered or a prediction for the end of the project. Exhibit 14.16 lists 11 questions
and answers that introduce all of the earned value management terms.
Exhibit 14.17 shows with an example each of the earned value management terms.
Currently known values for the example are stated below followed by their definitions.
Variances, indexes, and estimates are next defined and calculations for the example are
shown.
CURRENTLY KNOWN VALUES In this example, the first several items are provided.
PV ¼ $250;000; EV ¼ $200;000; AC ¼ $400;000; and BAC ¼ $750;000
Each of these terms also has a formal definition.
Chapter 14 Determining Project Progress and Results
401

Planned value (PV) is “the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work.”23 In our
example, we expected to spend $250,000 for the work we planned to have accomplished by
now.
Earned value (EV) is “the measure of work performed expressed in terms of budget
authorized for that work.”24 In our example, the work that has been completed is worth
$200,000.
Actual cost (AC) is the “the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an
activity during a specific time period.”25 In our example, we actually owe $400,000 for
the work that has been completed.
Budget at completion (BAC) is “the sum of all budgets established for the work to be
performed.”26 In this example, our approved budget for the entire project is $750,000.
Now that we know these four pieces of information, we can calculate answers to all of
the remaining questions listed in Exhibit 14.16.
VARIANCES Schedule variance (SV) is “a measure of schedule performance expressed
as the difference between the earned value (EV) and the planned value (PV).”27 In our

example, it is calculated as $200,000 – $250,000 = –$50,000. We know we are behind
schedule because the variation is negative (unfavorable).
SV ¼ EV – PV
Cost variance (CV) is “the amount of budget deficit or surplus as a given point in
time, expressed as the difference between earned value (EV) and actual cost (AC).”28 In
our example, it is calculated as $200,000 – $400,000 = –$200,000.
CV ¼ EV – AC
We know we are over budget because the variation is negative (unfavorable). The two
variances help us understand in dollar terms how poorly or well we are performing on cost
and schedule. In this example, we are performing poorly in terms of both cost and schedule.
These are commonly used indicators. However, some people prefer to use efficiency
measures to understand in percentage terms how well or poorly the project is performing.
INDEXES Schedule performance index (SPI) is “a measure of schedule efficiency
expressed as the ratio of earned value (EV) to planned value (PV).”29 In our example,
it is calculated by $200,000/$250,000 = 80%.
SPI ¼ EV=PV
We know our project is behind schedule because we only accomplished 80 percent of
what we planned. With performance indexes, 100 percent means right on plan, less than
100 percent means less efficient than planned, and over 100 percent means more effi-
cient than planned.
Cost performance index (CPI) is “a measure of cost efficiency of budgeted resources
expressed as the ratio of earned value (EV) to actual cost (AC).”30 In our example, it is
calculated by $200,000/$400,000 = 50%.

We know our project is over budget because we have only received $0.50 worth of
results for every dollar we have spent.
Now that we understand how we have performed so far (poorly in our example),
it is time to forecast how we will perform for the remainder of the project. The sim-
plest way to estimate future performance is to predict that past performance will
continue. The following calculations are based upon that assumption. There are pro-
jects, however, that may have unusual circumstances in the early stages that are not
likely to be repeated later. In those instances, the project manager and sponsor need
to use judgment to determine if the original estimates for the remaining work or
some other method of estimating it are better predictors. In each case, an estimate
is made for the remaining work and added to the actual cost of work completed to
provide the overall estimate. We will use the two most common methods of estimat-
ing the remaining work.
ESTIMATES Estimate to complete (ETC) is “the expected cost needed to finish all
the remaining project work.”31 In our example, if we predict that our future
performance will have the same efficiency as our past performance, it is calculated by
(BAC–EV) = CPI ¼ ($750;000 – $200;000) =50% ¼ $1;100;000:
First method (Work to date is good estimate of future) ETC = (BAC – EV)/CPI
Unless we improve upon our efficiency, we can expect to pay more for the remaining
project work than we originally expected to pay for the entire project!
The second method of calculating the ETC is to believe that the original plan is a bet-
ter predictor than the work to date (maybe because of unusual circumstances that are
unlikely to continue). This method is calculated by budget at completion (BAC) – EV =
$750,000 – 200,000 = $550,000.
Second method (original plan is good estimate of future) ETC = BAC – EV
Estimate at completion (EAC) is “the expected total cost of completing all work
expressed as the sum of actual cost to date and the estimate to complete.”32 In our
example, if we believe our efficiency to date is a good predictor of the future, it is calcu-
lated by $400,000 + $1,100,000 = $1,500,000. On the other hand, if we believe what hap-
pened so far will not be repeated and our original plan is good for the remaining work, it
is calculated by $400,000 + $550,000 = $950,000.
EAC ¼ AC + ETC
Because our cost efficiency is only half of our plan (as we learned from our CPI),
unless we become more efficient, we can expect to pay double our original estimate!
Even if we match our original plan for the rest of the project, we will still be way over
budget in the end. Perhaps our sponsor still wants to know what it would take for us to
finish on budget.
The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is “a measure of the cost performance
that is required to be achieved… to finish the outstanding work to the remaining
budget.”33 This is the ratio of the remaining work to the remaining budget and on our
example is calculated as ($750,000 – $200,000)/($750,000 – $400,000) = 157%. That means
so far our cost efficiency as measured by our CPI is 50% and we need to suddenly raise it
to 157% for the remainder of the project to complete on budget! Our sponsor is likely to
be hard to convince.
TCPI ¼ (BAC – EV) / (BAC – AC)

Part 3 Performing Projects

In earned value management, each term helps project managers understand a bit
more about their project’s performance. Collectively, the earned value management
terms give project managers great added insight for monitoring and controlling project
cost and schedule. In addition to earned value management, many project managers use
scheduling software to help control their projects.
14-5 Using MS Project to Monitor and Control Projects
MS Project and other software are primarily helpful in monitoring and controlling the
project schedule, cost, and resources. Some companies prefer to use other software for
parts of this—particularly cost control. In using MS Project for project control, it is help-
ful to understand the following three items:
1. What makes a schedule useful
2. How MS Project recalculates the schedule based upon reported actuals
3. The current and future impacts of time and cost variances
Once these three items are understood, the project manager is prepared to define the
performance update process that will be used and to update the MS Project schedule in a
step-by-step fashion.
14-5a What Makes a Schedule Useful?
A project manager must provide useful status reports, produce accurate assignment
dates, take timely corrective actions, and make other necessary management deci-
sions. This is difficult or impossible to do well without a sufficiently useful
schedule.
To be sufficiently useful, three sets of data must exist for comparison purposes. Each
set includes dates, duration, work, and cost. Approved changes (scope, risk response
activities, corrective action within contingency, management reserve limits, etc.) must
be included. The three sets are as follows:
1. The Baseline set (Baseline Start, Baseline Finish, Baseline Duration, Baseline Work,
and Baseline Cost)—This set is a copy of the stakeholder-approved scheduled
values (as discussed in Chapter 11). This baseline information is sometimes called
the planned schedule.
2. Past actual time and cost results, or the Actual set (Actual Start, Actual Finish,
Actual Duration, Actual Work, and Actual Cost)—This set, sometimes called
performance data, is what actually happens as reported by the resources assigned to
activities.
3. Future estimated time and costs, or the Scheduled set (Start, Finish, Duration,
Work, and Cost fields)—These values are used or calculated by MS Project.
They are continuously recalculated as activities and estimates are entered, as
the project network is defined, as resources are assigned and balanced, and as
actuals are entered.
14-5b How MS Project Recalculates the Schedule
Based on Reported Actuals
As actual data are entered into an activity’s Actual fields, MS Project copies those data
into the activity’s Scheduled fields, replacing the estimated values. MS Project then recal-
culates the schedule for future activities based on a combination of what actually hap-
pened and the estimates of the remaining activities.
Chapter 14 Determining Project Progress and Results
405

14-5c Current and Future Impacts of Time and Cost Variance
With the three sets of data, comparisons can now be made between any two of the sets.
This is useful in understanding future impacts of various issues, such as:
•
Time and cost performance variances from baseline
•
Critical path changes
•
Resource allocation issues
•
Emerging risks
•
Remaining contingency and management reserves
•
The impacts of proposed changes
14-5d Define the Performance Update Process
The performance update process is defined by stating who needs to report, what is in
each report, when each report needs to be filed, and how each report is submitted.
WHO REPORTS? All team members and suppliers assigned to activities that were
scheduled during the past reporting period need to report. Also, any resource wanting
to change the estimate of a soon-to-be-starting activity must report the new estimate.
WHAT IS REPORTED? Actual Start, Actual Finish, Actual Duration Complete, and
Estimated Remaining Duration are reported. Estimated Remaining Duration is one of
the two most important values collected, the other being Actual Finish. The sooner the
project manager learns of variances from estimates, the sooner he or she can take correc-
tive action.
WHEN TO REPORT? Publish the day of the week (Status Date or As of Date) for
reporting, as well as the frequency. The Status Date is usually driven by the date of the
stakeholder review meeting and the time needed to make adjustments before that meet-
ing. The best available data are needed for that meeting.
HOW TO REPORT? Team members on active activities need a request for performance
data. The project manager provides each team member the list of their current assign-
ments together with any previously reported Actuals—Start, Completed Duration, and
Remaining Duration—for those assignments.
The time that performance data are entered is also a good time to make necessary
modifications such as approved changes, risk response activities, revised estimates, roll-
ing wave detail, resource balancing, corrective action, and so forth.
14-5e Steps to Update the Project Schedule
The process of updating the project schedule includes six steps. Each step is described
below and several screen shots from Microsoft Project are displayed to demonstrate.
STEP 1: ACQUIRE THE PERFORMANCE DATA
These are duration-based data. For each
resource assignment, collect the date when the assignment started, how much duration is now
completed, how much duration remains, and the actual finish date (if finished).
STEP 2: DISPLAY THE STATUS DATE LINE ON THE GANTT CHART On the Task
tab, View group, Gantt Chart button, Right click on the Gantt graphic, then select
Gridlines.
In the Line to change list, select Status Date. Then select the dashed line from

Resource R5 reports that Activity E started one day late.
1. Click on Activity E.
2. On the Task tab, in the Schedule group, click the Mark on Track drop-down and
then click Update Tasks.
3. In the Update Tasks dialog, enter “2/4/2014” in Start:, enter “3d” in Actual dur:,
and enter “Od” in Remaining Dur:.
4. Click OK.
5. Notice that Activity E is marked as complete.
Resources R6 and R7 report that no work was done on Activity F.
STEP 5: RESCHEDULE REMAINING WORK Activities D and F have work that is still
scheduled for dates prior to the Status date. This work must be moved to start no earlier
than the day following the Status date.
1. Click on Activity D.
2. On the Project tab, Status group, click on Update Project.
3. In the Update Project dialog, click Reschedule uncompleted work to start after:.
4. Enter the Status Date if not already entered.
5. Click on Selected tasks.
6. Repeat these steps for Activity F.
Activity D is now split, with the completed work showing on Monday and Tuesday,
and the remaining work rescheduled to resume on Friday. If a more likely date to
resume work is not Friday, drag and drop the Gantt bar to resume on the likely date.
Activity F is also scheduled to resume on Friday. When all of an activity is resched-
uled, a start-no-earlier constraint is applied by project. Modify that constraint to select a
more likely resume date. Ignoring unfinished work that is scheduled earlier than the sta-
tus date is a risky practice. This rescheduling is shown in Exhibit 14.24.
STEP 6: REVISE FUTURE ESTIMATES The most accurate estimates are often
those made just before an activity has started. Therefore, it is a good practice to ask all proj-
ect team members if they believe the estimates for any of their activities should be updated.
14-6 Replanning if Necessary
Sometimes it becomes necessary to replan a project. Certainly, the project manager can
use the integrated change control system to understand the impact the proposed changes

may have and to secure approval to make the change. The changes are then reflected in a
revised plan. The schedule, cost, and resource changes can be shown on an updated MS
Project schedule. Other changes can be reflected in risk register updates or issues log
updates. Two questions still exist regarding replanning: “What kinds of changes might
be made in response to the problems?” and “Does the approval for a change need to be
escalated to higher management?”
Changes a project manager may need to recommend include reassigning activities to
different workers, splitting activities so at least some work can get started, reordering
activities so they may be accomplished sooner, borrowing or acquiring additional
resources, reducing scope, and so on. Many of these types of change can help a project
get back on track; however, make sure the appropriate stakeholders agree with the
changes, because many times a change that improves one aspect of a project degrades
another.
Consider that people at each level in an organization have the ability to make specific
decisions and are generally allowed a certain amount of time to deal with a problem
before notifying a superior. Whoever makes the decision is still expected to document it
appropriately. If a very minor problem occurs on a project, perhaps a team member can
make the decision regarding how to handle it. A bit larger problem may fall in the
domain of the project manager. Large decisions may go to the sponsor, and really critical
decisions may be sent to the leadership of the parent organization. Escalation answers
the question of what kinds of decisions are submitted to a higher level and how much
time the lower-level person gets before raising the problem. A person who escalates
minor decisions, or even major decisions very quickly, gives the impression of being weak
and indecisive. However, a person who does not escalate important decisions or who takes
so long to escalate them that the problem has worsened exhibits poor judgment.
Summary
For a project manager to effectively determine that
the desired project progress is being made and
results are being delivered, a multitude of things
need to be monitored and controlled. Many of these
are interdependent, so a project manager needs to
understand how changes in one area might impact
another area.
Project managers need to monitor and control the
actual work of the project, or the activities. This
entails observing the work as it is executed and mak-
ing adjustments as needed. Any adjustments that
may
have
a
sizable
impact
must
be
processed
through the project’s integrated change control pro-
cess. Each potential change is proposed, approved or
disapproved, and documented, and the approved
changes are implemented. A risk register is main-
tained to keep track of active risks, whether the
risk events transpire, and how they are handled.
New
risks
are
added
as
discovered,
and
no-longer-relevant risks are retired.
Project managers also need to control the various
aspects of the project that are subject to potential trade-
offs—namely, scope, quality, cost, and schedule. When
controlling these, the project manager remembers to
look for variances—that is, any difference between
what was planned and what has actually happened.
The project manager also seeks to understand how a
change in any one will impact the others. Several tools
exist for helping project managers with this control.
Many quality control tools are widely used when seek-
ing to understand what the quality level is, where pro-
blems may exist, what the root causes are for problems,
and how to improve the project processes so the pro-
blems do not reoccur. Sponsors and other stakeholders
want to understand progress made on the project, cur-
rent plans, and what might derail the project. Regular
progress meetings and reports serve this purpose.
Earned value management and MS Project are both
quite helpful in understanding, documenting, and im-
proving upon cost and schedule progress.

Controlling, Monitoring, and Reporting Projects at a Major Medical Center
The Emergency Medicine Division of Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center typically has a large
number of active quality improvement projects that
require effective control, monitoring, and reporting.
Division leadership aims for three levels of effective
monitoring and control and reporting:
1. Team-level monitoring: Self-monitoring progress
against process and outcome measures at daily,
weekly, or monthly intervals.
2. Division-level monitoring: Main outcome and select
process measures reported to division leaders who
can then guide and support teams as needed.
3. Institutional-level monitoring: Main outcome
measure progress followed and presented along
with other projects to institutional leadership and
other stakeholder groups.
An essential part of effective monitoring is the
development of a well-defined aim. Each aim is
associated with a primary outcome measure, and is
supported by process measures. For the divisions
strategic flow project, the primary aim was a reduction
in the length of stay for patients and was supported by
process measures representing specific intervals of this
time, such as time from arrival in the department to
being seen by a physician and time from being able to
leave the department to actually leaving.
Team-level monitoring
Team-level monitoring functions in slightly different
ways from those of the other two levels. On the
ground, the feedback loop for evaluating tests needs to
be nimble and timely. Rather than using a single
outcome measure to gauge progress, teams utilize a
number of process measures, the collection of which
typically represents the main identified outcome
measure of a given project. Process measures are
tracked frequently as the teams conduct tests
within the system and during the course of a
project are often displayed in daily, weekly, and
monthly formats. Ad hoc analysis supplements these
416
Part 3 Performing Projects

measures, particularly for tests that are run for discrete
periods of time.
At this level, changes are tested for short periods of
time. Individual tests are evaluated using process
measures, often the daily variants of the measure or ad
hoc analysis are employed, particularly in the first 3–6
months of a project or during intensive periods of
testing. Teams meet weekly and discuss tests, adapting,
adopting, or abandoning tests as they are evaluated.
Weekly charts are used to minimize the noise of day-
to-day variance, and teams monitor these over time.
Monthly charts are used to view larger trends over time
and are more important in months 6–12 as changes are
implemented and systems experience this change for
longer periods of time. An example measure used by a
team is shown in Exhibit 14.25.
Division-level monitoring
Individual teams organize work into 90-day blocks for
planning, execution, and reporting purposes. Teams
formally report after each 90-day cycle to a group of
senior leaders using a pre-established reporting
template. Team presentations typically last 20 minutes
and include data reporting in the form of annotated run
charts for all key performance measures. Teams share
special challenges and seek guidance on issues
blocking progress. Teams also share goals, work plans,
and predictions of key measure progress for the next
90-day cycle. A formal leadership letter follows each
team presentation summarizing key discussion points
and action items.
High-level reporting structure and
management (Macro)
At the highest level, individual team progress is
displayed on a department-wide dashboard.
Aggregating each individual measure across all
projects, this dashboard is designed to provide
visibility to department leads, institutional
stakeholders, and hospital leadership on the progress

Finishing the Project and Realizing
the Benefits
After managing a number of projects to successful completion, it wasn’t until
I was overseeing a project in Trinidad and Tobago that I fully realized the
importance the project team celebrating its success.
Trinidad and Tobago is the southernmost Caribbean Island, seven miles
off the coast of Venezuela. The client company, Trinmar Limited, was formed
as a joint venture between Texaco and Petrotrin, wholly owned by the
government. Texaco had recently sold its equity share in Trinmar, leaving
state-owned Petrotrin to produce 35,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil per day.
Many of the rigs inherited by Trinmar were over 25 years old and
declining in production. In addition to building a new organization and
strategy, Trinmar faced the difficult decision of whether to upgrade existing
rigs or invest in building new rigs.
Our consulting team quickly identified over 80 potential projects. Working
closely with the executive team, we were able to facilitate a portfolio
optimization process to establish the strategic criteria and help Trinmar

evaluate, prioritize, and make decisions regarding each project. The company
invested in only a few new capital projects, while focusing on monthly well
output and proactive preventative maintenance, resulting in an overall increase
in production.
Flying in from Miami to discuss the final steps of the project closing
process, I was greeted at the airport by the company driver offering a gift
bag. Inside was a polo shirt with a company logo, and a card.
The day was spent in semi-formal meetings with company executives and
the portfolio team. We presented and discussed the culmination of customer
reviews that had been conducted throughout the project—customer feedback,
areas for improvement, lessons learned, project results, and approval of the
final deliverables.
The evening had a much different tone, with live music, local delicacies, and
drinks flowing freely. All of the company executives and their spouses, were
joined by everyone associated with the project. Several team members brought
relatives, including cousins. Partway into the evening, the CEO stood and made
an announcement, describing the project success and complementing our
partnership. He personally recognized everyone associated with the project.
Each team member received an award of accomplishment and had their
picture taken with the CEO Before he left, the CEO pulled me aside and said,
“Mr. Miller, on behalf of our company and country, we sincerely thank you for
hosting us with this generous celebration.”
When I arrived back at the hotel early the next morning after settling the
evening’s bill, I saw the gift bag and finally opened the card. “Mr. Bruce Miller
cordially invites you and your guest to join us in a celebration of our project
success,” it read.
It was only later that I was sheepishly advised by one of my fellow
consultants that he had offered to have our company sponsor the celebration,
and did not have the chance to tell me in advance. But the true impact of the
celebration—reflected in the sincere joy and pride of the project team members
as they received the sincere thanks of their CEO—had already proven the value
of the event.

Projects are often started with great
enthusiasm.
They
serve
as
vehicles
to
accomplish
important
organizational
objectives. Many things happen during the
course of a project that may impact its
success. Regardless of the level of success
achieved by the project, going out on a
strong note is good for everyone involved.
A project moves into the closing stage
when its customers validate that the scope is
complete and accept the project deliverables.
Aprojectcancloseasplannedorbeterminated
early. In either event, closing activities include
securing customer feedback and approval,
planning and conducting a smooth transition
of project deliverables to a client or into
ongoing operations, capturing and sharing
lessons learned, performing administrative
closure, celebrating success, and providing
ongoing support.
When purchasing a new home, buyers and a builder’s
representative do a “walk through” to inspect the
finished product and discuss mechanical functions and
features of the home.
15-1 Validate Scope
Validate scope is “the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project
deliverables.”1 Stakeholders validate that scope is complete with interim deliverables
throughout the project and with final deliverables near the end. When the stakeholders for-
mally accept the final project deliverables, the project finishes the executing stage and pro-
ceeds into the closing and realizing stages. To illustrate, imagine you have contracted with
a construction company to build a new home. Before you close on the house, you want to
make sure the house has been properly finished. Therefore, the common practice is to have
a “walk through” where as a customer you literally walk through the house with a repre-
sentative from the building company. The representative points out features and describes
how things work. You try light switches, look at the finish, and consider all of the things
you wanted (and agreed to pay for) in the house. Often, a few little things are not yet
finished, and these can form a “punch list” of items to complete. If the punch list is small
enough, as a customer you agree to formally take possession of the house subject to the
contractor finishing the punch list items. Once you formally agree the work is complete
and agree to take possession, the house becomes an accepted deliverable.
However, if there are major concerns and/or a long punch list, you may decide not to
formally accept the house until certain things are complete. Most projects are like this:
The customer only formally accepts the deliverables once he or she is convinced they
will work as planned. At that point, the buyer provides the seller with a formal written
acceptance, and the project transitions from the executing stage to the closing stage.
Project managers need to ensure that all work on their project has been successfully
completed. They can refer back to the charter, scope statement, WBS, schedule, and all
communications plans to verify that everything they said they would do is actually
done. Many organizations also use project closeout checklists that itemize typical project
activities and/or deliverables. These can be used to assign responsibility to each item
concerning project closeout. An example of a project closeout checklist is shown in
Exhibit 15.1.

15-2 Close Procurements
Close procurements is “the process of completing each procurement.”2 In some organi-
zations, particularly government organizations, a formal procurement audit is conducted
on large projects. This is to ensure that tax money is spent correctly. While the formality
may be less on smaller and nongovernmental projects, the concept of a procurement
audit is still valid. Someone in the parent organization (often not the project manager)
verifies that proper methods were used for all purchasing and that all contracts have
been successfully completed. Actually closing the contracts includes confirming that all
deliverables were accepted, all money has been properly distributed and accounted for,
and all property has been returned.
15-2a Terminate Projects Early
Ideally, all projects continue until successful conclusion, with all deliverables meeting
specifications and pleasing customers. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes,
a project is terminated before its normal completion. Early termination can be by mutual
agreement between the contractor and buyer, because one of the parties has defaulted
(for cause), or for convenience of the buyer.
MUTUAL AGREEMENTS On some projects, by close-out, not all of the deliverables are
yet completed. Remaining deliverables need to be integrated into another project,
stopped altogether, or continued as a lesser project or a further phase of the finishing
project. If both parties agree to stop the project before its planned completion, a negoti-
ated settlement may take place. If some of the deliverables or documentation is not com-
pleted, the project manager may need to negotiate with the customer. Perhaps the
customer would rather have most of the capability now rather than all of it later. The
project team may have made a larger-than-expected breakthrough in one area and can
negotiate with the customer to deliver more in that area and less in another. Ideally
both parties agree what deliverables or partial deliverables go to the buyer, what compen-
sation goes to the seller, and any outstanding issues are resolved. If agreement cannot be
reached by direct negotiations, either courts or alternative dispute resolution can be used
to reach a settlement. Perhaps it is in all parties’ best interest to finish the project as is
and part as friends.
TERMINATIONS FOR DEFAULT Terminations for default often result from a problem
with the project’s cost, schedule, or performance. A buyer can also decide to terminate
a project early because he or she has lost confidence in the contractor who is perform-
ing the project. Good project management practices consistently applied throughout
the project can lessen the chance of early termination for cause by managing
stakeholder expectations and by delivering what customers want on spec, on time,
and on budget.
TERMINATIONS FOR CONVENIENCE OF BUYER Projects can also be cancelled for
the convenience of the buyer. This can happen through no fault of the contractor. Some-
times, the buyer faces unexpected difficulties or changing priorities. If a customer’s needs
change, it might decide that the resources assigned to a project could be more profitably
applied to a different project. If a customer decides to terminate a project for conve-
nience, it invokes a contract clause. This clause normally stipulates that the contractor
is reimbursed for the money it has spent up to that point and the customer takes owner-
ship of the deliverables in whatever form they currently exist.
Project managers can pursue two avenues to possibly head off early termination. First, a
project manager who has been serious about managing stakeholder relationships may be able
424
Part 3 Performing Projects

to find other stakeholders in the customer organization or elsewhere who can provide some
funds to keep the project viable—even if it has to be reduced. Second, the project manager
can look internally to find ways of continuing with the project, but at lower cost.
Project managers serve as the strongest advocates for their projects throughout the
project’s life. Considering that most projects face many challenges, this unwavering sup-
port is often critical to project success. However, when a project is no longer needed or
no longer viable, project managers owe honest and timely communication to their parent
organization. Project managers need to present the facts of project progress and make
recommendations for early termination if they feel it is warranted.
If a decision is made to terminate a project early, the project manager owes it to his
or her team to communicate quickly and honestly. Let the team know as soon as possible
and tell them exactly why the decision was made. Care must be taken to ensure that no
unjust blame is placed. It is absolutely unethical to have reputations and careers suffer
for a termination where the impacted party was not at fault. Once a decision is made
and communicated to terminate a project early, much of the remaining work is similar
to that for a project that finishes as planned.
15-3 Close Project
As stated in Chapter 1, closing a project entails finalizing all activities needed to finish
the project. The remainder of this chapter details what a project team does when finish-
ing a project on time. Customers are asked both to accept the project deliverables and to
provide feedback. Lessons learned are captured and shared. Contracts are closed. Partici-
pants are reassigned and rewarded. Reports are created and archived. Success is cele-
brated, and the project team ensures that customers receive the ongoing support they
need to successfully use the project deliverables.
A few key challenges arise at the end of projects. One is to keep the right workers
engaged until project completion. Some of the final activities are administrative. Often,
new projects are starting up that are more exciting.
15-3a Write Transition Plan
A project manager may decide to create a transition plan to help the customer success-
fully use the project deliverables. Project transition plans are a sort of instruction manual
on how the customer should use the project deliverables once the project team has com-
pleted its work.
The reason a project is performed is that some person or organization wants to be able to
use the resulting deliverables. Some project deliverables are created by one group and turned
over to another group. Sometimes the group performing the project also uses the results. In
either case, a transition plan can ensure that all responsibilities are considered and all deliver-
ables—whether complete or not—are given with appropriate documentation to the people
who will use them. If any activities remain incomplete when the deliverables are transitioned,
they should be itemized, and responsibility for each should be clearly identified. For example,
if a home buyer wanted to close on a house before everything is complete, a punch list of re-
maining items would be determined, and the contractor would agree to complete them. A
brief transition plan is shown in the Project Management in Action feature at the end of this
chapter. A transition plan helps to ensure:
•
Quality problems are avoided during the transition.
•
The project deliverables transition into their service or operational role.
•
The needed maintenance, upgrades, and training take place.3

15-3b Knowledge Management
The fourth area identified in using the balanced score card approach to controlling
and improving projects is growth and innovation. While the portion of this per-
taining to team development is covered in Chapter 13, the portion concerning
knowledge management is covered here. Knowledge management should occur
throughout the project life, but it may be most apparent as a project comes to a
close. Project customers, whether internal or external to a company, can provide
valuable feedback concerning both the project process and results. Ask them what
they think! Exhibit 15.2 is a simple form for asking project customers for their
opinions.

CAPTURE LESSONS LEARNED Lessons learned are the useful knowledge gained by
project team members as they perform a project and then reflect on both the process of
doing the work and the results that transpired. Lessons can include what worked well
that the project team members think should be copied and/or adapted for use on future
work. Lessons can also include areas for which a different method may yield better
results. The project meeting Plus-Delta evaluation template shown in Exhibit 5.14 is an
example of capturing lessons learned at the end of a project meeting. Lessons can also be
captured at milestones and at the end of a project. On long-duration projects, it is often
better to capture lessons frequently because people may not remember clearly what hap-
pened months previously. Therefore, most project managers capture lessons learned
early and often. A project manager may wish to capture lessons learned first from the
core project team and then from all of the stakeholders.
The first step in capturing project-end lessons learned is for the project manager to
send an e-mail asking the participants to identify major project issues. Then, the actual
meeting begins with each participant writing his or her top issues on a flip chart or other
work space where everyone can see them. Once all participants have listed their top
issues, the entire group can vote on the top 5 (or perhaps top 10 on a large project).
Then the project manager can go through one top issue at a time by asking leading ques-
tions to determine what went wrong and how it might be avoided in future projects.
Likewise, the participants can list significant successes on the project and discuss what
caused each. They can then ask what practices can be used to re-create similar successes
on future projects.
Some organizations use a standard form for capturing project lessons learned such as
the one shown in Exhibit 15.3.
DISSEMINATE AND USE LESSONS LEARNED The process of capturing and discuss-
ing lessons learned is valuable learning for the participants. However, for the remainder
of the organization to capitalize on those lessons, a method must be established for doc-
umenting and sharing the lessons. More organizations effectively collect lessons learned
than effectively disseminate and use them. One problem is deciding how to store the les-
sons so all workers in a company can easily access them. Some companies have created
databases, shared folders, or wikis for this purpose. Many companies that do a good job
with lessons learned have one person assigned to “own” the lessons learned database.
Every project team that collects lessons then sends the new lessons to this “owner,”
who compares the new lessons with existing lessons and decides whether to modify,
combine, or add the lessons. In this manner, the database only grows when unique and
useful new lessons are added. Another idea used by some companies is to have the per-
son who submitted each lesson list her cell phone number and e-mail so another person
considering the lesson can contact her to ask questions.
Coding each lesson by type of project, stage in project life cycle, issue it concerns, and so on
helps future project teams when they search for new lessons to apply. Many organizations find
that it is helpful to have a limited number of categories and have each lesson stored according
to the category in which it best fits. The ten PMBOK® Guide knowledge areas can be a useful
starting point when determining useful categories. Exhibit 15.4 shows 13 categories used by a
company along with a couple of lessons in each category.
Another problem is that most people are busy and do not seek lessons learned just for
fun. One way to overcome this is for sponsors to only sign charters if lessons from other
recently completed projects are included. That forces project teams to consider what
lessons they can use. Some lessons learned are more effectively transferred by informal
means such as conversations, unscheduled meetings, or having a project team member
also serve as a team member on another project. An organization that seriously uses a
Chapter 15 Finishing the Project and Realizing the Benefits
427

lessons learned process makes continual improvements in its project management
processes. The best lessons learned are only of value if they are used!
Closure of a project entails ensuring that all work has been accomplished, all
resources have been reassigned, and all documentation is complete. The project manager
and team can review the project charter, WBS, and schedule to make sure that
everything that was promised was delivered. They can review the issues log and risk

LESSONS LEARNED EXAMPLE
ACCOUNTABILITY:
Use formal accountability and measurement systems down to the individual performance level.
Ensure all team members have clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
BUY-IN AND COMMITMENT:
It is helpful when directors attend project meetings.
Be sure sponsor secures buy-in from other executives.
Involve people with decision-making authority early in the project.
COMMUNICATION:
Develop and follow a communications management plan to develop trust.
Communication about change needs to be ongoing.
Communication needs to be early and ongoing with all key audiences and stakeholders.
COMPLEXITY:
Many projects are multi-faceted and involve numerous tradeoffs that need to be managed.
Project manager should attend some client meetings and sponsor should attend some team
meetings to ensure integration.
CULTURE AND CHANGE:
Lean concepts challenge the organization’s culture for data collection and transparency.
Commitment to transparency and change is needed prior to project initiation.
Educating leaders in change management strategies helps them deal with resistance.
EXPECTATIONS:
Set and state clear expectations.
Define and stay within scope.
Manage expectations of sponsor, stakeholders, customers, and project team.
MEETINGS:
Team members will be prepared with previous meeting minutes, agenda, and project updates.
End a meeting with clear action items and due dates for each team member.
Plan meetings in advance to make them more efficient.
PLANNING:
Have well-defined roles and responsibilities.
Scale planning at the appropriate level of detail.
Expect many revisions.
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT:
Always discuss what we could have done better.
Keep working to sustain results on completed projects.
Investigate feedback provided to assure it is understood and utilized as appropriate.
PROJECT TEAM:
Listen to and respect input from all team members.
Let each team member be responsible for setting his or her own timetable to the extent possible.
Determine in advance how project team will make decisions.
SCOPE:
Define success early.
Be specific about scope.
Manage scope creep.

15-3c Create the Closeout Report
Many organizations have formal procedures for closeout reports and archiving project
records. The closeout report usually includes a summary status of the project that can
be gleaned from progress reports. The closeout report also normally includes lessons
learned. Finally, the closeout report often contains a review of the project’s original jus-
tification. Did the project accomplish what it was originally approved to do? This is an
important question because many projects change along the line. The exact timing,
costs, and deliverables may have changed, but did the project still accomplish its goals?
Finally, the project manager needs to ensure that the records are in a workable format
and stored in a manner that will allow others in the organization access for lessons
learned, financial audits, or other uses.
Organizations often create templates for closeout reports such as the one in
Exhibit 15.5.
15-4 Post-Project Activities
15-4a Reassign Workers
Project managers owe the members of their team timely updates for their personnel
records, honest recommendations, and help securing their next assignments, and
rapid notification of any issues. Wise project managers know it is not just ethical to treat
their members well; if a project manager develops a reputation for taking good care of
team members, it becomes much easier to recruit team members for future projects.
Helping good workers secure follow-on work is one of the most important things a proj-
ect manager must do near the end of a project. Many of these workers will be eager to
work again for that project manager and will tell others of their good experience.
15-4b Celebrate Success and Reward Participants
The successful conclusion of a project should be celebrated for many reasons. Perhaps
one way to understand the many reasons is to utilize a play on the very word celebrate.

Ease Stress
When people are reminded of their recent accomplishments, they realize they just met a
large challenge and are motivated to undertake new challenges. The team members are fre-
quently energized to finish the last few administrative chores so they are done. By recognizing
their accomplishments, they are now ready to say “the project is over; we will limit any addi-
tional work on this project.” The team members exert themselves to finish the last few items.
Celebrations can persuade members to believe they can do just a bit more than they might oth-
erwise think is possible. Celebrations are excellent times to recognize and acknowledge both
effort and results. Celebrations mark transition points as people leave one project and move
on to another. Finally, celebrations of success ease the stress of working hard for a prolonged
period of time trying to accomplish a project.
When a primary project deliverable is quite visible, such as a new building, celebrat-
ing right at the project site makes sense. People feel success partly just by observing the
deliverable. When the project deliverables are less visible, project managers can still
create ceremonial deliverables to demonstrate the project results. Project managers may
be able to use specially packaged software, oversized checks, posters of thanks from cus-
tomers, or other creative means of visualizing project results.
15-4c Provide Ongoing Support
Ultimately, a project manager wants to ensure that customers can effectively use the project
deliverables. This may include providing ongoing support in the forms of training, change
management, and/or other services. A transition plan can guide this support. Project man-
agers want to create useful project deliverables on time and on budget. They want to turn
those deliverables over to capable, satisfied customers who will directly provide more project
work in the future and who will enthusiastically tell others how pleased they are.
15-4d Ensure Project Benefits Are Realized
Many organizations insist that project managers follow up with customers weeks or months
after the project deliverables are in use. One of the most important measures of project success
is how well the customers are able to use the deliverables created by the project. When consid-
ering the full impact of the project results, project managers are encouraged to consider use by
direct customers and other stakeholders (people), and also how they contribute to the other
parts of the triple bottom line—profit for the parent company and sustainability of the planet.
15-5 Using MS Project for Project Closure
Just as software such as Microsoft Project can be useful in planning and managing a
project, it can be useful when finishing a project and leveraging the benefits. Specifically,
it is helpful to complete and archive the schedule and to capture lessons learned specific
to the scheduling process.

1. Complete the schedule to maximize its future usefulness. This includes:
•
Applying performance data
•
Applying approved changes
•
Ensuring all activities are complete
2. Archive the schedule for use as a template or “starter” file.
•
Decide the data format—Microsoft Project or a longer-term format
•
Decide which baselines to keep (there could be many if there were many
approved changes)
3. Capture and publish lessons learned about the effectiveness and efficiency of the
employed schedule and cost management processes, such as:
•
Frequency and method of team member performance data collection
•
Activity duration maximum and minimum limits
•
Status reporting to stakeholders
•
Communication technology employed
•

either because the customer is dissatisfied or wishes
to invest their time and money in a different way.
Regardless of whether a project was terminated early
or on time, a variety of closeout procedures is
required. All activities must be completed, money
paid and accounted for, documentation completed
and distributed, workers reassigned and rewarded,
lessons learned recorded, and success celebrated.
A project manager would like to end a project with
team members eager to work for him or her again
and satisfied customers who will either hire the
project manager again or direct other potential cus-
tomers her way by their enthusiastic singing of her
praises.

The Power of Lessons Learned
Projects are discrete. They have a beginning and an
end, at which time the project team disbands and
moves on to other things. Despite the fact there has
inevitably been significant tacit learning during the
project, there is often only a limited capture of this into
a sharable form for future reuse. Too often as the
project team dissolves, the learning fades into the
memories of individuals’ minds. This makes it
extremely difficult for others to benefit in future from
the insights learned. The usual excuses for this loss
echoing through the corridors include “just too hard,”
“not enough time,” “team disbanded before we had
the chance,” and many more. The key error here is the
incorrect assumption that learning during or from
projects is an “added bonus” or a “nice to have
luxury.” This is not the case in best practice
environments.
Those fortunate enough to work on a well led
project will have observed how learning is just part
of how we work together. Experienced and
knowledgeable project leaders understand the value
in capturing lessons learned, as an embedded part
of normal daily activities. They engage the team to
deliberately harness knowledge and highlight
lessons throughout the project to provide insights
and enhance performance (during the project and
beyond). The value of doing this greatly outweighs
the costs of implementation, when it is done well
and there is a culture of trust and collaboration. The
diagram highlights in good projects (traditional or
agile) learning generates a flow of knowledge from
each phase of the project in cycles. This builds the
capabilities of those involved and can form a
knowledge base to be used by the team or by others
in future. In some cases this knowledge base
remains only in the heads of those involved, as
there is no attempt to capture it in explicit form.
This is a mistake, as it is difficult to transfer beyond
the immediate team (although it can be to some
extent if there is a culture of storytelling and low
staff turnover).
There are many barriers to developing an
effective lessons learned knowledge base, and
culture is often the primary villain. If people
involved in the project are not reflective and not
willing to invest a little time to capture and share
their insights, the lessons are not captured. Equally
culture influences the motivation to look at what has
been learned through the discovery process BEFORE
the project starts.
Good projects start with more questions than
answers:
Communication: Cyclic at all stages

Knowledge Projects
Behaviors: Collaboration leadership, Knowledge capture & sharing, Attitude biased towards leverage,
    Seek before reinvent, participative learning, Support for development programs
Learning: Learn Before, During and After. Knowledge: Capture and sharing

Infrastructure: Intranet, Connectivity, Reliability, Performance, Security, Measures

Has this been done before?
Did it work? I so why? If not why?
What has changed since last time? (Something that
did not work before might now—IF the context is
different.)
If we did it the same, would it still work or do we
need to adapt it?
These questions can be effectively answered only IF
there is some access to what was learned previously
and those seeking answers can find it in a convenient
and trusted way. This is why talking to someone you
know and trust, who was actually involved in the prior
project, is always the preferred option. However, in
modern organizations this is becoming increasingly
difficult to achieve because of challenges such as high
use of contracted team members, high employee
mobility, regular restructures incomplete records in
lessons learned systems (which may be poorly
designed), and fast change of supporting technologies.
So what other good options exist?
Some organizations (including NASA and the U.S.
Military) have developed quite sophisticated lessons
learned databases. These are usually supported by
processes that require people to submit comments into
the project systems that will help other people in
future. Over time these “what we know”—based
systems build a large volume of data that can be
interrogated to provide relevant insights when you
need them (hopefully proactively to avert a potential
risk becoming an issue, rather than reactive when the
issue has occurred). These systems work best when
people make it part of their normal work activities to
record BOTH errors and their solutions as well as what
went right and why. Insights of both types are essential
to ongoing success. The danger of rigid processes and
systems is that people do not see the value in recording
something that they believe is for the benefit of
unknown others in future and will not help them (but
costs them precious time). So they either just don’t do
it, or record only very basic, non-specific information
that will not be particularly helpful for someone in a
future context. Some organizations have a “stick”
approach and link recording of quality lessons learned
to performance reviews or project sign offs. Others take
a “carrot” approach and reward those who record
effective lessons learned as judged by other people
who found and applied the lesson.
Another approach used by an international project
management organization is to combine a content-
based system (as described above) and an
understanding of “who knows what.” People seeking
insights can ring a “service desk” with their questions
and the (experienced) employee answering the phone
discusses what it is they need to find out. The service
person can be from a range of backgrounds, such as a
librarian, as semi-retired employee with a long history
of the organization’s projects, a specialist, or a
nominated representative of an internal group such as
a technical committee or community of practice.
Sometimes these people will know the answer, but if
they do not, they can find a person or document that
can guide the seeker. This PM organization records all
questions asked and the relevant resources that helped
the seeker in a database that can be interrogated in
future. This hybrid of tacit and explicit knowledge was
found to be highly effective for fast discovery of ideas.
It enabled good ideas to be quickly applied elsewhere
and helped to prevent reinvention of ideas already
developed in other parts of the organization. It also
enabled the discovery process at the beginning of
projects to reduce repeating of errors from earlier
experiences.

Introduction
The Project Management Professional (PMP®) and
Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM®)
are
globally
recognized
professional
certifications
administered by the leading global project management
professional
group—Project
Management
Institute
(PMI). CAPM® is appropriate for an undergraduate
with limited work experience, and PMP® is appropri-
ate for either a nontraditional undergraduate or an
MBA with three or more years of full-time project
management
experience
or
equivalent.
Both
test
detailed knowledge of the Guide to the Project
Management
Body
of
Knowledge,
Fifth
Edition
(PMBOK® Guide).
General Guidance
You must read through the PMBOK® Guide very care-
fully—every single page. Look up words you do not
know, as some questions are vocabulary, and the cor-
rect answers are from the PMBOK® Guide Glossary.
Put a Post-it Note on page 61 of the PMBOK®
Guide. The inside front cover of Contemporary Project
Management, Third Edition (CPM) shows the exact
pages in which each PMBOK process is covered. It is
a map mirroring page 61 in the fifth edition of the
PMBOK® Guide. Every time you study a new process,
note carefully what process group and knowledge area
it falls in. As you study each process, note the inputs,
tools and techniques, and outputs. Many of the ques-
tions are scenario questions that deal with timing (what
would you do first in a situation). Since the output of
one process is often the input to another process, not-
ing inputs and outputs will help you identify what goes
first or last.
I encourage you to use CPM in conjunction with the
PMBOK® Guide since the latter is the “what” of project
management (essentially a 500+ page encyclopedia of
project management), and CPM is the “how” with
examples. For many people, the explanation of “how”
along with examples makes it much easier to remember
all the detailed “what” that will be tested. Few people
are good at memorizing encyclopedias.
Ten example questions are given at the end of
each chapter of CPM. These were developed by
Thomas F. McCabe, PMP®, Managing Director &
CIO of W. W. Mentorprises, Inc. Tom served on the
fifth edition update committee.
Many people find it useful to go through the
PMBOK® Guide one chapter at a time very carefully
comparing the “what” from the PMBOK® Guide to
the “how” with examples from CPM. I encourage
you to make sure you understand each chapter
well before you continue, but go fairly quickly so
you do not forget the first chapters by the time
you take the exam. The first two chapters are the
project management framework. They correspond
to the first three chapters in CPM.
Always answer questions according to the PMI®
standard process, not the way you would necessarily
do it in your industry or the way an emotional appeal
suggests. If one answer is a general category and other
answers are specific examples, often the correct answer
is the more general one. Choose the answer that is
most right most of the time, not one that is sometimes
right in certain circumstances.
Test Format
There are ten knowledge areas and five process groups
in the fifth edition of the PMBOK® Guide with a total
of 47 individual processes. Know these well!
I suggest you either make a note sheet or flash cards
to study each process. You will not be able to bring a
note sheet to the exam, but you can study it right up to
the moment you begin the exam. You will be given
paper for notes, and you may write as many formulas
as you can remember before you start with the ques-
tions. Many people write down formulas they have a
hard time memorizing so they can study them just
before the exam starts.
Any place in the PMBOK® Guide where you find a
list of three, a question may be “which of the following
is NOT…” . Therefore, when studying inputs, tools and
techniques, or outputs of a particular process, try to
remember anytime there is a list of three items.
439

If a question is long, read the last sentence first. That
is the question, and the rest is the background.
All questions are multiple choice with four possi-
ble answers. Answer all questions as the only thing
that is scored is correct answers. When in doubt—
guess instead of leaving it blank. For each question,
you can answer it and move on, answer it and mark
it to return, or not answer it. I suggest that you
never return to the questions you feel confident
enough to answer without marking. You have four
hours for the PMP® exam and three hours for the
CAPM® exam. In both cases, it should be more than
enough time. You are allowed to go to a rest room,
but the clock keeps going.
PMBOK ® Guide
All ten knowledge areas include one planning pro-
cess in the planning process group. Several include
one managing process in the executing group, and
almost all include one control process in the moni-
toring and controlling process group. Make sure you
understand the subtle differences between the man-
aging
and
controlling
processes
in
groups
that
include both.
Many processes occur in parallel with other pro-
cesses and/or are repetitive. However, some processes
clearly occur before others. Know the order!
Most knowledge areas include quite a bit of vocab-
ulary. You not only want to remember the official
PMBOK® Guide definition, but what each really
means when it is applied. CPM helps with the applica-
tion. All definitions in CPM glossary are taken directly
from the fifth edition of the PMBOK® Guide.
Several knowledge areas refer to audits. In this con-
text, an audit is meant to improve the way work is
performed. Following are a few specific suggestions
for each knowledge area.
The PMBOK® Guide uses the term register for a
repository of information. For example, the stake-
holder register is the recorded information about
project stakeholders—who they are, what they want,
how they are prioritized, and so on. Risks are recorded in
a risk register in a similar fashion. The repository for
issues, on the other hand, is called an issue log. In yet
another repository example, requirements are often
stored in a requirements traceability matrix. In each
case, think of these repositories as living documents
that change with project progress and additional infor-
mation. Know the types of information that each may
include.
Project Integration Management
Integration describes how decisions in one aspect of a
project often impact another area, such as when a change
is proposed, it may impact cost, schedule (time), and
scope. In fact, if a question deals with one of those three
items (such as cost), the correct answer may include the
other two. One way to consider integration is to imagine
a very large project in which different people plan por-
tions and integration is used to make sure the entire plan
makes sense. The last integration process—closing the
project—ends with capturing lessons learned. Develop
project charter is the integration process that occurs dur-
ing initiating. Chapter 4 of CPM is all about writing and
approving the charter.
The first process overall is Develop Project Charter
and the last process overall is Close Project or Phase—
both integration processes. Capturing lessons learned
and archiving or distributing them is the last activity
to be performed as part of project closure.
There may be multiple questions on the project
management plan. This is the umbrella plan with
many subsidiary plans such as budget and schedule.
A plan is baselined at the end of planning when all
parties agree on the scope, schedule, and budget. Any
changes after that time should go through an integrated
change control process.
Project Scope Management
Scope is defined by what is and what is not included in
the project. Product scope is the features and functions
of the project deliverables (products, services, or
results). Project scope is the work performed to deliver
the product, service, or result with the specific features
and functions.
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is like the outline
of the project. It includes all of the project deliverables,
including interim and detailed deliverables—everything
that needs to be produced. It does NOT include the
work activities needed to create those deliverables. Defin-
ing activities is considered a time management process.
The work package is the lowest level on the WBS.
Scope, time, and cost are all highly interrelated. All
have multiple planning processes and one monitoring
and controlling process.
Project Time Management
Rolling wave planning is a form of progressive elabora-
tion in which the near term is planned in great detail
440
Appendix A: PMP® and CAPM® Exam Prep Suggestions

while the latter parts of the project are planned in a
much more general fashion with intent to plan them
more carefully when the time draws nearer. Agile is a
form of rolling wave planning that is gaining popularity.
There are many sections in this book with agile notes,
but the only substantive section in the PMBOK® Guide
refers to controlling schedule on page 187.
Be able to schedule using activity on node (AON)
(also called the precedence diagramming method or
PDM). Also know how to use alternative dependencies
of SS, FF, and SF and lead and lag. Know the difference
between free float (no other activity is impacted) and
total float (the entire project is not impacted, but the
next activity in line is). Be able to compute the critical
path using the two pass method so you can answer
questions regarding float and the enumeration method
so you can more quickly answer what if questions such
as what happens if an activity now takes five days
instead of eight.
Crashing speeds up the schedule by performing cer-
tain critical path activities faster than normal, but usu-
ally costs more money. Fast tracking speeds up the
schedule by performing activities concurrently that
are normally performed in sequence. This often adds
risk to the project.
Resource optimization techniques include resource
leveling and resource smoothing. Know the difference!
Resource leveling postpones certain non-critical activi-
ties so a resource is not overloaded, but this often
requires more time to complete the project. Resource
smoothing also reduces the demand for overloaded
resources, but not beyond the point where the project
schedule would need to be lengthened.
Network diagrams, Gantt (bar) charts, and mile-
stone schedules are all approved means of showing
project schedules.
Project Cost Management
Know how to construct a time-phased, bottom-up
project budget and the difference between various
means of estimating costs and needed reserves as
shown on CPM p. 257. Know how to calculate earned
value and the definitions of all of the terms on CPM
pp. 401–405. Be prepared to see questions that ask you
to calculate estimates to complete in different ways
depending on whether the work to date is deemed to
be representative of future work or not. Know common
financial terms such as those on CPM pp. 36–37 and
247–249.
Project Quality Management
Perform quality assurance is forward looking and gives
stakeholders confidence the project team can do the
work correctly. It is proactive and includes manage-
ment systems and audits to ensure that people are
working correctly. Control quality, on the other hand,
is technically looking at deliverables and asking if they
pass specific standards. It looks backward to determine
if the outputs are good enough. Both quality assurance
and quality control are needed. In addition to what
is in the PMBOK® Guide, know the quality tools on
p. 307 and 396–400 of CPM and the quality control
terms on pp. 394–395 of CPM. The project manager
has ultimate responsibility for quality (and almost
everything else). Additionally, each person has primary
responsibility for her own work. Prevention keeps
errors out of the process while inspection keeps errors
away from the customer.
Project Human Resources
Management
All of Chapter 13 in CPM and parts of Chapter 8 apply
to Project Human Resources Management. There are
multiple lists in this knowledge area, so try to under-
stand differences between items dealing with topics
such as teams, power, conflict, and negotiation as
shown in Exhibits in CPM.
Know the differences between functional, matrix,
and projectized forms of organization. A simple sum-
mary is on p. 58 of CPM. Make sure you understand
the differences between various roles as described in
Chapter 3 of CPM. While roles can be shown on an
organizational chart or described in a document as
text, they are often also shown in a matrix. A matrix
may be called a RAM or RACI. Know stage of team
development such as on CPM p. 352. Scenario ques-

Project Communications
Management
According to PMI, project managers spend about 90%
of their time on communication in one way or another.

channels based upon the formula channels = (n2−n)/2
when n is the number of people on a team. Authoriza-
tion to perform work is always a formal communica-
tion, but it need not be written. Communication can be
more complex in a matrix organization. A war room is
a single location where the project team can keep
their stuff and use for any purpose. Exhibit 14.6 in
CPM is an easy visual to help understand performance
reporting.
Project Risk Management
The purpose of project risk management is to reduce
the risk to a level acceptable to decision makers. It is
NOT to eliminate all risks. Consider both positive risk
(opportunity) and negative risk (threat). The most risks
occur at the start of the project life cycle, but each risk
costs the most money if identified late in the life cycle
after decisions are already in place. In charters, risks
are identified, qualitative analysis is performed by ask-
ing the probability and impact of each, and response
planning is conducted for major risks. Qualitative anal-
ysis is performed on every project. If that is not
enough, quantitative analysis is also performed. All
risk management processes occur throughout the proj-
ect life cycle.
Project Procurement
Management
Procurement in the fifth edition of the PMBOK® Guide
includes only four processes of plan, conduct, control,
and close procurements. Understand contracts, both in
general and each specific type. Understand the differ-
ences between various procurement documents. The
RFI is NOT used to solicit an offer, while the others
are. Sole source is when only one vendor is available,
but single source is when a decision is made to select a
specific vendor. Close Procurements is one of only two
processes in the closing process group.
Project Stakeholder Management
A new knowledge area in the fifth edition of the PMBOK®
Guide is stakeholder management. In previous editions, it
was part of communications management. The PMBOK®
Guide process of identify stakeholders includes identify-
ing each potential stakeholder, determining what interest
each has in the project, and prioritizing the long list of
stakeholders so more attention can be paid to the most
powerful and important stakeholders. This occurs very
early as part of the initiating process group. Most projects
have multiple stakeholders with conflicting desires and
the increased focus created by establishing stakeholder
management as a distinct process group reflects this.
Ethics
Know the code of Ethics and Professional Responsi-
bility very well! There are more questions per page on
this short document than on any other topic. You may
download this document from http://www.pmi.org/~/
media/PDF/Ethics/ap_pmicodeofethics.ashx for free. It
has aspirational standards as ideal goals and mandatory
standards as bare minimums in the four areas of
responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty.
Ending Suggestions
Do not underestimate either the CAPM® or the PMP®
exam! The first time pass rate typically is between 50 and
70% and that includes many people who have taken exam
prep courses. However, I have taught many of these prep
courses, and many of my students have successfully
passed both exams using these suggestions. I am repeat-
edly told that by comparing the “what” from PMBOK®
Guide with the “how” and examples from this book (Con-
temporary Project Management), people felt very well pre-
pared. Good luck and let me know how you did!
