We know what you’re thinking. An 8K TV? Brilliant. Thanks, T3. But what about the rather sizeable elephant in the room:
that your loyal fans have recently upgraded to a 4K TV – HDR too, no doubt – and we’re only just starting to see 4K HDR

boasting four times the resolution of your now could-be-redundant 4K TV – as early as autumn 2018, might come as a
shock. But, as ever, tech continues apace and it won’t be too long before we start to see 8K content in the wild. To ensure

set to broadcast 8K signals next year. Then there’s Hollywood-specialist RED, which recently shotGuardians of the Galaxy

T3’S MISSION
OUR AWARDS
Editor’s letter
Welcome to the new-look T3 magazine! We’re thrilled 
to have you here, and it’s the result of a lot of hard work 
as we make your favourite tech mag even better. We 
wanted to create something super-modern, and yet 
keeps the best of the old T3, while adding some new 
pages that I hope you’ll love.
We’ve still got staples like State of the Art and Man vs. 
Tech, but we’ve added more pages about the gadgets we’re 
really looking forward to, from cutting-edge innovations to 
broader lifestyle gear and tips. We’ve also expanded our 
Home section with even more smart tech, including regular 
reviews and more advanced automation tips.  
Even the most casual observer will see that the 
‘connected world’ spans beyond phones and smart homes 
– everything has an app and wireless connection these 
days, even your bicycle tech. We’re embracing this with the 
new T3, and giving this great new stuff the attention and 
space it deserves.
Of course, we still love the high-tech gizmos we always

 TESLA 
ROADSTER 
2.0
 From US$200,000 ($255,615), tesla.com
Admit it: you thought electric cars were a nice, 
eco-friendly idea, but that none could ever be 
sexy enough or fast enough to replace a petrol-
slurping, high-performance car. Well, prepare to 
backtrack signiﬁcantly by saying hello to the new 
Tesla Roadster, an all-electric supercar that’s 
spoiling for a ﬁght with petrol-powered rides. 
With the Roadster, Tesla is looking to set a 
new benchmark for the world’s fastest car. It’s 
a record currently held by the Agera RS, which 
throws down at 436km/h; the Roadster’s top 
speed is said to be above 400km/h, but an exact 
ﬁgure has yet to be conﬁrmed. 
In the meantime there’s plenty else to get 
excited about here: 0-100 in 1.9 seconds – the 
ﬁrst production car to break the two-second 
mark – and a whopping 1,000-kilometre range… 
and those stats relate to the basic Roadster – 
there’ll be an option to increase the car’s brain 
and brawn (along with the price, naturally) nearer 
to the 2020 release date. 
Oh, and did we mention that one day, maybe, 
possibly, the Roadster could take to the skies? 
Yeah, Elon Musk mentioned something about 
“applying rocket tech” to make the Roadster ﬂy in 
“short hops”. But, you know, no biggie. If you do 
fancy a slice of this Tesla action, Musk’s taking 
pre-orders now via a $63,000 deposit.
The new Tesla 
Roadster gets its 
power from three 
electric motors, 
with all-wheel 
drive providing 
the control you 
need for that 
much zip

A NEED FOR SPEED
Four of you can easily cram into 
the Roadster, and you can stash its 
removable glass roof in the boot for 
some top-down action. Tesla reckons a 
full-load won’t do much to hamper the 
car’s performance of 0-100km/h in 1.9 
seconds and 0-160km/h in 4.2 seconds
ROAD RANGE
Given the Roadster’s 
astonishing 1,000-kilometre 
range you won’t be suffering 
from ‘range anxiety’. Tesla’s 
supercar has electric motors 
– that can be controlled
to maximise traction – 
powering all four wheels, 
helping it achieve that 
world-ﬁrst range record
TO THE SKIES!
Doc Brown may have got his ﬂying 
DeLorean in 2015, but Tesla and SpaceX 
CEO Elon Musk will only miss that mark 
by a few years, teasing that the new 
Roadster may one day ﬂy in “short hops”. 
His reason for building a ﬂying car? LA’s 
horrendous trafﬁc jams…

LEICA CL
 $3,700, leica-store.com.au
There’s nothing quite like a Leica to make other 
non-Leica photographers feel green with envy. 
These vintage-styled cameras ooze class and 
bear that all-important, instantly recognisable red 
logo. The new 24MP Leica CL is another retro 
head-turner. Small and light enough to go 
unnoticed when stashed in your bag, this 
compact mirrorless camera could be just the 
ticket for stylish vacation- or Instagram-ready 
photography, helping you capture Leica-quality 
images with just a few simple clicks. 
The electronic EyeRes viewﬁnder sounds 
impressive, with its ability to display a ﬁnal image 
before you press the shutter release. We’re also 
pleased to see further melding of the old and new 
with a touch- and gesture-controlled rear display 
crowned with customisable control dials.
T3 SAYS: Leica’s newcomer oozes vintage charm, 
with an EVF and gesture-controlled display.
OCULUS GO
 From US$199 ($254.30), oculus.com
If you don’t have hundreds to spend on a 
comprehensive VR kit, chances are your 
experience of affordable virtual reality runs to the 
charming Google Cardboard. Oculus wants to 
change that with the Oculus Go, an all-in-one 
wireless VR device that doesn’t need to be 
hooked up to a smartphone or expensive PC.
Oculus reckons the Go is so light and 
comfortable, thanks to breathable mesh fabric 
and facial padding, that you’ll hardly notice you’re 
wearing it. We’re keen to throw one on, especially 
to see if the new glare-reduction lenses and 
fast-switch LCD display (2560x1440 resolution) 
are as crisp and clear as we’re hoping. 
The Go also comes with a remote controller, 
but don’t expect it to fully track your motions. 
Hey, what do you expect for a small price tag?
T3 SAYS: A tantalising middle ground between 
bargain VR and the premium setups.

KEF & PORSCHE DESIGN
SPACE ONE WIRELESS
 $599, porsche-design.com
We freely admit to being suckers for premium 
over-ears, especially when they’re enrobed in  
a glorious metallic ﬁnish and sport an exclusive 
Porsche Design logo on the cushioned earcup.
These Space One Wireless headphones, ﬁtted 
with 40mm full-drivers and 20mm neodymium 
magnets, have a space-age feel. Battery life also 
seems out of this world – KEF reckons they’ll last 
for 30 hours, even with Bluetooth aptX and active 
noise cancellation (ANC) in use. A cable with mic 
is included for hi-res wired sources.
ANC tech should mean that the Space One 
Wireless eliminate external noise while ensuring 
the hi-ﬁ quality of your music will remain intact.  
We’ll take a listen and report back. Honestly, the 
things we do for you…
T3 SAYS: We’re digging these, and can’t wait to 
try our hi-res Genesis… what? We’re cool!
RING SPOTLIGHT CAM
 $329, ring.com
Strange noises outside at night are unnerving, 
especially if you live alone, but the Spotlight Cam 
aims to have your back. With Night Vision and 
motion-controlled spotlights, the stand-alone  
HD outdoor security camera can be teamed up 
with the Ring Video Doorbell.
You can also activate those spotlights via  
the Ring app and listen in on, or speak to (hey, 
two-way comms), anyone on your property.
Custom motion zones are handy for training 
the Spotlight Cam on a speciﬁc part of your 
property at a speciﬁc time. And if it spots 
something amiss? The Spotlight Cam will send 
you an app alert, so that you can watch what’s 
happening in a Live View audio and video feed, 
and sound its 110-decibel alarm.
T3 SAYS: With app-controlled spotlights and 
Night Vision Live View, the Spotlight Cam could 
offer peace of mind for solo dwellers.

RAZER PHONE
 US$699 ($894), razerzone.com
Mobile gaming is fun,  but can you honestly say 
that your handset reigns supreme at gaming on 
the go? If not, check out the Razer Phone, a 
smartphone built by for gamers. That’s not 
actually why we’re excited about it, though – 
it also just looks like a great Android 7.1 phone. 
You can work, take photos (wide angle and 
telephoto), watch videos, and all that jazz. 
It’s packed with top-end tech, including 8GB 
RAM and a Quad HD 5.7-inch LCD ‘UltraMotion’ 
display running at 120Hz, like the new iPad Pros. 
It sounds the part, too, with insanely powerful 
front-ﬁring speakers, each with a dedicated 
amp, ﬂanking the display. And with Dolby Atmos 
support built in, they actually do an amazing job 
of adding height and depth to watching movies 
or playing games without headphones.
T3 SAYS: There’s nice stuff here for gamers, but 
this is also a cutting-edge phone for a great price.
SONY AIBO
 ¥198,000 ($2,253), aibo.sony.jp/en
Aibo’s back! How much is that doggy on the 
internet? A lot. In fact, you could buy a French 
Bulldog for the Sony Aibo’s asking price. 
However, not all of us are set up to care for a real 
pupper, making the Aibo a surprisingly sweet 
alternative. Sony has ‘bred’ a few robot dogs over 
the years, but the 2017 version is by far the most 
charming litter yet.
Thanks to deep learning and AI tech, Aibo can 
detect smiles and words of praise to learn what 
makes you happy. In return Aibo enjoys lots of 
back and head scratches, and will come ﬁnd you 
for playtime. Before you bust out the dog bed, 
though, you might want to investigate getting a 
doggy passport – Aibo is currently only for sale 
in Japan, so Australian customers will have to 
import this cute robot pup. 
T3 SAYS: Aibo was genuinely iconic, and we 
hope this new version gets a worldwide release.

and squawk back. You might be 
dealing with a rogue maggie too,  
or perhaps your partner just snores. 
Whatever sounds keep you from 
uninterrupted sleep, Bose wants to

of encouragement. If you need the

might have the answer: the app-
connected Vi AI Trainer. While it 
looks like a pair of regular sports 
earphones, inside lives your own PT.
She’ll spot you during exercise – 
with the potential for her initial 
workout knowledge to expand with 
regular use – give you biofeedback 
and the encouragement you need to
push through those brutal last reps. 
Some of T3 are happiest spending
summer by going to the beach. The

T3 SAYS: With proper sleep a real

Sleepbuds could transform lives.
This AI PT will also help you create

When you listen to music in a room,
the sound reﬂects off its walls, shaping
how it reaches your ears – ﬁne details
will often be lost as sound waves
bounce, for example. But more and
more speakers are arriving that listen
for these imperfections, and then
adjust their output to compensate,
bringing the magic back to your music.
Apple’s HomePod, due for release in
early 2018, is built around adapting its
sound, listening to its own audio with
six microphones and using seven
beamforming tweeters to precisely
focus its output for your room.
Dynaudio’s new line of multi-room
speakers, the Music Collection (from
¤499/$762), features similar tech;
RoomAdapt enables the speakers to
automatically optimise performance to
complement the room and the position
they’re placed in.
Home cinema massively beneﬁts
from room adaptation too, especially
with the detail in 3D Dolby Atmos
sound. Arcam’s AVR850 AV receiver
($9,495) supports Dirac Live, a service
that uses a special mic to test your
room’s acoustics, then analyses it and
sends back a new sound proﬁle for the
AVR850 to use.
JAMMY
Practise guitar whenever and
wherever you want with this
backpack-friendly digital
six-string. The Jammy has a
sliding neck that extends out,
plus a headphone jack. An
app is also being developed
to help you learn songs.

56 years after the E-Type was ﬁrst introduced, 
Jaguar has announced that an electric version 
is in the making. The E-Type Zero is based on 
the 1968 Series 1.5 Roadster, but open up the 
bonnet and you’ll ﬁnd an electric 220kW 
motor and battery packs.
It’s a prototype for now, but if it makes 
production you’ll be able to slip behind its large 
wooden steering wheel, sink into its leather 
seats and reach 100km/h in 5.5 seconds, 
gunning it with a top speed of 242km/h and 
roughly a 270km range. A classic reborn.
ROLLS ROYCE 
GHOST BLACK BADGE
Feel the wind in your hair by driving an electric version  
of the world’s most beautiful car
Curtains twitched as a Ghost Black Badge 
moved silently down my road. It was my ﬁrst 
time behind the wheel of a Rolls Royce and 
I’d been looking forward to it. This was no 
ordinary Rolls Royce, either, with black 
chrome pantheon grill, a black Spirit of 
Ecstasy and black exhaust pipe – and 
boosted 6.6-litre, twin-turbo V12 engine.
When I opened the Ghost’s doors I was 
enveloped by soft leather and unrivalled 
craftsmanship. Inside the cabin sparkled the 
Starlight Headliner, a constellation of 1,300 
ﬁbre optic lights in the roof. I don’t care if it 
sounds gimmick or tacky – it’s breathtaking.
I was impressed by how the Ghost glided
I live in rural Oxfordshire where roads can
shake out a ﬁlling, but the Ghost turned 
them into marshmallow pathways. The 
most difﬁcult part is parking; the Ghost has 
cameras and sensors ensuring you don’t 
have an accident, but it’s still a big beast.
On my ﬁnal night with it, I climbed into 
the backseat, ﬁred up the massagers, and 
gazed up at the ﬁbre optic stars. It’s not an 
alienating machine, it’s like home. I became 
incredibly attached to the Ghost Black 
Badge. It’s unlike anything I’ve driven  
before, and incredibly endearing.
It’s fast, reﬁned and menacing, but can Rolls really roll out enough 
luxury to match its six-ﬁgure price? T3’s Spencer Hart ﬁnds out

THE SMART WAY TO STAY
From a robot concierge to iPhones for room keys, travel journalist 
Simon Horsford checks into the world’s best high-tech hotels
In the past, your hotel room key might be 
attached to something akin to a doorstop 
and the TV limited to a few channels only. 
Nowadays hotels are wising up to the 
demand for the latest technology and  
our desire to control room features via  
apps and smartphones.
Hub by Premier Inn (hubhotels.co.uk)  
is the tech-savvy spin-off from the big 
chain, with a ﬂagship hotel in King’s Cross 
(there are six others in London and two in 
Edinburgh). Download the hotel’s app and 
you can control almost everything in your 
room with it, from the smart TV and lighting 
to an interactive map on the wall. The room 
key also shows housekeeping whether the 
room is occupied or not, which might spare 
you a few blushes.
Or how about the automated check-in 
and a robot concierge that delivers your 
bags to your cabin (room) at Yotel in New 
York (yotel.com)? In each cabin you’ll also 
ﬁnd a smart wall and a smart bed, as well as 
a “techno wall” with TV, a work station and 
monsoon shower.
Avant-garde design isn’t the only 
attraction of Blow Up Hall 5050 
(blowuphall5050.com) in Poland, either, 
where you get an iPhone for a room key –  
it uses digital recognition tech to direct  
you to your room and unlock the door.  
Talk about a smarter way to recharge.

The Foreo Luna 2 for Men ($249, foreo.com) is a palm-
sized facial brush designed to cleanse, tone and prep 
skin for shaving. It has textured dual sides: one for 
cleansing, one for anti-ageing. The brush is small but not 
slippery when wet, thanks to an easy-grip antibacterial 
silicone covering. Foreo claims the brush has 450 uses 
per charge, and while we haven’t been using it that 
long, ours is still going strong after a month’s use.
There are 12 levels of intensity, depending on 
individual skin needs. We used the brush morning and 
night, applying a cleanser to our face then moving the 
brush in small circles over our skin for one minute as 
instructed. It was clear from the ﬁrst use that Foreo’s 
T-Sonic tech (8,000 pulsations per minute) removed 
more dirt, oil and dead skin than a cleanser alone, 
leaving skin smoother and more vibrant. That cleansing 
action also had a ‘lifting’ effect on facial hairs, leading to 
less razor burn than usual. 
The brush’s anti-ageing mode uses lower-frequency 
pulsations to tone ﬁne lines, and can be massaged over 
skin after moisturising to boost its effectiveness. 
Although our ﬁne lines are still present, we noticed after 
a few uses that our skin felt better toned. Ultimately, the 
Foreo Luna 2 for Men is a nifty facial brush for perking 
up dull, slack skin, pre- and post-shave, especially during 
the drier winter months.
THE FINAL WORD Foreo’s facial brush delivers a deeper 
cleanse and preps skin for rash-free shaving.

We make some of our most
unwise decisions at a desk.
Guru just caught himself
leaning sideways with his wrists all 
wonky, and now his hands are
throbbing. The ergonomics of your
workstation could be as much to
blame as your keyboard; make sure
you’re kitted out with a good desk
and a proper ofﬁce chair – try the
$819 Herman Miller Sayl if you’re 
feeling really ﬂush, or IKEA’s
Markus ($349) otherwise.
Defeating the menace of RSI
and its sinister cousin Carpal
Tunnel Syndrome takes more than 
just sitting right. There’s no
standard hand, so if your mitts 
don’t suit, for example, the shallow 
leaf springs of the Apple Magic
Keyboard ($179), you may be
suited to a full-travel keyswitch.
Extreme tendon restitution can
be found in the wacky world of
ergonomic keyboards. There’s the
split variety, like the travel-friendly
GoldTouch Go! 2 (around $200) or
Microsoft’s Sculpt line (from $90),
which angle the individual halves of 
the keyboard outwards so that
your ﬁngers rest on the keys
without distorting your wrists.
There’s also the scooped-out-and-
split variety as produced by
Maltron, though you’ll be paying up 
to $500.
On the silliest extreme, we have
the vertical split, where each half of
the keyboard is upright and you
hold your hands in karate-chop
fashion to type; you’ll likely have to
refer to rear-view mirrors to see
what you’re typing. Or there’s the
Orbitouch ($500), which doesn’t
have any keys, just handles that
you waggle to chord in keystrokes.

KEYBOARD IS UPRIGHT AND

Drool is pooling in the corner of Guru’s 
mouth for the HOPii Micro Brewery, a 
high-tech fermentation device which 
promises to brew up the ﬁnest craft beers 
right on your kitchen counter. It’s a bit steep 
at US$600 retail (about $760) and GaGu 
has had to internalise his rage at both the 
HOPii’s awkwardly capitalised name and its 
insistence on using special ingredient pods 
to tie you into its ecosystem, but still. Craft 
beer at home. (See p58 for an alternative.)
Some aeons back, GaGu was asked about 
whether the Nintendo Switch was any good, 
and responded that his true assessment 
would probably depend on the eventual 
release of Super Mario Odyssey. Well the 
mustachioed one has 
arrived, and the results 
are in: the Switch is 
nigh-essential. Savvy 
developers are pulling 
some real power out 
of it: rereleases  
like Doom, LA Noire 
and Skyrim are 
tremendously
realised, and 
more original 
titles will hit 
soon. If you’re 
a gamer and don’t have a Switch, buy a 
Switch. You will love it.
Sleep is important to Guru, what little of it 
he gets – more hours of the day are reserved 
for tinkering with gadget combinations and 
smart home ideas than is realistically 
healthy. With this in mind, it’s about time for 
the ratty old sweat-soaked master bedroom 
mattress to be replaced with something 
new. But what? There are tons of bed-in-a-
box companies popping up, but choosing 
one of these is nigh-impossible without a 
showroom to go lolloping around. Most 
offer a trial period, but who’s going to be 
hooﬁng a mattress out of the house after 
100 days just to get it sent back? So Guru 
asks you: have you tried a mail-order 
memory foam mattress? How was it for 
you? Drop us an email with your detailed 
bedtime experiences.

There’s a bit more to this
question – our reader is 
looking for something 
which can push Dolby Digital audio 
from both HDMI and OTA sources 
through an optical connection, just 
like his current Panasonic screen 
doesn’t. The good news is that if a 
TV will pump out straight 5.1 it 
generally follows that it will also 
downconvert TrueHD and the like 
to a format your PLAYBAR can 
understand. Sadly, certain smart 
TVs have Android systems that 
can’t actually manage the task. 
Some even hide the functionality 
behind engineer-only service 
menus because they hate you.
Guru doesn’t know, or even care 
to ask, what kind of TV you’re 
looking for. He presumes, though, 
that your unwillingness to toss out 
that PLAYBAR means you’re on a 
bit of a budget. If you can’t put 
down $3,999 for the amazing Sony 
X93E, try one of LG’s UH61 range, 
which can be had for around 
$1,000 and support all kinds of 
optical audio trickery.
A
Unlucky, bub: your phone is 
probably reporting back to 
someone about something 
you’re doing. That’s just a thing that 
happens, although it’s probably not 
a process that should concern you 
too much – this is anonymised, 
limited and merely helps 
manufacturers build better phones. 
But some handsets are doing a 
little more. Guru has supported 
OnePlus in times past, but recent 
revelations about the level of 
logging and reporting in its Oxygen 
OS are a little worrying. Cheap 
Chinese Android phones are often 
much more insidious, keeping their 
masters fed with more information 
than even GaGu’s network of little 
birds knows about you. That’s a lot. 
If you’re sticking with your 
current hardware, pawing through 
your phone’s settings screens 
should give you a number of 
options to disable any voluntary 
reportage. There are further secret 
options, if you’re using Android, 
within the mysterious developer 
options screen – ﬁnd these, usually, 
by tapping your phone’s version 
number seven or so times. Don’t 
go tweaking anything you don’t 
understand, mind. Guru isn’t paid 
to be your tech support monkey.
iPhones have options to turn off 
data sharing, but Apple’s privacy 
protection is pretty strong anyway.
If you’re happy to change, you 
can start by buying a phone from a 
reputable brand and hoping that 
there’s not some kind of secret 
information gathering going on. 
The bigger the company behind it, 
the more they’ll have to do to patch 
holes in their software to stop 
anything untoward sifting through 
your data. If you’re so terriﬁed that 
someone’s listening in, it turns out 
Blackberry’s phones are still 
relevant. Models like the Priv (from 
around $300) run stock Android 
with no hidden extras, sandbox 
user accounts to protect them, and 
operate VPNs to shield your data.

‘ve been sitting in
a well-decorated
for an hour. It feel
bit longer than th
least because my boyfriend
giving menuclear death sta
the seat to my right.
A decent proportion of t
audience has walked out, a
left are merrily chattering a
themselves or engaging in
compulsive phone proddin
though we’re in a cinema so, of
course, there’s no signal.
The reason is that a well-known
Korean tech brand – let’s call them
‘Samsung’ – has decided to hold
what is either the bravest or most
ill-conceived launch event ever.
Christmas day, every day
People often ask me, “What’s it like
doing your job? I bet your house is
all full of gadgets.” And, to be fair,
yes, my house is all full of gadgets.
 More succinctly, a colleague
recently asked, “It’s like Christmas
every day for you guys, is it?”
This seemed to hit the nail on the
head, because it is like Christmas
every day. By which I mean it’s quite
repetitive, and generally slightly
disappointing. Yes, some of what
comes in is like getting a LEGO
Millennium Falcon, but a lot of it is
like socks, and not even good ones.
Going to tech launch events can
also feel a bit like having Christmas
every day: same food, same people,
way too much booze, and a
reassuring yet tiring atmosphere
of opulent same-iness.
So at least Samsung tried
something new. As you know, it
does a range of stylish washing
machines that let you add missing
socks mid-wash, and employ a
range of technologies with exciting
names like ‘EcoBubble’,
adve
that Samsung was just spending a
bit of excess cash on an unusually
themed party and a short ﬁlm to
rival John Lewis’ Christmas ads.
One slightly odd detail I was
aware of was that the music for this
ad was by contemporary classical
composer Michael Nyman, best
known for the soundtrack to The
Piano, in which Harvey Keitel crawls
around in the nude, grunting.
the mood got worse.
I swear this is no exaggeration: 
the ﬁlm was 66 minutes of a 
close-up of a washing machine. 
Okay, to be fair, it would 
transition, agonisingly slowly, to a 
slightly tighter or wider close-up of 
the same washing machine. Less 
frequently, during the longest 66 
minutes of all time, it would cut to 
a wide shot of Michael Nyman, 
playing his composition on the 
piano, right next to the washing 
machine, while looking like an 
angry owl. I could sympathise with 
his enraged plight. 
However, we did stay to the 
end, and Nyman’s unadorned, 
percussive piano music was 
undeniably good. The visuals, by 
deﬁnition, were pretty tedious. 
What Samsung had done here, in 
effect, was commission Michael 
Nyman to write a piece of music, 
like an Austrian archduke getting 
Mozart to knock up a chamber 
piece for their birthday party.
The result was purest avant 
garde cinema, of a type very few 
people would pay to see. It was 
boring to watch, but also the most 
out-there, arty, daring tech launch 
I’ve ever been to. I’m not sure my 
other half’s ever going to forgive 
me for dragging him along, mind…
This is no exaggeration: 
the ﬁlm was 66 minutes

Mirrorless cameras
side from the seductive design
based on trophy ﬁlm cameras of
old, it’s easy to see the appeal of
mirrorless digital cameras. As
their classiﬁcation suggests, the mirror
mechanisms of traditional, bulkier SLR
cameras have been removed to enable smaller
camera bodies, which has the knock-on
eﬀect of more compact lenses. The result is
a lighter overall weight and less back and
shoulder ache when carting one around all
day. At the same time, crucially, and in the 
A
majority of cases, the sensor at the heart of
each camera has stayed the same size as
that found in a larger digital SLR. That has
maintained quality very near to – or in some
cases on a par with – a larger, outwardly more
‘professional’ camera. This has meant not
only enthusiastic amateurs but also a wave of
professional photographers ‘going mirrorless’.
As a result, and unlike the DSLR or cheaper
point-and-shoot compact market, mirrorless
cameras, alongside premium cameras, are 
still very much booming.
It’s worth noting when eyeing up any
mirrorless camera that you’ll be buying into
that particular manufacturer’s system, by
which we mean the various attendant lenses,
ﬂashes and accessories you’ll need with the
body. So, if you’re considering expanding
your equipment in the future, take a look at
the additional bits of kit each provides – and 
how many. In other words, a purchase
decision shouldn’t be based 100 per cent on
how funky a speciﬁc camera looks, but also 
the support that comes with it.

anon’s modernist M100 is the 
option here that looks and feels 
the most outwardly plastic-y,  
but then it’s also the least 
expensive and, given the fact that it boasts a 
physically large APS-C-sized sensor – the 
bigger the sensor, theoretically the better the 
photos – it is stupendously small. With 
minimal top- and back-plate buttons and 
controls, this is a camera that anyone could 
pick up and start snapping with. Those who 
prefer more physical, tactile controls for 
tweaking manual settings may be 
disappointed, however, and the lack of an 
eye-level viewﬁnder may be further 
deﬂating; stills and videos are instead 
composed via its backplate LCD. The built-in 
ﬂash, sunk unobtrusively into the top plate, 
but which springs forth dramatically when 
activated, is also a neat trick.
Overtly old-school with its rangeﬁnder-
camera-like ridged dials on the top plate to 
govern shutter speed and exposure, and 
vacant hotshoe for attaching various 
accessories, Fuji’s X-E2 should appeal to  
Overtly old-school,  
the Fuji X-E2 should 
appeal to the nostalgic
For handling and design, we loved the tactile buttons on
the Olympus and the ﬂexibility of tilting touchscreen 
plus eye-level viewﬁnder with built-in sensor
the nostalgic. If it weren’t for the LCD screen 
on the backplate, we might imagine this 
camera was from the 1970s. We do however 
get a built-in electronic viewﬁnder with eye 
sensor, that switches the eye-level window 
on and the larger LCD below it oﬀ.
For those who like their cameras crammed 
with tactile controls but still small enough to 
slip into a coat pocket, the brand’s E-M10 MK 
III will satisfy with its mix of classical styling 
and contemporary practicality. It has it all in 
terms of handling; eye-level viewﬁnder plus 
larger tilting LCD, along with vacant hotshoe 
for adding an accessory ﬂash, plus there’s a 
built-in bulb hidden just above the lens.  
In practical terms, the smaller Four Thirds 
sensor employed by the Olympus, as opposed 
to the larger APS-C sensors in the Canon and 
Fuji, enables a longer focal reach from a 
physically smaller lens.

megapixel resolutions offered by the 
Canon and Fuji cameras on test here would 
seem to out-gun the Olympus’ relatively 
humble 16.1 megapixels. But, of course, 
that’s only if we’re playing the numbers 
game. Pixels aren’t everything, because the 
ability of the lens in use to resolve all that 
information, and the physical dimensions of 
the sensor onto which light is directed, also 
play their part. The Canon and Fuji offer 
larger APS-C-sized sensors, as typically 
found in DSLRs, while the Olympus uses 
the smaller Four Thirds type. But if using  
a smaller chip, cramming less pixels onto it 
makes sense, because overcrowding can 
lead to visible image grain or ‘noise’ the 
darker the shooting conditions get.

mall camera, big sensor is the
chief appeal of the Canon EOS
M100, which in practical terms
ensures it’s a camera compact
enough to slip comfortably into a jacket,
while being able to achieve DSLR-like image
quality. While there are a handful of EF-M-
mount lenses that can be attached to this
camera directly, buying an optional adapter 
provides access to 70+ additional lenses,
which is a huge advantage. Simplicity and
price ensure this is attractive for anyone
stepping up from a smartphone, who will love 
the touchscreen plus Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
options for sharing images. We were using
this one with a 15-45mm kit lens, a good 
all-encompassing starter option.
Also with a big sensor, yet a slightly
bigger and heavier frame, the Fuji X-E3 is,
surprisingly, the ﬁrst in its series to feature
Bluetooth. Like the others here, focus and
exposure can be controlled with a ﬁnger tap 
on the LCD, even if the screen itself isn’t
angle-adjustable. We also get ﬁnger-pinch-
and-ﬂick zoom capabilities, reminiscent of a
smartphone screen, plus a newly developed
image recognition algorithm. Aluminium

nitty gritty, help this one stand out from the 
crowd. We were using the Fuji with an
18-55mm standard zoom, allowing for a
broad range of subject matter to be captured.
While the Olympus can’t compete with
the other two here for sensor size or headline
resolution, it is feature-packed, including
adjustable LCD, ﬂash, touch-panel screen and
eye-level viewﬁnder. We also get ﬁve-axis
image stabilisation deployed when shooting
stills and video, with the latest must-have of
4K capture being oﬀered. New features of the
Mark III include a Bleach Bypass digital eﬀects
ﬁlter, while the shooting mode menu includes 
an Advanced Photo Mode, providing the
ability to ﬁne-tune imagery in-camera,
as well as access fun settings such as Live

The Fuji required more familiarisation to get the best results, suggesting 
those who linger over their shots will get the most out of it
he diminutive Canon is more
ﬁddly than conventionally styled,
larger rivals; we had to raise its
screen to get a ﬁngernail under
the catch for media card access, which the
screen bezel otherwise obscures. The lack of
a proper handgrip was also more noticeable.
However, it was quick to power up, ﬁnd focus
and capture a shot, and presenting its three
core shooting modes on a dial next to the
shutter-release button keeps things simple.
Image quality is good, if not quite knockout,
with warm colours straight out of the camera, 
and particularly lush autumnal greens,
browns and blues. We were able to achieve
some pleasing shallow-depth-of-ﬁeld eﬀects 
with the kit lens.
The Olympus E-M10 Mark III is the most
comfortable and natural in use – its large,
prominent top-plate buttons and dials,
exposed like a clock’s inner mechanisms, aid
adjustments on the ﬂy. The fact that they’re
crammed together may make for a daunting
layout for the uninitiated, but the OM-D is
swift and responsive, and its rear LCD is
impressively sharp. Also detailed are its
pictures, even with a bog-standard 14-42mm 
The E-M10 Mark III feels
the most comfortable and 
natural in the palm
zoom lens. Colours fall on the side of
naturalistic when compared with the Canon,
but can be vividly enriched in-camera via art 
eﬀects ﬁlters if so desired.
Our second choice for performance and
convenience after the Olympus would be the 
Fuji X-E3. Again, we loved its tweakable
top-plate dials for shutter and exposure, but
more direct access to shooting modes would
have been preferable. As it is, we get a small
‘drive’ button that doubles up as the delete
button on the backplate for this purpose,
with stills capture at the top of a left-of-
screen menu, and video capture relegated to
bottom. Again, you get bags of detail out of
the X-E3’s images, plus a real lushness to
forest greens and browns in our test shots.
The Fuji is actually our top choice for imagery,
but the extra responsiveness of the Olympus 
means it edges to the top in this test.

Three big names in smart assistants, but only two on test...
AMAZON 
Amazon’s aggressive licensing of Alexa 
means it’s made its way into a number of 
new devices recently, though not all of them 
offer the same full control or range of skills 
that Amazon’s own Echo range has. Bear that 
in mind when buying.
GOOGLE 
At press time, Google’s own devices are 
the only way to use the advanced smarts 
of Google Assistant at home, but there are 
more coming – the company opened the 
Assistant up to other companies in mid-
2017, so we’ll see more in 2018.
SIRI
Apple’s been taking its time bringing a Siri-based 
smart home speaker to market; Homepod was 
originally slated for a summer 2017 release, 
but has been delayed until early 2018 for more

The upper end of Amazon’s audio Echo line sticks
more closely to the original Echo design, at least
outwardly. Again, it’s import only at this stage. Available
in looming black, industrial silver or appliance white,
this hefty cylinder retains the size and dotted speaker
grille of its forebear. Volume is controlled by asking
$OH[D QLFHO\ WR VHW LW WR D VSHFLĆF OHYHO RU E\ WZHDNLQJ
the rotating volume collar on the top. Like its more squat
sibling, there’s a new Dolby-powered speaker package
installed, and this unit’s size gives rise to a somewhat
larger and more resonant sound. The Echo Plus is much
more than a smart speaker, though. Amazon has brought 
in Zigbee support, meaning the Echo Plus operates
as a proper home hub, controlling your smart devices
directly rather than interfacing with their own hubs. This
should (if your devices are compatible, as tons are) vastly
simplify and speed up any home setup, and the Alexa app
DXWRPDWLFDOO\ VQLIIV DURXQG \RXU KRPH WR ĆQG UHOHYDQW
kit, making it easy to set up. At least in theory: its home
hub portion feels somewhat buggy at this stage, although 
we’d gamble on it improving as the Echo Plus ages.
THE FINAL WORD
An Echo but so much more – once the home hub teething 
troubles are sorted, this will be unbeatable.

While many features stay the same between them, your
choice of a smart ecosystem can make a big difference to
your day to day. Case in point, Google Assistant – available
on the Home and Home Mini, as well as some other speakers 
coming soon – is the only way to control a Chromecast
vocally, and it’s much more adept at using natural language
than its competitor. While it had more trouble with our
accent than Alexa did (and, on the Home, struggled more to
hear its wake word) there’s also proper multi-user support
built in, with voice recognition for everyone in your family 
and their personal Google accounts.
The unit itself is small and apes the styling of many of
*RRJOHèV KRPH GHYLFHV ZLWK D ćDW VODQWHG WRS D KLGGHQ ULQJ
of RGB LEDs in said slice, and a cloth grille for its speaker. 
Not the sort of thing that’s hard to tuck away, but not
overly obtrusive either. It throws out a bouncy sound when
streaming via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, although the Home isn’t
strong enough to replace your proper stereo by any means, 
particularly as it lacks any form of physical output.

Aww, isn’t it cute? Google’s teensy little Home, pitched
in both size and price to compete directly with Amazon’s
Echo Dot, one-ups its puck-shaped competition in the
style stakes, and it’s got audio built in too. It’s like a
technologically adept cloth pebble, with a string of four
hidden RGB lights in the top, hidden touch buttons on the
edges of the cloth, and a physical switch for deactivating 
the microphone array.
For its size, the Home Mini belts out some perfectly
reasonable and somewhat surprising tones with muscle,
and voice recognition is good. Like the larger Google Home, 
though, this is no replacement for a more competent
speaker system, and there’s no audio output, either 3.5mm
or Bluetooth, so if you’re looking to connect a stereo to
your network you’ll also need to invest in a Chromecast

Let’s get your Nest Protect set up, and show you  
how to access its most important options
SAFE & SOUND
POWER 
PLUGS
If your Protect 
detects  
a carbon 
monoxide 
build-up, it can 
tell your Belkin WeMo switches to 
turn your appliances off, in case 
they’re the cause. That’s especially 
handy if your WeMo is connected 
to an electirc heater, but it could 
also be useful to turn off your 
stereo to alert you to a problem.
SMART 
LIGHTING 
When the Protect 
detects a smoke 
emergency, your 
Philips Hue or 
LIFX lights will 
ćDVKUHGWR 
help warn you, 
then stay red, 
which helps cut through the smoke.  
They’ll do this even when turned 
off in the middle of the night, so 
you easily see your escape route.
INTERNET 
CAMERAS 
If you have a Nest 
Cam as well as  
a Protect, your 
camera will kick 
into life when 
smoke is detected, 
sending you a

SET IT UP IN THE APP
Get the Nest app on your

have it, and log into your Nest
account (or create one if you 
need to). Tap the ‘Add New’ 
button to add a Nest device, 
then follow the instructions 
on-screen, which will guide you
through adding the product 
using the QR code on the back,
and adding it to your Wi-Fi.

CHOOSE A LOCATION
As part of the set-up process,
you’ll need to specify the 
Protect’s location – this is 
what it will call itself if it needs
to alert you to something, so 
pick one that makes sense for
where you’ve installed it.

When you have at least one 
product installed, the Nest 
shows a Home screen when 
you open it. This lists any 
products you own, grouped by 
location, with easy access to 
any handy controls for them 
– a Protect is represented by

screen, tap the icon
representing your Protect.
A new screen will appear, with
an immediate pop-up showing
the health of your Protect,
including the last times it
tested itself. Dismiss this and
tap the ‘Check-up’ option at

Smart mood lamps
PHILIPS HUE GO
$149.95, meethue.com/en au
Unlike the others, Philips’ offering isn’t so much a lamp, but
more of an uplight. This directional lighting is great for mood-
boosting room corners, but with a huge 300 lumen output,
you’ll have to lower the brightness if you want it facing forward.
Happily, this is easy to do – just unplug the power and it’ll dim to
40 per cent brightness. Alternatively, there are pre-set scenes

and hold to cycle through its myriad colour options – release
to choose one. Sadly, unless you pair the Hue Go with a
compatible Philips Hue Bridge, you won’t be able to control this
light through an app, so colour choice is more limited. If you do,
you’ll be rewarded with remote control, scheduling, and more.
Hue Go isn’t waterproof and battery life is a mere three hours.
MIPOW PLAYBULB SPHERE
$62.79, mipow.com
Despite being the cheapest mood lamp here, MIPOW’s
offering is outstanding. Not only do you get a great-looking,
well-built light constructed from glass, it also comes with
a wireless charging pad (which has grippy rubber underneath)
so you can easily recharge it when it runs dry. And that won’t
happen too soon, what with its eight-hour battery life. It’s also
IP65 waterproof, meaning you can use it in the rain, and a small
carry handle on the underside allows you to carry it around
with ease. At 230 lumens, it’s also plenty bright. So far, so great.
On the app side of things, there’s a cavalcade of options,
LQFOXGLQJ ĆYH GLIIHUHQW OLJKWLQJ HIIHFWV D 7DS7DS IXQFWLRQ
which enables you to double-tap the top of the light to change
colours, and you can shake your phone to switch colours.
You can even group multiple lights to control them all at once.
Super bright and a great mood enhancer, though
the need for a Hue Bridge to access its smarts will 
no doubt put oﬀsome people.
 
The Playbulb Sphere does everything remarkably
well, making it the lamp of choice for any situation, 
indoors or out.

GET MORE LIGHT
If you’ve got a big space to light up, you’ll
want to lay your hands on more lamps to
increase the ambience. The more you
have, the greater the light output, and
– bonus feature – you can individually
adjust the lighting to suit each area.
JOIN THEM UP
Now that you’ve created a ﬂotilla of lights
throughout your home, is there anything
else you can do? Well, yes. All the lights
featured here can be connected to
another (of the same type), enabling
you to control them all at once.
SAVE SOME JUICE
If you leave your light on all day, the
battery will drain quicker than T3’s bank
account on payday. Most of the lights
here can be put to sleep with a simple
button press. The Hue Go can even be 
scheduled using a Hue Bridge.

THE 
DESIGN 
AWARD
hen the PS4 Pro launched
in November, 2016, it
marked a new kind of
console – an update to the
previous generation, more like a PC
upgrade than the old console leaps.
Now it’s Microsoft’s turn, and it’s
gone all-out. Loaded with 50 per cent
more graphics power than the PS4
Pro, as well as 4K output, HDR, Dolby
Atmos and a full-blown Ultra HD
Blu-ray player, the Xbox One X is not
only the most powerful video game
console ever made, but also an
incredibly well-specced multi-media
entertainment hub, which outstrips
the PS4 Pro in versatility.
However, as with Sony’s system,
Microsoft doesn’t have a particularly
wide selection of games on oﬀer at
launch that really tap into the Xbox
One X’s power. There are select titles
that properly make use of it, such as
Forza Motorsport 7, but right now
the X is very much a specialist in
enhancing existing games with extra
bells and whistles. Those glorious
enhancements are most welcome –
we love this new wave of iterative
enhancements to systems and games
– but there’s a divorce between
hardware quality and experience we
need to acknowledge.
Unboxing the Xbox One X reveals
a system that, weirdly, is reminiscent
in terms of shape and design of Sony’s
classic PlayStation 2, with a notable
overhang looming over its disc slot,
eject and sync buttons, alongside a
front-facing USB port. The console
carries over the tasteful dimpling
pattern we saw ﬁrst introduced on
the Xbox One S on its side panels and
is actually amazingly small. In terms
of density, the Xbox One X feels
incredibly solid and exudes quality.
It’s the most powerful console ever made, 
with amazing tech across the board, but is it 
potent enough to make you open your wallet?

Xbox One X

Inside, the Xbox One X is as
impressive as its outside. Its graphics
power is roughly equivalent to a
mid- to high-end PC gaming GPU,
which on the market today costs
almost as much as the console itself.
Having this much power means that
the Xbox One X is much more capable
of producing the over-eight million
pixels that are required for native 4K,
while the PS4 Pro often has to make
do with, admittedly clever and
convincing, upscaling trickery.
The biggest advantage of this 4K
resolution is pure detail. With four
times the number of pixels, even the
smallest things are clearly visible, and 
the most distant objects are clear. A 
great example of this is in Assassin’s 
Creed Origins, with the X not only 
allowing the game to be rendered in 
4K, but also oﬀer twice the detailed 
draw distance in the environment 
when compared to it running on an 
Xbox One S, so you can see more of 
what’s around you, giving a better 
sense of place, and helping navigation.
Another good example of the 
power of the X came while playing the 
programmed-for-native-4K Forza 
Motorsport 7, which was absolutely 
spectacular, with everything from the 
vehicles and their interiors, to the 
tire-marked race tracks, and onto the 
lush surrounding environments all 
incredibly crisp and fantastically 
detailed. Realistic, dare we say?
4K in the road
Forza’s racing also showed oﬀ the 
beneﬁts of 4K in seeing objects in the 
far distance, which remained clear 
and readable, when at a lower 
resolution they would have become 
too fuzzy to really clock. Indeed, 
when we booted up Forza on the Xbox 
One S, while the ﬂuidity of framerate 
and overall experience remained the

ESSENTIAL ADD-ONS

bulbous ugliness of 
the original Xbox

same, draw distance, texture details 
and weather eﬀects all simply weren’t 
at the level of the X, with some 
marked downgrades.
HDR support is huge for games too, 
really elevating scenes like exploring 
dark caves in Rise of the Tomb Raider 
as the darkness is cut through by 
Lara’s glow stick. It’s atmospheric, 
and just extremely cool.
Dolby good to me
We also love that the Xbox One X 
oﬀers support for Dolby Atmos, 
which enables sound to come from 
above you, as well as in front and 
behind, to create an incredibly 
immersive surround experience – we 
loved it in Assassin’s Creed Origins, 
where we could hear a guard’s 
footsteps on the roof above us. It 
also oﬀers a better surround-sound 
experience in general, because 
individual eﬀects are each mapped 
accurately in 3D, so move around 
you more realistically – great for 
awareness in online shooters. It can 
all work with headphones, too.
Atmos is also a boon for movies, 
pairing perfectly with the 4K Blu-ray 
drive. The quality here is great – the 
crispness of imagery and wide range 
of contrast were excellent. 
The Xbox One X is a powerful piece
of kit, and it’s capable of producing 
images that are truly stunning to 
behold but, trust us when we say this,
you’ll deﬁnitely need a premium 
set-up to be able to fully beneﬁt. 
We noted a year ago that the PS4 
Pro was overkill for anyone who 
doesn’t have a 4K TV, and the Xbox 
One X even more so. You’ll want a set 
that supports both 4K and HDR, and 
though these are getting much more 
aﬀordable (see p86, for example), not 
everyone has these yet. Meanwhile, 
on the audio side you’re going to need 
a swish Dolby-equipped soundbar or 
home cinema ampliﬁer/speaker 
combo to get the beneﬁts of vertical, 
object-based audio. Again, options 
are growing (we tested with a Focal 
Sib Evo 5.1 system that has Atmos 
height speakers built in – review next 
issue), but only the early adopters 
will actually get any beneﬁt from it 
right now. 
But that’s kind of the point of the 
Xbox One X: it’s a console that’s 
designed to make full use of the most 
high-tech home theatre set-ups, to 
really push them to their limits and 
make use of all of their bells and 
whistles to produce a gaming and 
viewing experience like no other.  
If that’s you, this is a truly brilliant
addition to your set-up.
If it’s not, or even if you already
own an Xbox One S, then you do
really need to take a long hard look
at the list of Xbox One X-enhanced
games before pulling the trigger.
Maybe it’s not a buy for right now,
but instead for when your favourite
franchise gets a big enhancement
on it, or when you’ve kitted out that
dream home entertainment set-up.
We’re impressed PC-level power means
games look amazing; great design and small
size; improved interface.

say, it’s a more laborious process.
He calculates the volume of
ingredients we’ll need for our
homebrew IPA recipe, as well as the
predicted alcohol content, IBU and
gravity. To make the mash, we need
to heat the water to 66 degrees.
However, we’ll need to hit 74 degrees
to compensate for the cold grain we’ll
be adding – and maintaining the mash 
temperature is a notoriously tricky
task. Enter ETI’s SuperFast Thermapen
4 digital thermometer. It gets to work
quickly, giving a reading in just three
seconds, and the handy 360-degree
self-rotating display makes it easy to 
record the data from any angle. 
An hour and a half later, the mash
is done. Andy sparges the grains,
commences the boil, and adds the
different hops at various stages over
the next hour and 15 minutes. (It’s
worth noting that he’s been sterilising
the kit at every stage after the boil -
unlike with the Pico, which is a self-
sterilising machine.)
When Andy’s done, he runs cold
water through a 7.6m Copperhead
Immersion Wort Chiller to cool the
wort to pitching temperature. We’re
in the danger zone, here: this is where 
the wort is most susceptible to
bacterial contamination, so we need to
bring the temperature down to 20°C
as quickly as possible. Fortunately,
the Copperhead handles it like a pro,
reducing the temperature in a fraction 
of the time an ice bath would take 
(and with a lot less mess). 
et’s face it. Brewing a
perfectly crafted beer
from your own home isn’t
as easy as it looks. Nailing
the mash. Calculating volumes.
Getting your head around grains,
hops, yeasts and how they work
together. It’s an intimidating science
– and that’s before you even get into 
the business of water proﬁling or 
fermentation temperatures.
But when you get it right, pouring a
glass of delicious homebrew from a
keg in your kitchen is unbeatable. So
when a machine that promised to craft
perfect beer without the complex
equipment, techniques and clean-up
came across our desk we were quite
curious. Could a countertop gadget
really create a tastier brew at just the 
push of a button?
ART OVER SCIENCE
To ﬁnd out, we create two batches of
IPA over a weekend: the ﬁrst using
US ﬁrm PicoBrew’s $799 precision
brewing appliance Pico Pro; the
second using time-honoured 
homebrewing methods.
With the Pico Pro, it’s certainly
easier. The machine automates the key
stages of the brewing process, letting 
you craft ﬁve litres of beer in your
kitchen in about two hours, using
ready-to-brew $20 PicoPaks – pre-
measured sachets of grains, hops and
yeasts from more than 160 breweries
around the world. Want to make your 
own? You can – well, sort of – by
adding custom ingredients to a
selection of base recipes through
PicoBrew’s Freestyle program.
(There’s only one choice of yeast 
though, and limited hops.)
Initial set-up of the Pico Pro is a ﬁve-
minute affair, involving little more than
removing the packaging, plugging it
into a socket, connecting to Wi-Fi and
registering online. Despite being
labelled a ‘countertop’ machine, it
doesn’t actually ﬁt under the cabinets 
on our kitchen counter, but a swift
location change – and a 10-minute
pre-rinse later – and we’re ready to go.
The good news is that it’s easy to
operate. I place the PicoPak into the
machine – each one has a RFID chip on
top, enabling the Pico Pro to identify it 
– and add water. We’re making an
Imperial IPA, Stingray, from San
Diego-based microbrewery Coronado
Brewing Company, so I use the control
knob to set the alcohol content to 7.9
per cent (crikey) and bitterness to 48
IBU (international bettering unit), and
hit start. That’s it. The machine heats 
the water, runs it through the pack and
whips up a batch of wort in just a few
hours, letting us watch its progress 
using the online tracker. 
PRECISION INSTRUMENT
This is truly liberating. We’ve been
homebrewing for a few years now, and
the biggest challenge is maintaining
control over the temperature. Get it
wrong and you’re sunk. You won’t get
the predicted conversion of sugars
from the grain, which will affect the 
alcohol content, and the taste.
With the Pico Pro, it’s reassuring to
know the optimum temperature is
being maintained throughout. And 
though it doesn’t tell you which hops
are going in at which stage, it does
walk you through each step of the
brew process with a clarity that would
be useful to beginners. The best part?
It slashes the physical brewing process
from four hours to two, and you don’t
have to baby-sit the beer – turn the 
Pico Pro on and forget about it.
We don’t forget about it, though.
Because it’s loud. Very loud. This isn’t
a machine that’ll let you quietly brew
without the rest of the household
knowing about it. But it can be left
alone, so with an unexpected free
Saturday evening ahead, we leave the
Pico whirring away and hit the pub.
The next morning, the wort has
cooled overnight in the Pico Pro’s keg,
so I add a yeast packet and leave it to 
work its magic. Meanwhile, Andy
preps the traditional brew. Sufﬁce to

TRY DISTILLING WHISKEY
OR GIN INSTEAD OF BEER
Sure, brewing beer is pretty cool. But what if
you wanted to distil your own whiskey, vodka
or gin? (With a licence, of course.) That’s where
PicoBrew’s latest gadget comes in. Billed as “the
ultimate accessory for homebrewers and craft
distillers”, the PicoStill is a distilling attachment
designed to fit onto the newest Pico model, the
Pico C – but is compatible with any Pico, happily.
According to PicoBrew, it’ll produce 500ml of
spirits from a five-litre source - including vodka,
whiskey, bourbon, gin, brandy and schnapps.
The PicoStill is also geared up to extract the
essence of hops and other oils, and imbue food
and beverages with their distinct flavours. It isn’t
out yet - but you can preorder the PicoStill for
US$249, with shipping expected in early 2018.

Andy transfers the wort into a 30L
FastFerment Conical Fermenter – a
new style of fermenter that enables
primary and secondary fermentation
in the same container. This cuts out
the need for transfers and racking,
giving a cleaner fermentation with less
risk of oxidation or infection. Neat.
Next, Andy tests a sample of the
beer for gravity. Our wort density is
looking a little low, indicating that the
alcohol content will be less than we
expected. A quick aeration later using
the BrewFerm Wort Aeration Set to
add oxygen to the brew, and we’re
ready to pitch the yeast. To ferment
for the next two weeks, we strap on
Mangrove Jacks’ Dual Temperature
Controller. This is a handy device that
uses a heat belt or heat pad to control
the fermentation temperature of your
beer – it’s especially useful if you’re
brewing during a colder time of year.
The Pico Pro provides a serving
keg and tap, and the ability to force-
carbonate your beer makes the
process faster. By contrast, Andy
spent an hour spilling beer everywhere
while bottling his batch with a siphon.
DRINKING GAMES
So which tastes best? The Pico’s
Stingray is fantastic: it’s citrus-fused,
with ﬂoral overtones and a lovely
texture. Our IPA is cracking, too.
We’ve halted the carbonation process
early on this one for the sake of the
test, but it’s light and fruity and has
a pleasing malty sweetness that will 
continue to develop.
At $20-30 per PicoPak, the Pro
doesn’t make a cheaper schooner
than our homebrew (some quick
back-of-a-coaster maths puts a
schooner of Stingray at $2.50, while
our IPA comes out around $1.20). But
it is cheaper than the pub. And where
the Pico does win is on ease of use.
Sure, it doesn’t get the beer in your
hand any faster – fermentation takes
time – but the automation of the wort
is dramatically quicker, the complete
control offered is mind-blowing, and
the self-cleaning aspect is helpful.
Is the Pico Pro the holy grail of
home brewing? Well, no. If you’re
looking to experiment with your own,
unique recipes and gets hands-on with
the science and art of homebrewing, it
isn’t for you, sprry. But if you’re just
after a quick, easy way to pour a
party’s worth of tasty craft beer from
around the world in your own kitchen,
the Pico Pro is an astounding piece of
tech, and a fantastic introduction to 
what’s possible.

Making magic

he maxim about any
suﬃciently advanced 
technology being
indistinguishable from
magic never holds more true than at
Disneyland. Disneyland Paris has
been combining technology and
theatre since 1992 to create amazing
experiences for kids (and adults who
like a bit of staged spectacle in their
lives). Recently, some of the original 
attractions have been through a
“rehabbing”, where new technology
and old meet. As part of its 25th
anniversary celebrations in 2017,
Disneyland Paris invited T3 to tour
the upgraded rides and the most
recent all-new ride, and speak to the
Imagineers about what goes into
building and developing them.
Our guides are Björn Heerwagen
and Laurent Cayuela. Cayuela is a
Show Writer, part of the team that
works on concepts for attractions,
shows and entertainment. One of
his key areas is “show awareness”
training, which means helping to
show oﬀthe stories at the heart of 
Disneyland’s attractions. He’s
exactly as bubbly and eﬀusive as 
you’d expect from someone whose 
job is to build excitement.
Heerwagen is Senior Show Design
& Production Manager, and comes
across as much more pragmatic
and serious-minded, but with a
sharp sense of humour that he lets
slip every so often. He manages
almost everything that goes into
building a ride, to the point that he
oversees over 40 diﬀerent trades.
It’s quickly clear why they’re here
as a double act – when it comes to
making something in Disneyland, 
storytelling and building are
completely intertwined. First they
create the story, then ﬁnd or create
the technology needed to bring it to
life. Heerwagen explains that he also
works in a “tag team” with the Art
Director, Beth Clapperton, travelling
to trade shows and investigating
ways to realise rides together.
Rehabbing older attractions is an
especially delicate process, because
there’s also the history of the rides
to protect. When modernising a
ride, the results still have to feel the
same to guests who’ve been before,
even if a lot has changed. Two of the 
attractions that have had makeovers
are Pirates of the Caribbean and Star
Tours. Both were part of the park’s
opening line-up, based on versions
in the Californian Disneyland, and
each has a heady heritage, too: Star 
Tours was a collaboration with
George Lucas, while Pirates of the
Caribbean was the last ride Walt 
Disney worked on.
But with Pirates now a movie
franchise, and many more ﬁlms in
the Star Wars universe, the old
versions didn’t cut it any more. As
Cayuela explains, “Now, when kids
come to the park, they see Pirates of
the Caribbean and they expect the
characters from the movies.” And
leaving kids disappointed is not
exactly in Disneyland’s playbook.
So in 2017, Pirates was rehabbed
to make changes in everything from
the lighting to the characters and
the story that threads through it… 
but not too many changes.
“It’s important that guests can’t
tell the diﬀerent between what’s old
and new,” explains Heerwagen. He
says they have to “meet the original
intent” when rehabbing, which can

inform both what they change and what
they keep the same. For example, more
advanced animatronics are available now,
such as in the near-real Avatar robots being
developed for Walt Disney World in Florida, 
but they can’t suddenly use ultra-real
robotics for Captain Jack, because he has to
exist alongside the 25-year-old characters.
So a more ﬁttingly animated Jack appears a
few times in Pirates, including at one point
on a pile of 32,000 hand-placed gold coins
that hide his mechanisms – because that’s 
how things were built in Pirates.
In other areas, though, it was a chance to
fully modernise. The audio elements have
been upgraded, with new speakers that are
placed closer to the animatronics, so that the
sounds of them shouting have a better sense 
of presence. The lighting is all LED – a
change being made to all the rides over time, 
partly because of its heat and energy use
beneﬁts, and partly to unify their systems
as much as possible. Having 52 diﬀerent
attractions all running oﬀdiﬀerent systems
would be a logistical nightmare. The use of
lighting has also been tweaked to draw more
attention to the action in various scenes and 
dim lights on the scenery.
When Cayuela explains this, he adds
that this is why the queue to Pirates of the
Caribbean is very dimly lit: it cunningly
uses the time you’ll spend queueing to adjust
your eyes to the light level, so you can see 
better inside.
The queues are where the rides begin, in
more ways than one. Many attractions are
designed to give you a glimpse of the ride
itself near the start of the queue, so you get
an idea of what’s to come. But most rides also
have a story to them, and this always starts
in the queue, even if it’s only more of a light 
setting than a real narrative. 
TOUR DE FORCE
Star Tours is one of the rides that has a
full-on narrative, and had a much more
dramatic rehab process than Pirates. The
updated ride reopened earlier this year, now 
named Star Tours – The Adventure
Continues, and though many elements will
be familiar to people who’ve seen it before,
Heerwagen says that it was “pretty much
gutted,” and that they started from scratch 
with just the shell and ride technology.
The story starts in the entrance, designed 
to look like an airport departure lounge,
where visitors see R2-D2 and the ship that
they’ll be ‘ﬂying’ on, with C-3PO working
nearby - these are brand-new animatronics.
Later, droids work on processing luggage,
which is shown being scanned in 3D on a
screen. These droids can all be lowered down
shafts for maintenance, which is extremely
Star Wars in itself. A camera ‘scans’ guests
as they go by, which they can interact with
by waving and seeing themselves, while 
One of Pirates of the Caribbean’s most famous scenes goes from concept (top) to in-progress reality 
(above) – the programming tech doesn’t look quite as modern now as it did at the time…
nearby a ‘window’ (in reality, a screen)
shows Stormtroopers in the station – a taster
of the ride’s upcoming story.
The Star Tours ride section is now 3D,
using glasses designed in collaboration with
the Imagineering team, with the old 35mm
projectors replaced by 4K laser systems. It
looks stunning, but the genius part is that
it’s diﬀerent every time. There are well over
60 possible journeys that your ship can take,
in locations from various ﬁlms (“Continuity-
wise, I’m sure it is a big nightmare,” Cayuela
chuckles) with characters who may or may
not pop up during the journey. This is the
advantage of switching to digital, and these 
trips are all truly random – when the
operator presses ‘go’, the computer decides
what you’ll see, and the diﬀerences are huge.
This actually presented a big challenge for
Heerwagen’s team, because the ride sill uses 
the original 25-year-old hydraulics. Not
only was the task of creating ambitious new
ﬂights diﬃcult on older hardware, but the 
simulators aren’t identical anymore –
they’ve worn in slightly diﬀerent ways over
the years – so the movement eﬀects had to be 
individually calibrated on them. The ride
integration team spent 16 weeks riding the
simulators getting everything right, and is
facing another three weeks on there in the 
near future (they decline to say why).
Constraints like these present interesting
challenges for the rehabs – in some cases,
the limiting factor is the physical space. “On
new builds, you can say, ‘The building’s too
small! Make it bigger,’” says Heerwagen.

Making magic

But when rehabbing the ride Big Thunder
Mountain, the problem was the opposite.
“You can’t push the walls, you can’t push the 
ceiling,” he explains.
If there’s electronics or something they
need to ﬁt in but are struggling for space,
Heerwagen says there’s only one solution:
“Teamwork. To adapt and miniaturise.”
PARIS IN PARIS
The most recent brand-new attraction is
Ratatouille, and creating something from
nothing is a totally diﬀerent experience to 
the rehab process.
The idea of the ride is that you’re rat size,
having an adventure through a restaurant
kitchen. The journey is part physical, and
part video. You sit in rat-shaped cars, which
travel in packs of three. During the ride, you
move through areas like a giant larder ﬁlled 
with over-sized props, then switch
seamlessly into 3D domed movie displays,
and back. There’s even a heated oven and 
cold refrigerator to pass under.
At ﬁrst, the team explored doing the
whole thing with physical props instead of
any video, but Heerwagen says this came out
“kitsch,” so they had to ﬁnd another way.
“We’re allowed to fail a bit,” he says. “It’s
only through failure that you get success.”
Though he also adds that, if they’ve started
building a ride and something isn’t working,
it’s truly rare for ideas to be totally ditched: 
“It’s important that
guests can’t tell the
diﬀerence between
what’s old and new”
The sign for Gusteau’s is lowered into place outside Rataouille. To make it
look Pixar-like, all the straight lines in the ‘Parisian’ square are crooked
A trip past the radiator in Ratatouille brings a chill – the air-con system is
used to blast cold air here. Later in the ride, an oven gently heats you up
F E B R U A R Y / M A R C H  2 0 1 8
T3  67

“Once you’re building you’re too late into the
creative process to abandon it.”
After the decision to use projection video 
was made, there was another challenge:
making that work on the ride’s scale. Huge
domed screens that ﬁll the vision are used,
and these were created specially for the ride,
which meant developing suitable custom 
optics for the projectors.
For this level of development, full-scale
mock-ups of key parts of the ride are built.
In this case, screens were built in Glendale,
California, and Pixar animators were invited
from their base in Emeryville to view the
results, and give feedback on how the
animation looked. These meetings had a
hugely beneﬁcial impact on the development
of the projectors, and meant that the Pixar 
animators could create new scenes that 
were customised for the screens.
The projectors in Ratatouille are lamp-
based rather than Star Tours’ laser system,
because a few years ago, laser wasn’t at the
standard Disney required, though it has
since reached it. Ratatouille’s buildings were
going up while the screens were still being
polished. They could have waited, but like
any creative endeavour, rides are never
ﬁnished, only opened – you have to draw 
a line in the sand, says Heerwagen.
The 3D glasses used in Disneyland were
developed for Ratatouille – they’re the same 
as used in Star Tours. The team designed
them for easier stacking, so that more could
be shuttled around the park. They’re cleaned
using a specially developed ultrasound 
system, which is all housed within the 
Ratatouille buildings.
Another ﬁrst for the park is Ratatouille’s
rat cars, which don’t run on rails. They’re
guided by GPS, and the reason is that each
pack of three emulates the scurrying of rats 
throughout the ride, crossing over each
other’s paths and mixing up the order as you
go through the ride – there are actually 72
diﬀerent possible routes your car can take,
so just like Star Tours, you’ll end up with a
slightly diﬀerent story to anyone else who
visits. This seems to be a big focus for Disney
that new technology allows – the ﬂexibility
for everyone to have a unique experience.
The Ratatouille guided car technology is
based on existing standards for automated
warehouses, and was running on a test track
in Chicago for a year, before another eight
months of testing and integration in the ride.
Safety is paramount, naturally – cars stop
dead if they go more than 1.5m oﬀ course.
RIDE ON TIME
What’s the hardest part of all this work?
“Timing,” Heerwagen says simply. On the
opening of Ratatouille, he was tinkering
with the fountain outside an hour before
opening. On the other hand, Pirates was the
easiest re-opening he’d ever had – his team
wasn’t even working late the night before.
Heerwagen says his team is always
curious and trying new things out. Even the
subtlest things like weathered-eﬀect paints
don’t appear by magic – the team is always
working on long-term testing of techniques
and technology upgrades so they can leap on
unexpected advances. One example was the
rise of digital audio: during the development
of Space Mountain, they were able to add
on-board audio to the cars because they
could play sound from a hard drive for the
ﬁrst time – tape didn’t survive the rattling.
It wasn’t planned, but they jumped on it as
soon as it became viable. Still, even those 
new possibilities have to be right.
Virtual reality might seem like an obvious
route for a magical Disney experience in the
future, but Heerwagen is pretty cool on it. “It
has to enhance the experience,” he explains.
“We can’t just replace something with it.”
Given that it’s a limited social experience, he
says they would happily use VR, but only if it
was the only way to achieve the story they’re 
looking to tell. That’s the Disney way.
“We’re allowed to
fail a bit… it’s only
through failure that 
you get success”
Star Tours has been outﬁtted with brand-new animatronic characters and up-to-date laser projection. 
Disneyland can sometimes use off-the-shelf systems, but will usually still need to customise them

he iPhone X is the ﬁrst of a 
new breed of iPhones,
according to Apple. That’s
clear just by looking at it
– there’s no Home button, which isn’t 
just to accommodate the edge-to-
edge screen. Getting rid of one of the
iPhone’s few unchanged controls
since its launch ten years ago is a
statement. It seems small, but it has
a knock-on eﬀect, and when we ﬁrst
started using the X, we wondered if
we were ready for an all-gesture 
control scheme.
The ﬁrst thing that’s quite
surprising when you take the phone
out of the box is just how small it is,
especially coming to it from reviews
of the Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus – both
superb handsets, but big. Of course,
it’s not the iPhone X display that’s
small, but the body of the phone. It
feels a lot more like the iPhone 8 than
the 8 Plus, but its 5.8-inch display is
around the same size as the Plus’.
The materials used make the phone
feel super-premium, even if the glass
rear is a bit of a ﬁngerprint magnet.
The new glass-backed design means 
T
70 T3 F E B R U A R Y / M A R C H  2 0 1 8
Tested

that you can set the iPhone X down  
on a wireless charging pad and it’ll 
instantly start sucking up juice. It’s 
the universal ‘Qi’ standard as well, 
so you won’t need a special Apple 
wireless charger for this to work. 
Apple has the power to make 
technologies mainstream because of 
its ability to convince partners that 
‘now is the time’ to adopt. Integrating 
the Qi wireless standard at this stage 
is a phenomenal boost to wireless 
charging, even if others have been 
doing it for ages.
You can charge the handset up 
in around two hours normally, but 
connecting a USB-C to Lightning 
cable to a USB-C MacBook charger 
will give you fast charging, up to  
50 per cent in about half an hour.  
You can almost watch the battery 
percentage tick over as you charge 
(frustratingly you can no longer see 
the battery percentage in the status 
bar on the X – instead, you need to 
pull down the Control Centre).
We love the stainless-steel edge 
especially. The so-called ‘notch’ at the 
top of the screen is far from intrusive 
and houses plenty of necessary tech 
for Face ID. However, there is a bit of 
an issue with some apps not rendering
themselves correctly around the 
notch, while some apps – Safari 
notably – just use bars to make the 
screen a more conventional shape. 
Expect these quirks to get ironed out.
One touch
The second thing that’s surprising is 
the ﬁrst time you swipe up from the 
bottom of the display to go to the 
Home screen in iOS 11. It should feel 
weird, but we found it didn’t. Other 
reviewers said it took them days to get 
used to the lack of Home button, but 
we really weren’t troubled by it. Okay, 
we reached for a non-existent Home 
button a couple of times, but the move 
to gestures felt really natural.
We found ourselves signiﬁcantly 
more perturbed by other control 
changes – swiping down from the top 
right to get to the Control Centre is 
ﬁne, but our thumb didn’t quite 
stretch that far, so we needed two 
hands, or to jockey the handset 
slightly into position. Apple’s ‘Plus’ 
size Reachability feature to enable you 
to pull down stuﬀ at the top of the 
screen is no longer on by default, but 
it is there if you want it.
The side button is overused for 
features now there is no Home button. 
As well as putting your phone to 
sleep, it’s now co-opted for Siri (long 
press) and Apple Pay (two short 
presses). This works okay, but not 
brilliantly. To avoid accidental locks, 
you should switch to using ‘Hey Siri’ 
to invoke Apple’s assistant with your 
voice - we suspect that’s Apple’s 
intention, anyway.
Face time
One thing that isn’t complex is Face 
ID. You set it up during the initial 
iPhone conﬁguration and then, er, 
that’s it. Fifteen minutes after we 
started to use the phone we realised

that’s what Face ID is supposed to be
like. It’s brilliant, though we did ﬁnd 
it a little weird to have to make sure 
our face was available when using 
Apple Pay. 
Now, Samsung’s facial recognition 
isn’t that far removed from Face ID. 
We were impressed by the ease at 
which it unlocks the Note 8 recently. 
But it doesn’t do anything else. 
Because Face ID is so baked into iOS it 
means that you rarely need your 
passcode. And it’s not just about 
unlocking your phone with the 
that you’re really you before it
autoﬁlls in login details on websites 
on your behalf.
Ray of light
The 2436x1125 OLED screen seems 
markedly brighter when placed 
alongside the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus, 
though it’s apparently rated for the 
same brightness as the 8 Plus. The 
colours are gorgeous, and the rich 
OLED blacks are lovely to have.
The display also packs HDR and 
Dolby Vision support, which is very 
as is Apple’s True Tone 
y (also on the 8 phones). 
This monitors ambient light in the 
room, and calibrates the screen to 
make it more comfortable to use.
The iPhone X excels on the 
performance front thanks to Apple’s 
new A11 processor. This is the same 
chip used in the iPhone 8 and iPhone 
8 Plus, and it’s easily the fastest phone 
processor on the planet. 
We’ve found that the iPhone X 
battery life is broadly comparable 
with the iPhone 8 Plus. In real-world

YouTube and Netﬂix, and listening to 
high-quality streamed music from 
TIDAL and Apple Music over cellular, 
we found we were skipping through 
around ten per cent of battery per 
hour. Apple cites around 12 or 13 
hours of internet use or video 
playback, so we only found it was 
slightly worse than that.
The ﬁrst ten per cent does seem to 
disappear shockingly quickly though. 
In reality, for everyday use you will 
get through the working day and deep 
into the evening without needing to 
charge – we’re talking around 16-18 
hours of use, and we admit to being 
pretty heavy users. With lighter use, 
you’ll probably have about 20 per cent 
left at the end of a complete day. 
The front-facing TrueDepth 
camera is 7MP, and now features 
Portrait Mode. The depth perception 
of the TrueDepth cam (which also 
powers Face ID) ensures that selﬁes 
look superb. As with the iPhone 8 
Plus, you can also add other Portrait 
Lighting eﬀects. And as with the 8 
Plus, some of these modes work better 
than others – Stage Lighting in 
particular is rather patchy. 
The rear camera on the iPhone X is 
very similar to the one on the iPhone 
8 Plus, with some very small 
diﬀerences, notably optical image 
stabilisation (OIS) on the 2x telephoto
lens (the same as the Galaxy Note 8), 
which helps take improved shots with
the zoom in low light.
Take a shot
There’s a dual 12MP sensor 
array which produces some truly 
sensational shots. For taking zoomed-
in pictures, or capturing depth 
perception in a scene) the iPhone X 
has an f/2.4 aperture, where on the 
iPhone 8 Plus it’s f/2.8. There’s some 
clever technology at play here. For 
example, when zoomed in during 
really low light conditions, the 
wide-angle lens (instead of the zoom 
lens) is utilised to produce a better 
image. There is still a lot of noise in 
low-light conditions, but that’s 
inevitable for small phone sensors.
With good light, however, it’s hard 
to fault the photos from the iPhone X 
– they easily match the best results 
from any other phone camera.
As on the iPhone 8 Plus, the iPhone 
X can record 4K at 60 frames per 
second and the results are superb – 
supremely crisp and smooth. But, if 
you’re going to regularly record such 
high quality on your device, you’ll 
need a lot of storage space for it.
Is the iPhone X the best phone you 
can get right now? Yes, just. The 
Galaxy Note 8 is so close, while 
Apple’s own iPhone 8 Plus gives you 
much of the iPhone X beneﬁt without 
the expense – though we don’t think 
spending $1,600 on something you 
use all day, every day, is a problem. 
It’s the marriage of software and 
hardware that’s so eﬀective here, 
especially around Face ID. It’s what 
Apple’s still the best at.
We’re impressed The screen is astounding; 
the super-premium design is gorgeous; Face ID 
is a huge leap forward; the camera is epic. 
We’d improve Some interface quirks, 
especially around the notch; it is expensive.  
The last word The iPhone X has it all.  
As the most premium of premium phones, 
there’s none better.

Google Pixel 2
SMARTER PHONE
t seems Google is really
starting to deﬁne its vision
for the perfect Android
phone: pragmatic, quirky 
design, with killer software.
Let’s start with the design, which
has its good and bad parts. With a
ﬁve-inch screen, it’s a great size, and
easy to use one-handed. The phone
overall has a clear visual identity now,
with a larger glass panel on the rear
that stretches around the edges of the 
device, and chamfered bezels.
Oddly, it feels like it’s made from
plastic, though it does feel as solid as a
rock. Compared to the almost ceramic-
like iPhone 8’s glass back, it feels kind
of cheap despite being premium. That 
said, it’s the most grippy ﬂagship
phone out there, which we like.
We also need to talk about those
giant bezels at the top and bottom of
the phone, which are so egregiously 
large, we’re not sure if Google is
trolling us here in the year of bezel-
lessness, 2017. We can live with them,
as we did on the iPhone 8, but it does
make us wish the slim-edged design of
the six-inch Pixel 2 XL was used on the
smaller phone – but we’ll talk more 
about the XL version later.
At least within those bezels, the
Pixel 2 has been given a signiﬁcant
upgrade in the display department,
with a more vibrant-looking OLED
display (though still Full HD, which is
brilliant sharp at ﬁve inches). It also
features an ambient ‘Always On’
display, which continues to show key
information and notiﬁcations even
when the screen is theoretically oﬀ.
This is a nice touch but has been seen
before, though it’s executed nicely
here, and includes a feature to tell
you what song is playing in the
background, like an instant Shazam.

There’s little special inside the
Google Pixel 2 – powering it is the
same Snapdragon 835 and 4GB RAM
found inside most other smartphones.
It’s a fast device, on par with other
Android ﬂagships. Multitasking,
playing music, watching video and
browsing the web are all eﬀortless.
What Google wants to emphasise is
the software running on that standard
hardware. The Pixel 2 comes with an
updated version of Google’s Pixel
launcher on top of Android Oreo. It
features a smarter Google Assistant,
and now Google Lens as well, which
lets you tap on things in a photo (or
Assistant’s camera mode) to identify
and ﬁnd information about them – the
phone recognises them for you.
It’s still very close to stock Android,
but it comes with some beautifully
simple changes which make operating
easier, especially with one hand.
Elsewhere in the specs department,
the Google Pixel 2 comes with 64GB or
128GB storage, Bluetooth 5, and a
2,700mAh battery with fast charging.
Despite the small battery, we found
the battery life of the Pixel 2 is actually
pretty impressive, easily lasting a day.
It’s worth noting, due to the metal 
design, the Pixel 2 doesn’t feature
wireless charging. That’s not a major
issue right now, as it still hasn’t hit the 
big time yet, but it’s still a shame.
One lens, no problems
The original Google Pixel had quite 
simply the best camera in any
smartphone for the best part of a year,
so we were really excited to see what
the Pixel 2 would bring to the table.
You get a 12-megapixel sensor, with
an f/1.8 aperture and optical image
stabilisation. Google’s also tinkered
with the software, to improve the 
results and add features.
The result is a big improvement,
with the camera capable of taking
some stunning shots, and, most
importantly, doing that reliably.
Unlike the many of its competitors,
Google has decided against adding a
dual camera set-up to the Pixel 2.
Despite the lack of hardware that you’d
ﬁnd on other phones, the Pixel 2 still
features a portrait mode which blurs
the background. This works on both
the rear and front cameras, and is
really impressive, matching up to the
similar modes in the Galaxy Note8 and 
iPhone 8 Plus.
The main thing about this camera is
that it just does a fantastic job of letting 
the light in, resulting in amazing
low-light pictures and stunningly
vibrant and crisp results in sunlight. 
This is especially obvious in high
contrast scenes – it balances the
shadows and light brilliantly for a
gorgeous HDR eﬀect. It’s as good as 
any other smartphone camera.
The shadow over the Pixel 2 is its
own sibling, the Pixel 2 XL. It would 
be our pick, but early units have
problems with screen colour issues
and even screen burn-in. Without
more time to see how widespread
these issues are, we have to hold oﬀ
from recommending it. But if you
want a one-handed phone with a killer
camera, the Pixel 2 is ready to comply.

he days of the traditional
router may be numbered. 
We all live in complex
homes. We all have those
corners that stubbornly refuse to give 
up a decent signal. And most of us
have to put up with an awkwardly-
located central access point, which
just makes solving the problem more
diﬃcult. There are options out there
like powerline and Wi-Fi repeaters,
but mesh networks do it better: they 
send signal between individual
nodes, usually using a dedicated
radio channel, meaning you can place
them in those murky areas of your
home that really need the boost. Still

Netgear’s high-end kit gets pretty much
everything right when it comes to mesh
networking. Perhaps its most notable
advantage is its tri-band support. Where
most mesh kits use the same radio channel
for communicating between mesh nodes
as they do for regular communications, the
Orbi RBK50 has a channel devoted entirely
to relaying data between the satellite(s) and

olby Atmos, the next-gen audio
system, seems to be everywhere.
It’s fast becoming ubiquitous on
Blu-ray, is gaining support from
Netﬂix and even features on XBox One X games.
However, if you want to hear it at home, you’ve
been limited to expensive ﬂoorstanders and
faced adding Dolby Enabled speakers to existing
systems, or buying an Atmos soundbar.
This Focal system changes all that. A 5.1.2
system, the package comprises three basic Sib
Evo satellites (two for rear deployment, one to
sit horizontally as a centre), two larger Sib Evo
Dolby Atmos speakers for left/right, and the
cute Cub Evo Subwoofer. Neatly, the Sib Evo
Atmos speakers combine front-ﬁring speaker
drivers, with full-range up-ﬁrers for audio.
All satellites can be wall-mounted, parked
on optional matching ﬂoor stands, or placed
atop teetering towers of old T3s. Just add a Dolby
Atmos AV receiver and you’re good to go.

The good news is that once installed, they
sound convincingly cinematic. The cool thing
about Dolby Atmos is that it has a remarkably
eﬀective upmix function for non-encoded
content; so the full driver complement is always
in use. Even with regular surround mixes, you 
get a sense of heightened immersion.
The compact sub and satellites seamlessly
integrate, and generate a huge soundstage.
There’s a delicious sense of spatial movement,
around and overhead. When the War Boys give
chase to Max in Mad Max Fury Road, there’s a
guttural roar from the pursuing V8s, directional 
steering around and overheard is superb.
The speakers also boast a nice mid-range
which oﬀers rounded, clear dialogue. The bass
performance of the cute Cub sub is profound, 
too - that little box can sure slam.
The Sib Evo set isn’t just about movies. The
system can hold a tune. Tight and melodious,
there’s no obvious disconnect between the sub 
and satellites.
Overall, we rate Focal’s Sib Evo as a cracking
solution to the conundrum of 3D audio. It leads
in a class of one (for the time being), a real way
to get proper height-ﬁ into your living room.

really forged the popular 2-in-1 form factor, but
the Switch 5 has one major drawcard over the
similarly-specced Surface Pro – it costs $500
less. Despite this considerable discount, Acer 
has actually cut costs in clever areas to
minimise the diﬀerence in performance.
The most obvious is a slightly smaller screen
that has a resolution of 2,160 x 1,440 pixels to
the Surface Pro’s 2,736 x 1,824 display, which
deﬁnitely makes it less vibrant but doesn’t
reduce pixel density and picture quality that
noticeably. The Surface Pro does considerably
outperform the Switch 5 in more GPU intensive 
workloads (creatives, take note). While the
Switch 5’s lower pixel count will mean it drains
less battery, it only has a 38Wh Li-Ion battery to
the Surface Pro’s 45Wh unit, oﬀering around 
ﬁve hours of power.
The Switch 5’s pen, keyboardand kickstand
have been reverse engineered to be close to
Microsoft’s oﬀering, and unless you’ve become
accustomed to the Surface Pen, you’re unlikely 
to notice the diﬀerence.

The convenience of inductive charging carries a
premium: most phones have a quick-charge option
they either come with an adapter for, or you can
buy for about $40 that will charge them faster. It’s 
much less cool, admittedly.
CHARGING
This took the same amount of time to charge an
iPhone X as the Mophie, but again, worked ﬁne. As
a sign of how wireless power works, they’re only a 
tiny bit faster than using the wired 5W iPhone
adapter, not the 50% faster you might expect. 
DESIGN
Mophie’s charger is mostly rubber-coated, so it’s
grippy on a tabletop. It has a smaller diameter than
the Belkin, so larger phones overhang. In practice,
you’ll want to leave room to avoid knocks to your
phone whichever mat you choose.
POWER ADAPTER
Mophie’s base has a rounded outer edge. The cable
slots into a recessed port and has a ﬂush ﬁnish at
the mat’s edge. Unlike the Belkin, the cable runs
into the plug’s bottom. The light on the base’s front
is arguably more discreet, but a little harder to see.
VALUE
Beyond their outward appearance, the two mats
are very similar, with an identical price tag, so it all
hinges on if you want to pay for convenience.
However, this mat’s size is a little conservative
for phones with a screen over 5.5 inches.
CHARGING
The Qi standard is 5W of charging power, but both
these pads provide 7.5W for iPhone 8/X only.
Anything Qi-compatible will work with both pads
at the lower range. An iPhone X goes from 0 to
100% in three and a half hours from this pad.

oPro’s had some ups and downs
recently, but that hasn’t stopped it
pushing the boundaries of what its
action cameras can do. Its latest, the
HERO6 Black, comes with a raft of new tech to
make your adventures look better than ever.
With a new processor inside, dubbed GP1,
it can record video at frame rates previously
thought impossible in such a small form factor.
It also boasts waterprooﬁng down to 10
metres without a case – ﬁrst seen in the HERO5
Black – and it’s tough too, with a rubberised
ﬁnished that screams ‘go break me if you can’.
In testing we dropped it onto concrete from 10
feet, minus a case, and we lost that challenge.
There’s new Wi-Fi support for the 5GHz band
too, which means faster transfer of these bigger,
higher quality video ﬁles. We did struggle to
connect to some phones, however, and could 
only transfer using the slower 2.4GHz 
connnection in such cases.
While the HERO6 Black looks much like the
GoPro you know and love, it now features a
full-colour, two-inch touchscreen with

sensitivity that actually works well, when not in
gloves at least. It’s more responsive and colours
are noticeably punchier than the HERO5. Voice
controls are back on the HERO6 Black, meaning 
you can tell it to start a recording or power
down without your busy hands getting
distracted. In reality, this works well indoors
but can struggle if you’re outside with wind.
Shooting is now possible in 4K with up to
60fps, and you’ve got the option of slow-motion
120fps at 2.7K resolution or super slow-motion
240fps at 1080p. This is also all recorded using
the latest HEVC (h.265) codec (as featured in the
iPhone X), which is great for smaller ﬁles and
faster transfers, but does mean some older 
devices struggle to play it.
While 4K at 60fps sounds great, image
stabilisation only works at 30fps. If you want
smoother playback, you’ll need a Karma Grip
– or other gimbal - for physical stabilisation.
Then there’s battery - with mixed use we
were getting about two hours of useage, but at
4K 60fps you’re realistically only going to get
around 45 minutes before the battery gives up.

ne of our favourite things
about the PlayStation VR is
how it works with non-VR
content, displaying it on a
ﬂoating screen in front of you, as if you
were in a cinema. You get a personal
space to watch movies, or play 2D
games, without taking over the TV.
That’s why we were so excited to try
the Royole Moon, which aims to do the
same thing, though without the VR
elements. It has twin OLED 1080p
displays that sit just in front of your
eyes, replicating the feeling of sitting 
O
No,it’snotaVRheadset–meetthe
Android-poweredpersonal‘mobile
theatre’thatgivesyouavirtual
cinema screen to watch anywhere
Royole Moon
YOUR OWN CINEMA
in front of an 800-inch screen, so you
can watch videos without distraction.
Cleverly, and unlike a VR headset,
it’s an all-in-one system, with great
headphones built in, and powered by  
a small connected box that runs
Android, so it’s pretty much a
phone-less smartphone where the
screen sits right on your head. This
means it has a built-in battery too, so
you can use it anywhere. We found the
battery was good for a little under six 
hours of use, which is impressive.
You’ve got a good range of sources
for movies – you can watch video ﬁles
from its internal storage, or attach a
USB drive to it and watch from there,
or even plug a HDMI cable into it to
play a games console on it. And on top 
of that, it has Wi-Fi and, being
Android, you can install apps like 
Netﬂix to stream to it.
Which all sounds fantastic! And it
nearly is, but if it seems like you’re
being oﬀered the Moon on stick, you
kind of are – as is often the case, it’s  
all about the details.
Picture perfect
Before we get to where the Moon
stumbles, let’s start with one area it
absolutely nails: the image quality is
just beautiful. A 1920x1080 display for
each eye means things look incredibly
detailed (you can just about see the
pixels on text, but that’s no problem), 
and the vividness of colours is
stunning, as is the depth of blacks,

even when you’re staring right into the 
screen. On the menus, some ghosting 
(one image showing through into 
another after the ﬁrst image has 
changed) was apparent, but it didn’t 
seem to be a problem in movies or 
games, when it matters.
It also works well for glasses 
wearers – you don’t need them! Its 
lenses are easily adjustable to get 
things looking sharp for your 
prescription and pupil width.
That said, when you’re setting it up, 
you’ll encounter one of its problems, 
which is that the lack of a strap at the 
rear of your head makes it easy to get 
the screen position slightly oﬀ – only 
the band that goes on top of your dome 
and padding around the eyepieces 
hold it in place. This makes it easy to 
put on, but not to put on correctly, so 
you might realise you’re trying to get 
the image sharp when it’s actually not 
in quite the right spot. It also results in 
a bit more light leaking in than we’d 
like, and makes it less comfortable for 
long periods than the likes of the 
PlayStation VR, though Royole 
recommends a break every hour 
anyway (you can set the system to 
remind you about this).
And you may well ﬁnd yourself 
wanting that break, because we did 
ﬁnd the Moon could be uncomfortable
on our eyes at times. A big part of it 
is how far you have to move your eyes 
to focus on anything not in the centre 
– they’re just not used to it. In a 
cinema or on PS VR, you can move 
your head to help them, but not here; 
the screen is ﬁxed in the centre of your
vision. You can adjust how large the 
screen appears in your vision using the
menus, and this helped for games 
especially (Royole does warn about 
this), but it lessens the cinema impact 
when you make the screen smaller.
Wrong gesture
Speaking of the menus, you control 
them using gestures on a touch panel 
on the right speaker cup, and we’re  
not fans. Entering any text with it is a 
nightmare, especially a Wi-Fi 
password (and this is the ﬁrst time 
we’ve ever had to use the WPS button 
on the side of our router to connect 
something, which added confusion). 
You can actually attach a USB mouse to 
make it easier, but no one ever will.
Similarly awkward is getting new 
apps onto the Moon – you don’t do it 
through an app store, but instead by 
downloading APK packages to your 
PC, then transferring them over to the 
Moon. So, if you want Netﬂix, you’d 
have to do this – the only built-in app 
is YouTube. But this reveals other 
problems, like Amazon Prime Video 
not even being on Royole’s suggested 
download site. It’s far from slick.
If you’re planning to use the Moon 
for its basic movie-watching function, 
and are planning to load your own 
content, or don’t mind the clumsy app 
support, it’s a good device – nicely 
constructed, the image quality really 
is terriﬁc, and there’s even 3D support, 
which works ﬁne. And we love that it’s 
portable. But it needs more polish.

es, these are pricey speakers (the
original LS50s were $1,800 cheaper),
but let’s put it this way - if you buy
these Wireless versions, you don’t
have to buy an amp or streamer. Nor do you
have to ﬁnd a space in your lounge to house
them. That’s because all the necessary hardware 
is neatly integrated. The result? Two simple
boxes oﬀering the sort of sound that makes 
bigger, more complex systems blush.
The added hardware of an amp and heatsink
on each speaker has made them a bit bigger than 
the originals at the back, but otherwise they
still look stunning, with their curved front.
Playing your favourite tunes is also
uncomplicated - using the companion app you
stream tunes from Tidal, your local library,
or from a media server. Or you can switch
sources and use Bluetooth. Either way, you’ll
be rewarded with scintillating sound. The app’s
clever room correction settings let you adjust
the EQ of the speakers to suit whatever space 
they’re in. Bass performance in Tricky’s
Black Steel is room-shaking stuﬀ, but nicely
controlled, while Michael Jackson’s Wanna Be
Startin Something reveals perfectly balanced
sound. In Dead Combo’s After Peace, Swim
Twice, we’re convinced there’s a Telecaster
being plucked right in front of us, such is the 
level of instrumental realism. 
All the performance without

s you’d expect from a camera
that costs the same as a decent
second-hand hatchback, the
D850 is a beast. With weather
sealing and a chunky handgrip, this is a
camera which can handle some scrapes.
Buttons and dials adorn the D850, giving
you instant access to all your most-needed
settings. Your thumb naturally falls upon
the handy joystick to set the AF point
when you’re shooting through the bright
viewﬁnder (the largest magniﬁcation ever 
found on a Nikon DSLR by the way).
Alternatively, you’ve got the 3.2-inch
screen, which, still relatively unusually
for a full-frame DSLR, tilts and is touch-
sensitive. A new silent mode means you can
shoot without making a sound if you need to
remain discreet - weddings, for example.

The D850 uses the same speedy and
accurate AF (autofocus) system as the
top-of-the-line D5. Unlike compact system
cameras, all of the AF points are clustered
towards the centre of the frame - sometimes
you need to focus and recompose. A minor 
niggle, but an annoyance at times.
Nikon’s Snapbridge functionality is great
for quickly transferring your shots across to 
your mobile phone ready for sharing on
social networking sites and the like. That is 
when it wants to play ball - there are
occasions when it seems the Bluetooth
connection just doesn’t want to co-operate.
Image quality is frankly superb. Detail, as
you’d probably expect from an oﬀering of 45
megapixels, is resolved in super-ﬁne detail,
while colours are nicely saturated with great 
dynamic range. The high ISO, low-light
performance is also impressive, particularly
for something boasting so many megapixels. 
Exposures are nicely balanced, while
automatic white balance produces accurate 
colours in the majority of cases.

XIAOMI MI BAND 2

Although there’s a lack of integrated GPS and
the band feels cheap compared to the others,
Xiaomi’s superbly priced tracker gives
admirable performance for its featherweight
price. Of course, the 0.42-inch OLED screen is
fuzzy compared to the Samsung, but it
displays time, calories, steps and heart rate
adequately enough. The Mi Band 2 is also
good in bed, keenly spotting when you drop
off and wake up. Steps and heart rate tracking
are less accurate, yet in the right ballpark.
Auto-recognition can be sluggish, but a
claimed 20-day battery life is promising.
