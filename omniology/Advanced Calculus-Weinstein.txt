About the Course
Welcome to Advanced Calculus! In this course, you will learn Analysis, that
is the theory of diﬀerentiation and integration of functions.
However, you will
also learn something more fundamental than Analysis.
You will learn what is
a mathematical proof. You may have seen some proofs earlier, but here, you will
learn how to write your own proofs. You will also learn how to understand someone
else’s proof, ﬁnd a ﬂaw in a proof, ﬁx a deﬁcient proof if possible and discard it if
not. In other words you will learn the trade of mathematical exploration.
Mathematical reasoning takes time. In Calculus, you expected to read a prob-
lem and immediately know how to proceed. Here you may expect some frustration
and you should plan to spend a lot of time thinking before you write down anything.
Analysis was not discovered overnight. It took centuries for the correct approach to
emerge. You will have to go through an accelerated process of rediscovery. Twenty
hours of work a week outside class is not an unusual average for this course.
The course is run in the following way. In these notes, you will ﬁnd Deﬁnitions,
Theorems, and Examples. I will explain the deﬁnitions. At home, on your own,
you will try to prove the theorems and the statements in the examples. You will
use no books and no help from anyone. It will be just you, the pencil and the
paper. Every statement you make must be justiﬁed. In your arguments, you may
use any result which precedes in the notes the item you are proving. You may use
these results even if they have not yet been proven. However, you may not use
results from other sources. Then, in class, I will call for volunteers to present their
solutions at the board. Every correct proof is worth one point. If more than one
person volunteer for an item, the one with the fewest points is called to the board,
ties to be broken by lot. Your grade will be determined by the number of points
you have accumulated during the term.
You have to understand the proofs presented by others.
Some of the ideas
may be useful to you later. You must question your peers when you think a faulty
argument is given or something is not entirely clear to you. If you don’t, I most
probably will. When you are presenting, you must make sure your arguments are
clear to everyone in the class. If your proof is faulty, or you are unable to defend
it, the item will go to the next volunteer, you will receive no credit, and you may
not go up to the board again that day. We will work on the honor system, where
you will follow the rules of the game, and I will not check on you.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction
1. Mathematical Proof
What is a proof? To explain, let us consider an example.
Theorem 1.1. There is no rational number r which is a square root of 2.
This theorem was already known to the ancient Greeks. It was very important
to them since they were particularly interested in geometry, and, as follows from
the Theorem of Pythagoras, a segment of length
√
2 can be constructed as the
hypotenuse of a right triangle with both sides of length 1.
Before we prove this theorem, in fact before we prove any theorem, we must
understand its statement. To understand its statement, we must understand each
of the terms used. For instance: what is a rational number? For this we need a
deﬁnition.
Definition 1.1. A number r is rational if it can be represented as the ratio of
two integers:
r = n
m
(1.1)
where m ̸= 0.
Of course, in this deﬁnition, we are using other terms that need to be deﬁned,
such as number, ratio, integer. We will not dwell on this point, and instead assume
for now that these have been deﬁned previously. However, already one point is clear.
If we wish to be absolutely rigorous, we must begin from some given assumptions.
We will call these axioms. They do not require proof. We will discuss this point
further later. For the time being, let us assume that we have a system of numbers
where the usual operations of arithmetic are deﬁned.
Next we need to deﬁne what we mean by a square root of 2.
Definition 1.2. Let y be a number. The number x is a square root of y if
x2 = y.
Again, we assume that the meaning of x2 is understood. Note that we have
said a square root, and not the square root. Indeed if x ̸= 0 is a square root of
y, then −x is another one. Note that then, one of the two numbers x and −x is
positive. Now, we may give the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that x is a square root of 2,
and that x is rational. Clearly, x ̸= 0, hence we may assume that x > 0. Then,
x2 = 2, and there are integers n, m ̸= 0, such that
x = n
m.
(1.2)

1. INTRODUCTION
Of course there are many such pairs n, and m. In fact, if n and m is any such pair,
then 2n and 2m is another pair. Also, there is one pair in which n > 0. Among
all these pairs, with n > 0, pick one for which n is the smallest positive integer
possible, i.e., x = n/m, n > 0, and if x = k/l then n 6 k. We have:
 n
m
2
= 2,
(1.3)
or equivalently
n2 = 2m2.
(1.4)
Thus, 2 divides n2 = n · n. It follows that 2 divides n, i.e. n is even. We may
therefore write n = 2k and thus
n2 = 4k2 = 2m2,
(1.5)
or equivalently
2k2 = m2.
(1.6)
Now, 2 divides m2, hence m is even. Write m = 2l. We obtain
x = n
m = 2k
2l = k
l .
(1.7)
But k is positive and clearly k < n, a contradiction. Thus no such x exists, and
the theorem is proved.
A close examination of this proof will be instructive. The ﬁrst observation is
that the proof is by contradiction. We assumed that the statement to be proved
is false, and we reached an absurdity. Here the statement to be proved was that
there is no rational x for which x2 = 2, so we assumed there is one such x. The
absurdity was that we could certainly take x = n/m, with n > 0 and as small as
possible, but we deduced x = k/l with 0 < k < n. Next, we see that each step
follows from the previous one, and possibly some additional information. Take for
example, the argument immediately following (1.4). If 2 divides n2 then 2 divides
n. This seemingly obvious fact requires justiﬁcation. We will not do this here; it
is done in algebra, and relies on the unique factorization by primes of the integers.
It is extremely important to identify the information which you import into your
proof from outside. Usually, this is done by quoting a known theorem. Remember
that before you quote a theorem, you must check its hypotheses.
Read this proof again and again during the term. Try to ﬁnd its weak points,
those points which could use more justiﬁcation. Try to improve it. Try to imagine
how it was discovered.
2. Set Theory and Notation
In this section, we brieﬂy recall some notation and a few facts from set theory.
If A is a set of objects and x is an element of A, we will write x ∈A. If B is another
set and every element of B is an element of A, we say that B is a subset of A, and
we write B ⊂A. In other words, B ⊂A if and only if x ∈B implies that x ∈A.
This is how one usually checks if B ⊂A, i.e., pick an arbitrary element x ∈B and
show that x ∈A. The meaning of arbitrary here is simply that the only fact we
know about x is that x ∈B. Note also that we have used the words if and only if,

2. SET THEORY AND NOTATION

which mean that the two statements are equivalent. We will abbreviate if and only
if by iﬀ. For example, if A and B are two sets, then A = B iﬀA ⊂B and B ⊂A.
This is usually the way one checks that two sets A and B are equal: A ⊂B and
B ⊂A. Again, we are learning early an important lesson: break a proof into smaller
parts. In these notes, you will ﬁnd that I have tried to break the development of
the material into the proof of a great many small facts.
However, in the more
diﬃcult problems, you might want to continue this process further on your own,
i.e., decompose the harder problems into a number of smaller problems. Try to
take the proof of Theorem 1.1 and break it into the proof of several facts. Think
about how you could have guessed that these were intermediate steps in proving
Theorem 1.1.
We will also use the symbol ∀to mean for every, and the symbol ∃to mean
there is. Finally we will use ∅to denote the empty set, the set with no elements,
Let A and B be sets, their intersection, which is denoted by A∩B, is the set of
all elements which belong to both A and B. Thus, x ∈A ∩B iﬀx ∈A and x ∈B.
If A ∩B = ∅we say that A and B are disjoint. Similarly, their union, denoted
A ∪B, is the set of all elements which belong to either A or B (or both), so that
x ∈A ∪B iﬀx ∈A or x ∈B.
Theorem 1.2. Let A, B, and C be sets. Then
(A ∩B) ∪C = (A ∪C) ∩(B ∪C).
(1.8)
Theorem 1.3. Let A, B, and C be sets. Then
(A ∪B) ∩C = (A ∩C) ∪(B ∩C).
(1.9)
If A is a subset of X, then the complement of A in X is the set X \ A which
consists of all the elements of X which do not belong to A, i.e. x ∈X \ A iﬀx ∈X
and x ̸∈A. If X is understood, then the complement is also denoted Ac. The
notation X \ A is occasionally used also when A is not a subset of X. However, in
this case X \ A is not called the complement of A in X.
Let X and Y be sets. The set of all pairs (x, y) with x ∈X and y ∈Y is called
the Cartesian product of X and Y , and is written X × Y . A subset f of X × Y
is a function, if for each x ∈X there is a unique y ∈Y such that (x, y) ∈f. The
last statement includes two conditions, existence and uniqueness. These are often
treated separately. Thus f ⊂X × Y is a function iﬀ:
(i) ∀x ∈X, ∃y ∈Y , such that (x, y) ∈f;
(ii) If (x, y1) ∈f, and (x, y2) ∈f, then y1 = y2.
To simplify the notation, we will write y = f(x) instead of (x, y) ∈f. If f ⊂X ×Y
is a function, we write f : X →Y . We call X the domain of f, and say that f
maps X to Y . The set of y ∈Y such that ∃x ∈X for which y = f(x) is called the
range of f, and will be written as Ran(f).
Let f : X →Y . If A ⊂X, we deﬁne the function f|A: A →Y , called the
restriction of f to A by setting (f|A)(x) = f(x) for every x ∈A. We deﬁne the set
f(A) ⊂Y by
f(A) = {y ∈Y : ∃x ∈A, f(x) = y}
= {f(x): x ∈A}.
(1.10)
In other words f(A) = Ran(f|A).

1. INTRODUCTION
Theorem 1.4. Let f : X →Y , and A, B ⊂X, then
f(A ∪B) = f(A) ∪f(B).
(1.11)
Theorem 1.5. Let f : X →Y , and A, B ⊂X, then
f(A ∩B) ⊂f(A) ∩f(B).
(1.12)
Example 1.1. Equality does not always hold in (1.12).
If A ⊂Y , we deﬁne the pre-image of A under f, denoted f −1(A) ⊂X, by:
f −1(A) = {x ∈X : f(x) ∈A}.
(1.13)
Theorem 1.6. Let f : X →Y , and A, B ⊂Y , then
f −1(A ∪B) = f −1(A) ∪f −1(B).
(1.14)
Theorem 1.7. Let f : X →Y , and A, B ⊂Y , then
f −1(A ∩B) = f −1(A) ∩f −1(B).
(1.15)
A function f : X →Y is onto (or surjective) if Ran(f) = Y .
A function
f : X →Y is one-to-one (or injective) if f(x1) = f(x2) implies that x1 = x2. If f
is both one-to-one and onto, we say that f is bijective. Then there exists a unique
function g such that g(f(x)) = x for all x ∈X, and f(g(y)) = y for all y ∈Y . The
function g is denoted f −1, and is called the inverse of f.
Example 1.2. Let f : X →Y be bijective, and let f −1 be its inverse. Then
∀y ∈Y :
f −1({y}) = {f −1(y)}
(1.16)
Caution: part of the problem here is to explain the notation. In particular,
the notation is abused in the sense that f −1 on the left-hand side has a diﬀerent
meaning than on the right-hand side.
3. Induction
Induction is an essential tool if we wish to write rigorous proof using repetitions
of an argument an unknown number of times.
In a more elementary course, a
combination of words such as ‘and so on’ could probably be used. Here, this will
not be acceptable. We will denote by N the set of natural numbers, i.e. the counting
numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , and by Z the integers, i.e., the natural numbers, their negatives,
and zero.
Axiom 1 (Well-Ordering Axiom). Let ∅̸= S ⊂N. Then S contains a smallest
element.
As the name indicates, we will take this as an axiom. No proof need be given.
However, we will prove the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
Theorem 1.8 (The Principle of Mathematical Induction). Suppose that S ⊂
N satisﬁes the following two conditions:
(i) 1 ∈S.
(ii) If n ∈S then n + 1 ∈S.
Then S = N.

4. THE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM
9
We will denote by P(n) a statement about integers. You may want to think
of P(n) as a function from Z to {0, 1} (0 represents false, 1 represents true.) P(n)
might be the statement: n is odd; or the statement: the number of primes less than
or equal to n is less then n/ log(n).
Theorem 1.9. Let P(n) be a statement depending on an integer n, and let
n0 ∈Z. Suppose that
(i) P(n0) is true;
(ii) If n > n0 and P(n) is true, then P(n + 1) is true.
Then P(n) is true for all n ∈Z such that n > n0.
This last result is what we usually refer to as Mathematical Induction. Here is
an application.
Example 1.3. Let n ∈N, then
n
X
k=1
(2k −1) = n2
(1.17)
See Theorem 2.13, and Equation (2.6) for a precise deﬁnition of the summa-
tion’s P notation.
4. The Real Number System
In a course on the foundations of mathematics, one would construct ﬁrst the
natural numbers N, then the integers Z, then the rational numbers Q, and then
ﬁnally the real numbers R. However, this is not a course on the foundations of
mathematics, and we will not labor on these constructions. Instead, we will assume
that we are given the set of real numbers R with all the properties we need. These
will be stated as axioms. Of course, you probably already have some intuition as
to what real numbers are, and these axioms are not meant to substitute for that
intuition. However, when writing your proofs, you should make sure that all your
statements follow from these axioms, and their consequences proved so far only.
The set of real numbers R is characterized as being a complete ordered ﬁeld.
Thus, the axioms for the real numbers are divided into three sets. The ﬁrst set
of axioms, the ﬁeld axioms, are purely algebraic. The second set of axioms are
the order axioms. It is extremely important to note that Q satisﬁes the axioms
in the ﬁrst two sets. Thus Q is an ordered ﬁeld. Nevertheless, if one wishes to
do analysis, the rational numbers are totally inadequate. Another ordered ﬁeld is
given in the appendix. The last axiom required in order to study analysis is the
Least Upper Bound Axiom. An ordered ﬁeld which satisﬁes this last axiom is said
to be complete. I suggest that at ﬁrst, you try to understand, or rather recognize,
the ﬁrst two sets of axioms.
Axiom 2 (Field Axioms). For each pair x, y ∈R, there is an element denoted
x+y ∈R, called the sum of x and y, such that the following properties are satisﬁed:
(i) (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) for all x, y, z ∈R.
(ii) x + y = y + x for all x, y ∈R.
(iii) There exists an element 0 ∈R, called zero, such that x+0 = x for all x ∈R.
(iv) For each x ∈R there is an element denoted −x ∈R such that x + (−x) = 0.

10
1. INTRODUCTION
Furthermore, for each pair x, y ∈R, there is an element denoted xy ∈R, and called
the product of x and y, such that the following properties are satisﬁed:
(v) (xy)z = x(yz) for all x, y, z ∈R.
(vi) xy = yx for all x, y ∈R.
(vii) There exists a non-zero element 1 ∈R such that 1 · x = x for all x ∈R.
(viii) For all non-zero x ∈R, there is an element denoted x−1 ∈R such that
xx−1 = 1.
(ix) For all x, y, z ∈R, (x + y)z = xz + yz.
Any set which satisﬁes the above ﬁeld axioms is called a ﬁeld. Using these, it
is possible to prove that all the usual rules of arithmetic hold.
Example 1.4. Let X = {x} be a set containing one element x, and deﬁne the
operations + and · in the only possible way. Is X a ﬁeld?
Example 1.5. Let X = {0, 1}, and deﬁne the addition and multiplication
operations according to the following tables:
+
0
1
0
0
1
1
1
0
·
0
1
0
0
0
1
0
1
Prove that X is a ﬁeld.
Axiom 3 (Ordering Axioms). There is a subset P ⊂R, called the set of posi-
tive numbers, such that:
(x) 0 ̸∈P.
(xi) Let 0 ̸= x ∈R. If x ̸∈P then −x ∈P, and if x ∈P then −x ̸∈P.
(xii) If x, y ∈P, then xy, x + y ∈P.
A ﬁeld with a subset P satisfying the ordering axioms is called an ordered ﬁeld.
Let N = −P = {x ∈R:
−x ∈P} denote the negative numbers. Then (x) and
(xi) simply say that R = P ∪{0} ∪N, and these three sets are disjoint. We deﬁne
x < y to mean y −x ∈P. Thus P = {x ∈R: 0 < x}. The usual rules for handling
inequalities follow.
Theorem 1.10. Let x, y, z ∈R. If x < y and y < z then x < z.
Theorem 1.11. Let x, y, z ∈R. If x < y and 0 < z then xz < yz.
We will also use x > y to mean y < x.
Theorem 1.12.
0 < 1
(1.18)
Theorem 1.13. Let x, y, z ∈R, then
(i) If x < y then x + z < y + z.
(ii) If x > 0 then x−1 > 0.
(iii) If x, y > 0 and x < y then y−1 < x−1.
We also deﬁne x 6 y to mean that either x < y or x = y.
Theorem 1.14. If x 6 y and y 6 x then x = y.

4. THE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM
11
Theorem 1.15. Suppose that x, y ∈R and x < y, then there is z ∈R such
that x < z < y.
Note that since we will only use the axioms for an ordered ﬁeld, this holds also
in the rational numbers Q.
Definition 1.3. Let S ⊂R. We say that S is bounded above if there exists a
number b ∈R such that x 6 b for all x ∈S. The number b is then called an upper
bound for S. A number c is called a least upper bound for S if it has the following
two properties:
(i) c is an upper bound for S;
(ii) if b is an upper bound for S, then c 6 b.
Theorem 1.16. If a least upper bound for S exists then it is unique, i.e., if c1
and c2 are both least upper bounds for S then c1 = c2.
Thus we can speak of the least upper bound of a set S.
Definition 1.4. A set S is bounded below if there exists a number b ∈R such
that b 6 x for all x ∈S. The number b is then called a lower bound for S. A
number c is called a greatest lower bound for S if it has the following properties:
(i) c is a lower bound for S;
(ii) if b is a lower bound for S, then b 6 c.
Theorem 1.17. S is bounded above iﬀ−S = {x ∈R:
−x ∈S} is bounded
below.
Theorem 1.18. c is the least upper bound of S iﬀ−c is the greatest lower
bound of −S.
We now state the Least Upper Bound Axiom.
Axiom 4 (Least Upper Bound Axiom). Let ∅̸= S ⊂R be bounded above.
Then S has a least upper bound.
We list a few consequences of this axiom.
Theorem 1.19. Let ∅̸= S ⊂R be bounded below. Then S has a greatest lower
bound.
Theorem 1.20. Let x ∈R, then there exists an integer n ∈Z such that n > x.
Example 1.6. Let x ∈R satisfy
0 6 x < 1
n,
(1.19)
for all integers n > 0. Then x = 0.
Theorem 1.21. Let y > 0. Then there exists a real number x > 0 such that
x2 = y.
In particular, in contrast with Theorem 1.1, the number 2 has a real square
root.
Theorem 1.22. Show that the set Q of rational numbers is an ordered ﬁeld,
but not a complete ordered ﬁeld.

12
1. INTRODUCTION
Note that if y > 0, and x is a square root of y, then also −x is a square root of
y, since
(−x)2 = (−1)2x2 = y.
(1.20)
Thus, if y > 0 it has exactly one non-negative square root x.
Definition 1.5. Let y > 0, we deﬁne the square root of y to be the non-
negative number x > 0 such that x2 = y, and we denote it by x = √y.
This is somewhat in disagreement with our previous deﬁnition of square roots,
but we will no longer use deﬁnition 1.2, hence no problems should arise from this.
Example 1.7. Let a > 0, and b > 0, then
√
ab = √a
√
b.
Definition 1.6. Let x ∈R. We deﬁne its absolute value |x| by:
|x| =
(
x
if x > 0,
−x
if x < 0.
(1.21)
Theorem 1.23. Let x ∈R, then
√
x2 = |x|.
Theorem 1.24. Let x, y ∈R, then |xy| = |x||y|.
Theorem 1.25. Let x, y ∈R then
|x + y| 6 |x| + |y|.
(1.22)
This last inequality is called the triangle inequality. It is used widely.
Theorem 1.26. Let x, y ∈R then
|x −y| > |x| −|y|.
(1.23)
Theorem 1.27. Let x, y ∈R then
|x −y| >
|x| −|y|
.
(1.24)
Appendix
In this appendix, we sketch the construction of an ordered ﬁeld F which does
not satisfy the Least Upper Bound Axiom, and in which Theorem 1.20 does not
hold.
We will use the set of polynomials with real coeﬃcients:
R[t] =
(
p: R →R: p(t) =
n
X
k=0
aktk; ak ∈R
)
.
(1.25)
Note that a function f : R →R is zero iﬀit assigns zero to all real t ∈R. Thus, a
polynomial is zero iﬀall its coeﬃcients are zero. If p ∈R[t], and p ̸= 0, we call the
coeﬃcient of the highest power of t the leading coeﬃcient.
Let F be the set of rational functions with real coeﬃcients. More precisely, let
F = {p/q: p, q ∈R[t]; q ̸= 0},
(1.26)
A rational function can be written in many ways as the ratio of two polynomials.
However, we can always arrange that all common factors have been canceled, and
that in the denominator q, the leading coeﬃcient is positive. This can be achieved
by multiplying numerator and denominator by (−1) without changing the function

4. THE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM
13
r = p/q. We deﬁne addition and multiplication in F as usual for functions. It is
easy to see that the sum and the product of two functions in F is again in F. It is
also not diﬃcult to check that F is a ﬁeld. We will not carry out all these steps here.
They are, although tedious, quite straightforward. We only note that F contains a
copy of Z, in fact a copy of R, namely the constant functions.
Deﬁne P ⊂F to be the set of non-zero rational functions p/q such that the
leading coeﬃcient of pq is positive. The set P is the set of all non-zero rational
functions which can be written as a ratio p/q where the leading coeﬃcients of both
p and q are positive. Now it is clear that 0 ̸∈P. Also, one can check that all the
axioms for P are satisﬁed. Thus F is an ordered ﬁeld.
However, Theorem 1.20 does not hold in F.
In fact, consider the function
t ∈R[t]. This is the function which assigns to each real number x ∈R the real
number x ∈R. Now, if n ∈Z, then t −n has leading coeﬃcient 1, hence lies in
P. Thus n < t. Since this is true for every n ∈Z, we have found an element t ∈F
which is larger than every integer n.
Ordered ﬁelds in which Theorem 1.20 does not hold are called non-Archimedean
ordered ﬁelds. In such a ﬁeld, there are ‘inﬁnitely large’ elements. We have con-
structed here a non-Archimedean ordered ﬁeld F. In F, the elements t, t2, etc, are
inﬁnitely large. Of course the Least Upper Bound axiom does not holds in F.
Example 1.8. Find a non-empty bounded subset S ⊂F which does not have
a least upper bound?

1. INTRODUCTION

CHAPTER 2
Sequences
1. Limits of Sequences
Definition 2.1. A sequence of real numbers, is a function x: N →R.
When no confusion can arise, we will usually abbreviate this simply as a se-
quence. If x: N →R is a sequence, we write, in keeping with tradition, xn in-
stead of x(n), and we will use the notation {xn}∞
n=1 for the sequence x, where
xn = x(n) ∈R. Note that there is a distinction between the sequence {xn}∞
n=1 and
the subset {xn : n ∈N} ⊂R.
Definition 2.2. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a sequence, and let L ∈R. We say that the
sequence {xn}∞
n=1 converges to L, if for every ε > 0, there is an integer N ∈N such
that for all integers n > N, there holds:
|xn −L| < ε.
(2.1)
Theorem 2.1. Suppose that {xn}∞
n=1 converges to L1, and also converges to
L2. Then L1 = L2.
Thus the number L in Deﬁnition 2.2 is unique, and we may speak of the limit
L of the sequence, if it exists.
Example 2.1. Let c ∈R, and for each n ∈N let xn = c.
Then {xn}∞
n=1
converges to c.
Example 2.2. Let xn = 1/n for each n ∈N. Then {xn}∞
n=1 converges to 0.
Definition 2.3. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a sequence. We say that {xn}∞
n=1 converges
if there is an L ∈R such that {xn}∞
n=1 converges to L. If a sequence does not
converge, we say that it diverges.
Example 2.3. Let xn = (−1)n. Then {xn}∞
n=1 diverges.
Theorem 2.2. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a sequence which converges. Then {xn : n ∈
N} ⊂R is bounded above and below.
In order to compute, we need theorems which allow us to perform simple arith-
metic operations with limits. Let {xn}∞
n=1 and {yn}∞
n=1 be sequences. We deﬁne
their sum as the sequence {xn + yn}∞
n=1, i.e. the function (x + y): N →R which
assigns to each n ∈N the number xn + yn ∈R. Similarly, we deﬁne their product
as the sequence {xnyn}∞
n=1.

2. Cauchy Sequences
Definition 2.7. A sequence {xn}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing if xn 6 xn+1 for each
n ∈N.
Similarly, a sequence {xn}∞
n=1 is non-increasing if xn > xn+1 for each
n ∈N.
Definition 2.8. A sequence {xn}∞
n=1 is bounded above if the set {xn : n ∈N}
is bounded above. A sequence {xn}∞
n=1 is bounded below if the set {xn : n ∈N} is
bounded below. A sequence is bounded if it is bounded above and bounded below.
Theorem 2.16. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be an non-decreasing sequence which is bounded
above. Let L ∈R be the least upper bound of the set {xn : n ∈N}. Then {xn}∞
n=1
converges to L.
Theorem 2.17. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a non-increasing sequence which is bounded
below. Let L ∈R be the greatest lower bound of {xn : n ∈N}. Then {xn}∞
n=1
converges to L.
Definition 2.9. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a sequence. We say that {xn}∞
n=1 is a Cauchy
sequence if the following holds:
For each ε > 0, there is N ∈N, such that for all integers n, m > N,
it holds |xn −xm| < ε.
Theorem 2.18. Suppose that {xn}∞
n=1 converges to L.
Then {xn}∞
n=1 is a
Cauchy sequence.
The natural question is then: Does every Cauchy sequence converge? The rest
of this section is devoted to the proof of this fact.
Theorem 2.19. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a Cauchy sequence, and let {xnj}∞
j=1 be a
subsequence of {xn}∞
n=1. Suppose that {xnj}∞
j=1 converges to L. Then {xn}∞
n=1
converges to L.
Theorem 2.20. Let {xn}∞
n=1 be a Cauchy sequence. Then {xn}∞
n=1 is bounded.
Let S ⊂R be bounded above. We will denote its least upper bound by sup S.
Let S be bounded below. We will denote its greatest lower bound by inf S. Note
that if S ⊂R is bounded above, and S′ ⊂S, then S′ is also bounded above. Thus if
{xn}∞
n=1 is bounded above, then for every n ∈N the sets {xk : k > n} are bounded
above.
Theorem 2.21. Suppose ∅̸= T ⊂S ⊂R. Then:
sup T 6 sup S
(2.13)
inf T > inf S.

Theorem 2.22. Suppose {xn}∞

yn = sup{xk : k > n}.

Definition 2.10. The limit of the sequence {yn}∞
n=1 deﬁned in Theorem 2.22
is called the limit superior of {xn}∞
n=1 and is denoted lim supn→∞xn.
Thus, if {xn}∞

Definition 2.11. The limit of the sequence {yn}∞
n=1 deﬁned in Theorem 2.23
is called the limit inferior of {xn}∞
n=1 and is denoted lim infn→∞xn.
Thus, the limit inferior of a bounded sequence {xn}∞
n=1 is:
lim inf
n→∞xn = lim
n→∞(inf{xk : k > n}) .

(3.1)
This is reminiscent of axiomatic geometry where points and lines are not deﬁned,
only the relationship between them is deﬁned. Here instead, we will deﬁne the
terms the series converges, the series diverges, the sum of the series. Of course,
one would like to think of (3.1) as an inﬁnite sum. However, not every series has
a sum, and at this point it is recommended that you try to forget everything you
know about series.

for m ∈N. We say that the series (3.1) converges if the sequence of partial sums

m=1 converges. In this case, we deﬁne the sum of the series as the limit of the
sequence {sm}∞
m=1, and we write:

(3.8)
If the series (3.1) does not converge, we say that it diverges. Similarly, if m ∈Z,
and x: Nm →R, then we deﬁne the partial sums of the series P∞

and deﬁne its sum by:

Functions and Continuity
1. Open and Closed Sets of R
Definition 4.1. Let D ⊂R, and a ∈R. We say that a is a limit point of
D if there exists a sequence {xn}∞
n=1 such that xn ∈D for every n ∈N, and
limn→∞xn = a. The set of all limit points of D is denoted D.
Example 4.1. Let D ⊂R, then D ⊂D. However, it may be that D ̸= D.
Definition 4.2. A set D ⊂R is closed if D = D. A set D ⊂R is open if R\D
is closed.
Theorem 4.1. Let D ⊂R. Then D is closed.
Definition 4.3. Let a < b, I = {x ∈R: a < x < b}, and J = {x ∈R: a 6
x 6 b}. I is called an open interval, and is denoted (a, b). J is called a closed
interval, and is denoted [a, b].
Theorem 4.2. Let D ⊂R. Then D is open if and only if the following state-
ment holds: for every x ∈D, there exists an ε > 0 such that (x −ε, x + ε) ⊂D.
Example 4.2. Every open interval is open. Every closed interval is closed.
Example 4.3. A set may be neither open nor closed.
Theorem 4.3. If a set D ⊂R is both open and closed, then either D = R or
D = ∅.
Definition 4.4. Let D ⊂R. We deﬁne the boundary of D by
∂D = D ∩(R \ D).
(4.1)
Let D ⊂R. We deﬁne the interior of D by:
int D = D \ ∂D.
(4.2)
Theorem 4.4. Let D ⊂R, then x ∈int D if and only if there is ε > 0 such
that (x −ε, x + ε) ⊂D.
Theorem 4.5. Let D ⊂R, then D is open if and only if D = int D.
Definition 4.5. Let D ⊂R. A set U ⊂D is relatively open in D, if there
exists an open set V ⊂R such that V ∩D = U.
Example 4.4. A subset U ⊂D may be relatively open in D but not open.
However, if D is open and U is relatively open in D, then U is open.
Let {Uα : α ∈A} be a family of sets. The set A is the index set, and it can
be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. If A = N for instance, we have a sequence of sets, but we may

want to consider even more general situations. We deﬁne the union S
α∈A Uα to be
the set of all elements x which belong to at least one Uα. Thus, x ∈S
α∈A Uα iﬀ
∃α ∈A such that x ∈Uα. Similarly, we deﬁne the intersection T
α∈A Uα to be the
set of all elements x which belong to all the Uα. Thus, x ∈T
α∈A Uα iﬀ∀α ∈A we
have x ∈Uα.
Theorem 4.6. Let {Uj : 0 6 j 6 n} be a ﬁnite family of open subsets of R.
Then Tn
j=0 Uj is open.
Example 4.5. The intersection of a collection of open sets may not be open.
Theorem 4.7. Let {Uα : α ∈A} be a family of open subsets of R.
Then
S
α∈A Uα is open.
Theorem 4.8. The union of a ﬁnite number of closed sets is closed. The in-
tersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed.
Definition 4.6. A set K ⊂R is compact if every sequence in K has a subse-
quence which converges to an element of K.
Theorem 4.9. Let K ⊂R be compact. Then K is closed and bounded.
Theorem 4.10. Let K ⊂R be closed and bounded. Then K is compact.
2. Limit and Continuity
Definition 4.7. Let D ⊂R, f : D →R, a ∈D, and L ∈R. We say that L is
the limit of f at a if the following condition holds:
If xn ∈D, and lim
n→∞xn = a, then lim
n→∞f(xn) = L.
Remark. In other words, we require that for any sequence {xn}∞
n=1 of elements
in D which converges to a, the sequence {f(xn)}∞
n=0 converges to L. When L is
the limit of the function f at a, we write
lim
x→a f(x) = L.
(4.3)
Theorem 4.11. Let D ⊂R, f : D →R, a ∈D, and L, M ∈R. Suppose that
both limx→a f(x) = L, and limx→a f(x) = M. Then L = M.
Hence, if f : D →R has a limit at a ∈D, then that limit is unique. Thus, we
may speak of the limit of the function f at a. Next, we give an equivalent condition
for L to be the limit of f at a.

f = sup f(D).
(4.14)
The function f is said to be bounded below if f(D) is bounded below. For such a
function, we will write:

D f = inf f(D).
(4.15)
It is said to be bounded if it is bounded above and below.
Example 4.10. There is a function f : D →R bounded above for which there

n=1 on D is a map
from N into the set of functions RD = {f : D →R}. If for each n ∈N the function
fn is continuous on D, we say that {fn}∞
n=1 is a sequence of continuous functions
on D. Let {fn}∞
n=1 be a sequence of functions on D, and let f : D →R. We say
that {fn}∞
n=1 converges to f if for each x ∈D the sequence of numbers {fn(x)}∞
n=1

n=1 be a sequence of functions deﬁned on D. As with
numerical series, we deﬁne the sequence of partial sums of the series P∞
n=1 fn by
sm = Pm
n=1 fn, and we say that the series P∞
n=1 fn converges if the sequence of
partial sums {sm}∞
m=1 converges.

Integration and Diﬀerentiation
1. The Lower and Upper Intergals
We will use the notation {xj}n
j=0 for a ﬁnite sequence, i.e., a function x: N n
0 →
R, where n is some positive integer, and N n
0 = {j ∈Z: 0 6 j 6 n}. As before, a
ﬁnite sequence {xj}n
j=0 is increasing if xj−1 < xj for all 1 6 j 6 n.
Definition 5.1. Let n ∈N. An increasing ﬁnite sequence P = {xj}n
j=0 with
x0 = a, and xn = b is called a partition of [a, b]. We denote the set of all partitions
of [a, b] by P[a, b]. If P = {xj}n
j=1 ∈P[a, b], we deﬁne ∆j(P) = xj −xj−1. If
P1, P2 ∈P[a, b], we say that P1 is a reﬁnement of P2, written P1 ⊃P2, if the image
of P2 as a function is contained in the image of P1.
Theorem 5.1. Let P1, P2 ∈P[a, b]. Then there is P ∈P[a, b] such that P ⊃P1,
and P ⊃P2.
A partition P satisfying P ⊃P1, and P ⊃P2, as given by this theorem, is
called a common reﬁnement of P1 and P2.
Definition 5.2. Let f be a bounded function deﬁned on [a, b], and let P ∈
P[a, b]. We deﬁne for each 1 6 j 6 n:

We deﬁne the lower integral and the upper integral of f over [a, b] by:

satisfy P1 ⊃P2. Then, L(f, P2) 6 L(f, P1), and U(f, P1) 6 U(f, P2).
Theorem 5.4. Let f be a bounded function on [a, b], and let P1, P2 ∈P[a, b],
then L(f, P1) 6 U(f, P2).

Definition 5.4. A function f : D →R is non-decreasing on D if for every
x, y ∈D such that x 6 y, there holds f(x) 6 f(y). We say that f is non-increasing
on D is −f is non-decreasing. A function f : D →R is monotonic if f is either
non-decreasing or non-increasing on [a, b].

fa : D \ {a} →R by:
fa(x) = f(x) −f(a)
x −a
.
(5.1)
If the function fa has the limit m at a, we say that m is the derivative of f at a,
and write:
f ′(a) = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
.
(5.2)
If f has a derivative at a, we say that f is diﬀerentiable at a. If D is open, and f
is diﬀerentiable at each a ∈D, then we say that f is diﬀerentiable on D.
Theorem 5.19. Let f : D →R be diﬀerentiable at a ∈int D. Then f is con-
tinuous at a.
Theorem 5.20. Let f : D →R be diﬀerentiable at a ∈int D, and let c ∈R.
