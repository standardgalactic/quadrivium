__str__ vs __repr__
à both used for creating a string representation of an object
à typically __repr__ is used by developers
à try to make it so that the string could be used to recreated the object
à otherwise make it as descriptive as possible
à useful for debugging
à __str__ is used by str() and print() functions, as well as various formatting functions
à typically used for display purposes to end user, logging, etc
à if __str__ is not implemented, Python will look for __repr__ instead
à called when using the repr() function
à if neither is implemented and since all objects inherit from 
Object, will use __repr__ defined there instead
à we'll come back to this after we discuss inheritance
