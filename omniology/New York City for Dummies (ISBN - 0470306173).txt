Introduction
W
hen it comes to a city as famous and infamous as New York is,
everybody has an opinion, often based on indelible film images
or evocative song lyrics. Growing up in other places, my New York was a
city of artists and warriors, where all the critics loved you and you could
dance, if you wanted to, in legwarmers on top of a city taxicab. The New
York I made my home as an adult is tamer and wealthier but still full of
hassles and hustles. It is also a place where the only thing you can count
on is change. New Yorkers like the shock of the new — it’s where the city
gets its fabled energy. We have short attention spans here on the bleed-
ing edge; a restaurant, show, club, or store may be the hottest thing to
hit the city for a couple of months, and then another opens or is discov-
ered, and that once-hot place quickly becomes yesterday’s news.
On the other hand, New Yorkers don’t always appreciate change
because it means we may have lost something we had come to love. New
Yorkers respect the old standards — places and things that have
become a part of the city’s core identity. What would we do without that
reassuring sight of the Lady in the harbor? Or the gleaming spire of the
Empire State Building? Or the perfect pizza slice? Or a Sunday in Central
Park? Or the rumbling of the trains beneath our feet? Or the sounds of
jazz from a Village club? So even though New York is ever-changing —
since the beginning of the decade we’ve bid adieu to the Twin Towers,
the subway token, and Yankee and Shea stadiums — certain essential
features remain the same. And we wouldn’t have it any other way.
In the pages that follow, I do my best to guide you to what’s fresh and
new, without leaving out the old standards. I tell you where to find the
best New York has to offer, both on and off the beaten path. But really,
what I hope to accomplish is to present New York as simply as possible
so that you can decide what path you want to be on during your visit.
About This Book
Maybe this is your first trip to New York, or maybe you’re a repeat visi-
tor; in either case, I assume that you want to find out what you need to
know plus a little bit more. But I don’t want to overload you with infor-
mation, which is easy to do when you’re talking about New York.
This book is both a guidebook and a reference book. You can read it
cover to cover, or you can jump in anywhere to find the information you
want about a specific task, such as finding a hotel or working out your

budget. Whether you’re sitting in your living room trying to make a
reservation or standing on the corner of 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue
wondering where to eat, New York City For Dummies, 5th Edition, is set
up so that you can get the facts, analysis, and recommendations you
want, quickly.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — this is especially true of prices. I, therefore, suggest that you
write or call ahead to confirm prices and details when making your
travel plans. The author, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsi-
ble for readers’ experiences while traveling. Your safety is important to
us, however, so I encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As I
describe each, I often include abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I’ve divided the hotels into two categories: my personal picks of the top
accommodations the city has to offer and those that don’t quite make
my preferred list but still get my hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy
about considering these “runner-up” hotels if you’re unable to get a
room at one of my favorites or if your preferences differ from mine —
the amenities offered by the runners-up and the services that each 
provides make all these accommodations good choices to consider as
you determine where to rest your head at night.
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I’ve used
a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel
(the price refers to a double-occupancy room) or a meal at a restaurant
(included in the cost of each meal is soup or salad, an entree, dessert,
and a nonalcoholic drink). Check out the following table to decipher the
dollar signs:

For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside of Manhattan, it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You’re an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore New York and wants expert advice when you finally do get
a chance to enjoy the city.
 You’re an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when deter-
mining whether to take a trip to New York and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about New York or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best or most unique experience
in New York.
If you fit any of these criteria, then New York City For Dummies, 5th edi-
tion gives you the information you’re looking for.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts covering the major aspects of your
trip. Each part is further broken down into specific components so that
you can go right to the subtopic you want (you don’t have to read all
about nightlife if you’re just looking for a jazz club, for example).
Following are brief summaries of the parts.
Part I: Introducing New York City
In this part, I give you my opinion on the very best of New York when it
comes to hotels, attractions, events, and restaurants. This part also
includes some basic information on culture, history, architecture, and
food, along with the differences the seasons make in determining when
you may want to visit and a yearly calendar of major events.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City
This part covers the nitty-gritty of trip planning: how to manage your
money and plan your budget for your visit; how to get to New York;
whether you should join an escorted tour or choose a package tour;
what to do if you have special needs; and other nuts ’n’ bolts details.
Part III: Settling Into New York City
This part is all about getting around, from the moment your plane lands
or you step off the train or bus. I cover ground transportation into
Manhattan, the public-transit system, and sights to see on foot. This part
also includes information about many New York neighborhoods and
what makes them distinct. From there, I give an overview of the New
York lodging scene and how to find the best room rate, and then I list my
favorite hotels along with a few very good runners-up. Finally, this part
includes a chapter on eating in New York. Here, I give you an idea of the
food scene in New York, along with yummy snacking options like pizza,
bagels, and desserts.
Part IV: Exploring New York City
This part describes what to see and do, from touring famous buildings
to attending a TV show taping. This part also includes a chapter on
shopping the local stores. Here, I point out the best shopping neighbor-
hoods and the city’s best stores. To help you fit in all that you want to
see while you’re here, I also provide some sample itineraries to help you
organize your time in the city.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: 
New York City Nightlife
This part covers New York’s major arts attractions, from Broadway
shows to clubs, and gives you an idea of what each activity costs and
how to get discount tickets. I also include a chapter on nightclubs, places
to have a drink, and other more or less civilized forms of relaxation.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens gives you a few of my top tens of New York. You can
take them seriously. Or you can take them for what they are — fun.
Either way, I think you will enjoy them.
Quick Concierge
In the back of this book, I include an appendix — your Quick Concierge —
containing lots of handy information you may need when traveling in New
York, like phone numbers and addresses for emergency personnel or area
hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspapers and magazines, proto-
col for sending mail or finding taxis, and more. Check out this appendix
New York City For Dummies, 5th Edition 
4

when searching for answers to lots of questions that may come up as you
travel. You can find the Quick Concierge easily because it’s printed on
yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
Keep your eyes peeled for icons, which appear in the margins through-
out the book. These little pictures serve as a kind of shorthand or code
to alert you to special information. Here’s the decryption key:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best that New York has to offer
in all categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping,
and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations, such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware of.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
Secret little finds or useful resources that are worth the extra bit of
effort to get to or find are highlighted by the Worth the Search icon.
Where to Go from Here
New York can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. It can seem
budget-busting, but it doesn’t have to be. In New York, you can find
something for everyone — and that’s what makes it so special. This
book, and all it offers, helps assuage any fears or apprehensions you
may have as it guides you to a fun, stress-free trip to the Big Apple.

Part I
Introducing
New York City

In this part . . .
I
give you a taste of the best of New York City, with a spot-
light on the top restaurants, hotels, attractions, sights, and
sounds that make up this unique city. I do my best to guide
you to what’s hot and new, as well as to the classics. I tell you
where to ﬁnd the best New York has to offer and steer you to
places both on and off the beaten track.
In this part, I also give you a brief history of New York City, as
well as overviews of the architecture and cuisine, and I ﬁnish
up with some books and ﬁlms you may enjoy as you get ready
to hit the town.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of New York City
In This Chapter
 Celebrating the most festive parades and seasons
 Finding rooms in the best hotels
 Enjoying all kinds of cuisine at all kinds of restaurants
 Visiting Lady Liberty and other top attractions
 Giving the credit card a workout at the top shops
 Choosing the spots with the best nightlife
W
elcome to New York, New York, the city so nice they had to name
it — oh, you know. No matter when you visit, there’s sure to be
something of interest going on. In this chapter, I list my choices for the
best events, hotels, restaurants, attractions, shopping, culture, and
nightlife.
Whether you’re looking for a world-class hotel, exotic cuisine to enjoy,
or the view from the Empire State Building, I have no doubt you’ll soon
compile your own “Best of” list. But here’s a good place to start!
Best Events
Best Parade: West Indian–American Day Carnival and Parade. Held on
Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, this is the biggest parade in New York. The
music (calypso, soca, reggae, and Latin), the amazing costumes, and the
incredible Caribbean food make this an unforgettable experience. If you’re
lucky enough to be in town on Labor Day, don’t miss it. See Chapter 3.
Best Time of Year to Come to New York: Late spring. Many people
adore summer, when free outdoor cultural events abound, and I agree
that it’s a fun time to visit. But late spring is even better: New Yorkers
are ecstatically trading their winter coats for summer dresses and
shorts the minute that temperatures are consistently in the 60s, the
city’s in bloom, prices are still reasonable, and there’s a lovely sense of
anticipation and sociability in the air.

As Little Italy has shrunk, Chinatown
has grown. Canal Street is mobbed daily
with seafood, fruit and vegetable, and 
DVD, CD, and sunglass vendors compet-
ing for very little sidewalk space.  Get 
lost in the maze of side streets for a 
more interesting stroll.   
Narrow streets are lined with skyscrapers 
here and during the week the activity is 
relentless. You’ll also find some of the 
city’s oldest and most historic structures 
here. At night and on weekends the 
area, however, is eerily desolate.

The once-famous bohemian enclave where off-beat
became the Beats is still the city’s best people-
watching neighborhood. You won’t find any high-
rises here, just quaint, narrow streets and beautifully
preserved brownstones and townhouses.
I’m not sure why this very tiny stretch of furniture
stores, boutiques, and a few restaurants
has been designated a neighborhood, but it has.
Maybe the powers that decide these things
wanted a companion to SoHo so they came up
with NoHo (North of Houston Street).
The East Village now is home to some of the city’s
most interesting restaurants and despite its counter-
culture reputation, real estate prices are very
“establishment.”
Here’s another neighborhood that has a cute
acronym (North of Little Italy). This is really old Little
Italy in architecture, but there is nothing old about
the very hip boutiques and cafes that are sprinkled
throughout the relatively small enclave.
What once was an artist’s destination has become 
a very affluent tourist destination. You’ll find just
about all the top designer names in retail here 
housed in historic cast-iron buildings.
This is where so many immigrants, especially Jewish,
settled as their first home in America. And there is
still some of that old world feel to the neighborhood
but it is fading fast as it has become a city’s hot
spot for restaurants, bars, and clubs.
In the 1980s TriBeCa (Triangle Below Canal), with its
sprawling lofts and hip restaurants, became one of
the most desirable places to live. After September 11, 
2001 and its close proximity to the World Trade
Center, the area lost a bit of its luster, but that was
only temporary. TriBeCa is thriving once again.
Sadly, this once unique and charming neighborhood,
squeezed by the expansion of Chinatown, has shrunk
to a mere block or two. And what’s left, with very
few exceptions, is nothing like what it once was. You
can’t even get a good plate of pasta here anymore.

The heart of corporate Manhattan, 
Midtown East is also where you’ll find such
landmarks as Grand Central Station, the
Empire State Building, St. Patrick’s
Cathedral, the Chrysler Building, and the
United Nations.
This bustling sprawl of an area includes
many of the city’s best hotels, the Art Deco
masterpiece, Rockefeller Center, and a
neighborhood called Hell’s Kitchen where
you’ll find some of the city’s most ethnically
diverse restaurants.
In the truly American tradition, everything
here is big and gaudy and, as a result, the
streets here are constantly crammed with
people who have come to gawk at the big
and the gaudy — meaning the neon
wonderland of Times Square. 
This is a quiet, mostly residential neighbor-
hood. On its southern fringe is the Indo-
Pakistani enclave known as Curry Hill.
The heart of this neighborhood is the 
postcard-perfect little park that’s so 
exclusive you need a key to get into it. 
You don’t need a special key to live in the 
quaint and very beautiful brownstones 
that surround the park, but you do need 
money. Many of the buildings here date
back to the 1800s, giving the area a real
19th century feel. 
Cheaper rents attracted many publishing
and media businesses and, as a result, the
neighborhood is now bursting with
restaurants and clubs. Along with Union
Square, and the wildly popular greenmarket,
the Flatiron Building embodies the spirit of
this vibrant neighborhood.
With galleries everywhere, Chelsea is now 
one of the city’s arts centers. There is an
almost small town feel to this neighborhood,
which has also become the center for the 
city’s gay population.

This 843-acre nature retreat in the heart
of Manhattan is one of the great parks
of the world. Even if nature is not your 
thing, from the Central Park Zoo to the
Carousel, from playgrounds to skating
rinks, there is something for everyone in
Central Park.
This mostly residential neighborhood also
features landmarks like Lincoln Center,
the Museum of Natural History, and the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine and is
enviable because it is surrounded by two
great parks, Central Park and Riverside
Park.
Long the address of the rich and famous,
the Upper East Side is also the home to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Guggenheim, and other fantastic
museums along “Museum Mile.” You’ll
also find a thick concentration of
restaurants and bars, and, of course,
some great and very expensive shopping 
along tony Madison Avenue.

Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of New York City 15

Best Season in New York: The December holidays. Lighted Christmas
trees on Park Avenue; the big snowflake at the corner of 57th Street and
Fifth Avenue; the trees at Rockefeller Center and Lincoln Center; the
Hanukkah menorah at Grand Army Plaza at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street;
the decorations in department store windows, restaurants, and hotels.
And even though the crowds, especially around Rockefeller Center,
might bring out the Scrooge in you, the atmosphere is almost always 
festive and like no other time of year.
Best Hotels
For more information on all the hotels listed in this section, refer to
Chapter 9.
Best Hotel: The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park. The combination
of a great location, just across from Central Park; large, well-outfitted
rooms; and typically excellent Ritz-Carlton service is as good as it gets.
Best Hotel for Modern New York Elegance: The Mercer. The best of the
hip, downtown hotels, the Mercer is located in the heart of SoHo. The
high-ceilinged, loftlike rooms and suites, some with fireplaces and all
with ceiling fans and luxurious bathrooms, are spectacular.
Best for Classic Old-World Elegance: Hôtel Plaza Athénée. That
European feel pervades the hotel from the old-world design to the first-
rate concierge service.
Best Trendy Hotel: The Hotel on Rivington. The first major hotel on the
trendy Lower East Side is a glass marvel with floor-to-ceiling windows,
views galore, and massive soaking tubs.
Best Times Square Hotel: Hotel QT. Hotel QT is a good bet for its mod-
erate prices and location, but it’s hard to beat the swimming pool — in
the lobby — with a swim-up bar.
Best Moderately Priced Hotel: The Lucerne. This is the best hotel on
the Upper West Side. The homey, neighborhood feel of the hotel com-
bined with exceptional service and nice-size, well-equipped rooms make
this a very attractive midrange option.
Best Budget Hotel: Chelsea Lodge. If you don’t mind sharing a toilet
with other guests, this charming hotel offers impeccable comforts —
including an actual sink and shower — at a budget price.
Best for Families: Hotel Beacon. Not only is this hotel a great deal —
you can get good-sized suites for so much less than you would pay in
Midtown — but the Upper West Side, with its parks, the Museum of
Natural History, and fun restaurants, is also a great neighborhood for
children.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
16

Best Romantic Hotel: Sofitel New York. How can an almost 400-room
hotel be romantic? Maybe it’s because the hotel is French-owned and
staying here feels like you’ve escaped for a naughty tryst in Paris.
Best Hotel Bar: Bemelmans Bar. Named after book illustrator Ludwig
Bemelmans, who created the Madeline books and painted the mural in
the bar, the Carlyle Hotel’s romantic, charming bar features white-glove
service and wondrous cocktails.
Best Restaurants
For more information on the restaurants listed in this section, head to
Chapter 10.
Best Restaurant: Gramercy Tavern. This New York favorite has been
reinvigorated by executive chef Michael Anthony, who creates sophisti-
cated American cuisine that is both refined and deeply satisfying.
Best Special-Occasion Restaurant: Chanterelle. If you want to impress
that special loved one, you won’t go wrong if you choose Chanterelle.
The food is consistently superb, the room lovely and intimate, and the
service impeccable.
Best for Romance: Café des Artistes. If the murals of the naked wood
nymphs don’t get you in the mood, the old-school French cooking cou-
pled with traditional, white-glove service just might.
Best Chinese: Great N.Y. Noodletown. With all the culinary wonders
that Chinatown has to offer, this is a tough choice. Noodletown’s a
winner, where the soups are always fresh and comforting and anything
that’s salt-baked is guaranteed to be sublime.
Best French: Daniel. For faultless French cooking, nobody does it better
than Chef Daniel Boulud, especially here at his signature restaurant.
Best Italian: Lupa. How can you choose just one great Italian restaurant
in the city? Impossible . . . but chef Mario Batali continues to deliver
high-quality food at great prices in this Roman-style osteria.
Best Mexican: Pampano. Seafood is what they do best here and that
includes the amazing seviches and the lobster tacos.
Best Seafood: Lure. Not only is the seafood super-fresh and flavorful,
but it’s served in a super-sexy setting, a subterranean re-creation of a
luxury yacht.
Best Steak: Frankie & Johnnie’s. Whether you choose the former speak-
easy that is the original location in the Theater District or the newer
branch in John Barrymore’s former town house, your steak, particularly
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of New York City 17

the house sirloin, will remind you why Frankie & Johnnie’s has been
around since 1926.
Best Jewish Deli: 2nd Avenue Deli. The deli’s no longer on Second
Avenue, but the pastrami sandwiches and chicken soup are as good as
ever. And now you get free chicken cracklins (gribenes) with your meal.
Best Burger: Burger Joint. Who woulda thunk that a fancy hotel like Le
Parker Meridien would be the home to a place called Burger Joint that
serves great burgers at great prices?
Best Pizza: Grimaldi’s Pizza. No matter which one I choose, I’m going to
receive letters of disagreement. But I’m a Grimaldi’s girl; it’s the super-
light crust that does it.
Best Breakfast: Good Enough to Eat. They’ve been lining up on
Amsterdam Avenue on weekend mornings for over 20 years to get a
taste of chef/owner Carrie Levin’s bountiful home-cooked breakfasts.
Best Dessert: Haveli. I’ve got an incorrigible sweet tooth, so I can find
something to love on any dessert menu. But the one I most look forward
to is Haveli’s gulab jaman, always served hot and just this side of impos-
sibly sweet. It’s a pure sugar rush to heaven.
Best Ice Cream: Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory. A treat from the Ice
Cream Factory is the perfect reward after a brisk walk across the
Brooklyn Bridge. Rich homemade ice cream with a view of the
Manhattan skyline — that’s a tough combination to beat.
Best Bagel: Ess-a-Bagel. Big and fluffy, with a thick schmear of cream
cheese — the best in its class.
Best Times Square Restaurant: Virgil’s Real Barbecue. In a restaurant
wasteland loaded with bad theme restaurants or overpriced national
chains, Virgil’s, in a sense, is a barbecue-theme restaurant, but it does an
excellent job of smoking meats.
Best Attractions
For more information on the attractions in this section, refer to 
Chapter 11.
Best Attraction: Statue of Liberty. If you have time to do only one thing
on your visit to New York, sail to the Lady in the harbor. No other monu-
ment embodies the nation’s, and the world’s, notion of political freedom
and economic potential more than Lady Liberty. It is also the ultimate
symbol of New York, the personification of the city’s vast diversity and
tolerance.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
18

Best Skyscraper: Empire State Building. Like the Statue of Liberty, the
Empire State Building, once again the tallest building in New York, is one
of the city’s definitive icons. The view from the 86th-floor observatory is
unforgettable.
Best-Looking Building: Chrysler Building. This award goes to this
chrome-topped, gargoyle-laden Art Deco masterpiece. It’s my personal
beacon on the skyline.
Best Historic Building: Grand Central Terminal. Even if you don’t have
to catch a train, make sure you visit this Beaux Arts gem that was built
in 1913, saved from destruction in the 1960s, and beautifully restored in
the 1990s to recapture its initial brilliance.
Best Art Museum: Metropolitan Museum of Art. It’s not only the best
art museum in New York, but the best in North America as well. The
number of masterworks housed here is mind-boggling.
Best Museum for Children (Big and Small): American Museum of
Natural History. You could spend your entire visit to New York at this 
4-square-block museum; there’s that much to see. From the famed
Dinosaur Hall to the adjoining Rose Center for Earth and Space, the
Museum of Natural History houses the world’s greatest natural-science
collection.
Best Park: Central Park. It’s one of the world’s greatest urban refuges,
serving as a center of calm and tranquillity amid the noise and bustle of
Manhattan.
Best Location in Central Park for a Picnic: The Pool. At 100th Street,
the Pool is like being in another world. It’s relatively quiet and undiscov-
ered, and with weeping willows, ducks, geese, egrets, and a hawk or two,
this watering hole is an oasis of tranquillity.
Best Place to Take the Kids: Central Park. Again, head to Central Park.
With a lovely carousel, a zoo, two ice-skating rinks, and numerous play-
grounds and ball fields, Central Park is a children’s wonderland.
Best Street: Broadway. Fifth Avenue has the better reputation, but it’s
lost some luster in the past few years with the proliferation of chain and
theme stores, so my pick is Broadway. As it stretches from one end of
Manhattan to the other, no street captures the city’s diversity better
than Broadway.
Best Neighborhood to Stroll: Greenwich Village. With its historic
streets, hidden cafes, cozy restaurants, and eccentric characters,
Greenwich Village is a constant, but pleasant, barrage on the senses.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of New York City 19

Best Bridge: Brooklyn Bridge. New York is a city of bridges connecting
the various islands to the mainland and beyond. But none equals the
splendor and originality of the Brooklyn Bridge. Walking across it is a
must.
Best Free Attraction: Staten Island Ferry. With views of the Statue of
Liberty, Ellis Island, lower Manhattan, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge,
and the rest of New York Harbor — and the chance to mingle with 
commuters — you can’t beat the price of this ride.
Best Shopping
For more information on the stores in this section, skip to Chapter 12.
Best Store: Saks Fifth Avenue. Not as overwhelming as other depart-
ment stores, Saks is consistently good. Don’t miss the windows at
Christmas!
Best Clothes Store: Barneys. This store is the pinnacle with prices to
match.
Best Bookstore: McNally Jackson. In a city of many terrific bookstores,
McNally Jackson has distinguished itself with a lovingly curated selec-
tion of general-interest literature and a comprehensive roster of special
events.
Best Music Store: Other Music. Come to Other Music to make unex-
pected discoveries and to broaden your horizons.
Best Shopping Zone: SoHo, NoHo, and Nolita. All three are within easy
walking distance of one another and feature the best, trendiest boutiques.
Best Culture and Nightlife
For more information on the listings in this section, jump to Chapters 14
and 15.
Best Performance Space: Carnegie Hall. You can find few greater per-
formance spaces in the world than this one. Visually and acoustically
brilliant, Carnegie Hall regularly attracts an amazing array of talent.
Best Free Cultural Event: Shakespeare in the Park. Imagine
Shakespeare performed by stars, under the stars, in Central Park. No
wonder it has become a New York institution.
Best Children’s Theater: Paper Bag Players. For children ages 4 to 9,
this group performs in the winter only and offers tales told in imagina-
tive and original ways.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
20

Best Jazz Club: Village Vanguard. The acoustics and sightlines aren’t
great, but you can’t do better for finding consistent, good-quality jazz.
Best Rock Club: Mercury Lounge. This venue is intimate, but not
obscure. The Merc is the best for hard-edge rock ’n’ roll.
Best Comedy Club: Gotham Comedy Club. Comfortable and sophisti-
cated, this is where the best come to hone their acts.
Best Pub: Ear Inn. Located in an old hanger-on in chic SoHo, I hope it
continues to survive among the lush lounges that surround it.
Best Bar with a View: Rise Bar, in the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park Hotel.
With views of Lady Liberty, New York Harbor, and incredible sunsets,
this bar is worth seeking out even if you’re not staying at the hotel.
Best Bar for Cocktails: Pegu Club. Owned by master mixologist Audrey
Saunders, the creative cocktails — whether shaken, stirred, or poured —
are always perfect.

o matter how much you know (or don’t know) about New York, it
may help you to get a little background on the city before you
arrive. Here’s a quick overview — historical timelines, architectural
highlights, culinary tidbits, a recommended reading and films list — that
may help you discover a part of what makes New York unique.
Hunting Down a Little History
The area that became New York City was the home to many Native
Americans before Giovanni da Verrazano arrived in 1524. Even though
Verrazano didn’t stay, a bridge was named after him. And it wasn’t until
1609, when Henry Hudson, while searching for the Northwest Passage,
claimed it for the Dutch East India Company, that New York was recog-
nized as a potential, profitable settlement in the New World.
Hudson (the river is named for him) said of New York, “It is as beautiful
a land as one can hope to tread upon.” The treading didn’t really start
until years later, but by 1625, Dutch settlers established a fur trade with
the locals and called their colony New Amsterdam. A year later, Peter
Minuit of the Dutch West India Company made that famous deal for the
island. He bought New Amsterdam from the Lenape Tribe for $24.
New Amsterdam became a British colony in the 1670s, and during the
Revolutionary War it was occupied by British troops. England controlled
New York until 1783 when it withdrew from the city two full years after
the end of the American Revolution. Two years after that, New York was
named the first capital of the United States. The first Congress was held

at Federal Hall on Wall Street in 1789, and George Washington was inau-
gurated president. But New York’s tenure as the capital didn’t last long.
A year later, the government headed south to the newly created District
of Columbia.
By 1825, New York City’s population swelled to 250,000, and it rose to a
half-million by mid-century. The city was a hotbed of Union recruitment
during the Civil War; in the 1863 draft riots, Irish immigrants violently
protested the draft and lynched 11 African Americans.
With industry booming, the late 19th century was termed the “Gilded
Age.” New York City was an example of this label in action; millionaires
built mansions on Fifth Avenue, while rows of tenements teeming with
families (made up of the cheap, mostly immigrant laborers who were
employed by the industrial barons) filled the city’s districts. In 1880, the
city’s population boomed to 1.1 million.
More European immigrants poured into the city between 1900 and 1930,
arriving at Ellis Island and then fanning out into neighborhoods like the
Lower East Side, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, and Harlem. With the city
population at 7 million in 1930 and a Depression raging, New York turned
to a feisty mayor named Fiorello La Guardia for help. With the assistance
of civic planner Robert Moses, who masterminded a huge public works
program, the city was remade. Moses did some things well, but his high-
way, bridge, tunnel, and housing projects ran through (and sometimes
destroyed) many vibrant neighborhoods.

While most of the country prospered after World War II, New York, with
those Moses-built highways and a newly forming car culture, endured an
exodus to the suburbs. By 1958, the Dodgers had left Brooklyn and the
Giants had left the Polo Grounds. This economic slide climaxed in 1975
when the city nearly declared bankruptcy (as the famous Daily News
headline said, “Ford to City: Drop Dead”).
As Wall Street rallied during the 1980s, New York’s fortunes also
improved. In the 1990s, with Rudolph Giuliani — whom they haven’t
named anything after (yet) — as the mayor, the city rode a wave of pros-
perity that left it safer, cleaner, and more populated. The flip side of this
boom was that Manhattan became more homogenized. Witness the
Disney-fication of Times Square — the ultimate symbol of New York’s
homogenization — and the yawning gap between the rich and poor.
The city — and the world — was shocked on September 11, 2001, when
terrorists flew planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.
But New York’s grit and verve showed itself once more, as the city began
to rebound emotionally and financially from that terrible tragedy. As this
book goes to press, rebuilding on the site continues.
Looking at Local Architecture
You don’t have to be an architectural scholar to appreciate New York’s
rich architectural heritage. New York has many impressively ornate
buildings, along with a slew of tall, sleek, modern skyscrapers (one of
my lesser-known favorites is the “Lipstick Building” at Third Avenue and
53rd Street). The architectural styles in New York are as diverse as the

Lauding the Local Cuisine
Try to define the local cuisine of New York: Is it a hot dog with mustard?
Pastrami on rye? A bagel and a schmear? A slice (of pizza, of course)?
It’s all of them and more. The cuisine of New York is the cuisine of the
world. A little bit of everything goes into the melting pot, and the mix is
constantly changing. A few years ago, you couldn’t get good Mexican
food; now, the influx of Mexican immigrants has brought good, authentic
Mexican restaurants to town. On the other hand, you now have to cross
the river to New Jersey to find excellent Cuban food, and no number of
transplants from south of the Mason-Dixon line (including me) have
managed to improve the city’s Southern, Creole, or barbecue options.
Even in New York, you can’t have everything.
But what defines New York cuisine is not just different ethnic foods, but
the different trends, styles, and types of restaurants. Food is important
in New York. And it’s also big business. This is a city where a hamburger
can sell from $5 to $50. It’s also the city where you can find a restaurant
where the only item on the menu is hummus. Everyone can find some-
thing to eat in New York. For a list of some of New York’s best restau-
rants in every category, see Chapter 10.
Recommending Books and Movies
New York City has inspired writers for hundreds of years, and film-
makers since the invention of the form. You may gain another level of
understanding of the city by reading or watching some of the following
nonfiction works or films.
New York City on paper
For the definitive history of New York City from its birth to the end of
the 19th century, you won’t find a better read than the Pulitzer Prize–
winning Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898, by Edwin G.
Burrows and Mike Wallace (Oxford University Press).
One of master biographer Robert A. Caro’s early works, The Power
Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York (Vintage), focuses on
how the vision of master builder Robert Moses transformed New York to
what it became in the second half of the 20th century.
In Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn
Bridge (Simon & Schuster), David McCullough devotes his estimable 
talents to the story of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The companion volume to a PBS Series (see New York: A Documentary
Film later in this chapter), New York: An Illustrated History, by Ric
Burns, Lisa Ades, and James Sanders (Knopf), uses lavish photographs
and illustrations to show the growth of New York City.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
26

Luc Sante details New York’s 19th- and early-20th-century criminal under-
belly in his highly regarded Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New
York (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux). A personal favorite, New York Calling,
a collection of essays and photographs edited by Marshall Berman and
Brian Berger (Reaktion Books), provides engrossing firsthand accounts of
life in the city during the rough years of the 1970s and early 1980s.
The great essayist E. B. White’s classic, Here Is New York (Little
Bookroom), is as relevant today as it was in 1948 when it was written.
Another timeless masterpiece is Miroslav Sasek’s illustrated children’s
book from 1960, This Is New York (Universe Books). Both books are
available in recent reprints.
New York City on film
Few places are as cinematic as New York City. Filmmakers sometimes
think of the city as a character itself. These are some of the top New
York City movies, worth viewing before you visit.
Possibly the best New York City promotional film is the musical On The
Town, with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. This film is about three sailors
who spend their 24-hour leave exploring Gotham. Shot on location, all
the landmarks, circa 1949, are captured in Technicolor.
“I love this dirty town,” says Burt Lancaster in the gritty, crackling Sweet
Smell of Success. In this beautifully photographed black-and-white
movie from 1957, Lancaster plays gossip columnist J. J. Hunsecker, and
Tony Curtis is the groveling publicist Sidney Falco.
Despite his recent forays to London, Woody Allen is known as a quintes-
sential New York filmmaker. I’m too big a fan to choose just one to rec-
ommend; among his best looks at neurotic New York are Annie Hall
(1977), Manhattan (1979), and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986).
Another filmmaker identified with New York is Martin Scorsese. He has
made many films in which New York plays a central role, including Mean
Streets (1973), After Hours (1984), and The Age of Innocence (1993).
But the one film where New York is a character, and not a very flattering
one, is Taxi Driver. The 1976 movie about an alienated and psychotic
taxi driver is tough and bloody, but if you want to see images of pre-
cleanup Times Square, check out this film.
Two of the best recent glimpses of New York life beyond glittering
Manhattan are Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing (1989) and Wayne Wang’s
Smoke (1995). These Brooklyn-based award-winning films are driven by
characters who spring from a fabric that could have been woven only in
New York.
The best history of New York on video is the Ric Burns documentary,
New York: A Documentary Film (1999). The 7-disc, 14-hour DVD (also
available on VHS), with a poignant, post-9/11 epilogue, is a must-see for
anyone interested in the evolution of this great city.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Choosing the best time to visit New York City
 Keeping your cool or dressing warmly
 Flipping through the calendar of events
B
ecause New York offers such a wide variety of attractions and
sights, people visit the city year-round, regardless of the weather.
In addition to giving you the lowdown on New York life during each
season, this chapter includes a calendar of events if you’d like to plan
your visit around a particular activity.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Summer or winter, rain or shine, great stuff is always going on in New
York City, so I can’t really tell you a “best” time to go. I can, however,
give you some of the pros and cons, season by season:
 Winter: With the exception of the holiday weeks in December,
winter is a great time to come to New York if you’re searching for
bargains. Hotel rates are at their lowest, tickets to top shows are
attainable, and reservations at the best restaurants are manage-
able. But if your idea of a vacation doesn’t involve walking around
bundled in layers to insulate you from the face-breaking cold, then
don’t come during a New York winter.
 Spring: This is the wettest time of year, but in between the show-
ers, the flowers in the park bloom and the temperatures are more
pedestrian-friendly. As a result, the tourists make their way back to
the city and hotel rates begin to rise, especially in late spring.
 Summer: The city is sticky, streets begin to radiate a pungent
stench, and tempers can be testy. Why, then, would you come to
New York in the summer? Because you’ve got so many free outdoor
events, such as concerts and plays, to choose from. Restaurants
are less crowded, museums and other attractions are more man-
ageable, you can picnic in Central Park, and you can walk around in
summery dresses or shorts and sandals.

 Fall: With mild temperatures and dry days, fall is New York’s best
weather season. But it’s also the busiest time of year in the city.
Everyone is back to school or work; street fairs continue through the
early fall; and reservations at restaurants and hotels are tougher to
snag. You’ll also be hard-pressed to find bargains during this period.
To get an idea of the kind of temperatures and weather you may experi-
ence during a particular month in New York, take a look at Table 3-1.

Part II
Planning Your Trip 
to New York City

In this part . . .
I
suggest ways to get the best value out of your travel budget
and prepare you for how much things cost in New York City
(a lot!). I also discuss your options for getting to New York 
City, whether you’re ﬂying, driving, or taking the train.
I cover planning resources that can be a big help for families,
seniors, travelers with disabilities, and GLBT travelers.
Finally, I go over the important details, from renting a car
(which I suggest you don’t do) to travel insurance to staying
in touch with home.

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Deciding how to spend your money
 Cutting the costs, but not the fun
 Getting, carrying, and keeping your funds
N
ew York has a way of devouring your cash. I walk a mere 5 blocks
and somehow wind up $20 lighter on a regular basis. With almost
as many ATMs (and their accompanying fees) as there are things to spend
money on, the Big Apple can be a budget-buster. But as long as you set
realistic goals for your spending and plan ahead, you don’t have to worry
about mortgaging the house to finance your trip. In this chapter, I share
ways you can get the best value for your dollar without going broke.
Planning Your Budget
New York has a reputation as one of the most expensive cities to live in,
not only in the United States, but in the world. So dismiss any notions
that you can get off on the very cheap here. But that reputation is also
somewhat exaggerated; you can spend a week in the Big Apple for some-
what less than a king’s ransom. In fact, you can make your trip to New
York wallet-friendly in lots of ways. You just have to know what you’re
doing and do a bit of groundwork.
Hotel
The biggest challenge in terms of saving money in New York is finding an
affordable place to stay. As I discuss in Chapter 9, a decent hotel room in
New York can run at least $250 per night, plus a hotel tax of 13.375 per-
cent. This expense is the biggest drain on your budget unless you want
to share a bathroom or explore a youth hostel. So look for bargains, but
be realistic. A hotel room is going to cost you some dough.
Transportation
First and foremost, pack comfortable walking shoes — walking is the
preferred mode of transportation in New York. Next, invest in a MetroCard
(the coin of the realm for public transportation). One ride on the subway
costs $2 (although you can purchase an “unlimited” MetroCard . . . more

about that in Chapter 8), and if you transfer to a bus, the transfer is free
with MetroCard. The New York subway system is a marvel. At times it is
overcrowded (avoid riding on it at rush hour), and in the summer, the
stations can be extremely toasty (even though all the trains are air-con-
ditioned), but no other means of transit can get you to your destination
within the city cheaper and faster. See Chapter 8 for more information
about getting around New York.
Buses, which accept both MetroCards and exact change, are also an
inexpensive alternative to the subway and a nice way to see the city. But
with many stops and the regular heavy traffic in Manhattan, they can be
extremely slow.
Yellow cabs are the city’s other great resource. They’re usually plentiful —
they say approximately 13,000 cabs are on the streets at any given time —
and you can usually get a cab without too much hassle (except on rainy
days and at the pre-theater hour). Cabs offer relatively affordable rides,
particularly if you’re in a group of up to three people. They’re also the
most convenient way to get to parts of town where the subway doesn’t
go. You pay $2.50 as soon as the cabbie turns on the meter, plus 40¢ per
1⁄5 mile or 30¢ per minute when stuck in traffic. You will also pay a 50¢
nighttime surcharge and a $1 surcharge Monday through Friday from 
4 to 8 p.m.
As signs all over Manhattan say: DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT PARKING HERE. If
you’re considering renting a car in New York or using your own car for
transportation around town, think again. (You can find more on parking
and driving in Chapter 7.)
Food
You can get every conceivable kind of food in New York at just about any
price. We all know about those three- and four-star restaurants that may
cost more than two nights at a New York hotel, but not as well-known
are those hidden gems (and there are plenty) that cost you less than $30
for an excellent meal. If you want to save even more, you can always get
pizza, bagels, hot dogs, falafel, and other (surprisingly) good street food
to satisfy your hunger pangs. Chapter 10 offers tips on selecting food
that fits both your appetite and your budget.
Sights
Entrance fees vary from attraction to attraction. If you’re planning on
visiting a lot of them, consider buying a CityPass, which gets you
reduced admission to six top attractions for $65 (a savings of 50 percent
off what you would pay for separate admissions). See Chapter 11 for
more information about places and things to see in the city.
Some attractions request a “suggested contribution” for admission, which
means that you can pay whatever you want. But be reasonable — if you
offer up a couple of dollars to get a family of six into the Metropolitan
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
38

Museum, you’re likely to get a sneer with your tickets. Some museums
also offer a free admission night, which, for obvious reasons, is usually
the busiest night of the week. See the individual museum listings in
Chapter 11 for details.
Shopping
When it comes to shopping, only you know how much you want to
spend. You can find bargains in New York on electronics and clothes
(especially now that clothes are a tax-free purchase in the city). But
unless you happen upon a sample sale or another sale, top designer
duds are going to cost you. (Of course, you can buy designer knockoffs
on the street, but the quality is somewhat less than the real thing, to say
the least.) See Chapter 12 for the best places offering the best gear.
Nightlife
Again, how much you spend on nightlife entertainment depends on what
you’re interested in doing. At the top end are Broadway shows, which
average $100 and up for the best seats, and supper clubs where you can
see a cabaret act for around $60, not including drinks. If you just want to
people-watch at a wine bar or pub around happy hour, you’ll be hard-
pressed to spend more than $20. See Chapters 14 and 15 to get an idea of
your many options.

Taxes
Regular sales tax is 8.375 percent — not a small amount, especially if you
buy expensive stuff. Remember that advertised prices, from restaurants
to hotels to most shops, almost always exclude sales tax. The prices in
this book also do not include sales tax.
There is no tax on clothing and footwear in New York City.
Hotel taxes run 13.375 percent. If you think this seems ridiculous, be
glad that you didn’t plan your trip a decade ago, when the hotel tax was
19.25 percent! (Occasionally, things in New York do get cheaper.) A room
charge of $3.50 per night is also added to your bill. Remember to ask
whether the price quoted to you includes these fees, both for travel
packages and hotel rooms; they can make quite a difference.
Tips
Bottom line: Expect to tip for every service you get in New York. Use the
following guidelines when tipping:
 Waiters: Simply double the tax on your bill and round up to the
nearest dollar (which is a tip of about 17 percent). Often, restau-
rants add the tip (15 percent to 20 percent) to the bill automatically
for parties of six or more.
 Bartenders: If you’re just drinking at a bar, 10 percent to 15 percent
takes care of it.
 Taxi drivers: No matter how bumpy the ride, tip 15 percent.
 Everybody else: Bellhops get $1 or $2 per bag; maids get $1 per
day; coat-check people get $1 per garment; and automobile valets
get $1.
Cutting Costs, but Not the Fun
You can cut costs in plenty of ways — some little and some big. Note the
Bargain Alert icons scattered throughout this book, which offer hints on
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
40

ways to trim the fat from your budget. While you’re planning a trip, keep
a few things in mind:
 Travel at off-peak times. Although New York doesn’t have a real off
season, the prices at some hotels during nonpeak times are half of
what they are during the peak travel seasons. (See Chapter 3 for a
discussion of the New York travel seasons.)
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less
than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for more
on package tours.)
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several hotels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
will save you money.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay $15 or $20 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. Lunch
tabs are usually a fraction of what dinner costs at most restaurants,
and the menu often offers many of the same specialties, in smaller
portions. Many of New York’s best restaurants participate in
Restaurant Week in January and June — $24 and some change nets
you a two- or three-course lunch — and some restaurants extend
this fixed-price bargain throughout the summer or even year-round.
 Don’t use the hotel phone. Some hotels in the moderate-to-expen-
sive range now offer free local calls from rooms, but don’t count on
it. Instead, if you have one, bring your cellphone and use it. (See
Chapter 7 for more info.)
 Stay away from the minibar. I know it’s tempting, but if you want a
snack, pick one up at the closest deli. Open that minibar and crack
open that can of peanuts . . . and then a beer, and before long
you’ve spent $20 on a snack.
 Use the buses and subways. Taxis get expensive quickly, especially
in gridlock traffic. (See Chapter 8 for hints on navigating the public-
transit system.)
 Buy a daily or weekly MetroCard pass. (See Chapter 8 for more
info about the MetroCard and its budget-saving powers.)
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save lots of money in
taxis and other transportation. Plus, you get to know your sur-
roundings more fully because you explore at a slower pace.
 Seek out small, local restaurants. Often, not only is the food less
expensive, but it’s also better than some of what you get at the big-
name tourist traps. (Turn to Chapter 10 for suggestions.)
 Visit museums that have a “suggested donation,” or go on the
nights that are free. (See Chapter 11 to find out which days and
nights are free at my favorite museums.)
 Buy your Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets at TKTS. You can
get same-day performances for some of Broadway’s best shows at
the TKTS booth in Times Square or downtown at the South Street
Seaport. (See Chapter 14 for more info.)
 Buy your drinks at happy hour. Many bars have happy hours, usu-
ally between the hours of 4 and 8 p.m. or thereabouts, when you
can save considerably on the price of a drink.
Handling Money
New York is one of the safest cities in the country, but that doesn’t 
mean you should go around carrying wads of cash (although you should
always make sure you have at least $20 in taxi fare on hand). In this sec-
tion, I tell you the best ways to access money in New York.
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. You’re probably
going to be moving around more and incurring more expenses than you
generally do (unless you happen to eat out every meal when you’re at
home), and you may let your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as
vigilant about your safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those fac-
tors aside, the only type of payment that isn’t quite as easy to use when
you’re away from home is your personal checkbook — some places
don’t accept out-of-town checks.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM,
sometimes referred to as a “cash machine” or “cashpoint.” The Cirrus
(% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587;
www.visa.com) networks span the globe; look at the back of your bank
card to see which network you’re on, and then call or check online for
ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you know your personal iden-
tification number (PIN) before you leave home and be sure to find out
your daily withdrawal limit before you depart. Also keep in mind that
many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a different
bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transactions 
(up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (they’re rarely more than $2).
On top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
42

own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees within the U.S., use www.bankrate.
com. For international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
If your own bank doesn’t have branches in New York, call to find out if
it’s affiliated with a bank in the city. Doing so may save you the extra
$1.50 or more charge for using a nonaffiliated ATM. Many banks limit the
amount of money per day that you can withdraw from an ATM; before
you depart, be sure you know your bank’s daily withdrawal limit.
ATMs are everywhere in New York, including in banks, supermarkets,
pharmacies, and delis. You can get cash at any hour of the day or night,
but you pay a higher surcharge at the non-bank-affiliated ATMs. Some
clubs (where there’s no reentry after you leave) have up to a $5 sur-
charge, so make sure you have enough cash on you when you go in.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances at banks or ATMs,
if you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you
had one, call the number on the back of your credit card and ask the
bank to send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business days.
Some credit cards let you get cash advances at ATMs. However, interest
rates for cash advances are often significantly higher than rates for
credit card purchases. More important, you start paying interest on the
advance the moment you receive the cash.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM with-
drawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — provided that
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-807-6233 (or % 800-221-7282, which accepts collect
calls, offers service in several foreign languages, and exempts Amex gold
and platinum cardholders from the 1 percent fee).
Visa (% 800-732-1322) and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920) also offer
traveler’s checks.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43

Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
As my brother discovered during his first trip to New York to visit me,
losing your wallet can put a serious damper on your trip. The good
Samaritan who found the wallet mailed it to my brother’s home two
weeks later with everything inside — except his cash, of course. That
was a best-case scenario, so you should take some precautionary steps
as soon as you discover your wallet has been lost or stolen.
Contact all your credit card companies and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police report number. Most credit card companies have an emergency
toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be able to
wire you a cash advance or deliver an emergency credit card in a day or
two. Call the following emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express: % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and trav-
eler’s check holders)
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa: % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call toll-free directory assistance at % 800-
555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft or fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289;

your airline and explain the situation; you may be allowed to board the
plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy
of the police report you’ve filed.

Chapter 5
Getting to New York City
In This Chapter
 Taking a plane, train, or automobile
 Choosing between a package and escorted tour
 Finding the best package or tour for your needs
You can get to New York in a variety of ways, depending on where
you’re starting from. Choosing the best mode of transit for your
needs and preference depends on distance, convenience, and cost. Are
you willing to arrange your own transportation? Or would you prefer to
have someone else make all the arrangements (such as a travel agent or
tour company)? When you arrive, do you want to explore the city by
yourself? Or do you want the company of a group? In this chapter, I give
you the pros and cons of each option.
Choosing the Airport
Three major airports serve New York City: LaGuardia, JFK (also known
as Kennedy or John F. Kennedy), and Newark Liberty. The city is easily
accessible from all three (see Chapter 8 for details on transportation
between airport and city), although choosing to arrive at one or another
may affect the price of your ticket. If you’re looking for the best price, be
flexible and accept a flight to any of these three airports. However, if
saving money isn’t your first priority, you may want to consider these
differences:
 LaGuardia Airport, in northern Queens, is the closest to Manhattan
(therefore, the cab rides are cheaper and get you to and from the
airport faster). It’s also the smallest of the three. Although the
number of flights allowed to arrive here has increased in recent
years, the choices are more limited than at the other two airports.
This is primarily a domestic, not an international, airport. Also, the
increased number of flights has led to an increase in delays.
 John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), in southern Queens,
is the official international airport for New York City. Its interna-
tional status makes it the largest and busiest airport in the metro
area in terms of the volume of arrivals and departures (although

Newark rivals it). Also, of the three major airports, it’s the farthest
from the city center.
 Newark International Airport is in New Jersey but is closer to
Manhattan than JFK, especially if you’re staying on the West Side or
downtown. However, in my experience, delays (and weather-related
cancellations) are even more frequent here than at LaGuardia and
Kennedy.
Two other airports in outlying areas service New York City: Westchester
Airport in White Plains, New York (25 miles north of the city), and
MacArthur Airport in Islip, Long Island (50 miles east of the city).
MacArthur is a major hub for budget carrier Southwest. However, the
inconvenience and high cost of getting into the city from these out-of-
the-way airports far outweigh the money you save by using them.
Flying to New York
If you’re in the Northeast or mid-Atlantic, flying may be only one of your
options for getting here (see the sections following on arriving by car,
train, and bus). If, however, you’re coming from farther away, then flying
is your best bet. You have a lot of options when it comes to airlines,
number of flights, and price range (from no-frills to first-class).
Finding out which airlines fly there
Almost every major domestic carrier serves a New York–area airport;
most serve two or all three. The major ones include
 American (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com)
 America West (% 800-235-9292; www.americawest.com)
 Continental (% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com)
 Delta (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com)
 JetBlue (% 800-538-2583; www.jetblue.com)
 Northwest (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com)
 United (% 800-241-6522; www.united.com)
 US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com)
In addition to the domestic airlines, many international carriers serve
JFK and Newark Liberty. Among the ones who offer the most frequent
service are
 Aer Lingus (% 800-474-7424 or 01-886-8888; www.aerlingus.ie)
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca)
 Air New Zealand (% 0800-737-767; www.airnewzealand.co.nz)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
46

 British Airways (% 0845-77-333-77; www-britishairways.com)
 Qantas (% 800-227-4500 or 612-9691-3636; www.qantas.com.au)
 Virgin Atlantic (% 0870-380-2007; www.virgin-atlantic.com)
Southwest Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com) frequently
offers cheap fares to New York from destinations across the country.
However, you’ll most likely land at MacArthur Airport, on Long Island
about 50 miles east of New York City.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other industry.
Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat is
a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and travel midweek
(Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive price —
usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops
within the United States, the full fare can be $1,000 or more, but a 7- or
14-day advance-purchase ticket may cost less than half of that amount.
Obviously, planning ahead pays.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. These sales tend to
take place in seasons of low travel volume — January through March in
New York. You almost never see a sale around the peak vacation months
of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many
people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Also keep an eye on price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as
airfarewatchdog.com and Farecast (www.farecast.com).
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but it does entitle you
to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and prompter service
if your luggage is lost or stolen, if your flight is canceled or delayed, or if
you want to change your seat. And you don’t have to fly to earn points;
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs
on the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the
program details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any
one. Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and,
of those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given
your most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best
advantage, consult Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.insideflyer.
com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and post 
regular updates on changes in policies and trends.
Chapter 5: Getting to New York City 47

Booking your flight online
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel 
agencies are Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.
expedia.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com). In the U.K., go to
TravelSupermarket (% 0845-345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.
com), a flight search engine that offers flight comparisons for the budget
airlines whose seats often end up in bucket-shop sales. Other Web sites
for booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights (www.cheap
flights.com), SmarterTravel.com, Priceline (www.priceline.com),
and Opodo (www.opodo.co.uk). Meta search sites (which find and then
direct you to airline and hotel Web sites for booking) include SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) and Kayak (www.kayak.com) — the latter includes
fares for budget carriers like Jet Blue and Spirit as well as the major air-
lines. A great source for last-minute flights and getaways is lastminute.
com. In addition, most airlines offer online-only fares that even their
phone agents know nothing about.
Driving to New York City
If you’re visiting from the Northeast or mid-Atlantic, certainly consider
driving your car; but just as certainly, park it after you get here.
Some long-term outdoor lots charge less than $35 a day for parking. You
can find them along the West Side Highway and in the 50s west of Eighth
Avenue. Also, ask if your hotel has an arrangement with a nearby park-
ing lot for a discount on its daily rate. Most do, but you may not have in-
and-out privileges.
You can also park near a commuter train station in New York, New Jersey,
or Connecticut and take the commuter rail into the city. You still have to
find parking near the station, but it’s somewhat cheaper than parking in
Manhattan. For information about PATH train stations in New Jersey,
contact the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey (% 800-234-7284;
www.panynj.gov). The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
New York City Transit (www.mta.info) operates not only the city’s sub-
ways and buses but also the Long Island Rail Road (% 718-217-5477),
which serves Long Island, and the Metro-North Railroad (% 212-532-
4900), which serves upstate New York and Connecticut.
Plan your arrival to avoid rush hours. Traffic jams can be dreadful at the
points of connection between the island of Manhattan and the surround-
ing metropolitan area (where all the airports are located). At rush hour,
tunnels and bridges clog up. And don’t think that you can get around the
traffic by “reverse commuting” — coming into the city when everybody
is leaving — because it doesn’t work that way. Even if most of the traffic
is outbound at around 5 p.m., a significant number of people commute
back to Manhattan and the number of inbound lanes is reduced to help
the traffic that’s leaving get out more quickly.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
48

Try to arrive well outside the peak hours of 8 to 10 a.m. and 4:30 to 7
p.m. The weekend rush is the worst. In summer, outbound traffic starts
as early as 2 p.m. on Fridays, and inbound traffic on Sunday evenings is
absolutely nightmarish.
Arriving by Other Means
If you don’t want to fly or drive, many modes of land-based transporta-
tion service New York City.
By train
New York is well served by Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com).
The most convenient route to New York City is the Northeast Corridor
line, which runs between Washington, D.C., and Boston. If you’re coming
from anywhere on this line, in my opinion taking the train is a lot smarter
and far more enjoyable than flying. The ride is likely to be shorter and
less stressful: You don’t have to commute to and from the airport; you
don’t need to be there two hours in advance to check in and struggle
through security, and there’s no waiting on the other end to collect your
luggage. The train is also more comfortable — no dry airplane air, more
freedom to stroll along the aisle, and more room to work or sleep; some
trains have a quiet car where chatter is disallowed (shhh!). Be sure to
book in advance.
The train isn’t necessarily cheaper. Prices on Amtrak remain high, but
there are specials and package tours worth looking into. Call or check
the Web site for information about special rates.
Amtrak trains arrive at Penn Station on the West Side, a hub for land
transportation in the heart of the city. The average round-trip fare to
New York on regular trains is around $126 from Boston (a 41⁄2-hour jour-
ney), $168 and up from Chicago (a 16- to 18-hour trip, usually overnight),
and $142 from Washington, D.C. (about 31⁄2 hours). Note that these are
coach fares, which means (except for Chicago) that seats are unreserved
and not guaranteed (that is, if all the seats are full, you have to stand).
You can reserve a seat in the pricier business-class and first-class
wagons if you don’t want to risk standing.
Amtrak’s Acela (www.amtrak.com) express train cuts down on travel
time, though you pay for it. For example, the New York–Boston run costs
about $220 round-trip. Travel on Acela between Washington, D.C., and
New York takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes; between Boston and New
York about 3 hours. Check the schedules, however; the additional cost
may not be worth shaving 15 or 20 minutes off your trip.
By bus
The bus can be a reasonable option for getting to New York City if you’re
coming from as far north as Boston, as far south as Washington, D.C.,
Chapter 5: Getting to New York City 49

and as far west as the middle of Pennsylvania. Offering express bus serv-
ice from several northeastern and mid-Atlantic cities, Peter Pan Bus
Lines (% 800-237-8747; www.peterpanbus.com) features wide-body
coaches equipped with viewing screens (which show movies during the
trip), climate control, and overhead storage compartments. Buses arrive
at the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue,
connecting to subways, city buses, and taxis.
For other regional bus companies (there are more than 20) that offer
runs to New York City, check with the Port Authority (% 212-564-8484;
www.panynj.gov/tbt/pabframe.HTM).
The bus is probably the cheapest way to reach New York from most
cities in the Northeast (with discount fares available for seniors, stu-
dents, and children, and occasional bargain-basement special sales).
Travel time from Washington, D.C., to New York City is between three
and four hours; from Philadelphia, usually less than two hours.
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront, and don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, don’t think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations either. Get
travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you more about
the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusandcosmos.com) sometimes
runs first-class independent tours of New York (often as part of a
larger, multi-city itinerary). A “host” is available to answer ques-
tions but doesn’t take you around the city, except on a designated
day. The package includes everything — hotel, local transporta-
tion, and even tips. Check the Web site for the most up-to-date tour
offerings.
 Maupintour (% 800-255-4266 or 913-843-1211; www.maupintour.
com) specializes in lavish “grand tours.” These escorted tours often
feature Broadway shows and an excursion to the Hudson Valley.
The cost of a tour may run about $2,000 per person depending on
the options you select, plus airfare.

For more information on escorted general-interest tours, including ques-
tions to ask before booking your trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations (including New York City, with its expensive
hotel rooms), package tours can be a smart way to go. In many cases, 
a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and ground transportation
costs less than the hotel alone when you book yourself. That’s because
packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, who resell them to the
public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a buy-in-bulk store —
except the tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-count box of
garbage bags and resells them 10 at a time at a cost that undercuts the
local supermarket.
Package tours can vary in terms of what’s provided. Some offer a better
class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for lower
prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In
some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be
limited. Some let you choose between escorted and independent vaca-
tions; others allow you to add on excursions or escorted day trips (also
at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
Here are a few options to consider:
 New York City Vacation Packages (% 888-692-8701;
www.nycvp.com) offers a wide variety of packages year-round,
some of them at unbeatable prices. Call, check the Web site, or
e-mail info@nycvp.com for information.
 NYC & Company (% 800-692-4843 or 800-692-8474;
www.nycvisit.com), the city’s Convention and Visitors Bureau,
offers special packages, usually during the slower first months of
the year.

N
ew York may seem intimidating, but if you can get over your initial
awe, you may find that things are easier for people with special
needs here than in other cities. New York offers so many things to see
and do that anybody can find something suitable, and specialized serv-
ices are available for just about everything and everyone.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
With all due respect to Disney World, New York is the true kid capital of
the United States. (And a focus group of three — my nieces and nephew,
who live in the House of The Mouse — supports me on this.) As long as
you come prepared, you can have a safe, enjoyable, enriching experi-
ence that the kids will long remember.
You can find good family-oriented New York vacation advice on the
Internet at sites such as the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravel
forum.com), a comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning;
Family Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-
winning site that offers travel features, deals, and tips; and Family
Travel Files (www.thefamilytravelfiles.com), which offers an online
magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators
for families.
Research all the places your family plans to visit; see Chapter 8 for
descriptions of New York’s neighborhoods.

Caregivers and children should go over safety issues before leaving (see
the Quick Concierge); be sure to create a plan so that children know
what to do if they get lost.
Finding a family-friendly hotel
Finding a hotel that caters to children may be your biggest concern. But
you’re in luck: Some New York hotels market special services just for
families, including play areas and children’s programs. Be sure to ask
about these services when you call for a reservation.
If your budget is a concern, look for a hotel that lets children stay in
your room for free. You may also want to consider getting a room with a
kitchenette; eating some meals in your room (or preparing and taking
food with you) can help defray food costs. In Chapter 9, look for the Kid
Friendly icons next to hotels that offer family-friendly options.
Getting around
If you and your children don’t want to tangle with public transportation
from the airport or around the city, you can always take taxis. But if your
children are patient enough, you can get almost anywhere on the bus or
subway. Make sure to review the safety tips I give in Chapter 8 and in the
Quick Concierge before hitting the road. (By the way, children under 3'8"
tall ride New York’s subways for free.)
Finding baby-sitting services
Many hotels have baby-sitting services or can provide lists of reliable
sitters. If your hotel can’t make a recommendation, try the Baby Sitters
Guild (% 212-682-0227; http://babysittersguild.com) or the Frances
Stewart Agency (% 212-439-9222; www.francesstewartagency.com).
These sitters are licensed, insured, and bonded and take your children
on an outing.
Touring the town
To help you plan outings with your children, look for the Kid Friendly
icons throughout this book, which point out places of particular interest
to children. You’ll find this icon next to such sights as the Bronx Zoo,
Central Park Zoo, and Central Park. For more information about planning
activities for children, pick up a copy of the excellent Frommer’s New
York City with Kids (Wiley). Full disclosure: I edited a couple editions of
the guide.
Time Out New York, a magazine that comes out every Wednesday (and is
available online at www.timeoutny.com), is an excellent source for find-
ing out about child-friendly activities and events. Look for the “Kids” list-
ings. In addition, you can pick up Time Out New York Kids, which helps
to steer you in the right direction for fun with your kids.

For teenagers, some neighborhoods may be more interesting than
others. Downtown neighborhoods (such as Chelsea, the East and West
Villages, SoHo, NoHo, and Nolita) have younger crowds, coffee shops,
and funky clothing stores. (For more-detailed descriptions of these
neighborhoods, see Chapter 8.) Fans of MTV’s Total Request Live may
want to check out the show’s Times Square studios.
Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although none of the major U.S. airlines offers senior dis-
count and coupon-book programs anymore, many hotels still offer
senior discounts. In most cities, New York included, people over the age
of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation.
Members of AARP (% 888-687-2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org)
get discounts on hotels, airfares, and car rentals. AARP offers members a
range of benefits, including AARP The Magazine and a monthly newslet-
ter. Anyone over 50 years of age can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those aged 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of any
age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around the
world. Recent offerings for New York City include “Five Days, Five
Boroughs” and “Great Art Centers in New York.”
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500;
www.gct.com); and Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures
That You Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50, by Joann
Rattner Heilman (McGraw-Hill).
Seniors get a 50 percent discount on bus and subway fares in New York
(see the following section for more info). Be sure to carry identification
with proof of age.
Accessing New York City: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling because more
options and resources exist than ever before. In general, New York is

Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 55
progressive in its efforts to make the city accessible for the disabled.
Equal access is now mandated by law, but implementation has been
gradual and is not complete.
Travel agencies and organizations
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Among them are Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-
5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com), Access-Able Travel Source
(% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com), and Accessible Journeys
(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com). Big
Apple Greeter (% 212-669-2896 or 212-669-8273 TTY; www.bigapple
greeter.org) offers tours for travelers with disabilities free of charge.
Advance reservations are necessary.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org); the American Foundation for
the Blind (AFB; % 800-232-5463; www.afb.org); the New York Society
for the Deaf (% 212-777-3900 TTY; www.nysd.org); and Society for
Accessible Travel and Hospitality, (SATH; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.
org). SATH offers a wealth of travel resources for people with all types of
disabilities and recommends access guides, travel agents, tour opera-
tors, companion services, and more. Annual membership costs $45 for
adults and $30 for seniors and students. AirAmbulanceCard.com is now
partnered with SATH and allows you to preselect top-notch hospitals in
case of an emergency.
Hospital Audiences, Inc. (% 212-575-7676 or 212-575-7673 TTY; www.
hospitalaudiences.org), has various programs including “Describe!”
which allows theatergoers who are blind or visually impaired to enjoy
theater with audio-describers giving a summary of the action onstage.
The Web site provides accessibility information to performance and art
venues and about programs that are signed for the hearing impaired.
For more information targeted to travelers with disabilities, check out
the magazine Emerging Horizons (www.emerginghorizons.com) and
Open World Magazine, published by SATH.
Hotels
Some older budget hotels have not been updated to current access regu-
lations. However, many hotels, including chains such as Hilton, offer fea-
tures that accommodate wheelchairs, like roll-in showers, lower sinks,
and extra space for maneuverability. Simply ask for one of these accessi-
ble rooms when you make your reservation.
Transportation
Taxis are required by law to take persons with disabilities, wheelchairs,
and guide dogs. For getting into the city from one of the airports, the

Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
56
Gray Line Shuttle (% 800-451-0455 or 212-315-3006; www.grayline.com)
has minibuses with lifts. The vans go only to Midtown hotels, and you
must make a reservation to get a ride.
All buses in Manhattan and 95 percent of New York City buses are
equipped with wheelchair lifts and seating areas where the bus seats
fold up to make extra room. The buses also “kneel,” lowering their front
ends so that the first step is more accessible. Wheelchair passengers
don’t have to request these bus services in advance; just show up at the
bus stop. The driver can help put a wheelchair on the ramp and secure
the chair inside the bus.
Subway access for travelers with disabilities is limited, but the MTA New
York City Transit is increasing accessibility. You can certainly experience
the thrill of a New York subway ride by boarding and getting off at the
accessible stations, but the bus is a much more flexible option. Also,
out-of-service subway elevators are not unheard of, and the MTA really
needs to get its act together on that.
The following are a few major wheelchair-accessible stations and lines in
Manhattan:
 Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall (4, 5, 6)
 West 4th Street (A, B, C, D, E, F, V)
 14th Street/Union Square (4, 5, 6, N, Q, R, W)
 34th Street/Herald Square (B, D, F, N, Q, R, V, W)
 42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal (A, C, E)
 Grand Central/42nd Street (4, 5, 6)
 50th Street (southbound only, C, E)
 51st Street (6)
 Lexington/63rd Street (F)
 66th Street/Lincoln Center (1, 2)
 125th Street (4, 5, 6)
 175th Street (A)
 Roosevelt Island (F)
Accessible stations are marked with an icon on the free subway map dis-
tributed in the subway. You also can get the MTA Guide to Accessible
Transit at www.mta.info/mta/ada (large-print, Braille, and audiotape
versions are available by calling % 718-330-3322). Braille subway maps
are also available from Lighthouse International, 111 E. 59th St., New
York, NY 10022 (% 800-829-0500 or 212-821-9200), which also produces
concerts and exhibitions by the vision impaired.

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for GLBT Travelers
New York ranks with San Francisco as one of the most gay-friendly cities
in the United States. Greenwich Village and Chelsea have large gay popu-
lations, and the Village and Chelsea offer abundant nightlife.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for GLBT

Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Renting a car . . . not!
 Playing it safe
 Staying healthy and connected
 Finding the latest security tips
D
etails, details, details. Who wants to spoil the fun of planning some
big-city sightseeing and shopping by worrying about Internet access
and travel insurance? But paying attention to these less-interesting details
now can spare you many last-minute hassles. Go over the points in this
chapter so that you can enjoy a worry-free trip.
Renting a Car: Not in New York!
One of the first questions that often comes to mind when organizing a
trip is: “Do I need to rent a car?” In New York, the answer is clear: No!
You just don’t need one; New York is a great walking city, and you can
take fast and cheap public transportation almost anywhere. Need I men-
tion that gas is expensive; parking is a nightmare; and driving the city
streets is — more often than not — a high-speed, high-stakes game of
dodge-’em that’s not for the weak of heart?
Playing It Safe: Travel and Medical Insurance
The types of insurance travelers are most likely to need are trip-
cancellation insurance and medical insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a
dozen companies.

U.K. citizens who make more than one trip abroad per year may 
find an annual travel-insurance policy works out cheaper. Check
Moneysupermarket (www.moneysupermarket.com), which compares
prices across a range of providers for single- and multi-trip policies.
Most big travel agents offer their own insurance and will probably try to
sell you their package when you book a holiday. Britain’s Consumers’
Association recommends that you insist on seeing the policy and read-
ing the fine print before buying travel insurance. The Association of
British Insurers (% 020-7600-3333; www.abi.org.uk) gives advice by
phone and publishes Holiday Insurance, a free guide to policy provisions
and prices. You might also shop around for better deals: Try Columbus
Direct (% 0870-033-9988; www.columbusdirect.net).
Here’s my advice on trip-cancellation and medical insurance:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Trip-cancellation insurance tradi-
tionally covers such events as sickness, natural disasters, and State
Department advisories. The latest news in trip-cancellation insur-
ance is the availability of expanded hurricane coverage and the
“any-reason” cancellation coverage — which costs more but covers
cancellations made for any reason. You won’t get back 100 percent
of your prepaid trip cost, but you’ll be refunded a substantial por-
tion. TravelSafe (% 888-885-7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers
both types of coverage. Expedia also offers any-reason cancellation
coverage for its air-hotel packages. For details, contact one of the
following insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.access
america.com); Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.
travelguard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174;
www.travelinsured.com), or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go.
International visitors to the United States should note that unlike
many European countries, the U.S. does not usually offer free or
low-cost medical care to its citizens or visitors. Doctors and hospi-
tals are expensive and, in most cases, will require advance payment
or proof of coverage before they render their services. Good policies
will cover the costs of an accident, repatriation, or death. Packages
such as Europ Assistance’s Worldwide Healthcare Plan are sold
by European automobile clubs and travel agencies at attractive
rates. Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc. (% 800-777-8710; www.
worldwideassistance.com), is the agent for Europ Assistance in
the U.S. Though lack of health insurance may prevent you from
being admitted to a hospital in non-emergencies, don’t worry about
being left on a street corner to die: The American way is to fix you
now and bill you later.

If you’re ever hospitalized more than 150 miles from home,
MedjetAssist (% 800-527-7478; www.medjetassistance.com) 
will pick you up and fly you to the hospital of your choice in a med-
ically equipped and staffed aircraft 24 hours day, 7 days a week.
Annual memberships are $225 individual, $350 family; you can also
purchase short-term memberships.
Canadians should check with their provincial health-plan offices 
or call Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to
find out the extent of their coverage and what documentation and
receipts they must take home if they’re treated in the U.S.
Travelers from the U.K. should carry their European Health Insurance
Card (EHIC), which replaced the E111 form as proof of entitlement
to free/reduced-cost medical treatment abroad (% 0845-606-2030;
www.ehic.org.uk). Note, however, that the EHIC only covers “neces-
sary medical treatment”; for repatriation costs, lost money, baggage,
or trip cancellation, you should buy travel insurance from a reputable
company. For recommendations, visit www.travelinsuranceweb.
com, a site where you can purchase for insurance for your trip-
specific needs.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick can ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the germs weren’t listening to me). New York
won’t make you sick more than any other city, and New York City tap
water is some of the nation’s finest. Beyond that, take this basic advice
for keeping your health in tiptop shape.
For information on purchasing additional medical insurance for your
trip, see the previous section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298;
www.medicalert.org), which alerts doctors to your condition and
gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-
3435; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards
by region or country and offers tips on food safety. Travel Health Online
(www.tripprep.com), sponsored by a consortium of travel-medicine
practitioners, may also offer helpful advice on travel health.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
Staying in touch with the folks at home (or with each other) is much
easier these days thanks to the rapidly expanding cellphone networks
and various plans that give you plenty of unlimited minutes. Access to
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 61

the Internet from your phone or at hotel or public terminals (or from
your own laptop, via Wi-Fi, or via a handy modem cord and plug) also
makes communicating while traveling much less complicated.
Using a cellphone across the U.S.
If you don’t have a cellphone and you need one during your stay in 
New York, rent a phone from InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.
intouchglobal.com) or a rental-car location, but it’ll be a hefty $1 a
minute or more for airtime.
If you’re not from the U.S., you’ll be appalled at the poor reach of our
Global System for Mobiles (GSM) wireless network, which is used by
much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in New
York and most major U.S. cities. (To see where GSM phones work in the
U.S., check out www.t-mobile.com/coverage.) And you may or may
not be able to send SMS (text messaging) home.
If you have Web access while traveling, consider a broadband-based
telephone service — Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) — such as
Skype (www.skype.com) or Vonage (www.vonage.com), which allow you
to make free international calls from your laptop or in a cybercafe.
Neither requires the people you’re calling to also have that service
(though there are fees if they don’t). Check the Web sites for details.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a phone, personal
digital assistant (PDA), or electronic organizer with a modem — gives
you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can
still access your e-mail and even your office computer.
Without your computer
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists — these are 
independent businesses, after all — one place to start looking is
www.cybercafe.com.
Some of the places you can check your e-mail in New York include:
 Times Square Information Center, 1560 Broadway (between 46th
and 47th streets; % 212-768-1560; www.timessquarenyc.org;
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.)
 CyberCafe, in Times Square at 250 W. 49th St. (between Broadway
and Eighth Avenue; % 212-333-4109; www.cyber-cafe.com) and in
SoHo at 273 Lafayette St. (at Prince Street; % 212-334-5140)
 FedEx Kinko’s, at numerous locations, including 100 Wall St. (at
Water Street; % 212-269-0024), near City Hall at 105 Duane St.
(between Broadway and Church Street; % 212-406-1220), 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
62

245 Seventh Ave. (at 24th Street; % 212-929-2679), 60 W. 40th St.
(between Fifth and Sixth avenues; % 212-921-1060), and 221 W.
72nd St. (at Broadway; % 212-362-5288)
 New York Public Library — the central branch libraries around
town offer free Internet access; check the Web site (www.nypl.org/
branch) for branch locations.
Finding other ways to surf the Web
Aside from cybercafes, most budget hotels have at least one computer
you can use to access the Internet. Avoid hotel business centers unless
you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates. (More hotels offer free Internet
access in their business centers, but it’s not something they all do.)
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you may also see in shopping malls,
hotel lobbies, and tourist-information offices, give you basic Internet
access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices.
Avoid them whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. If you 
need to access files on your office computer, look into a service called
GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-based
interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from anywhere —
even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an always-on
connection to the Internet.
With your own computer
More and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as Wi-Fi hotspots
from which you can get high-speed connection without cable wires, net-
working hardware, or a phone line. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.
com/hotspot) serves up wireless connections at Starbucks coffee shops
and FedEx Kinko’s nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport
(www.wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class
hotel lobbies. Bryant Park, between 40th and 42nd streets and Fifth and
Sixth avenues (www.bryantpark.org/amenities/wireless.php), is 
a Wi-Fi hotspot, as are the New York Public Library and its branch
libraries around town (www.nypl.org/branch/services/wifi.html).
To locate other hotspots that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world, go to JiWire (www.jiwire.com).
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and many
hotels offer free high-speed Internet access.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 63

Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, procedures at U.S. airports
are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you won’t be
delayed if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight; if
you show up late, tell an airline employee so that he might whisk you
away to the front of the line.
Don’t leave home without a current, government-issued photo ID, such
as a driver’s license or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at
check-in, at the security checkpoint, and sometimes even at the gate.
(Children under 18 don’t need government-issued photo IDs for domes-
tic flights.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets
have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can
beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or online
check-in from your home computer. Online check-in involves logging on
to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out
your boarding pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles 
to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card you
used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your board-
ing pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint
with your pass and a photo ID. Curbside check-in is also a good way 
to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call
before you go.
Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buck-
les. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can pre-
vent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item” (such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag). You can stuff all
sorts of things into a laptop bag — as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still
considered a personal item. In any of your carry-on items, check on the
restrictions on liquids and gels, if you’re carrying your personal toi-
letries. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a
list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/
index.jsp) for what you can and can’t bring onboard.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is nec-
essary. Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.

W
hether you’re landing at one of the three major area airports,
alighting from Amtrak, or taking the family car to New York City,
this chapter helps you get to where you’re going.
Getting from the Airport to Your Hotel
The New York airports are located away from the center of things —
LaGuardia and Kennedy are in the borough of Queens, and Newark
Airport is across the Hudson River in New Jersey. From any of these air-
ports, taking a taxi is the easiest and most hassle-free option, but it’s
also the most expensive. Another possibility is to use a car service or
van service (see the following sections for information). At the cheaper
end, you can take a bus or a train.
If you take a cab, make sure that a uniformed, official taxi dispatcher
hails your cab. Always stand in the official taxi line and take a licensed
New Jersey taxi or New York City yellow cab. If someone approaches you
offering a cab ride, just keep walking toward the cab line; illegal drivers,
who may take you on an unwelcome ride, abound at all three main air-
ports. Remember that taxis are required by law to take no more than
four people, and you should always tip 15 percent of the fare, regardless
of whether the driver helps you with your bags.

From JFK
John F. Kennedy International (JFK) is New York’s largest airport. Its sev-
eral terminals are located along a great loop. Each terminal has a taxi
stand, bus stops, and car-service pickup points. After collecting your
luggage, follow the GROUND TRANSPORTATION signs or the signs for the clos-
est exit to the transportation of your choice.
A cab from JFK to Manhattan takes about 45 minutes, depending on the
traffic (which can be fierce), and costs a flat rate of $45 plus tolls and 
tip. The toll is $5 cash/$4.15 EZ-Pass for the Queens Midtown Tunnel 
and the Triborough Bridge; the Queensborough Bridge is free, as are the
Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges, but they can get very crowded.
Still, if your destination is downtown and the Williamsburg and Manhattan
bridges are free of construction, they should be your best bets to get
into the city quickly. Your cabdriver should know the fastest way into
town considering the traffic situation. You have to pay a 50¢ night sur-
charge between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., and a $1 surcharge Monday through
Friday from 4 to 8 p.m.
A private car service (a “limo” in New York–ese) is another option. In
fact, a ride in a private car can cost a little less than a cab ride. Also, the
driver meets you just outside the baggage-claim area, so you don’t have
to wait in line for a cab. Following are some of the car companies that
service JFK; call ahead for a reservation:
 Allstate: % 800-453-4099 or 212-333-3333; www.allstatelimo.com
 Carmel: % 800-922-7635 or 212-666-6666; www.carmellimo.com
 Dial 7: % 800-777-8888 or 212-777-7777; www.dial7.com
Another possibility is to take a shared transportation service (a “minivan”
in New York lingo). Follow the GROUND TRANSPORTATION signs upon your
arrival and sign up at one of the desks. Options include the following:
 New York Airport Service (% 800-872-4577, 718-875-8200, or
212-875-8200; www.nyairportservice.com) offers regular bus
service to and from Manhattan. The buses stop outside each termi-
nal at JFK; follow the directions to ground transportation and wait
by the sign. When boarding the bus at the airport, purchase your
ticket on the bus or from the dispatcher at the sign. Buses leave
every 20 minutes.
The bus makes four stops in Manhattan: across from Grand Central
Terminal (the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Park Avenue),
Bryant Park, the Port Authority Bus Terminal (42nd Street and
Eighth Avenue), and Penn Station (1 Penn Plaza between 31st and
33rd streets, just off Seventh Avenue). The price is $15 one-way or
$27 round-trip; children under 12 ride free, but watch out for the
limit of one free child per full-fare adult. Discounted rates are avail-
able for students and seniors, but only if tickets are purchased
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 69

from the ticket counters in Manhattan. Add $5 for the Midtown
Hotel Shuttle, which serves hotels between 31st and 60th streets.
When you leave New York, you can take the bus service from any of
these four stops, but you need to call 24 hours in advance to
reserve a hotel pickup.
 SuperShuttle (% 800-258-3826 or 212-258-3826; www.supershuttle.
com) has vans on call 24 hours a day to all destinations in Manhattan.
The price is $19 to or from the airport if you’re staying at a hotel; if
you’re staying at a residential address, the price is $21 to or from
the airport for the first passenger in your party and $12 for each
additional passenger; children under 3 ride free. You can reserve 
in advance for your pickup to head back to the airport.
Last and least is public transportation. Going from JFK to Manhattan by
public transportation is really cheap but really time-consuming. This
option is best reserved for those traveling light and with more time than
money. A few bumpy years after opening in 2003, AirTrain JFK is operat-
ing more efficiently. And you can’t beat the price — only $7 if you take 
a subway to the AirTrain, $12 if you take Long Island Rail Road. From
Midtown Manhattan, the ride can take anywhere from 40 minutes to an
hour, depending on your connections. Subway lines that connect with
the AirTrain are the A, E, J, and Z; the E, J, Z to Jamaica Station and
Sutphin Blvd.–Archer Ave. Station, and the A to Howard Beach/JFK
Airport Station. The MTA is contemplating adding connections to the
AirTrain in lower Manhattan sometime in the next decade, but there’s
not much they can do now to speed up the trip.
From LaGuardia
Smaller than JFK, LaGuardia receives fewer flights than its two New
York–area counterparts — but, paradoxically, it experiences more flight
delays, according to the FAA. Just step outside the terminal at the bag-
gage-claim level for ground transportation.
The metered fare for a taxi ride from LaGuardia to Midtown runs about
$30 plus tolls and tip. The toll is $5 ($4.15 with EZ-Pass) for the Queens
Midtown Tunnel and Triborough Bridge; the Queensborough Bridge is
free, as are the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges. Allow 30 minutes
or more for this trip, depending on traffic.
A private car service is also an option (see “From JFK,” earlier in this chap-
ter). Call ahead to one of these reliable car companies for a reservation:
 Allstate: % 800-453-4099 or 212-333-3333; www.allstatelimo.com
 Carmel: % 800-922-7635 or 212-666-6666; www.carmellimo.com
 Dial 7: % 800-222-9888 or 212-777-7777; www.dial7.com
New York Airport Service (% 800-872-4577, 718-706-9658, or 718-875-
8200; www.nyairportservice.com) also serves LaGuardia. It offers the
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
70

same service to and from LaGuardia as for JFK (see “From JFK,” earlier
in this chapter). Buses leave every 20 minutes, and the cost is $12 one-
way or $21 round-trip (children under 12 free, discounted rates for stu-
dents and seniors available only from the service’s ticket counters in
Manhattan). Add $6 for the Midtown Hotel Shuttle service.
Shared transportation services are a good option from LaGuardia as
well. Follow the GROUND TRANSPORTATION signs upon your arrival and sign
up at one of the desks.
SuperShuttle (% 800-258-3826 or 212-258-3826; www.supershuttle.com)
has vans on call 24 hours a day to all destinations in Manhattan. The
price is $16 to and from the airport if you’re going to a hotel; if you’re
staying at a private residence, the price is $16 to or from the airport for
the first passenger in your party and $12 for each additional passenger.
Children under 3 ride free. You can reserve in advance for pickup to go
back to the airport.
As for public transportation, the M60 bus gets you from the airport to a
choice of subway stops: first the Astoria Boulevard stop in Queens on
the N or W line, and then into Manhattan at one of the subway stops 
on 125th Street (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, A, B, C, or D subway lines), and finally to
Cathedral Parkway/110th Street and 116th Street/Columbia University on
the 1 subway line. Another possibility: The Q48 and Q33 buses bring
you to a stop of the 7 train in Queens, which eventually takes you to
Times Square. Curbside bus signs and stops are clearly marked. If you’re
using the bus-and-subway system’s MetroCard, you’re allowed free
transfers to approved connecting buses and subways within two hours
of initial card use. In both cases, you face a complicated, two-hour
odyssey that you shouldn’t attempt unless you’re really looking to save
money.
From Newark
Although it’s in New Jersey, Newark is closer to Manhattan than JFK,
especially if your final destination is downtown or the West Side of
Manhattan. The AirTrain to Newark airport has been a revelation, con-
necting Newark’s three terminals with the long-term parking lots and
with the Rail Link (the railroad station of Newark Airport). From there,
you can catch a train directly into New York Penn Station ($12). See the
end of this section for details.
The price of a cab from Newark to Manhattan is the metered fare (often
around $30) plus a $15 surcharge, to which you add toll and tip. You pay
a $6 inbound-only toll (toward Manhattan) for either the Holland Tunnel
or the Lincoln Tunnel, and you should tip 15 percent. You’ll most likely
take a New Jersey cab on the way in and a New York cab on the way
back to the airport. The trip takes about 40 minutes each way, assuming
traffic is moving.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 71

You can take a private bus as well. Olympia Airport Express (% 212-
964-6233; www.olympiabus.com) offers regular service between Newark
and destinations in Manhattan for $15 each way or $25 round-trip (chil-
dren under 12 ride free, seniors and travelers with disabilities pay $7.50
one-way or $15 round-trip). Buses run every 20 minutes, and the ride
takes 30 minutes or longer, depending on traffic. From the Grand Central
Station stop (at 120 E. 41st St., between Park and Lexington avenues),
you can transfer to Olympia Trails’ Midtown Shuttle, which takes you to
any destination between 30th and 65th streets for an additional $5 (you
can purchase the ticket at the airport). Other stops in Manhattan are
Bryant Park (Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street) and the Port Authority Bus
Terminal (gates 316 and 317 at the Airport Bus Center, on 42nd Street
between Eighth and Ninth avenues).
In the airport, follow the GROUND TRANSPORTATION signs and stop at the
Olympia Airport Express counter, or go directly to the bus stop outside
that corresponds to your destination; you can buy your ticket at the
counter or from the driver. If you’re traveling from Manhattan, you can
find a dispatcher on duty at the bus stop at 34th Street and Eighth
Avenue and a counter in the Airport Bus Center; at the 41st Street stop,
you can buy your ticket from the Western Union office or from the
driver.
Another possibility is to take a minivan. Follow the signs for GROUND
TRANSPORTATION upon your arrival and sign up at this desk. SuperShuttle
(% 800-258-3826 or 212-258-3826; www.supershuttle.com) has vans on
call 24 hours a day to all destinations in Manhattan. The price is $19 to
or from the airport if you’re going to a hotel; if you’re staying at a private
residence, the price is $21 from the airport for the first passenger in
your party and $12 for any additional passengers; children under 3 ride
free. You can reserve in advance for pickup to go back to the airport.
You also can take public transportation:
 To get to the AirTrain (% 800-772-2222 or 973-762-5100; www.
airtrainnewark.com) from your terminal, take the airport mono-
rail (monorail stations are located in each terminal) to the Rail Link
station served by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit, where you can
catch a direct train to New York Penn Station (a 20-minute ride).
Trains run every 20 minutes on weekdays and every half-hour on
weekends; service is less frequent in the evening after 9 p.m. A one-
way trip on New Jersey Transit is $12 for adults and $9.05 for chil-
dren and seniors. Purchase tickets from the automated vending
machines in the station; if you purchase a ticket from the conduc-
tor on the train, add $5 to the price.
 An even cheaper option is to catch a New Jersey Transit train to
Newark Penn Station (a five-minute ride; $6.80 adults and $5.80 
children and seniors), where you can hop a PATH train to Manhattan.
The PATH train works quite well and costs only $1.75. From Newark,
the train makes four stops in New Jersey and five stops in Manhattan,
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
72

which are Christopher Street (in Greenwich Village on Hudson
Street), 9th Street, 14th Street, 23rd Street, and 33rd Street, all along
Sixth Avenue. Allow about 40 minutes for the trip between Newark
Penn Station and 33rd Street.
 Note that the PATH train to Manhattan is very crowded with com-
muters during morning rush hour and from Manhattan during the
evening rush hour. If you’re toting luggage, paying the extra $3 to
take the train directly to New York Penn Station is far easier.
From MacArthur Airport (Long Island)
Although I don’t recommend flying into MacArthur Airport in Islip, Long
Island, 50 miles east of Manhattan, the budget airline Southwest flies
there. So if you get a rock-bottom fare, you may decide it’s worth it to fly
into MacArthur. Be aware that taxi service into the city is not available
from there, but you can reserve a private car, which costs about $125 
for a 11⁄2-hour trip. Call Colonial Transportation (% 631-589-3500;
www.colonialtransportation.com) for reservations (which sort of
defeats the purpose of a really low fare).
Another option is to take the shuttle, also run by Colonial Transportation
(a white van marked EXPRESS SERVICE) from outside the terminal to the
Ronkonkoma train station. From there you can take the Long Island Rail
Road (% 718-217-5477) into New York Penn Station. A shuttle comes
every 20 minutes and costs $5; the train ride costs about $10, depending
on the time of day. The trip takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Finally, you can use the Hampton Jitney (% 631-283-4600; www.
hamptonjitney.com). Take a local cab to the Jitney’s bus stop in
Ronkonkoma for about $15, and then catch the bus (a 11⁄2-hour ride) into
Manhattan for $27.
Arriving by Train
As I mention in Chapter 5, Amtrak offers regular service to New York
from many cities. Amtrak trains arrive at Penn Station (between Seventh
and Eighth avenues and 31st and 33rd streets), a large, noisy space with
fast-food outlets galore and cramped waiting areas.
From the station, you can take a cab to wherever you’re headed; signs
guide you to the taxi stand on Penn Plaza Drive, a passageway situated
between Penn Station (close to Eighth Avenue) and the Long Island Rail
Road Terminal (LIRR, close to Seventh Avenue).
Another option is public transportation; the station is well connected
with the 1, 2, 3, A, C, or E trains and several buses. However, this isn’t
the best alternative, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the city and you
have a lot of luggage. Elevators are sparse in subway stations, so count
on lugging your bags up and down multiple flights of stairs.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 73

Arriving by Car
I don’t recommend having a car in New York for the reasons I outline in
Chapter 7. If you decide to arrive by car, you’ll immediately understand
why I try to dissuade you. I have driven highways and byways all over
the United States, and I still find the drive into New York City to be the
most consistently confusing and teeth-gnashing trip in the country.
You know you’re approaching New York when the traffic and signs multi-
ply beyond all expectations. Open your eyes and sharpen your senses; if
you’re unfamiliar with the tangle of highways, thoroughfares, and park-
ways, then getting into Manhattan can be a nerve-racking experience.
Remember that you won’t find signs for Manhattan; signs give the names
of specific tunnels, bridges, and streets instead.
If you arrive from the west or south, the New Jersey Turnpike is your
jumping-off point to Manhattan. Take exit 14C for the Holland Tunnel
(which lets you out around Canal Street in Manhattan), exit 16E for the
Lincoln Tunnel (which deposits you in far-west Midtown at 42nd Street),
or exit 18, the turnpike’s end, for the George Washington Bridge (which
lets you out at 181st Street, far uptown). The inbound-only toll (toward
Manhattan) is $6; you pay no outbound toll (you’re free to leave, so to
speak).
From the north, take the Deegan Expressway (I-87); from the northeast,
take the New England Thruway (I-95) to the Bruckner Expressway. To
get to the East Side of Manhattan, follow the signs to the Triborough
Bridge ($5 toll in both directions, $4.15 with EZ-Pass), but then be care-
ful to follow the signs to FDR Drive and avoid going on to Queens —
unless that’s your destination. FDR Drive runs along the East River all
the way to the southern tip of Manhattan and has exits at different
points. If you want to get to the West Side of Manhattan, exit I-87 at the
Sawmill River Parkway and follow it to the Henry Hudson Parkway, pass
the Henry Hudson Bridge (a $2.75 toll, $1.90 with EZ-Pass), and you can
find yourself on the West Side Highway, which runs along the Hudson
on the west side of the island and has exits at different streets.
When approaching a toll plaza, stay in the lanes marked CASH and not EZ-
PASS (unless, of course, you have an EZ-Pass). EZ-Pass is a toll payment
system where a scanner identifies your car by an electronic tag mounted
on your windshield and deducts the toll from a prepaid account. No
attendants staff the EZ-Pass booths, so you can’t pay cash in those lanes.
If you’re coming from the Northeast, many of the contiguous states have
an EZ-Pass program, and your tag will work in New York City.
The Cross Bronx Expressway runs east–west and connects to the
George Washington Bridge; you can use it to get to whichever side of the
island you want, but its traffic jams are infamous (especially on days
when the Yankees play at home).
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
74

After you’re on the West Side Highway or FDR Drive, take the exit closest
to your destination — all exits have street names — and calm down:
You’ve made it to New York!
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Getting to know New York and all its neighborhoods is easy (see the
“Manhattan Neighborhoods” map). Most of the city’s famous sights are
on the island of Manhattan, bounded by the Hudson River to the west
and the East River — guess where? — to the east. With the exception of
a few of the downtown streets, the main avenues run north–south and
the streets run east–west.
Downtown
“Downtown” is both a place and a state of mind; physically, everything
below 14th Street is considered downtown. Chelsea, the Flatiron District,
and Gramercy Park are not, strictly speaking, downtown, but I’ve included
them in this section because they’re in that nebulous zone that’s neither
downtown nor Midtown.
Lower Manhattan and the Financial District
Lower Manhattan is where the city was born and as a result, the area is
home to some of the most important historic landmarks, including
Trinity Church, South Street Seaport, and the Brooklyn Bridge.
Much of the area is considered the Financial District. Until September
11, 2001, the Financial District was anchored by the World Trade Center,
with the World Financial Center complex and Battery Park City to the
west, and Wall Street running crosstown a little south and to the east.
Now, a construction site occupies where the Twin Towers and five other
buildings stood.
Ground Zero has been cleaned, and a temporary PATH station has
reopened. Designs for what will eventually be constructed on the site
have finally been approved, but it will be years before those designs are
fully realized. (For more information about visiting the World Trade
Center site, see Chapter 11.)
City Hall remains the northern border of the district, abutting Chambers
Street. Most of the streets of this neighborhood are narrow concrete
canyons, with Broadway serving as the main uptown–downtown artery.
Just about all the major subway lines congregate here before they either
end or head to Brooklyn.
Since September 11, 2001, lower Manhattan has revitalized itself and
now has much to offer. The local community has united to promote the
area. Check out www.lowermanhattan.info and www.downtownny.com
for useful information on new developments and exciting events that
you can find downtown. Both are updated daily.

TriBeCa, Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side
TriBeCa, the acronym for the Triangle Below Canal (Street), is one of the
city’s priciest neighborhoods. It’s an area of residential lofts, as well as
the home of some highly fashionable restaurants. Trendy doesn’t trans-
late into big crowds, though; the neighborhood, especially at night,
tends to be quiet. Canal Street runs straight across the island, going
through the heart of Chinatown, which lies to the east of TriBeCa.
Chinatown is a sprawling neighborhood that bursts with shops selling
Asian wares, cheap souvenirs, bootleg DVDs, and counterfeit watches,
bags, and sunglasses (more about these in Chapter 12). The streets are
lined with Asian restaurants of every variety, and the sometimes very
ripe aroma of fish from the countless seafood stalls fills the air.
North of Chinatown and centered around Mott and Mulberry streets is
Little Italy — or what’s left of it anyway: The neighborhood, squeezed
by the encroachment of Chinatown, has been reduced to not much more
than a tourist trap, with just a few remaining cafes, stores, and mediocre
restaurants. To the east and north of Little Italy is the Lower East Side, a
historic area that was a Jewish ghetto in the 19th century. The neighbor-
hood is now a bubbling mix of hipster-cool (indie music clubs, adventur-
ous new restaurants) and old-world remnants from its historic past. The
farther east you go, the sketchier the neighborhood can get.
Orchard Street is where you can find great bargain hunting in many old-
world fabric and clothing stores that thrive between club-clothes bou-
tiques and trendy lounges. Keep in mind that the old-world shops close
early on Friday afternoon and remain closed all day on Saturday (the
Jewish Sabbath). The exponentially expanding hipster set can be found
in the blocks between Allen and Clinton streets south of Houston and
north of Delancey, with more new shops, bars, and restaurants popping
up in the blocks to the east every day. The Lower East Side Business
Improvement District operates a neighborhood visitor center at 261
Broome St. (between Orchard and Allen streets; % 866-224-0206 or
212-226-9010); it’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (sometimes later).
Stop in for an Orchard Street Bargain District shopping guide (which
they can also send you in advance), plus other information on this his-
toric ’hood. You can also find shopping, dining, and nightlife directories
online at www.lowereastsideny.com.
Greenwich Village, the East Village, SoHo, and NoHo
SoHo (which stands for south of Houston Street — pronounced how-
ston, not hyoo-ston) is famous for its cast-iron architecture and, for some
time, its thriving art scene. The art scene, however, has mostly vacated;
artists can no longer afford the astronomical rents. Still, SoHo’s cachet is
long-established, and you can find numerous chic boutiques and some
interesting restaurants here. The eastern part of SoHo, rebaptized 
Nolita (north of Little Italy), is where innovative fashion and accessory
designers have opened small shops. The neighborhood has merged
north into NoHo (north of Houston), a small, fashionable area just east
of Broadway and north of Houston Street.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

Greenwich Village, also called simply “the Village,” is a center of art,
dining, shopping, music, and gay life. The neighborhood is roughly bor-
dered by Houston Street to the south and 14th Street to the north.
Known for its architecture, the Village has the shortest street in the city
(Weehawken, just 1 block long) and the narrowest house (on Bedford
Street, where poet Edna St. Vincent Millay once lived). It’s an area that
never sleeps, yet it still manages to give off a sense of quiet and beauty.
Within the Village itself is the West Village, west of Seventh Avenue,
which is the historic center of New York’s gay community and is cen-
tered around Sheridan Square and Christopher Street. It has a residential
feel, with tree-lined streets and comfortable neighborhood cafes. East of
Broadway, the Village becomes the East Village, which draws a younger,
edgier crowd. Still a little less polished despite rising rents, the East
Village still clings proudly to the last remnants of its former seediness.
Some excellent restaurants and boutiques can be found in the East
Village. The area between the East Village and West Village (that is,
between Broadway and Seventh Avenue) is simply referred to as the
Village. In the middle sit New York University and Washington Square
Park, landmarked by the park’s famous arch.
Chelsea, the Flatiron District, and Gramercy Park
Chelsea, which extends from 14th Street to 26th Street and from the
Hudson River to Fifth Avenue, remains one of the city’s largest gay com-
munities. The neighborhood lays claim to lots of art galleries and cafes,
restaurants, and a congregation of high-end, velvet-rope-guarded night-
clubs. East of Chelsea is the Gramercy Park area — a quiet, elegant,
moneyed neighborhood known for its jewel of a park and handsome
architecture. In between are Union Square and the Flatiron District, a
lively hub of New York life that is still home to publishing and Web 2.0
companies. This area, bordered by the historic Flatiron Building to the
north (at Broadway and Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street) and Union Square to
the south, is where members of the fashion industry — models, advertis-
ing people, photographers, and so on — meet and eat.
Midtown
Midtown is roughly defined by 26th Street to the south and 59th Street
to the north. This is concrete canyon territory, where skyscrapers block
out most of the sun and sky. During the day, Midtown is a hectic center
of commerce, seething with people on their way to or from work, while
at night, the restaurant scene is lively and generally very expensive. This
is the city’s biggest hotel neighborhood, with choices running the gamut
from cheap to chic.
Within Midtown to the southeast lies Murray Hill, just east of Fifth
Avenue and below 42nd Street. It’s a mixture of business and residential
property, where a 40-story slab may rub up against a 5-story apartment
building. The Murray Hill area is safe and quiet — for New York. The
Empire State Building is the major sightseeing stop here. Above 42nd
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
78

Street is Midtown East, which is more commercial and includes a
number of famous shops that line 59th Street between Fifth and
Lexington avenues. The main attractions in this area are the United
Nations, Grand Central Terminal, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Rockefeller
Center, and the Chrysler Building. The stretch of Fifth Avenue from Saks
at 49th Street extending to the Plaza Hotel at 59th is home to the city’s
most high-profile, haute shopping, including Tiffany & Co. and Bergdorf
Goodman. Here you can find the city’s finest collection of grand hotels,
mostly along Lexington Avenue and near the park at the top of Fifth.
To the southwest lies the Fashion or Garment District (roughly between
26th and 42nd streets west of Fifth Avenue), with its array of fabric
shops and wholesale fashion stores. At the heart of it, at the intersection
of 34th Street, Broadway, and Sixth Avenue (also called the Avenue of
the Americas), is Herald Square, a bustling (read: choked-with-crowds)
shopping area. Herald Square is the home of Macy’s, and with ongoing
development, more national chain stores are appearing all the time.
Other than that, it’s a pretty grim commercial area that lacks any real
charisma; frankly, I tend to avoid it.
Farther north, on the west side, is Times Square, a once legendary place
full of peep shows and sex shops until a business partnership completed
an ambitious (and completely transforming) improvement campaign.
Times Square is now a family-oriented area with renovated theaters and
the famous neon, which is bigger, brighter, and louder than ever (includ-
ing the largest TV screen in the world, the Sony JumboTron). Crowds are
sometimes impenetrable, so be prepared for a major jostling. Just up
Broadway is the Theater District. The area churns with activity, and the
scale is grand, so it’s not the kind of place to step out for a casual stroll
under the trees (there aren’t any, anyway). Famed Restaurant Row is
close by on 46th Street. A number of hotels are centered around Times
Square, so if you don’t mind the crowds and generally higher prices, and
you want to be as close as possible to the pulse of the city, this is where
you want to be.
Just west of the Theater District is Hell’s Kitchen, probably the most
picturesquely named neighborhood in New York City. Once a rough-and-
tumble immigrant community and the home turf of Irish gangs, Hell’s
Kitchen has seen some gentrification. In an amusing example of New
York’s constant effort to reinvent itself, real-estate developers have
attempted to rename the area “Clinton” or “Theater District West,” but
thankfully, the natives have resisted. Ninth Avenue has blossomed into
one of the city’s finest dining avenues; just stroll along and choose from
a world of great, inexpensive dining options, from American diner to
Mediterranean to traditional Thai.
Uptown
Most of the northern part of the island of Manhattan is comprised of
three major neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 79

The Upper West Side
Located to the west of Central Park, the Upper West Side is bordered by
Columbus Circle, the Time Warner Center, and Lincoln Center to the
south, and Columbia University and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine
to the north. The area is home to some beautiful, historic residential
buildings, such as the Dakota, where John Lennon lived and died, and
the Ansonia, once the home of Babe Ruth. Other streets are lined with
brownstones, town houses, and apartment buildings. In the past decade,
the area has grown tremendously with a proliferation of superstores,
movie theaters, and some very good new restaurants. Also in this neigh-
borhood, you find the American Museum of Natural History. Though it’s
a bit away from the action of Midtown and downtown, the Upper West
Side is a good option for reasonably priced hotels.
The Upper East Side
To the east of Central Park and stretching to the East River, the Upper
East Side’s main draw is Museum Mile, a stretch of Fifth Avenue that
includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Museum
of the City of New York, the International Center of Photography, the
Frick Museum, and the Jewish Museum, all within a walkable stretch.
Madison Avenue from 60th Street well into the 80s is the moneyed crowd’s
main shopping strip. The neighborhood has an upper-crust, old-money
feel and, west of Lexington Avenue, is generally pretty quiet after sundown.
East of Lexington along Third, Second, and First avenues, you encounter
a number of lively (though somewhat bland) restaurants and bars.
Harlem
Harlem stretches from about 96th Street east of Fifth Avenue and 110th
Street west of Fifth Avenue to 155th Street. Spanish Harlem (El Barrio)
runs between East 100th and East 125th streets. Harlem real estate has
shot up the past few years; restaurants, new apartments, and clubs now
line the streets, and historic brownstones are being restored. Exploring
the area has become safer, and that’s a very good thing considering
there’s so much to see here, such as the Morris-Jumel Mansion, the
Schomburg Center, the Studio Museum, and the Apollo Theater. North of
Harlem, you’ll find Washington Heights and Fort Tryon Park, home to
the Cloisters annex of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Finding Information After You Arrive
The following places can help you get your bearings after you arrive in
New York:
 NYC & Company (the former Convention & Visitors Bureau) has 
a Visitor Information Center, 810 Seventh Ave. (between 52nd and
53rd streets; % 212-484-1200; www.nycvisit.com; Open: Mon–Fri
8:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–5 p.m.), where you can find useful
printed material, pick up coupons for theaters and attractions, and
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
80

buy tickets for New York’s top sights, as well as the CityPass (see
Chapter 11).
 The Grand Central Partnership, Grand Central Terminal, East 42nd
Street and Vanderbilt Avenue (www.grandcentralpartnership.
org; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.) offers
an information window inside Grand Central and a cart outside.
 The 34th Street Partnership, Penn Station, Seventh Avenue between
31st and 33rd streets (% 212-719-3434; www.34thstreet.org;
Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), has a
window inside Penn Station and an information cart at the Empire
State Building at Fifth Avenue and 32nd Street. You find carts at
Greeley Square (32nd Street at Broadway and Sixth Avenue) in the
summer and at Madison Square Garden (above Penn Station at
Seventh Avenue and 32nd Street) in above-freezing weather. The
carts open a little later and close a little earlier than the indoor
window.
 The Times Square Visitors Center, 1560 Broadway, on the east side
of the street (between 46th and 47th streets, where Broadway meets
Seventh Avenue; % 212-768-1560; www.timessquarebid.org), is
the city’s top info stop. This pleasant center features a helpful info
desk offering loads of citywide information. You will also find a tour
desk selling tickets for Gray Line bus tours and Circle Line boat tours;
a Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) desk staffed to sell

Getting Around New York
You may not be used to riding a subway, taking a bus, hailing a taxi, or,
yes, walking where you want to go, but that’s what most New Yorkers do.
You’ll find yourself doing the same. The guidelines and tips in this sec-
tion will have you navigating the island of Manhattan like a native in no
time. Remember taxis, subways, and most buses run 24 hours a day.
Traveling by subway
Besides walking, riding the subway is my preferred mode of transport.
And nearly five million people seem to agree with me each day, because
they ride it, too. The subway is quick, inexpensive, and relatively safe
and efficient, as well as being a thoroughly New York experience.
The subway runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The rush-hour crushes
are roughly from 8 to 9:30 a.m. and from 5 to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays; the
trains are relatively uncrowded the rest of the time.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

The subway fare is $2 (half-price for seniors and those with disabilities),
and children under 44 inches tall ride free (up to three per adult).
For more information visit www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/subway.
Finding the entrance and getting onboard
You can easily locate a subway entrance along the sidewalk by looking
for a set of stairs that heads underground. Most stops also have signs
above them that list the lines that run through those stations.
Some subway entrances close at night. Each stairway has a globe on top
of it that’s supposed to tell you whether the entrance is open (green for
open, red for closed), but the globes aren’t always accurate; look down
the stairs to find out whether the entrance is open — a big clue is if
there’s a locked gate at the bottom of the staircase!
The way to gain entry to the subway is with the MetroCard, a magneti-
cally encoded card that debits the fare when swiped through the turn-
stile (or the fare box on any city bus). After you’re in the system, you
can transfer freely to any subway line that you can reach without exiting
your station. MetroCards also allow you free transfers between the bus
and subway within a two-hour period.
MetroCards can be purchased from each station’s staffed token booth
(which is what they’re still called, even though the token itself has been
phased out), where you can only pay with cash. At the ATM-style vend-
ing machines now located in just about every subway station, you can
pay with cash, credit cards, and debit cards. See the “Understanding the
MetroCard” section, later in this chapter, for details.
The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book shows you the pertinent
subway stops, and all the maps in this book also show subway stops.
You can usually find a subway map inside each subway car, on the plat-
form, and on the wall in the subway station. You also can get a detailed
subway map from the token booth inside each station.
Getting where you want to go
If you need directions in the subway, trying to get information from the
token-booth attendant (if one is even present) can be frustrating. The
acoustics are horrible, the people behind you are impatient, and it’s diffi-
cult to make yourself understood. Instead, pick out a friendly or knowl-
edgeable face; you’d be surprised how willing we New Yorkers are to
help out.
The orientation of the subway system is mainly north–south (or uptown–
downtown); you can find only a few points at which the lines go straight
east–west. To travel up and down the West Side (and also to the Bronx
and Brooklyn), take the 1, 2, or 3, line; the A, C, or E line; or the B, D, or 
F line.
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
82

The N, R, Q, and W lines first cut diagonally across town from east to
west and then snake under Seventh Avenue before shooting out to
Queens and Brooklyn.
The crosstown S line, the Shuttle, runs between Times Square and Grand
Central Terminal. The 7 line also goes from Times Square to Grand Central
(with a stop at Fifth Avenue). Farther downtown, across 14th Street, the
L line works its own crosstown magic.
Lines have assigned colors on subway maps and trains — red for the 1,
2, and 3 trains; green for the 4, 5, and 6 trains; and so on — but nobody
ever refers to them by color. Always refer to them by number or letter
when asking questions. Within Manhattan, the distinction between dif-
ferent numbered trains that share the same line is usually that some are
express and others are local.
Express trains often skip about three stops for each one that they make;
express stops are indicated on subway maps with a white (rather than a
solid) circle. Local stops usually come about 9 blocks apart.
Directions are almost always indicated using “Uptown” (northbound)
and “Downtown” (southbound), so be sure to know what direction you
want to head in. The outsides of some subway entrances are marked
UPTOWN ONLY or DOWNTOWN ONLY; read carefully, because it’s easy to head
in the wrong direction. After you’re on the platform, check the signs
overhead to make sure that the train you’re waiting for is traveling in 
the right direction. If you do make a mistake and get on the wrong train,
it’s a good idea to wait for an express station, like 14th Street or 42nd
Street, so you can get off and change for the other direction without
paying again.
Staying safe
To keep yourself safe in the subway, heed this advice:
 At night, use the off-hours waiting areas, which are usually close to
the exits to the street. They’re clearly marked with signs overhead.
 Don’t tempt thieves by displaying money or valuables (including
iPods, cellphones, or laptops) on the subway.
 Don’t try to stop a subway door that’s closing. You can end up with
a bruised hand or foot — or something more serious. Just wait for
the next train.
 Always stand a few feet back from the tracks on the subway plat-
form. People have survived a fall, but believe me when I say that
you do not want to try your luck.
 Avoid subways late at night, and splurge on a cab after about 10 or
11 p.m. — it’s money well spent to avoid a long wait on a deserted
platform. Or take the bus.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

Traveling by bus
The New York City bus system reaches far and wide, traveling to just
about all points of the city on a north–south and an east–west grid. You
even get a tour of the city as you ride (the M5 down Fifth Avenue from
Central Park to Greenwich Village is a personal fave). Remember that
because traffic can be horrific during the day, buses are much slower
going than the subway. Also, avoid buses during rush hour if you have
luggage or lots of shopping bags in hand.
To check out the bus routes, grab one of the free city bus maps available
by the front door of every bus and in the booths at subway stations. If
you want to scan the routes before you get to town, you can access full
bus maps via the Internet at www.mta.nyc.ny.us/busco.
Bus stops are located every couple of blocks along each route. The stop
is either a small, glass-walled shelter or a simple sign on a post (blue
with a bus icon) stating the bus numbers. Each bus has a sign above the
windshield that flashes its route and end destination. Schedules for
buses are posted at most bus stops and are relatively reliable. The buses
run every 5 to 20 minutes or so, depending on the time of day.
Some buses are labeled LIMITED and make only a few major stops along
the line; they’re particularly useful when you want to go a long distance.
These express buses are designated only by an orange LIMITED sign
placed on the dashboard to the right of the driver. Limited bus stops
also display the orange sign.
Local bus fare is $2 ($5 for express buses) — half-price for seniors and
riders with disabilities, free for lap-sitting infants and children under 44
inches (up to three per adult). A seven-day express bus pass costs $41.
The fare is payable with a MetroCard or exact change. Bus drivers don’t
make change, and fare boxes don’t accept dollar bills or pennies. You
can’t purchase MetroCards on the bus, so you have to have them before
you board.
If you pay with a MetroCard, you can transfer to another bus or to the
subway for free within two hours. If you pay cash, you must request a
free transfer slip that allows you to change to an intersecting bus route
only (legal transfer points are listed on the transfer paper) within one
hour of issue. Transfer slips cannot be used to enter the subway.
All buses in Manhattan, and 95 percent of New York City buses in the
other boroughs, are equipped with wheelchair lifts and special areas
where the seats in the back fold up to make room for securing wheel-
chairs onboard. The buses also “kneel,” scrunching down when they
stop so that the first step is not quite so high up.
The Alliance for Downtown New York’s Downtown Connection offers a
free bus service that provides access to important downtown destina-
tions including Battery Park City, the World Financial Center, and South
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
84

Street Seaport. The service, which operates from 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
seven days a week, brings lower Manhattan residents, workers, and visi-
tors closer to downtown businesses, events, shopping, and attractions.
The Downtown Connection’s 5-mile route runs in two directions: from
Chambers Street on the West Side to Beekman Street on the East Side.
The service makes stops at dozens of locations and is able to transport
about 30 passengers per bus (20 seats and 10 standees). Six buses run
on weekdays and four buses run on the weekend.
The climate-controlled buses are ADA wheelchair accessible and run on
ultra-low-sulfur fuel. Each vehicle is also equipped with diesel-particu-
late filters and electronically controlled fuel-injected engines. For more
information on the Downtown Connection, call the Downtown Alliance
at % 212-566-6700, or visit www.downtownny.com.
Understanding the MetroCard
The MetroCard fare card is a high-tech system that encodes a certain
number of rides on a magnetic strip on the back of a thin plastic card.
MetroCards are accepted on both buses and subways and have a lot of
advantages over the old tokens: They don’t weigh a ton, you can slip the
card in your wallet or pocket, you can buy and recharge it in an auto-
matic vending machine, you get a free ride for every $7 you spend, and
last but not least, you get one free transfer between bus and subway (or
vice versa) for each ride as long as you make the transfer within two
hours of your initial boarding.
Two types of MetroCards are available for purchase:
 Pay-Per-Ride is the regular card I just described, which can be
used for up to four people by swiping up to four times (bring the
whole family). You can put any amount from $4 (two rides) to $80
on your card. Every time you put at least $7 on your Pay-Per-Ride
MetroCard, it’s automatically credited with an additional 15 per-
cent. (The minimum amount to avoid any leftover balance is $40,
which gets you 23 rides.) You can refill your card at any subway
station at any time until its expiration date, which is usually about
a year from the date of purchase.
 Unlimited-Ride can’t be used for more than one person at a time or
more frequently than 18-minute intervals. These cards are available
in four values: the Daily Fun Pass, which allows you a day’s worth
of unlimited subway and bus rides for $7.50; the 7-Day MetroCard,
for $25; the 14-Day MetroCard, for $47; and the 30-Day MetroCard,
for $81. Seven- and 30-day Unlimited-Ride MetroCards can be pur-
chased at any subway station or MetroCard merchant.
Fun Passes can’t be purchased at token booths — buy them at a
MetroCard vending machine, from a MetroCard merchant, or at the
MTA desk at the Times Square Information Center.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

Unlimited-Ride MetroCards go into effect the first time you use 
them — so if you buy a card on Monday and don’t use it until
Wednesday, Wednesday is when the clock starts ticking. A Fun Pass
is good from the first time you use it until 3 a.m. the next day, while
7- and 30-day MetroCards run out at midnight on the last day.
These unlimited MetroCards can’t be refilled; throw them out after
they’ve been used up and buy a new one.
In addition to being sold in the subway, MetroCards are sold at many
hotels and in thousands of shops all over town. If a shop offers the card,
it has a sign in its window saying so.
The MetroCard has one corner snipped off and a small hole on one side.
To use your MetroCard in the subway, swipe the card forward through
the reader, with the cut-off corner on top and at the back (and between
your fingers) and the little hole leading the way. To use your MetroCard
on the bus, insert the card downward into the machine with the snipped-
off corner up and to the left, the little hole on the bottom and the side
with the magnetic strip facing you. The machine eats the card momen-
tarily and then spits it back out and beeps — also displaying how much
money is left on your card.
Seniors and people with disabilities get a 50 percent discount from the
MTA. You can apply for the discount by writing to Customer Assistance
Division, MTA, 2 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10004. Or you can
download the application at www.mta.info, or call % 718-243-4999.
You can recharge your discounted MetroCard at the vending machines
and ticket booths in subway stations.
Traveling by taxi
There are times when I have to break down, open my wallet, and get into
a taxi. Like when I’m late, it’s not rush hour, and I need to be somewhere
fast. Or when I’m not near public transportation, if I’m with a group of
three or four, or if it’s just too late at night and I want to be home safe
and fast.
Taking a cab costs you $2.50 for the initial charge, plus 40¢ per 1⁄5 mile 
or 40¢ per 120 seconds waiting charge, plus a 50¢ night surcharge 
(8 p.m.–6 a.m.) and a $1 surcharge between 4 and 8 p.m. The average
fare in Manhattan is $7.
When you’re waiting on the street for an available taxi, look at the
medallion light on the top of oncoming cabs. If the light is out, the taxi
is in use. When the center part (the number) is lit, the taxi is available —
this is when you raise your hand to flag the cab. (Observe flagging eti-
quette and put a respectful distance between you and any fellow flag-
gers; don’t steal someone else’s cab.) If all the lights are on, the driver is
off duty. A taxi can’t take more than four people, so expect to split up if
your group is larger. If it’s raining or it’s rush hour and everyone is look-
ing for a cab, either be prepared to battle it out among the seasoned
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
86

(read: “ruthless”) New York cab riders, or just head for the nearest
subway station.
Follow these suggestions to make your ride as smooth as possible:
 Plant yourself in the backseat and then indicate your destination.
Once you’re in the cab, a driver cannot refuse to take you anyplace
in the five boroughs (and unscrupulous drivers sometimes will do
that, for destinations they fear are unsafe such as Harlem or too
out of their way, such as Brooklyn or Queens). When announcing
your destination to the driver, speak clearly. Remember that
English is probably not your driver’s first language.
 Try to know the cross-street of your destination (“Third Avenue
and 41st Street”). Many drivers don’t know the city as well as they
ought to (especially outside of central Manhattan), and if you give a
specific street address (like “1500 Broadway”), the driver may not
immediately know the exact location, and his confusion may end
up costing you more money.
 If your driver is driving too fast for you, ask him nicely to slow
down. You can also ask him to get off of his cellphone, even if it’s
hands-free. You have the right to a safe (as well as a smoke-free 
and noise-free) trip.
 When you get to your destination, have your money or credit
card ready. You can track the charge on the meter; remember to
add the 50¢ night surcharge and the $1 4-to-8 p.m. surcharge). You
want to disembark rapidly to avoid traffic jams.
 Have small bills with you; drivers generally don’t accept bills
larger than $20. You can also pay with a credit or debit card — 
all taxicabs are required by law to accept them (and you should
report the driver if he claims his card machine is broken).
 Tip 15 percent (though, know that it is within your rights to
decline to tip for poor service).
 Ask for a receipt. The receipt has the taxi medallion number on 
it, which is a useful detail if you forget something in the car. If you
leave anything behind in the cab or if you want to register a com-
plaint, call the Taxi and Limousine Commission Consumer Hotline
(% 212-692-8294) and reference the medallion number to help
identify your driver.
 Check that you have all your belongings before leaving. Taxi driv-
ers are usually very honest, but the same is not necessarily true of
the customers who use the cab immediately after you.
 Disembark from the curbside door to avoid the stream of traffic
that is dodging around your stopped vehicle on the other side.
 Wear a seat belt. Accidents do happen.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

Seeing New York on Foot
Walking is one of the preferred modes of transportation in New York —
it’s certainly mine. Walking not only lets you take in the wonder that is
New York, it’s also good exercise. And best of all: It’s free.
When walking in New York, however, don’t do as we New Yorkers do. We
zigzag across the streets, rush against the lights, dodge taxis and buses,
and tempt fate on an almost daily basis. So be smart and exercise some
caution. Always be careful when crossing the street, even when you
have the light; drivers sometimes get distracted. And cross only at
crosswalks. Keep your eyes open for distracted walkers who sometimes
resemble NFL blockers. And if you’re gawking at some amazing edifice,
do it standing still. Otherwise you may find yourself flattened by one of
those blockers. Walk as if you’re driving, staying to the right.
Unfortunately, many bicyclists seem to think that the traffic laws don’t
apply to them; they often blithely fly through red lights and dash the
wrong way on one-way streets, so be on your guard. Be extra cautious in
bike-messenger-heavy areas such as Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron District;
I’ve been nearly sideswiped here many times.
Walking is sometimes faster than taking the bus and sometimes even
taking a taxi. Traffic can move through Midtown at a snail’s pace — 
especially during rush hours — and pedestrians typically outdistance
cars and buses by blocks.
Be sure to bring comfortable shoes! You’ll not only be on your feet seeing
the city all day, but you’ll probably be on your feet indoors, too — you
can rack up a lot of mileage inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for
example.

New York City’s Best Hotels
In This Chapter

 Arriving without a reservation
 Deciding among New York’s best hotels
 Choosing a backup if your favorite isn’t available
W
ith more than 72,000 hotel rooms, the sleeping options in New
York are staggering. Do you want to spend most of your travel
budget on a luxurious hotel? Do you want to stay close to the neon and
noise of Times Square? Do you want a room with a view of Central Park?
Do you want a room bigger than your linen closet back home? These are
some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you book a room.
Getting to Know Your Options
In some cities and regions, chain hotels may be the most prevalent
option, but that’s not the case in New York City. In this section, I briefly
discuss nationally known chains as well as one-of-a-kind hostelries and
bed-and-breakfasts you can find only in New York.
Independent hotels
Many of the hotels I list in this chapter fall in the class of “independent”
hotels (versus chains) because I feel such hotels give you more of a taste
of the city. Don’t be misled, though; in New York, independent hotels
include everything from huge hotels run by large corporations — or by
the master builder, Donald Trump — to small boutique hotels that are
family-owned and run the gamut from very expensive to inexpensive.
Chain hotels
Just a few of the hotels I list are major national chains. Far from the kind
of cookie-cutter sameness you may find elsewhere, the chains I choose,

usually moderate in price, hold up well in comparison to similarly
located independent hotels. (See the Quick Concierge for the toll-free
numbers and Web sites of New York’s major chain hotels.)
Bed-and-breakfasts and inns
New York is not the Berkshires, where there are B&Bs galore. Still, the
city has some nice B&Bs and inns (frequently in historic brownstones in
residential neighborhoods) that offer quaint alternatives to the big, cold
behemoth of a hotel the city is more famous for. If you’d like to check
out B&B options, try these associations and reservation agencies:

someone’s place as an alternative to staying in a hotel, which can be a
money-saving option if you’re traveling with your family or staying more
than several days, try the following companies:

Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. The most competitive rates may be found on the Internet.
Or, a travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with certain
hotels than you can find on your own. (That’s because the hotel often
gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his business toward
that hotel.)
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. The best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surprisingly simple:
Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised.
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
90

Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy rates
rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are subject to
change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different
from the actual rate you receive when you make your reservation.
As you proceed with the selection process, don’t forget that the basic
rate a hotel charges you isn’t what you end up paying. The hotel tax in
New York City is 13.375 percent, and don’t forget the room charge of
$3.50 per night. When you reserve a room, make sure to find out
whether the price you’re being quoted includes taxes. (The prices listed
in this chapter do not include taxes.)
You don’t have to just take the room and rate that a hotel offers you. With
a little know-how, you can get the room you want at a price you can afford.
In the following sections, I offer some tried-and-true tips to help you
locate the best room for the best available price.
Trying out a travel agent
Hotels sometimes have discount rates that they offer only to that dying
breed: the travel agent. You can often find the same discount by booking
online, but then you have to do the work. So if you’re shy about bargain-
ing or don’t have the time to comparison-shop, an agent may be better
equipped to negotiate discounts for you.
Taking the do-it-yourself approach
The following tips can help you save money on your room if you decide
to do the legwork yourself:
 Ask for the best rate. Sometimes the easiest approach is a straight-
forward one. A hotel typically won’t extend its discount room rates
unless you ask for them. Find out if the hotel is offering specials or
discounted packages.
 Mention your memberships. When you reserve a room, mention
your membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and any
other corporate rewards programs you belong to. These member-
ships may shave a few dollars off your room rate.
 Call all available numbers. Many hotels have both a direct local
number and a toll-free number for their major chain or hotel
group’s central reservations desk. Sometimes these numbers have
different rate information. Call both numbers and compare the
rates that each one gives you.
Choosing your season carefully
Room rates can vary dramatically — by hundreds of dollars in some
cases — depending on what time of year you visit. The dead of winter
(Jan–Mar) is best for bargains in New York; summer is pricier but not
stratospheric. Fall is the busiest and most expensive season, running
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York City’s Best Hotels 91

from September right up through the end-of-the-year holidays; expect to
pay top dollar for everything, especially at Christmastime. See Chapter 3
for more information on the best time to visit the city.
Going uptown or downtown . . . or to Brooklyn?
A New York subway can whisk you anywhere you want to go in minutes,
so you don’t have to stay in Midtown or the Upper East Side, where the
most expensive hotels are. You get better value for your money by stay-
ing outside the Theater District, in the residential neighborhoods such as
Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Murray Hill, or the Upper West Side.
Chances are that a Manhattan-based hotel is the only kind you’re consid-
ering; that’s understandable, especially if you have only a few days.
However, believe it or not (and this Brooklynite is still in shock), hotels
are popping up in downtown Brooklyn at a fierce rate. The Downtown
Brooklyn Partnership, a nonprofit organization overseeing Brooklyn’s
booming development, counts nine new hotels with more than 1,800
rooms combined set to open in 2009 and 2010. The hotels include major
chains such as Sheraton Four Points, Hilton Garden Inn, Holiday Inn, and
Homewood Suites. If you have friends or family in Brooklyn, a hotel
there may be a great option for you. But if not, keep it in mind as a possi-
ble alternative if you can’t find a room in your price range in Manhattan;
downtown Brooklyn is also just a quick subway (or cab) ride away.
Visiting over a weekend
If your trip includes a weekend, you may be able to save big. Business
hotels tend to empty out on weekends, and rooms that go for a pretty
penny Monday through Thursday can drop prices dramatically, as low
as $200 or less, after the execs have headed home. These deals are espe-
cially prevalent in the Financial District, but they’re often available in
tourist-friendly Midtown, too. Check the hotel’s Web site for attractive
weekend rates, or ask when you call to reserve.
Buying a money-saving package deal
A travel package that includes your plane tickets and your hotel stay 
for one price just may be the best bargain of all. In some cases, you get
airfare, accommodations, transportation to and from the airport, plus
extras like a sightseeing tour or discount coupons to shows or restau-
rants. All this may be less than the hotel alone would have cost had you
booked it yourself. (See Chapter 5 for more information.)
Avoid excess charges and hidden costs
Use your own cellphone, pay phones, or prepaid phone cards instead of
dialing direct from hotel phones, which usually have exorbitant rates.
Don’t be tempted by the room’s minibar offerings: Most hotels charge
through the nose for water, soda, and snacks. If a hotel insists upon tack-
ing on a surprise “energy surcharge” that wasn’t mentioned at check-in
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
92

or an extra fee for amenities you didn’t use, you can often make a case
for getting it removed.
Investigating reservation services
These outfits usually work as consolidators, buying up or reserving
rooms in bulk, and then dealing them out to customers at a profit. You
can get 10 percent to 50 percent off; but remember, these discounts
apply to rack rates — inflated prices that people rarely end up paying
anyway. You may get a decent rate, but always call the hotel directly to
see if you can do better. (See later in this chapter for more information.)
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Hotels often offer “Internet only” deals that can save you 10 percent to
20 percent over what you’d pay if you booked over the telephone. Also,
hotels often advertise all their available deals on their Web sites, so you
don’t have to rely on a reservation agent to fill you in. What’s more,
some of the discount reservations agencies (including those listed in
this section) have sites that allow you to book online.
Consider joining the Playbill Online Theater Club (www.playbillclub.
com), a free service that offers some excellent members-only rates at
select city hotels, in addition to discounts on theater tickets. American
Automobile Association (AAA) members can often score the best dis-
counts by booking at www.aaa.com.
Travel search sites such as Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Expedia (www.
expedia.com), Priceline (www.priceline.com), Hotwire (www.hotwire.
com), and Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) offer other discount
options. Shop around. And if you have special needs — a quiet room, a
room with a view — call the hotel directly and make your needs known
after you’ve booked online.
Travel search sites compete for the business of millions of consumers
surfing for accommodations around the world. This competitiveness can
be a boon to consumers who have the patience and time to shop and
compare the online sites for good deals — but shop you must, because
prices can vary considerably from site to site. And keep in mind that
hotels at the top of a site’s listing may be there for no other reason than
that they paid money to get the placement.
Priceline’s booking process allows you to select which neighborhood
you want to stay in; start with downtown, the Upper East Side, and the
Upper West Side with your lowest bids.
On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least desirable
rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingForTravel Web site (www.bidding
fortravel.com) before bidding on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date
list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For Priceline, you pay
upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not provide

loyalty-program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities when
you book a room through independent online services.
HotelChatter.com is a daily webzine offering smart coverage and critiques
of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor.com or HotelShark.com for help-
ful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort properties.
Always get a confirmation number and make a printout of any online
booking transaction.
Finding the top-notch room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room; they’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always
cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room away
from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of the restau-
rants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise.
Street noise in New York can be deafening, but many hotels have double-
pane or soundproof windows. If you’re a light sleeper, ask whether the
room you’ve booked is facing the street or off the street. And if you
aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. If
they have another room, they should be happy to accommodate you,
within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation 
(Not Recommended)
Your lodging options are limited if you arrive without a reservation.
Hotel occupancy rates in the city have hovered around 85 percent for
the past couple of years. However, making a few phone calls can get you
a room most of the time.
As with airline travel, services that call themselves consolidators or
wholesalers purchase lots of rooms at a big discount and then pass
some of the savings on to you. The hotel stays full, the consolidator
makes money, and you may save a lot (or only a little) in the bargain.
Money aside, consolidator and reservation services often can get you a
room when you can’t find one anywhere else. The service usually makes
you pay for your stay upfront; however, you’ve gotta pay sometime, and
this way, the figure may be more like what you had in mind.
If you arrive in New York without a reservation and have trouble booking
directly with the hotels, then try the following bureaus:
 Quikbook (% 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com): The first place
to try, it’s particularly good for New York City hotels.
Part III: Settling Into New York City

 Turbotrip.com (% 800-473-7829; www.turbotrip.com): Provides
comprehensive lodging and travel information for destinations
throughout the United States and worldwide.
 Hotel Discount (% 800-715-7666; www.hoteldiscount.com):
Another good source for last-minute reservations.
New York City’s Best Hotels
Hotel rates in New York are the most expensive in the United States. In
2006, the average price of a hotel room was close to $270 per night, and
in 2007, it soared closer to the $300 mark. And not only are you paying
more for your room, but you’re getting less than you would in other
cities. Here is a breakdown of what sort of space and amenities you can
expect at each price level.
Getting what you pay for: Picking a price range
Each hotel listing is prefaced with a number of dollar signs ranging from
one ($) to five ($$$$$), corresponding to price. This is roughly what you
can expect in terms of room size and standard amenities in each of these
price categories:
 $ ($109–$209): These hotels are true bargains, but services are
sparse. Your room will probably be small, you may have to share a
bathroom, and don’t expect room service, fitness equipment,
movie or cable channels, or bellhops.
 $$ ($210–$309): Expect these rooms to be a little larger and of
better quality and comfort than those in the first category. You may
have access to a fitness center and business facilities, and the hotel
may throw in a complimentary continental breakfast and/or free
Internet service.
 $$$ ($310–$449): Typically, you get room service, a phone with a
dataport, probably a refrigerator and perhaps a kitchenette or
kitchen, cable TV and/or DVD, free access to a health club, wireless
Internet, complimentary breakfast or beverages (and possibly after-
noon wine and cheese), and an on-site restaurant.
 $$$$ ($450–$600): On top of the amenities listed for the preceding
category, you can expect plenty of space, fine furnishings, a variety
of dining and drinking options in the hotel, and excellent service.
Because these hotels often cater to businesspeople, they some-
times offer special amenities like complimentary car service to the
Financial District.
 $$$$$ ($600 and up): In this range, you get more than a place to
stay: You get an experience. These hotels have style, elegance, and
a reputation for impeccable service.

Midtown East
Located a bit away from the center of Midtown, but still within easy walk-
ing distance of Herald Square, the Empire State Building, Madison Square
Garden, and Grand Central, this may be New York’s only fitness-suite hotel.
When you book a room, you can request a “Fit Kit” that will be prepared,
with no extra charge, to be used if you only have time to work out in your
room. The hotel also has a complete fitness spa with the weights, cardio
equipment, and massage and skin treatments. But even if you don’t want
to break a sweat during your stay, the hotel features amenities that make
it a very attractive option, including a full kitchen, at least one 27-inch tele-
vision, a large desk with an ergonomic chair, the “Affinia Bed” with a
custom-designed mattress, six-selection “pillow menu,” and a minibar
stocked with unusual options, such as health elixirs.
See map p. 98. 150 E. 34th St. (between Second and Third avenues, 3 blocks east of
the Empire State Building). % 212-481-7600. Fax: 212-889-8856. www.affinia.com.

The Algonquin
$$$
Midtown West
The atmosphere in this 1902 landmark building is so steeped in writers’
lore that you’ll feel guilty turning on the television instead of reading the
latest issue of the New Yorker provided in each of the guest rooms. Rooms
can be cramped, but they’re equipped with possibly the most comfort-
able, inviting beds in the city as well as 21st-century technology such as
Wi-Fi, flatscreen televisions, and iPods loaded with audiobooks. If you have
a tendency toward claustrophobia, head to the plush lobby where you can
sit in cushy chairs, sip exquisite (and expensive) cocktails, have a snack,
or just read or play on your laptop. Meals are served in the celebrated
Round Table Room, while the fabulous Oak Room is one of the city’s top
cabarets. The publike Blue Bar is home to a rotating collection of Al
Hirschfeld drawings that’s well worth a browse.
See map p. 98. 59 W. 44th St. (between Fifth and Sixth avenues, 1 block from Times
Square). % 888-304-2047 or 212-840-6800. Fax: 212-944-1618. www.algonquin

The Benjamin
$$$$
Midtown East
From the Jazz Age design of the exterior and lobby, you would never know
that the Benjamin is only a decade old. But after you check into your spa-
cious room and notice the high-tech amenities, such as a combo
printer/fax/copier, high-speed Internet access, and an ergonomic chair at
an executive desk with movable workstation, you’ll know you’re in the 21st
century. Many of the amenities are geared toward business travelers, but

there are luxurious touches anyone can appreciate. All rooms are airy, but
the deluxe studio and one-bedroom suites are extra large. The hotel even
offers a few one-bedroom suites with terraces. Lexington Avenue can get
very busy most weeknights and mornings, so if you’re a light sleeper, book
a room off Lexington. Or call the “sleep concierge,” who consults with you
and recommends the right choice from a pillow menu to help you sleep.
Bathrooms feature Frette robes and shower water pressure that’s strong
enough to make you think you’ve just experienced a deep-tissue massage.

The Carlton on Madison Avenue
$$$
Flatiron District
This 1904 Beaux Arts hotel was getting worn around the edges when it was
rescued by architect David Rockwell and magnificently refurbished. The
highlight of that $60-million renovation is the grand, sweeping lobby com-
plete with a marble curving staircase and a cathedral-like high ceiling. The
Carlton has recaptured the glory of the past and blended it with contem-
porary furnishings in the lobby along with a two-story waterfall. Rooms
are generously sized and retain the Beaux Arts motif with the addition of
modern amenities such as Frette linens, Wi-Fi Internet, and iPod clock
radios. The marble bathrooms offer plenty of counter space; some rooms
have bathtubs while others just have showers. Off the lobby is the

The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel
$$$$$
Upper East Side
This 34-story grande dame towers over Madison Avenue, epitomizing the
old-world, moneyed neighborhood where it stands. Service is white-glove
(literally) and doormen wear bowler hats; the many celebrities or digni-
taries, some with faces obscured by silk scarves, sip tea in the hotel’s cozy
Gallery. Guest rooms range from singles to seven-room suites, some with
terraces and full dining rooms. All have marble bathrooms with whirlpool
tubs and all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber; even
your pet is served Fiji water. Many suites have breathtaking views of either
downtown or the West Side and Central Park. The Carlyle is also the home
of Bemelmans Bar, the gorgeously redesigned Café Carlyle for great
cabaret, and the elegant Carlyle Restaurant.

Casablanca Hotel
$$$
Midtown West
Try to picture the exotic, romantic setting of the movie Casablanca — 
ceiling fans, mosaic tiles, and North African–themed art — and then try to
picture that setting in the heart of neon-blinding, cacophonous Times
Square. The combination seems unlikely, but really, who wouldn’t want a
desert oasis in the middle of all that mayhem? And that’s what the
Casablanca Hotel really is: a calming refuge where you can escape from
the noise and crowds. The recently renovated (and soundproofed) rooms
may not be the biggest around, but they’re well-outfitted with the afore-
mentioned ceiling fans, DVD players, complimentary high-speed Internet
access, and beautifully tiled bathrooms where, if you want, you can open
the window and let sounds outside remind you where you really are.
Because of its location, moderate prices, size (only 48 rooms), and acco-
lades, the Casablanca is in high demand, so book early.

Chelsea Lodge
$
Chelsea
Not only is this small hotel in a Chelsea brownstone a charmer, but it’s also
a great value for those on a budget. Though the rooms are small, they’re fur-
nished in an appealing old-fashioned Americana style and everything is in
top-notch condition. Rooms on the first floor have high ceilings and give the
appearance of being bigger. Beds are full-size and each room has its own sink
and in-room shower stall; toilets are shared. I like the location in the heart of
trendy, yet residential Chelsea, and coupled with the stylishness of the
rooms, you’d be hard-pressed to do better for the money. It’s best for couples
rather than shares. Tip: If you have a little more room in your budget, suites
are available a few doors down; the $229 price reflects the upgrade in ameni-
ties (including queen-size beds, private bathrooms, and free Wi-Fi).

furniture includes a work desk and an armoire; other amenities include
free Wi-Fi, ceiling fans and air-conditioning, and satellite TV. Beds are
comfy, and sheets and towels are of good quality. Rooms are small but
make the most of the limited space, and the place is pristine. The TriBeCa
location is safe, hip, and subway-convenient. Don’t expect much in the way
of services; if you want food, call in for delivery, and plan to get your coffee
from the store around the corner. But this is still a fine choice for the
money (though, like the rest of New York, it’s more expensive than it used
to be).

Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square
$$$
Midtown West
In the heart of ear-splitting, eye-blinding Times Square, this 45-story
Doubletree is a wonderland for children. From the fresh-baked chocolate-
chip cookies you get upon arrival, the spacious suites big enough for two
preschoolers to play hide-and-seek, and the all-day children’s room-serv-
ice menu, to the proximity to the gargantuan Toys “R” Us, American Girl
Place, Build-a-Bear Workshop, and other kid-friendly Times Square offer-
ings, this Doubletree is hard to beat for families. Bathrooms have two
entrances, so the kids don’t have to traipse through the parent’s room,
and every suite has two televisions with on-demand video games.

Gershwin Hotel
$$
Flatiron District
This creative-minded, Warhol-esque hotel caters to up-and-coming artis-
tic types — and well-established names with an eye for value — with its
bold modern-art collection and wild style. The standard rooms are clean
and bright, with Picasso-style wall murals and Philippe Starck–ish takes
on motel furnishings. Superior rooms are better and well-worth the extra
money; all have either a queen-size bed, two twins, or two doubles, plus a
private bathroom with cute, colorful tile. If you’re bringing the brood, the
Family & Friends rooms are the best option. Budget travelers willing to
bunk should consider the Auberge rooms ($40). The hotel is more serv-
ice-oriented than you usually see at this price level (laundry service and
baby-sitting are even available), and the staff is very professional.

Hotel Beacon
$$
Upper West Side
Okay, so you’re not in Times Square or in trendy SoHo, but when you’re at
the Hotel Beacon, you’re on the Upper West Side, and for families, you
won’t find a better location — or value. Close to Central Park and Riverside
Park, the Museum of Natural History and Lincoln Center, and major
subway lines, it’s not like the Beacon is in a desolate spot. Rooms here are
generously sized and feature a kitchenette, a roomy closet, and a marble
bathroom. Nearly all standard rooms feature two double beds, and they’re
big enough to sleep a family on a budget. The large one- and two-bedroom
suites are decent deals; each has two closets and a pullout sofa in the well-
furnished living room. The two-bedrooms have a second bathroom,
making them well outfitted enough to house a small army. There’s no room
service, but a wealth of good budget dining options that deliver, along with
excellent markets nearby such as Fairway, make the Beacon even more of
a home away from home.

Hotel Elysée
$$$
Midtown East
This romantic gem in the heart of Midtown may be easy to miss; it’s
dwarfed by the glass towers on either side of it. But the fact that it’s so
inconspicuous is part of the Elysée’s romantic appeal. Built in 1926, the
hotel has a storied past as the preferred address for artists and writers.
The hotel still retains a sexy, discreet feel and is run expertly by HK Hotels
(the Casablanca, the Gansevoort, and the Library). The renovated rooms
have many quirky features; some have fireplaces, others have kitchens or
solariums, and all are decorated in French-country furnishings. Good-sized
bathrooms are done up in Italian marble and well outfitted. On the second
floor is the Club Room, where a free continental breakfast is offered daily
along with complimentary wine and cheese on weekday evenings. The hotel
also provides daily passes to a nearby branch of the New York Sports Club.

Hotel Gansevoort

Meatpacking District
Built from the ground up by hotelier Henry Kallan (of the Casablanca,

first major hotel in the transformed Meatpacking District. This sleek, 
Part III: Settling Into New York City

14-floor, zinc-colored tower, with its clubby lobby and the indoor/outdoor
rooftop bar and pool, is the symbolic anchor of the district. Despite its
trendiness, the Gansevoort offers, as do all the HK hotels, excellent, per-
sonable service. Rooms are good-sized with comfortable furnishings in
soft tones and amenities such as Nintendo Wii and wireless Internet; and
some have small balconies and bay windows with seating nooks. Suites
have Hudson River views. The generously sized bathrooms are done up in
ceramic, stainless steel, and marble and impeccably appointed. You’ll find
original art by New York artists on display in all the guest rooms and
throughout the hotel.

Hotel Giraffe
$$$$
Flatiron District
This hotel, in the fashionable Madison Park area, has a cozy, intimate, feel
to it. Guest rooms evoke an urban European character with high ceilings,
velveteen upholstered chairs, and original black-and-white photographs
from the ’20s and ’30s. All the rooms are good-sized with high ceilings, and
deluxe rooms and suites feature French doors that lead to small balconies
with large windows and remote-controlled blackout shades. Bathrooms
are spacious with plenty of marble counter space and glass-paneled doors.
But the services — characteristic of the HK Hotels group — are what sep-
arate this place from many others: complimentary continental breakfast
each morning; wine and cheese in the evenings; and coffee, cookies, and
tea all day; plus free passes to the New York Sports Club. The lovely
rooftop garden is the perfect place for a glass of wine in the evening or
morning coffee during warm weather.

Hotel Metro

Midtown West
With its Art Deco style, decent-size rooms, and plenty of free amenities,
the Metro, just a block from the Empire State Building, is one of
Manhattan’s better values. The recently renovated rooms are outfitted
with modern furnishings in earth tones, and include iPod docking stations
and laptop-size safes. Though on the small side, the marble bathrooms are
lovely and have shower stalls big enough for two. The two-room family
suite has a second bedroom in lieu of a sitting area; small families on
tighter budgets can opt for a roomy double/double. The comfy, fire-lit
library/lounge area off the lobby — where complimentary buffet breakfast
is laid out and the coffeepot’s on all day — is a popular hangout. The

Hotel Newton

Upper West Side
On the burgeoning northern extreme of the Upper West Side, the Newton
is a budget hotel that seems to be a notch above in almost every category.
The lobby is small but tasteful, and the rooms are generally large, with
good, firm beds, a work desk, free Wi-Fi, and a sizable bathroom, plus
roomy closets in most. Some rooms are big enough to accommodate fami-
lies with two doubles or two queen-size beds. The suites feature two
queen-size beds in the bedroom, a sofa in the sitting room, plus niceties
like a microwave, minifridge, and iron, making them well worth the few
extra dollars. This AAA-approved, smoke-free hotel is impeccably kept.
The 96th Street express subway stop is a block away, providing conven-
ient access to the rest of the city, and the Key West Diner next door is a
favorite for huge, cheap breakfasts.

The Hotel on Rivington
$$$$
Lower East Side
The contrast of a 21-story glass tower luxury hotel in the midst of 19th-
and early-20th-century Lower East Side low-rise tenement buildings is
striking, but an accurate representation of what that neighborhood has
become. You may not be close to the center of Manhattan if you stay at
the Hotel on Rivington, but you will be in an almost painfully trendy loca-
tion. From the floor-to-ceiling windows of some rooms, furnished with
modern amenities such as flatscreen televisions, huge Japanese soaking
tubs in the bathrooms, and tempur-pedic mattresses on the beds, you
have incredible city views. (If the view matters, ask for a high floor and be
prepared to pay extra for it; the best view you get from other lower-floor
rooms is the back of a neighboring building.) A majority of the rooms have
private terraces, the option of in-room spa services, and heated, tiled
floors in the large bathrooms. Room service is provided by the hotel’s
ultra-trendy restaurant THOR.

Hôtel Plaza Athénée
$$$$$
Upper East Side
If money is no object and you don’t want to stray too far from Madison
Avenue shopping, this elegant, sophisticated hideaway is for you. Antique
furniture, hand-painted murals, and the Italian marble floor that adorns
the exquisite lobby give the Plaza Athénée a distinctly European feel.
Service here is as good as it gets with personalized check-in and an atten-
tive staff. The rooms come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but all are high-
ceilinged and spacious with entrance foyers that give them a residential
feel. The suites have closet space the size of some New York apartments.
The marble bathrooms are outfitted with thick robes made exclusively for
the hotel; put one on and you may never want to take it off. The lush
lounge is appropriately called Bar Seine and is a welcome spot for a pre-
dinner cocktail. They’ve upgraded their technology, now offering the iPod
docking stations, Wi-Fi, and flatscreen TVs and DVD players that are prac-
tically standard in hotels at this price level. Still, you don’t come to the
Plaza Athénée for the high-tech life; you come to escape it.

to many extras such as a steam room and sauna, free high-speed Internet,
complimentary continental breakfast, and decent-size rooms including a
number with bunk beds, Hotel QT is one of the best. Upon entering, you
check in at a kiosk/front desk where you can pick up magazines or essen-
tials to stock your minibar. Making your way to the elevators, you might
see guests swimming in the lobby pool or having a drink at the pool’s
swim-up bar. The rooms are sparse in tone, but the platform beds —
queen- and king-size — are plush and come equipped with Egyptian-cotton
sheets. Bathrooms are small, and sliding doors hide either the shower or
the toilet. But for such great amenities at moderate prices, why quibble?

least expensive rooms here. Nice features include cushioned headboards,
firm mattresses, nice built-in wardrobes, and spacious, nicely tiled bath-

Midtown East
This elegant, Japanese-owned Murray Hill gem offers a unique mix of East
and West sensibilities. The marble and mahogany lobby, with its Y-shaped
staircase and Botero bronze Dog, is one of the most attractive in New York.
If you’re a very lucky (and wealthy) individual, you’ll get the opportunity
to stay in one of three one-bedroom town-house suites, each with sunken
living rooms, bay windows, and original, eclectic art. Or, if your sensibili-
ties are Eastern-oriented, the hotel offers a Tatami suite, with tatami mats,
rice-paper screens, and a Japanese Tea Ceremony room. Most rooms are
not quite that luxurious or unique, but all include tasteful mahogany fur-
niture, soundproof windows, and green tea upon arrival. Marble bath-
rooms are large and have heated towel racks and removable shower
heads. At the mezzanine-level bar lounge, Wednesday through Saturday
evenings feature live jazz.

Larchmont Hotel
$
Greenwich Village
On a tree-lined block in a residential part of Greenwich Village, you find
this wonderful European-style hotel. Maybe that’s why it has a loyal
European following. Each bright guest room is tastefully done in rattan and
outfitted with a writing desk, a mini library of books, an alarm clock, a sink,
and a few extras that you normally have to pay a lot more for, such as
cotton bathrobes, slippers, and ceiling fans. Every floor has two shared
bathrooms (with hair dryers) and a small, simple kitchen. This hotel is a
great choice if you’re on a budget and don’t mind sharing a bathroom. (The
$229 “Family Room” has a private bathroom.) And if you’re looking for a
trendy downtown base that’s close to some of the city’s best shopping,
dining, and sightseeing (and your choice of subway lines are just a walk
away), you can’t do much better than the Larchmont.

Le Parker Meridien just about has it all. The gorgeous, bustling lobby also
serves as a public space, and elevators with televisions that show Tom &
Jerry and Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons and Charlie Chaplin shorts are a
wonder for the kids. The spacious hotel rooms, decorated in a Room &
Board style, have a fun feel to them with hidden drawers and swirling tele-
vision platforms, inventively exploiting an economical use of space. The
slate and limestone bathrooms are large but come only with a shower.
Norma’s serves one of the best breakfasts in the city, and the burgers at
Burger Joint are the best in the city (see Chapter 10). A stay at Le Parker

The Library Hotel

Midtown East
I’m usually suspicious of theme hotels, but because I’m a degreed librar-
ian, this one is an exception. Each of the ten guest-room floors is dedicated
to one of the ten major categories of the Dewey Decimal System. In the
Geography and Travel room, for example, are books such as Barcelona by
Robert Hughes and Bella Tuscany by Frances Mayes. You may not have the
chance to read any of them, but there is something comforting about
having them by the bed. Or maybe it’s just the comfy rooms, which come
in three categories: petite (really small), deluxe, and junior suite; they fea-
ture mahogany built-ins, generous desks, and immaculate marble bath-
rooms. The public spaces feature a reading room where wine and cheese
and a complimentary breakfast are served daily, and a writer’s den with a
fireplace, flatscreen TV, and a rooftop terrace.

The Lowell

Upper East Side
The Lowell’s style of luxury is best described as sophisticated opulence.
It has the feel of a residential dwelling; the lobby is small and clubby with
first-rate European, old-world service. The rooms are the real treasures
here, each different from the other and all very good sizes. About two-
thirds are suites with kitchenettes or fully equipped kitchens; some have
private terraces and most have working fireplaces. In the rooms you’ll also
find nice big, cushy armchairs, lots of leather, interesting artwork, and
porcelain figurines scattered about. Bathrooms are Italian marble and out-
fitted with Bulgari amenities. The Pembroke Room offers breakfast,
including a hearty English breakfast and afternoon tea while the Post
House is best known for its steaks. On a quiet, tree-lined street 1 block
from Central Park and right in the middle of Madison Avenue shopping,
the Lowell’s location is ideal for those who want (and can afford) an urban
retreat away from the Midtown madness.

stocked minifridges, microwaves, sitting rooms with sofas, and extra tele-
visions. The ground-floor Mediterranean restaurant, Nice Matin, offers
room service. Or you may want to skip room service and order takeout
from nearby Zabar’s or H&H Bagels.

The Mercer
$$$$$
SoHo
The best of the downtown, celebrity-crawling, hip hotels, the Mercer is a
place where even those who represent the antithesis of hip can feel at
home. The hotel is at the corner of Mercer and Prince streets, the epicen-
ter of SoHo, but once you get inside there is a pronounced calm — from the
postmodern library lounge and the relaxed staff, to the huge soundproof
loftlike guest rooms; the hotel is a perfect complement to the scene outside

your big window. The Mercer is one of the few New York hotels with ceil-
ing fans, and even if you don’t need to use them they look very nice
whirring above your extremely comfortable bed. The tile-and-marble bath-
rooms have a steel cart for storage and an oversize shower stall or over-
size two-person tub (state your preference when booking).

Chapter 9: Checking In at New York City’s Best Hotels 111
Country in the city
If you’re looking for an alternative to the quintessential huge New York hotel or if you
want a taste of urban hominess where you may actually meet your innkeeper, you
have a number of options to consider.
On the steep end of the economic scale, but worth the price (if authentic 19th-century
Victorian romance is what you’re seeking), is the fabulous Inn at Irving Place, 56 Irving
Place (between 17th and 18th streets; % 800-685-1447 or 212-533-4600; www.
innatirving.com; see the “Midtown Hotels” map). Rates range from $445 to $645.
All 12 rooms in this 170-year-old town house are named after late-19th-century or
early-20th-century New Yorkers, many inspired by the works of Edith Wharton and
Henry James. Complimentary breakfast is served each morning in Lady Mendl’s Tea
Salon, where, if the weather is nippy, you can find a comforting fire roaring.
Breakfast prepared by culinary students at the New School is one of the highlights of
the Inn on 23rd, 131 W. 23rd St. (between Sixth and Seventh avenues; % 877-387-2323
or 212-463-0330; www.innon23rd.com; see the “Midtown Hotels” map). Each of the
14 rooms, ranging in price from $249 to $389, was distinctly decorated by the person-
able owner, Annette Fisherman, with items collected from her travels.
The first home of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, an 1850 brownstone in the heart of
Chelsea, is now the charming Colonial House Inn, 318 W. 22nd St. (between Eighth
and Ninth avenues; % 800-689-3779 or 212-243-9669; www.colonialhouse
inn.com; see the “Midtown Hotels” map). This 20-room, four-story walk-up caters to
a largely GLBT clientele, but everybody is welcome, and straight couples are a
common sight. Some rooms have shared bathrooms; deluxe rooms have private bath-
rooms, and some have working fireplaces. The inn has a roof deck with a clothing-
optional area. Breakfast is included in the rates, which range from $110 to $130 for a
shared bathroom or $160 for a deluxe.
On the popular yet still residential Upper West Side is the aptly named Country Inn the
City, 270 W. 77th St. (between Broadway and West End Avenue; % 212-580-4183;
www.countryinnthecity.com; see the “Uptown Hotels” map). This 1891 town
house has only four rooms, but all are spacious, quaintly decorated, and come with full
kitchens. Rates range from $210 to $350 and include breakfast items stocked in your
refrigerator. But you’re on your own here in many respects. You won’t find a resident
innkeeper, and a maid only services your room every few days. Still, if you’re the inde-
pendent sort, the inn’s charm makes it an excellent choice.

The Peninsula New York
$$$$$
Midtown East
Housed in a beauty of a Beaux Arts building, the Peninsula is the perfect
combination of old-world charm and modern technology. Rooms are huge
with plenty of closet and storage space, but best of all is the bedside 
control panel that allows you to regulate lighting, television, stereo, air-
conditioning, and the DO NOT DISTURB sign on your door. Even though you
really don’t have to leave the comfort of your bed, eventually you will need
to go to the bathroom and when you do, you’ll not be disappointed. The
huge marble bathrooms have spacious soaking tubs with yet another con-
trol panel at your fingertips including the controls for, in most rooms, a
television so you can watch while taking your bubble bath (now that’s
happy excess). The Peninsula also features one of the best and biggest
New York hotel health clubs and spas, the rooftop Pen-Top Bar, and a
concierge desk offering Silver Spoon service for the kids (it does include
a Tiffany silver spoon engraved with your child’s initials). All this won-
derfulness, however, doesn’t come cheap, but if a splurge is what you
want, you won’t do much better than the Peninsula.

Red Roof Inn Manhattan
$
Midtown West
Manhattan’s first and only Red Roof Inn offers a bit of relief from Midtown’s
high-priced hotel scene. Both the recently renovated rooms and bath-
rooms are more spacious than you may find at most hotels in this price
category. The high-ceilinged lobby also has an elegant feel, again unusual
for a budget hotel. What’s more, the amenities are as good as many more
expensive competitors’, and furnishings are comfortable. Located close to
the Empire State Building and Herald Square, on a street in Manhattan’s
Koreatown, the air is permeated by the smell of Korean barbecue, which
can be good or bad, depending on how you feel about Korean barbecue.
Complimentary continental breakfast adds to the good value.
See map p. 98. 6 W. 32nd St. (between Broadway and Fifth Avenue), 2 blocks south
of the Empire State Building. % 800-567-7720 or 212-643-7100. Fax: 212-643-7101.

stay free in parent’s room. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
The Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park
$$$$
Financial District
At the extreme southern tip of Manhattan, you can’t get farther downtown
than this hotel. And if you don’t mind being away from most of the action,
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
112

no options are better than this one. Not only do you get typically excel-
lent Ritz service, but you also get amazing views of New York Harbor from
most guest rooms. You can even use one of the hotel telescopes for close-
ups of Lady Liberty. This modern, Art Deco–influenced high-rise is differ-
ent in style than the English countryside look of most Ritz-Carlton hotels,
but that’s where the differences end. Here you find the full slate of com-
forts and services typical of Ritz-Carlton, from Frette-dressed feather beds
to the chain’s signature Bath Butler, who will draw a scented bath for you
in your own deep soaking tub. Standard rooms are all very large and have
huge bathrooms, while suites are bigger than most city apartments. The
Rise Bar on the 14th floor is a special place for a cocktail and a sunset.
See map p. 96. 2 West St., across the street from Battery Park. % 800-241-3333 or
212-344-0800. Fax: 212-344-3801. www.ritzcarlton.com. Subway: 4, 5 to Bowling
Green. Valet parking: $50. Rack rates: $325–$675 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park
$$$$$
Midtown West
Not only does this Ritz own one of the best locations in the city, on Central
Park South overlooking Central Park, but it also, despite the incredible lux-
uriousness, manages to maintain a homey elegance that does not intimi-
date you. Rooms are spacious and decorated in traditional, English
countryside style. Suites are huge, and rooms facing Central Park come
with telescopes. The marble bathrooms are also oversize and feature a
choice of bathrobes — terry or silk — and Frédéric Fekkai bath amenities.
For families who can afford the very steep prices, the hotel is extremely
kid-friendly. Suites have sofa beds, and cribs and rollaway beds can be
brought in. Adults can enjoy BLT Market restaurant (by chef Laurent
Tourondel, also responsible for BLT Fish and BLT Steak, both reviewed in
Chapter 10) and the Switzerland-based La Prairie Spa.

The Roger
$$$
Midtown East
This Murray Hill hotel, also known as the Hotel Roger Williams, was reno-
vated and reborn with a bold, colorful new look and style. The welcoming
lobby has an odd assortment of mod yet comfortable seating. The rooms
come in a number of varieties — some small, some generous, some with
huge landscaped terraces, others with views of the nearby Empire State
Building — and all with impressive amenities such as colorful quilts,
flatscreen televisions, complimentary high-speed Internet, and good-sized
marble bathrooms. The Roger is one of the top choices in what is a quiet,
yet convenient Midtown location. A floating granite staircase leads from
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York City’s Best Hotels 113

the lobby to a mezzanine lounge, where you can breakfast in the morning
and drink cocktails by candlelight at night.

Sofitel New York
$$$
Midtown West
The block of 44th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues is known as
“Hotel Row,” and some of its hotels are historic and extremely elegant. The
soaring Sofitel is the best of the bunch. Thanks to the hotel’s entrance and
the warm, inviting lobby with check-in tucked off to the side, it feels like
you’re entering a grande dame hotel and not one that is no more than a
decade old. The designers have successfully melded modern amenities
with European old-world elegance. The rooms are spacious and ultra-com-
fortable, adorned with art from New York and Paris. The lighting is soft
and romantic, and walls and windows are soundproof. Suites are extra-spe-
cial, equipped with king-size beds, two televisions, and pocket doors sepa-
rating the bedroom from the sitting room. Bathrooms in all rooms are
fantastic, with separate showers and soaking tubs. A stylish French restau-
rant called Gaby bakes delicious croissants for breakfast.

Travel Inn
$$
Midtown West
Though it’s a bit too close to the busy, exhaust-choked Lincoln Tunnel, the
Travel Inn makes up for its location with extras such as a huge outdoor
pool and sun deck, a sunny and up-to-date fitness room, and free indoor
parking (with in-and-out privileges!). The interior is clean and reminiscent
of a chain motel, but for these prices, you get good-sized rooms that are
comfortably furnished, with extra-firm beds and work desks; even the
smallest double is sizable and has a roomy bathroom, and double/doubles
make great affordable shares for families. Bathrooms are basic yet clean
and fresh-looking. This spot is close to Times Square, many Off-Broadway
theaters, and the inexpensive dining options of nearby Hell’s Kitchen.

Trump International Hotel & Tower
$$$$$
Upper West Side
From the outside, it’s just your typical tall, dark, not very attractive Trump
monolith, but spend a night or two inside and you’ll forgive and forget the

Donald’s hokey grandiose taste in design. Experience services like your
own Trump Attaché, a personal concierge who provides comprehensive
services; take advantage of facilities like a 6,000-square-foot health club
with a lap pool and full-service spa; or order room service from the hotel’s
signature restaurant, the four-star Jean-Georges (or arrange for an in-room
chef to prepare a meal in your room’s fully equipped kitchen). Enjoy the
hotel’s impeccable service and first-class facilities from a lovely yet sur-
prisingly understated high-ceilinged room with floor-to-ceiling windows,
some of which offer incredible views of Central Park. You also get sump-
tuous bathrobes, telescopes for taking in the view, and marble bathrooms
with Jacuzzi tubs.

The Waldorf=Astoria and The Waldorf Towers
$$$$
Midtown East
This massive 1-square-block Art Deco masterpiece is not only a hotel icon,
but a New York City landmark and the epitome of old-school elegance. The
lobby is so big and grand, it’s reminiscent of Grand Central Terminal, down
to its own signature clock. With over 1,000 rooms, the pace can be hectic,
but after you’re in your room — all airy with high ceilings, traditional
décor, comfortable linens and beds, and spacious marble bathrooms —
you quickly chill out. If you crave more luxury, book a room on the Astoria
level, which features huge suites, deluxe bathroom amenities, access to
the Astoria Lounge for breakfast or afternoon hors d’oeuvres, and free
entry to the hotel’s fitness club (others pay a fee); or for even more opu-
lence, try a suite in the Waldorf Towers. One of three bars in the hotel, Sir
Harry’s Bar (off the lobby) is the main gathering spot for a pre- or post-
dinner cocktail, but even better is Bull & Bear with its signature round
mahogany bar, classic original cocktail creations, and celebrated steaks.

This seven-story hotel is ideal for those Wall Street businesspeople who

forting, and serene, and the friendly, professional staff offers the kind of
personalized service you won’t get from a chain. Rooms aren’t huge, but

Dining and Snacking in 
New York City
In This Chapter
 Landing a reservation at a hot restaurant
 Finding out about your dining options
 Getting the most out of your food budget
 Discovering the top New York City restaurants
You can’t do better than New York for dining possibilities — the city
is bursting with restaurants of every type and category. You could
eat out every night of the year and still have a mountain of restaurants
to climb before you’d been to them all. Chefs are as famous as rock
stars, and when a new restaurant opens, the pomp and circumstance
sometimes equals the opening of a Broadway show. What I’m trying to
say is that eating out in New York is a very big deal — something many
New Yorkers take seriously.
The variety of restaurants in New York is staggering — from American to
multiethnic, from a simple diner to an elegant four-star palace. All that
variety can be intimidating, but it shouldn’t be. You know what you like;
now you just need to know where to find it.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Unless the restaurant you’re interested in doesn’t take reservations, it
always pays to make a reservation, especially if your party is bigger than
two. You’ve got nothing to lose by calling ahead. If you’re booking dinner
on a weekend night, it’s a good idea to call at least a few days in advance.
And if you’re really set on visiting one very special restaurant, let’s say
Gramercy Tavern, call well in advance, preferably before you even arrive
in the city. You can make reservations for many of New York’s great
restaurants online at Open Table (www.opentable.com).
If can’t get a reservation for the dates you want, try for an early dinner,
between 5 and 6 p.m., or a later one, after 9 p.m. That’s all you may be
offered anyway, so you may have to take what you can get.

Most top places start taking reservations 30 days in advance, so if you
want to eat at a hot restaurant at a popular hour — Saturday at 8 p.m.,
say, at Daniel — start dialing 30 days prior at 9 a.m. If you’re booking a
holiday dinner, call earlier. Many of the top restaurants require you to
leave a credit card number when making a reservation, and if you don’t
show up, they penalize you with a service charge.
Smoking is banned in all restaurants all over the city, with the exception
of some outdoor spaces.
More sources to scope out the dining scene
The best online restaurant sources are
 Citysearch (http://newyork.citysearch.com): Runs a compre-
hensive restaurant page with a number of helpful editors’ lists and
summaries.
 New York magazine (http://nymag.com/restaurants): The
online arm of weekly New York magazine keeps tally of restaurant
openings and closings and offers an extensive searchable database,
with links to menus.
 The New York Times (www.nytimes.com): The “Dining & Wine”
features in the Style section include the paper’s very influential
restaurant reviews and blogs by critic Frank Bruni and award-
winning cookbook author Mark Bittman.
 The Village Voice (www.villagevoice.com): Especially good for
the cheap-eats reviews (“Counter Culture”) by Robert Sietsema.
The best online source for the serious foodie is Chowhound (www.
chowhound.com), a national Web site with message boards in local
areas, including New York, where you can make an inquiry about a cer-
tain restaurant, type of food, or location, and, within a few hours, you
may have five or more very informative responses.
The Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com), a guide that made a name for itself
by rating restaurants based on extensive diner surveys, maintains a
searchable database. It charges a fee to access more complete online
details, which, with all the other better online options available, doesn’t
seem worth it just for restaurant information. If you’re really interested
in what your fellow diners have to say, you’re better off just buying the
book (or browse the free member reviews and judge for yourself).
If you don’t feel the need for a book, stop at any newsstand for a copy of
the slick weekly Time Out New York; the “Eat Out” section includes list-
ings for TONY’s 100 Favorite Restaurants in every issue, as well as cover-
age of new openings and dining trends. Weekly New York magazine also
maintains restaurant listings in the “Agenda” section at the back of the
magazine.

Trimming the fat from your budget
Prices in New York are high, but you can eat well without spending a for-
tune if you follow a few simple rules — and you never need to sacrifice
quality. The best and most famous restaurants are expensive, but you
don’t need to pay through the nose if you keep these tips in mind.
 Go for the prix-fixe menu at top restaurants. Usually, the best
deals are at lunch, when many of the best restaurants in New York
offer a special deal — a three-course meal for considerably less
than you would pay à la carte or at dinnertime.
 Watch your drinks tab. Restaurants get you with the drinks, espe-
cially the wine. That’s where they make their money. I wouldn’t
dream of suggesting that you should deny yourself the pleasure of
an aperitif or a properly paired wine with your meal, but if money is
an object, go for quality over quantity.
 Skip the national fast-food chains and go for local food. It may be
fast, but it’s not as cheap as advertised, and with so many good,
inexpensive local restaurants, you really have no excuse for eating
at a national fast-food chain while in New York. See “Dining and
Snacking on the Go,” later in this chapter for suggestions.
 Order takeout. Thousands of takeout places all over Manhattan
deliver to hotel rooms for free, and they offer food more varied and
far less expensive than room service. (Don’t forget to tip the deliv-
ery person.)
 Avoid eating in Times Square and Rockefeller Center. Not only
are food prices jacked up in these major tourist attractions, but the
food is usually not very good. Try to plan your meals and snacks
for before or after you visit the big tourist sights, or in adjacent
neighborhoods, rather than the busiest hubs of visitor activity.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 121
Fixed-price deals at top restaurants
New York’s popular Restaurant Week, held every January and June, pioneered the idea
of offering prix-fixe (fixed-price) bargain meals to attract new customers to the city’s
best (and expensive) restaurants. In 2008, the price was $24.07 (24/7, get it?) for lunch,
$35 for dinner. The idea was wildly successful, and a number of restaurants have
extended the offer throughout the year. Restaurant Week has its detractors, however;
some kitchens seem to be asleep at the wheel, perhaps turned off by what is perceived
as a less discerning clientele and offering meals that are not representative of their usual
high (and higher-priced) quality. When choosing a restaurant, consider the Restaurant
Week menu on offer (it’s sometimes available on the restaurant’s Web site); the places
that maintain fixed-price menus year-round tend to remain on their game even during
hectic Restaurant Week. Also, make your choice(s) quickly and snap up your reserva-
tions; the top tables are taken but fast. Check www.nycvisit.com or www.
opentable.com for participating restaurants and reservation information.

For the listings in this chapter, I offer two price indicators for each
restaurant: a number of dollar signs, which gives you an idea of what a
complete meal costs; and the price range of the entrees on the menu.
Those two pieces of information can help you choose a place that’s right
for you and your budget.
One dollar sign ($) means inexpensive, and five dollar signs ($$$$$ —
the maximum) means extravagant. The symbols reflect what one person
can expect to pay for an appetizer, entree, dessert, one drink, tax, and
tip. Here’s a more complete key to the dollar-sign ratings that I use in
this chapter:
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
$
Under $35
$$
$35–$59
$$$
$60–$84
$$$$
$85–$100
$$$$$
Over $100
Our dollar signs give you a rough idea of how much a meal will cost, but
don’t use them as the only factor in your decision; restaurants may offer
prix-fixe meals or other deals that aren’t reflected in their price rankings.
As you peruse the listings, check the maps in this chapter to pinpoint a
restaurant’s location. The indexes at the end of this chapter can help
you select a restaurant by location, cuisine, or price.
New York’s Best Restaurants
Antique Garage
$$
SoHo
MEDITERRANEAN
It is exactly what it says it is: a former auto garage that now sells antiques —
and Mediterranean food. Truth to tell, I’m recommending this place at least
as much for the atmosphere as for the food. The décor is fantastically allur-
ing — mirrors, candelabras and lamps, velvet chairs, and paintings hang-
ing from brick walls — and live jazz nearly every evening and during the
weekend brunch hours (noon to 5 p.m.) enlivens the buzzing social scene.
It’s an unpretentious place for mezes such as hummus and Circassian
chicken (shredded breast meat in a garlicky sauce), panini, and salads. In
warm-weather months, it’s the perfect spot to have a feta cheese omelet
and Bellini for brunch and enjoy some of the best people-watching in SoHo.
See map p. 124. 41 Mercer St. (near Grand Street). % 212-219-1019. www.antique
garagesoho.com. Reservations recommended. Subway: A, C, E, N, R to Canal
Street. Main courses: $16–$18 lunch, $18–$24 dinner. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open:
Mon–Fri noon to 11 p.m., Sat–Sun noon to midnight.
Part III: Settling Into New York City

A.O.C. Bedford
$$$$
Greenwich Village
MEDITERRANEAN
You’ll find this brick-walled, cozy romantic charmer tucked away on
equally cozy and romantic Bedford Street in the West Village. Here the
A.O.C in the restaurant name stands for appellation d’origine contrôlée —
the French designation for high-quality food products. But on the menu
you’ll not only find A.O.C. products from France, but D.O.C., the Italian des-
ignation, and D.O., the Spanish. But you won’t need all those designations
to know that what you’re eating is of high quality — just a few bites will suf-
fice. The paella marinara, a constant on the menu, is prepared for two,
stuffed with jumbo shrimp (heads on for more flavor), squid, scallops,
mussels, and clams and cooked perfectly in Spanish Calasparra rice. Finish
your meal with a selection of cheeses, A.O.C.-, D.O.C.-, and D.O.-quality, of
course. The restaurant has an impressive wine list, and bottles are, as they
should be, decanted at your table.
See map p. 124. 14 Bedford St. (between Sixth Avenue and Downing Street). % 212-
414-4764. Reservations recommended. Subway: 1 to Houston Street; A, B, C, E, F, V
to West 4th Street. Main courses: $21–$36. AE, MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 5:30–11 p.m.,
Fri–Sat 5:30–11:30 p.m.
àpizz
$$$
Lower East Side
ITALIAN
The neon red sign outside is just the flicker of the warmth you find inside
this romantic, rustic brick-walled oasis. I always wondered what the word
canoodle really meant, and if you bring your lover to àpizz, that’s exactly
what you’ll do . . . whenever you can pry the forks from one another’s
hands. Primi include salads and Margherita (tomato) and bianco (“white,”
or ricotta) brick-oven pizzas, all excellent starts and not overly filling. For
secondi, I highly recommend the razza, baked skate fish in white-wine
sauce — for this skate fan, it’s one of the best in town. You can’t go wrong
with any of the house-made desserts (including apple-pecan crumble and
cheesecake). It can get rather warm in here, but whether that’s due to the
oven dominating the room or the heat between you and your date is for
you to determine.
See map p. 124. 217 Eldridge St. (between Stanton and Rivington streets). % 212-253-
9199. www.apizz.com. Reservations strongly recommended. Subway: F, V to
Second Avenue. Main courses: $22–$34. AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 6–11 p.m.
Aquavit
$$$$$
Midtown East
SCANDINAVIAN
This sleek restaurant is in the bottom of a glass tower on East 55th Street,
and designed in Scandinavian style with modernist furniture. In the front
of the restaurant is an informal and less-expensive cafe; past a long bar 
is the dining room. Everything here is first-rate. The smoked fish — really
all the fish — is prepared perfectly. The herring sampler is the stuff of 
daydreams: four types of herring accompanied by a tiny glass of Aquavit,

Barbetta
$$$$
Midtown West
ITALIAN
The debate over what is New York’s oldest restaurant rages on, and
Barbetta (est. 1906), is in the thick of that debate. But there is no argument
about Barbetta’s sustained excellence. The first, and still one of the few,
New York restaurants to serve cuisine from Piemonte, Italy’s northwest-
ernmost region, Barbetta’s food, like its décor, is richly elegant. If you dine
in the autumn or winter, you might have the pleasure of white truffles,
flown in from Piemonte and shaved over your already decadent gnochetti
ai formaggi, freshly-made, delicate gnocchi in an unforgettable cheese
sauce. You can choose from one of the restaurant’s 1906 creations like the
bolliti misti, a Piemontesi specialty, a mix of boiled meats and broth served
from an antique silver cart, but for a meal that requires this much prepa-
ration, you must order 48 hours in advance. In the warmer months,
Barbetta also features one of the city’s most romantic outdoor gardens.
Though many come for the pre-theater prix fixe, Barbetta is best experi-
enced at a relaxed, leisurely pace.

BLT Fish
$$$$
Flatiron District
SEAFOOD
BLT (Bistro Laurent Tourendel) Fish is one of three restaurants in
chef/owner Tourondel’s Manhattan mini-empire (see review of BLT Steak).
This, his seafood branch, is actually two restaurants with two distinct
kitchens. The downstairs is a casual, moderately-priced faux seafood
shack with a raw bar, fried fare, and the much-in-demand (deservedly so)
lobster roll. Upstairs — you can walk the steps or take a glass elevator —
is the elegant (with prices to match) dining room. Here you can sit under
a skylight or near the open kitchen and watch an army of servers move
from the kitchen through the room with huge platters topped with whole
fish, which are dressed up beautifully and ready for consumption. The
crispy red snapper “Cantonese style” is filleted table-side. But you have to
crack the hard salt shell of the sea-salt-crusted New Zealand pink snapper
to get to the tender, juicy flesh underneath. Expect great seafood, but don’t
expect quiet conversation.

BLT Steak
$$$$$
Midtown East
STEAKHOUSE
Steakhouses are often stereotyped as bastions of male bonding, testos-
terone-fueled with red meat and hearty drinks. But BLT Steak breaks that
mold in a big way; the crowd is more eclectic, and there are plenty of slinky
women chomping on thick cuts of beef. (Tourondel’s reinvention of the
steakhouse is broadly appealing: BLT Steak now has outposts in seven
other cities, including San Juan, Puerto Rico.) The beef is served in cast-
iron pots and finished in steak butter with a choice of sauces — béarnaise,
red wine, horseradish, and blue cheese, to name a few. I tend to go for the
hangar steak, but the New York strip and the short ribs braised in red wine
are also good bets. Save room for the complimentary popovers and an
appetizer like the incredible tuna tartare or a side of onion rings. This is
not a restaurant for intimate conversation; even the music is muffled by
the cacophonous din of the diners.

Blue Ribbon Brasserie
$$$
SoHo
AMERICAN
Brothers Bruce and Eric Bromberg opened this American-style brasserie
over 15 years ago to such success that they now have eight restaurants in
their New York mini-empire. The Jersey-bred, French-trained chefs built
on two key features: late hours for night owls and a wide-roaming menu
with room for everything from burgers, fried chicken, and catfish to escar-
gots, pirogies, and paella. I can tick off many favorites here: the mixed
greens and smoked trout salads; the onion soup, in my opinion the only
one in the city really worth eating; the red trout with almonds; the choco-
late bruno dessert. . . . In case you’re wondering if there’s anything the
brothers Bromberg don’t serve, the answer is no: Blue Ribbon Sushi, one
of the city’s top sushi bars, is just down the street at no. 119 (% 212-
343-0404), and Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill recently opened uptown at
308 W. 58th St., at Columbus Circle (% 212-397-0404).

Bubby’s Pie Co.
$$
TriBeCa
AMERICAN
Brave the lines to get in, squeeze into one of the close tables, try to block
out the noise, and as soon as you begin to eat Bubby’s comfort food, you
immediately forget all that discomfort. Whether it’s the slow-cooked
pulled-pork barbecue; the magnificent meatloaf; or the buttermilk-fried
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
132

half-chicken, with sides such as sautéed spinach, macaroni and cheese, or
onion straws, Bubby’s dishes define comfort. Save room for the desserts,
especially the homemade pies; one taste of the apple pie immediately
brings on a flood of happy childhood flashbacks. Breakfast is big here and
lasts well into the middle of the day. Brunch is a big thing in trendy TriBeCa
and on weekends the waits can get very lengthy. Celebrities need comfort
too, and you may spot one or two at Bubby’s seeking anonymity and down-
home chow. There is a second location in Brooklyn at 1 Main St. in DUMBO
(% 718-222-0666; see the “Brooklyn Dining” map).

Café des Artistes
$$$$$
Upper West Side
FRENCH
One of the oldest restaurants in Manhattan, Café des Artistes was estab-
lished in 1917, and with its gorgeous “wood nymph” murals painted in the
1930s, it’s still one of the most romantic restaurants in the city. The solid,
French country food is expensive, but this is a place to splurge, to soak in
not only the history but the romantic aura exuding from those murals. You
don’t find any fancy twists on French cooking here, and if they appear on
the menu, stick with the old favorites, like starters such as salmon four
ways; or entrees such as grilled striped bass niçoise, or the hearty pot au
feu, complete with marrow bone. Even the pomme frites (french fries) are
extra tasty (though, at $8 a side, they should be). For dessert, the hot-
fudge Napoleon is a treat. The waiters here have been around the block a
few times, so service is refreshingly old school. The restaurant does a
brisk, pre–Lincoln Center business, so if you want intimacy and romance
(the main reason to come here), reserve before or after the rush.

Calle Ocho
$$$
Upper West Side
LATIN
The Upper West Side was long considered a culinary wasteland, so Calle
Ocho’s arrival — and with it, a big, boisterous space, adventurous pan-
Latin food, and killer mojitos — was greeted with an enthusiasm that has
yet to abate. The entrees, such as ropa vieja (stewed beef), paella, and
Cuban skirt steak, may take a back seat to appetizers including Puerto
Rican rum-glazed shrimp and Costa Rican soft tacos and a variety of
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 133

seviches, washed down with mojitos, sangria, or caipirinhas (a potent 
traditional Brazilian cocktail). (The wine list isn’t extensive — cocktails
are what you want here.) Come to party; the space can get noisy, and it’s
not really the spot for intimate conversations. Sunday brunch is also popu-
lar here.

Carmine’s
$$
Upper West Side
ITALIAN
This fun, family-style Upper West Side institution will not let you go home
hungry. Portions are huge, and though big can often mean bad, it doesn’t
at Carmine’s. Remarkably, this place turns out better pasta and entrees
than many 20-table Italian restaurants in the city. I’ve never had pasta here
that wasn’t al dente and the marinara sauce is as good as any I’ve had in
Manhattan. For starters, the daily salads are always fresh and the moun-
tainous platter of fried calamari perfectly tender. Rigatoni with sausage
and broccoli is a pasta standout, and the best meat entrees include veal
parmigiana, broiled porterhouse steak, and the chicken scarpariello
(chicken pan-broiled with a lemon-rosemary sauce). The tiramisu is pie-
size, thick and creamy, and bathed in Kahlúa and Marsala. Order half of
what you think you need. Bring the kids and plan to enjoy a raucous meal;
in fact, earplugs may be in order. Unless you come early, expect to wait.
Carmine’s also has a usually jampacked outlet in Times Square at 200 W.
44th St. (% 212-221-3800).

’Cesca
$$$$
Upper West Side
ITALIAN
The Italian food at ’Cesca is not quite as innovative as it once was, but it’s
still more special than most New Yorkers have experienced. With a wood-
burning oven used to roast everything from oysters to peppers, this place
is as rustic as it gets. Imagine yourself in an Italian farmhouse where you’re
served slow-cooked meats, like pork shank with the fat cooked off and the
meat falling from the bone or a slow-roasted duck. Try to save room for
the delectable desserts, like rosemary panna cotta. Service is friendly and
informal, and the restaurant is spacious and comfortable with a large bar
area with long tables where you snack on marinated olives, fritto misto, or
spicy Parmesan and prosciutto fritters while sipping unusual Italian wines.
’Cesca is one of the most popular restaurants on the Upper West Side, so
call well ahead for reservations.

Chanterelle
$$$$$
TriBeCa
FRENCH
If you want the royal treatment as you dine on excellent and innovative
French cuisine, you can’t do better than Chanterelle. The dining room is
simple but beautiful, with a pressed-tin ceiling, widely spaced large tables,
comfortable chairs, and gorgeous floral displays; the restaurant also
boasts a superb modern art collection. Expect knowledgeable service;
your waiter will have no trouble answering any questions you have about
the menu. The seasonal menu changes every few weeks, but one signature
dish appears on almost every menu: a marvelous grilled seafood sausage.
Cheese lovers should opt for a cheese course — the presentation and
selection can’t be beat. The wine list is superlative, though expensive.
Chanterelle is a place to celebrate.

SOUL FOOD
Having been born and largely raised in the South, I’m not about to waste
your time or embarrass myself by recommending a soul-food joint that I
wouldn’t take my folks to try. So you can trust that Charles’ is bona fide.
You don’t come here for a fancy setting; you come for soul food at its sim-
plest and freshest. And you better come hungry. The all-you-can-eat buffet
features crunchy, moist pan-fried chicken; ribs in a tangy sauce with meat
falling off the bone; smoky stewed oxtails in a thick brown onion gravy;
macaroni and cheese; collard greens with bits of smoked turkey; black-
eyed peas; and cornbread warm and not overly sweet. Hours seem to

Churrascaria Plataforma
$$$
Midtown West
BRAZILIAN
Brazilians do many things with style, and one of them is the rodizio, or
steakhouse. If a seemingly endless procession of grilled meats is your idea
of a dream meal, then Churrascaria Plataforma is for you. Even if it’s not,
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 135

you can find something to appreciate here; I am probably the last person
to try all-you-can-eat anything (as I rarely eat my money’s worth), but the
meats are truly delicious, and they’ll keep the caipirinhas coming, too. Just
graze the buffet-style salad bar and don’t fill up on the tempting breads.
Keep your eyes on the prize: the steady line of cuts of beef, pork, chicken,
lamb, even fish delivered to your table until you cry uncle. (The beef cuts
are particularly tasty, so prioritize those.) Go with a group so you can lean
on one another as you stagger out.

Country
$$$$$
Flatiron District
FRENCH
Supervised by Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef of the popular and acclaimed
Town restaurant, it’s hard to believe this elegant restaurant in the Hotel
Carlton could be the “country” in Zakarian’s Town/Country duo. There’s
really nothing country about the place. Gorgeously designed by architect
David Rockwell, the restaurant’s magnificent centerpiece is the restored
200-square-foot Tiffany skylight dome that was hidden for years by a
dropped ceiling. Zakarian’s menu, which changes practically daily,
matches the décor’s sophisticated style. Recent offerings have included
escargot risotto and rabbit with prosciutto, tortellini, and black truffles.
Of the third-course options, the halibut with Brussels sprouts and walnuts
was a standout. Downstairs is the more countrified, darker, wood-paneled
Café at Country.

Daniel
$$$$$
Upper East Side
FRENCH
Many reasons explain why Daniel (Daniel Boulud’s signature restaurant) is
a New York Times four-star winner: the luxurious décor, the comfortable
seating, the impeccable, white-gloved service — but the best reason is
Boulud’s faultless classic country French cooking. The menu is heavy with
game dishes in elegant but unfussy preparations, plus Daniel signatures
like black sea bass in a crisp potato shell, with tender leeks and a light

db Bistro Moderne
$$$$
Midtown West
FRENCH/AMERICAN
Compared to Daniel Boulud’s signature and formal restaurant Daniel (see
earlier listing), db Bistro Moderne is as casual as a burger joint. But casual
means the models who dine here wear Armani T-shirts while digging into
burgers that cost $32. Okay, so it’s not your typical coffee-shop burger:
Boulud’s famous creation is made with minced sirloin, foie gras, preserved
black truffle, and braised short ribs on a Parmesan onion roll. So casual may
mean many things, but here it does not mean cheap. Despite the silly burger
excess, the food is, like all Boulud’s ventures, outstanding — especially
bistro favorites such as bouillabaisse, coq au vin, and frogs’ legs.

Part of chef Danny Meyer’s restaurant group (which also includes
Gramercy Tavern, reviewed later in this chapter), Eleven Madison Park has

part to a reinvigoration by executive chef Daniel Humm. The main dining
room is spectacular, with sky-high ceilings, huge windows, and fresh flow-
ers everywhere. The colorful, creative food presentation is a worthy rival

El Faro
$$
Greenwich Village
LATIN
The oldest Spanish restaurant in New York, El Faro celebrated its 80th
birthday in 2007. But with one visit, you’ll feel like a regular and longtime
friend of the Lurgis family, who have owned the restaurant since 1959.
Maybe you’ll get to sit in what was writer James Baldwin’s favorite corner
table (the restaurant is mentioned in his biography), or one of the tables
off the bar, possibly the one that a resident ghost is rumored to occasion-
ally inhabit. The menu here features the exact same dishes brought from
Spain that are now so familiar such as paella a la Valenciana, shrimp al
ajillo, and mariscada (mixed seafood) with green sauce. Of course, all this
is complemented with El Faro’s particularly potent signature sangria, also
known as “truth serum.”

Flatiron District
FRENCH
This elegant, intimate restaurant serves a fresh, unfussy French cuisine
made from seasonal and local ingredients personally sourced by chef Cyril
Renaud. In a classic contemporary atmosphere (not quite the French-coun-
try style you may expect), you may dine on sautéed monkfish with bacon
and pecans, Berkshire pork loin, or braised veal short rib, all expertly
served. Appetizers have recently included roasted parsnip soup, and
desserts have included a caramelized apple-filled crepe with Devonshire
cream. I tend to come here for lunch with business associates and fellow
writers, but it’s the kind of place where you may also see a celebrity or
two trying to keep a low profile or a couple on a first date. I always enjoy

Flor de Mayo
$
Upper West Side
CHINO-LATINO
Cuban/Chinese cuisine is a New York phenomenon that started in the late
1950s when Cubans of Chinese heritage immigrated to New York after the
revolution. Most of the immigrants took up residence on the Upper West
Side, and Cuban/Chinese restaurants flourished. Many have disappeared,
but the best one, Flor de Mayo, remains and has morphed into a Chinese/
Peruvian joint. The kitchen does fine with both sides of the massive menu
Part III: Settling Into New York City

(lean toward the Latin side), but the best dish is the la brasa half-chicken
lunch special — beautifully spiced and slow-roasted until it’s fork tender
and falling off the bone, served with a giant pile of fried rice, bounteous
with roast pork, shrimp, and veggies. Service and atmosphere are remi-
niscent of Chinatown: efficient and lightning quick.

Frankie & Johnnie’s
$$$$
Midtown West
STEAKHOUSE
When a restaurant starts opening branches, red flags immediately go up.
Does that mean the restaurant has become a chain and quality has eroded
to chain-food status? In the case of Frankie & Johnnie’s, the legendary thea-
ter district former speak-easy-turned-steakhouse, which opened this outlet
in the two-story town house owned once by actor John Barrymore (plus
two others in the greater metro area), those fears were allayed after one
bite of their signature sirloin. Not only are Frankie & Johnnie’s steaks
vastly underrated in the competitive world of New York steakhouses, but
the other non-steak options are superb. The crab cake appetizer has an
overwhelmingly high crab-to-cake ratio. Service is old-school steakhouse,
and there’s a special perk at this particular location: If you’re staying in
Midtown, the restaurant provides complimentary stretch-limo service to

Ghenet
$$
Nolita
ETHIOPIAN
You can find a number of African cuisines in New York (especially in
Harlem), and one of the most popular is Ethiopian (in close competition
with a smattering of West African cuisines). Of the several excellent
Ethiopian restaurants around town, Ghenet has long been my favorite. The
setting may feel a little less authentic — you’re served at regular glass-
topped tables rather than at low tables surrounded by wooden stools —
but the food is not, and you eat it as Ethiopians do: with your fingers. I like
to start with the wicked-spicy kategna (I’ve been known to order two por-
tions at risk of burning a hole in my stomach — it’s that good). Use the
spongy injera bread to scoop up your entree, which is presented commu-
nal style on a single platter. The gomen be siga (tender beef cooked with
collard greens) is my standard, but go with anything that sounds appeal-
ing, as it’s clearly described on the menu. Alas, Ethiopians don’t seem to
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 139

prioritize desserts the way I do, so if you have a sweet tooth, follow up
elsewhere. Service is kind but often inattentive, so seize your opportuni-
ties to get what you need (including your check). When you’re done, you’ll
understand the restaurant’s motto, “Where Angels Eat.”

AMERICAN
Gramercy Tavern has been a New York favorite for special occasions for
well over a decade, but it has seen a recent resurgence thanks to executive
chef Michael Anthony (formerly of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, an upstate
restaurant/farm focused on organic and sustainable practices). If you can’t
score a reservation for the dining room, try your luck for a meal at the
more casual bar. In either case, you’ll be rewarded with truly delicious,
sophisticated American cuisine served by a crisply professional but friendly
and accommodating staff. Menus change seasonally, but I recently had a
refreshing carrot-and-calamari salad in lemon vinaigrette, followed by seared
scallops with pickle and peas. Mains such as the black bass with walnuts
and thinly shredded squash and the papardelle with tender beef ragu and
scallion are so satisfying that you’ll wish you could re-create them at home.
The entire experience is effortlessly artful. If you have room in a limited
budget for only one special meal while you’re in New York, make this one it.

Chinatown
CHINESE
So what if the restaurant has all the ambience of a school cafeteria? I’m
wary of an over-adorned dining room in Chinatown; the simpler the better.
And N.Y. Noodletown is simple, but the food is the real thing. The seafood-
based and wonton noodle soups are tasty goodness, and they alone would
make me very happy. But I’m greedy and wouldn’t leave the restaurant
without one of its perfectly prepared shrimp dishes, especially the salt-
baked shrimp. If you’re lucky and your hotel room has a good-sized refrige-
rator, take the leftovers home — they’ll make a great snack the next day.
N.Y. Noodletown keeps very long hours, which makes it one of the best
late-night bets in the neighborhood, too.

Haveli

INDIAN
New York is blessed with a number of great Indian restaurants, but I’m
fondest of Haveli for its low-key atmosphere and consistently satisfying
food. The dark bi-level interior is more subdued and upscale than the
cheaper joints on “Curry Row” (nearby on 6th Street), and a meal here is
an excellent value, given the high quality for reasonable prices. I like to
start with the palaka soup, even in summertime, and I usually opt for the
puri rather than nan bread, even though both are equally tasty. You can’t
go wrong with a single main dish; even the traditional murga tikka muslam
(otherwise known as chicken tikka masala), rogan josh, and mushroom
saag are revelations. Don’t leave without having the gulab jaman for
dessert; you never know how heavenly fried cheese balls in syrup can be
until you have them here.

plates that complement the wines. The panini are notable for their fresh-
ness and their delicacy, with the coppa (a spicy cured ham) and hot pep-
pers and rucola (arugula) being the standout. The “tramezzini,” crustless
sandwiches, are nothing like the crustless sandwiches served at high tea;
here you can have yours stuffed with tuna and chickpeas or with mor-
tadella and pickled red peppers. The “Fritto” section of the menu includes
a wonderful mozzarella in carroza, breaded mozzarella stuffed with a juicy
anchovy sauce and lightly fried. Whatever you order, don’t rush — ’inoteca

or three, T-bone, and filet mignon with the requisite sides such as creamed
spinach and hash browns — but it also serves chops: lamb chops, prime
rib, short ribs, and most notably, mutton chops. The mutton chop, with
its two flaps of long, thick, rich subtly gamey meat on either side of the
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 141

bone, has made Keens the original that it is. It’s no gussied-up remake of
old New York — it’s the real thing. Its authenticity shows in everything
from the thousands of ceramic pipes on the ceiling (regular diners, includ-
ing celebrities like Babe Ruth, George M. Cohan, and Albert Einstein, were
given their own personal pipes) to the series of wood-paneled rooms
(some with fireplaces), leather banquettes, a clubby bar with a three-page
menu of single malts, and even the framed playbill Lincoln was reading at
the Ford Theater that infamous evening in 1865.

spin on this Italian/French rendition of a bistro. Here you’ll find excellent
smoked mozzarella and ricotta fritters alongside escargots bordelaise. It
will be up to you to decide whether you imagine yourself in a Tuscan trat-
toria or a Provençal bistro. Or you can mix and match cuisines. Try the
pasta special of the day accompanied by mussels with a choice of sauce —
Provençal, Dijonnaise, or the comforting blend of shallots, parsley, and
white wine. Steaks and chops are cooked over an open fire and the steaks
are also offered with a variety of sauces. What keeps the neighbors pour-

you can eat very well here and not have to max out your credit card. The
food is consistently tasty, but don’t expect big portions. (That’s part of the
secret to the good value, but don’t worry — you won’t starve.) The menu
is thoughtful and creative, focusing on lusty Roman fare like ricotta gnoc-
chi with sausage and fennel, or saltimbocca. Wines, too, have been care-
fully chosen, and you can order a bottle from the extensive list or sample
one of several varieties that come in a carafe. Here, perhaps more than at

The closest you may ever get to boarding a luxury yacht is dining at this
subterranean seafood/sushi restaurant, all highly polished woods, navy-
blue fabrics, white leather, and porthole windows. The interiors were dam-
aged in a fire a couple of years ago, but you’d never know it — the
restoration was seamless. What has changed is that it now has more exten-
sive sushi offerings than before, and the raw bar has been scaled back. If
you’re going to do surf and turf, you may as well do it here; there are seve-
ral options (chicken, steak, even a cheeseburger) for those who got roped
into coming with a seafood-loving dining partner. My one gripe is the sepa-
rate charge for sides such as rice and hand-cut fries, a practice that started
with city steakhouses and seems have spread to nearly every high-end
restaurant in town. The service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is grown-
up but fun. Happy hour is weekdays from 5 to 7 p.m. (ahoy the Dark and

dumpling filled with pork and vegetables). Can’t choose? Sample them all
with a combo! Soups are also special here; try the beef noodle in a spicy,

and the place is usually packed with a well-heeled local crowd. The two
locations have different chefs, and menu items change based on what’s
available, but recent winners have included a juicy fried skate (served with

$6, making it a cheap and almost perfect lunch. The burritos are authen-
tic and meals unto themselves. The tinga burrito, shredded chicken in a
tomato-and-onion chipotle sauce, is a favorite. Each is stuffed with rice,
beans, and guacamole. Don’t get fancy here; stick with the tamales, burri-
tos, and soft tacos, the best being the taco al pastor, a taco stuffed with
pork marinated with pineapple and onions. And try the jamaica (pro-

Though the restaurant isn’t the celebrity magnet it once was, the food,

Ouest
$$$$
Upper West Side
AMERICAN
When chef/restaurateur Tom Valenti opened Ouest in 2001 it signaled a
welcome renaissance in the Upper West Side dining scene. And Ouest is
still one of the neighborhood’s shining stars. With plush red banquettes
and an intimate balcony area, Ouest is both cozy and clubby. Service is
personable but also efficiently professional. But what draws the crowds is
Valenti’s mastery in the kitchen, especially with meats such as his melt-in-
your-mouth braised beef short ribs. The quality suffers not one iota when
you switch to seafood. The proscuitto-wrapped cod is perfectly prepared
with lemon butter, pickled asparagus, and potatoes, while the baby cala-
mari in a spicy tomato sopressata sauce is delicious. The desserts, includ-
ing chocolate cake and a variety of sorbets, are excellent.

Pampano
$$$$
Midtown East
MEXICAN/SEAFOOD
Good expensive Mexican food is, in my mind, a contradiction in terms; it
should be simple, cheap, and available near a beach. Pampano, however,
and the things it does with Mexican ingredients, especially seafood, tempts
me to reconsider. Set in a lovely, lush town house, seating here is remark-
ably comfortable. But even if you were seated on a hard bench, the
seviches here would taste spectacular. For a rare and very special treat, try
a lobster taco — you won’t find anything like it at your local taqueria. Of
the entrees, the pescado azteca, bass with huitlacoche flan in a chili gua-
jillo sauce, has received raves; but you won’t suffer too much if you settle
for the very memorable pan-fried baby red snapper in a chile de arbol
sauce. Save room for arroz con leche (rice pudding) for dessert and maybe
a cleansing shot of one of the restaurant’s many excellent tequilas (if you
haven’t already downed too many margarita pampanos).

Paola’s
$$$
Upper East Side
ITALIAN
Italian restaurants are plentiful on the Upper East Side, but strength is not
always in numbers and many are mediocre at best. Paola’s is anything but
mediocre, and having survived and thrived in the neighborhood for over
two decades is testament to the restaurant’s quality and charms. The two
dining rooms are comforting and inviting; the larger of the two is centered
around a wood-burning oven used to cook many of the restaurant’s meat
dishes, and the smaller is a cozy wine room. Most appealing of all is the
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
146

menu. Pastas are usually homemade; the papardelle with a rich duck meat
ragu is a standout while the hand-rolled trofie with pesto is a Paola’s spe-
cialty. Try something roasted in the wood-burning oven such as the natu-
rally raised Cornish hens served with roasted potatoes. The poached,
port-soaked figs are the decadent way to finish.

Peter Luger Steakhouse
$$$$$
Brooklyn
STEAKHOUSE
You want one of the best steaks in New York? You gotta cross the
Williamsburg Bridge into Brooklyn to find it. It’s definitely worth the
search. And you don’t even need a jacket and tie. In fact, you can come to
Peter Luger’s any way you want — just come hungry and bring cash (no
credit cards here). This century-old institution is porterhouse heaven. The
first-rate cuts — the only ones this 121-year-old institution serves — are
dry-aged on the premises and come off the grill dripping with fat and
butter, crusty on the outside and pink within. If you really want to be fool-
ish, you can order sole or lamb chops, but why bother? The $5.95 Peter
Luger burger, however, served only at lunch, is a little-known treasure. As
sides go, the German fried potatoes are crisp and delicious, and the
creamed spinach is everything it should be.

Pho Viet Huong
$
Chinatown
VIETNAMESE
Chinatown has its own enclave of Vietnamese restaurants, and the best
among them is Pho Viet Huong. The menu is vast and needs intense perus-
ing, but your waiter will help you pare it down. The Vietnamese know soup,
and pho (a beef-based soup) is the most famous, but the hot-and-sour canh
soup, with either shrimp or fish, is also the real deal. The small portion is
more than enough for two to share, while the large is plenty for a family.
The odd pairing of barbecued beef wrapped in grape leaves is another of
the restaurant’s specialties and should not be missed. The bun, various
meats and vegetables served over rice vermicelli, are simple, hearty, and
inexpensive. You’ll even find Vietnamese sandwiches here; French bread
filled with ham, chicken, eggs, lamb, and even pâté. All of the above is best
washed down with an icy cold Saigon beer.

Family-friendly restaurants
Although it’s always smart to call ahead to make sure a restaurant has kids’ menus
and highchairs, you can count on the following restaurants to be especially accom-
modating (and find more info on each restaurant from the alphabetical list in this chap-
ter). And don’t forget pizzerias — John’s Pizzeria and Lombardi’s especially.
Choose from some of these other great options for the whole family:

Bubby’s Pie Co. (see listing in this chapter): Even the pickiest kid can find
something on this menu.

Carmine’s (see listing in this chapter): This rollicking, family-style Italian
restaurant was created with kids in mind. You won’t have to worry about
them making too much noise here.

Cowgirl, 519 Hudson St. (at West 10th Street; % 212-633-1133; www.
cowgirlnyc.com): This Western-themed restaurant is not as cheesy
as it may seem on first appearance. Kids big and small enjoy the corn
dogs, burgers, and barbecue sandwiches, served up by a slyly sassy staff.
(See the “Downtown Dining” map.)

Good Enough to Eat (see the “Breakfast and brunch” section, later in this
chapter): Kids love the comfort food, like macaroni and cheese, pizza, and
great desserts.

Mickey Mantle’s, 42 Central Park South (between Fifth and Sixth avenues;
% 212-688-7777; www.mickeymantles.com): As a player, the Mick
had a reputation for being testy with autograph hounds and children, but
he more than made up for it in retirement when he opened his extremely
kid-friendly restaurant, located just across the street from Central Park.
(See the “Midtown Dining” map.)

Ollie’s Noodle Shop, 1991 Broadway (near 68th Street; % 212-595-8181):
This bustling place serves standard Chinese fare with nothing too exotic
to challenge the kids and an extensive enough menu that even picky
eaters (like my son) find something to eat. Service is brusque but fast.
(See the “Uptown Dining” map.)

Serendipity 3 (see the “Ice cream” section, later in this chapter): Kids
love this whimsical restaurant and ice-cream shop, which serves up a
huge menu of American favorites, followed by colossal ice-cream treats.

Virgil’s Real Barbecue (see listing in this chapter): This raucous Times
Square barbecue joint is possibly one of the loudest restaurants in New
York, so the kids will fit right in.

Smörgås Chef
$$
Financial District
SCANDINAVIAN
If you’re unfamiliar with Scandinavian cuisine, Smörgås Chef provides a
graceful introduction (and one less pricey than Aquavit). Located on a cob-
blestone pedestrian street, the restaurant is part of a special row for out-
door warm-weather dining in the Financial District. Get comfortable at a
window or sidewalk table and enjoy smorbrod (open-faced sandwiches
such as Norwegian smoked salmon); Swedish meatballs with lingonber-
ries; duck breast in a cloudberry reduction, served with spaetzle; or a her-
ring sampler. The crowd is as you might expect at the heart of Wall Street,
but the side-alley feel of the street makes this a relaxed spot for lunch
when you’re exploring the Financial District. Check the Web site for pro-
motions; they occasionally offer free bottles of wine. You can find two addi-
tional locations, in Midtown at 924 Second Ave. (at 49th Street; % 212-

Soul Fixins
$
Midtown West
SOUL FOOD
Common New York wisdom holds that if you want soul food, you head
uptown to Harlem. In actuality, you don’t need to hike that far: From a store-
front in a nondescript part of Midtown, Soul Fixins has been satisfying crav-
ings for fried chicken, meatloaf, mac ’n’ cheese, candied yams, collard greens,
and sweet-potato pie for years. The menu is a bit pricey, and the sides are
sometimes better than the entrees, but it’s one of the only places in town
where I’ll even bother with the collard greens (and I’m an unrelenting snob
when it comes to greens), let alone seek them out, which I do here. If you’re
near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and you can score a seat, at
least have some sides as a snack and enjoy the Soul Fixins hospitality.

THAI
Really good Thai food is difficult to find in New York; there are plenty of
middling places and the most universally hailed spot is in Queens (if you’re

committed, it’s Sripraphai, 64-13 39th Ave., Woodside; % 718-899-9599;
Subway: 7 to Woodside–61st Street). On the island of Manhattan, Spice gets
my vote. South of Union Square, Spice pulls a young (NYU-dominated)
crowd in a mod, sun-flooded space. The menu features well-executed stan-
dards such as crispy spring rolls (with a tangy lime-mustard sauce), tom
yum soup, curries, and pad Thai, as well as specialties like crispy duck; all
are a great value. Additional locations are in Chelsea at 199 Eighth Ave.

Spice Market
$$$
Meatpacking District
ASIAN
Of all the acclaimed restaurants in celebrity chef Jean-Georges
Vongrichten’s empire, Spice Market is unquestionably the most fun. A
wide-ranging menu inspired by Asian street food plus creative cocktails
(try the Pattaya) plus attentive but nonintrusive service plus a subtropi-
cal Eastern-themed interior add up to a perfect party, whether you’re on
a date or out with a group of friends. Good luck with trying to settle on
one main dish. Do yourself a favor and opt for the $65 tasting menu, the
best way to sample an array of flavors as intended by the chef. (The $17
bento box, served from noon to 4 p.m., is a lunchtime alternative.) I can’t
get enough of the black-pepper shrimp with sun-dried pineapple or the
spiced chicken samosas. Mains include crispy salt-and-pepper skate with
Thai basil and lime; frankly, the entrees are perhaps the weakest part of
the menu. For dessert, the fudgy Ovaltine kulfi is popular, but for me, it’s
the dark-chocolate cake with ginger-snap ice cream all the way.

Strip House
$$$$
Greenwich Village
STEAKHOUSE
For enormous portions of perfectly charred and seasoned red meat in a
burlesquelike setting (complete with semi-nude, old-time stripper photos,
which adorn the red-velvet walls, roomy banquettes, and a steady flow of
lounge music), visit the appropriately named Strip House. As soon as one
of those steaks lands on your table, the semi-nudes quickly take a back
seat to the enjoyable task in front of you: devouring that meat. You’ll do
fine with the signature strip steak or the filet mignon for two, carved at
your table. The sides here are innovative variations on the standards:
creamed spinach with black truffles, french fries with herbs and garlic,

and, best of all, the crisp goose-fat potatoes. Desserts are monumental —
especially the multilayered chocolate cake — so have your waiter bring
extra forks for sharing. With the exception of those few previously men-
tioned banquettes, seating is tight so don’t expect intimacy.

Tamarind
$$$
Flatiron District
INDIAN
Inexpensive Indian restaurants, like inexpensive Mexican restaurants,
abound in Manhattan so much so that it’s often not worth splurging on a
more upscale restaurant when you can get the same-quality food at a
cheaper price. In Tamarind’s case, innovative and flavorful variations on
the old standards served flawlessly in a sleek, gallery-like setting make the
splurge definitely worth it. Adjacent to the bar is a glassed-in cubicle where
you can watch the chefs work the tandoor ovens. The breads and the
assorted crisps and noodles with sweet-and-sour chutneys make great
starters, especially when accompanied by an Indian beer. But save room
for entrees such as the Jhinga Angarey (jumbo prawns marinated in yogurt
and chilies). If you venture from the tandoor, try the lamb pasanda (apri-
cot-filled grilled lamb in a cashew and saffron sauce) or Tamarind sword-
fish marinated in tamarind chutney and fenugreek leaves. For dessert, try
the rasmalai, saffron- and cardamom-flavored cheese balls soaked in sweet
milk. I also recommend the Tea Room, next door to the main restaurant
and serving delicious sandwiches and pastry-and-tea pairings. The $15
“Tea for One” (a sandwich, pot of tea, and assorted pastries) menu makes
a peaceful midday break from sightseeing.

AUSTRIAN
If you’re planning to see a performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music,

Viennese bistro opened by chef Thomas Ferlesch (formerly of Café des
Artistes), Thomas Beisl serves delicious wiener and cod schnitzel, beef
goulash, and palatschinken both savory (crepes filled with smoked trout
and sauerkraut, served in a mushroom cream sauce) and sweet (crepes
filled with apricot jam or chocolate hazelnut). Brunch is also terrific: I
rarely stray from the French toast (it’s the only version in town I crave),
but the eggs Benedict and beef hash are popular. The service is friendly,
and it’s a great place to linger — careful not to miss your show.

Virgil’s Real Barbecue
$$$
Midtown West
BARBECUE/SOUTHERN
The pickings are slim in Times Square for decent, value-priced food, so
besides Carmine’s (see review earlier in this chapter), my suggestion for
the best bet in the area is Virgil’s. The “theme” is Southern barbecue, and
the restaurant, sprawling with dining on two levels, is made to look and
feel like a Southern roadhouse with good ol’ boy decorations on the walls
and blues on the soundtrack. But forget the theme stuff and enjoy the sur-
prisingly authentic smoked meats, especially the spice-rubbed ribs, which
are slow-cooked and meaty. For starters, the corn dogs with poblano mus-
tard are something New Yorkers rarely have the pleasure of experiencing,
and the barbecue nachos — tortilla chips slathered with melted cheese
and pulled pork — are a meal in themselves. Desserts are what you would
expect from a restaurant emulating a Southern theme: big and sweet. Try
the homemade ice-cream sandwich made with the “cookie of the day.”
Virgil’s is a great place to bring the kids; they can make as much noise as
they want here and no one will notice.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
New York is a city where everyone is constantly on the move. The pace
feels like you have just 15 minutes before your curtain goes up, the game
begins, or the tour starts. More often than not, you don’t have time to sit
down to a leisurely dinner. We’re well aware of the rush here in New
York, which is why you can find so many quick and tasty eats.
Breakfast and brunch
I’m a committed breakfast eater; even if my day doesn’t start until noon,
I have to have oatmeal or French toast before anything else. I also love
the weekend brunch ritual of meeting up with friends for a leisurely late-
morning or early-afternoon meal. Food-industry killjoys will tell you that
brunch is for suckers, a way for restaurants to charge jacked-up prices
for whipping up eggs and repackaging the week’s leftovers, but I don’t
care — the food is somewhat secondary to the social aspect in New
York. Luckily, there are many places in the city that treat both breakfast
and brunch seriously; here are a few to consider:
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
152

 Alice’s Tea Cup, 102 W. 73rd St. (% 212-799-3006): The scones
here are fantastic; the croque-monsieur and salad also make a 
delicious brunch. Be forewarned: The décor is a little . . . cutesy;
there’s a reason it’s popular for baby showers. You’ll find two more
locations, at 156 E. 64th St. (% 212-486-9200) and 220 E. 81st St.
(% 212-734-4832). (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Blue Ribbon Bakery, 35 Downing St. (at Bedford Street; % 212-
337-0404): The breads are delicious (cooked downstairs in a 150-
year-old brick oven) and the brunch is known as one of the best in
the city. The waiters are good-looking, too. Open for brunch on week-
ends from 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 Clinton St. Baking Company, 4 Clinton St. (at Houston Street; 
% 646-602-6263): The blueberry pancakes with maple butter and
the buttermilk biscuit egg sandwich are worth braving the morning
lines. Or wait until the lines subside and have them for lunch and
dinner — they’re served all day. Opens weekdays at 8 a.m. and
weekends at 10 a.m. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 Five Points, 31 Great Jones St. (between Bowery and Lafayette; 
% 212-253-5700): Lemon-ricotta pancakes, dulce de leche French
toast, eggs rancheros, and smoked salmon eggs Benedict are among
the tough choices you’ll have to make here. Open for brunch week-
ends from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 Good Enough to Eat, 483 Amsterdam Ave. (at 83rd Street; % 212-
496-0163): As much as I like breakfast, I won’t wait a long time for
it, and the wait for breakfast at this Upper West Side institution on
the weekends is utterly ridiculous and should be avoided. So go
during the week when you can gorge on pumpkin French toast or 
a Wall Street omelet with baked honey-mustard glazed ham with
Vermont sharp cheddar. Opens weekdays at 8 a.m., weekends at 
9 a.m. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Norma’s, at Le Parker Meridien hotel, 118 W. 57th St. (between
Sixth and Seventh avenues; % 212-708-7460): Norma’s is a glorious
ode to comfort food. It’s pricey but worth it for classics done with
style and creativity. And they finally took that silly $1,000 caviar-
filled omelet off the menu. Open weekdays at 6:30 a.m., weekends at
7 a.m. (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 Schiller’s Liquor Bar, 131 Rivington St. (% 212-260-4555): From
Keith McNally, the owner of the Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis, this is
a see-and-be-seen kind of brunch spot, but the food is as good as
the people-watching. Open weekdays from 11 a.m., weekends from
10 a.m. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 Veselka, 144 Second Ave. (at 9th Street; % 212-228-9682): The
Greek diner may be nearly extinct in Manhattan, but this Ukrainian
diner lives on. And we’re all grateful, because New York would not
be the same without Veselka’s buckwheat pancakes and cheese
blintzes. Open 24 hours. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)

Bagels
We take our bagels seriously in New York, and I’m as noisily opinionated
as everyone else. I like mine moist, plump, and with a generous schmear
of cream cheese. Here is a list of places to find some of New York’s best
bagels, which, of course, are the world’s best:
 Absolute Bagels, 2788 Broadway (between 107th and 108th streets;
% 212-932-2052): Their bagels, hot out of the oven, are fluffy and
melt in your mouth. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Ess-A-Bagel, 359 First Ave. (at 21st Street; % 212-260-2252; www.
ess-a-bagel.com) and 831 Third Ave. (between 50th and 51st
streets; % 212-980-1010): These are big, chewy bagels, served with
a generous amount of cream cheese — just the way I like ’em, and I
don’t pretend to understand anyone who doesn’t agree with me.
(See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 H&H Bagels, 2239 Broadway (at 80th Street; % 212-595-8003) and
639 W. 46th St. (at 12th Avenue; % 212-765-7200): The bagels here
have a loyal following, and I can admit they’re stiff competition for
Ess-a-Bagel — if only because their selection includes blueberry
bagels. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Murray’s Bagels, 500 Sixth Ave. (between 12th and 13th streets; 
% 212-462-2830; www.murraysbagels.com): There’s nothing like a
soft, warm bagel to begin your day, and Murray’s does them beauti-
fully. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
Pizza
Hear this, Chicago: Your deep-dish pizza has nothing on the delectable
thin-crusted New York variety. And even though the quality of pizza in
the city has noticeably declined, this is still where you can find the best
pizza anywhere west of Italy.
So when pizza is what you seek, search out the real deal and don’t be
tempted by the sad, soggy imitations that seem to litter every block. You
can find the best pizza in the city at:
 Grimaldi’s Pizza, 19 Old Fulton St. (between Front and Water
streets; % 718-858-4300; www.grimaldis.com): At the foot of the
Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn, the pizza made by the Grimaldis, who
have made pizzas in New York for almost 100 years, is cooked in a
coal oven and features a crisp, thin crust; homemade mozzarella;
and a rich, flavorful sauce. If you need incentive to walk across the
Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi’s is it. (See the “Brooklyn Dining” map.)
 John’s Pizzeria, 278 Bleecker St. (near Seventh Avenue; % 212-
243-1680), 260 W. 44th St. (between Broadway and Eighth Avenue;
% 212-391-7560), and 408 E. 64th St. (at First Avenue; % 212-935-
2895): Thin-crusted and out of a coal oven with the proper ratio of
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
154

tomato sauce to cheese, John’s is worthy of its loyal following. The
original Bleecker Street location is the most old-world romantic and
my personal favorite. (See the “Downtown Dining” and “Midtown
Dining” maps.)
 Lombardi’s, 32 Spring St. (between Mulberry and Mott streets; 
% 212-941-7994): Claiming to be New York’s oldest pizzeria (circa
1905), Lombardi’s still uses a generations-old Neapolitan family
recipe. The coal oven kicks out perfectly cooked pies, some topped
with ingredients such as pancetta, homemade sausage, and fresh-
shucked clams. A garden in the back makes Lombardi’s more invit-
ing during warm weather. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
The preceding pizzerias are the places to go for a pie. You will have to
look a bit harder for a good slice. If a slice is all you want, a couple of top
choices include
 Famous Joe’s Pizza, 7 Carmine St. (at Sixth Avenue; % 212-366-
1182; www.famousjoespizza.com; see the “Downtown Dining” map)
 Patsy’s Pizzeria, 2287 First Ave. (between 117th and 118th streets;
% 212-534-9783)
 Two Boots, 42 Avenue A (between 3rd and 4th streets; % 212-254-
1919; www.twoboots.com; see the “Downtown Dining” map), and
five other Manhattan locations including Grand Central Terminal
and Rockefeller Center
Hamburgers and hot dogs
While most of the country in the 1960s and 1970s was being inundated
with Golden Arches every few miles, New York proudly held out. But
then in the 1980s, the arches came, and now, just like everywhere else in
the world, they’re here to stay. But that doesn’t mean that you should
settle for what’s familiar when you can find so many better, and even
cheaper, options that aren’t affiliated fast-food chains. Check out any of
New York’s best burger joints:
 Big Nick’s Burger Joint, 2175 Broadway (at 77th Street; % 212-362-
9238): Be careful you don’t get singed as you enter Big Nick’s, where
the griddle is perilously close to the entrance and burgers are
always frying. Trying to decide whether you want your burger with
buffalo meat, turkey, or ground beef is one problem; the other is
what you want on it, because at Big Nick’s, the options are dizzying.
(See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Burger Joint, in the Le Parker Meridien hotel, 118 W. 57th St.
(between Sixth and Seventh avenues; % 212-245-5000): This clever
addition to the Le Parker Meridien hotel is hidden off the lobby by
a red curtain, but word is out about the perfect $6.50 hamburgers
sold at this real joint where it’s just burgers, fries, and beer. (See
the “Midtown Dining” map.)
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 155

 Island Burgers and Shakes, 766 Ninth Ave. (between 51st and 52nd
streets; % 212-307-7934): Not only are the burgers great (and
served in a dizzying number of varieties), but so are the grilled
chicken sandwiches and the shakes. You may not even miss the
fact that they don’t serve fries. (See “Midtown Dining” map.)
 New York Burger Co., 303 Park Ave. S. (between 23rd and 24th
streets; % 212-254-2727) and 678 Sixth Ave. (between 21st and
22nd streets; % 212-229-1404): You won’t feel guilty as you devour
the burgers at this “healthy” fast-food alternative. The beef is all-
natural Coleman beef devoid of added hormones or antibiotics and
served on a freshly baked brioche bun. The burgers have plenty of
flavor and are offered with a variety of toppings and sides. (See
“Midtown Dining” map.)
 P. J. Clarke’s, 915 Third Ave. (at 55th Street; % 212-317-1616;
www.pjclarkes.com): P. J. Clarke’s has been a Midtown institution
for over 50 years and its hamburger, like the restaurant’s old wood
walls, the broken cigarette machine and pay phone, and the hidden
dining nook for two, has been blessedly preserved. Nothing more
than a slab of chopped meat cooked to order on a bun for the curi-
ous price of $8.90, the hamburger is a masterpiece. “The Cadillac”
version adds bacon and cheese. (See “Midtown Dining” map.)
 Shake Shack, at Madison Avenue and 23rd Street (% 212-889-6600;
www.shakeshacknyc.com): Literally a shack at the southeastern
edge of Madison Square Park, this joint attracts long lines in the
warm months. Are the burgers and shakes and cheese fries worth
it? Yes — to a point. Prepare to spare at least a half-hour, or head
uptown to the new location on Columbus Avenue and 77th Street.
(See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
Can’t resist a New York City hot dog from a cart on the street? Skip the
cart and head to the Upper West Side Gray’s Papaya, 2090 Broadway 
(at 72nd Street; % 212-799-0243), for one of the cheapest meals on the
planet, the “Recession Special”: $4.50 for two beef dogs with unlimited
toppings and a fruit drink. And the good thing is that at Gray’s, there’s
always a recession. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
If you’re on the Upper East Side and yearn for a hot-dog fix, head to
Papaya King, 179 E. 86th St. (at Third Avenue; % 212-369-0648), the
poor man’s Gray’s Papaya. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
New York delicatessens
New York delis are all about pastrami and attitude. And New York has
plenty of both. Some of the best delis include the following:
 Artie’s Delicatessen, 2290 Broadway (at 83rd Street; % 212-579-
5959; www.arties.com): This newer kid on the deli block — it’s
only been open for a decade — can hold its own on the playground
with the big boys, thank you very much, especially in the Reuben
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
156

department. My corned-beef-loving mom would approve. (See the
“Uptown Dining” map.)
 Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave. (at 55th Street; % 800-334-5606 or
212-757-2245; www.carnegiedeli.com): Even big eaters may be
challenged by mammoth sandwiches with names like “Fifty Ways to
Love Your Liver” (chopped liver, hard-boiled egg, lettuce, tomato,
and onion). (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 Katz’s Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St. (at Ludlow Street; % 212-
254-2246; www.katzdeli.com): The tour buses line up outside
Katz’s for good reason: This old-world deli is one of the city’s best.
But be prepared to wait or try to hit it in the off hours. (See the
“Downtown Dining” map.)
 2nd Avenue Deli, 162 E. 33rd St. (between Lexington and Third
avenues; % 212-689-9000; www.2ndavedeli.com): This much-
beloved deli broke New Yorkers’ hearts when it closed in 2005. It
reopened further uptown (and not on Second Avenue), and you
could hear the collective sigh of relief. The sandwiches are great,
and the soups are even greater. And unlike Artie’s, Carnegie, and
Katz’s, it’s kosher. (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
More sandwiches and snacks
For other quick meals besides burgers, hot dogs, and pizza, here’s a
sampling of New York’s best places to grab and go:
 Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, 174 Fifth Ave. (between 21st and 22nd
streets; % 212-675-5096): Time seems to have slowed to a crawl in
this old-school luncheonette, where you can wash down one of the
greasy BLTs with a lime rickey. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 Empanada Mama, 763 Ninth Ave. (near 51st Street; % 212-698-
9008): This local chain offers more than 40 varieties of empanadas
(Latin American pastries). Stick to the classics, such as the
Colombian-style ground-beef corn-flour empanada. (See the
“Midtown Dining” map.)
 Shade, 241 Sullivan St. (at West 3rd St.; % 212-982-6275): New
Yorkers haven’t discovered the perfection of the crepe (and why
would they when there’s pizza by the slice, right?), but one of my
favorite treats is a salmon and roasted zucchini crepe from this
little takeaway window. Get yours and stroll over to Washington
Square Park on a sunny afternoon. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 ’wichcraft, 11 W. 40th St. (at Sixth Avenue; % 212-780-0577; www.
wichcraftnyc.com): Chef Tom Colicchio has elevated the humble
sandwich into fine dining, using fresh, local ingredients. Finish with
an “ice cream’wich.” This Bryant Park branch is just one of 11 loca-
tions in Manhattan. (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 157

Sweet treats
You now know more about my eating habits than my mother or my
doctor, but in case it’s still unclear: I am a sugar addict. I cannot pass a
day without a sweet fix. Be it ice cream, cake, or cookies, I’m like Veruca
Salt in the movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. You know, “I want
the world . . . I want the whole world,” as long as the major ingredient is
sugar. Fortunately, I live in New York, and there’s a den of dessert sin on
nearly every block. Follow me, if you will, to some of New York’s best.
Ice cream
For the best ice cream in New York, you have to travel across the
Brooklyn Bridge to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, 1 Water St. (near
Old Fulton Street; % 718-246-3963; see the “Brooklyn Dining” map), where
everything is freshly made, including the hot fudge for your sundae. For
original, exotic flavors, like Green Tea, Red Bean, and Almond Cookie —
perfect complements to a spicy Asian meal in Chinatown — head to 
the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, 65 Bayard St. (between Mott and
Elizabeth streets; % 212-608-4170; see the “Downtown Dining” map).
Jon Snyder, owner of the curiously named Il Laboratorio del Gelato,
95 Orchard St. (between Broome and Delancey streets; % 212-343-9922;
www.laboratoriodelgelato.com; see the “Downtown Dining” map),
uses only the freshest ingredients to create sweet magic in his laboratory.
People in Los Angeles lost their minds over Pinkberry, which has opened
nearly a dozen branches around New York to a more muted reception. I
know, it’s not real ice cream, but the fro-yo craze hasn’t been so hyped
since TCBY ruled the world and parachute pants were un-ironically in
style. Judge for yourself in Nolita at 41 Spring St. (% 212-274-8883; www.
pinkberry.com), near Union Square at 563 Sixth Ave. (% 212-414-8429),
or on the Upper West Side at 2041 Broadway (% 212-580-3410). (See the
“Downtown Dining” map.)
Serendipity 3, 225 E. 60th St. (between Second and Third avenues; 
% 212-838-3531; www.serendipity3.com; see the “Midtown Dining”
map), serves regular meals, but why bother when you can go right to the
restaurant’s signature dish: the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, a slushy version
of everybody’s cold-weather favorite.
Mmmm . . . hot chocolate
I eat ice cream even in the dead of winter, but some people, inexplicably,
feel that it’s meant only for hot weather. The winter alternative to ice
cream is hot chocolate, and at some bakeries and candy stores, the hot
chocolate is so good that you’ll realize that Swiss Miss is as authentic a
substitute as Spam is for Kobe steak.
One of the most sinfully rich cups in town can be found at City Bakery,
3 W. 18th St. (between Fifth and Sixth avenues; % 212-366-1414; www.
thecitybakery.com; see the “Midtown Dining” map). Stick to the shot
size; trust me, you’ll feel full for hours after drinking it. City Bakery sells
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
158

its thick hot chocolate year-round (in the summer, it’s cold hot chocolate),
and in February it hosts a Hot Chocolate Festival (www.hot-chocolate-
festival.com), featuring a new flavor every day of the month as well as
special events.
At Jacques Torres Chocolate, 60 Water St. in Brooklyn (% 718-875-9772;
www.mrchocolate.com; see the “Brooklyn Dining” map), the lines on
winter weekends begin forming at 9 a.m. Customers wait for hot choco-
late perfected by the former pastry chef of the restaurant Le Cirque. You
can choose from many varieties, but the most popular is the hot choco-
late with allspice, cinnamon, sweet ancho chili peppers, and hot chipotle
peppers.
The Chocolate Bar, 48 Eighth Ave. (between Jane and Horatio streets;
% 212-366-1541; www.chocolatebarnyc.com; see the “Downtown
Dining” map), features not only hot chocolate, but chocolate tea, and if
you can’t live without the stuff in the middle of August, iced chocolate as
well. Both Jacques Torres and the Chocolate Bar also make sinfully deli-
cious chocolates to accompany your chocolate beverage. And if that
doesn’t get you through the day, nothing will.
Baked goods
New York has no shortage of bakeries; in fact, cupcakes seem to have
replaced hot dogs as the street food of choice. The baked goods at the
Buttercup Bake Shop, 973 Second Ave. (between 51st and 52nd streets;
% 212-350-4144; see the “Midtown Dining” map) and 141 W. 72nd St.
(between Amsterdam and Columbus avenues; % 212-787-3800; see 
the “Uptown Dining” map), live up to the store’s mouthwatering name;
the vanilla cupcakes put you in a sugar coma, and the peanut-butter
bars are pretty good, too. Another favorite cupcake haven is Sugar
Sweet Sunshine, 126 Rivington St. (% 212-995-1960; www.sugarsweet
sunshine.com; see the “Downtown Dining” map), opened by a Buttercup
Bake Shop alum. I’m a stickler about red-velvet cake, and for my money,
the best is served at Billy’s Bakery, 184 Ninth Ave. (% 212-647-9956;
www.billysbakerynyc.com; see the “Midtown Dining” map); the 
cupcakes are as delicious as they look too, less cloyingly sweet than at
some other city bakeries.
If you’d like to sit down while you share a sweet thing with your 
sweet one, head to Veneiro’s, 342 E. 11th St. (% 212-674-7070; see the
“Downtown Dining” map), a traditional Italian bakery. Yes, take the can-
noli. Equally delicious is ChikaLicious, 203 E. 10th St. (between First and
Second avenues; % 212-995-9511; www.chikalicious.com; see the
“Downtown Dining” map), a more formal three-course dessert experience.
Finally, if you haven’t had a Japanese cream puff, stop into Beard Papa,
downtown at 740 Broadway (% 212-353-8888); inside Midtown’s Café
Zaiya at 18 E. 41st St. (at Fifth Avenue; % 212-779-0600); and on the
Upper West Side at 2167 Broadway (% 212-799-3770). They’re best
when they’re fresh and warm, but be careful — the cream will explode
into your mouth (and on your shirt).

Part IV
Exploring
New York City

In this part . . .
H
ow do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice,
practice . . . and the N, R, or W train! Here’s where I tell
you about the top attractions, the guided tours, and the shop-
ping scene. I also offer itineraries that guarantee a good time
based on how much time you have to spend or your interests.

Chapter 11
New York City’s Top Sights
In This Chapter
 Homing in on New York City’s top sights
 Finding the best attractions to match your interests
 Taking a guided tour by bus, by boat, or on foot
I
’m certain that I’ve seen so many of New York’s major attractions only
because I’ve lived and hosted visiting friends and family here for years.
New York offers a hundred great things to see, but you have just a few
days to hit the highlights. To get in as much as possible in the time you
have, consider these pointers:
 Visit the more popular museums and attractions as early as possi-
ble before lines begin to form. Check the hours of the attraction
and do your best to be there when it opens.
 Plan each half-day so that the sights you want to see are close by.
For example: Visit the World Trade Center site early because you
don’t have to worry about times of operation. Then walk over to
Wall Street and the Financial District, take in one of the lower
Manhattan museums, and then either walk or take a subway to
Chinatown for lunch.
 Consider a guided bus tour or a Manhattan island cruise. Most are
around three hours long, and you get a good overview of the city’s
attractions. After the tour is done and you’ve seen all the major land-
marks, you can spend more of your time concentrating on what inter-
ests you, which may include something you saw during your tour.
 Buy tickets in advance. Some attractions, like the Empire State
Building, sell tickets online. If you’re looking to save time from wait-
ing on a line, the couple of dollars for a “service charge” may be
worth it. Purchasing a CityPass saves you both money and ticket-
buying time (see the sidebar “Save time and money with CityPass,”
later in this chapter).
 Savor the outer boroughs next time. The words New York City are
often assumed to mean “Manhattan,” but Brooklyn and Queens are
destinations in their own right, and Staten Island and the Bronx
also offer worthwhile attractions. In this chapter, I cover some
major outer-borough attractions, but consider them just a sample
of what’s on offer — and plan to explore more on your next trip.

New York City’s Top Sights
American Museum of Natural History
Upper West Side
You need two hours to take in even a small sampling of this vast museum,
which spans 4 city blocks. In addition to special exhibitions (for which you
must buy tickets in advance for timed entry), the museum features a
remarkable, if somewhat dated-looking, permanent collection of taxider-
mic wildlife (including a herd of African elephants); an enormous exhibi-
tion dedicated to biodiversity; interactive exhibits; and displays of gems,
dinosaur fossils, and meteorites, among other treasures. It also has an
IMAX theater. The Hayden Planetarium — a huge sphere housed in a glass
box several stories tall — is part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space.
The top half of the sphere houses the state-of-the-art Space Theater, which
airs a breathtaking space show, Cosmic Collisions, narrated by Robert
Redford; the bottom half houses The Big Bang, a multisensory re-creation
of the first moments of the universe. If your visit is between October and
May, don’t miss the Butterfly Conservatory.
See map p. 174. Central Park West (between 77th and 81st streets). % 212-769-5100.
www.amnh.org. Subway: B, C to 81st Street/Museum of Natural History, then walk

Save time and money with CityPass
The New York CityPass (% 208-787-4300; www.citypass.com) gives you admis-
sion to six major attractions: the American Museum of Natural History and Rose Center
(including the space show in Hayden Planetarium), a Circle Line sightseeing cruise or
cruise to the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, the Empire State Building’s 86th-floor obser-
vatory, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of
Modern Art (MoMA). The pass costs $74 adults ($54 children ages 12–17), which is
around 50 percent less than you would pay if you purchased each ticket separately.
(Note that the Metropolitan has a voluntary “suggested donation” admission, so this
pass offers admission to an attraction you don’t actually have to pay for.) You can buy the
CityPass online, at the first attraction you visit, or at one of the electronic kiosks main-
tained by NYC & Company at the Visitor Information Center, 810 Seventh Ave. (between
52nd and 53rd streets), You can also pick up passes at NY SKYRIDE on the second floor
of the Empire State Building and at the Circle Line. Note that the CityPass is good for
nine days, and it doesn’t include admission to the Empire State Building’s 102nd-floor
observatory or the special exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History.

Bronx Zoo
The Bronx
With more than 4,000 animals on 265 acres, the Bronx Zoo is not only the
largest metropolitan animal park in the United States, but it’s also one of
the city’s best attractions. Visit any of the numerous exhibits scattered
throughout the zoo; the best is JungleWorld, an indoor re-creation of an
Asian rain forest, and the Monorail (Apr–Oct), which takes you on a nar-
rated ride high above free-roaming Siberian tigers, Asian elephants, Indian
rhinoceroses, and other nonnative New Yorkers. You can also visit the
Congo Gorilla Forest, home to inquisitive gorillas and other African rain-
forest animals. Also located within the zoo are a Children’s Zoo (Apr–Oct),
Butterfly Garden, camel rides, and the Zucker Bug Carousel (each an
extra charge, $2–$5).
Fordham Road and Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx. % 718-367-1010. www.bronx
zoo.com. Subway: 2 or 5 to East Tremont Avenue/West Farms Square, then walk
north to the zoo’s Asia Gate entrance. Bus: Liberty Lines’s BxM11 express bus.
Admission: $14 adults, $13 seniors, $11 children ages 3–12; free for children under 3.
Open: Nov–Mar daily 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m. (extended hours for Holiday Lights late
Nov–early Jan); Apr–Oct Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Discounted admission Nov–Mar; pay what you wish Wed year-round. Nominal addi-
tional charges may be applied for some exhibits.
Brooklyn Bridge
Downtown
With sweeping views of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the New York
Harbor, the walk across the historic stone-and-steel Brooklyn Bridge is one
of my favorite New York activities; I make a point of doing it with every
friend or family member I host in the city. Crossing takes between 20 and
40 minutes each way, depending on how long you linger to enjoy the views.
You can sit on the benches along the way if you need a break or just want
to stop for a bit to try to comprehend that you’re really in New York and
that this is not a movie set.
The perfect complement to your stroll over the Brooklyn Bridge is a stop
for delicious homemade ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory
(% 718-246-3963), located in the shadow of the bridge at the Fulton Ferry
Fire Boat House on the river. The ice cream fortifies you for your return
stroll into Manhattan.
See map p. 170. Sidewalk entrance to the Manhattan end of the bridge is on Park
Row just across from City Hall, south of Chambers Street. Subway: 4, 5, 6 to Brooklyn
Bridge/City Hall; exit across the street from the entrance. Bus: M1 (north–south bus
running down Broadway and up Center Street/Lafayette/Park and Madison avenues),
although traffic congestion makes the subway a better choice.

Central Park
Upper West Side, Upper East Side
This 843-acre refuge in the middle of the city is one of New York’s wonders.
Central Park was the first public park in the United States and is com-
pletely man-made. Throughout the year, but especially in nice weather,
Central Park is a sanctuary for Manhattanites and visitors looking for a
green escape from the pace of the city streets (though you can stay in
touch with home or office if need be — Central Park is now wireless). You
can spend hours strolling (or biking) miles of paths that wind through
acres of landscaped fields and rolling hills. The park offers pleasures for
kids of all ages: You and your children may enjoy taking a boat ride on the
lake (call Loeb Boathouse [% 212-517-2233], for rental information), skat-
ing around Wollman Rink just north of the pond (% 212-439-6900), or visi-
ting the polar bears and other animals in Central Park Zoo. I enjoy strolling
through the Conservatory Gardens in the springtime. In the summer, the
park plays host to Shakespeare in the Park and SummerStage (see Chapter
14), a series of free concerts. For information about tours, flip to “Faring
well with free walking tours,” p. 209.
Even though the park has the lowest crime rate of any of the city’s
precincts, keep your wits about you, especially in the more remote north-
ern end. You should avoid spending time in the park after dark, unless
you’re heading to one of the restaurants for dinner or to a SummerStage
or Shakespeare in the Park event.
See map p. 179. From 59th to 110th streets (between Fifth Avenue and Central Park
West, the continuation north of Eighth Avenue). Information Center: % 212-310-6600.
www.centralparknyc.org. Subway: A, B, C, D, 1 to 59th Street/Columbus Circle
for the southwest main entrance; N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street for the south-
east main entrance. Buses run along both sides of Central Park and make several
stops; the M10 runs up and down Central Park West, and the M1, M2, M3, and M4
run south down Fifth Avenue on the east side of the park (they go north on Madison
Avenue). Open: 24 hours.
Chrysler Building
Midtown East
Words can hardly express how much I love the Chrysler Building. No. 405
Lexington Avenue is one of the most stunning buildings in New York:
Topped by a shiny steel needle, with triangular windows that are illumi-
nated at night, it looks like something out of Oz. Steel sculptures are poised
on its battlements like gargoyles. It’s my personal lighthouse in the night-
time city skyline, and I get a thrill every time I see it when I return home
after a trip away. The building was designed by William Van Alen; finished
in 1930, it enjoyed the title of world’s tallest building until 1931, when the
Empire State Building was completed. The observation deck is no longer
open to the public, but peek into the lobby — an Art Deco tour de force in
chrome, wood, and marble.

See map p. 172. 405 Lexington Ave. (at 42nd Street). Subway: 4, 5, 6, 7, S to 42nd
Street/Grand Central, then follow the exit signs for Lexington Avenue, pass the bar-
rier, and take the passage in front of you toward the right, which brings you right
inside the Chrysler at the lower level; if you miss this exit, go up to street level and
cross the street walking east. Bus: M104 from the Upper West Side (runs down
Broadway and crosses town at 42nd Street) and M42 across town on 42nd Street;
both stop right in front of the building. On the east side and from downtown, take the
M101, M102, or M103 (running up Third Avenue and down Lexington Avenue).
The Cloisters
Upper Manhattan
At the north end of Manhattan in Fort Tryon Park, this museum is con-
structed from portions of medieval and early Renaissance European clois-
ters that were shipped across the Atlantic. The Cloisters houses an
important collection of medieval art, including stained glass, metalwork,
sculpture, and an impressive series of unicorn tapestries. The gardens that
hug one side of the complex authentically reproduce the herbs, flowers,
and other plants found in typical medieval cloisters. Both the museum and
the gardens have a commanding view of the Hudson River and the New
Jersey Palisades. If you choose to get here by bus, consider that, although
the bus takes you right to the museum and offers a scenic, interesting ride,
the ride is a long one (up to an hour or more, depending on where you
start, as compared to 30–45 minutes on the subway). The subway is a good
alternative; it takes you right to the entrance of Fort Tryon Park.
See map p. 181. At the north end of Fort Tryon Park, 1 block north of West 190th Street.
% 212-923-3700. www.metmuseum.org. Subway: A to 190th Street, then take the
elevator to street level (don’t walk up the long ramp — it takes you out of your way);
once outside, you see the park entrance; walk north along Fort Washington Avenue
to the entrance of Fort Tryon Park and follow the signs along the path north to the
Cloisters. Bus: The M4 (north–south bus running on Madison Avenue, 110th Street,
Broadway, Fort Washington Avenue uptown, and Fifth Avenue downtown) is very
convenient and stops right at the museum; if you’re in a hurry, you can take the
subway and then catch the bus for the last part of the run. Suggested admission: $20
adults, $15 seniors, $10 students, free for children under 12 when accompanied by an
adult; fee includes admission to the Metropolitan Museum. Open: Tues–Sun 9:30
a.m.–5:15 p.m.; Nov–Feb closes at 4:45 p.m.
Ellis Island
Downtown
From its opening in 1892 to its closing in 1954, more than 12 million immi-
grants entered the United States through the Registry Hall on Ellis Island.
After a $160-million restoration in the 1980s, it reopened as a museum dedi-
cated to the history of immigration. An enormous pile of luggage and other
personal items (children’s dolls, hairbrushes, clothing, and the like)
remind visitors of the huddled masses who passed through. Other exhibits
illustrate how these immigrants changed the demography of the United
States. The American Immigrant Wall of Honor remembers more than half

a million people who came to the U.S. in search of a better life. Ellis Island
offers an optional audio tour (narrated by Tom Brokaw) and a documen-
tary film called Island of Hope, Island of Tears. Note that a round-trip ferry
ticket to Ellis Island includes a trip to Liberty Island, the site of the Statue
of Liberty. Buying your tickets in advance online is strongly recommended;
they sell out regularly.
See map p. 170. In New York Harbor. % 212-363-3200 for general information,
877-523-9849 for ticket and ferry information. www.nps.gov/elis or  www.statue
cruises.com. Transport: Ferry from Battery Park. Subway to ferry ticket booth: 
4, 5 to Bowling Green stop, then walk through the park heading south; the ticket booth
is a little fortress at the edge of the trees by the promenade. Bus to ticket booth: M1
(running down Fifth/Park Avenue/Broadway), M6 (running down Broadway), or M15
(running down Second Avenue). Admission: Free; ferry ticket to Statue of Liberty and
Ellis Island $12 adults and children 13–17, $10 seniors, $5 children ages 4–12, free for
children under 4. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m. (extended hours in summer). Last
ferry departs at 3:30 p.m. Note that if you want to visit both Ellis Island and the Statue
of Liberty, you can’t take the last ferry; taking the last ferry enables you to visit only
one of the two attractions. Due to security restrictions, no backpacks, luggage, or
coolers are allowed.
Empire State Building
Midtown East
You can’t see King Kong dangling from the top of the Empire State Building
as he did in the 1933 and 2005 versions of King Kong, but you can get one
of the best views of Manhattan from this 1,472-foot Art Deco structure —
that is, if visibility is good. You can find a visibility rating posted in the
lobby, and you should take the rating seriously — zero visibility means
that you really won’t see a thing except clouds and fog. The observatory
is on the 86th floor and has both an outdoor and an indoor viewing area.
Huge lights glow in the top of the building and are lit up in different colors
at night in honor of various holidays. On the second floor is the NY
SKYRIDE (% 212-279-9777), a simulated aerial tour of New York, which
is worth seeing if you can’t go for the real thing.
Lines to visit the observation deck can be horrible at the concourse-level
ticket booth, so be prepared to wait — or purchase advance tickets online
using a credit card at www.esbnyc.com. You pay slightly more — tickets
were priced $2 higher on the Web site at press time — but it’s worth it,
especially if you’re visiting during busy seasons, when the line can be frus-
tratingly long. You’re not required to choose a time or date for your tick-
ets; they can be used on any regular open day. However, order them at a
computer with a printer, because only printing them online is free. If you
need them sent to you, expect to pay an additional $6 and wait seven to ten
days for the tickets to reach you ($8 and more days if you live outside the
United States). With tickets in hand, you’re allowed to proceed directly to
the second floor — past everyone who didn’t plan as well as you did!

Subway: B, D, F, N, Q, R, V, W to 34th Street/Herald Square, then walk east on 34th
Street, and turn right on Fifth Avenue to the entrance. Bus: M2, M3, M4, M5 run down
Fifth Avenue and stop right in front of the entrance. Admission to 86th-floor obser-
vatory: $19 adults, $17 seniors and children 12–17, $13 children 6–11, free for chil-
dren under 6. Open: Daily 8 a.m. to midnight. For security reasons, no backpacks or

buy tickets online with a surcharge at the Web site.
Grand Central Terminal
Midtown East
Even if you’re not catching one of the Metro-North commuter trains, make
Grand Central part of your itinerary. You count as one of the 700,000
people who pass through the terminal daily. Finished in 1913 and beauti-
fully renovated a decade ago, this Beaux Arts masterpiece features a 
12-story vibrant blue ceiling on which the stars of the zodiac are traced in
24-karat gold (accidentally done backward, as a commuter testily pointed
out when it was unveiled in 1913) and a central kiosk over which the land-
mark brass and opal clock is perched. Aside from the gorgeous main con-
course, Grand Central offers a very good dining concourse on the lower
level; top restaurants including Michael Jordan’s The Steakhouse, the
famous Oyster Bar & Restaurant; the Campbell Apartment, a glitzy bar;
and a gourmet food market, Grand Central Market. You can enjoy a guided
tour of the terminal ($10 suggested donation), given by the Municipal Art
Society (Wed 12:30 p.m.; % 212-439-1049).
See map p. 172. Main entrance on 42nd Street at Park Avenue. Subway: S, 4, 5, 6, 7
to 42nd Street/Grand Central. Bus: M1, M2, M3, M4 running up Madison Avenue;
M101, M102, M103 running down Lexington Avenue. Open: 24 hours.
Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum
Midtown West
The USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier that saw active duty in World War II, is
the focal point of this large naval museum and is now a National Historic
Landmark. The Intrepid has been closed for refurbishing but is scheduled
to reopen on Veterans Day in 2008. At press time, details were limited, but
changes to the hangar deck are expected, along with some new interac-
tive exhibits and the opening of several new areas of the ship, such as the
berthing quarters and the anchor chain room. For the kids, the Intrepid
has been like an educational amusement park with a few thrill rides.
Expect the newly renovated museum to continue that tradition.
See map p. 172. Pier 86, Hudson River at 46th Street, west of Twelfth Avenue. % 212-
245-0072. www.intrepidmuseum.org. Subway: A, C, E train to 42nd Street/Port
Authority Bus Terminal stop, and then continue west on 42nd Street for 4 blocks, or

Metropolitan Museum of Art
Upper East Side
As the largest museum in the Western Hemisphere, the Met has something
for everyone, from its world-famous Egyptian collection (and the Temple
of Dendur) to its massive holdings of American and European masterpieces
(the Impressionist works in the European-paintings section is my favorite
area) to its beautiful sculpture garden. Highlights also include the Asian
collection, the collection of musical instruments, and the armor collection;
kids love the displays in the Costume Institute on the lower level. You’re
not going to fit all this into only one visit, so try to narrow your focus before
you go. Tours of various parts of the collection are conducted several times
an hour; you also can take a self-guided audio tour or a “highlights” tour. For
schedules, check the tour bureau in the Great Hall or call % 212-570-3930.

Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
Midtown West
A two-year renovation, designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, transformed MoMA
into a 63,000-square-foot building that highlights space and light, with open
rooms, high ceilings, and gardens — a beautiful work of architecture and
a perfect complement to the art that resides within. This is where you’ll
find van Gogh’s Starry Night, Cézanne’s Bather, Picasso’s Les Demoiselles
d’Avignon, and the amazing sculpture by Rodin, Monument to Balzac. If you
haven’t guessed already, I am a bit of a design freak, so I recommend the
Architecture and Design department, with examples of design for modern
appliances, furniture, and even sports cars. MoMA also features edgy new
exhibits and a celebrated film series that attracts serious cinephiles. But
the heart of the museum, as it was before the renovation, remains the
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, which has been enlarged;
the museum’s design now affords additional views of this lovely space
from other parts of the museum.

Rockefeller Center
Midtown West
This complex of 18 buildings includes the GE building, a 70-story Art Deco
tower. The entertainment ranges from the outdoor ice-skating rink to Radio
City Music Hall, where the Rockettes perform. More than 150 shops and
restaurants are located around the plaza and under the concourse. Call
% 212-247-4777 for backstage tours, and see Chapter 14 for more infor-
mation. You can tour the NBC Studios (call % 212-664-3700 or buy tickets
on the center’s Web site), where NBC’s Today show tapes. Show up with
your WE  YOU, MATT! sign and you may get on TV. For a self-directed tour,
pick up a map at 30 Rockefeller Center; if you prefer a guided tour, call 
% 212-664-7174. During the holiday season, you can expect huge crowds
to gather and gaze upon the famous Christmas tree and the skaters on the
rink, located below at Rockefeller Plaza (% 212-332-7654) — expect long
lines on weekends to enjoy the latter. Rink admission is $10 to $14 for
adults and $7.50 to $8.50 for seniors and children under 11; skate rental is
$8. The rink is open from mid-October to mid-April.

Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
Upper East Side
Frank Lloyd Wright designed this famous museum, whose swirling, shell-
like shape reminds me of a spiraling orange peel. Inside, the exhibition
space curves in a spiral; you can take an elevator to the top and work your
way down if you don’t want to make the hike up. Exhibits change regularly
but have recently been less compelling than those at other museums such
as the Whitney or MoMA. I find the building itself to be the most interest-
ing aspect of a visit — an exterior restoration should be complete by the
time you read this — as well as the permanent collection of 19th- and 20th-
century art, which includes works by the Impressionists and founding
modernists such as Picasso. Free tours are available; check the Web site
for special events including films, concerts, and lectures.

Staten Island Ferry
Downtown
You can’t beat the price of this attraction — it’s free. And not only do you
get an hour-long excursion (round-trip) in New York Harbor, but you get
beautiful views of the Statue of Liberty. You also get to mingle with com-
muters: people who take this ferry every day to work in Manhattan. Your
journey provides great views of Ellis Island, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge,
and Governor’s Island. Returning from Staten Island, you can enjoy that
very famous view of the lower Manhattan skyline.
See map p. 170. Departs from the Whitehall Terminal at the southern tip of Manhattan.
% 718-727-2508. www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/dot. Subway: N, R to Whitehall
Street; 4, 5 to Bowling Green; 1 to South Ferry (ride in the first 5 cars). Admission:
Free. Open: 24 hours; ferries run Mon–Fri every 20–30 minutes, less frequently during
off-peak and weekend hours.
Statue of Liberty
Downtown
Lady Liberty is one of the grandest symbols of what New York and America
stand for. And it’s for that reason that the interior and base of the Statue were
closed for security measures after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
Access has improved, but it’s still limited (you can’t climb to the statue’s
crown). You can explore the Statue of Liberty Museum, peer into the inner
structure through a glass ceiling near the base of the statue, and enjoy views
from the observation deck on top of the 16-story pedestal. Whether you
choose to wander the grounds or just get a look via the Staten Island Ferry
or on your way to Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty is a must-see.

Top of the Rock
Giving the Empire State Building some friendly competition in the spectacular views
arena is the observation deck of 30 Rockefeller Plaza known as Top of the Rock. First
constructed in 1933 to invoke the grandeur of a luxury ocean liner, the 70th-floor deck
was closed in 1986 but reopened in late 2005. Though not quite as high as the Empire
State Building, the deck here is more spacious and the views just as stunning. You can
have just as much fun getting up to the observation deck as you will on the deck itself;
the glass-ceiling Sky Shuttle elevators project images from the 1930s through present
day as they zoom their way up. Reserved-time tickets help minimize the lines and are
available online. The observation deck is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to midnight (the last
shuttle to the top is at 11 p.m.); admission is $18 for adults, $16 for seniors, $11 for ages
6 to 11, and free for children under 6. For more information call % 877-692-7625 or
212-698-2000, or visit www.topoftherocknyc.com.

ticket booth: 4, 5 to Bowling Green, then walk through the park heading south; the
ticket booth is a little fortress at the edge of the trees by the promenade. Bus to ticket
booth: M1 (running down Fifth/Park Avenue/Broadway), M6 (running down
Broadway), or M15 (running down Second Avenue). Admission: Free; ferry ticket to
Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island $12 adults and children 13–17, $10 seniors, $5 chil-
dren 4–12, free for children under 4. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m. (extended hours
in summer). Last ferry departs at 3:30 p.m. Note that if you want to visit both Ellis
Island and the Statue of Liberty, you can’t take the last ferry; taking the last ferry
enables you to visit only one of the two attractions. Due to security restrictions, no
backpacks, luggage, or coolers are allowed.
Times Square
Midtown West
Times Square has evolved into something much different than it was as
recently as 15 years ago, when it had a deservedly sleazy reputation. New
Yorkers still debate about which incarnation was better. For New Yorkers,
today’s Times Square is a place we go out of our way to avoid. The crowds,
even by New York standards, are stifling; the restaurants, mostly national
chains, aren’t very good; the shops, also mostly national chains, are
unimaginative; and the attractions, like Madame Tussaud’s New York wax
museum are kitschy. Comparisons to Vegas are made, but believe me when
I say that Vegas is far more fun. Still, you’ve come all this way; you’ve got
to at least take a peek at night, if only for the amazing neon spectacle of it.
Most of the Broadway shows are centered around Times Square, so plan
your visit around your show tickets. For your pre-dinner meal, walk 2
blocks west to Ninth Avenue, where you’ll find a number of relatively inex-
pensive, good restaurants. If you’re with the kids, the Ferris wheel in the
Toys “R” Us store makes a visit to Times Square worthwhile — if the line
to ride it isn’t obnoxiously long.
See map p. 172. At the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, between 42nd
and 44th streets. www.timessquarenyc.org. Subway: 1, 2, 3, 7, N, Q, R, S, W
train to Times Square/42nd Street. Bus: M6, M7 down Seventh Avenue or M104, M10
down Broadway offer a perfect view of Times Square.
United Nations
Midtown East
A guided one-hour tour of the United Nations headquarters examines the his-
tory and purpose of the UN and takes you through the General Assembly Hall
and the Security Council Chamber. You also can walk through the grounds
and a beautiful garden (the rose garden is fantastic), which offers a view of
the East River, Roosevelt Island, and Brooklyn. The grounds feature many
sculptures that member states have given the UN, like the symbolic pistol
with a knot in the barrel, a gift from the government of Luxembourg.

visitor entrance at 46th Street. Bus: Much more convenient than the subway — take

under 5 are not allowed on the guided tours. Open: Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–4:45 p.m.; tours
every 30 minutes 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m. Call ahead for tours in languages other than
English (including Arabic, French, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish).
Wall Street and the Stock Exchange
Downtown/Wall Street
On weekdays, Wall Street offers a glimpse into the teeming world of finance
that characterizes lower Manhattan. This is where it all started; it’s the
historical heart of the city and its financial center today. See the sky-
scrapers — many among the first ever built — and throngs of people who
inhabit this world. While you’re here, visit the Museum of American
Finance, 48 Wall St. (at William Street; % 212-908-4110; Admission: $8
adults, $5 seniors and students, free for children 6 and under), which
reopened in early 2008 in a significantly larger space. The Stock Exchange
building, 11 Wall St. (% 212-656-3000), which dates from 1903, is a classi-
cal temple for dollar worship; from the observation gallery, you can watch
the world’s largest stock frenzy in action. The gallery has been closed to
the public and tours suspended indefinitely for security reasons since
September 11, 2001; you can always check to see if it has reopened, but
don’t get your hopes up.
See map p. 170. Wall Street runs between Broadway and South Street. Subway: 4, 5
train to Wall Street, or N, R to Rector Street, then walk east across Broadway to Wall
Street. Bus: M1, M6 down Broadway and up Trinity Place. Admission: Free. Open:
Call for information.
World Trade Center Site (Ground Zero)
Downtown
I would never consider a place where over 3,000 people lost their lives an
“attraction,” but I understand why visitors come to the site to pay their
respects. Over seven years and a great deal of controversy later, con-
struction is set to begin on five new skyscrapers, a memorial, and a retail
and transportation hub. The most recent reports suggests that the memo-
rial will open in 2010 and at least three of the skyscrapers will be complete
by 2012. Don’t hold your breath.
In the meantime, you can see the site from pedestrian bridges on Liberty
and Vesey streets; as the construction progresses, sidewalk views will be
more limited. The Tribute WTC Visitor Center, 120 Liberty St. (% 866-
737-1184; www.tributenyc.org), offers guided one-hour tours of the site
daily at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m., with additional tours at noon and 2 p.m.
on Saturdays, for $10 per person. Note that the walking tour is free for chil-
dren under 12, but consider carefully whether it’s appropriate for your
child to participate, given the grave and possibly upsetting subject matter.

Admission: Free.
Yankee Stadium
The Bronx
Next to the Colosseum in Rome, you’re not going to find many sports
arenas more famous than the House That Ruth Built. The Yankees play
from April until October (though, with their recent luck, not as far into Oct
as they might like). Tickets, which range in price from $14 to $400 for the
2008 season, are tough to snag, but if you plan in advance (and even if you
don’t), you should be able to score a seat by going through a broker or
scalping (be careful of forgeries) the day of a game. Expect ticket hikes
when the Yankees move into the new, smaller, stadium in 2009. (For more
information about admission to Yankees games, see “Surveying the New
York Sports Scene,” later in this chapter.)
The 2008 season was the Yankees’ last in this historic stadium, the third
largest in MLB; construction on a new stadium began in August 2006, and
the team is scheduled to start playing in its new home (just across from
the old one) in April, 2009. The new stadium will feature comfier seating,
many more dining options, and (hurrah!) more restrooms. The old stadium
is expected to be demolished to make way for parkland, but there may be
a museum on the premises. In the past there have been stadium tours in
the off-season, typically offered daily at noon except for on daytime game
day sand weekends when the team is at home.  Keep an eye on the team’s
Web site for updates on the new stadium, off-season tours, and facilities at
the old stadium site.

Other excellent museums
The Met and MoMA (see “New York City’s Top Sights,” earlier in this
chapter) are probably New York’s best-known art museums, but many,
many others are available for you to explore.
American Folk Art Museum
Midtown West
Not only is this gorgeous, ultramodern boutique museum a stunning struc-
ture, but it also heralds American folk art’s entry into the top echelon of
Chapter 11: New York City’s Top Sights 189

museum-worthy art. The modified open-plan interior features an extraor-
dinary collection of traditional works from the 18th century to the self-
taught artists and craftspeople of the present, reflecting the breadth and
vitality of the folk-art tradition. A splendid variety of quilts, in particular,
makes the textiles collection the museum’s most popular. The book and
gift shop is outstanding, filled with one-of-a-kind objects.

Brooklyn Museum of Art
Brooklyn
New York’s second-largest museum after the Met, the Brooklyn Museum
of Art is housed in a beautiful Beaux Arts building and has a collection that
includes major Egyptian and African art; in fact, it lays claim to the largest
collection of Egyptian artifacts in the world after London and Cairo. The
museum also contains important 19th-century American and European
paintings; 28 decorative art galleries and period rooms, some of them res-
cued from now-demolished historic buildings; and an important sculpture
collection, including a Rodin gallery. The museum has built a reputation
for dynamic exhibitions as well, some more hype than substance. Recent
ones have included a stunning watercolor retrospective, a respectful and
highly popular Jean-Michel Basquiat exhibition, and a somewhat contro-
versial Annie Leibovitz show. You’re not going to have any trouble getting
here, because the museum has its own subway stop. Allow at least three
hours; take some time afterward to wander through the adjacent Brooklyn
Botanic Garden (% 718-623-7200).
On the first Saturday of every month, the Brooklyn Museum of Art runs a
program from 5 to 11 p.m. that includes free admission to the museum and
a slate of live music, films, dancing, talks, and other entertainment that
can get pretty creative — think karaoke, lesbian poetry, silent films, exper-
imental jazz, and disco. As only-in–New York events go, First Saturday is
a good one — you can count on a full slate of cool.

Part of the Smithsonian Institution, the Cooper-Hewitt is in the Carnegie
Mansion, built by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in 1901. Some 11,000

engaging, and educational. Shows are both historical and contemporary
in nature. Many installations are drawn from the museum’s own vast col-
lection of industrial design, drawings, textiles, wall coverings, books, and

Upper East Side
This museum features the splendid collection of tycoon Henry Clay Frick
and is housed in his Gilded Age mansion, more or less as he organized it.
The painting collection includes works by old masters of the 16th and 17th
centuries, including Tiziano (also known as Titian), Vermeer, Rembrandt,
and El Greco, as well as 19th-century artists, including Turner and
Whistler. The furnishings and ceramic collections are also worth seeing.

This New York treasure, boasting one of the world’s most important col-
lections of original manuscripts, rare books and bindings, master draw-
ings, and personal writings was recently extensively renovated. Those
renovations include a welcoming entrance on Madison Avenue, remodeled
galleries (so that more of the library’s holdings can be exhibited), an audi-
torium, a Reading Room with greater capacity, and electronic resources
and expanded space for collections storage.

Downtown
This museum is known for its exhibitions of contemporary art, focusing
on innovative art and artists. The permanent collection includes work by
artists from around the world, ranging from installations to video, painting,
and sculpture. The museum recently moved to a new 60,000-square-foot,
$35-million home on the Bowery; it’s the first new art museum ever con-
structed from the ground up below 14th Street.

The Paley Center for Media
Midtown West
Have you ever wanted to travel back in time and “be there” during an unfor-
gettable TV or radio moment — to watch the first moon landing, or hear
Orson Welles’s War of the Worlds radio broadcast? Now you can. Formerly
known as the Museum of Television & Radio, the Paley Center has more than
140,000 radio and television programs in its permanent collection, almost all
of which are available for your viewing or listening pleasure. The museum is
more like a library; instead of wandering from one exhibit to the next, you
“check out” recordings or programs and play them in audiovisual cubicles —
anything from Sid Caesar to vintage cartoons to your favorite commercials
from childhood. Several theaters and listening rooms can accommodate large
groups for special screenings. “Exhibits” are thematic documentaries that
cover topics as diverse as Saturday Night Live film shorts and “the history of
presidential campaign advertising” (on second thought, maybe those two
topics aren’t so different after all). The place is less crowded on weekdays;
on evenings and weekends, the crowds make it hard to get a viewing booth.

Studio Museum in Harlem
Uptown
Thanks to former Whitney curator Thelma Golden, this small museum is
making a big impact with its remarkable exhibitions of black artists. Chief
curator Golden has given the museum a more international flavor, with
recent exhibits by British artist (and Giuliani offender) Chris Ofili and
African comic art creators. In 2008, a show of works by young African
artists called Flow was eagerly anticipated. The museum continues its
long-standing tradition of featuring highly respected and under-the-radar
African-American artists such as Lorna Simpson and Charles Ethan Porter.

which highlights the good, the bad, and the ugly in contemporary art. The

Whitney also has a spectacular permanent collection of modern American
art, including works by Hopper, O’Keeffe, and others. Recent exhibitions
include Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era and Kara Walker’s My

Lower East Side Tenement Museum
Downtown
This five-story tenement was home to over 10,000 people from 25 coun-
tries between 1863 and 1935. Now it’s a museum and a National Trust for
Historic Preservation. The museum tells the story of the immigration
boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the Lower East Side
was considered the “Gateway to America.” The only way to see the
museum is by guided tour and you can choose from three different ones;
the best is the one-hour Confino Living History Tour, given on weekends
only. To ensure a spot, purchase your tickets early at % 800-811-4111 or

Museum of Jewish Heritage — A Living Memorial to 
the Holocaust
Downtown
This spare, six-sided building with a six-tier roof, alluding to the Star of
David and the six million people murdered in the Holocaust, recounts the
unforgettable horror yet tenacious renewal of Jews from the late 19th cen-
tury to the present. Through objects, photographs, documents, and video-
taped testimonies, the museum tells a very powerful story of survival and
faith. Recent special exhibitions include Shalom Y’All: Images of Jewish Life
in the American South and The Other Promised Land: Vacationing, Identity,
and the Jewish-American Dream.

Notable New York City architecture
You can walk the city streets with your eyes skyward and your mouth
open over some of the magnificent structures scattered throughout the
city. The Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building are two of the
most famous buildings in New York and are also top sights (see their list-
ings earlier in this chapter). But you may want to gawk at some of these
other structures, too.
Flatiron Building
Flatiron District
The Flatiron Building (its original name was the Fuller Building) takes its
name from its unusual triangular shape. Built in 1902, it was one of the first
skyscrapers in Manhattan. Although only 20 stories tall, it’s one of the
most recognized and unique buildings in the city (though it didn’t stop
retailer H&M from temporarily mounting a 15-story ad on the side a couple
of years ago, to the ire of New Yorkers and the city’s Department of
Buildings). Now, the area surrounding the building, which features a
number of publishing houses and modeling agencies, is known as the
Flatiron District.
See map p. 172. 175 Fifth Ave. (where Fifth Avenue and Broadway cross at 23rd
Street). Subway: N, R train to 23rd Street. Bus: M6 and M7 down Broadway or M2,
M3, M5 down Fifth Avenue for a magnificent view of the building; the buses stop right
there, too.
New York Public Library
Midtown West
With its white Corinthian columns, allegorical statues, and the world-
famous lion sculptures (their names are Patience and Fortitude) at the
entrance, the New York Public Library’s Humanities & Social Sciences
Library is one of the country’s finest examples of Beaux Arts architecture.
I did a semester-long practicum here (you didn’t know you were taking
travel advice from a degreed librarian, did you?), and showing up to work
never dulled the joy of approaching the entrance. Oh, and you can find a
lot of good books inside, too. Don’t miss the Rose Reading Room, and take
some time to check out whatever special exhibit is on display — it’s always
Chapter 11: New York City’s Top Sights 195

worthwhile. After a $5-million restoration, what was once known only as
Room 117, a Beaux Arts masterpiece with incredible views of Fifth Avenue
and 42nd Street, reopened in late 2005 and is now known as the Lionel
Pincus and Princess Firyal Map Division; here you’ll find possibly the finest
and most extensive collection of maps in the world.

Skyscraper Museum
Financial District
This museum features those structures that you’ve craned your neck to
get a good look at, and it’s the first of its kind. Located in the 38-story
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill tower that also houses the Ritz-Carlton New
York, Battery Park, the space comprises two galleries: one housing a per-
manent exhibition dedicated to the evolution of Manhattan’s commercial
skyline, the other available for changing shows.

Open: Wed–Sun noon to 6 p.m.
U.S. Customs House
Downtown
This 1907 National Historic Landmark houses the National Museum of the
American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center. The granite structure fea-
tures giant statues carved by Daniel Chester French (of Lincoln Memorial
fame); the statues lining the front personify Asia (pondering philosophi-
cally), America (bright-eyed and bushy-tailed), Europe (decadent, whose
time has passed), and Africa (sleeping). Inside, the airy oval rotunda,
designed by Spanish engineer Raphael Guastavino, was frescoed by
Reginald Marsh to glorify the shipping industry (and, by extension, the
Customs office once housed here).

Woolworth Building
Downtown
Completed in 1913, the Woolworth was the tallest building in the world for
a time. Designed by architect Cass Gilbert, the Gothic tower is known for
its beautifully decorated interior and exterior. Mr. Woolworth paid $15.5
million cash for the structure, and it shows. Besides the stunning exterior,
this building — once known as “The Cathedral of Commerce” — has gor-
geous mosaic ceilings, a marble staircase, and statues of people involved

in the building’s construction. Enjoy it from the outside; because of height-
ened security, the public is no longer allowed inside.

to Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall, then walk west across the park.
Beautiful places of worship
New York is a city known for its religious tolerance. Places of worship for
just about every denomination are everywhere, and many are housed in
remarkable structures worth checking out even if religion is not what
you came to New York to get.
Abyssinian Baptist Church
Harlem
This Baptist church, founded in 1808 by African-American and Ethiopian
merchants, is the most famous of Harlem’s 400-plus houses of worship.
The chamber of commerce has declared the church a “Living Treasure.”
Come for Sunday morning services at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. to get a sample of
the Harlem gospel tradition.

Subway: 2, 3, B, C to 135th Street.
Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine
Upper West Side
Towering over Amsterdam Avenue near the edge of Harlem is an unlikely
sight: the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. The cathedral, begun in
1892, is still only two-thirds complete; the towers, transepts, choir roof,
and other aspects remain unfinished. The architects and builders have
continually employed Gothic engineering, stone-cutting, and carving tech-
niques. Numerous chapels throughout the cathedral commemorate vari-
ous ethnic groups and traditions. You can visit the towers on Saturdays.
Three services per day are held during the week (8 a.m., 12:15 p.m., and
5:30 p.m.), and four are held on Sunday (8 a.m., 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 6 p.m.).
The cathedral hosts numerous concerts, including dance, choir, and clas-
sical music performances. But by far the most unforgettable special event
is the Blessing of the Animals, held in early October as part of the Feast
of St. Francis of Assisi. A procession of critters — everything from dogs
and cats to camels and elephants — parades through the church; each is
blessed in honor of St. Francis, the patron saint of animals. Call 212-
316-7540 for tickets; advance reservations are necessary for this popular
event.

St. Patrick’s Cathedral
Midtown East
St. Patrick’s, the largest Catholic cathedral in the United States, features
Gothic spires, beautiful stained-glass windows, and an impressive white-
marble facade. Mass is held seven times a day Sunday through Friday and
three times a day on Saturday. It’s a calm island in a busy thoroughfare,
across from Rockefeller Center and next door to Saks Fifth Avenue.

Trinity Church
Downtown
This Wall Street house of worship — with neo-Gothic flying buttresses,
beautiful stained-glass windows, and vaulted ceilings — was designed and
consecrated in 1846. The historic Episcopal church stood strong while
office towers crumbled around it on September 11, 2001; however, the his-
toric pipe organ was damaged by dust and debris, and it was replaced by
a digital organ in 2003. The gates to the historic church served as an
impromptu memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack, with countless
tokens of remembrance left by both locals and visitors alike.
Also part of Trinity Church is St. Paul’s Chapel at Broadway and Fulton
Street, New York’s only surviving pre-Revolutionary church and a transi-
tion shelter for homeless men.

Paul’s Chapel, between Vesey and Fulton streets).
Especially for kids
New York has plenty of attractions that you can enjoy with your chil-
dren, and some of the city’s top sites, like the Bronx Zoo, Central Park,
and the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum (see “New York City’s Top
Sights,” earlier in this chapter), appeal especially to kids. Check out
these other kid-friendly attractions.
The Children’s Museum of Manhattan

Its five floors include a Dora the Explorer–themed section; PlayWorks,

The museum features special exhibits, such as Gods, Myths, and Mortals:
Discover Ancient Greece, complete with a giant Trojan Horse for climbing.
I don’t think the admission price is worth it if your child is under age 2,
however. Allow at least two hours.

Housed in a three-story 1904 firehouse, the former quarters of FDNY
Engine Co. 30, this museum houses one of the country’s most extensive
collections of fire-service memorabilia from the 18th century to the pres-
ent. Displays range from vintage fire marks to fire trucks (including the
last-known example of a 1921 pumper) to the gear and tools of modern
firefighters. Best of all, real firefighters are almost always on hand to share
stories and fire-safety information with kids. The retail store sells author-
ized FDNY logo wear and souvenirs.

at groundbreaking (Mar 24, 1900) to the present. Kids can enjoy the inter-
active elements and the vintage subway cars, old wooden turnstiles, and

South Street Seaport and Museum
Downtown
The whole Seaport neighborhood is an important historical landmark that
has been restored, in part by the South Street Seaport Museum and in part
by private businesses. This attraction offers a look at commerce in the
past and in the present. The Seaport’s cobbled streets and restored brick
buildings house many interesting shops (including Bowne & Co.
Stationers, a 19th-century letterpress print shop still in operation at 211
Water St.), and two warehouses from the days when sailing ships ruled
trade now contain indoor shopping complexes and fine restaurants. On
the waterside, the museum has completed the restoration of a number of
historical ships, including the Peking, an enormous four-master built of
steel; the Ambrose, a lightship; and the Lettie G. Howard, a fishing schooner.
One of the restored ships, the W. O. Decker, a cute wooden tugboat, takes
people out for tours of the harbor on Saturdays from May to October.
At Pier 17 of the Seaport, on the third floor there, two rows of deck chairs
line the south terrace and overlook the water. These chairs are a great
place to relax and take in the view of Brooklyn, the bridges, and New York
Harbor. On weekends, though, the seats fill up fast.

New York City for teens
Don’t underestimate the interests of teenagers; I know many who are much
more adult than I am. On the other hand, I know a few who tend toward the
infantile. So what appeals to both adults and kids probably also appeals to
teens. Still, don’t forget these options that may go over well with the teens.
Museum of the Moving Image
Queens
Is there a teenager who doesn’t like going to the movies? I don’t think so,
which is why this movie-lovers’ museum is also perfect for teens. Behind
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
200

the Screen, the museum’s permanent exhibit, is an interactive installation
that takes you step-by-step through the process of moviemaking. The
museum houses more than 1,000 artifacts, from technological gadgetry to
costumes, and exhibits where you can try your own hand at sound-effects
editing or create your own animated shorts, among other simulations.
Teens (and overgrown teens disguised as adults, like me) also love the
popular Digital Play exhibit of vintage, playable video games such as
Donkey Kong. Film nuts should keep an eye on the calendar of programs,
which has recently included conversations with directors including Wong
Kar-wai and George Romero and screenings of cult gems such as The Last
Dragon (with a personal appearance by the star, Taimak!). If I sound overly
enthusiastic about the museum (not to mention Taimak), it’s for good
reason; check it out. Note: The museum is closed for a major expansion at
press time, and is scheduled to reopen in mid- to late 2009; check the Web
site for updates and for museum programs offered in alternate venues
during the renovation.

Fun for TV fans
With all the sitcoms, crime series, and talk shows based in New York, the
city often feels like one big set. If applauding on cue is what you’d like to
do while you’re visiting the city, check out these major shows where you
can do just that.
One TV show you won’t need a ticket for is the Today show. All you have
to do to see Matt, Meredith, Al, and Ann is get up early and join the
crowd outside the Rockefeller Center studio on 49th Street between Fifth
and Sixth avenues. (The show schedules more out-of-doors segments in
warmer weather, including the Friday Summer Concert Series.) You have
a good chance of getting on camera if:
 You’re holding up a creative sign.
 You want to propose to your significant other on the air.
 You show up and stick around during some really bad weather.
For the shows listed here, it’s a good idea to arrange for tickets as far in
advance of your trip as possible — I’m talking six months or more. Tickets
are always free. For more information about getting tickets to TV tapings,
contact NYC & Company (% 212-484-1222; www.nycvisit.com).
 The Daily Show with Jon Stewart: Comedy Central’s half-hour
humor and news show tapes Monday through Thursday at 5:45
p.m.; the studio is at 513 W. 54th St. Tapings are often booked solid
even a year out, but you can try your luck with the show’s online
reservation system at www.thedailyshow.com/tickets.jhtml.
Arrive early even if you have tickets; the show is often overbooked
and ticket-holders may be invited to come back on another day.
 The Late Show with David Letterman: Dave’s is the hardest TV
ticket in town to score and no longer takes written requests via
mail. You can fill out a form on the Web site (www.cbs.com/
latenight/lateshow) to be put on a list for last-minute cancella-
tion tickets (last-minute in this case being three months or sooner).
You must be 18 years or older to attend. Standby tickets are avail-
able only by phone, starting at 11 a.m. on taping day; call % 212-

tickets are hard to come by — you’re looking at a year’s wait — but
if you didn’t plan far enough ahead, you might try snagging same-
day tickets. If you’re determined, go early (like 7 a.m.) to the corner
of 67th Street and Columbus Avenue for a standby number, and
then wait to see if you score a seat. No one under 10 is admitted,
and children ages 10 to 18 can only attend with an adult. To request
tickets, send a postcard to Live with Regis and Kelly Tickets, Ansonia
Station, P.O. Box 230-77, New York, NY 10023. Include alternate
dates to improve your chances of getting in.
 Saturday Night Live: SNL has enjoyed a resurgence, making
tickets harder than usual to obtain. The show starts on Saturday at
11:30 p.m. (arrive by 10 p.m.), with a dress rehearsal at 8 p.m.
(arrive by 7 p.m.). No one under 16 is admitted. Ticket requests are
processed only during the month of August; send a single e-mail (in
Aug only) to snltickets@nbc.com. Tickets (two per request) are
awarded by lottery. For standby tickets, arrive no later than 7 a.m.
on taping day (and wait under the NBC Studios marquee at the 49th
Street entrance of 30 Rockefeller Plaza). You can try for a standby
ticket for the 8 p.m. dress rehearsal or for the 11:30 p.m. live show.
Only one ticket is issued per person.
Don’t forget to stop by the Paley Center for Media. See the listing in the
“Finding More Cool Things to See and Do” section, earlier in this chapter.
Surveying the New York Sports Scene
You can get a real feel for New Yorkers when you watch their hometown
teams. Sitting in the bleachers or nosebleed seats at Yankee Stadium or
Madison Square Garden is a (cheap) thrill, and the minor-league teams
are a hit in the big city.
Yankees and Mets: Major leaguers
With two baseball teams in town, you can catch a game almost any day
from opening day in April to the beginning of the playoffs in October.
(Don’t bother trying to get subway-series tix, though — they’re the
hottest seats in town. Ditto for opening day or any playoff game.)
The Amazin’ Mets play at Shea Stadium in Queens (Subway: 7 to Willets
Point/Shea Stadium). In 2009, however, they’re expected to move to their
brand-new home, Citi Field; for updates, check http://newyork.mets.
mlb.com (click on “Shea Stadium/Citi Field”). For tickets (which ran
$5–$117 for regular-season games in the 2008 season) and information,
call the Mets Ticket Office at % 718-507-TIXX or visit www.mets.com.
The Bronx Bombers, also known as the Yankees, haven’t made it to the
World Series since 2003, but they’re still a hot ticket. The Yanks play at the
House That Ruth Built, Yankee Stadium (Subway: C, D, 4 to 161st Street/
Yankee Stadium), through 2008; in 2009, they’re set to move to a brand-
Chapter 11: New York City’s Top Sights 203

spanking-new facility next door. For tickets ($14–$400 in 2008), contact
Ticketmaster (% 212-307-1212 or 212-307-7171; www.ticketmaster.
com) or Yankee Stadium (% 718-293-6000; www.yankees.com). Most 
of the expensive seats (field boxes) are sold out in advance to season-
ticket holders. You can often purchase these very same seats from
scalpers, but you’ll pay a premium for them. Bleacher seats (the cheap-
est) are sold the day of the game.
Down on the farm in New York: The minors
The Brooklyn Cyclones, the New York Mets’ A-level farm team, and the
Staten Island Yankees, the Yanks’ junior leaguers, both play in sparkling,
picturesque stadiums. What’s more, with bargain-basement ticket prices,
these teams offer a great way to experience baseball in the city for a
fraction of the major-league hassle and cost. Both teams have already
developed a rabidly loyal fan base, so it’s a good idea to buy your tickets
in advance, rather than just head to the ballpark.
The Cyclones have been a major factor in the revitalization of Coney
Island; Keyspan Park sits right off the legendary boardwalk (Subway: 
D, F, N, Q to Stillwell Avenue/Coney Island). For Cyclones info and tick-
ets, call % 718-449-8497 or visit www.brooklyncyclones.com.
The SI Yanks play at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark, just a five-
minute walk from the Staten Island Ferry terminal (Subway: N, R to
Whitehall Street; 4, 5 to Bowling Green; 1 to South Ferry). To reach the SI
Yanks, call % 718-720-9200 or go online to www.siyanks.com.
The city game: Basketball
Though the New Jersey Nets (www.njnets.com) are expected to be
moving to Brooklyn eventually (as early as 2009 if construction on the
new Brooklyn arena is completed), two pro teams now play in New York
at Madison Square Garden (Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd
streets; % 212-465-6741; www.thegarden.com; % 212-307-7171 or
www.ticketmaster.com for tickets; Subway: A, C, E, 1, 2, 3, 9 to 34th
Street). MSG is the home court for the painfully dysfunctional New York
Knicks (% 877-695-3865 or 212-465-5867; www.nyknicks.com). It’s 
also the home court for the New York Liberty (% 212-465-6080; www.
nyliberty.com), who electrify fans each summer with their tough-
playing defense.
Back on the ice: NHL action
The New York Rangers also play at Madison Square Garden (Seventh
Avenue between 31st and 33rd streets; % 212-465-6741; www.newyork
rangers.com or www.thegarden.com; Subway: A, C, E, 1, 2, 3 to 34th
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
204

Street). The struggling Rangers have been on an upswing, and tickets 
are hard to get, so plan well ahead; call % 212-307-7171 or visit www.
ticketmaster.com for online orders.
Madison Square Garden is set to undergo a massive renovation during
2009–2010, though management says that the Knicks’ and the Rangers’
seasons will not be disrupted, though the Liberty will be displaced.
Seeing New York by Guided Tour
If your time is limited and you want an overview of the city’s highlights,
a guided tour is the way to go. Also, because New York has tours for just
about every interest, you’re sure to find one that fits your needs. In this
section, I listed some of the best tours in the city.
If you decide to take a group tour, ask about group size when you call to
reserve your spot. Generally, you want as small a group as possible to
minimize the time required to get organized and move around.
Seeing the city by tour bus
Several companies offer very general city sightseeing tours, many on
double-decker buses. These tours are fine for seeing the sights and ori-
enting yourself to the city, but don’t expect too much from the running
commentary.
Gray Line New York Tours (% 800-669-0051 or 212-397-2600; www.
graylinenewyork.com). Gray Line offers just about every sightseeing
tour option and combination you could want. You can take a bus tour 
by day and by night; uptown, downtown, all around town, and out of
town, as well as bus combos with Circle Line cruises, helicopter flights,
museum admittance, and guided visits of sights. I don’t think you need
to purchase some combination tours — you don’t need a guide to take
you to the Statue of Liberty, and you don’t save any money on admission
by buying the combo ticket. I’ve found that the Gray Line puts a higher
premium on accuracy than the other big tour-bus operators, so this is
your best bet among the biggies. The All Loop tour is $50 for adults and
$40 for children 3 to 11; buying the tickets online will save you $5.
Although they aren’t tour buses, public buses crisscross the city. If
having a tour guide isn’t essential, consider taking advantage of the 
$2 tour that the buses afford. Try the M1 all the way down Fifth Avenue
from Museum Mile to 42nd Street; then change to the M104 and go
across to Times Square, up Broadway through the Theater District, past
Lincoln Center, and on to the Upper West Side. Or take the M5 down
Fifth Avenue from Central Park South to Greenwich Village.
Chapter 11: New York City’s Top Sights 205

Cruising around the island
 Bateaux New York (% 866-817-3463; www.bateauxnewyork.com)
offers gourmet lunch and dinner cruises under a glass dome: The
ship has a glass top with a special anti-fog system and is climate
controlled, making the evening cruises quite romantic. The three-
hour dinner cruise sails down the Hudson River and around to the
East River and back, passing by the Statue of Liberty ($120–$133).
Jackets and ties suggested for men. Board 30 minutes before depar-
ture from Pier 61 at Chelsea Piers. Via the subway, take the C or E
train to 23rd Street and then the westbound M23 bus on 23rd
Street. (See the “Midtown Attractions” map.)
 Circle Line (% 212-563-3200; www.circleline42.com) offers the
famous Full Island Cruise, which sails around Manhattan in three
hours (daily Mar–Dec; $30 adults, $25 seniors, $17 children). The
cruise leaves from Pier 83 at West 42nd Street and Twelfth Avenue.
You see Manhattan from both sides, go under the George Washington
Bridge, and pass down through Hell Gate, the murky, swirling spot
where the East River and the Harlem River meet. Departing from
the same location, Circle Line also offers a shorter cruise, which
goes back and forth around the lower half of Manhattan and lasts
two hours (daily Mar–Sept; $25 adults, $21 seniors, $14 children);
and a Harbor Lights cruise, also a two-hour cruise (at dusk, call for
precise schedule; $25 adults, $21 seniors, $14 children). From Pier
16 at the South Street Seaport, Circle Line has 75-minute Liberty
cruise to see the Lady and the harbor (daily Apr–Oct; $20 adults,
$17 seniors, $12 children). Allow up to 45 minutes for ticketing and
boarding.
To get to Pier 83 via the subway, take the A, C, or E train to Port
Authority or the N, Q, R, S, 1, 2, 3, or 7 to Times Square, and then
take the M42 bus westbound on 42nd Street or walk west to Twelfth
Avenue. To reach Pier 16 via the subway, take the 1, 2, 4, 5, A, C, J,

Transportation alternatives
You really don’t want to burden that nag with a carriage ride through Central Park in
the middle of the summer, do you? Better you should hire a real beast of burden: a
driver of a pedicab who probably really needs the money. Pedicabs are common sights
on the streets of New York. The drivers are friendly, informative, and don’t litter the
streets. Manhattan Pedicab, Inc. (% 212-586-9486), one of the two primary pedicab
companies, charges $40 for a half-hour, $75 for a full hour, and $20 (minimum) for 
an impromptu street pickup. Tours are also available, including Upper East Side and
Upper West Side Bar and Restaurant Tours, and a Central Park–Rockefeller Center
Tour. Another option is the Manhattan Rickshaw Company (% 212-604-4729;
www.manhattanrickshaw.com), whose fares range from $15 to $30 (and up).

M, or Z to Fulton Street/Broadway Nassau and then walk east to the
Seaport. (See the “Midtown Attractions” map.)
 New York Waterways (% 800-533-3779; www.nywaterway.com),
the nation’s largest privately held ferry service and cruise operator,
also does the 35 miles around Manhattan but does it on faster cata-
maran boats, passing by all the same sights as the Circle Line in
only two hours. They also offer a variety of sightseeing options,
including an architecture cruise, a leaf-peepin’ cruise, and a sunset
cruise. The 90-minute Skyline Cruise departs from Pier 78 and
focuses on Midtown and downtown Manhattan (daily year-round,
but on a reduced schedule Jan–Feb, so call for info; $26 adults, $21
seniors, $15 children 3–12).
To reach Pier 78, take the free shuttle (blue, red, and white; it stops
at regular city bus stops and you hail it as a cab) that runs along
57th, 49th, 42nd, and 34th streets and up and down 12th Avenue; or
take the hotel bus that runs twice a day (call for route and sched-
ule). (See the “Midtown Attractions” map.)
 Spirit Cruises (% 866-483-3866; www.spiritcruises.com) runs
year-round cabaret-style cruises, including a two-hour lunch cruise
(with a narrated tour of the harbor and a buffet lunch; ranging from
$40 weekdays January–Mar to $53 weekends Apr–Dec) and a three-
hour dinner sunset cruise (with live music and a buffet; from $130
weekdays Jan–Mar up to $176 Sat Apr–Dec). Prices include taxes
and service. Cruises board 30 minutes before departure from Pier
61 at Chelsea Piers. To get there via the subway, take the C or E
train to 23rd Street and then take the westbound M23 bus on 23rd
Street.
Flying high with helicopter tours
If you can afford it, a helicopter tour is something you absolutely shouldn’t 
miss. For a breathtaking tour, try Liberty Helicopters (% 212-967-
6464; www.libertyhelicopters.com), which offers several packages
from $75 up to $204. Liberty runs several tours every day, and reserva-
tions are necessary only for groups of three people or more. The heli-
copters can hold up to six people. Note that tours are very short — from
about 10 to 20 minutes. The tours start both from the VIP Heliport at
West 30th Street and 12th Avenue and from the Downtown Manhattan
Heliport at Pier 6 and the East River (4 blocks south of Wall Street).
To get to the VIP Heliport by subway, take the A, C, or E train to Penn
Station, and then walk (or take the M34 crosstown bus) 4 blocks west on
34th Street, turn left on 12th Avenue, and walk 2 blocks south. To reach
the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, take the 1 train to South Ferry, walk
northeast on South Street for approximately 4 blocks to the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, and turn right toward the water.
You’ll be asked to present identification before boarding a helicopter
tour, so make sure you have your driver’s license or passport with you.
Chapter 11: New York City’s Top Sights 207

Broadening your mind with specialty tours
 Adventures on a Shoestring (% 212-265-2663) is one of the earli-
est entrants into the booming walking tour market. Host Howard
Goldberg has provided unique views of New York since 1963,
exploring New York with a breezy, man-of-the-people style. Tours
focus on behind-the-scenes views of neighborhoods. A variety of
Greenwich Village tours emphasize the haunted, the picturesque,
and the historic; the Historic Roosevelt Island tour includes taking
the Roosevelt Island Tram. He even does theme walks, such as
“Marilyn Monroe’s Manhattan” and a “Salute to Katharine Hepburn.”
Tours are a bargain at $5 for 90 minutes and are given 12 months a
year, rain or shine.
 Joyce Gold History Tours of New York (% 212-242-5762; www.
nyctours.com) features weekend walking tours of neighborhoods
all over Manhattan, going everywhere from Harlem to Wall Street.
Gold teaches New York City history at New York University and the
New School. Tours are conducted on weekends from March to
December and cost $15 ($12 for seniors).
 The Municipal Art Society (% 212-439-1049 or 212-935-3960;
www.mas.org) offers excellent historical and architectural walking
tours aimed at individualistic travelers. Each tour is led by a highly
qualified guide who gives insight into the significance of buildings,
neighborhoods, and history. Topics range from the urban history of
Greenwich Village to “In the Shadow of the High Line,” a new public
park on former elevated subway tracks. Walking tours are $15.
Reservations may be required depending on the tour, so it’s best to
call ahead. A full schedule is also available online.
 NYC Discovery Tours (% 212-465-3331) offers more than 70 tours
of the Big Apple, divided into five categories: neighborhood (includ-
ing “Central Park” and “The Harlem You Never Knew”); theme (such
as “Academy Award Weekend Famous Movie Sites”); biography
(“John Lennon’s New York”); tavern/food tasting (“Chinatown
History and Tasting Tour”); and American history and literature
(“The Charles Dickens Tours”). Tours are about two hours long and
usually cost $15 per person (more for food tastings or drinks).
Biking, singing, eating and all that jazz tours
 Big Apple Jazz Tours (% 212-283-5299), hosted by New York Jazz
expert Gordon Polatnick, is the real deal for jazz buffs. Polatnick’s
tours are small (three to ten people), and he bases the destinations
on the jazz interests of his clients. If you’re into bebop, he shows
you Minton’s Playhouse, the still-standing but now defunct jazz
club that was the supposed birthplace of bop. From there he takes
you to other, active Harlem clubs that he feels embody Minton’s
bebop spirit. If you’re into the bohemian Village scene, he takes
you to clubs that represent that era. The tour is $300 ($75/hour for
four hours); the price does not include transportation.
Part IV: Exploring New York City

 Bike the Big Apple (% 201-837-1133; www.bikethebigapple.
com) offers guided half-day, full-day, and customized bike tours

but little-explored Upper Manhattan and Harlem. You don’t have to
be an Ironman candidate to participate; tours are designed for the
average rider with an emphasis on safety and fun. Shorter (approxi-
mately 21⁄2 hours) and longer versions (around 5 hours) are avail-
able. Tours are offered year-round; prices run from $70 to $80 and
include a bike and all gear.
 Harlem Spirituals Tours (% 800-660-2166 or 212-391-0900;

the Web site at least a month before your trip; mention your lan-
guage needs (at last count, 22 languages can be accommodated)

Shopping in New York City
In This Chapter
 Scoping out the shopping scene
 Going big name hunting
 Discovering the best buys in different neighborhoods
 Finding the most interesting stores
E
ven if you came to New York to see the sights, chances are you also
want to explore the city’s amazing shopping possibilities, if only for
a souvenir of your trip or a gift. When it comes to shopping, you can’t do
better than New York. This chapter gives you a starting point from which
you can begin your New York shopping adventure.
Surveying the Shopping Scene
First, you need to know that shopping hours depend on the type of
store, time of year (such as the holiday season), and day of the week
(some stores extend their hours on Thurs but shorten them on Sun and
even Sat). Most department stores are open Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. The open
hours of shops and boutiques vary widely, and the only way to know for
certain is to call the store you want to visit.
Another happy note is that New York sales tax (8.375 percent) is not
added to clothing and footwear items. That’s right: Your Chip & Pepper
jeans, bespoke suit, and Kenneth Cole shoes all can be purchased tax-
free. Your shopping dollars go farther here, without resorting to having
to ship your purchases directly home to avoid the sales tax.
If you’re on the hunt for a specific item that I don’t mention in this chap-
ter, two excellent resources for shopping information are the weekly
magazines New York (www.nymetro.com), which spotlights “sample”
sales (see the “Scoring at the sample sales” sidebar, later in this chap-
ter), and Time Out New York (www.timeoutny.com).

Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 217

Knowing the Big Names
The names that follow are surely familiar to shopaholics, but for many
others (also known as the low-maintenance types), this list helps you get
to know some of the biggest and best-known of the New York stores.
 Barneys, 660 Madison Ave. (at 61st Street; % 212-826-8900;
www.barneys.com; Subway: N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street;
see the “Uptown Shopping” map): This store sets the tone for
upscale chic for both men and women. Barneys CO-OP is a fashion
hot spot with its own strong identity, separate from the chic
Madison Avenue headquarters; there are three locations: down-
town in Chelsea at 236 W. 18th St. (between Seventh and Eighth
avenues; % 212-593-7800; Subway: 1 to 18th Street), in SoHo at 116
Wooster St. (between Spring and Prince streets; % 212-965-9964;
Subway: N, R to Prince Street), and uptown on the Upper West Side
at 2151 Broadway (between 75th and 76th streets; % 646-335-0978;
Subway: 1 to 79th Street).
Twice a year, Barneys hosts its famous warehouse sale in its ware-
house facility in Chelsea at 255 W. 17th St. (between Seventh and
Eighth avenues; % 212-450-8400). Prices change daily, but mark-
downs are 50 percent to 75 percent off the original retail prices on
all clothing and gifts. If you’re planning a shopping trip to the city,
check the Barneys Web site to find out when these sales occur.
 Bergdorf Goodman, 754 Fifth Ave. (at 57th Street; % 212-753-7300;
www.bergdorfgoodman.com; Subway: N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th
Street) and Bergdorf Goodman Men, 745 Fifth Ave.: Bergdorf’s rep-
resents the pinnacle of exclusive shopping, with prices to match.
 Bloomingdales, 1000 Third Ave. (at 59th Street; % 212-705-2000;
www.bloomingdales.com; Subway: 4, 5, 6 to 59th Street, or N, R, 
W to Lexington Avenue/59th Street; see the “Midtown Shopping”
map): Bloomie’s is my favorite of the big stores, as much for its
democratic spirit as its designer boutiques. This store has just
about anything you may want. The smaller, downtown branch at
504 Broadway (at Broome Street; % 212-729-5900; Subway: N, R to
Prince Street) is great for those who feel overwhelmed by the typi-
cal large-department-store experience.
 Henri Bendel, 712 Fifth Ave. (between 55th and 56th streets; 
% 212-247-1100; www.henribendel.com; Subway: N, R to Fifth
Avenue): The store is gorgeous and so are the goods inside —
super stylish and expensive stuff for women with a flair for the
funky and frilly.
 Lord & Taylor, 424 Fifth Ave. (at 39th Street; % 212-391-3344;
www.lordandtaylor.com; Subway: B, D, F, V to 42nd Street, or 7 to
Fifth Avenue; see the “Midtown Shopping” map): L&T is, in its own
way, retro-chic, kind of the antidote to those boutiques in SoHo and
Nolita. The holiday windows are always a treat.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
218

 Macy’s, Herald Square (where West 34th Street, Sixth Avenue, and
Broadway meet; % 212-695-4400; www.macys.com; Subway: B, D, F,
N, Q, R, V, W to 34th Street; see the “Midtown Shopping” map):
Macy’s has something for every taste and every price range, and
it’s truly massive, so pace yourself. The springtime flower show in
its great hall is a special event, as is the thrill of meeting Santa —
just like Natalie Wood did in Miracle on 34th Street. The annual
Thanksgiving Day parade ends here.
 Saks Fifth Avenue, 611 Fifth Ave. (at 50th Street; % 212-753-4000;
www.saksfifthavenue.com; Subway: E, V to Fifth Avenue/53rd
Street; see the “Midtown Shopping” map): Even if there’s a Saks in
your town, be sure to stop into this flagship location. Smaller and
more lavish than some of the other department stores, Saks best
typifies New York verve and spirit.
 Tiffany & Co., 727 Fifth Ave. (at 57th Street; % 212-755-8000;
www.tiffany.com; Subway: N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street):
Tiffany’s, as in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. You can ogle the gems, house-
wares, and other shoppers just like Audrey Hepburn did in the 
classic movie. Prepare for lots of company on the third (silver 
jewelry) floor.
Shopping in Open-Air Markets
New York hosts some great outdoor farmers’ markets, flea markets, and
street fairs — weather permitting, of course.
New York has greenmarkets at various locations throughout the city 
on different days, but the biggest and the best is the Union Square
Greenmarket. You can find pickings from upstate and New Jersey farms,
fresh fish from Long Island, homemade cheese and other dairy products,
baked goods, plants, and organic herbs and spices. It’s a true New York
scene with everyone from models to top chefs poring over the bounty.
The Union Square Greenmarket is open all year but is at its peak August
through October when the local harvest — tomatoes, corn, greens,
grapes, peaches, peppers, and apples — flourishes. The greenmarket is
set up on the west and north sides of the square, between 14th and 17th
streets, every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday year-round
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Go early for the best selection. (See the “Downtown
Shopping” map.)
Antiques are big in New York, and the locals love to browse and (some-
times) stumble upon real treasures in several markets:
 The Annex Antique Fair & Flea Market, on Sixth Avenue at 25th
Street, is probably the most famous market of its type. It has furni-
ture, but also a lot of bric-a-brac, and it’s open Saturday and Sunday
from sunrise to sunset. (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 219

 The SoHo Antiques Fair and Collectibles Market, on Grand Street at
Broadway, also has furniture and accessories. It’s open Saturday and
Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
 The I.S. 44 Flea Market, on Columbus Avenue between West 76th
and West 77th streets, specializes in secondhand clothes, antiques,
and jewelry; it’s open year-round on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m., and also on Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. during
spring, summer, and fall. (See the “Uptown Shopping” map.)
On weekends from spring to fall, you can catch a major New York enter-
prise called the street fair. The street fair is a generic fair; the food, clothes,
and crafts sold by vendors are the same at every fair, and if you’ve seen
one, you’ve seen them all. Still, you might find some good items at very low
prices, enjoy the people-watching, and indulge in some corn dogs and zep-
poli. Look for listings in the magazines Time Out New York and New York.
New York’s sidewalks are home to a plethora of (often illegal) street ven-
dors. And they don’t succumb to bad weather. Indeed, at the first sign of
rain, men selling umbrellas appear on almost every corner! (Don’t spend
more than $5 for an umbrella unless you’re desperate.) These “umbrella
men” and other vendors operate year-round, working the streets and
subway stations of the most popular neighborhoods. Other vendors sell
everything from socks to “pre-owned” Rolex watches. Sometimes you can
find bargains — every winter I buy inexpensive gloves, hats, and scarves to
replace the ones I lose in a bar or a cab — but it’s best to approach many
of these enterprises with skepticism. The thousands of street vendors who
offer gold jewelry and watches at cheap prices are selling fake goods, of
course — with the exception of the occasional vendor of stolen merchan-
dise. Other hotbeds for imitation (or knockoff) designer goods and poor-
quality, bootleg DVDs are the stalls along Canal Street in Chinatown.
Part IV: Exploring New York City

Scoring at the sample sales
A bargain-hunter’s dream, sample sales are events at which New York fashion design-
ers sell — at deep discounts — discontinued styles, overstocks, and the sample out-
fits they create to show to store buyers (hence the name “sample sales”). How great
are the deals? It’s entirely possible to get a $300 dress from a big-name designer for
$45 or less. Because the sales aren’t widely publicized and may last anywhere 
from two days to a week, you have to hunt around to get the inside scoop. The weekly
magazines Time Out New York and New York publish lists of upcoming sales; you also
can try the Web sites www.nysale.com, www.dailycandy.com, and www.
inshop.com for information.
Bring cash; credit cards are rarely accepted. You have more to choose from if you fit
what designers call an “average” size — a U.S. 8 or 10 for women, a 40 for men. Items
are sold as is, so try things on before you buy — and be prepared to do it in the middle
of the shopping floor at the more frenzied sales.

Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Concentrated areas for great shopping exist throughout New York.
Some, however, are better than others. And new zones seem to sprout
up every year, so you’re hard-pressed not to find good shopping no
matter where you happen to be. What follows are the best neighbor-
hoods, at this writing, for shopping.
Uptown
If you can find any bargains uptown (especially on the East Side), let me
know, and I’ll investigate that very rare phenomenon. You rarely score
any deals here; the stores in this area are some of the most expensive in
town. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun window-shopping and
dreaming about what you can do with lottery winnings.
Madison Avenue
High fashion and high prices are what you find in the stores on Madison
Avenue between 57th and 78th streets. (If you can’t find some of these
stores on the “Uptown Shopping” map, check out the “Midtown
Shopping” map.) Here you can find Barneys (see the “Knowing the Big
Names,” section earlier in this chapter) and some other high-end empo-
riums. To catch everything, start at one end and walk the length of this
swanky strip. Take the 6 train to 77th Street and walk south; or take the
4, 5, or 6 to the 59th Street stop or the N or R to Lexington Avenue and
walk north. I’ve mentioned only a few of the most notable stores along
this strip; you’re sure to find others along the way.
Along Madison Avenue, you find top European fashion designers’ shops,
such as the ultra-elegant Giorgio Armani, 760 Madison Ave. (at 65th
Street; % 212-988-9191), and his younger and less expensive line,
Emporio Armani, 601 Madison Ave. (at 60th Street; % 212-317-0800);
the playfully chic Chloé, 850 Madison Ave. (at 70th Street; % 212-717-
8220); the ever-trendy Dolce & Gabbana, 825 Madison Ave. (at 69th
Street; % 212-249-4100); the simply gorgeous Missoni, 1009 Madison
Ave. (at 77th Street; % 212-517-9339); and the classic Yves Saint Laurent,
855 Madison Ave. (at 70th Street; % 212-517-7400).
American designers are represented, too. Browse Calvin Klein, 654
Madison Ave. (at 60th Street; % 212-292-9000); Carolina Herrera, 
954 Madison Ave. (at 75th Street; % 212-249-6552); Betsey Johnson,
1060 Madison Ave. (at 80th Street; % 212-734-1257); and Ralph Lauren,
888 Madison Ave. (at 72nd Street; % 212-434-8050); among others.
If you’re in search of fine Italian shoes and leather, visit Prada, 841 Madison
Ave. (between 69th and 70th streets; % 212-327-4200). Don’t forget to
stop by Bulgari, 783 Madison Ave. (at 67th Street; % 212-717-2300), the
big name in Italian jewelry, to see what the ladies in Monte Carlo are
wearing around their necks this year. Hermès has also an unmissable
New York flagship at 691 Madison Ave. (at 62nd Street; % 212-751-3181).

Midtown
From classic department stores to flagship “brand” stores like Niketown,
you’ll find a lot of variety (except in price, which is usually high) on
luxury items, jewelry, clothing, and accessories in this area.
Fifth Avenue and 57th Street
Big-name shopping is the order of the day in this area, centered on Fifth
Avenue south of 59th Street and East 57th Street up to Lexington Avenue.
(See the “Midtown Shopping” map.) This is the area where you can find
major stores like Bloomingdales, Tiffany & Co., Bergdorf Goodman,
and Saks Fifth Avenue (see “Knowing the Big Names,” earlier in this
chapter). To get here, take the subway to one of the nearby stops: the 
E or V to Fifth Avenue/53rd Street; the N, R, or W to Fifth Avenue/59th
Street; or the 4, 5, or 6 to 59th Street. From any of these points, you can
explore north and south on Fifth Avenue and east and west on 57th Street.
Stores on this stretch include those of some top European haute couture
designers, such as Dior, 21 E. 57th St. (between Fifth and Madison avenues;
% 212-931-2950); Chanel, 15 E. 57th St. (between Fifth and Madison
avenues; % 212-355-5050); and Versace, 647 Fifth Ave. (at 54th Street;
% 212-317-0224). The high-end names for accessories and shoes are
here also, including Ferragamo, 725 Fifth Ave. (at 56th Street; % 212-
759-3822); Gucci, 685 Fifth Ave. (between 53rd and 54th streets; % 212-
826-2600); Louis Vuitton, 1 E. 57th St. (at Fifth Avenue; % 212-758-8877); 
and Fendi, 720 Fifth Ave. (at 56th Street; % 212-767-0100).
Among the other big names in this area is Niketown, 6 E. 57th St. (at Fifth
Avenue; % 212-891-6453), the five-floor shoe and clothing emporium
that appears to be one giant “Just Do It” commercial. As you enter, check
out the five-story screen that unfurls periodically to show a video mon-
tage of Nike’s ultra-famous pitchmen and -women. A few blocks down on
Fifth Avenue is the NBA Store, 666 Fifth Ave. (at 52nd Street; % 212-515-
6221), where, in addition to all sorts of NBA and WNBA merchandise, you
may catch a player at an in-store signing.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
222
They say it’s not a mall . . .
But what else would you call it? The Shops at Columbus Circle, located in the Time
Warner Center, not only features some of the biggest (and most expensive) names in
retail, but also offers shopping with a view of Central Park. The mall, located just off
the southwest corner of Central Park, is two city blocks long and four stories high. But
the picturesque view doesn’t really matter to serious shoppers who are setting their
sights on the goods at retailers like Williams-Sonoma, A/X Armani Exchange, Coach,
Bose, Face Stockholm, Eileen Fisher, Thomas Pink, and the massive 59,000-square-
foot Whole Foods Market. For more information about the Shops, you can check out
the mall’s Web site at www.shopsatcolumbus.com or call % 212-823-6300.

Herald Square and the Garment District
You can actually find some bargains around here, along with an actual
mall. (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
This area is dominated by the self-proclaimed “Biggest Department Store
in the World”: Macy’s. But you can also find Lord & Taylor here (see
“Knowing the Big Names,” earlier in this chapter). But it’s because of
Macy’s and Lord & Taylor that the area has attracted other big names
like Old Navy, 150 W. 34th St. (% 212-594-0049), where you can outfit
your extended family at bargain-basement prices; throwaway fashion
temple H&M, 1328 Broadway (at 34th Street; % 212-564-9922); and the
mega-sneaker emporium, Foot Locker, 120 W. 34th St. (% 212-629-4419). 
At Sixth Avenue and 33rd Street is the Manhattan Mall (% 212-465-0500), 
where you can find mall standards like Radio Shack and LensCrafters.
The Meatpacking District and Chelsea
Neither of these neighborhoods is known primarily for shopping; the
Meatpacking District has traded the sounds of butchery for the sounds
of music emanating from high-end clubs, and Chelsea is the place for 
art-gallery hopping. Still, some major designers have set up shops in
these areas, including Diane Von Furstenberg, 874 Washington St. (at
14th Street; % 646-486-4800), and Stella McCartney, 429 W. 14th St. 
(% 212-255-1556). Another reason to come here (and with an appetite)
is the Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Ave. (at 15th Street; www.chelseamarket.
com), a gourmet food bazaar. Take the A, C, E, or L to 14th Street to
explore the area. (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
Downtown
Head downtown for the edgy, the alternative, the hip, the tacky, and the
cheap (though sometimes it costs a lot of money to look cheap). (See
the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
SoHo
New Yorkers moan that formerly artsy SoHo has become an outdoor
shopping mall — and, well, we’re right. Despite the complaints, SoHo is
one of the best shopping neighborhoods in the city. Even the street ven-
dors are a cut above here; my own sidewalk purchases include supersoft
baby one-pieces, colorful bags, and even inexpensive silver jewelry, all
sold by the crafters who made them.
SoHo is loosely bordered by Grand Street to the south, Avenue of the
Americas (Sixth Avenue) to the west, Broadway to the east, and Houston
to the north, forming a quadrangle. Here’s my suggested plan of attack:
Enter the quadrangle at one of the four corners and walk up and down
or left and right (pretend that you’re hoeing a field). Take the A, C, or E
to Canal Street; the C or E to Spring Street; the N or R to Canal or Prince
Street; or the F or V to Broadway/Lafayette Street.
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 223

Designer shops include Anna Sui, 113 Greene St. (% 212-941-8406), and
a strikingly designed Prada flagship at 575 Broadway (% 212-334-8888).
Other notable boutiques include Camper, 125 Prince St. (% 212-358-
1842), for highly original and highly comfortable shoes; A.P.C., 131
Mercer St. (% 212-966-9685), a trust-fundie hipster’s paradise; and
Fragments, 116 Prince St. (% 212-334-9588), a favorite for eye-catching
jewelry. If you’re in the market for something naughty, you can’t go
wrong at Agent Provocateur, 133 Mercer St. (% 212-965-0339), or Kiki
de Montparnasse, 79 Greene St. (% 212-965-8150). For more G-rated
items, the toy collectibles store Kid Robot, 118 Prince St. (% 212-966-
5427), is unmissable.
International chains include MUJI, 455 Broadway (% 212-334-2002), a
Japanese housewares and clothing store with a devoted following; and
Topshop, 478 Broadway), a British retailer with a devoted following
whose first U.S. store is set to open in October 2008.
Rizzoli, 454 W. Broadway (% 212-674-1616), a bookstore synonymous
with elegance, is also in the area; shop here for unusual editions and
extravagant art books. Kate’s Paperie, 561 Broadway (% 212-941-9811),
features a tempting array of paper products, in spite of the generally
indifferent customer service.
NoHo and Nolita
Nolita and NoHo have been hot shopping areas for more than a few
years now and don’t seem to be fading. Here you can find tiny boutiques
specializing in high-quality fashion and design. Don’t expect cheap, and
if you’re an early bird, do your shopping somewhere else first; most
shops don’t put out the welcome mat before 11 a.m. Nolita and NoHo are
on the east side of Broadway and Lafayette from SoHo. Take the N or R
to Prince Street, the 6 to Bleecker Street or Spring Street, or the F or V to
Broadway/Lafayette Street.
In Nolita, the buildings and shops are smaller and the atmosphere is 
less hyped than in SoHo. The best streets to start your explorations are
Mulberry and Spring, and work your way northeast. The best places to
smarten up your look include baby blue line, 238 Mott St. (% 212-226-
5866), for women’s clothing; Seize sur Vingt, 243 Elizabeth St. (% 212-
343-0476), for menswear; Highway, 238 Mott St. (% 212-966-4388), for
purses and bags; Sigerson Morrison, 28 Prince St. (% 212-219-3893), for
fine footwear; Selima Optique, 25 Prince St. (% 212-334-8484), for eye-
glasses; and Push, 240 Mulberry St. (% 212-965-9699), for jewelry. Come
with money to burn.
NoHo is home to cutting-edge designers such as Daryl K, 21 Bond St. 
(at Lafayette; % 212-529-8790). Also found in this area are the achingly
hip clothing shop Oak, 28 Bond St. (near Lafayette; % 212-677-1293),
and vintage-wear veteran Screaming Mimi’s, 382 Lafayette St. (between
Great Jones and East 4th streets; % 212-677-6464). And if you need any

more proof of New York’s transformation from punk paradise to con-
sumers’ delight, designer John Varvatos (formerly of Polo Ralph Lauren
and Calvin Klein) has taken over the former CBGB’s space at 315 Bowery
(at Bleecker Street; % 212-358-0315.
Chinatown and the Lower East Side
The heart of Chinatown’s commercial zone runs along Canal Street, from
West Broadway to the Bowery. (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
Here, interspersed with more fruit, vegetable, and fish markets than you
can imagine, you pass store after store — most hallway-sized stalls —
selling “designer” sunglasses, watches, and handbags (Gucci, Coach,
Louis Vuitton, and Kate Spade, for example), as well as bootleg CDs and
DVDs. The film quality of these bootlegs is so bad that you feel like
you’re watching a movie through a screen door. No matter what you find
here, don’t expect quality; still, it can be fun to browse, and after you get
a sense of the prices, haggle a bit.
Existing alongside this extravaganza of fake merch is the other Chinatown,
where you can find quirky, one-of-a-kind Asian-inspired gifts at bargain-
basement prices. Mott Street, south of Canal Street, has a stretch of
knickknack and housewares shops that sell everything from lacquered
jewelry boxes and toys to embroidered silk pajamas and pottery dinner-
ware. If you prefer one-stop shopping, try Pearl River, 477 Broadway
(between Grand and Broome streets; % 212-431-4770); technically in
SoHo, this is a department store complete with a waterfall and specializ-
ing in all things Chinatown — food, music, movies, clothing, and more.
The Lower East Side’s main shopping is on Orchard Street, now known
as the Historic Orchard Street Shopping District, which basically runs
from Houston to Canal along Allen, Orchard, and Ludlow streets, spread-
ing outward along both sides of Delancey Street. The bargains aren’t
quite what they used to be, but prices on leather bags, shoes, luggage,
and fabrics on the bolt are still quite good. Be prepared for the hard sell
and don’t worry about saying no.
Two stores I recommend are Jutta Neumann, 158 Allen St. (% 212-
982-7048), for handcrafted leather goods; and Bluestockings, 172 Allen
St. (% 212-777-6028), one of the city’s last remaining radical book-
stores. You can preview a list of other vendors in the area online at
www.lowereastsideny.com.
Lower Manhattan and the Financial District
You won’t find any major shopping areas in lower Manhattan and the
Financial District, but you will find a few excellent stores like Century
21, 22 Cortlandt St. (% 212-227-9092). This king of discount department
stores is across the street from the World Trade Center site, along with
the city’s best electronics retailer, J&R Music & Computer World, Park
Row (% 800-426-6067 or 212-238-9000), which is a block-long emporium
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 225

where you can find great prices on everything from cameras and com-
puters to CDs and software.
The most concentrated shopping in this area is at the South Street
Seaport (% 212/732-8257; www.southstreetseaport.com). Familiar
names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Bath & Body Works, Brookstone, and
the Sunglass Hut line Fulton Street, which is the Seaport’s main cobbled
drag; similar shops fill the levels at Pier 17, a waterfront barge turned
shopping mall. Come anyway — for both the historical ambience and
the wonderful harbor views.
Other shopping areas
A host of other shopping zones exist all around Manhattan. If you’re
looking for something specific, chances are there’s a part of town that
sells nothing but what you want. The most famous is probably the
Diamond District, a conglomeration of jewelry and gem stores along
West 47th Street (between Fifth and Sixth avenues; www.47thstreet.
com). If you’re after beads, crafts, and notions, the area between 35th
and 39th streets between Fifth and Sixth avenues is the place to go. In
the Village, Bleecker Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues is home
to a number of used CD stores; check out St. Mark’s Place between
Second and Third avenues as well.
Teenagers and those striving for a younger look love the shoes, clothing,
and leather shops that populate 8th Street from Second to Sixth avenues
(east of Broadway, 8th Street becomes known as St. Mark’s Place).
Clothes and accessories for trendsters are also to be found on 7th and
9th streets.
The Best of New York Shopping A to Z
If your shopping intentions are less of the browsing variety, here are
some of New York’s specialized shopping options.
Beauty
 C.O. Bigelow, 414 Sixth Ave., between 8th and 9th streets (% 212-
533-2700; www.bigelowchemists.com; Subway: A, C, E, F, V to
West 4th Street; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): Who’d think
that a 168-year-old apothecary would carry the city’s most eclectic,
enjoyable, and international collection of healthy skin and per-
sonal-care products? The goods run the gamut from Kusco-Murphy
hair creams to French Elgydium toothpaste; they tend to be over-
priced but sometimes too good to pass up.
 Kiehl’s, 109 Third Ave. (between 13th and 14th streets; % 212-677-
3171; www.kiehls.com; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to 14th Street/Union
Square; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): More a cult than a
store, where the staff usually have flawless skin. Everyone from
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
226

models to stockbrokers stop by this always-packed old-time
apothecary.
 Lush, 531 Broadway (near Spring Street; % 212-925-2323; www.
lush.com; Subway: N, R to Prince Street; see the “Downtown
Shopping” map): The super-fresh, all-natural, handmade bath and
beauty products are irresistible here, and I’m not the only one who
thinks so, to judge by the number of outposts that keep opening
around the city. The SoHo location often offers free in-store treat-
ments; an Ocean Salt scrub followed by a dose of Dream Cream left
my winter-roughened hands baby soft for days afterward. Also at 
7 E. 14th St. (at Fifth Avenue; % 212-255-5133; see the “Downtown
Shopping” map); 1293 Broadway at 34th St. (% 212-564-9120; see
the “Midtown Shopping” map); and 2163 Broadway (between 76th
and 77th streets; % 212-787-5874; see the “Uptown Shopping” map).
 Ricky’s, 44 E. 8th St. (at Greene Street; % 212-254-5247; www.
rickys-nyc.com; Subway: N, R to 8th Street; see the “Downtown
Shopping” map): This chain of funky drugstores also features a
wide range of beauty products. If you’re just dying for a multicol-
ored wig, rainbow-colored lipstick, glitter galore, more than 80
kinds of hair brushes, and even edible undies, this is the store for
you. At numerous other locations as well.
 Zitomer, 969 Madison Ave. (at 76th Street; % 212-737-2016; www.
zitomer.com; Subway: 6 to 77th Street; see the “Uptown Shopping”
map): This three-story drugstore is more a mini-department store
than a pharmacy. It has its own very good line of cosmetics called 
Z New York. Big Apple lip gloss makes a wonderful souvenir —
something you won’t find in your local Walgreens.
Books
 Books of Wonder, 16 W. 18th St. (between Fifth and Sixth avenues;
% 212-989-3270; www.booksofwonder.net; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 
6 to 14th Street/Union Square; see the “Midtown Shopping” map):
This store is beloved by kids (the addition of cupcakes for sale in
the adjoining cafe helps), though the selection isn’t as extensive as
you might hope. It’s a particularly good stop if you’re looking for a
signed book (my nephew still thanks me for his Tiki Barber–
autographed copy of By My Brother’s Side) or a collectible chil-
dren’s book (such as vintage Nancy Drew).
 Drama Book Shop, 250 W. 40th St. (between Eighth and Ninth
avenues; % 212-944-0595; www.dramabookshop.com; Subway: A, C, 
E to 42nd Street; see the “Midtown Shopping” map): You can often
hear staged readings or authors reading from their own work here.
Offering thousands of plays, from translations of Greek classics to
this season’s biggest hits, the shop also offers books, magazines,
and newspapers on the craft and business of the performing arts.
 Forbidden Planet, 840 Broadway (at 13th Street; % 212-473-1576;
www.fpnyc.com; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to 14th Street/Union Square; 
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 227

see the “Downtown Shopping” map): Here’s the city’s largest collec-
tion of sci-fi, comics, and graphic-illustration books. The proudly
geeky staff really knows what’s what.
 McNally Jackson, 52 Prince St. (between Lafayette Avenue and
Mulberry Street; % 212-274-1160; www.mcnallyjackson.com;
Subway: N, R to Prince Street; see the “Downtown Shopping” map):
I appreciate this compact, well-organized bookstore for its carefully
considered selection of books, including Canadian and British
titles. The store is staffed by true book lovers and is known for its
special events.
 Partners & Crime, 44 Greenwich Ave. (at Charles Street; % 212-
243-0440; www.crimepays.com; Subway: 1 to Christopher Street;
see the “Downtown Shopping” map): This is not only the largest
mystery and crime-focused bookshop in the city, but also the best.
The staff readily offers recommendations, and rare and first edi-
tions are also available.
 The Strand, 828 Broadway (at 12th Street; % 212-473-1452; www.
strandbooks.com; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to 14th Street/Union
Square; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): A New York legend,
the Strand is worth a visit for its staggering “18 miles of books” as
well as its extensive inventory of review copies and bargain titles at
up to 85 percent off list price. Also check out the Strand Annex, 95
Fulton St. (between William and Gold streets; % 212-732-6070;
Subway: 4, 5, 6 to Fulton Street).
Edibles
 Dean & DeLuca, 560 Broadway (at Prince Street; % 212-226-6800;
www.dean-deluca.com; Subway: N, R to Prince Street; see the
“Downtown Shopping” map): This upscale gourmet store in the heart
of SoHo is a symbol of that area’s prosperity. The store features pre-
mier quality across-the-board at premium prices. A small cafe in the
front of the store makes this place a great stop for a cappuccino break.
 Dylan’s Candy Bar, 1011 Third Ave. (at 60th Street; % 646-735-0078;
www.dylanscandybar.com; Subway: 4, 5, 6, N, R to 59th Street; see
the “Midtown Shopping” map): Dylan (daughter of Ralph) Lauren is
one of the co-owners of this new wonderland that would make Willy
Wonka proud. Located across the street from Bloomingdale’s, Dylan’s
stocks candy classics like Necco wafers, Charleston Chews, and both
of my favorite childhood chewing gums: Black Jack and Gold Mine.
 Economy Candy, 108 Rivington St. (between Delancey and Norfolk
streets; % 212-254-1531; www.economycandy.com; Subway: F to
Delancey Street; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): Although
Dylan’s is the new generation of candy store, Economy Candy, open
since 1937 in the now-gentrified Lower East Side, is a blast from the
past. Here, if you’re somewhat aged (as I am), you’ll recognize
treats from your childhood like Hot Tamales, Bit-O-Honey candy,
Kosher rock candy, Atomic Fireballs, and Necco Wafers.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
228

 Fairway, 2127 Broadway (between 74th and 75th streets; % 212-
595-1888; www.fairwaymarket.com; Subway: 1, 2, 3, to 72nd
Street; see the “Uptown Shopping” map): You won’t find a better all-
in-one market in Manhattan. Here you can find the best and most
modestly priced vegetables and cheeses in the city. Fairway also
carries gourmet items you may find at Dean & Deluca, but at a frac-
tion of the cost. The Harlem store is huge and features a walk-in
freezer complete with down jackets provided for customers. Also at
2328 12th Ave. (at 132nd Street; % 212-234-3883; Subway: 1, 9 to
125th Street). Also in Red Hook, Brooklyn, at 480–500 Van Brundt St.
(% 718-694-6868).
 Kee’s Chocolates, 80 Thompson St. (between Spring and Broome
streets; % 212-334-3284; www.keeschocolates.com; Subway: 
C, E to Spring Street; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): I am a
serious chocoholic, and I’m limiting myself to this one recommen-
dation. Kee Ling Tong makes her chocolates right next door to her
spare shop, where only a small glass case stands between you and
heaven. The crème brûlée bonbon is a fan favorite, but the mango
green tea truffle and the champagne ganache are also satisfying.
The Key lime macarons (not to be confused with macaroon can-
dies) are also divine.
 Zabar’s, 2245 Broadway (at 80th Street; % 212-787-2000; www.
zabars.com; Subway: 1 to 79th Street; see the “Uptown Shopping”
map): More than any other New York gourmet food store, Zabar’s is
an institution. This giant deli sells prepared foods, packaged goods
from around the world, coffee beans, fresh breads, and much more
(no fresh veggies, though). You can also find an excellent — and
well-priced — collection of housewares and restaurant-quality
cookware. Brace yourself for crowds.
Electronics
 Apple Store, 767 Fifth Ave. (at 59th Street; % 212-336-1440;
www.apple.com/retail; Subway: N, R to Fifth Avenue; see the
“Midtown Shopping” map): Mac-heads now have three temples in
Manhattan for new gear and Genius Bar visits. The largest is the
most touristed: The entrance is a transparent glass cube at the
corner of 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, with the store itself below
street level. It’s open 24/7 and usually packed, though the design of
the space doesn’t make browsing insufferable and the employees
are helpful. If you think coming after midnight will enable you to
play with the floor samples in peace, think again; as one employee
told me with a sigh, it’s always nuts. Also at 103 Prince St. (at
Greene Street; % 212-226-3126; Subway: N, R to Prince Street) and
401 W. 14th St. (at Ninth Avenue; % 212-444-3400; Subway: C, E to
14th Street).
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 229

 B&H Photo & Video, 420 Ninth Ave. (at 34th Street; % 800-606-
6969; www.bhphotovideo.com; Subway: A, C, E to 34th Street; see
the “Midtown Shopping” map): Looking for a digital camera at a
good price? You really can’t do any better than B&H, the largest

“Downtown Shopping” map): You may worry that you’re walking into
the back entrance of a Chinese restaurant when you come here, but
you’re in the right place. Kiosk is a gallery boutique that showcases
elegant, functional everyday items from foreign countries: Think
Japanese notebooks with satiny recycled paper, single-use packets of
Pustefix bubbles, or a German vegetable peeler with a special nib for
cutting out potato eyes. Recent finds are from Hong Kong, and none

2050; www.colonymusic.com; Subway: N, R to 49th Street, or 1 to
50th Street; see the “Midtown Shopping” map): Housed in the leg-
endary Brill Building, the Tin Pan Alley of ’50s and ’60s pop, this
place has been around since 1948. You can find a great collection of
Broadway scores and cast recordings; decades worth of recordings
by pop song stylists both legendary and obscure; the city’s best
collection of sheet music; and a great selection of original theater
and movie posters.
 House of Oldies, 35 Carmine St. (at Bleecker St.; % 212-243-0500;
www.houseofoldies.com; Subway: A, C, B, D, F, V to West 4th

% 212-614-0185; www.jammyland.com; Subway: F to Second
Avenue; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): If you’re a claustro-
phobic reggae lover, plan to do lots of deep breathing along with
your crate digging in this tiny joint. The selection of rock steady,
ska, and reggae is worth it; I finally found a Carlton & His Shoes CD
I’d been seeking for years here. As we went to press, Jammyland
closed its 3rd Street store, another victim of skyrocketing rents.

 Scholastic Store, 557 Broadway (between Spring and Prince streets;
% 212-343-6187; www.scholasticstore.com; Subway: N, R to
Prince Street; see the “Downtown Shopping” map): Despite the name,
the Scholastic Store sells high-quality books and toys (such as

excellent collection of educational toys.

Subway: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 to 42nd Street; see the “Midtown Shopping”
map): Yeah, okay, you have a Toys “R” Us in the mall back home.
But does your local have its own full-scale Ferris wheel where your
kids can ride for free? Don’t miss it if you’re traveling with kids (but
brace yourself for a lengthy line).

Following an Itinerary: 
Five Great Options
In This Chapter
 Exploring the best of New York in three to five days
 Making the most of many museums
 Following the paths of history
I
first visited New York as a teenager and have lived here for much of
my adult life, and I still haven’t seen it all. That’s not because I don’t
have the desire to see it all; it’s just that in New York, you can’t see it all,
if only because the rate of change is always faster than you are. So if you
feel a bit overwhelmed by all the options, I’ve laid out a few itineraries in
this chapter that help you focus on your interests and use your time
most efficiently, while giving you a good sampling of what New York has
to offer. Feel free to tailor these itineraries to suit your own schedule
and taste.
New York in Three Days
Although your three-day visit may take place in the middle of the week,
I’m writing this section as if your three days are part of a long weekend.
Even if you’re constantly on the move, you just can’t cover all of New
York in 72 hours. This itinerary enables you to get a taste of New York —
just enough to make you want to come back for more.
Day one
Okay, start by getting a big picture of Manhattan. The best way to do this
is to take either a three-hour Circle Line Cruise or the two-hour New
York Waterways (see Chapter 11) full-island cruise. Both encircle
Manhattan from the water. You pass by the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island, see the lower Manhattan skyline, go up the East River where you
cruise under the Brooklyn Bridge, view the United Nations, cruise
around to the Hudson River where you pass the George Washington
Bridge, and then head back to dock on the West Side piers.

The ride on both cruises is generally calm, but if you’re prone to seasick-
ness like me (and Dramamine isn’t an option), you may want to consider
the land alternative: a double-decker bus tour. Gray Line New York (see
Chapter 11) offers many tour options, but the one that passes most of
the major attractions is the downtown loop. The tour takes approxi-
mately two hours and shows you Times Square, the Empire State
Building, the Flatiron Building, Rockefeller Center, Greenwich Village, the
Lower East Side, and Chinatown.
Be aware that the tour is only as good as the tour guide and, unfortu-
nately, some of the Gray Line double-decker bus tour guides will fill you
with misinformation. Also, if you’re here for a three-day weekend, do this
tour on either Saturday or Sunday morning. The double-decker buses
get stuck in traffic just like anything else on wheels. Traffic is relatively
light on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and you should cruise through
the tour without any traffic hiccups.
You’re deposited on the West Side Highway around 42nd Street after
your morning boat tour, or in Times Square if you took the Gray Line
downtown loop bus tour. Head over a couple of blocks to Ninth Avenue
and have lunch at one of Hell’s Kitchen’s inexpensive ethnic restaurants.
(See Chapter 10 for some restaurant suggestions.)
After lunch you can walk east across 42nd Street to see more sights. You
pass through the most famous crossroads in the world, 42nd and
Broadway. Make your way through the crowds and continue east where
you hit Bryant Park; if you see camera crews and tents in the park it
means it’s Fashion Week, or you may browse gift vendors during the 
holiday season. On Fifth Avenue at 42nd is one of New York’s great 
structures: the New York Public Library. As you walk farther east
between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue, you see Grand Central
Station, another of New York’s architectural treasures, and at Lexington
Avenue, the city’s most magnificent Art Deco building (and my personal
favorite), the Chrysler Building. Finally, make your way back to Fifth
Avenue and walk 8 blocks south to 34th Street. Look up — all the way to
the top of the Empire State Building. You’ve got your tickets already
(order them online before you leave), so you don’t have to wait on line
to get to the 86th-floor observatory, and check out the view from the
tallest building in New York.
You’ve done a lot of walking, so head back to your hotel and rest for a
bit before setting out again. It’s Friday night and that means museums
are usually open late. You don’t have time to hit them all, so I recom-
mend the Metropolitan Museum of Art (see Chapter 11), where, not
only will you be in one of the world’s greatest museums, but if you go 
on Friday or Saturday, the Met’s beautiful Great Hall Balcony Bar is open
for cocktails with classical music from a string quartet. From May to
October in good weather, the lovely open-air Roof Garden Cafe overlook-
ing Central Park is also open. I find people-watching on the front steps to
be enjoyable, too.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
234

After the museum and cocktails, you’ve got reservations at one of those
four-star restaurants run by a chef you’ve seen on television and on the
cover of a famous magazine. Now you can judge for yourself what all the
fuss is about.
Day two
Have your hotel give you a wake-up call — you have plenty of time to
sleep on the flight home. Grab a quick, light breakfast, and then head
down to Chinatown in the morning and watch as the fish markets (and
there are a lot of them) prepare the day’s catch (some still flopping in
the ice). Canal Street is the area’s major thoroughfare, and by 11 a.m. on
most days, especially on Saturdays, the sidewalk is absolutely teeming;
so the earlier you get to Chinatown, the better.
Next, walk or get on the no. 6 train at the Canal Street station and take it
one stop downtown to the Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall stop. You’re going
to see New York’s City Hall, but it’s the Brooklyn Bridge that you want. 
If the weather is decent, follow the signs to the walkway that takes you
across that amazing structure; this walk is one I take with every one of
my visiting friends and relatives. Don’t forget to turn around for photo
ops with the New York skyline behind you. After you reach Brooklyn and
you’ve worked up an appetite, you deserve a reward; head to the foot of
the bridge and fill up with a real New York pizza at Grimaldi’s, and then
walk to the river’s edge to treat yourself to an ice cream at the Brooklyn
Ice Cream Factory (see Chapter 10).
If you don’t want to walk back across the bridge to work off lunch, take
the C train at High Street back into Manhattan and get off at Spring
Street. At Spring Street, you’ve entered the fashion-conscious neighbor-
hood known as SoHo. Traverse Spring Street and then up West
Broadway to Prince Street. With all the designer boutiques and funky
(but expensive) stores to explore, the going is going to be slow. (I don’t
normally recommend this on a weekend, but you should see it while
you’re here.)
Walking north across Houston, you enter Greenwich Village. Its narrow
streets and numerous cafes are often overrun with tourists, but it retains
its charm. Have a cappuccino at one of the cafes, or eat an early dinner
(look for early-bird and prix-fixe specials!), and then head back to your
hotel to freshen up.
Tonight’s the night you’ve got tickets to that Tony-award-winning show
on Broadway. This is also your chance to take a peek at the neon specta-
cle of Times Square. After the show, if you’re still itching to move, hit
one of the downtown dance clubs (see Chapter 15), or if you’re hungry
and just want a late bite, you have numerous options.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 235

Day three
For some reason, you wake up and miss hearing the sounds of birds
chirping like you hear back home. Not to worry — get on the subway
and make your way to New York’s green oasis, Central Park. But first
pick up some bagels and coffee for a breakfast alfresco. For hints on
where you can get the best bagels, see Chapter 10. The park is vast with
much to explore (see Chapter 11 for ideas); then amble over to the
Museum of Natural History, on Central Park West. The museum opens
at 10 a.m.; if you get there much later on a Sunday, expect to wait in line.
The “must-sees” are numerous, but make sure you check out the
dinosaurs or maybe the space show at the Rose Center for Earth and
Space. (For more on what to see, head to Chapter 11.)
After the museum, you may still have time to catch a gospel service
(assuming this is Sun) in Harlem, which you can follow up with a soul
food lunch (see Chapters 10 and 11. Or head across the park to the East
Side and walk Museum Mile where you can see museums like the
Guggenheim, the Frick, and the Whitney to name just a few (see
Chapter 11). You won’t have time to explore all of them, but find one
that interests you and make it your afternoon destination.
Have a light dinner at one of the city’s very good pizzerias or anywhere
else you like and then cap off your whirlwind New York weekend listen-
ing to some live music at a club or relaxing in a cozy bar. (See Chapter 15
for tips on where to find them.)
New York in Five Days
Compared to three days in New York, you’re going to feel like five days is
a lifetime — until all the things you want to do begin to add up and you
realize that even in five days you can’t do it all. Try not to stress.
Remember: You’re never going to do it all. But the following itinerary
gives you an idea of what you can do, and it will be plenty.
Day one
Start your day and your visit at the beginning, where the city was born:
Manhattan’s southern tip, New York’s oldest and most historic precincts.
Leave early to catch the morning’s first ferry to the Statue of Liberty
and Ellis Island (see Chapter 11). This ride will take up most of your
morning.
After you’re back on the island, if you didn’t arrange for tickets before
you left home, pop over to the downtown TKTS booth at South Street
Seaport (the line is usually shorter than at the Times Square location) to
pick up some discounted tickets for a Broadway or Off-Broadway show
(something’s always available for the evening; see Chapter 14).
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
236

By now, you’re sure to need lunch, if you haven’t succumbed to your
hunger already. Do you want a leisurely meal or a quick snack? Check
the options listed in Chapter 10. Or hop the subway over to Brooklyn
(the A or C line will whisk you from lower Manhattan over to the High
Street stop in minutes) and stroll back to Manhattan over the majestic
Brooklyn Bridge. The bridge and the views from it beg to be pho-
tographed. Or, if you prefer, use the time to enjoy one of lower
Manhattan’s many historic or cultural attractions, such as the insightful
and moving Museum of Jewish Heritage, a Living Memorial to the
Holocaust; surprisingly diminutive Wall Street; or the National Museum
of the American Indian, housed in the stunning, 1907 Beaux Arts U.S.
Customs House, which is worth a visit for the architecture alone. (See
Chapter 11 for more information on the city’s best architecture.) Or just
wander Battery Park with its many memorials and stunning views of
New York Harbor.
Head back to your hotel to freshen up so you can enjoy dinner at one of
the city’s hundreds of fantastic restaurants, see a Broadway show, or
stop at a club for some dancing or to listen to some jazz.
Day two
Spend most of the day at one of the big museums: either the
Metropolitan Museum of Art or the American Museum of Natural
History. Both can fill days of browsing, so you may want to begin with a
Highlights Tour. Don’t miss the dinosaurs, the Butterfly Conservatory 
(if you’re here at the right time of year), or the Space Show at the
Natural History Museum’s Rose Center for Earth and Space.
After you’ve had enough of the museum, head into Central Park (see
Chapter 11) to see some of its many highlights; both museums sit on its
fringe. You’ve worked up a big appetite with all that walking, so plan for
another special dinner followed by the nightlife of your choice; the
options are limitless.
Day three
Start your morning with a full-island cruise with either Circle Line (three
hours) or New York Waterways (two hours), which circumnavigate
Manhattan and offer a fascinating perspective on the island. If you’re
strapped for time, opt for the 11⁄2-hour cruise around New York Harbor
and halfway up the East River.
Spend the afternoon roaming some of the city’s downtown neighbor-
hoods: Bustling Chinatown, shopping meccas SoHo and Nolita, and the
19th-century streets of Greenwich Village. Walk the prime thorough-
fares, poke your head into shops, or park yourself at a street-side cafe
and just watch the world go by. If you prefer to have a knowledgeable
guide as you explore, schedule a guided walking tour (see Chapter 11
for a list of various tours, including free ones).
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 237

Stay downtown for the evening; catch dinner in a stylish (or authenti-
cally old-world) restaurant and follow dinner up with a trip to a dance
club or cocktail lounge. (See Chapter 15 for recommendations.) Or if
you’ve had enough of downtown, head back to your hotel and freshen
up, and then head uptown for dinner; maybe order up some down-home
cooking in Harlem and wander over for some jazz at the Lenox Lounge
or St. Nick’s Pub.
Day four
Head over to Rockefeller Center and see if you can get on one of the
early NBC Tours (for information on times, ticket prices, and reserva-
tions, call % 212-664-7174). While you’re waiting for the tour to begin,
zip up to the Top of the Rock, where views, many people feel, are better
or comparable to those from the Empire State Building. Then make your
way to nearby MoMA. If it’s a weekday morning, you may actually see
the works on exhibit at this amazing and popular museum instead of
having to peer around a mass of bodies for a peek.
After you’re done, walk 8 blocks to Grand Central Terminal (the walk is
pleasant on a nice day) to admire that marvelous Beaux Arts monument
to modern transportation. The dining concourse on the lower level gives
you some very good lunch options.
If you never made it to the Top of the Rock, head down to the Empire
State Building (flip to Chapter 11 for details) to see the view from the
86th-floor observation deck of New York’s tallest building and ultimate
landmark skyscraper. Spend the rest of the afternoon browsing a few of
the Big Apple’s brilliant smaller museums. Take in the Frick Collection,
the Whitney, or the recently renovated Morgan Library. Or, if you
prefer, use the afternoon to stroll up Madison Avenue and gawk, or exer-
cise your credit line, at the staggeringly expensive shops.
Enjoy another evening at the theater, or catch a performance at Lincoln
Center, Carnegie Hall, or one of the city’s other terrific performing-arts
institutions. Don’t forget the innovative Brooklyn Academy of Music;
it’s easy to get to by subway with many of the major lines stopping
nearby (see Chapter 14).
Day five
Use the morning to explore one of the major attractions you’ve missed
thus far. If you spent day two at the Met, spend today at the American
Museum of Natural History. If you made it to the top of the Empire
State Building, but not to the Top of the Rock, now’s your chance to
compare views. Or go see Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic Guggenheim
Museum. Tour the nerve center of international relations: the United
Nations. If you haven’t seen Central Park yet, go now; you can’t leave
New York without visiting it. If you’ve already done all the above, maybe
today is the day you leave Manhattan for the Bronx and make a stop at
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
238

the fabulous Bronx Zoo or the Bronx Botanical Garden. Or head to
Brooklyn for the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Botanic
Gardens (see Chapter 11).
In the evening, celebrate the end of a great vacation with some live
music. A night of jazz at the Village Vanguard, or rock at Arlene’s
Grocery, or maybe some Haitian compass music at S.O.B.’s, makes a
very festive close, as does a night of laughs at one of the city’s legendary
comedy clubs, such as Carolines or the Comedy Cellar. Or, for the ulti-
mate in New York elegance, dress to the nines and opt for a night of
champagne and cabaret at the venerable Cafe Carlyle or Feinstein’s at
the Regency. If you want the velvet rope experience, head to one of the
city’s dance clubs. This is your last night, so make it memorable. (Flip to
Chapter 15 for a rundown of the city’s nightlife offerings.)
New York for Museum Mavens
New York has so many museums and galleries, you can spend your
entire vacation seeing them. But even if you’re a maven, that’s a bit
extreme. Here’s a stress-free two-day museum itinerary.
Start at the busiest and most extensive museum, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. Plan to arrive around opening time (9:30 a.m.) to 
avoid the crowds. Give yourself a minimum of two hours for your 
visit, and pace yourself — choose the galleries of most interest to you.
(Remember: The Met is closed on Mon.) From the Met, stroll up Museum
Mile and try to decide if you want to go inside that funny-looking build-
ing (the Guggenheim), or head south to the Frick or the Whitney or any
of the other fine museums in the area. But you won’t have time to visit
more than one before your hunger wins out. Head to Midtown for lunch;
see Chapter 10 for more restaurant information.
After lunch, head to 53rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, and
visit the jewel-like Museum of Modern Art (MoMA; see Chapter 11). If
you have the time and energy, just up the street is the American Folk
Art Museum (also detailed in Chapter 11). If you’re truly dedicated, you
can try to make it to west Chelsea in time to hit the galleries there, and
then eat at one of the innumerable restaurants nearby.
After a night dreaming of gilded treasures, take the subway to Brooklyn
for part two of your museum-going adventure and the second-largest
museum after the Met, the Brooklyn Museum of Art. You’re in Brooklyn
and you’ve got all morning, so give yourself three hours at this museum,
and if the weather’s nice, take a stroll in the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens.
Take the train back to Manhattan and, if you didn’t get to Chelsea for a
bit of gallery hopping, now’s your chance. Wander from 13th Street to
the south and 29th Street to the north between Seventh and Eleventh
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 239

avenues; some of the big names here include the Gagosian Gallery,
Marlborough, Annina Nosei, and PaceWildenstein. Or check out the
Studio Museum of Harlem. (For more information about museums in
New York, see Chapter 11.)
New York for Families with Kids
New York, despite its gritty reputation, is a wonderland for children.
Start your family vacation at the great Museum of Natural History. Take
the little ones directly to the fourth floor and the dinosaur exhibit. After
they’ve had enough dinosaurs, steer the brood to the Rose Center for
Earth and Space, whose four-story-tall planetarium sphere hosts the
Robert Redford–narrated space show that will awe all of you. Or, if your
timing is right, the Butterfly Conservatory is a wonderful chance to see
these delicate, beautiful creatures up close. The museum is across from
Central Park, the perfect place for a picnic lunch with the family.
Children can explore much in Central Park: playgrounds galore, boat
rides, the Central Park Zoo, the carousel, and ice-skating. To do it all
takes a day in itself.
After lunch, take the C train at Central Park West and 81st Street down-
town to Times Square, where the kids can gawk at all the lights, familiar
stores, arcades, and junk food that the flashy tourist zone has to offer. If
you have little ones, take them to the Toys “R” Us superstore (see
Chapter 12) where they can get a ride on the store’s indoor Ferris wheel.
(If the lines are too long, they may be just as amused by riding the
store’s escalators.) You’re all probably famished by now, so treat the
family to dinner at Virgil’s Real Barbecue or Carmine’s, both extremely
kid-friendly (see Chapter 10).
The next day, head over to the Hudson River piers in the West 40s and
take either the three-hour Circle Line cruise around Manhattan or the
90-minute New York Waterways Harbor Cruise. Both offer a different
perspective on some of the city’s greatest attractions like the Statue of
Liberty, Ellis Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the United Nations.
For lunch, the pizza at John’s Pizzeria, just off Times Square, can make
any kid happy. After lunch, work your way to 34th and Fifth and the
Empire State Building. Because you’ve already bought tickets (see
Chapter 11), you won’t have to wait in line, and you and your family are
quickly whizzed up to the 86th-floor observatory where you experience
the same view King Kong had when he climbed to the top. From the
observation deck, look downtown and tell the kids that is where they’re
going for dinner: to Chinatown where the constant commotion, street
vendors, flopping fish, and all-around exotic feel may excite the children
as much as they do you. After the excitement of the day, you’re all going
to be famished and ready for a big, communal, and inexpensive dinner at
one of Chinatown’s many restaurants.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
240

After dinner, take the 6 train uptown to 14th Street/Union Square where
you’ll switch to the no. 4 express train. Stay on the train until you come
out of the tunnel and see the bright lights of Yankee Stadium. Your stop
is Yankee Stadium, and you’re here to see one of the most celebrated
franchises in all sports.
If you have another day with the family, take a poll from the kids on what
they want to do. Return to Central Park? Head up to the Bronx Zoo? Or
out to Queens and the New York Hall of Science? Visit a few museums
like the New York Transit Museum, the Skyscraper Museum, or the
Children’s Museum? Check out South Street Seaport? Explore the activi-
ties of Chelsea Piers? You’ll have fun, whatever you decide.
It’s always good to have a Plan B in case it rains (or snows). The weather
may very well determine how much walking you can do (or want to do).
New York for History Buffs
The history of most cities is written in its neighborhoods. New York is
no exception. Try this itinerary and visit some of the city’s historic
neighborhoods to get a feel for the character and growth of New York.
Start in lower Manhattan, at the extreme southern tip of the island of
Manhattan. At Battery Park, you can see Castle Clinton, completed in
1808. Just a short walk away is the gorgeous U.S. Customs House, built in
1907, which houses the National Museum of the American Indian at the
George Gustav Heye Center.
Though most of the lower Manhattan historic sights are within walking
distance, the Alliance for New York offers free bus service on its
Downtown Connection bus (see Chapter 8 for details).
Next on your walking/bus tour should be historic Wall Street and the
Federal Hall National Monument (circa 1842), along with the famous
statue of George Washington. Also on Wall Street is Trinity Church, built
in 1846 and beautifully preserved.
For a taste of modern and very tragic history, a few blocks up from
Trinity Church you can see the huge, eventually-to-be-built-upon open
lot that, before September 11, 2001, was the site of the World Trade
Center. Almost directly across the street and miraculously spared from
the terrorist attacks is St. Paul’s Chapel, built in 1766 and part of Trinity
Church, where George Washington was a frequent worshiper.
From here, you want to get on one of those free buses and take it east to
the South Street Seaport and Museum where the 18th- and 19th-century
buildings lining the cobbled streets and alleyways have been impeccably
restored. You can also hit the very modern mall-like shopping center and
numerous restaurants here if you’ve had too much history or you just
want to take a lunch break.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 241

After lunch, you can head to another historic downtown neighborhood,
the Lower East Side, which is a tenement neighborhood where many
immigrants — notably Eastern European Jews — settled back in the mid-
to late 19th century. Delancey Street and historic Orchard Street are
the main thoroughfares to explore. And to get the best taste of what life
was like for the immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, visit
the Lower East Side Tenement Museum (see Chapter 11). Then treat
yourself to some great ice cream at Il Laboratorio del Gelato next door
or head to Houston Street and Katz’s Delicatessen for a genuine New
York egg cream (see Chapter 10).
Take a break and rest a bit before heading out to your next neighbor-
hood, Greenwich Village. The Village has always been the domain of the
unconventional; the place for radical thinkers; the haunt of literary fig-
ures like Henry James, Eugene O’Neill, and Dylan Thomas. Artists like
Edward Hopper and Jackson Pollack and the famous beatniks Allen
Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs lived and hung out in
Greenwich Village. Unlike other parts of the city, the Village is not laden
with historical landmarks. Its landmarks are its streets, alleyways, and
brownstone blocks.
The physical center of the Village is Washington Square Park, located in
the heart of New York University, where along with some serious chess
players, some entertaining street performers, and a few determined drug
dealers, you can see the famous Washington Square Arch. The heart of
beatnik society was centered on Bleecker and MacDougal streets. Stop
and have an espresso at one of the many cafes in the area; the people-
watching doesn’t get any better. The West Village around Christopher
Street is the center of the pioneering gay community where you find
some quaint boutiques and more cafes.
Dinnertime should be approaching, and maybe you’ve planned ahead
and have reservations, or maybe you just want to try one of those pizzas
from Lombardi’s. (For more ideas on restaurants, see Chapter 10.) No
matter when you get out of dinner, the Village will still be buzzing with
activity. You may want to hear some jazz at the venerable Village
Vanguard club or catch a comedy show at the Comedy Cellar. (See
Chapter 15 for more on clubs and bars.)
Continue your historic neighborhood itinerary the next day on the
Upper West Side. The Upper West Side has a history of liberalism and of
being a home to musicians. The great performing arts venue, Lincoln
Center, at 64th Street and Broadway, is the unofficial gateway to the
Upper West Side.
From Lincoln Center cut over to Central Park West and you see the
grandeur of that boulevard lined with Beaux Arts apartment houses, the
oldest being the Dakota, built in 1884 on Central Park West and 72nd
Street. The Dakota has the infamous distinction of being not only the
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
242

location for the Roman Polanski film Rosemary’s Baby, but also where
John Lennon, who lived there with Yoko Ono, was shot and killed. Other
famous residents of the Dakota have included Leonard Bernstein, Lauren
Bacall, and Judy Garland.
Walk west across 72nd Street to Broadway where you can see the 
area’s other magnificent residence, the Ansonia at 73rd and Broadway.
Musicians such as Caruso, Toscanini, and Igor Stravinsky, to name just a
few, have called this building home.
If you’re hungry, grab some lunch at Zabar’s (see Chapter 12), the area’s
most famous gourmet-food store, and take it to Riverside Park for a
picnic lunch overlooking the Hudson River or walk a few blocks east to
Central Park. If you choose to go east, you may want to stop at the New-
York Historical Society at Central Park West and 77th Street (see
Chapter 11 for details). If you choose west, stroll up Riverside Drive,
which features some of the city’s most stately apartment houses.
After lunch, head up to Harlem where the wealthiest New Yorkers lived
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the Harlem mansions
still stand and are impeccably preserved. On 130th Street between Fifth
and Lenox avenues, you can see a series of 28 redbrick town houses,
known as the Astor Row Houses, which date back to the early 1880s. On
139th Street between Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and Frederick Douglass
boulevards sits the impressive Strivers’ Row, where hardly a brick has
changed among the gorgeous neo–Italian Renaissance town houses that
were built in 1890. After the original white owners moved out, these
lovely houses attracted the cream of Harlem, “strivers” like Eubie Blake
and W. C. Handy.
Handsome brownstones, limestone town houses, and row houses are
sprinkled atop Sugar Hill, 145th to 155th streets between St. Nicholas
and Edgecombe avenues, named for the “sweet life” enjoyed by its resi-
dents. Finally, head up to 160th Street, east of St. Nicholas Avenue, to 
see Manhattan’s oldest surviving house, the 1765-built Morris-Jumel
Mansion, 65 Jumel Terrace (% 212-923-8008; www.morrisjumel.org;
Open: Wed–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m. for tours).
All that history works up a major appetite, so stay in Harlem for dinner;
you can’t go wrong with the soul-food buffet at Charles’ Southern Style
Kitchen (see Chapter 10).

o other city rivals New York in the breadth and scope of the per-

Your biggest problem is going to be choosing among the many tempta-
tions.
Getting the Inside Scoop
For the latest, most comprehensive nightlife listings, from theater 
and performing arts to live rock, jazz, and dance club coverage, Time
Out New York (www.timeoutny.com) is my preferred weekly source; 
a new issue hits newsstands every Thursday. The New York Times
(www.nytoday.com) features excellent entertainment reviews and list-
ings, particularly in the Friday “Weekend” section. The cabaret, classical
music, and theater guides are particularly useful. The city’s legendary
weekly alterna-paper, the free Village Voice (www.villagevoice.com),
isn’t as revered as it used to be, but the arts-and-entertainment coverage
is still worthwhile. Other great weekly sources are the New Yorker
(www.newyorker.com), in its “Goings on About Town” section, and New
York magazine (www.nymag.com), whose “Agenda” features the latest
happenings. I also recommend Flavorpill, a carefully curated list of the
most intriguing cultural events around town; check the Web site or sub-
scribe to the weekly e-mails at www.flavorpill.com.
Theatre Development Fund’s Show Search (www.tdf.org) provides
schedules, descriptions, and ticket information for theater and the per-
forming arts.

A little research can get you an array of information and reviews of cur-
rent shows. The New York Times is a good source for the scoop on big
theater shows; the Village Voice is strong on alternative culture. The list-
ings in New York magazine, the New Yorker, and Time Out New York regu-
larly offer information about both mainstream shows and those off the
beaten path. The following Web sites also offer valuable theater informa-
tion, and the opportunity to purchase tickets:

 I Love New York Theater: www.ilovenytheater.com

Taking in New York Theater
New York’s theater scene is second to none. With so much breadth and
depth, and so many wide-open alternatives, just keeping up with it is
exhausting as well as exhilarating, especially for theater buffs. Broadway,
of course, gets the most ink and the most airplay. Broadway is where you
find the big stage productions, from crowd-pleasing warhorses like The
Lion King and Mamma Mia! to the phenomenally successful shows like
Wicked and Avenue Q. But smaller “alternative” theater has become popu-
lar both commercially and critically, too. With bankable stars on stage,
crowds lining up for hot tickets, and hits popular enough to generate
major-label cast albums, Off-Broadway isn’t just for culture vultures.
Helping to assure the recent success of the New York theater scene is
the presence of Hollywood stars like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julia
Roberts, Morgan Freeman, and Laurence Fishburn. But keep in mind that
stars’ runs on stage are often limited, and tickets for their shows tend to
sell out fast.
If you hear that an actor you’d like to see is coming to the New York
stage, don’t put off your travel and ticket-buying plans. (The box office
can tell you how long a star is contracted for a role.)
Figuring out the Broadway basics
The terms Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway refer to thea-
ter size, pay scales, and other details, not location — or, these days, even
star wattage. Most of the Broadway theaters are in Times Square, around
the thoroughfare the scene is named for, but not directly on it. Instead,
you can find theaters dotting the side streets that intersect Broadway,
mostly in the mid-40s between Sixth and Eighth avenues (44th and 45th
streets in particular), but also running north as far as 53rd Street.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
248

Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 249
Off-Broadway, on the other hand, can be anywhere. Off-Off-Broadway
shows tend to be more avant-garde, experimental, and/or nomadic (and
also have the cheapest ticket prices). Off- and Off-Off-Broadway produc-
tions tend to be based downtown, but mini theater districts exist in
Midtown and on the Upper West Side as well. Broadway shows tend to
keep regular schedules. Eight performances a week is the norm, with
evening shows on Tuesday through Saturday, plus matinees on
Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. Evening shows usually start at 8 p.m.,
while matinees are usually at 2 p.m. on Wednesday and Saturday, and 
3 p.m. on Sunday, but schedules can vary. Broadway and Off-Broadway
shows usually start exactly on time; if you arrive late, you may have to
wait until after the first act to take your seat — so be on time and you
won’t miss any of the show.
Culture for free: Shakespeare 
in Central Park
A New York institution since 1957, Shakespeare in the Park is as much a part of a New
York summer as fireworks on the Fourth of July. Shakespeare in the Park is the brain-
child of the late Joseph Papp, founder of the Public Theater, who came up with the
idea of staging two Shakespeare plays each summer at the open-air Delacorte Theater
in Central Park. Best of all, and the reason Shakespeare in the Park has become an
institution, is that the performances are free.
Two shows are offered (though it’s sometimes reduced to one in years when budgets
are tight), usually a Shakespeare play featuring a large company and a more modern
theater classic, including at least one or more “names” from film and television. The
productions run from June to August. Depending on the star power of the cast, tick-
ets can be quite scarce. The program for 2008 was the first Central Park production of
Hamlet since 1975, and a 40th-anniversary revival of Hair, which was the Public
Theater’s first show at its current Lafayette Street headquarters.
The Public Theater also presents music at the Delacorte: two weeks (usually in
September) of concerts called “Joe’s Pub in the Park,” an outdoor version of the artists
featured at Joe’s Pub (www.joespub.com), the intimate music venue at the Public
Theater.
Roughly 1,800 tickets are distributed at the Delacorte on a first-come, first-served basis
(two per person) for the plays, starting at 1 p.m. on the day of each performance. But
keep in mind that people start lining up hours in advance, so bring a book or some
refreshments and be prepared to wait. Tickets are also available between 1 and 3 p.m.
on the day of the performance at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette St. (between Astor
Place and East 4th Street in the East Village); the lines get long there, too. You can also
try getting tickets in an online lottery on the Public’s Website.
For more information about Shakespeare in the Park, contact the Public Theater 
(% 212-539-8500; www.publictheater.org).

Getting theater tickets
Ticket prices for Broadway shows vary dramatically. Expect to pay a lot
for good seats; you’re looking at $100 to $150 or more for full-price tick-
ets to any given show. The cheapest end of the price range can be
around $25 to $50, depending on the theater configuration. If you’re
buying tickets at the low end of the available range, be aware that you
may be buying obstructed-view seats. If all tickets are the same price or
the range is small, you can pretty much count on all the seats being
pretty good.
Two pet peeves of mine: Despite having to pay so much for a show,
many theaters haven’t installed more comfortable seating (especially in
the older theaters, which can date from the early 20th century). Even if
you’re of modest build, you may feel uncomfortably close to your fellow
theatergoers and as though your knees are up to your chest — and
those are orchestra seats. Consider yourself forewarned. Also, the days
are long gone when people actually dressed up for live theater, but
where’s the harm in making a little effort to look pulled together? If your
usual uniform is jeans and sneaks, upgrade to business casual for the
evening — because you’re shelling out for the tickets, you may as well
feel special.
Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway shows tend to be cheaper than
Broadway shows, with tickets often as low as $10 or $15. However, seats
for the most established shows and those with star power can command
much higher prices, from $60 and up.
If you’ve decided on a show to see before you leave, have your credit
card in hand and contact any of the following ticket agencies by phone
or on the Web. (You’ll usually have to pay a service fee in addition to the
cost of the tickets, ranging from a few dollars to a lot more for premium
seats to a hit show.)
Some of these organizations have lists of discounted shows, the latest
theater news and reviews, and member bulletin boards where you can
ask for recommendations. If you’re planning to get to as many shows as
you can, it’s worth it to register with a service like Theatermania.com,
Playbill.com, or Broadway.com to get discounts and subscribe their
e-mail newsletters.
 Applause (www.applause-tickets.com): Also offers discounts.
 Broadway.com (www.broadway.com): Also offers dinner packages
and gift certificates.
 Manhattan Concierge (% 800-697-4697 or 888-675-3669; www.
manhattanconcierge.com): A ticket broker that can sell you good
tickets to almost anything (including concerts and sporting
events); expect to pay a service charge.

 Playbill.com (www.playbill.com): The online presence of the
company that distributes the familiar programs with the yellow
logo in theaters; also offers packages, industry news, and photos
and videos of shows. Has a regular list of discounts if you sign up
as a member.
 Telecharge (% 800-432-7250 or 212-239-6200; www.telecharge.

 Theatermania (% 866-811-4111 or 212-352-3101; www.theater

well as full-price and discounted Broadway tickets.

Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 251
Kids like theater, too!
And they have lots of venues and shows to choose from in New York City.
 The New Victory Theater, 229 W. 42nd St. (between Seventh and Eighth avenues;
% 646-223-3020; www.newvictory.org), is a full-time, family-oriented 
performing-arts center and has hosted companies ranging from Aeros, a
Romanian gymnastics troupe, to the astounding Flaming Idiots, who juggle every-
thing from fire and swords to beanbag chairs.
 Called “the most original children’s theater group in the country” by Newsweek,
The Paper Bag Players (% 212-663-0390; www.paperbagplayers.org), per-
form funny tales for children ages 4 to 9 in a set made from bags and boxes at
venues around town including the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, 68th Street
between Park and Lexington avenues (% 212-772-4448).
 TADA! Youth Theater, 15 W. 28th St. (between Fifth Avenue and Broadway; 
% 212-252-1619; www.tadatheater.com), is a youth ensemble that performs
musicals and plays with a multiethnic perspective for kids, teens, and their 
families.
 The Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre (% 212-988-9093; www.central
park.org) puts on marionette shows for kids at its 19th-century Central Park
theater throughout the year. Reservations are a must.
 Yes it’s the same David Mamet who writes those hard-boiled movies and plays,
but he shows his softer side with acclaimed twice-yearly youth productions as
part of his Atlantic Theater Company, 336 W. 20th St. (between Eighth and Ninth
avenues; % 212-691-5919; www.atlantictheater.org).

You can buy same-day tickets at the following outlets:
 TKTS (% 212-221-0013) sells discounted (up to 50 percent)
Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets as they become available from
theaters. A temporary booth is located just outside the Marriott
Marquis hotel on West 46th Street between Broadway and Eighth
Avenue in the Theater District (Open: Mon–Sat 3–8 p.m., Sunday
from 3 p.m. until a half-hour before curtain time, and Wed and Sat
from 10 a.m.–2 p.m. for matinees). The permanent booth is in the
heart of the Theater District in Duffy Square at 47th and Broadway;
at press time, it was closed while Duffy Square was being reno-
vated. A booth is also open downtown at the South Street Seaport
on the corner of Front and John streets (Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–
6 p.m.; at this location and in Brooklyn, matinee tickets can be pur-
chased the day before the show). The newest TKTS booth is in
Brooklyn, in 1 MetroTech Center at the corner of Jay Street and
Myrtle Street Promenade. It keeps the same hours as the downtown
booth.
For the most up-to-date ticket information, consult www.tdf.org.
Before you visit a physical ticket booth, keep in mind that long
lines are the norm, and you’re not guaranteed to get tickets for a
specific show. Also note that tickets for a popular show may be
available because the cast for that day changed, which is not the
best scenario if you have your heart set on seeing a particular pro-
duction or actor.
 For same-day advance tickets at regular prices for most shows,
visit the official booth run by the Broadway League: the Broadway
Ticket Center inside the Times Square Information Center, 1560
Broadway (at 46th Street; % 888-276-2392; Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–
7 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.).
You also can get tickets after you arrive in the city by calling one of the
telephone services listed earlier in this chapter, by asking the concierge
at your hotel, or by using one of the numerous ticket brokers, whose list-
ings you can find in newspapers and in the phone book. According to
New York City law, these brokers are only supposed to charge a $5 fee or
a 10 percent commission, whichever is less. However, New Jersey has no
such law, and a lot of the brokers are based there. Ask about the fee
upfront, because tickets to a very hot show can go for as much as
double or more the face value.
Another option is to call the box office of the theater where the show is
playing to ask whether they have any tickets available, because they
often do. Some long-running shows run special promotions, so it pays to
inquire when you call. As a last resort, remember that a cheap way to
get a seat is not to have one: Standing room is available at some shows
for $20 to $35.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
252

Make the rounds of Broadway theaters at about 6 p.m., when unclaimed
house seats are made available to the public. These tickets — reserved
for VIPs, friends of the cast, the press, or industry professionals — offer
great seats and are sold at face value. (If you’re with someone, tell the
box-office staff that you don’t have to sit together. Single seats are usu-
ally easier to come by than pairs at the last minute).
Also, note that Monday is often a good day to score big-name show tick-
ets. Although many theaters are dark that day, some of the most sought-
after choices aren’t. Locals are likely to stay at home the first night of
the workweek, so the odds of getting tickets are in your favor. Your
chances of getting tickets are always better on weeknights or for
Wednesday matinees, rather than on weekends (but do check and see if
the Big Star is on, rather than the understudy).
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 253
Catching a little pre-theater dinner
For a number of reasons, you want to eat before you go to the theater. If you try to hold
out until after the show, your hunger may distract you from the drama in front of you.
Also, you don’t want to disturb other theatergoers with the rumblings of your stom-
ach! So plan to eat before you go. Many restaurants in the Theater District have pre-
theater prix-fixe specials, and all of them are expert at serving you quickly. Consider
these suggestions:
 db Bistro Moderne, 55 W. 44th St. (between Fifth and Sixth avenues; % 212-
391-2400), is the home of the famous $32 hamburger. If you don’t want a hamburger
made with braised short ribs, foie gras, and shaved black truffles, the restaurant
also offers a three-course pre-theater dinner for $48.
 Molyvos, 871 Seventh Ave. (between 55th and 56th streets; % 212-582-7500), is a
great option for a Greek meal before a concert at nearby Carnegie Hall. The three-
course pre-theater prix fixe at Molyvos is $37.
 Virgil’s Real BBQ, 152 W. 44th St. (between Sixth and Seventh avenues; % 212-
921-9494), is just a short stroll from most Broadway theaters. Because of the pre-
theater dining rush, reservations are an absolute must.
 La Bonne Soupe, 48 W. 55th St. (between Fifth and Sixth avenues; % 212-586-
7650), is just a short stroll to most everything: Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, the
theaters, and Rockefeller Center. The French bistro fare is solid.
Always inform the staff at sit-down restaurants that you have theater tickets; they’ll
make sure you’re out the door in time to make the opening curtain.

Venues That Set the Standard
New York is blessed with a number of amazing venues to hear and see
the performing arts. Some, like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, are so
famous that they’re household names around the globe, while the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, though not quite as famous worldwide, cer-
tainly should be.
The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts
This celebrated complex extends over 4 blocks on the Upper West Side.
It hosts an extraordinary range of productions, from opera to film to
dance to classical music, in the following performance spaces:
 Metropolitan Opera House (% 212-362-6000; www.metopera.org)
is home to the Metropolitan Opera Company (see the “Opera” sec-
tion later in this chapter) and the American Ballet Theatre (see
“Dance” later in this chapter). It also showcases visiting ballet per-
formers from around the world.
 Avery Fisher Hall (% 212-721-6500) is the seat of the New York
Philharmonic (see “Classical Music” later in this chapter), but it
also hosts many seasonal musical events organized by Lincoln
Center, such as Mostly Mozart, and concerts by students from the
Juilliard School.
 New York State Theater (% 212-870-5570) is home to the New
York City Opera (see “Opera”) and the New York City Ballet (see
“Dance”).
 Alice Tully Hall (% 212-875-5050), recently renovated, hosts the
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center (% 212-875-5775;
www.chambermusicsociety.org).
 Walter Reade Theater (% 212-875-5600) is home to the Film
Society of Lincoln Center (www.filmlinc.com), which sponsors
the New York Film Festival and other events.
 The Juilliard School (% 212-769-7406; www.juilliard.edu)
hosts many concerts — mostly classical — as well as other per-
formances. The quality is excellent and the prices are attractive —
many concerts are free. Check the bulletin board in the hall, or call
for current productions. The school also sponsors many free out-
door concerts in the summer.
 Vivian Beaumont Theater (% 212-362-7600) is the city’s northern-
most Broadway theater and shares a building with Mitzi E.
Newhouse Theater, an Off-Broadway venue. They host a variety 
of shows. Together, they form the Lincoln Center Theater
(www.lct.org).

Lincoln Center
The Center also has two outdoor spaces: a central plaza with a huge
fountain (recently updated and upgraded) and Damrosch Park toward
the back. In summer, the outdoor spaces host some great series, such as
Midsummer Night Swing in July and Lincoln Center Out of Doors in
August, as well as many free concerts. Summer is the season of special
series indoors, too — such as the JVC Jazz Festival, Mostly Mozart, and
the Lincoln Center Festival — because it is the resident companies’ 
time off.
Lincoln Center is turning 50 in 2009, and marking the anniversary with
renovations that will add new performing spaces, a restaurant, visitor
center, and redesign the open spaces within the “campus.” Alice Tully
Hall is closed for an 18-month renovation (it will reopen in 2009).
Construction has also blocked off some of the entrances and public
spaces in the venues, and may displace some of the companies for all or
part of their 2008–2009 seasons.

If you want to use public transportation to get to the Center, take the 1
train to 66th Street/Lincoln Center, or take one of the following buses:
M104 (running east–west on 42nd Street, north on Sixth Avenue, and
south on Broadway), M5 and M7 (running up Sixth Avenue and
Broadway), or M66 (across town running west on 67th Street).
Carnegie Hall
Perhaps the world’s most famous performance space, Carnegie Hall
offers everything from grand classics to the music of Ravi Shankar. The
Isaac Stern Auditorium, the 2,804-seat main hall, welcomes visiting
orchestras from across the country and around the world. Many of the
world’s premier soloists and ensembles give recitals here. The legendary
hall is both visually and acoustically brilliant; don’t miss an opportunity
to experience it if there’s something on the schedule that interests you.
Also part of Carnegie Hall is the intimate 268-seat Weill Recital Hall,
usually used to showcase chamber music and vocal and instrumental
recitals. Carnegie Hall has also reclaimed the ornate underground 599-
seat Zankel Hall, which was occupied by a movie theater for 38 years.
Carnegie Hall is at 881 Seventh Ave. (at 57th Street). For schedule and
ticket information, check the Web site at www.carnegiehall.org or call
% 212-247-7800. Besides practice, practice, practice, another way to
get to Carnegie Hall is by taking the N, Q, R, or W train to 57th Street.

Jazz at Lincoln Center
Despite its name, Jazz at Lincoln Center (JALC) is not at Lincoln Center: JALC is 4
blocks south in the Time Warner Center at Broadway and 60th Street on Columbus
Circle (% 212-258-9800; www.jalc.org). Though the move was slightly downtown,
the facility change was definitely a step up. Its complex on the fourth floor of Time
Warner’s northern tower features two amazing performance spaces, a jazz club
(Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola), a mini jazz Hall of Fame, and a 7,000-square-foot atrium with
views of Central Park.
The largest of the venues is Rose Hall (also known as “The House of Swing”), where
you may see the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis. Acoustics
are perfect and seating is spacious. The glittering jewel of the Center is the Allen Room
with its 4,500-square-foot glass backdrop behind the main stage offering glittering
views of Central Park and the Manhattan night sky. It’s hard to believe that what was
once played in smoky basements is now presented in venues as spectacular and opu-
lent as these.

Brooklyn Academy of Music
The city’s most renowned contemporary arts institution, Brooklyn
Academy of Music (BAM) is often at the forefront of cutting-edge 
theater, opera, dance, and music. Cate Blanchett, Sir Ian McKellan,
Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Patrick Stewart are just a few of the high-profile,
respected performers who have sold out productions here in the past
several years.
Like Lincoln Center, BAM sponsors many special series, including the
prestigious Next Wave Festival in the fall, a showcase for experimental
American and international artists; and DanceAfrica in spring, a choice
of productions with an African heritage, ranging from traditional to
modern. BAMCinématek offers some of the city’s best film programming,
such as a 2007 series curated by Oscar-nominated actor Paul Giamatti,
the Cinema Club Chair. BAM also sponsors several youth series during
the year and free outdoor concerts throughout the city in the summer.
BAM is at 30 Lafayette Ave. (between Ashland Place and Felix Street; 
% 718-636-4100; www.bam.org); the BAM Harvey Theater is nearby at
651 Fulton St. (between Ashland and Rockwell places). If you want to
take public transportation, take the C to Lafayette Avenue; 2, 4, 5, or Q to
Atlantic Avenue; or the M, N, R, or W to Pacific Street. If you reserve tick-
ets 24 hours in advance and pay $5, you can take the BAMbus from the
Whitney Museum at Altria, 120 Park Ave. (at East 42nd Street), departing
one hour before performance time. The return bus makes several stops
in Manhattan.
Other major concert spaces
Live music is always in the air in New York City. Here are some other
venues where you can hear and see a wide variety of the performing
arts:
 Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Sixth Ave. (at 50th Street; % 212-247-4
777; www.radiocity.com), is a gorgeous venue to see a roster of
renowned artists from Aretha Franklin to Dolly Parton. (See the
“Midtown Attractions” map on p. 172)
 Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32nd Street (% 212-
465-6741; www.thegarden.com), proves that only the biggest stage
is appropriate for the biggest names — Céline Dion, Madonna, Jay-
Z, and Bruuuuuuuce (Springsteen, that is). Bring your binoculars —
that speck on the stage really is Tom Petty. Adjacent to the Garden
is WaMu Theater at MSG (www.wamuatmsg.com), a smaller space
that features lower-key musical acts, such as the Verve, Barrington
Levy, and Robert Plant and Allison Kraus. (See the “Midtown
Attractions” map on p. 172.)
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 257

 Town Hall, 123 W. 43rd St. (between Sixth Avenue and Broadway;
% 212-840-2824; www.the-townhall-nyc.org), is a lovely,
medium-sized theater that hosts a wide range of events — every-
thing from world music to modern dance to solo shows to appear-
ances by musicians and performers of every genre, ranging from
Joan Baez to Colm Wilkinson to Henry Rollins.
 Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, 253 W. 125th St. (between
Adam Clayton Powell and Frederick Douglass boulevards; % 212-
531-5305; www.apollotheater.org), was the ultimate stage 
for musical legends like Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the
Temptations, and James Brown. These days, a steady stream of hip-
hop, pop, and R&B acts perform at this beautifully restored theater;
recent headliners have included John Legend and Morrissey. (Yes,
Morrissey.) Wednesday night is the famous (and gleefully unforgiv-
ing) Amateur Night. (See the “Harlem and Upper Manhattan” map
on p. 181.)
 An Upper West Side institution, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway
(at 95th Street; % 212-864-1414; www.symphonyspace.org),
recently celebrated its 30th year of offering an eclectic mix of per-
forming arts. The variety of shows at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater
includes series by the World Music Institute as well as classical,
rock, blues, and dance. Adjacent to the Peter Jay Sharp Theater is
the Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater; the film revival house known
for its quirky sightlines was rescued by none other than Mr. Spock
and has been totally renovated.
Classical Music
The New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center, at
Broadway and 64th Street (% 212-875-5656; www.nyphilharmonic.
org), offers what many consider to be the city’s best concerts. Ticket
prices generally range from $40 to $115.
Carnegie Hall, at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue (% 212-247-7800;
www.carnegiehall.org), is a gem in the crown of New York’s music
community. The price of a ticket depends on the performance; call or
check the Web site for information. (See the “Midtown Attractions” map
on p. 172.)
The Brooklyn Academy of Music hosts performances of outstanding
quality, some of them experimental or cutting edge. Don’t let the loca-
tion of this venue dissuade you from going to a show — it’s quite easy to
reach. See the “Brooklyn Academy of Music” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, for specifics.

258

Bargemusic, in Brooklyn at Fulton Ferry Landing just south of the
Brooklyn Bridge (% 718-624-2083 or 718-624-4061; www.bargemusic.
org), is an internationally renowned recital room located, yes, on an
actual barge. This venue boasts more than 200 first-rate chamber-music
performances a year. Shows take place on Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday evenings at 8 p.m. and Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. The musi-
cians perform on a small stage in a cherry-paneled, fireplace-lit room
that holds 130 people. The music rivals what you can find in almost any
other New York concert hall — and the panoramic view of Manhattan
through the glass wall behind the stage can’t be beat. Tickets are just
$35 ($20 for students), or $40 ($25 for students) for performances by
larger ensembles. Reserve well in advance. To get to Bargemusic, take
the 2 or 3 train to Clark Street or the A or C to High Street.
Opera
The Metropolitan Opera Company, housed at the Metropolitan Opera
House at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 64th Street (% 212-362-6000;
www.metopera.org), stages classic operas and is the world’s premier
opera company. The sets are works of art, and the performers among
the most famous in the world. Ticket prices range from $15 to $375.
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 259
Dining after the show
It’s a well-known fact that classical music and opera can make you quite hungry. The
good news is that you’re in New York and many restaurants are still open and serving
full dinners past 10 or 11 p.m.
If you’re in the Theater District and you don’t mind being weighted down before bed-
time, finish off an enormous Reuben sandwich and a slice of cheesecake at the
Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave. (at 55th Street; % 800-334-5606 or 212-757-2245).
For most after-hours dining, you may want to head downtown. Two of the most popu-
lar spots are in the Meatpacking District in the West Village, and they’re open into the
wee hours. The authentic bistro Pastis, 9 Ninth Ave. (at Little West 12th Street; 
% 212-929-4844), is an excellent choice. In SoHo there’s raucous Balthazar, 80 Spring
St. (at Crosby Street; % 212-965-1414), and — my favorite — Blue Ribbon, 97 Sullivan
St. (between Spring and Prince streets; % 212-274-0404), which is open ’til 4 a.m.
In the East Village, head to Veselka, 144 Second Ave. (at 9th Street; % 212-228-9862),
a comfortable and appealing diner offering Ukrainian fare at rock-bottom prices 24/7,
and Katz’s Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St. (at Ludlow Street; % 212-254-2246), for
first-class Jewish deli eats served Friday and Saturday until 3 a.m. In Chinatown, many
restaurants are open late or even all night. Of note is Great N.Y. Noodletown, 28
Bowery (at Bayard Street; % 212-349-0923), which is open until 4 a.m. nightly.

The New York City Opera, in the New York State Theater at Lincoln
Center, Broadway and 64th Street (% 212-870-5570; www.nycopera.
com), stages less elaborate shows than the Metropolitan Opera Company
(but from the same classic repertoire), with lower ticket prices — seats
range in price from $16 to $130.
Performances of the Amato Opera Company, 319 Bowery (at 2nd Street;
% 212-228-8200; www.amato.org), are likely to sell out quickly; the thea-
ter has only 100 seats, with an average ticket price of $35. Buy your 
tickets at least three weeks in advance to catch one of its performances
of classic Italian and other opera.
Music Alfresco
With summer also comes the sound of music to Central Park, where the
New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera regularly enter-
tain beneath the stars; for the current schedule, call % 212-362-6000,
212-360-3444, or 212-875-5709, or visit www.lincolncenter.org.
The most active music stage in Central Park is SummerStage, at Rumsey
Playfield, mid-park around 72nd Street. SummerStage has featured every-
one from James Brown to Patti Smith; recent offerings have included
concerts by Zap Mama, the Beastie Boys, and Marianne Faithfull; “Viva,
Verdi!” festival performances by the New York Grand Opera; cabaret
nights; and more. The season usually lasts from June to August.
Although most big-name shows charge admission, there are always a
number of free shows each summer (donations are always accepted).
Call the hot line at % 212-360-2777 or visit www.summerstage.org.
Additionally, most of the city’s top museums offer monthly parties after
regular hours on select nights. The American Museum of Natural
History has generated a lot of buzz lately with its One Step Beyond
party co-sponsored by Flavorpill (www.flavorpill.com) at the Rose
Center for Earth and Space. The Brooklyn Museum of Art hosts the
remarkably eclectic First Saturday program — and it’s free. You can
have lots of fun at other museums as well, including the Guggenheim’s
Art after Dark First Fridays and the Metropolitan Museum of Art
(which hosts classical performances in choice spots such as the Temple
of Dendur). Check the museums’ calendars for the latest events and
ticket information.
Dance
The New York City Ballet (% 212-870-5570; www.nycballet.com) per-
forms at the New York State Theater, sharing this space with the New
York City Opera. The leading dance company in the world, it presents
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
260

wonderfully staged productions featuring world-class dancers. New
works of choreography use both classical and modern music. Their per-
formance of The Nutcracker is a highlight of the Christmas season.
The American Ballet Theater (% 212-477-3030; www.abt.org) per-
forms at the Metropolitan Opera House and shares its space with the
Metropolitan Opera. The guest companies and dancers are of interna-
tional renown in the world of dance.
City Center, 131 W. 55th St. (between Sixth and Seventh avenues; % 877-
247-0430; www.citycenter.org), hosts premier companies, such as 
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Kirov Ballet, and Martha
Graham Company. Some of the world’s leading choreographers have per-
formed there. To get there, take the B, D, or E train to Seventh Avenue.
The Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Ave. (at 19th Street; % 212-242-0800;
www.joyce.org), boasts performances by the likes of the Stephen
Petronio Company, Taylor 2, and MOMIX. To get there, take the C or 
E train to 23rd Street or the 1 to 18th Street.
Radio City Music Hall (see “Other major concert spaces” earlier in this
chapter) is home to a long-standing tradition in New York that’s popular
with children of all ages and needs no introduction: the Rockettes. The
renowned Radio City Christmas Spectacular (% 212-307-1000; http://
christmas.radiocity.com), which runs from late November through
mid-January each year is a one-of-a-kind treat. You can even take a one-
hour Stage Door Tour guided by one of the famed leggy beauties!

I
n this chapter, I dig into the entertaining playtime options in New
York City. Whether it’s live jazz, rock, comedy, or cabaret, or sweating
on a dance floor, sipping a martini while lounging on a plush couch, or
just people-watching in a neighborhood pub, New York has plenty of
choices for your evening’s entertainment.
To find out what’s happening and where, check out these print and
online sources. The Village Voice (www.villagevoice.com) is a free
weekly that has a very good calendar with listings of the latest entertain-
ment. Rivaling the Voice in quality is the weekly magazine Time Out New
York (www.timeoutny.com). Another worthwhile resource is Flavorpill,
available online at www.flavorpill.com (or you can sign up to receive
the weekly e-mail).
A good source for information about bars and clubs is the annual
Shecky’s Bar, Club & Lounge Guide. The Web site at www.sheckys.com
is more current than the book. Another online bar source is www.mur-
phguide.com. This Web site has the latest happy-hour information and
is a useful source if you’re seeking out an Irish pub, of which there are
many in New York.
All About the Music
From garage bands at holes in the wall with no cover charge to the
world’s greatest musicians onstage at Jazz at Lincoln Center, you can
find something for every taste every night of the week in New York.
All that jazz
People come from all over the world to experience jazz in New York at
any of the city’s many celebrated clubs. No matter when you come,
you’re guaranteed to find top talent playing at a city venue. The best of
New York’s jazz clubs include

 Birdland, 315 West 44th St. (between Eighth and Ninth avenues; 
% 212-581-3080; www.birdlandjazz.com): This legendary club is
one of the city’s premier jazz spots. The big room is spacious,
comfy, and classy, with an excellent sound system and top-notch
talent roster any night of the week. Expect lots of accomplished big
bands and jazz trios, but you can’t go wrong with the Sunday night
show, starring Chico O’Farrill’s smokin’ Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra.
(See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Blue Note, 131 W. 3rd St. (at Sixth Avenue; % 212-475-8592;
www.bluenote.net): This Greenwich Village institution attracts
some of jazz’s biggest names. Lately the club seems to book more
popular smooth-jazz acts (Spyro Gyra, anyone?), and prices can be
astronomical. The Late Night Groove Series is more interesting;
recent acts include Burnt Sugar and JC Hopkins Biggish Band. (See
the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Time Warner Center, 60th Street and
Broadway (% 212-258-9595; www.jalc.org): This beautiful, cozy
jazz club is part of the Jazz at Lincoln Center complex in the Time
Warner Center on Columbus Circle. The club attracts an interesting
mix of both up-and-coming and established bands. (See the
“Uptown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Lenox Lounge, 288 Malcolm X Blvd. (Lenox Avenue; between 124th
and 125th streets; % 212-427-0253; www.lenoxlounge.com): The
club’s history includes performances by such artists as Billie
Holliday and Dinah Washington. Now, at this beautifully restored
club, you just may hear the next Billie or Dinah. (See the “Harlem
and Upper Manhattan” map on p. 181.)
 Smalls, 183 W. 10th St. (near Seventh Avenue; % 212-252-5091;
www.smallsjazzclub.com): Jazz lovers were crestfallen when this
tiny subterranean club shut down in 2002 — so much so that musi-
cians rallied and partnered with owner Mitch Borden to reopen it.
Renovated but still intimate, Smalls is for dedicated jazz heads. Pay
the $20 cover and stay as long as you like; you may not emerge ’til
daybreak. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Smoke, 2751 Broadway (between 105th and 106th streets; % 212-
864-6662; www.smokejazz.com): This intimate Upper West Side club
feels like a welcome throwback to more informal clubs of the past,
though it’s not as inexpensive as it used to be. On weekends, music
covers never exceed $30; during the week, there’s usually just a $20
food and drink minimum. (See the “Uptown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 St. Nick’s Pub, 773 St. Nicholas Ave. (at 149th Street; % 212-283-
9728): As unpretentious a club as you’ll find, St. Nick’s in Harlem’s
Sugar Hill district is the real deal, with live entertainment every
night and never a cover. This is where Miles and Coltrane used to
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 263

Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
264
hang out after their own gigs. The tradition continues with Monday
night jam sessions, African music on Saturday nights, and open mic
on Sundays.
 The Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Ave. S. (% 212-255-4037; www.
villagevanguard.net): The Vanguard, established in 1935, is a
New York legend. All the greats, from Miles to Monk, have played
here, and their spirits live on in the new, high-quality talent of fre-
quent performers such as Roy Hargrove and Joshua Redman. (See
the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
It’s only rock ’n’ roll
Rock ’n’ roll abounds in New York; here are just a few of the countless
offerings:
 Arlene’s Grocery, 95 Stanton St. (between Ludlow and Orchard
streets; % 212-995-1652; www.arlenesgrocery.net): This funky
little Lower East Side club has become a big name in the intimate
rock club scene. With covers that rarely peak beyond $10, it’s a bar-
gain as well. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey St. (at Bowery; % 212-533-2111;
www.boweryballroom.com): There’s plenty of room in this club,
but it still has the feel of a more intimate venue. With great sight-
lines and sound, the Bowery Ballroom attracts excellent alt-rock
talent. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 The Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place (at 15th
Street; % 212-777-6800; www.irvingplaza.com): Corporate con-
cert promoter Live Nation changed the name and made some
upgrades, but this midsize music hall is still a prime stop for
national-name rock bands. Recent shows include the Black Crowes,
X, and the Wu-Tang Clan. The best seats can be found in the
upstairs balcony, but come early for a spot. (See the “Midtown Arts
and Nightlife” map.)
 Mercury Lounge, 217 E. Houston St. (at Essex Street and Avenue A;
% 212-260-4700; www.mercuryloungenyc.com): Another excellent
intimate spot for good-quality, hard-edge rock ’n’ roll, and it doesn’t
cost a fortune. As a result, the Merc is always packed. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Terminal 5, 610 W. 56th St. (between 11th and 12th avenues; % 212-
260-4700; www.terminal5nyc.com): The newest jewel in the
Bowery Presents crown, this sister to the Bowery Ballroom and the
Mercury Lounge is more than three times larger than the two of
them put together. With three floors and a capacity of 3,000,
Terminal 5 hosts the bigger draws on the alt-rock scene; the inaugu-
ral season included shows by M.I.A., Rilo Kiley, and Yaz. (See the
“Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)

The best of the rest
What follows are clubs that are tough to classify; on one night they may
feature jazz or blues, and on another night you may hear cutting-edge
rock or world music:
 B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 W. 42nd St. (between Seventh
and Eighth avenues; % 212-997-4144; www.bbkingblues.com):
Despite its name, B.B. King’s rarely sticks to the blues. Here you
can find big-name talent from pop, funk, soul, and rock, more from
the past than from the present. Take your pick: the Saturday
Beatles Brunch, or the Sunday gospel brunch? (See the “Midtown
Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 The Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St. (between Broadway and
Church Street; % 212-219-3132; www.knittingfactory.com): 
At New York’s premier avant-garde music venue, in the four spaces
within the Knitting Factory, you may hear performances ranging
from experimental jazz to acoustic folk to spoken-word to poetry
readings. If you think you have the skills, step up to Hip Hop
Karaoke (www.hiphopkaraokenyc.com); you don’t have to pay
anything for the privilege of making a public idiot of yourself,
either. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 S.O.B.’s 204 Varick St. (at Houston Street; % 212-243-4940; www.
sobs.com): If you think music is for dancing, visit S.O.B.’s, the city’s
top global-music venue, specializing in Brazilian, Caribbean, and
Latin sounds. The packed house dances and sings along to calypso,
samba, mambo, Afrobeat, reggae, or other grooves. It’s very popular,
so book in advance, especially if you want table seating. DJ Rekha’s
bangin’ Basement Bhangra packs ’em in on the first Thursday of 
the month. Friday features a late-night Haitian dance party, while
Saturday is for samba. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
Life is a cabaret
Want the quintessential New York night-on-the-town experience? Take in
a cabaret. But be prepared to part with your greenbacks; covers can
range from $10 to $60 along with a two-drink or dinner-check minimum.
Always reserve ahead. New York’s top cabarets include
 Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 781 Madison Ave. (at 76th Street;
% 212-744-1600): The newly renovated club features classy acts
such as Betty Buckley and Eartha Kitt. Woody Allen also shows up
to jam with the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band on Monday
nights. The room is intimate and as swanky as they come. Expect a
high tab: Music charges are a minimum of $75; with dinner, two
people can easily spend upwards of $300. But if you’re looking for
the best of the best, look no further. (See the “Uptown Arts and
Nightlife” map.)
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 265

 Feinstein’s at the Regency, at the Regency Hotel, 540 Park Ave. 
(at 61st Street; % 212-339-4095; www.feinsteinsattheregency.
com): If you don’t catch song impresario Michael Feinstein playing
here at the club he opened, don’t despair — high-wattage talent is
always on tap. Recent performers include Ben Vereen, Tovah
Feldshuh, and Rita Moreno. (See the “Uptown Arts and Nightlife”
map.)
 Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette St. (between Astor
Place and 4th Street; % 212-539-8778; www.joespub.com): This
isn’t exactly your daddy’s cabaret. Still, this beautiful and popular
club, named for the legendary Joseph Papp, is everything a New
York cabaret should be. The multilevel space serves up an Italian
menu and top-notch entertainment from a more eclectic mix of
talent than you’ll find on any other cabaret calendar. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map).
 Oak Room Cabaret, at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 W. 44th St. (between
Fifth and Sixth avenues; % 212-840-6800): The Oak Room is one of
the city’s most elegant and sophisticated spots for cabaret and
that’s saying a lot. You can almost always be sure that top-rated
talent is headlining here. (See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife”
map.)
New York Comedy Is No Joke
Something about New York makes it a ripe breeding ground for comedi-
ans. The names of those who got their start here, from Dangerfield to
Seinfeld, are like a “who’s who” of comedy. And you never know, the neb-
bishy guy or girl at the mic may be the next Richard Pryor or Ellen
DeGeneres. New York’s top comedy clubs include
 Carolines on Broadway, 1626 Broadway (between 49th and 50th
streets; % 212-757-4100; www.carolines.com): New York’s
biggest and highest-profile comedy club attracts the hottest head-
liners, including D. L. Hughley and Gilbert Gottfried. (See the
“Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Comedy Cellar, 117 Macdougal St. (between Minetta Lane and West
3rd streets; % 212-254-3480; www.comedycellar.com): This inti-
mate, subterranean comedy club is a throwback to the days of the
raw, hard-edge stand-up comedy that spawned Lenny Bruce and
Richard Pryor. Big-name unscheduled drop-ins are frequent; Dave
Chappelle recently held court for nearly four hours. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
266

 Dangerfield’s, 1118 First Ave. (between 61st and 62nd streets; 
% 212-593-1650; www.dangerfieldscomedyclub.com): If Tony
Soprano were a comedy fan, this would be his kind of place. Slick,
mature, and Vegas-like, Dangerfield’s gets plenty of respect. (See
the “Uptown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Gotham Comedy Club, 208 W. 23rd St. (between Seventh and
Eighth avenues; % 212-367-9000; www.gothamcomedyclub.com):
This is New York’s comedy club of the moment. The luxurious Art
Deco–style club provides the backdrop for a couple of TV shows,
including Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and NBC’s Last Comic
Standing. (See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
Hanging Out in New York’s Best Bars
You won’t have to search far to find a place to have a cocktail in New
York. You’ll find bars on every block, sometimes two or three. And they
come in just about every variety from sleek and hip to dark and gritty.
Check out this small sampling of some of my favorite New York bars.
For creative cocktails
 Angel’s Share, 8 Stuyvesant St., 2nd floor (% 212-777-5415): Once
upon a time, I would never have revealed this tucked-away bar in a
guidebook. But the secret’s long been out, and you may as well slip
into this gem to see what the fuss is about (walk though the
unmarked door to your left as you reach the top of the stairs).
Cocktails are made with care here, and service is classy. Bring a
date. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Bemelmans Bar, in the Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th St. (at Madison
Avenue; % 212-744-1600): The bar is a beauty with its whimsical
murals painted by children’s book illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans,
who created the Madeline books. And they make beautiful (and
pricey) cocktails to match the creative setting; some date from the
1860s. (See the “Uptown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 The Den, 2150 Fifth Ave. (between 131st and 132nd streets; % 212-
234-3045; www.thedenharlem.com): For not only the most creative
cocktails north of 96th Street, but also the most imaginative drink
names in Manhattan, come uptown to the fun, funky Den. Here you
can sip concoctions such as “sex in the inner city” and “Bahama
baby mama drama,” while watching a blaxploitation flick off the
bar/restaurant’s brick wall. The drinks are colorful, sweet, and very
potent. (See the “Harlem and Upper Manhattan” map.)
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 267

 Pegu Club, 77 W. Houston St. (between Wooster Street and West
Broadway; % 212-473-7348; www.peguclub.com): Mixologist and
owner Audrey Saunders, formerly of Bemelmans Bar in the Carlyle
Hotel, makes magic with cocktails. Pegu Club is her own little
downtown gathering spot where she can even better showcase her
immense talents. The cocktails, perfectly poured, stirred, and
shaken, change seasonally and will astound you with their creativ-
ity. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
Smoking has been illegal in all restaurants and bars in New York City
(except for a few cigar bars) since 2003. So if you get the urge, join the
huddled (and shivering, in the winter) masses outside the bar, in what
some not-so-fondly call the “Bloomberg Lounge” (after Mayor Mike, who
pushed through the anti-smoking laws).
For old-world charm
 Dublin House, 225 W. 79th St. (between Broadway and Amsterdam
Avenue; % 212-874-9528): For years, like a welcoming beacon, the
Dublin House’s neon harp has blinked invitingly. This old pub is a
no-frills Irish saloon and the perfect spot for a drink after visiting
the Museum of Natural History or Central Park. The Guinness is
cheap and drawn perfectly by the very able and sometimes crusty
bartenders. (See the “Uptown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Ear Inn, 326 Spring St. (between Greenwich and Washington
streets; % 212-226-9060; www.earinn.com): This cluttered old,
1870-established pub is a cranky relief in super-chic SoHo. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 The Old Town Bar & Grill, 45 E. 18th St. (between Broadway and
Park Avenue; % 212-529-6732; www.oldtownbar.com): The bar
where food (get the burger) is shuttled to customers via a dumb-
waiter from the basement kitchen has been featured on film and TV
(the opening credits of Letterman in his NBC days). (See the
“Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Pete’s Tavern, 129 E. 18th St. (at Irving Place; % 212-473-7676;
www.petestavern.com): This place is so old it’s said to have
opened when Lincoln was still president. (See the “Midtown Arts
and Nightlife” map.)
 White Horse Tavern, 567 Hudson St. (at 11th Street; % 212-243-
9260): This circa-1880 pub is where Dylan Thomas supposedly 
had his very last drink before becoming a bar legend. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
For cultural exchange
 The Creek Bar, 240 Mulberry St. (between Spring and Prince
streets; % 212-431-4635; www.eightmilecreek.com): Located
below Australian restaurant Eight Mile Creek, this bar serves up
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
268

Aussie beer, wine, music, and rugby and cricket matches. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Pravda, 281 Lafayette St. (between Houston and Prince streets; 
% 212-226-4944; www.pravdany.com): You can find more than 70
vodkas here, served with caviar and chicken Kiev. Don’t overlook
the specialty cocktails; the pear martini is a winner. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Sakagura, 211 E. 43rd St. (between Second and Third avenues; 
% 212-953-7253; www.sakagura.com): Sake bars are popping up
all over town, but few are as fun to find as this one. Make your way
through a standard office-building lobby and down a staircase; your
reward will be a peaceful place with a treasure-trove of 200 sakes.
(See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Zum Schneider, 107 Avenue C (at 7th Street; % 212-598-1098;
www.zumschneider.com): This authentic indoor German beer
garden is best enjoyed on a spring day, when you can sit on the
benches and catch a breeze. Somehow steins of beer go down very
easily here. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
For dive-bar aficionados
 Jimmy’s Corner, 140 W. 44th St. (between Broadway and Sixth
Avenue; % 212-221-9510): Jimmy’s is a tough guy’s joint that has
happily survived the Disney-fication of Times Square. Beer is cheap
and drinks aren’t fancy, so skip the theme bars and restaurants in
the area and go for an after-theater pop at Jimmy’s instead. (See the
“Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Subway Inn, 143 E. 60th St. (at Lexington Avenue; % 212-223-
8929): This dive has been around for more than 70 years, and it has
the layers of funk to prove it. No matter what time of day, it’s
always dark as midnight inside the Subway Inn. (See the “Midtown
Arts and Nightlife” map.)
For drinks with a view
 Rise Bar, at the Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park, 2 West St. 
(% 212-344-0800): Located on the hotel’s 14th floor, the bar boasts
incomparable views of Lady Liberty and busy New York Harbor.
(See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Pen-Top Bar & Terrace, at the Peninsula Hotel, 700 Fifth Ave. (at
55th Street; % 212-956-2888): The views of Midtown Manhattan are
awesome here and make the steep price of the drinks easier to
take. (See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 269

 79th Street Boat Basin Cafe, 79th Street at the Hudson River 
(% 212-496-5542): As you sip your cocktail, enjoy a beautiful
sunset and watch boats bob on the river; you may just forget
you’re in New York for a moment. Open from May to September.
(See the “Uptown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
For gay and lesbian nightlife
 Barracuda, 275 W. 22nd St. (between Seventh and Eighth avenues;
% 212-645-8613): In the heart of Chelsea, this bar is regularly
voted best gay bar in New York by the various local GLBT publica-
tions. (See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Boiler Room, 86 E. 4th St. (between First and Second avenues; 
% 212-254-7536): This is New York’s favorite gay dive bar and a
fun East Village hangout. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife”
map.)
 Duplex, 61 Christopher St. (at Seventh Avenue; % 212-255-5438;
www.theduplex.com): High camp is the norm at this gay cabaret
and piano bar, still going after 50 years. It once hosted the likes of
Woody Allen and Joan Rivers in their early stand-up careers. (See
the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Henrietta Hudson, 438 Hudson St. (at Morton Street; % 212-924-
3347; www.henriettahudsons.com): This popular lipstick lesbian
hangout has a great jukebox and a DJ on weekends. Expect a $10 to
$20 cover charge. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
Some of the hottest “clubs” are actually traveling parties that alight in
various spots depending on the day, making them hard for visitors to
find. Various publications — Time Out New York, the Village Voice, as
well as the GLBT-specific HX magazine (www.hx.com), lesbian magazine
GONYC magazine (www.gomag.com), and others I list in Chapter 6 — 
provide the best up-to-the-minute club information. Another source is
the LGBT Community Center site at www.gaycenter.org.
Hitting the Dance Clubs and Getting across
the Velvet Rope
Dance-club fame is transient; one year a club can be white hot, and the
next year it’s not even good enough for the bridge-and-tunnel crowd.
These dance clubs, as of this writing, are closer to the hot variety. Keep
in mind that many clubs have dress codes; leave your sneakers, shorts,
flip-flops, and T-shirts at the hotel. Well-dressed folks will always slide
past the velvet ropes first.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
270

 APT, 419 W. 13th St. (near Washington Street; % 212-414-4245;
www.aptwebsite.com): This is my kind of club. Since 2000, APT
has been holding it down with the best beats in a swanky unmarked
space (ring the buzzer). If the names Prince Paul, Grandmaster
Flash, Spinna, or Jazzy Jeff mean anything to you, this is your kind
of club, too. (See the “Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Cain, 544 W. 27th St. (between 10th and 11th avenues; % 212-947-
8000): The theme is Africa — South Africa to be specific. The front
door has elephant-trunk handles, and zebra hides are everywhere.
The big game is celebrity-spotting. (See the “Midtown Arts and
Nightlife” map.)
 Cielo, 18 Little W. 12th St. (between Ninth Avenue and Washington
Street; % 212-645-5700; www.cieloclub.com): At Cielo, you’ll find
the best sound system of any small club in New York. House is big
here, and they bring in some of the best DJs from around the globe.
The renowned Louis Vega spins on Wednesdays; Carl Craig, Frankie
Knuckles, and Junior Vasquez also man the decks. An authentic
disco ball rotates above a sunken dance floor. (See the “Downtown
Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Don Hill’s, 511 Greenwich St. (at Spring Street; % 212-807-7780;
www.donhills.com): This is a long-standing dive that pulls a
crowd as sexually and ethnically diverse as the music and campy
parties it features. Mondo Indie Dance Party? Rated X: The Panty
Party? Metal Meltdown? Truly something for everyone. (See the
“Downtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
 Pacha, 618 W. 46th St. (near 11th Avenue; % 212-209-7500; www.
pachanyc.com): It doesn’t get any hotter than Pacha, a four-floor
megaclub that hosts a revolving door of world-class DJs such as
Carl Cox and Victor Calderone. (See the “Midtown Arts and
Nightlife” map.)
 Swing 46 Jazz & Supper Club, 349 W. 46th St. (between Eighth and
Ninth avenues; % 212-262-9554; www.swing46.com): As its name
suggests, the music here, mostly live, is swing. And if swing dancing
is new to you, lessons are offered Wednesday through Saturday.
(See the “Midtown Arts and Nightlife” map.)
New York nightlife starts late and finishes really late. Things don’t get
going until at least 11 p.m. Most places don’t take credit cards, so bring
cash (or be prepared to fork over a high transaction charge at an in-
house ATM). Cover charges can range from $7 to $30 and often increase
as the night goes on. The best source for club information is the weekly
Time Out New York magazine. It lists cover charges for the week’s big
events and gives sound advice on the type of music and the type of
crowd each event attracts. (Refer to this chapter’s introduction for addi-
tional sources of entertainment information.)

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
give you a heads-up about some New York experiences
you should avoid and some that you should deﬁnitely seek
out. I also offer the lowdown on some of my favorite eating
experiences in the city.

New York City Experiences

 Biking the Hudson
A
s I mention in Chapter 4, New York is a spendy town, but there are
some strategies you can use to have a wallet-friendly trip. Just as
there are many opportunities to empty your bank account, you can also
find many unique things to do that are rich in fun but not in price. Check
out some of my favorite inexpensive (and free!) New York experiences.
Befriend a New Yorker
Don’t be bashful. New Yorkers are friendlier and more helpful than their
reputations suggest. One of the best ways to find out is to take a free
walking tour with a Big Apple Greeter (% 212-669-8159; www.bigapple
greeter.org). This visitor welcome program matches one of its 350 vol-
unteers (who conduct tours in over 20 languages) with visitors who
submit requests at least a month in advance of their arrival. Tours typi-
cally last for two to four hours, and your new New York buddy can show
you around specific neighborhoods at your request, make personal rec-
ommendations, and take you off the beaten path to highlight the every-
day things that makes the city so great. 
Ride the International Express
The no. 7 train is sometimes referred to as the “International Express.”
Take it out of Manhattan and through the borough of Queens, and you
pass through one ethnic neighborhood after another, from Indian to
Thai, from Peruvian to Colombian, from Chinese to Korean. Get off at
any stop along the way and sample the local cuisine; it’s the cheapest
round-the-world trip you can take. Built by immigrants in the early

1900s, the no. 7 Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) brought those same
immigrants to homes on the outer fringes of New York City. That tradi-
tion has continued as immigrants from around the world have settled
close by the no. 7’s elevated tracks.
In 1999, the Queens Council on the Arts nominated the no. 7 for designa-
tion of a National Millennium Trail, and it was chosen as representative
of the American immigrant experience by the White House Millennium
Council, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Rails-to-Trails
Conservancy. For more about the International Express and for tours,
visit the Queens Council on the Arts Web site (www.queenscouncil
arts.org) or call % 718-647-3377.
Party at the Brooklyn Museum
Museum parties have become pretty popular in New York; a few of the
largest museums host monthly blowouts that rival some of the city’s
better nightclubs. (Kanye West recently rocked the mic at the American
Museum of Natural History’s One Step Beyond party, cosponsored by
Flavorpill, the city hipster’s cultural calendar of choice.) But one of the
first parties in town — and still the best — is First Saturdays at the
Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway (% 718-638-5000; www.
brooklynmuseum.org; Subway: 2, 3 to Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn
Museum). From 5 to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month, the
museum presents a slew of free programs, including concerts and dance
parties. A recent First Saturday marked the opening of an exhibition by
Japanese pop artist Takashi Murakami with a “cosplay” photo contest
(competitors dressed as anime and manga characters); traditional
Japanese drumming, Brooklyn-based Japanese rock bands, and Japan’s
top hip-hop DJ; and screenings of the anime film Kiki’s Delivery Service.
Family-friendly First Saturdays offer something for everyone, which is
why it’s perhaps the most beloved museum party in the city.
Explore the (Free) Art in Queens
Most city museums offer hours when admission is free to all, but if
you’re visiting for just a few days, your trip plans may not coincide with
those times. Want your fix of modern and contemporary art but don’t
want to shell out $20 for MoMA, the Guggenheim, or the Whitney? For no
more than the cost of subway fare, you can get it at the Fisher Landau
Center for Art, 38-27 30th St. (% 718-937-0727; www.flcart.org;
Subway: N, W to 39/Beebe Avenue), in Long Island City, Queens. Just ten
minutes from Midtown and open Thursday through Monday from noon
to 5 p.m., this little-known free exhibition space features many boldface
names from the personal collection of Emily Fisher Landau. Recent
shows have presented works by Jasper Johns, Matthew Barney, Jenny
Holzer, Cy Twombly, and Kiki Smith.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
282

Long Island City is also home to the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center,
22–25 Jackson Ave. (www.ps1.org), where the suggested admission is $5
and hours are similar to the Fisher Landau Center. Or, if the weather is
fine, visit outdoor Socrates Sculpture Park, Broadway at Vernon
Boulevard (% 718-956-1819; www.socratessculpturepark.org;
Subway: N, W to Broadway), in Long Island City, where there’s no admis-
sion charge to see the exhibits or the fabulous view of the East Side of
Manhattan. You’ll also find free concerts, exercise classes, children’s art
classes, and outdoor movie screenings there in the summer.
Be a Culture Vulture
Art isn’t the only cultural experience you can enjoy on the cheap in New
York. During the summer, you’ll have lots of choices for free outdoor
music (Central Park SummerStage) and theater (Shakespeare in the
Park) performances (see Chapter 14 for more details).
Film fans are also well provided for with a number of free outdoor screen-
ings in the city’s parks. Bryant Park is the site of a popular summer film
festival, usually featuring classic movies; check www.bryantpark.org for
the calendar and plan to grab a spot early and eat sandwiches from
’wichcraft (see Chapter 10) for dinner.
New York is also a great literary town, and the number of free readings
and author signings is mind-boggling. Bookstores such as McNally
Jackson in SoHo (see Chapter 12) and several Barnes & Noble branches
are known for their author appearances; free (or nearly free) readings
and lectures are also offered everywhere from the New York Public
Library to downtown bars. To see what free events are happening when
you’re in town, check Time Out New York (www.timeoutny.com) or New
York magazine (http://nymag.com).
Roller-Skate like It’s 1979
New York has changed tremendously in the past three decades, but arti-
facts of the past lurk around every corner . . . or roller-boogie past you
in plain sight. You can get a taste of what it was like when Michael
Jackson was still living off the wall and even Rod Stewart was prancing
around in spandex and gold lamé by joining the free summer skate circle
in Central Park, a New York institution since it began in 1977. Mid-April
through late October on weekends from 2:30 to 6:30 p.m., head to the
middle of the park from 72nd Street — your ears will guide you to the
action. You’ll see some people whizzing around on Rollerblades, but
you’ll be more impressed by the old-schoolers on four-wheel skates,
seemingly oblivious to the passage of time and jamming like it’s still
1979. This is the last refuge for those who still like to shake their groove
thang on wheels. Check it out before this, too, is legend.
Chapter 16: The Top Ten Cheap New York City Experiences 283

Tour Little Italy in the Bronx
Taking a trip to Little Italy in the Bronx is growing in popularity. Since
the downsizing of Little Italy in Manhattan, the area centered on Arthur
Avenue is the place to go for old-fashioned Italian charm, food, and
ambience. You know you’ve arrived on Arthur Avenue when you smell
the fresh-baked bread, stacks of bacala (dried salt cod), aromatic
sausages and cheeses, and tomato sauce. Spend the day browsing the
markets and having lunch at one of the local restaurants or pizzerias fol-
lowed by cappucino or espresso at a cafe. You can combine your visit
with a trip to the nearby Bronx Zoo. To get to Arthur Avenue, take the 
4 or D train to Fordham Road, and then the 12 bus east; or take the 2 or 
5 train to Pelham Parkway, and then the 12 bus west; or take the Metro
North Harlem Line to Fordham Road, and shuttle bus to Belmont and
Bronx Zoo.
Take the High Line
You’ll undoubtedly notice the number of cranes and construction sites
around Manhattan during your visit; new buildings have been going up
at a steady pace in spite of the recent real-estate slowdown. But not all
the new development is commercially oriented: Some spaces are being
transformed for the public good. One of these places is the High Line,
an abandoned elevated 1930s railway line that runs from Gansevoort
Street to 34th Street. The High Line District was created in 2002 to trans-
form it into a free public promenade, similar to Paris’s promenade plan-
tée (also a former elevated rail viaduct, now one of that city’s most
popular parks). At press time, construction was underway and by the
time you read this, the first section (from Gansevoort to 20th Street)
should be open. Check the Web site (www.thehighline.org) for
updates; it promises to be an incredibly special way to view the city.
Bike along the Hudson River
If walking is just not enough exercise for you, a good alternative is to
rent a bike and ride the length of Manhattan via the Hudson River Park.
You can bike from Battery Park to Fort Tryon Park near the George
Washington Bridge. Although detours along the way may take you on
and off bike paths, don’t let them deter you from a remarkable bike ride.
Along the route you pass the World Trade Center site, the far West
Village, Chelsea Piers, the USS Intrepid, Riverside Park, and the George
Washington Bridge. You can rent bikes from Bike and Roll, 557 12th Ave.
(at 43rd Street; Pier 84, Hudson River Park; % 866-736-8224 or
212-260-0400; www.bikeandroll.com); it costs $10 per hour, $35 per
day.

Wander the Streets on Sunday Morning
I’ve saved the best for last. This may not sound so interesting, but try it
sometime. The city has a special feel on Sunday mornings. You may spot
some jet-lagged tourists, a few college kids doing the walk of shame, and
smeared-mascara clubbers who’ve broken dawn, but the streets are gen-
erally deserted on Sunday mornings. Things are so quiet it’s almost
eerie. I feel as if I have the city to myself, and I find that exhilarating. 
Is it worth getting an early wake-up call? That’s for you to decide. Or it
may be easier to join the clubbers and not go to bed at all on Saturday
night. . . .

The Top Ten Essential
New York City
Eating Experiences
In This Chapter
 Noshing New York’s surf, turf, and dessert
 Eating a slice standing up
 Having your chicken . . . and waffles, too
N
o matter what your budget, you’ll find it almost impossible to go
hungry in New York. But do you want to eat what you can eat any
day of the week back home, or do you want a uniquely New York eating
experience? Read on for ten essential New York eating experiences.
A Slice of Pizza
The best slice in New York is a matter of perpetual debate, but most rea-
sonable people agree that it’s meant to be eaten standing up, folded to
capture the grease before it stains your clothes. Currently, a couple of
the best pizzerias in town are Brooklyn-based; if you’re truly committed,
make your way out to DiFara Pizza, 1424 Ave. J (at East 15th Street; 
% 718-258-1367; Subway: Q to Avenue J), in Midwood. A little closer to
the beaten path is Grimaldi’s, 19 Old Fulton St. (% 718-858-4300),
under the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge; note that they deal in
whole pies, however, so work up an appetite by walking over the bridge.
In Manhattan, the quintessential New York slice is served at Famous
Joe’s Pizza, 7 Carmine St. (% 212-366-1182), in Greenwich Village; the
joint is open until the wee hours, so it’s particularly satisfying for late-
night cravings.

Bagel with a Schmear
If there is anything more simply satisfying than a fresh, piping-hot bagel
topped with a schmear of cream cheese, I don’t know what it is. Many
people love it with lox, tomato, and onion; it’s one of the most popular
breakfast items in New York. You can find bagels and lox in diners and
delis all over the city, but the quality isn’t assured; go to the specialists
to get it right. Head to Ess-a-Bagel, downtown at 359 First Ave. (% 212-
260-2252), and in Midtown at 831 Third Ave. (% 212-980-1010); the
bagels are so hefty that I rarely make it through an entire one, but I love
to try. If you need it with lox, though, your spot is Barney Greengrass,
541 Amsterdam Ave. (at 86th Street; % 212-724-4707), if you’re uptown,
or Russ & Daughters, 179 E. Houston St. (between Allen and Orchard
streets; % 212-475-4880), if you’re downtown.
Chicken and Waffles
You’re out late, the sky is getting lighter, and you can’t decide whether
you want dinner or breakfast. You can’t resist the fried chicken, but waf-
fles sound good, too. So you try a little of both together — maple syrup
melding with hot sauce, sweet with savory. And that is the purported
legend behind this funky combination. If you’re visiting from Chicago,
Los Angeles, or Atlanta, where you can also find chicken and waffles,
you may wonder what claim New York has to this dish. Try its origins:
Its birthplace is said to be Wells Chicken and Waffles in Harlem in 1938.
Wells is long gone but a number of Harlem restaurants continue what
Wells started. The most popular is Amy Ruth’s, 113 W. 116th St. (% 212-
280-8779), where you can get not only chicken and waffles, but also
other novel combinations such as catfish and waffles and steak and 
waffles.
Chino-Latino
There used to be countless Cuban-Chinese restaurants in Manhattan,
most found on the Upper West Side. The boom began in the late 1950s
after the Cuban revolution and the beginning of the Castro regime.
Chinese Cubans emigrated to New York and opened up restaurants 
serving both Cantonese-style Chinese food and traditional Cuban food. 
A few are left, some pairing Chinese dishes with other Latin American
cuisines. Two of the most popular are the old-school La Caridad 78,
2199 Broadway (% 212-874-2780), setting the standard since the ’60s,
and Flor de Mayo, 2651 Broadway (% 212-663-5520), where you can
order an egg roll followed by Peruvian seco de res (beef stew). Try one
before they disappear.
Chapter 17: The Top Ten Essential New York City Eating Experiences 287

Dining in a Diner
Yes, I realize that the diner is an American institution, not just a New York
one. But New York diners are a breed apart. Largely owned and operated
by Greek immigrants since the 1940s (which explains the inclusion of
menu items such as gyros and spanakopita alongside the standard pan-
cakes and BLTs), diners in the city are the definition of democratic,
equally welcoming to the well-heeled and the round-heeled. The food is
reliably cheap and filling; the ambience is “only in New York.” They’re
also a dying breed. I enjoy stopping into wherever looks clean and
appealing, but two to check out are Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, 174
Fifth Ave. (between 21st and 22nd streets; % 212-675-5096), a luncheon-
ette where time has slowed to a crawl, and Waverly Restaurant, 385
Sixth Ave. (at Waverly Place; % 212-675-3181), in Greenwich Village,
which is a bit pricey and hipsterish for a classic diner but still retains
some old charm.
The Hot Dog
Let me be frank with you: I am not a fan of the street-cart hot dog. But
you can find the carts all over town and you may be tempted to try one
just to say you did, so go for it — it’s definitely a New York experience.
For a more memorable meal, however, take the subway out to Coney
Island and sample a Nathan’s Famous dog right on the boardwalk at
1310 Surf Ave. (% 718-946-2202). Just don’t do it during the Fourth of
July hot-dog-eating contest — otherwise, it may be memorable for all the
wrong reasons. If you can’t make it to Coney, another option is Gray’s
Papaya, 2090 Broadway (at 72nd Street; % 212-799-0243), on the Upper
West Side, or at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street (% 212-
260-3532), in Greenwich Village. The “Recession Special,” two hot dogs
with unlimited toppings and a drink, is the special whether the country
is in a recession or not.
The New York Cheesecake
The classic New York cheesecake is harder to find than you may expect.
Many city dessert makers have claimed to bring together the requisite
qualities — creaminess, lightness, the right level of sweetness — but as
with bagels and pizza, there’s a great diversity of opinion when it comes
to crowning the best. I have to disagree with the most common answer,
Junior’s, 1515 Broadway (at West 45th Street; % 212-302-2000); the
cheesecake is fine but not spectacular. Instead, take a taste of S&S
Cheesecake, based in the Bronx (% 718-549-3888) but available at
Zabar’s, Broadway at 80th St. (% 212-496-1234), and served by the slice
at Peter Luger Steakhouse, 178 Broadway, Brooklyn (% 718-387-7400).
Another contender is Eileen’s Special Cheesecake, 17 Cleveland Place
(between Spring and Kenmare streets; % 212-966-5585).
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
288

The New York Oyster
There was a time when New York was more the Big Oyster than the Big
Apple. The local harbor beds were overflowing with oysters and the 
mollusk helped feed the city. But you don’t want to eat an oyster from
New York Harbor these days (for obvious reasons). Instead, head to 
the Grand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant in Grand Central Station
(% 212-490-6650) where, since 1913, oysters have been their specialty.
Order oysters on the half shell from Rhode Island, Oregon, Baja
California, British Columbia, or even the waters of Long Island Sound.
With the Metro North commuter trains rumbling in the station along
with the cacophonous din of other diners and the magnificent tiled ceil-
ing of the restaurant above, try to imagine that you’re sucking down a
New York oyster in the days when you could actually eat a New York
oyster. It’s not as big a reach as you may think.
The New York Strip
The restaurant scene in New York is extremely volatile, but one constant
is the steakhouse. The steakhouse does not have to worry about trends
or gimmicks. Sure, there were some rocky moments when red meat was
considered a no-no by the diet police, but the steakhouse weathered the
storm and not only survived but thrived. Some of New York’s oldest
restaurants are steakhouses, and for good reason: They keep it simple.
They serve quality, properly aged meat cooked perfectly and presented
in a no-nonsense, no-frills manner. Places like Keens, 72 W. 36th St. 
(% 212-947-3636), established in 1885; Peter Luger, 178 Broadway 
(% 718-387-7400), in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, established in 1887; and
Frankie & Johnnie’s, 269 W. 45th St. (% 212-997-9494), established in
1926, all have their loyal fans. Visit any of the above and your New York
steakhouse obligation will be more than fulfilled.
Ice Cream with a View
The Brooklyn Bridge is surely on your New York itinerary. You can time
your walk to coincide with lunchtime (to eat at Grimaldi’s Pizzeria), or
you can wait until closer to dusk. Once over the bridge on the Brooklyn
side, head down to the river until you get to what appears to be an old
fireboat house right on the waterfront. Inside that structure you’ll find
the best ice cream in the city at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, 
1 Water St. (% 718-246-3963). The ice cream is all homemade and you
won’t be challenged by too many exotic choices. Keep it simple and just
add some of their amazing hot fudge to whatever you get. If you wait
until sunset, you can eat your ice cream with the visual treat of the 
twinkling lights on the buildings of Manhattan across the river. Not that
it needs the enhancement, but your ice cream will taste even better with
that view.

Ten New York City
Experiences to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Ringing in the New Year in Times Square (stay away!)
 Falling for a sidewalk sob story (scam!)
 Shopping in SoHo on a Saturday (don’t!)
 Experiencing a horse-drawn carriage ride (avoid it!)
N
ew York offers plenty of offbeat adventures that you may want to
experience (see Chapter 16 for a rundown). Here’s the flip side:
things, events, and places to avoid. Some of the experiences I list here
are commonly considered quintessential New York experiences. You
may, in fact, have a lifelong dream of ringing in the New Year in Times
Square or taking a carriage ride through Central Park. I hate to be a cur-
mudgeon and burst your bubble, but I give you the straight story here,
and leave it to you to decide.
New Year’s Eve in Times Square
You see it on television every year and now you’re here. This is your
chance to be one of the hundreds of thousands of revelers packed tightly
together in the cold to watch the ball drop. Spare yourself the misery.
Despite the happy faces you see on TV, it’s not worth the hours spent on
your feet ignoring your bladder and holding your ground in freezing tem-
peratures; the forced elation of blowing on a noisemaker at midnight with
half a million others; and dodging piles of trash and puddles of puke after
it’s over. Instead, make like the natives: Find a restaurant or bar to cele-
brate in. Or better yet, have room service deliver a delicious meal and
some bubbly for you and a loved one, and don’t go out at all.

Chain Stores and Restaurants
Oh yes, they’re here — and more seem to come every month. I’m refer-
ring to those restaurants with familiar names such as Applebee’s, Red
Lobster, and Domino’s. And yes, that was a Gap, Banana Republic, and
Old Navy you just passed . . . and another . . . and another. Chains aren’t
always such a bad thing; international brands (including MUJI, Topshop,
UNIQLO, and Beard Papa’s) are fond of opening New York flagships,
often one of their only stores on U.S. soil. But when you begin to feel the
pangs of hunger or need a new pair of jeans, ask yourself: Did I come to
New York to eat and buy exactly what I can eat and buy in every city or
town in this country? Or did I come here to experience what makes New
York so unique? And that includes the amazing variety of unchained
stores and restaurants, including bargain-priced ethnic cuisine and hole-
in-the-wall shops opened by upstart designers. Bypass the old standards
and try something homey, glamorous, or new. You won’t regret it.
Street Scams
If you see a crowd gathered around a cardboard box with one man flip-
ping cards, madly enticing innocent rubes into his game while another
guy scans the crowd for undercover cops, you may already know to
keep on walking. Three-card Monte is one of the most recognizable New
York street scams, so much so that I can’t believe anyone bothers any-
more (but they do — look for it in Chinatown). Beware of other petty
hustles in this striving city that bilk unsuspecting newcomers on a daily
basis. Those baby-faced kids you see selling candy for their “basketball
uniforms”? That guy you bumped into who insists you give him cash to
replace the food/eyeglasses/bottle of beer you “made” him drop? That
girl with a sob story about being stuck in New York, telling you that your
$10 can help get her home? Scammers, hon. Harden your heart and keep
your wallet in your pocket. Hey, you still have it, right?
Weekend Subway Rides
If you’re in New York over the weekend, you can only count on taxis and
your toes to get you around with certainty. Why? Because the
Metropolitan Transit Authority saves its most disruptive subway track
work for the less-trafficked weekends. Hey, it’s a 24/7 system and repairs
have to happen sometime. Don’t expect to zip around town by train in a
timely fashion. Instead, you may head into a subway entrance only to
discover that the station is being skipped, so you have to choose a dif-
ferent train line or take an uptown train in order to go downtown (or
vice versa). You may board an F train at West 4th Street and find yourself
Chapter 18: Ten New York City Experiences to Avoid 291

following the Eighth Avenue A/C line until Brooklyn, where it switches
back to F-train behavior at Jay Street. Or you may have planned to take
the express 4 or 5 from downtown to the Upper East Side for a brunch
date, and wind up late because only the local 6 is running. On weekends,
if time is of the essence, take a cab.
SoHo on Saturdays
I suppose there’s an argument to be made for intentionally shopping in
SoHo on a Saturday, but having done it more times than I wish, I cannot
imagine what it is. SoHo’s skinny sidewalks become jammed with
tourists and bridge-and-tunnel teenagers; the must-see stores (Apple,
Prada, H&M, to name a few) are completely crowded, with crazy-long
lines; and whatever charm that’s left in the area is totally lost as you
elbow through and dodge cars and cabs. Sundays are sometimes margin-
ally better, but forget about it if it’s exceptionally pretty outside. If you’re
visiting on a weekend, you can make the best of it by coming as early as
the shops open (usually around 10 or 11 a.m. on Sat and noon on Sun);
otherwise, save your SoHo shopping for a weekday when you can actu-
ally enjoy browsing and buying.
The St. Patrick’s Day Parade
On March 17, packs of suburban teenagers (with cases of beer between
them) begin arriving early via the Long Island Rail Road, Metro North, or
New Jersey Transit. By the time the parade kicks off, they — along with a
few off-duty policemen — are sloshed. Midtown becomes exasperating
to navigate, with parade crowds and blockades slowing down all public
transportation. The pubs are packed, and the already-high price of
drinks gets even higher. If you truly yearn for a bit of the Irish on this
day, for your own good, stay in, order a pint of Guinness from room serv-
ice, and listen to the Irish Tenors sing “Danny Boy.”
Electronics Stores
You may notice a wealth of “electronics stores” in and around Times
Square and Fifth Avenue or wherever gullible tourists frequent. Many of
the stores post banners advertising a going-out-of-business sale. These
guys have been going out of business since the Stone Age. That’s the
bait and switch; pretty soon you’ve spent too much money for digital
cameras or MP3 players in questionable working order. The people who
work at these stores are a special breed of shark; they work you hard to
take their “deal.” Don’t even get close enough to let them sink their fangs
into you because after they do, you’re usually theirs for the taking.

Driving in the City
I warn you about driving in the city in Chapter 7, but it bears repeating.
If you want a world of aggravation, rent a car, grit your teeth in the traf-
fic, play chicken with the taxis, and try, just try, to find a parking place.
And when you do, make sure it’s a legal one (read the fine print on the
street signs). Or put the car in a garage and watch your vacation budget
fritter away. (If you must drive your car to get here, at least stay in a
hotel that offers free or discounted parking.) With subways, buses, and
your feet, New York has the best and fastest public transportation in the
country. A car is a luxury you want no part of.
Horse-Drawn Carriage Rides
Pity those poor beasts of burden. They get dragged out in the heat and
cold with a buggy attached to them just to give the passenger the feel of
a romantic buggy ride through Central Park. But the horses look totally
forlorn, as if contending with Midtown traffic is the last thing they want
to do. (Can you blame them?) And they don’t even get a cut of the gener-
ous take: $40 for a 20-minute ride, $60 for 45 minutes, excluding tip. If
you want a slow, leisurely ride through Central Park, minus the smell of
horse poop, consider an alternative called Manhattan Rickshaw
Company (% 212-604-4729). The beast of burden behind the rickshaw
has two legs, and the rate is about $1 a minute.
Chapter 18: Ten New York City Experiences to Avoid 293
Getting your car out of the pound
If you come back to the spot on the street where you left your car and it’s not there, it
probably hasn’t been stolen — more than likely, it’s been towed. You can call the city
information number, % 311, or call the car pound directly at % 212-971-0770, and the
personnel there can help you track your car in the system. Or just head for the
Manhattan car pound at Pier 76 on the far West Side (12th Avenue and 38th Street).
Take a cab; it’s on the other side of the busy West Side Highway. The pound is open
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Mondays, until midnight on Tuesdays, 24 hours a day Wednesday
through Saturday, and on Sunday from midnight to 6 a.m.
If your car is towed, you should get it out as quickly as possible because they charge
you $15 a day for storage after the first day. Granted, this may be cheaper than what
you’re paying at a parking lot, but don’t forget that big fine you already have to cover.
When you go to the car pound, bring the car’s registration (if it’s not in the glove box)
or rental agreement and your driver’s license. Pound personnel will escort you to the
car, if necessary, to identify it if you don’t have all the required documentation. Oh, and
bring cash (or traveler’s checks). You’ll pay a minimum of $185 to claim your car, and
they don’t take credit cards or personal checks. You don’t have to pay the (additional)
$55 parking ticket when you claim your car.

The Feast of San Gennaro
At one time, this was a distinct and genuine Italian feast (see the films
Godfather II and Mean Streets for the Feast in the good old days). Its
decline has pretty much coincided with the decline of Little Italy, a
neighborhood that barely exists anymore. Now, the Feast is just another
overblown and overcrowded street fair with bad food (well, except for
the zeppole, which you can get at any city street fair), cheap trinkets
(KISS ME, I’M ITALIAN buttons come to mind), and games of chance you have
no chance of winning. Most of the original Little Italy residents have left,
but the ones who are still there make sure to clear out during the Feast
and let the bridge-and-tunnel expats take over.

For telephone directory information, dial
% 411 or 1 + the area code you’re calling
plus 555-1212. These calls are free from
Verizon public pay phones. Not all public
pay phones in New York are affiliated with
Verizon, though, and the ones owned by
other companies charge for 411 calls. It’s
also worth noting that Verizon has dropped
the price of a local call from 50¢ to 25¢ at its
own pay phones (except in some hotel lob-
bies and other places where out-of-town
visitors congregate). For more sources of
information, consult “Where to Get More
Information,” later in this appendix.
Internet Cafes
Many of the hotels I recommend now offer
the option of checking your e-mail even if
you didn’t bring your laptop along; the
alternative is one of the Internet cafes in
town. Try CyberCafe, 250 W. 49th St.
(between Broadway and Eighth Avenue;
% 212-333-4109; www.cyber-cafe.com),
open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 11
p.m., Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
It charges $6.40 for 30 minutes (with a 30-
minute minimum), and $3.20 per 15 minutes
after that.
Liquor Laws
The minimum legal age to buy and con-
sume alcoholic beverages in New York is
21. Liquor and wine are sold only at
licensed stores, which are open six days a
week. Most are closed Sundays and holi-
days. You can purchase beer at grocery
stores, delis, and supermarkets 24 hours a
day, except on Sundays before noon.
Maps
Transit maps for the subways and buses
are available free at token booths inside
subway stations and at public libraries;
bus maps are also available on the buses.
Free city maps are available at hotels
inside the free city guides. To buy maps of
all kinds, go to Hagstrom Map and Travel
Center, 51 W. 43rd St. (between Fifth and
Sixth avenues; % 212-398-1222), open
Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
Saturday 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. For simple
New York City street maps, go to any of the
bookstores in town.
Newspapers/Magazines
The four major daily newspapers are the
New York Times, the Daily News, the New
York Post, and Newsday. Two weekly
newspapers distributed free in the city are
the New York Press and the Village Voice
(both on Wed). The New Yorker is a weekly
magazine that publishes listings of local
events, news features, criticism, and short
stories. New York magazine, also weekly,
publishes news and commentaries about
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
296

the city, along with well-regarded restau-
rant, film, and theater reviews. Time Out
New York is an indispensable weekly serv-
ice-oriented magazine that offers dining,
music, and entertainment reviews, shop-
ping news, and insider advice about living
in the city, as well as an exhaustive compi-
lation of local events.
Pharmacies
Here are two 24-hour pharmacies, both
members of the Duane Reade chain: One is
at Broadway and 57th Street (% 212-541-
9708); the other is at Third Avenue and 74th
Street (% 212-744-2668). In addition, CVS
and Rite Aid have branches throughout the
city. For homeopathic cures and other nat-
ural medicines, try C.O. Bigelow Pharmacy,
414 Sixth Ave. (between 8th and 9th
streets; % 212-533-2700).
Police
Dial % 911 for emergencies and % 212-
374-5000 for the phone number of the near-
est police precinct.
Radio Stations
Find National Public Radio on WFUV-FM
90.7, WNYC-AM 820, and WNYC-FM 93.9.
WBAI-FM 99.5 and the cluster of college
radio stations at the lower end of the radio
dial broadcast an interesting mix of music
and talk. WBGO-FM 88.3 plays jazz, while
WQHT-FM 97.1 plays hip-hop and R&B.
Find salsa and merengue on the mostly
Spanish-language WSKQ-FM 97.9, classi-
cal on WNYC-FM 93.9, classic rock on
WAXQ-FM 104.3, modern rock on WXRK-
FM 92.3, light rock at WQCD 101.9, Top-40
and contemporary hits at WPLJ-FM 95.5
and WHTZ-FM 100.3, and oldies at WCBS-
FM 101.1. Yankees games are broadcast on
WCBS-AM 880, and WINS-AM 1010 is an
all-news station that provides traffic and
weather reports every ten minutes. The
Mets, Knicks, Rangers, and Giants are on
WFAN-AM 660, an all-sports station.
Restrooms
You may want to arm yourself with a $2.50
toilet locator map from www.nyctoilet
map.com. Public restroom facilities are
located in all transportation terminals
(Grand Central Terminal, Penn Station, and
the Port Authority Bus Terminal), in Central
Park and Bryant Park, and in the New York
Public Library and some other branch
libraries — but in some of these places,
cleanliness may leave much to be desired.
Department stores, museums, and large
hotels have wonderful restrooms (such as
the one in Saks Fifth Avenue), as does
Trump Tower at 56th Street and Fifth
Avenue. Some large coffee shops, such as
Dean & Deluca, Au Bon Pain, and larger
Starbucks, as well as some chains such as
McDonald’s and Houlihan’s, also have nice
restrooms. If you see a sign that says,
“Restrooms for customers only,” you may
have to buy a snack or beverage to use the
facilities.
Safety
New York is reasonably safe, one of the
safest large cities in the country. Still, it’s a
good idea to keep in mind a few basic tips.
The number-one rule is to trust your
instincts: If it feels unsafe, it probably is, so
go elsewhere. Don’t flash money or look in
your wallet in public; pickpockets some-
times loiter near ATMs to fleece unsus-
pecting customers. Modesty pays; keep
valuables (including iPods and iPhones)
out of sight. Don’t leave a purse or jacket
with a wallet inside hanging on your chair
in a restaurant; someone could brush by
and snag it while you’re enjoying your
meal. Although most hotel-room doors lock
automatically, it pays to double-check
when you’re coming and going. Subway
stations have off-hours waiting areas, usu-
ally near the entrances, with camera sur-
veillance; look for the signs overhead. And
in the unlikely and unfortunate event that
you’re mugged, don’t be foolish enough to
Appendix: Quick Concierge 297

resist. Give the mugger what he wants, get
to a safe place, and call the police.
Smoking
City regulations forbid smoking in all places
of employment and commerce, including
offices, bars, restaurants, public trans-
portation, taxis, and indoor arenas. A city
tax added to the cost of cigarettes makes
them quite expensive. If you’re a smoker,
bring enough to last your trip, and expect to
duck out to the sidewalk if you’d like a
smoke when you’re at a restaurant, bar, or
club. You’ll have plenty of company in
what’s sometimes called the “Bloomberg
Lounge,” after Mayor Bloomberg, who
pushed the smoking regulations through.
Taxes
Sales tax is 8.625 percent on meals, most
goods, and some services. Hotel tax is
13.375 percent plus $3.50 per room per
night (including sales tax). Parking-garage
tax is 18.25 percent.
Taxis
Authorized, legal taxis in Manhattan are
yellow. Yellow cabs have city medallions
posted inside the vehicles that have the
driver’s name and identification number, 
in case you need to lodge a complaint 
(or, heaven forbid, if you leave something
in the cab and need to track down the
driver). A taxi will cost you $2.50 just for
stepping in the door, plus 40¢ per 1⁄5 mile.
The flat rate from JFK Airport is $45 and a
surcharge of $1 is applied to all rides from
4 to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday. Most
taxis will accept credit card payments,
though not all of them are equipped as of
late 2008.
Time Zone
New York is on Eastern standard/Eastern
daylight time.
Tipping
In restaurants in New York City, you can
double the 8.625 percent tax to figure the
appropriate tip. Other tipping guidelines: 
15 percent to 20 percent of the fare to taxi
drivers; 10 percent to 15 percent of the tab
to bartenders; $1 to $2 per bag to bellhops;
at least $1 per day to hotel maids; $1 per
item to checkroom attendants. Tipping thea-
ter ushers isn’t expected.
Transit Info
For ground transportation to and from all
the area airports, call Air-Ride (% 800-
247-7433). For all transit information, call
the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA)
Transit Information Center (% 718-330-
1234; operators available daily 6 a.m.–
9 p.m.).
Weather
For the current temperature and next day’s
forecast, look in the upper-right corner of
the front page of the New York Times or
call % 212-976-1212. If you want to know
how to pack before you arrive, point your
browser to www.cnn.com/weather or

NYC & Company (the former Convention and Visitors Bureau) offers a
24-hour telephone hot line (% 800-692-8474 or 212-397-8222) that you
can call to order a kit, which includes a 100-page Big Apple Visitor Guide
plus a map and other materials; you pay only shipping, and you should
receive the kit in seven days. The guide, which you can order separately
(and for free), contains tons of information about hotels, restaurants,
theaters, events, and so on and is updated quarterly. NYC & Co. also

maintains a Visitor Information Center at 810 Seventh Ave., New York,
NY 10019 (between 52nd and 53rd streets; % 212-484-1222; Open:
Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m., weekends and holidays 9 a.m.–5 p.m.).
You can get information about current theater productions over the
phone through NYC/On Stage (% 212-768-1818) and the Broadway
Line (% 888-276-2392, 212-563-2929, or 212-302-4111).
For all transit information, call the MTA Transit Information Center
(% 718-330-1234). Call % 718-330-3322 for a copy of Token Trips
Travel Guide, a brochure that gives you instructions on how to get to
New York City’s main attractions via mass transit.
Air-Ride (% 800-247-7433) is a service that provides recorded infor-
mation about ground transportation from all the area airports.
Newspapers and magazines
New York City has four daily newspapers: the New York Times (www.ny
times.com; registration required), the Daily News (www.nydailynews.
com), the New York Post (www.nypost.com), and Newsday (www.news
day.com). Each paper offers daily calendars of events and usually runs
full sections of weekend listings on Fridays.
The best weekly magazines for information and listings about upcom-
ing events are Time Out New York (www.timeoutny.com), New York
magazine (www.newyorkmag.com), and the New Yorker (www.new
yorker.com). The weekly free newspaper the Village Voice (www.
villagevoice.com) has extensive listings with staff picks and 
recommendations.
The following are some of the more useful online sources:
 Citysearch (www.newyork.citysearch.com) is a comprehensive,
user-friendly site that lists tons of entertainment and dining
prospects. The listings are ample, and the reviews quite useful.
Citysearch is now associated with NYC & Company (found later in
this list).
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) site (www.mta.info)
provides easy access to bus and subway maps and information.
 NYC & Company, New York City’s official tourism site (www.nyc
visit.com), is the Web site of the former Convention and Visitors
Bureau; it provides a wealth of information and links, and you can
book hotels online with a few clicks of your mouse.
 NYC.gov (www.nyc.gov) is the official site of the city of New York.
It’s very comprehensive and clear and has a bunch of useful links
to sightseeing and entertainment information.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 301

 NYCtourist.com offers an excellent selection of very useful infor-
mation, although it’s a little more commercial than the other Web
sites I list.
 The Frommer’s site (www.frommers.com) offers much of the con-
tent from Frommer’s guidebooks, as well as online updates of
changes in the area since the guidebook was published. You can
also subscribe to an Internet newsletter that spotlights travel
deals and offers articles and service information on destinations
worldwide. Message boards are available for travelers to ask for
and share traveling tips.
If you’re looking for additional guidebooks on New York City, I can rec-
ommend Frommer’s New York City, Frommer’s New York City Day by Day,
NYC Free & Dirt Cheap, and Frommer’s New York City with Kids (all pub-
lished by Wiley). Also check out Suzy Gershman’s Born to Shop New
York City, Pauline Frommer’s New York City, and Frommer’s Memorable
Walks in New York City (all published by Wiley, as well).
