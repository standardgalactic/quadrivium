solid reputation through producing
software for the BBC micro. Even C64
owners may have heard about XOR,
the game that took the BBC fraternity
by storm. Soon all C64 owners will
have heard o f  Logotron when they
enter the C64 market with their new
1295 business software ranee.
There are three packages in the set:
a wordprocessor, a  simple database
and a spreadsheet. Nothing technically
revolutionary except where cost is
concerned.
Wordprocessing
Logot run Write 1.295 is a sophisticated
word processor with built-in spelling
checker and mail merge facilities, It is
simple to use. but there are one or two
tasks which must be performed when
you ﬁrst use it.
The n e w l y  lo a d e d  p r o g r a m
presents the user with a  hori/ontal
menu offering s ix  categories: edit,
option, print, storage, setup and quit.
Selecting any o f  the categories will
open up a sub-menu window showing
the full range of options.
It is best to select the setup feature
ﬁrst because, as the sub-menu reveals,
you have the opportunity to insert up
to seven codes which allow you t o

your printer may possess. You can also
select ASCII or  non-ASCII (normal
Commodore) output. the inclusion of
extra linefeeds o r  a  speciﬁc device
number and secondary address.
Under the sub-heading o f  setup
SiOntge, dual disk drive operation can
be selected and a  further heading
allows the screen display colours to be
changed. When all is as you would
wish it to be. the fourth option allows
you to save the parameters to disk to

use the Writer

occurrence of a speciﬁed word in the
text. Search and replace not only ﬁnds
the word but also replaces it with a new
word o f  any length which you have
selected.
Because t he screen i s  only  4 0
characters wide and mos t printers
work t o  an NO column width, the
preview o p t io n  i s  essential. T h e

appear just as they will on the printout.
This gives vou time to make those

It's a  good idea t o  check y our
document for spelling mistakes before
printing. This is a good option to have
and surprising on such a  low  cost
product. Unfortunately this option has
a weak point: the given dictionary is
ﬁxed: you can't add or subtract words
to cater for your speciﬁc needs.
Since the spelling checker only
checks the words which i t  knows,
'catalogue' spelled in  the American
way (without the 'tie') will remain
undetected because the word is not
included in the dictionary's 1000 word
database. All this apart. the spelling
checker does work Oven this small
limitation.
Storage allows dis k  access f o r
loading and saving ﬁles, sending disk
commands to erase old documents or
to format a whole disk. The loading
process is  further simpliﬁed by  the
inclusion of' a directory facility which
lists all of the document ﬁles onto the
screen. From the list you can load the
ﬁle that you want by highlighting the
required document name.
The nex t menu option is  print
which is  not only  for  accessing the
printer but is  also for  sending the
current ﬁle to disk as an ASCII ﬁle.
Here the special mail merge facility can
be called, but more of that later.

Such are the facilities offered by

text a r o u n d  e i t h e r  r e p la c in g ,
replicating or erasing selected blocks.
Regularlv us ed sections s uc h a s
copyright clauses or letter beads can
even be merged in from disk.
Special features allow all o f  the
special printer functions which have
been deﬁned previously. These can
include underlining. boldface tex t.
compressed text or expanded text. In
addition right justiﬁcation, headers
and footers, page format, tab settings
or centering can all be set. It is also
possible t o  append ﬁles forming a
chain of ﬁles should you be embarking
on a novel or similarly long document.

placed in the drive. Each time the letter
is printed a new address is pulled in
from the disk and printed wherever
indicated.

Thelext memory boasts about I9K
of space. I n  real terms this means
19.000 characters, or  approximately
3,500 words, or just under 500 lines
making this a valuable wordprocessor
for any user.
The Database
Filer 1295 is a simple database which is
both friendly and cheap. The hard part
is inputting all of the data which you
want to store.
Each F iler  database occupies a
single disk so the maximum number of
records i s  limited b y  t h e  s imple
equation of free disk memory divided
by the number of  bytes which each
record is  allocated. T he fewer the
number o f  ﬁelds i n  a  record, the
greater the number o f  records per
database.
In case I'm losing you at this point,
let rne explain ﬁlespeak. A database is a
catalogue o f  grouped information.
Usually the groups are individual and
company names which, like entries in
an address book contain various other
details s uc h a s  addresses. phone
numbers etc.
In such a database a record would
consist o f  a ll o f  the information
referring to one particular company or
individual. Fields are the individual
entries which make up a record such as
name, address, phone number etc,

One of the ﬁelds can be designated
as the key ﬁeld. This is the name under
which the record will be entered and
usually consists o f  the name o f  the
company o r  t h e  surname o f  a n
individual.
What is  k ept i n  a  database is
entirely up to the user when the record
ﬁelds ar e deﬁned. F iler  1295 has
several ﬁe l d  ty pes  t o  h e l p  i n
maximising the memory efﬁciency of
the system. W i t h  o n ly  250 bytes
allowed per  page. memory is  at a
premium. Using the full allowance of
25 characters per ﬁeld, a disk will hold
288 records. Fields can fall into one of
four types: keyﬁeld, alphanumeric,
numeric or data.
Once you've carefully entered all
the records in your database, changes
and deletions can be made or. free
space permitting. further deletions can
be made.
What y ou end up with is a ver,
useful ﬁle which can be used in various
ways. Files can be selected and saved
according to criteria selected by your
own needs. For example, if you want
to separate out all of the people %yho
live in the Leeds area, own a CM and a
car, you simply set these criteria and
let the computer do the rest. I f  you

as name and address for labels. this can
be achieved by  generating a report
sheet.
Within the limitations of ten ﬁelds.
each holding 25 characters, quite a lot
can be done but a lot of though has to
he applied ﬁrst.
To maximise memory use you can
use a coding system like binary for one
of the ﬁelds. If someone complies with
a particular criterion then a  one is
recorded, if  not a zero is used. The
result would be a number such as 1101
which could mean that the person in
question is married, male. childless but
car owning. To ﬁnd other married car
owners you could then specify a match
to equal M I .  The question marks
mean t h a t  any  character w i l l  b e
accepted for sex and parenthood. but
only a positive indicator for marital
status and c ar  ownership w i l l  b e
accpeted.
If you just want a list of married
people you can ask the computer to
ﬁnd a match for T h i s  means that
the ﬁrst ﬁgure has to be a one, but the
other ﬁgures can be anything.
Using a master chart these codes
can be converted into real terms and

you're not limited to mere ones and
zeros. If someone has two cars why not
record tile fact with a ﬁgure two?

The advantage of these facilities is
that detailed planning of the layout of

On this side of the pond. only Level 9 have stemmed the
Infocom tide with their own trilogy of futuristic adventures
now marketed by Rainbird as Silicon Dreams. These
adventures packed with illustrations and text descriptions to
match. tell the tale of K im Kimberly and his descendant who
are caught up in the colonisation of the Planet Eden.
The saga begins on the colonisation ship in Snowball
h c re you ﬁnd trouble. In Return to Eden you must escape
the avenging crew of the Snowball (I told you there was
trouble) and ﬁnd the robot city of Enoch only to ﬁnd in the
ﬁnal part the Worm in Paradise that there is something
desperately wrong with this robot serviced city. The robots

Activision's Portal is described as a computer novel in
which you return from a failed 100 year mission to ﬁnd that
all the people have gone. Where? Using Homer, a biological
computer, that's growing weaker and weaker you must piece
together the story before it's too late.
Activision also have the distinction o f being the only
company to produce two different games based on the same
ﬁlm sequel - Aliens. The American company produced a
multi-game version that follows the plot of the ﬁlm with
stages representing the scenes in the ﬁlm where the dropship
Sentinel

lands on the planet. the rescue attempt to free the trapped
marines, you hold off hordes of aliens as the team cut their
way out of the operations room, a mad scramble through the
air ducts, a race against time to ﬁnd and rescue newt and the
ﬁnal duel with the Alien queen.
Meanwhile. Electric Dreams (part of Activision (1K) has
its own version that captures the atmosphere of the ﬁlm but
not the actual plot. Your mission is to guide your six marines
through the rooms of the Alien infested complex. The action
is tense and incredibly exciting.
Covering up a Bad Game?
In that arcades the science ﬁction action is little more than
left/right/ﬁre games in which an unbelievable variety of
aliens arc destroyed by players of countless games. In fact
the science ﬁction label is stuck onto the strangest games
usually to cover up a poor game or rehash and revitalise a
rewrite o f an old one. Fo r example, Archanoid is an
exceptional rewrite of the original breakout but it's hardly
science ﬁction. Two exceptions to this are Quartet and
Nemesis.
Quartet is the sci-ﬁ equivalent of Gauntlet except that it's
a side on scrolling game converted by Electric Dreams in
which the player selects one of the game's four characters to
light their way through the screen.
Nemesis ( Kona mil is one of the best coin-op conversions
as well as being a top shoot-em-up where your ship and your
chances of success get better as you blast the enemy until
ﬁnally you have a high speed craft armed with lasers and
missiles as Well as two laser ﬁring remotes.
Rainbird's Starglider is one of the few games yet to make
the transition from computer to arcade as more and more
players grapple with the vector graphic tanks, missile
launchers stompers. walkers and ﬂying stargliders to avenge
the occupation of the planet No•enia;
Although Starglider has made the breakthrough it could
have happened to any number of quality shoot-em-ups such
as Novagen's Mercenary. CR L's Tau Ceti (the ('64 disk
version is incredible). Alligata's Trap and, of course. Elite
(Firebird) and Hewson's Uridium. Elite and Uridium were
games that rapidly set standards that other games had to
beat (but also copied) and will always remain two of my
favourite games.

YOUR COMMODORE november 1987

Firebird has since followed up its elites( success with the
double act of Chok) and Sentinel. Sentinel is an incredible
game in which you must use your brain and your reactions to
defeat the Sentinel over a staggering 10.000 battlegrounds.
The Sentinel stands on top of the highest peak in each of
these lands and absorbs all excess energy. Your task is to
teleport from robot shell to robot shell until you can strike at
the Sentinel while avoiding the Sentiners deadly draining
stare.
In Cholo you've just realised that mankind is trapped
underground. The robots were supposed to let you out once
the radiation levels had subsided. Now you have only one
chance of escape as you've managed to regain control of a
general purpose robot called Rizzo. If you use him well and
don't make too many mistakes you may be able to recruit
more robots to  light the rebels. Cholo is a little slow

compared to other games. but once you're into it you're
hooked.
The hardest sci-ﬁ game has got t o  be Accolades
( imported by US Gold) Psi-5 Trading Company. The game
features some impressive graphics and an easy game system.
I can even cope with selecting a crew from the 30 galactic
oddballs that you get to choose from but I always seem to get
blown up and plundered by pirates on my ﬁrst trading ﬂight!

Ogre is set to be the next computerised board game to
follow Autoduel and w ill be a  strategy science ﬁction
wargame between t w o  sides. O ne side must defend a
command post with a force of tanks, infantry, howitzers and
GENt's (Hovercraft), the other side has only one piece. That
piece is the Ogre, a living cybernetic supertank armed with
massive guns, anti-personnel mines and missiles. If you can't
wait for the computer version you may still he able to track
down the original board game. If you ﬁnd it, buy it!
Autoduel (Origin Systems via M icroprose) casts you into
the strange role playing world of Car Wars. It's hard enough
to survive in a world where you must build, armour and pile
weapons onto custom cars that then either plug it out in
arenas or battle on the open road. As you get the smell of
petrol. smoke and blood in your nostrils you'll want to drive
on until you're the best. Drive offensively, the life you save
could be your own!

Electronic Arts, the latest US software house to setup
shop in  the U K,  bave just released EOS (Earth O rbit
Stations). Seven missions drive 1 4  players deeper and
deeper into space as they compete to build bigger, better and
more proﬁtable space stations.
Depending on the scenarios which range from building a
dry dock in Earth Orbit to a race to search for life you will
have set number of turns or quarters to build set space
stations o r  race t o  have the highest technology level.
Whatever the mission your ﬁrst priority is make as much
money as you can to be able to fund the target projects.
Every space station needs a  command centre and
logistics module and then as many power plants, life
modules and galleys t o provide the people, power and
support for any of the money making or research getting
installations such as spaceports, chemical labs, weather or

you make more and more money ( hopefully) you can turn
some of your modules from commerce to research and build
up your tech. level which may earn you victory points and
allow you access to the mor e complex and proﬁtable
modules.
A successful player will also have to play the markets and
set as high a price as he thinks he can gel for the goods
created by his modules. Get this right and you can get ahead
in the space race.
The game is played through a selection of menus between
24 players that can human or computer opponents. It's easy
to learn but can be tricky to play particularly when you're
trying to judge how many life, power and galley points you
need to install a new module.

Contributions
Y
look out for new programmes, hints
and tips, articles and even regular
series. In fact if' you have something
that you think could be of use to other
Commodore owners we want to hear
about it.
So if you have got something which
you think we may be interested in.
How do you go about submitting it to
us?
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us. We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  t h e  nex t
William Shakespeare but it' you do
follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
1) I I  possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out On a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a mar gin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required — disk, printer
etc.
Your name
Your address
Your telephone number
4) The top of every page should have
the following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
For ex ample, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on ('64 interrupts.
You should put something like the
following at the head of the page:
Interrupts/J.Smithil
READERS SUBMISSIO NS
So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programmes? So why haven't
you sent them to us?
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and wr ite i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of  each page you
should put the word MORE if there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programmes.
9) Under n o  circumstances use a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programmes should be included
on either disk or tape. Make sure that
you S A V E  t w o  copies o f  every
program s o that we have a better
chance o f  loading them i f  problems
occu F.
II) Programmes under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.
13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides. We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  complexity o f  program,
presentation o f  program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between E10.00 and

introductions out of the way, and the
c ommode...00ps . C o m m o d o r e
show report, we can get down to what
this column is really all about. Namely
whizz-bang-techie-guru-magic (what?).
ICPUG's membership covers the
whole spectrum o f  Commodor e
computers fr om t h e  early  KI M- 1
through VICs, 64s, 128s and Amigas.
In our hi-monthly newsletter-come-
journal, we try  to reﬂect this wide
range of interests. However, we can
only print what our contributors write,
and so this policy does not always
work.
At a recent committee meeting, it
was stated that 95%, of enquiries we are
receiving are from people who already
have o r  ar e seriously considering
buying an Amiga 500. This leads me to
think that in maybe a year or two, the
64 and 128 will be reduced t o the
historical status of the PET and VIC.
Indeed, the muted presence of 8-bit
products at the recent PET show (or is
it Amiga show?) would tend to conﬁrm
this.
Before that happens, there will be a
transition period, where people are
using both technologies. As they move
C O MMO D O R E  U S E R  G R O U P
With the growing popularity of the Amiga, many
1CPUG members are using their utilities for both the
Amiga and the Commodore, which can lead to problems.
By Tim Arnot
from 8 to 16 bits, they are likely to
want t o  tak e their  wordprocessor,
spreadsheet and database tiles with
them. This is the problem which I will
expand upon this month.
Compatibility Problems
The ﬁrst problem comes when you
take your data disk out of the 1541 and
insert it into the Amiga's internal disk
slot — i t  w on't ﬁt. Commodore's
engineers, normally very clever people,
seem to have made the hole too small.
Being resourceful people, they made
the diskettes ﬁt by reducing their size.
Unfortunately the media now falls out,
and t h e  pr otec tiv e c o v e r  j u s t
disintegrates!
Thus, they produced a  stronger,
plastic jacket for this smaller disk, and
for good measure, threw in a metal
shutter t o  protect the surface from
baby and the cat The polarised casing
also stops people from ﬂipping the
disk, a deplorable practice anyway, as
it sure gets my 1571 confused! Then, to
add insult to injury, they did away with
that nice C.I.C.R. recording system that
we're all used to, and started to use
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
23
some alien mush called M.F.M. Just
because every other jack computer
uses it, it is no reason for Commodore
to start.
OK, so we've got to get our stored
information from the 1541 onto a disk
which is the wrong size, records in a
foreign language and has a  strange
directory structure. We  might also
have t o  convert fr om PETSKII o r
screen codes to ASCII, but given a
small a m o u n t  o f  pr ogr amming
expertise, that's not a real problem.
Presuming we know that the 64 will
read the 5.25" disk and the Amiga will
write the 3.5" disk, all we have to do is
make the 64 tell the Amiga what's on
the disk. You could also go the other
way if you wish.
For instance if  you use an Amiga
word processor and want to upload
text onto a bulletin board using the
Compunet modem, the way to do this
is best summed up in one word. Asyne.
(pardon?) Yes, Async.
Async stands for ASYNChronous
communications, a n d  i s  nor mally
associated with sending and receiving
data through the serial port. By this, I
mean t h e  RS232 p o r t ,  n o t  t h e
Commodore serial bus, which is  a
1

bastardised form o f  the IEEE-488
parallel standard.
Guess what? Commodore failed to
implement RS-232C properly on the
64 and 128. Plus/4 owners are lucky in
that respect as they have true RS-232
right up to 19K baud. Sc) some sort of
interface is needed, Examples of these
can be found b y looking through
adverts in this and other magazines. I
personally recommend the interface
made by Brain Boxes 0149.95, 051-200-
25001.
You will need to connect the RS-
232 ports in a conﬁguration known as
a 'null modem' (ﬁg. I). Basically this
makes each computer think i t  i s
driving a  modem and not another
computer. Refer to  the computer's
technical manuals for the pinouts of
the serial ports.
Rather than writing your own
software for transferring the ﬁles from
one machine to the other, there is a
public domain ﬁle transfer program
available which makes i t relatively
easy.
This is called 'Kermit', and is
COMMODORE U S E R  GR OU P
available for virtually every personal
computer under the sun. We certainly
have i t in all the ICPUG libraries.
Before you ask, yes it was named after
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
24
a small and lovable green frog!
So, connect the cables, boot up the
software, transfer the ﬁles and life will
be easy. Or will it?

Pegasus
ou've ﬂown a plane, taken a helicopter gunship for a
y
spin, dived to the depths in a submarine and gone on patrol
in a destroyer. Now here's your chance to ﬂy across the
waves in a hydrofoil.
This isn't going to be a joyride as you're at the controls of
the PHM Pegasus. It's one of the heavily armed patrol boats
like those on service with the NATO allies USA. Italy, and
Israel and it's your job to complete one of the eight assigned
missions. These range from target practice (although even
these shoot back) to the highly topical but almost impossible
job of escorting a supply ship from Kuwait, through the
Persian gulf to the safety of the open sea! The only trouble is
that the Gulf has become a war zone and ships are being
attacked indescriminately.
To carry out your mission you'll have to master the
controls and weaponry of the Pegasus so you can react to
any threat quickly and decisively. And at the same time.
control the overall strategy of the •mission as well as two
search helicopters and the supply ships from a separate map

The map screen is used to plot your course and speed as
well as those for the helicopters and supply ship. Then you sit
back and wait for the action. You don't have to wait long
(you can speed up the game clock by 128 times normal speed)
as enemy ships will soon be picked out by hydrofoil and
helicopter radar screen. As soon as you see a blip you leap to
manual controls and the instrument screen that shows fuel.
speed, compass, radar and weapons gauges as well as a 3D
view ahead and above that an enlarged binocular view of any
locked on target. When the target is in range you can either
take it out from a distance with a guided missile or try out
you shoot skills with the 76inm water cooled naval gun.
Either way you haven't got much time as other ships will
soon be in the area.
Pegasus lacks some of the detail of other simulations
such as  Gunship and Silent Service, however i t  does
compensate for that in action. Another recruit for your
collection of combat simulations.

Black Magic
I
moons before the civilised man came to be, class was a word
not known and honour was judged by magical status. As you
can imagine, it wasn't very nice being a normal person. being
turned into a one eye'd dancing polar-bear, for the wizards
amusement, and then left to dance around the village, only
to be caught by the local fur coat maker - not very funny.
Anyway on with the real plot. You are, as it were, a
normal person -  a resident in the once peaceful village of
Marigold.

The once lush green ﬁelds are now misty cemetries where
the bodies of Zargrim's (I'll come to him in a minute) victims
are dumped. The towns are deserted and only the demons
occupy the once happy homesteads.
This makes you very sad and angry (boo hoo) The last
straw comes when Zargrim, the evil warlock of great power,
kills your magic tutor, who taught you all that he knew.
(Which wasn't very much as Zarerim had nicked all the
magic books). So ﬁlled with anger you set off to kill the
mighty Zargrim, but as you pack your rucksack you discover
an old dusty parchement that tells the story of a wise old man
called Anaker who was defeated by Zargrim and then had
his six eyes nicked (yes, six) and placed randomly around the
land so he could watch in vain as the land decayed and
crumbled.
You decide to ﬁnd A naker's six eyes and place them back
in the sockets (cringe). Anaker, by the way, has been turned
into a statue, hidden away in the wilderness by Zargrim.
Well, what's the game like? Very good indeed, I haven't
stopped playing it yet. Okay, the graphics are a little dodgy
and sometimes dull, but the game is brill, with nice spot
effects and a hige playing area. this type of game is new to me
as I'm more of an arcade freak myself, but I just hope that
US Gold make a follow-up to it, and then a follow up to that.
Well, stop biting your toe nails and get this game, you won't
be sorry.

the game is this, the evil Doc Terror plans to get his slimy

a high security complex. throughout the complex there are
masses of doors which are all locked, and all need a special
key to open it.
You and y our centurion pals have t o  get into the

the Doc, sounds easy. doesn't it? Well I've seen the map for
the level and it's huge, and one thing's for sure i t ' l l  keep you •

following characters — Jake, Ac e and Max. Each hake
different skills, such as skills in the air, land and sea. Yot•
start off as a druid and must choose which skill you want.
Through-out the game there are patches of' sea, air and
land, in the middle of which are keys. So, if you are in sea
mode and need a key that is surrounded by air (!) then you
will have to go all the way back to the start and change your
mode! The doors show which key is needed to open them by
the keyhole, i.e. a door with a round hole will need a round
key to open it.

This game is a little bit like Gauntlet where you can have
two players involved at the same time. You can also collect
various weapons as when you have shot a certain amount of
nasties power-exoframes start to appear. On collecting these
you are given a fruit-machine type chance to pick a weapon,
press your button and a letter will be selected, with each
letter being a different weapon and if you are lucky enough
to get 'A' you will get extra strength and a random weapon.
Although there are only three ways to this game, they are
so comprehensive that they are more than enough.
I wouldn't say this was a game for shoot-em-up freaks, as
it involves a lot of thinking and memory, with a fair bit of
blasting as well. Yet another playable and polished game
from the main man Mr Crowther, Well, don't just sit there
picking your nose, go and buy this game, it'll keep you busy
for weeks on end.

Living Daylights
A
latest title with an open mind. No doubt you have seen or at
least heard of the new Bond ﬁlm, the Living Daylights, if you
haven't, sit tight.
You play the part of James Bond on a mission to rescue
the lovely Kara and help a fellow agent General Koskov,
But as you know, this will be no easy task.
You start the game in Gibraltar, training with the SAS.
They conceal themselves behind rocks and jump out
randomly and shoot you — don't worry though, it's only
paint pellets. But somewhere on this level hides an enemy
agent out to kill you, kill him and you will be taken to the
next level.
Before entering the second level you are asked to choose
a weapon from a list of four. Make sure you choose the right
weapon though. Here it's just more of the same shoot-the-
baddies, but not Joe Public — if you do shoot a passer by'
you'll lose points and a 'wheeeeee' sound is played. This
would have been better it' when you shot an innocent person
a blood curdling scream was heard (Friday the 13th style)
and it would certainly put you off shooting any more Ries.
You play the game • over eight levels, with increasing
difﬁculty, hut as I said before this game is almost the same all
the way through. Just shooting jumping and dodging, but
don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game at all, if it was 'a
bit more varied, it might have got very high marks. But as it
,
levels. It's a shame though, there were so many things that
could have been put in, for instance a lively car chase with
multiple weapons.
Oh well, there you have it, a great license that could have
been brill, but unfortunately is only average.

Commodore blasts from the past you can guarantee that
Impossible Mission will be mentioned somewhere. Now you
can add it to your collection and have Summer Games,
Pitstop II and Breakdance added to the bargain. Yes, it's big
value time from US Gold with their latest compilation Epyx
Epics.
Few American companies can boast the string o f
successes enjoyed by
exception of Breakdance, this is a collection of their golden
CM moments.
I admit that Pitstop is perhaps showing its age, if only
from the technical point that Grand Prix races no longer
permit refuelling stops. As a racing simulation it still has the
novel approach of fuel and tyre watching to recommend it
over other Pole Position spin offs. In addition there are six
real international circuits to choose from, either three, six or
nine lap durations and three skill levels.
Playing at Pro level against the computer is almost
impossible but you can always drag in a friend to play
against you. Could Pitstop I rs re-release have something to
do with bigger plans from US Gold? Watch this space...even
better read the news pages.
In case you've forgotten. Summer Games is the one with
pole vaulting, diving, the crippling 4 x 400 metre relay, the
100 metre dash, gymnastics, freestyle swimming ( 1(X metres
and relay) and skeet shooting. Eight events in all to test your
endurance, skill and speed. This is the one that started the
Epyx sports craze which has now taken in Summer Games
II, Winter Games, World Games and the new California
Games. I hope we'll see the rest of them on compilations
soon.
For me, Impossible Mission is the text book game. It has
everything from simple but tricky gameplav through to the
deeper level of puzzle solving. Add to this unsurpassed voice
synthesis with magically animated graphics and I  think
you'll agree this  is  the ultimate. Wit h  rumours that
Impossible Mission II will be appearing soon I may have to
revise my opinions, but until then this is the showpiece.
Evil Elvin Atombender has a plan to destroy the world
and several agents have been lost trying to foil his plot. Elvin,

has locked himself away inside his underground stronghold
and the coded keys to his hideout are scattered in pieces
inside the furniture. Guardian robots will make sure that
you won't get the codes easily as you race against time to
defeat the mad professor.
When I ﬁrst heard that Breakdance was being written I
thought it would be awful but! was wrong— it's dull. A lot of
effort went into trying to create an interesting game but it's
basically a dance version of the Simple Simon music game.
There are four elements to the full game. In the ﬁrst you
match the moves of Hot Feet, the local hero. Then you try to
outdance the Rocket Crew who try to dance you into the
river. The third challenge is against the Breakdancing king
and in the ﬁnal phase you can build up your own dance.
At £9.99 for the collection, the relative cost per game is
about C2.50. At this price it should be in everybody's library
or you really are missing out.

Defender of the Crown
T
demands on payment for our editors hairdryer (on HP),
when out of  an envelope came Defender O f The Crown.
'Yeah, great' I shouted with glee and carefully stuffed it in
the disk drive. After a few whirrs and clicks a nice title screen
appeared with glistening metal and smart music. I  knew
then, I was in for a treat.
I'm sure most of  you have heard of this game which
grabbed the headlines of most magazines for its wonderful
graphics and music.
The game is set in the 12th century in days of old when
knights were bold and all that stuff'. You can choose from a
list of characters who are different skills i.e. some are good
leaders but poor at sword ﬁghting or could be good at
R E V I E W S

jousting hut a grotty leader — it varies.
After the title screen and 'credits' have gone you will be
asked to choose the character you want by pushing left and
right on the joystick and a picture of the character and their
abilities will be shown.
This done, it's on to the game. You are represented by a
black shield on the map, which incidently is where a lot of the
came play takes place, You can transfer men from your
home garrison to an army which you can place on a plot of
land. When your move is over the computer then takes
control of the other ﬁve players and so on.
Moves available to you are either to go raiding, where
you can visit a local or not so local castle and attempt to steal
their gold, but being of  Saxon blood it's best to pick a
Norman castle. First you have to ﬁght your way past two
guards, and if you have picked a poor swordsman you stand
a good chance of losing. 
•
I must mention the shadows that appear on the walls as
you ﬁght the 'guard inside the castle, as they are especially
well done. You can also call tournaments provided you have
the cash. After you call a tournament you are asked if you
would like to joust for fame or for land. If you lose the battle
and you choose fame your leadership rating will be reduced.
or a piece of land lost depending on what you gambled for. It
you do manage to win the joust you are greeted by cheers
from the crowds and on your third win a nice little piccv
comes up on screen showing you on your horse being
presented with a prize from the King.
My favourite part of the game is the love scene. You are
alerted by the wailing of a Saxon maid, and two options are
available to you — either rescue or ignore her. If you manage
to rescue her you will be greeted by an innocent-looking'
maid, who ﬂutters her eye-lids at you. As you close in. she
takes her clothes off (you'll go blind: ED) and last but not
least you take her in your arms and give her a big smacker on
the lips.
After that excitement you are then rewarded with her
hand in marriage and the joining of  the two kingdoms.
However. if you ignore her, you are a coward.
My other favourite scene is the siege. Here (provided you
have a catapult
enemies castle wall with boulders, but this is quite tricky as
you have limited boulders and each shot ﬁred is a day gone
by. Disease and burning pots of  molten goo are also on
hand for reducing the enemies army, but to get them over the
wall you have to shorten the wall. You will then go into
battle and the player with the most men gets the castle.
All battle scenes and their outcomings depend on how
many men you have and what strategies you use. You could
try and outﬂank your opponent with your leadership or
choose to just stand and ﬁght among many other options.
Playing Defender of the Crown was a joy, there are so
many options open that each game you play is almost
different. The love scene for example is random — you never
know when it's going to appear. so if you were out of cash,
and a fair maiden needs rescuing it could be a good chance to
bump up your readies. The graphics are also quite brath-
taking and really build an atmosphere, though a lot of them
are not animated. The music, well this is very good. loads of
different tunes for each part of the gamme and very medieval
too.
My only moan about the game is the various bugs which
occur now and again. For example you could place ﬁve men
in an army, then suddenly have twenty, but the small bugs

you are not in control of the game. However this is no reason
not to buy the game, and quite frankly you would be a fool if
you didn't,

range is a good choice of shoot-em-ups. Code Masters latest
game is a blockbusting blast consisting of several mini game
parodies of old rave ups combined in a new and fresh way.
The rules are simple -  survive! As the pilot of a delta
winged startighter you have to negotiate 32 levels of Hell,
with each level consisting of four torture chambers.
The ﬁrs t challenge i s  reminiscent o f  a  stage o f
Salamander, the arcade classic. Tongues of ﬂame reach out
to lick round your ﬂavour-of-the-month craft. As the screen
scrolls relentlessly down it reveals an amazing assortment of
gun fodder attacking in miriad ways. From behind come the
backward ﬁring attackers: mean machines who care little for
obstructions in their path. It's all happening at once; it's hot.
sticky, frantic action. Make contact with a WOP (who he?),
your double ﬁre power is increased to triple power and you
can really give the enemy a roasting.
Another weapon i n  y our  armoury is  the Energy
Divergence Bomb which destabilises the kinetic energy of
the alien craft and vapourises them all. Your store of EDBs is
limited so use them wisely.
Assuming you survive, you meet the Guardian Zone,
which is  a Centipede style game, only four times more
ﬁendish. Still the attack waves descent towards your small
sweatpit of a ship but now centipedes appear spiralling down
towards you through the mushroom shaped space debris.
Here again you can enlist the use of WOPS and EDBs.
Now the calm comes after this storm as you dock with
your mothership to refuel and gain bonus points for success.

These points can be increased as you pass through the
convoluted tunnel. If you crash in either of these phases you
will not lose a life, so be as daring as you like.
Here endeth the ﬁrst level and although the rest of the
game follows the same pattern the style changes. Level Two
starts with mechanical arms reaching out and blocking your
path, making you swerve like crazy to avoid collision. Level
Three has bubbles which don't move but have to be dodged
around as you zip along on your way.
La zerforce is the best game of its type that I have seen in a
long time, I f  Jeff Minter wants to relinquish his crown as
King Zap, Gavin Raeburn is a worthy successor. So much
for so little, what a bargain!

The Astonishing Adventures of Mr Weems and The
She Vampires
t ﬁrst glance there is more than a passing resemblance
A
between this  game and Electric Dreams' Dandy. N ot
surprising really because they're both sourced by  the
popular but ever so slightly whacky Ram Jam Corporation.
This bunch have been on the games scene since the year dot:
for the most part hiding behind larger companies such as
Electric Dreams and Mosaic, but this time working for
Piranha.
Mr Weems is set in the distant past when there were two
kinds of living dead - Vampires and Chartered Accountants.
The only similarity between these breeds is their blood-
sucking ways. Nowadays there are only CA's and this game
provides a  possible answer t o the question o f  how the
Vampires went into a decline.
Weems is not a run-of-the-mill accountant, he is a failed
run-of-the-mill accountant. Alt er  ﬂirting with at heady

alternative career as a lion tamer, circus life lost its bite and
so he turned to vampire hunting. Armed with a rapid-ﬁre
garlic gun and a single smart garlic pill we join our dull little
friend in his greatest moment.
Deep in a Transylvanian chateau the She Vampires and
their cohorts are out for blood as they stalk Mr  Weems.
Nonchalantly, Weems blasts bats, Frankenstein monsters
and minor She Vampires with the same kind of detached
indifference which he adopts when he tots up rows of ﬁgures
in Company ledgers. This time it's his blood count which
interests him, if it falls to zero Sc) does he!
Hidden around the enormous house are keys to rooms
and secret passages. Vials of precious blood will replenish his
failing health and garlic bombs help to clear screen-upon-
screen of ﬁends.
Weems c an blas t away  t h e  corpuscle consumers
permanently if he clears away all of the ﬂashes in a particular
area. This renders the evil-generating tombs vulnerable to
his attacks. Each tomb-free room becomes permanently
exorcised, but just one unscathed generator will breed more
creatures of the night when Weems returns.
After eradicating rivet ﬂoors of demons, Weems faces the
wrath of  the Great She Vampire. I f  he has the tools he'll
ﬁnish the job, if  he is ill-equipped the She Vampire will
prevail.
At ﬁrst I thought this was just another Gauntlet clone
but it has a uniqueness which won me over in the end. On the
credit side, the game possesses that cut and come again
appeal which the frantic original failed to deliver. In the
debit column is the Spectrum style of graphics (but not as
ghostily ghastly as Dandy).
I think the similarity between Dandy and Mr  Weems
may have an adverse effect on sales that even a silly title will
tail to counteract. The cover illustration wins my vote as the
worst I have seen in a long time. A shame really because Mr
Weems shows a vast reﬁnement of style over its predecessor
and deserves to win a larger audience.

Mermaid Madness

 lice upon a time there was a really ugly, old, cabbage-
faced mermaid called Myrtle. who thought that at the ripe
old age of a hundred and ten, she would be left on the shelf.
So there she was sitting on the pier feeling sorry for herself,
when up comes a deep sea diver by the name of Careless
Cohn. With stars in her eyes she decides that this is her man
and promptly tries to grab him. Colin may be stupid, but not
that stupid and he dives quickly off the pier to avoid her open
arms. Foolishly hwoever, he hides under a wrecked boat and
gets trapped. Myrtle the Mermaid is horriﬁed and sets out to
rescue Colin.
This is where you take over — you must guide Myrtle, who

collect various objects, in order to progress. For example,
you must ﬁnd the dynamite to blow up rocks that block your
path, ﬁnd the use for the strange ankhs, and collect bottles of
stout to keep Your energy levels up. Also you have to keep an
eye on your heart, as this beats faster the closer you get to
Colin.
There are various sea creatures through-out the game
and any contact with these will reduce your energy little by
little.
If you do not already have this game (it was released a
while back by Electric Dreams) then go out and get it, as for
£1.99 it's good value. I must mention the music which is also
quite jolly.

minutes non-stop in order to compete in the 1500 metres, the
last event i n  t h e  Decathlon. O riginally  released b y
Activision, Firebird have given the game a new lease of life at
a budget price.
The events can be divided roughly into two sections —
brute force and timing. There are three running events; 100,
400 and 1500 metres and you must keep the joystick moving
from side to side just as fast as your hands will let you. In the
other events, not only must you run up quickly, but you have
to press the ﬁre button to jump or throw.
Up to four players can take part simultaneously either in
all ten events or just one. Points are awarded on the basis of
your performance t h e  longer you throw the javelin, the
better you score and as in real life y ou soon discover that
different people have different strengths and weaknesses.
Graphically, the game looks crude but that is irrelevant.
Decathlon plays superbly. It was- one of the ﬁrst multiple-
event type of game to be released and still stands the test of
time. Superb value at under two pounds.

What he needs is a hard-working person who can restore
normality and the Hotel's reputation. Instead he employs
Otto and Bobban, a pair of shirkers desperate for work after
their exploits in Clean Up Time.
The instructions to this offering are non-existent, a
deplorable habit which is common in the budget world. It
took some time before I could work out what the game was
all about. It was only when I discovered that there is a box of
goodies on the screen that I started to understand the nature
of the game. By rummaging in the box you ﬁnd a gun. a

brush and a bin lid which help to eradicate the litter louts
who run from ﬂoor to ﬂoor.
In the impossibly difﬁcult one player game Bobban
sleeps upstairs as Otto dashes about in a futile attempt to rid
the hotel of louts. The two player version brings Bobban into
battle and the possibility of success becomes more feasible.
The louts emerge from several bins in the hotel, and the
ﬁrst task is to select which bin it is best to close to keep the
louts at bay. Once a lid has been placed on the bin the real
clean up begins.
Armed with the gun and a brush the team can limit the
amount o f  litter the louts spread until all the rubbish is
removed. On subsequent levels the creatures and the aims
change i n  the kitchen make a hamburger, go ﬁre ﬁghting,
and beat the witch. In all, there are eight levels, more than
enough for an excellent value budget game.
This is a graphically interesting game and, in two player
mode. the game is tricky, challenging and enjoyable. As a
one player game it's a non.starter. I f  your social group

games would be one o f  battling against the odds, and
considering a twenty to seven defeat as being a pretty good
achievement.
Epyx Street Sports version of baseball from US Gold is
the exception to the rule, allowing plenty of interaction
before and during the game. There is plenty of opportunity
to improve y our team's performance and the excellent
graphics and gameplay make it the best simulation that I've
seen so far.

There are sixteen kids on 52nd Street and all of them
want to play. As captain you have to use your skill to select
the best possible team. Each captain takes a turn and then
you have the option of selecting your own batting order and
ﬁeld positions before the game begins.
None of the kids are great all-rounders and this makes
the team selection a fascinating part of the game. Julie, for
example. throws better than most of the boys on the team,
but is lousy when it comes to batting. David, on the other
hand, bats like a demon but makes a second-rate ﬁelder. The
skill of choosing is to select a team which covers its own
failings as far as possible.
When the actual game begins you have a large degree to
control over the action. You even choose whether you play
on tarmac or grass. When batting. your only worries are
when to hit the ball and when to leave it alone. Timing of
your stroke is important and not too difﬁcult to master
because you are given perspective and overhead views.
These two views are especially useful when it's your turn
to pitch. The ball can be swerved using the joystick in the
most unnatural Nvays_ A double swerve. or 'S' shaped pitch.
is possible and useful for confusing the opposition. The
speed of the ball can vary too. It inildit start as a slow pitch.
but suddenly' you can make it pick up speed as it nears the
__batting plate.
The main screen goes wherever the action lies. If the ball
is ﬂying towards the outﬁeld you are shown the landing zone
and it's up to you to move your nearest ﬁelder into the zone
ready for  the pickup. Being backstreet baseball there's
plenty of rubbish for the ﬁelders to trip over. Some of the
players are not so good at straight catches let alone tackling
an obstacle course!
The graphics are brilliant. Special attention has been
paid to colourful and realistic animation but the sound is
sparse though quite inventive. You even get the occasional
car horn blaring away in the background.
During a game you really get to know the players quite
well, and the next time you load the game you can select
different teams or try different batting or ﬁelding positions.
this is a superb game and well worth its price.

ﬂight simulator but also includes a second player and a
second plane into the action.
The action takes place just off the coast of a foreign
power where one player is based on an aircraft carrier sent to
monitor a radar base. The land-based player takes exception
to this and although the ship is in international waters a
plane is sent out to intercept. Flyer one launches its carrier
'based plane to intercept the other plane and destroy the
radar station.
Before you take to the skies you can set up the game b)
tweaking parameters that decide the number of planes each
player has, the number of hits required to blast each plabe
and the skill of the computer opponent if you can't ﬁnd a
human that can stand the pace.
You can arm your aircraft with a selection of close range
heat seeking missiles and longer range radar guided missiles
to dogﬁght with your opponent and also air to ground
missiles t o  tak e o u t  t h e  carrier o f  the r adar  base.
Unfortunately you can't carry everything you need all at
once so you have to decide which weapons you need ﬁrst.
As with any dogﬁght game you are in control if you're on
his tail. Get in range and you can cut him down with a
succession of missiles and then ﬁnish him off with cannon
ﬁre. However, he is trying the same tactics so you should be
ready to take evasive action if he ﬁres at you. This action can -
either involve rapidly changing your speed, direction and
height, or ﬁring a ﬂare or chaff to confuse the missile.
The action is fast and frantic as daring manoeuvres must
be carried out at top speeds. ACE 2 is a worthy successor to
ACE and is certainly set to become a high ﬂier.

Key Input
So far we have dealt mainly with
setting the computer to output data,
namely to the screen. Now. where we
want to develop a word processing
routine. initiallY we need to get the
computer to input data. namely from
the keyboard.
Computer keyboards a r e  v er y

represents nothing mor e than a n
electronic impulse. and what result this
impulse has depends on a program.

So, each key on the hoard can do just
about anything you want it to do. The
A key on your C64. for example. can
result in a capital letter A being printed
onto the screen, as happens normally.
or it can print a lower case a. if ‘ou

your printer. hum a tune. or whatever
you like.
All this  is  simply a  matter o f
programming. A s  1  hav e already
mentioned. in the normal state of the
C64 there is a program in the Kemal-
RONI which interprets every impulse
coming f r o m  t h e  k ey board a n d
cony ertS it into an ASCII-code. This
ASCII-code is stored in  a series o f
locations, called the keyboard buffer.
Whenever t h e  c omputer  h a s
nothing else to do, the keyboard buffer
Is emptied one by one and each ASCII-
code is executed. that is. if it is a so-
called p r in t a b le  c har ac ter , t h e
character is printed onto the screen, or.
if it is  a non-printable character, a
certain action is taken, like moving the
cursor, changing a colour, startine, a
new line, and so on,
All this is done by our good friend.
the 6510 microprocessor. But since
there is only one 6510 chip in each
Commodore 6 4  c omputer . t h e
question arises of 'how can all this be
done without the system getting into
an awful muddle about what to do
ﬁrst?' Furthermore. when you press a
certain key you expect to get the result
almost immediately! How can this be
done i f  t h e r e  i s  o n l y  o n e
microprocessor which has to d(2 this
and a whole lot of other tasks besides?
Interrupts
The answer to this important question
is 'interrupts.' This is a  fascinating
subject because it  permits an 8-bit
computer lik e the C64 which can
basically only do one thing at a time, to
pretend t o  do several things at the
same time. It works because the 6510
microprocessor is able to do things at
such tremendous speed. It's a bit like a
magician who does tricks by sleight of
hand -  you can't see how he does it,
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
37
mainly because he does it incredibly
quickly.
The 6510 has all the speed of the
best magicians. but. of course, it has
none o f  the brains o f  a  Houdini.
Instead it  does its  tricks strictly to
order.
Every 60th of a second it gets an
interrupt command which it  has to
follow, except it it just has executed a
machine c o d e  c o mma n d  w h ic h
instructs i t  n o t  t o  react t o  this
interrupt. This is called a 'maskable
interrupt,' because the microprocessor
can be stopped from reacting to the
interrupt. T her e i s  als o a  ' n o n -
maskable interrupt' which cannot be
aborted at all We will rClUrn toall this
I ater.
If the 6510 is not programmed
otherwise i t  executes the maskable
interrupt by interrupting whatever it is
doing at this moment and saving the
current address i  n t h e  pr ogr am
COLMICE On the machine stack so that it
can corn in f r o m  where it left off
afterwards. Basically, it is very much
like b e in g  c alled t o  execute a
subroutine. The only difference with
an interrupt is that the subroutine call
does n o t  c ome f r o m  ins ide t h e
program with a i n s t r u c t i o n  but is
hardware-generated,
Hardware-generated means that a
certain action the microprocessor has
to perform is  not instigated b y  a
program but u n  electronic impulse
coming from outside the micropro-
cessor, as from a printer or disk drive
or. as a matter of fact, another chip in
the computer.
The interrupt routine which the
6510 executes e\ ery 60th of a second
consists ﬁr s t ly  o f  r eading t h e
keyboard, That is. the 6510 tinds out if
a key has been pressed. I f  a key has
been pressed it goes through quite a
complicated routine which interprets

M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
Figure I
BNE = Branch if result is Not Equal -  if the zero-ﬂag is NOT set
BEQ = Branch if result is EQual -  if the zero-ﬂag is clear
BCC = Branch if the Carry ﬂag is Clear (A is smaller than B)
BCS = Branch if the Carry ﬂag is set (A is larger or equal B)
INC = INCrement contents of memory location
DEC =DECrement contents of memory location
CMP= CoM Pare with memory
CI.0 = CLear the Carry ﬂag
ADC= Rod with Carry
SEC = SE:t the Carry ﬂat!,
SBC = SuBtract with Carry
that keypress.
I s a id  befor e t h a t  eac h k e y
generates an electronic impulse. This
sounds Very complicated, but isn't. All
it means is that i f  any key has been
pressed. a voltage is corning from the
keyboard. while i f  no key has been
pressed. there is  n o  voltage. T his
means o f  course that the impulse
generated is exactly the same for each
- - - -
bet yy een keys?
the keyboard is  mapped into a
coordination system and each key is
interpreted by determining from which
part of  this co-ordination system the
impulse comes. It's a long process of
elimination, and the end result of this
is an ASCII-code. This ASCII-code is
then pushed into the keyboard butter
(location 631-640).
Amazingly enough. this is not all
the 6510 does every 60th of a second, if
the machine is in the normal mode it
also puts the cursor On the screen into
another 'blink-phase' so that it  will
appear to us slow humans as if  the
cursor is ﬂashing.
Having done all this , the 6510
returns from the interrupt, recovers
the address where i t  left o f f  and
continues with the task it was doing
before as i f  nothing has happened.
Quite amazino, isn't it?
Returning n o w  t o  o u r  w o r d
processing task, there would be little
sense in our writing a routine which
reads the keyboard per se. All we need
to do is to get hold of the last ASC I
code produced by the microprocessor
and then write a routine which tells the
6510 what speciﬁcally we want it to do
with that ASCII-code.
For that it  would be best i f  we
could have that ASCII-code in the A-
register of the 6510. For this I use a
very s imple RO M-routine, c alled
'CJETIN'. which gets one character
from the keyboard buffer and puts it
into the accumulator. I f  there is no
character in the keyboard buffer, that
is. no key has been pressed. then a zero
is loaded into the accumulator. This of
course sets the zero-ﬂag.
In line 340 o f  our  program I
introduce the opposite of the 'BNE'
branch instruction whic h w e  have
already learnt about. 'BEQ' stands for
'Branch if the result is EQuar. that is.
if the zero ﬂag is set.
What w e  want t o  d o  here is
obvious: i f  no key has been pressed.
which results in the zero-ﬂag being set.
we loop back to the 'OETIN'-routine,
until a key has been pressed.
Now the zero-ﬂag will be clear
because a number larger than zero will
be in the accumulator. This is of course
the ASCII-code we wanted. It tells us
which key has been pressed. It is now
up to us to do whatever we want with
it.
Exit
'Exit already?' y ou may  ask, ' We
hay en't ey en started yet.'
But t h is  is  v ery  important i n
mac hine c o d e  p r o g r a m m i n g .
Remember, tile 6510 has no safety-nets
and doesn't give any error reports. If
you set it on a certain course and don't
tell it when to stop it will go on ad
inﬁnitum. There might be no way you
can stop it, except by unpluggimg the
machine. So always ask yourself the
question: ' H a s  this  routine I  a m
writing got a n  exit?' This is  more
im p o r t a n t  i n  m a c h i n e  c o d e
programming than in almost any other
language.
Most other bugs you can iron out
in due time without much frustration.
But if the 6510 gets itself into a routine
or loop without an exit. you are well
and truly lumbered. All you can do is
unplug t h e  mac hine a n d  lo s e

basically working ﬁne. For example.
our typewriter routine would work
perfectly without an exit. The problem
would OMR arise when we want to get
out of it. Because we can't except by
unplugging the machine...
The exit I  have chosen for  our
program is function key I f  it has
been pressed the ASCII-code 133 will
be in the accumulator. So in line 380 I
c ompare w h a t e v e r  i s  i n  t h e
accumulator with 133 so that, i f  it
matches, the zero-ﬂag will be set and
the 6510 will jump to the exit-routine
in line I
•BEQ EXIT'.
In line 440 I do another test, this
time against decimal 20. I f  you look
onto page 135 o f  your user manual
where all the ASCII-codes and how the
C64 interprets them are listed. you'll
ﬁnd that decimal 20 is normally the
value for the delete key.
Since I wanted to include a deletion
routine in our  program, line 450 is
where the microprocessor will branch
to i f  the appropriate key has been
pressed.
Printing a Character
The routine in lines 470 to 740 outputs
a printable character to the screen.
There are two sides tot his routine -
ﬁrst we have to cony ert the ASCII-
code into a screen code which the 6510
can put on to the screen in the usual
way a n d  s ec ondly  w e  h a v e  t e l
determine the position on the screen
where we Want the character to be
printed.
If you compare the ASCII-codes
on page 135-137 in your user manual
with the screen codes on page 132.-134
you'll ﬁn d  t h e  f o llo w in g  m a i n
differences i n  the way t he various
characters are expressed.
Codes 32 t o  6 3 match exactly
ASCII-32 is always a space and that is
the ﬁrst of the printable characters in
the ASCII-range. After  that follow
Yarious symbols. lik e "(•;" and " 8 "
then the numbers from 0  t o 9 ,
then s o m e  m o r e  s y mbols  z ind
punctuation marks. All these are the
same i n  ASCII-codes a n d  screen
codes, which means that we can write
them to the screen unchanged.
From ASCII-64 onwards the two
lists diverge: The " A "  in a circle is
ASCII-64. but screen code 0. In short.
for everything that follows from 64 we
have to subtract 64 in order to arrive

the proper screen-code.
Ihis kind of thing is unique to the
Commodore range of computers. The
reasoning behind ills to be able to have
two separate character sets. Set I  is
meant for graphic purposes, ivhi le Set
2 is meant for word processing.
Since it is word processing we want
to do, we are interested in Set 2 which
es us capital and lower case letters.
Lines 280-290 switch the C64 into
the business mode or lower case mode.
as it is also called. ASCII-code 14.
which is one of  those non-printable
characters I have mentioned above, is
loaded into the accumulator and the
ROM-routine at $E716 'executes' the
code, meaning in this case, swith the
C64 into business mode. You get the
same result if  o u  enter the BASIC-
command " PR I N T  CHRS(14)" o r
press the Commodore and shift key
together.
"8E716" is a hex-number. So far I
have on purpose avoided dealing with
hex, because. unlike other machine
code programmers. I do not consider
hex an absolute necessity to successful
machine c o d e  p r o g r a m m i n g .
Nevertheless, at a  later date I  w ill
introduce you to the mysteries of hex
too. At this moment just enter the
number as it is given in the listing.)
If a key and the shift key are
pressed a t  t h e  s a m e  t i m e  t h e
"GETIN" routine w i l l  return a n
ASCII code which consists o f  the
normal ASCII code+128. Therefore
any ASCII code larger than 128 has to
be a capital letter. Anything smaller is
lower case.
The Carry Flag
So we want to know ﬁrst of  all if  a
number in the accumulator is smaller
or larger than 128.
This brings us to the second most
widely used ﬂag in the PS or  ﬂag
register: the carry ﬂag.
In simple terms, the carry ﬂag is set
if the result of a subtraction does not
go. that is. lithe result is negative and it
is clear if the subtraction goes, that is,
the r e s u lt  i f  p o s it iv e .  S i n c e
subtracting two numbers from each
other is  t h e  arithmetical w a y  o f
comparing them with each other, the
carry ﬂa g  serves t h e  extremely
important purpose of telling us when
one number is larger or smaller than
another.
If A is smaller than B. carry will be
clear. If A is larger than B. carry will be
M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
set. Furthermore, if A equals B. carry
will be set too,
Where there is a ﬂag there have to
be conditional branch instructions
testing that ﬂag. By now it will have
become clear to you that this is the way
we pr ogr am t h e  6510 t o  mak e
decisions. W e  arrange a  c ertain
operation which has an affect upon the
ﬂag we are interested in. then we test
that ﬂag with the appropriate branch
instruction and this makes the 6510
jump to the appropriate routine.
The carry ﬂag is tested and acted
upon b y  t w o  branch-instructions
which are "BCC" and "BCS". "BCC"
("Branch if  the Carry ﬂag is Clear")
asks if the carry ﬂag is clear, lives, the
6510 branches, if no it doesn't. And
"BCS" ("Branch if  the Carry ﬂag is
Set") asks if the carry ﬂag is set.
Or, to put it differently, " BC C "
branches if the number we are testing is
smaller than the one we are testing it
against. And "BCS" branches if that
ﬁrst number is bigger than or as big as
the second one.
In our routine we want to know if
the carry ﬂag is  clear after it  has
compared the ASC I I  code i n  the
accumulator with the value 128 after
the "CMP" instruction.
If carry is clear, it will mean that we
haie a lower case letter. and, as you
will discover shortly. ill this case it suits
us tO jump forward.
If carry is set, we've got a capital
letter o n  o u r  hands and want t o
subtract 64 from it. Then we go into a
second test, and i f  the remainder is
larger than 64. then we again subtract
64. The result will be a n umber larger
than 64. and if you look that up in the
manual. you will ﬁnd that in Set 2 that
indeed gives us a capital letter.
In a minute it will become clear to
you why I subtract 64 twice and not
128 once, Firs t let us look  at the
subtraction operation itself,
Subtraction
As long as you operate within the 8-hit
range o f  numbers, subtraction (arid
addition) is quite straightforward on
the 6510: You simply put the number
you want to subtract from into the
accumulator and then give the number
titi want to subtract together w it h the
"SBC" instruction, which stands for
"SuBtract with C a m" ,  The result of
our subtraction will then be put into
the accumulator. But why  subtract
"with carry"?
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
39
With each subtraction the state of
the carry ﬂag is taken into account.
Because o f  t h is  i t  i s  p r u d e n t
programming t o  use a n additional
instruction every time we substract.
"SEC" stands for "SEt the Carry
ﬂag", and this  is  one o f  the few
instructions of the 6510 which are used
to program the ﬂag register directly. If
we didn't do this and the carry ﬂag was
clear, t h e  s ubtrac tion w o u ld  b e
incorrect by one.
So always remember -  before you
subtract, ensure that the carry ﬂag is
set by using the "SEC" instruction!
Addition
Addition is done in the same way, but
now you have to ensure that the carry
ﬂag is clear. To do this, use "CLC",
which stands for  "Clear the Carry
ﬂag".
Unlike other micro processors the
6510 has no addition or subtraction
instructions which d o  not take the
carry ﬂag into account. So, play safe
and always set the carry ﬂag properly
before you add or subtract!
Both the add and the subtract
instructions can be given in  all the
addressing modes. That is, you can
give the number you want to add or
subtract immediately or you can tell
the 6510 t he location, where the
number is. in all the various addressing
modes which we have described in the
last three articles.
In Our routine we do it immediately
of course because we are dealing with
ﬁxed values. 
•
At this point I have to admit that
the use of "SEC" in lines 510 and 550 is
not necessari in our routine.
Can you guess how this exception
to Ole rule I gave yOU above collies
abour?
Well, eac h t i m e .  bef or e w e
subtract, we test &carry is clear. And if
carry i s  clear i t  jumps  ov er  the
subtraction routine. Therefore. when
it does the subtraction carry has to be
set! So when typing the program in YOU
can o m it  lines  510 and 550. Bu t
remember. in  most other situations
you can't be that sure and have to use
either "SEC" or " C U
In line 530 I compare the remaining
ASCII-code again with 64. This is to
test if it's a character in the range 32 to
63 o r  a letter in the range 64 and
upwa rd s
If it  is  a  letter then I  have t o

subtract 64 again. and now it  yvill
become clear to you why I subtract 64
twice in the case of a capital letter: In
this way' I  have a nice ﬂow to this
routine, otherwise I  would have to
make i t  j u m p  o v e r  t h e  second
subtraction which costs extra bytes for
a jump-instruction.
laving at last arrived at the proper
screen code we can now print the
character onto the screen.
Print Position
We print the character onto the screen
in exactly' the same way as we have
described in the last article by using
indirect-Y.
There is only one major difference:
Because of the nature of the program
we are writing it doesn't suit us simply
to increment the index to arrive at the
next position. Instead we prefer to
have the exact current position always
in "SCREENMEM" and "SCREEN-
COL". This is useful for when we want
to design all sorts of additional input
routines, like cursor-left, cursor-right.
cursor-up. cursor-down and s o on.
Using indexed-Y would make it too
complicated.
But because o f  this we have to
ensure that Y contains 0 whenever we
output a character. This is done in line
600, and you might think that this is
not really necessary since we haven't
used the Y register anywhere else.
But remember t h e  " G E T I N "
routine at the beginning! Most ROM
routines use all o f  the registers and
thus corrupt them. So we can't take it
for granted that Y will still contain 0
after i t  h a s  r etur ned f r o m  t h e
"G ETIN" routine.
This is another important point:
Always be aware that ROM routines
(as well as  subroutines written by
yourself) use and corrupt registers. So
if you need a  certain variable, you
might have to save it before calling on
the ROM , routine and restore i t
afterwards! Of course, in our case we
don't have to save Y since we know
that it always has to be 7ero when we
print it.
Counting Upsards
The overall gist of our print routine is
that we want to print a character to a
certain position and then update our
pointer-locations ("SCREENIVILM"
and -
M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
the next print-position. Since we write
in our culture from left to write the
next print position is one more than
the former one. I n other words, we
count upwards.
Again because of the limitations of
the 6510 this is not as straightforward
as it should be. Sure, as long as we are
within the N-bit range there is  n o
problem. W e  jus t increment t h e
location or  register by one. But the
moment we arrive at 256 it will o f
course overﬂow, which means that the
location or  register notches back to
-
This is where the high-byte of the
number we are dealing with comes in.
Every time we reach 256 (or 01, the
high-byte has to be incremented by
one.
This is not done a utomatica Ify by
the mic r o processor. I t  has t o  be
pro,gra in med!
So, in line 670 we increment the
low-byte of  -
we test the 7ero-ﬂag. As long as the
result o f  the for mer  operation is
between I and 255. the 7ero-ﬂag will be
clear. Therefore BNIi branches us over
the f o llo w in g  ins tr uc tion w h ic h
increments t h e  h i g h - b y t e  o f
"SCREENMEM".
Only when we reach the crucial 256
(or 0) point will the zero-ﬂag be set.
Now it won't branch and the high-byte
of " S C R E E N M E M ' '  w i l l  b e
incremented (line 6901.
Lines 710 to 730 do the same thing
with "SCREENCOL". and then our
routine is ﬁnished. We junm back to
the "G ETIN" routine (lines 720 or 740
respectively. depending upon the high-
byte having to be incremented or not)
in order to await the next keypress and
repeat the whole process.
Deletion
The deletion routine which follows is
in a way more straightforward than the
print routine. All we want to do is to
decrement our print position by one
and print a space over the character
which we want to delete. (In a later
article I  w i l l  giv e y o u  a  m o r e
sophisticated deletion routine which is
similar to the one used when you press
the delete key normally. But for the
time being this one will sufﬁce.)
To start the routine it is prudent to
build in a safety catch. After all. we
don't w ant  i t  t o  b e  able t o  g o
backwards a d  inﬁnitum and write
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
40
spaces into all sorts of locations. So we
Wil 111 to prevent the deletion routine
from going o‘ er the beginning of the
screen.
In lines ;2() to 870 I  tested the
current screen-position against t he
beginning of the screen, which is 1024.
If the two halves are equal, the routine
jumps straight back to "GE .I N " .  that
is. no deletion-action is taken.
Because I  compare t w o  16-bit
numbers with each other I have to do
the comparison in two goes. First I
compare the two low-bYtes. I f  the
don't compare I will k now already that
it isn't at the beginning oldie screen. In
line K40 the zero-ﬂag will he dear and
it will jump straight to the beginning of
the deletion routine.
If. on the other hand, the two low-
bytes a r e  equal t h is  i s  s till n o t
conclusive evidence that I am at the
beginning of the screen. So I now hay e
to test the two high-b> tes. If they to()
are equal, then I know forsu re that it is
at the beginning of the screen.
Counting Dmkm%ards
Now we want to decrement the screen
position by One so that we can print the
space and thus erase the former letter.
Counting downyva rds' on the 6510
is even more involved than upwards. it
we arc dealing with a 16-bit number.
First I  load the low-byte into the
accumulator in order to test the zero-
ﬂag. If the zero-ﬂag is clear, that is. if
the low-byte is between land 255. then
I need only to decrement the low-byte.
But if the zero-ﬂag is clear, that is,
the low-byte contains O. then I have to
decrement the high-byte as well as the
low-byte.
Finally
The rest of the deletion Win ine and I he
main exit of our program in line 1110
should be clear.
Listing I gives you the whole of the
program I have described in this article
and in ﬁgure I I give you a list of the
instructions we have dealt with in this
article and in the last one.
When you try the whole program
out you will ﬁnd that rather irritatinglY
something is  missing: There is  n o

add a cursor to our routine, and an

Surely there can't be that many kicks You can perform?
Well there are eleven ways to score and each combination of

difﬁcult being the Doda. To complete this move you have to
bounce the ball with an outside kick onto your head and then
kick the ball back with an outside kick from your other foot!

After beating your feet on the beach you go on to ride the
rollers of the Paciﬁc. 'Surﬁng' is a passion for Californians
and catching a wave is almost a religion. The massive rollers
curl as they break forming a tube and it's the aim of every
surfer to ride inside the tube. High scores can be achieved for
this trick and you can also perform leaps, catch air by just
letting your 'woody' overlap the crest of the wave or perform
daring 360° turns.
At the end of each turn a group of beach bums offer their
opinion of your run and a score is averaged out from this.
'Roller Skating' o n  the promenades o f  Californian
beaches is  hazardous because o f  all the junk  scattered
around. In this simulation you have to leap over all of the
obstacles thrown in your path. If you have the aforethought
and grace to execute a tasteful spin as you jump, your point
score is boosted. Beach balls, cracks, uneven surfaces and
junk food containers have all to be negotiated before you
complete the course.

wheelie your way along the straights and perform superb
leaps from the tops of the highest ramps.

O
amaze me about computers is the way
they appear to have intelligence. The
more y o u  g e t  in v o lv e d  w i t h
programming the more you realise
what an illusory phenomenon this is.
The s imples t w a y  o f  b u ild in g
'intelligence' into your programmes is
by making the computer appear to
respond on a personal level:
10 INPUT " ( CLR,DO WN,DO WN)
HELLO, WHAT 'S YOUR F U LL
NAME":NAMES
20 IF N AMES- - "  THEN 10
30 ? " 0 1 i,  IT'S YO U ";NAMES:'',
I'VE H E A R D  A  L O T  ABO U T
YOU!"
When you type in this program,
remember that the characters in the
square brackets are not entered as you
see them here. After  opening the
quotation marks, ignore the square
brackets completely and hold down
the S H I F T  k e y  a n d  p r e s s
CLR/HOME. This will give a reversed
out heart shape.
Next, you press the cursor down
key to give a reversed out letter Q and
then press again for a second Q. When
the program runs, this will cause the
computer to clear the screen and move
down two lines before printing out the
question. F o r  more information on

page in this month's issue.
I hav e used the wor d I N PU T
instead of PRINT at the beginning of
the line and so when the program is
RUN the computer will know that
something will be entered later via the
keyboard. Af t e r  the question, t he
semi-colon prevents t h e  computer
from jumping down to the next line. In
response to the INPUT command and
the semi-colon the computer will ﬁnish
off your question with a question mark
and the cursor will reappear and ﬂash
at the end of the line.
The program is still running at this
point but the computer is waiting for a
response from the user, We want the
computer to 'remember' what is typed
in, so we have to tell it to store the
answer somewhere. We have seen that
the computer stores information as a
variable but so far these have only been
numbers. This time the variable will be
a series of letters_
Variable Questions
For s tor ing s uc h a n  input ,  t h e
computer has a special kind of variable
known as a string which is indicated by
a Variable name (NAME) and this is
labelled as a letter store by adding a.
dollar sign ($) after it.
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987

Number variables, or the corrrect
term, numer ic  variables, c a n  b e
directly assigned i n  a  pr ogr am
(A= 125) and strings c an als o b e
direetly assigned: NAMES="ERIC".
Notice that the string of characters is
placed inside quotation marks. When
a string is INPUT from the keyboard
the c omputer  assumes t h a t  t h e
response has quotation marks around
it, so you don't have to bother to put
them in.
After R ET U R N is  pressed the
computer checks t o  s ee whether
something was entered by  executing
line 20. h e  IF /T HEN command is
fairly self-explanatory. lithe contents
of NAMES has nothing between the
quotes THEN the program will loop
back to rerun ﬁne 10.
If something has been typed in, the
program then executes the ﬁnal line_
This is  simply a  PRINT  statement
modiﬁed t o  insert the name in the
middle. Once again semi-colons are
used to force the computer to keep
printing on the same line. To see the
effect, erase everything after the ﬁrst
semi-colon and enter two new lines:
40 PRINT NAMES S:
50 PR I N T " .  I'VE HEARD A LOT

After running this to see that the
result is the same as before, try erasing
the semi-colons to see what effect they
had
Once you have created a string
there are special commands which
enable you to manipulate it in various
ways:
10 AS="YOUR COMMODORE"
20 BS=LEFTS(AS,3)
30 CS=RIGHTS(AS.I)
40 DS=MIDS(A$.4.8)
50 ES=BS+ DS+CS
60 ?A$:?Il$:?CS:?DS
70 9-9.9
After line 10 sets up AS, line 20
saves the three leftmost characters as a
new string, BS. Similarly, CS becomes
the single letter to the extreme right of
AS.
Line 4 0  takes a  little more
understanding. It tells the computer to
save an internal string from A$ which
starts at the fourth letter and takes
eight characters in all. D$ therefore
consists of the row of letters from the R
of 'Your' up to and including the D.
Line 50 shows how strings can be
added. This is not like adding numbers
together. because one string is abutted
onto the end of another. It's rather like
saying that 2+5+6 = 256! Strings can
only be added, using any other
mathematical operator other than plus
will produce a TYPE MISMATCH
ERROR message.
We can use string manipulation in
our original program. Add this:
21 A=I:B=0
22 FOR C=1 TO LEN(NAMES)
23 IF MIDS(NAMES.C.I)=CHRS(32)
THEN PARTS(A)=MIDS(NAME
$.13+1.C-1-B):B=C:A=A+ 1
24 NEXT C
25 PARTS(A)=RIGHTS(NAMES,
LEN(NAMES)-B)
30 ?"OH, IT'S YOU "PARTS( I);".
rvE HEARD A  L OT ABOUT
YOU!"
Forget line 21 for the moment and
concentrate on 22. We're trying to split
a full name into forename, middle
name(s) and surname. When we write
our names we denote the end of one
word and the beginning of another by
leaving a space between them. If we
search along NAMES for a space we
B A S IC  T U T O R I A L
know that all the characters before the
space form a part of the full name.
How Long is it?
Several people may use this program,
so we don't know how long each name
will be. Fortunately BASIX includes a
way of calculating this. The keyword
LEN will return the length o f any
strine mentioned i n  brackets after
it. We use this in line 22 to determine
the parameters in a FOR/NEXT loop
which will repeat as many times as
there are characters in NAMES.
In line 23 we use MIDS to test each
character in turn to see if it's a space.
Instead of specifying which character
the MID$ starts with, we let the loop
do this by using the current value of C.
and because only one character is
examined a t  a  time w e  get the
expression M I  DS(NAMES,C.1). I f
this doesn't equal a space which has a
character value of 32. ie CH RS(32), the
program ignores line 23 and jumps to
line 24. If it is a space THEN several
things happen.
First of all a new string is formed.
You'll notice that PARTS is followed
by (A). As the value of A changes we
get a series of new strings: PART$(1),
PARTS(2) etc. Whis is known as an
array. Each string, called an element,
in the array has the same string name
but the value in brackets denotes that
each string is in fact different from all
the others. The number in brackets can
only range from zero to nine unless we
tell the computer otherwise.
When the ﬁrst space is met A has
the value of I as speciﬁed in line 21 so
PARTS( ) takes the result of the MI DS
expression calculated on the other
side o f the equals sign. Let's study
how this formula is derived.
A space has been found a t
character number C of the name. This
part o f the name stretches from the
beginning of NAMES to the character
before the space which means the last
letter's position is the space's position
minus one, that i s  C-1. Fo r  the
forename t h i s  w o u l d  m e a n
PARTS( )= M I M N  A M ES, 1,C
where does the B come in?
Let's see what happens with the
second name. Again the last character
will be the one before the next position
(C-1) but the name starts somewhere in
the middle o f NAMES. The actual
position is the last space position plus
one. I f  we calculate this when we
separate off the ﬁrst name with the
YOUR (70MMODORF november 1987
47
expression B C  we can use B+ I as the
start of the second name. This makes
MIDS(NAMES,B+,C-1) but C-I gives
the total number of characters from
the beginning o f  NAMES t o  the
character before the second space.
that's too many, as we only want the
number of characters from the last
value of C to the current value of C.
Luckily, we have stored the last
value of C when we said B=C so if we
subtract B from the current value of C
we get the length of the second name.
This includes the space at the end of
the second name, so we still have to
substract o n e , hence w e  g e t
MIDS(NAMES,B+1,C-I-B).
What value do we give B to start
with? Remember I said earlier that the
ﬁrst name could be given by the
expression MIDS(NAMES,LC-1). I f
we substitute a  zero f o r  B  i n
MIDS(NAMES,B+1,C-1-B) w e  g e t
MIDS(NAMES,0+1,C-1-0) which
simpliﬁes t o  MIDSNAMES,I,C-1).
Eureka! We have the magic formula
which covers all cases if B is given an
initial value of zero (as speciﬁed in line
21).
What happens when we reach the
end o f the name? Since there is no
space at the end the I F  MIDS is a
space* condition is not fulﬁlled so n o
string is set up for the surname. To
overcome this we have line 25:
25 PARTS(A)=RIGHTS(NAMES,
LEN(N AM ES )-B
All we have done here is to chop off
the end of NAMES from the last value
of C which was stored as variable B.
this is subtracted from the full length
of NAMES to give the length of the
surname: LEN(NAMES)-B. a s the
surname goes to the end of the string
we can isolate it by taking the RIGHTS
to th e  length o f  the surname:
RIG [ITS NA M ES EN (N A MES)-13).
Finally. I've modiﬁed the last line
to address the user by ﬁrst forename
only: PARTS(1).
We can now use what we've found
to make the computer appear even
more human:
40 I F  A  >I T H E N  ? " Y O U
HAVE";A:"PARTS T O  YOU R
NAME,"J'ARTS(
50 ?"GIVE MY REGARDS TO THE
REST OF THE ";PARTS(A);

This is not a perfect program, so
play around with it this month and
we'll see how  t o  error tr ap i n  a

A Valuable Utility
Before we jump into the Deep End I
have two more things to say. First of
all, if you type LIST, long programmes
zoom up the screen at a ridiculous
speed. Pressing CTRL as it lists does
help a little, but the lazy way to get a
slow listing is to use this little tip. Type
in POKE 56325,1. This does have the
side-effect of making the cursor a bit
hyperactive but you should be able to
type in LIST.
The list will procede at a very low
rate of knots and when you want to
examine a  line you can hold down
CTRL and We listing will pause for a
long time. T o  reset 56325 press
RUN/STOP and REST O RE Wh y
spend a fortune on a utility cartridge
when it's so easy to slow list?
Finally, I'd like to remind you that

In at the Deep End
When you have a lot of screen displays
in a program, typing in all those cursor
down and cursor right symbols gets
boring and confusing. The PRINT AT
command is  the only  thing I  envy
about Sinclair Basic. You can get a
similar effect on the C64. First set up
two strings:
10 F O R  A 5

20 DS="(HOME)":FOR A= IT024:D
S+"(DOWN):NEXT
If you want t o  see what these
strings look like, run the program and

pick out the bits of these strings that we
need:

Now your text can be printed at a

recently took me through an extensive demonstration of
WordPerfect, a wordprocessor whose functionality no other
Amiga software package can match so far. The ﬁnished
product should be available from your local dealer by the
time you read this.
I had heard about WordPerfect on the IBM PC, the best
selling wordprocessor - 15% of the UK market. I heard that
Sentinel has target sales of three million pounds this year
(you w ill have n o  trouble getting a  t  sign o n  this
wordprocessor - see below). I heard that WordPerfect was
becoming a standard, number one in the charts, used en
maw by Marks and Spencers no less.
I also heard that on the PC WordPerfect 4.2 costs 1:425
but that Sentinel employ  twic e the s taff supporting
WordPerfect users than selling it to the non-WordPerfect
users_ The Amiga version is WordPerfect 4.1 and costs.f.295.
I also heard that there is an educational price of £76 for
training (E135 for administration departments).

Sentinel are lucky, selling, WordPerfect and the associated
family of software products in the UK is 'fun' for them.
Everyone in the company uses them and looks forward to
the next package from across the Atlantic. The latest Amiga
version of WordPerfect arrived to great excitement while I
was visiting. lit he Amiga family (especially the 2000) does
well. then we Amiga users can also look lOrward to more
software from the Utah based WordPerfect programmers.
Current products include a spreadsheet and database.
WordPerfect Amiga takes its place beside Atari ST,
Apple Macintosh and IBM versions in the PC ﬁeld. The
Amiga 2000 can. in particular. take advantage of the text
File compatibility between different computer types. At the
recent Commodore show, Sentinel had both Amiga and
IBM versions running side by side in the 2000, one in the
Amiga, one in the MSDOS task window. When you buy
WordPerfect on the Amiga, you buy a product which is
available on almost everything, including DEC VAX and
PC networks.
Working with WordPerfect
WordPerfect has got every 'standard' feature you would
expect of a wordprocessor. Each feature is accessed via pull-
down menus and submenus a l l  with alternative (function)
key presses - with all choices offered on screen. For instance,
on selecting a search and replace on formatting codes. all the
codes are listed on screen for you to choose. You are not
expected to remember them or look them up. Substantial
help texts can also be called up to explain any operation.
No requirement therefore t o  start with the manual
whereas the more advanced features can be learned by using
the tutorial disk and the manual together. WordPerfect,
unlike some packages. is  fully  in tune with the Amiga
environment. Just click on the disk icon, then the WP icon
and you are into the full-screen text window, which can be

periodically makes a backup of your ﬁle in case of accident
but documents also have to be saved at the end of a session.
Editing Text
Before describing some of WordPerfect's editing abilities, it
is necessary to explain that each document has two elements.
For each text that is visible on screen, there is a second text
'below' with formatting codes included. This second text can
be displayed in the bottom part of a split window and can be
edited in the same way as the lop layer'. The codes look like
this:
(Margin, Set:0,74)
(C)
(HRt)
(Tab Set:LI5)
(TAB)
and affect the text after them until the next equivalent
command takes precedence. As required, the user can get to
know them and take precise control of the text at low level.
For the great majority of the time these codes will be inserted
invisibly as you edit a document, choosing linespacing,

centring, justiﬁcation, hyphenation and so on. All style and
formatting features can be generated with the mouse or from
the keyboard. Differing line lengths, simply adjusted on the
ruler. tabulation and bold and italic styles are shown on
screen
Modiﬁcations to the text can be made by character,
word, paragraph or marked block. Rectangular blocks can
be copied, deleted or moved cut and paste style. As well as
editing text over a single line length. you can type into
columns across the page. The columns can be protected or
'newspaper style', where the text ﬂows from the current
column into the next column to the right of it.
Advanced Facilities
WordPerfect is plainly for the Amiga user who processes

available. Once activated, each paragraph is aisigned a new
number. Each new tab position gives a new level (and style)
of numbering. There is a large range of styles to choose from.
for instance IV, I, A, a.
Each page of WordPerfect document can have its footers
and headers and a footnote generated as you write will
automatically appear ( with correct formatting) a t  the
bottom of the page. A table of contents and an index, both
with headings and subheadings and a variety of presentation
styles, can be automatically generated by  marking the
required words.
For anyone who wants to incorporate straightforward
maths into a  document a  type o f  mini spreadsheet is

descriptive text are entered into up to 26 tabulated columns.
Subtotals and totals  ar e displayed and any  changes

The mail merge facility is always a vital part o f  any

a standard document with a list of alternative texts typed

Sophistication
For me the sophistication of WordPerfect is reﬂected in this
sort of attention to detail: when you mark a block of upper
case text and turn it into lower case, WordPerfect will. by
default though not necessarily, retain upper case characters
at the start of any sentence within the block. Marvellous!
And if  you get anything wrong there are three levels of
'undo'.
There are none of the desk top or form drawing features
of some specialist wordprocessors, but WordPerfect appears
to provide sophisticated and well-directed facilities without
leaving the user behind. M y  brief acquaintance left me
impressed and pleased that t he Amiga's  potential is
beginning to be fulﬁlled by ambitious software, the power of
which I have only been able to hint at in this article.

Another batch of games for the Amiga,
old favourites and hot new properties
jostle for places inside Your Amiga.
o you remember Pac Man? That seemingly easy game
where you controlled the movements o f a yellow, ball-
shaped mouth that ate and ate and ate...?
After Asteroids, Pac Man was probably one of the ﬁrst
arcade games to make it big Stateside; it is probably the only
arcade with a children's cartoon series to its name (thank
God), and after setting off a whole genre of chase-orientated
spin-offs, Pac Man sank into obscurity, occasionally
popping up here and there in seedy motorway cafes.
Well, this time Pac Man has surfaced on the Amiga;
called Cruncher Factory, this is not only Pac Man with all
the bells and whistles, but it is the ﬁrst Pac Man I have ever
seen with the option to have two players playing at the same
time!
The cruncher moves about the screen, eating the little
dots and the larger green dots, which work as power pills,
enabling you to eat the monsters for a short period of time.
Sometimes a fruit appears and can be eaten for bonus points
(unless the monsters get it ﬁrst).
However, Cruncher Factory has a great deal more than
its name might suggest. Because the Amiga has bags of
memory, A nco have added features such as Random walls
appearing in the middle of the game (often hemming you in
at the last minute), 30 different and increasingly wicked
mazes, and the option to design another 70 of your own!
These days, maze designers are becoming increasingly
popular in games of this genre, and in the case of Cruncher
Factory, it stops it becoming just another version of Pac
Now you can create mazes made up of your own name,

It's not that Cruncher Factory isn't an enjoyable game,
it's just that without these little extras, Cruncher Factory
would be just another Pac Man rip off, good for perhaps a
few games. thankfully, Cruncher Factory i s insanely
addictive and I can't stop booting the disk up whenever I
have a free moment to spare.
If you are looking for Pac Man on the Amiga, then this is
a reasonable game: it doesn't make the most of the Amiga's
graphics capabilities, but none the less, it is enjoyable.

his game iN a karate 'simulation' where the Amiga is
used to  create some stunningly beautiful backgrounds.
Against which, you create utter ma) hem while you battle ita

out either against the computer as the Red Fighter, or
'between friends', with an opponent.
The mouse is not used with this package, and a joystick is
required for  all sixteen moves. The Amiga handles the
graphics with such ease tht the red ﬁghter seems to almost
sweat as he lunges at you with some pretty nasty kicks.
The sound effects are very good, with sampled shouts
and cracks, and a few good groans as well. The problem is
that I  don't really k now what I  am ﬁghting for! The
immediate aim is fairly simple though — to knock the red
ﬁghter unconscious so that you can move onto the next
screen.
After each bout there is a short interlude as some unseen
opponent throws boulders at you from the sides, which have
to be demolished before you can move onto the next screen,
and exactly the right move is required to shatter these into
pieces.
This is a  good combat game, with some very clean
graphics and some nice music to boot (pun intended). All
nine screens are beautifully presented and although the game
is very difﬁcult in the ﬁrst three or four screens, it does not
get as difﬁcult as would be expected after level six has been
reached,
The joystick in pout two Lontrots we wnite tignter. inc
red ﬁghter has the advantage of being more powerful than
the white ﬁghter. and at higher levels he also has various
killing devices at his disposal, including shuriken, throwing
darts and so on...
As you progress, it seems that some types of punches are
more effective than others. For instance in the ﬁrst level, you
can use just about any blow you wish, but in the second level
a kneeling punch or a low kick seems to work wonders!
If you are defeated by the red ﬁghter, a couple of birds ﬂy
over you and your opponent (probably still comatose on the
ﬂoor) with a banner proudly proclaiming his superiority.
They ﬂy  o f f  and it's  time f o r  more mutilation and
mayhem... all good clean stuff.
Karate King is the best version of this sort of game I have
seen running on any machine and the ease with which the
Amiga presents each movement forces envious looks from
all the non-Amiga users I have played this game with. This
would make an ideal ﬁrst time purchase for any new Amiga
owner wanting some hack and slay software to while away a
cold evening.

major league ballpark just before most of' the fans have
arrived. The sun is shining and the hot dogs have been
cooking all summer; you ﬁnd yourself a seat with a good
vantage point (let's say just behind the batter) and you sit
down ready for the day to begin.
Accolade Software have really gone to town on the
packaging for this one. Hardball is a game that has not only
captured the essence of a major league baseball game, but
believe, will successfully make the transition from America
to Britain with consummate ease.
Hardball — in America — is a game that is played on a
pitch like rounders, using the scoring of cricket, and has the
popularity of football; add to this the tactical strategy of a
small (and paranoid) South American country with a large
nuclear arsenal, and I think you'll get the gist of this slice of
American pie.
So, kitted out with baseball hat, a six pack (of cherry
Coke) and my Amiga. I booted up the game and prepared
myself for a whole new experience.
First of all. you are given the option to use either a mo
or a joystick. You can play Hardball against the comput
against friends or even set the Amiga to play against itse
From here on, you are going to have to know a num
of things. Firstly, you are going to have to know how to p
baseball. This isn't too difﬁcult, as the game is essentially
same as rounders (i.e. hit a ball and run like hell!) but unl
rounders, there us an umpire behind the batsman w
decides whether or not the ball is in the 'strike area' (for m
information, just see the hilarious 'Bad news Bears' ﬁ
which is, incidentally, all about a bunch o f  losers in
league, and you'll soon pick up on how things work in
game).

team you are currently waging war against. The tips in the
back of the handbook are reasonably useful - should you
happen to know baseball jargon - but the best way to get to
know an opponent is to see how he reacts to a pitcher's
throws, and this is where pen and paper come in useful.
Play begins with the pitcher's screen, depicting the
pitcher, the batter, and the well-protected umpire. You arc
looking from the centre ﬁeld and are able to control either
the 'Champs' team or the 'All Stars'. If you are the team
batting, you simply decide which is the best type of strike to
attempt (don't forget you don't have to try to hit a ball - if
you don't think you can hit it, the umpire usually agrees with
you!).
You give the ball a great big whack and you run around
the pitch, passing as many of the bases as you can. If you get
there before the ball, then all is well; if You don't, then you
are out, and the crowd squeal in delight - nice to know where
your friends are!
Pitching is even better! You select which is the best (Or
rather worst) throw for your opponent (i.e. can you get the
ball past him three times, with the umpire calling 'strike'
each time?). If the batter hits the ball, the screen clears to
display the ﬁeld, and the ball slowly arcing over to one of
your ﬁelders. You, with mouse in hand, then take on the role
of ﬁelder and move the closest player to meet and catch the
ball, and then throw it on to the next base on from the
runners -  like rounders, you are to try to get the ball there
before the runner, and so catch him out.
The attention to detail is amazing! In the corner of the
screen is a Bazooka Joe. propped up against a wall eternally
blowing gum. The crowd murmurs excitedly between
pitches, and cheers wildly whenever anything gets hit. The
sound as the bat strikes the ball is very realistic a  wonderful
'crack' that could have inspired Sir John Betjeman's 'sound
of leather on willow' quote.
The animation is very smooth, especially when pitching
the ball, or when you are batting; and when the scene
changes to the ﬁeld, you can run about with the selected
ﬁelder ﬂashing on and off until he throws the ball. As a
batter races against an approaching ball, they slide into base
in a cloud of dust and gravel.., great stuff!
Substitutions a re  easily made,
should vou ﬁnd a man beginning to wear under the strain of
being active in the ﬁeld for too long, and should you work
out the playing tactics of a pitcher or batter, then you can
improve your chances of beating him by selecting a more
iiitable opponent, so there's quite a bit of thinking to be
done as well as playing.
Hardball is an amazing game; it is delightfully free of
violence, and it has captured not only the competitive spirit
of the game, but also, I  believe, the atmosphere of the
ballpark, the excitement of the crowd and the smell of those
lovely sizzling hot dogs!

Challenger
A
packages for the Amiga. The aim of the game is to collide as
little as possible with the objects at the upper (grey) level and
the lower (green) level on the screen. Player one uses a
joystick, plugged into port two, which is used to control the
speed at which the green background scrolls past and
determining the rate at which the blue ship moves forward.
The computer, (or player two) controls the rate at which the
grey background scrolls past, as well as the ﬂight of the green
ship, if played in 'two player' mode.
The players pilot their space ships and try to avoid
colliding with either the landscape or the grey level, as each
impact causes an energy drain. If the way ahead is clear, you
simply accelerate, hopefully causing your opponent to
collide and explode, the upper level is ﬁlled with a
latticework o f  anonymous, nondescript grey buildings,
occasionally labelled 'land here' (you can't), the lower with
trees, shrubs and more small buildings. After the third.
'underwater' level, the game improves a little -  but not
much, and certainly not enough to  distract you from
wondering how the spaceships got underwater in the ﬁrst
place.
Challenger is essentially a 'dodge out of the way' game
with eight different levels. The problem is that there is very
little substance to the game. as all that you are doing is
dodging out of the way whenever an obstacle in the lower or
upper levek approaches. A basic explanation or scenario of
the type often found in accompanying novellas might have
relieved this, as at least there might be an underlying goal. As
it stands, twelve lines of instructions are clearly not enough.
Instead. the game revolves around the one (or two)
spaceships, which are controlled by joysticks; note that
neither the mouse nor the keyboard are used here, which is
unusual, and annoying, in that not all users will have
joysticks for their Amiga, and this will seriously limit the
game's appeal.
Playing the game is a rather unenjoyable and boring
affair as you are simply avoiding the trees and bushes and the
various ground based buildings. while keeping an eye out for

the upper 'grey' level buildings that seem to sweep past you.
and anyway how can buildings travel faster than the ground
they are supposedly supported by?
One interesting aspect of Challenger is the method of
scoring. For instance. I was starting a new game when I
suddenly abandoned the joystick, allowing the ship to carry
on unaided fo r a  short while, until i t ploughed into
something that can be best described as a runway with 'land
here' proudly emblazoned on it (I told you, you couldn't)!
The high score table told me that this was worth 64,334
points, whereas a  controlled ﬂight lasting a good few
minutes was worth only a few hundred points!
Now either I'm going crazy, or there is something
seriously wrong with a scoring system that takes absolutely
no account of ﬂying, dodging or tactical skills whatsoever!
Playing against the computer is even less enjoyable, as
nothing new happens. The sound effects are virtually
nonexistant. while the ships themselves are unimpressive.
They consist of one dimensional objects that do not ﬁt in
with the otherwise well-designed graphics. nor do they look
anything like the ship in the loading screen. Even the
explosions are unsatisfying!
The loading screen provides something of an anticlimax
in that the long list of credits seems to promise more from the
game than it actually delivers. I am well aware that this is a
low price game. but the waste of the Amiga's facilities is
reprehensible. although Anco have proved, with games such
as Karate King. that they can provide excellent software for
this machine, that utilises its capabilities to the full. Software
of this ilk usually tends to be restricted to free distribution
among user groups and public domain libraries.
All in all, I would give Challenger a miss, unless, of
course, you have money to burn.

W
but CDS Software have converted a popular program across
to the Amiga which offers a little bit of English culture for
this primarily American machine.
Brian Clough's Football Fortunes has the unusual
approach of being probably the world's ﬁrst computer game
that plays side by side with a board game. It is suitable for
two to ﬁve players and each player takes on the role of a
Football club manager.
The object of the game is for each player to successfully
steer his team through the season, using his skill to make the
team stronger as the games proceed. Each manager
competes against both human and computer controlled
teams i n  a  ten-strong ﬁrst division fo r  the league
championship and, of course, the FA Cup. From the second
YOUR AMIGA november 1987
12
season onwards, each team will compete towards the
European competition, through the usual practice of league
champions going through to the European Cup, the FA Cup
winners going through to the European Cup Winners Cup,
and the remaining clubs going on to the UEFA Cup.
The winner of Brian Clough's Football Fortunes is the
manager who survives to the end of the game and has the
highest number of game points. Game points are those
awarded by the computer and are based on each manager's
performance in the league cup competitions, and on the
amount of raw cash he has managed to accrue and, more
importantly, retain, by the end of the game.
Sounds familiar? You bet it is! Brian Clough's Football
Fortunes is simply a well presented and very enjoyable
variant of the old board game of Monopoly. The main aim of
the manager is to create as strong a team as possible, by
increasing the star rating of his side. However while doing,
this, he must not neglect any section of the team or he will
lose matches, nor must he overspend as the scales of fate
sometimes tip unfavourably — often at a time when you could
really do without the extra hassle.
Ah well, such is the stuff of which football managers are
made, and if you can look after your bank balance while
retaining your star players, then you could go far.
Footballers are purchased from other football managers
and a player can also obtain star material from Auctions.
this must be done shrewdly and with skill yes we would all
like a world cup goal scorer in our teams, but unless you can
survive buying him, and you gain the results you expect
quickly. then you may just as well have thrown your money
down the drain, as a foolish purchase can cost you your job -
and nobody knows more about getting the boot than Brian
Clough!
The game is mor o r less managed by the computer, but
don't think this is a quick 30 minute-to-play job, as playing
Brian dough's Football Fortunes can take anything from a
couple of hours to a whole afternoon, depending on how
many people are playing.
The computer doesn't do all the work for you it provides
lists of forthcoming ﬁxtures, the current league table, details
of points scored by both clubs and managers throughout the
game and the chance cards allotted to players, as well as the
all important printout of results on the screen at the end of
each league game. This is in the same way that the results are
presented at ﬁve o'clock every Saturday afternoon during
Meager : Clive Greee
Club : Liveretal

the football season, but you do need to look after the way
cash is spent, as well as making sure that the pitch does not
fall into disrepair and that occasional refurbishments are
made as required.
After each match, the manager can receive his gate
money from the banker. He will be given half of the amount
shown by the monitor, and the size of the gate receipts
depends, of course, on the league positions of the teams
playing any given ﬁxture. For example, playing a top ﬂight
team could be a big pay-off for all concerned, i f the two
teams were well matched. However, if you are scraping
around th e  bottom o f  the league, then I  wouldn't
recommend brealling the bank trying for the summer tour of
South America!
This is an excellent strategy game - probably one of the
best o f its genre as it requires methodical thinking and
almost brutal planning ahead, but then that's life at the top!
Brian Clough's Football Fortunes is also an unusual
game in the way that it brings the players together more than
if it were, say, a completely computer orientated game. The
graphics are nothing special, being mainly rather chunky -
but colourful -  menus, but then managing a football team
gives you more to think of than mere frivolities.
Full marks must go CDS software for their packaging of
Brian Clough's Football Fortunes; the 'funny money', the
cards, the board and the instructions all come together to
make a n  excellent package -  perhaps n o t family
entertainment, but a great way to amuse your friends for an
evening. Oh. and if you should have any problems regarding
the game, there is  a  special Br ian Clough's Football
Fortunes hotline set up by CDS s o f
call dedication!

Balance of Power

computer opponent. then Balance of Power, Mirrorsoft's
Mindscape strategy game of geopolitics, will not disappoint.
The game puts you in the shoes of the American President or
the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. Your
judgement and temperament will determine the outcome of
an eight-year long cold war. The object is to win prestige and
inﬂuence i n the global sphere, without instigating a
holocaust -  the ultimate failure in B o f P. A  score is
maintained and can be viewed at any time.
Each year you support insurgents against the enemy as
well as political allies under threat, with both economic and
military aid. These hotspots are where each oppoonent can
throw down the diplomatic gauntlet and may begin a crisis.
You must decide when to back down as well as when to stand
ﬁrm.

Ray Tracing
Following the popularity o f  Eric
Graham's Juggler animation, ra y
tracing c ould become t his  year's
computer f a d !  Er ic 's  r a y  tr ac er
software i s  available f r om Amiga
Centre Scotland, but beware because it
isn't an animation package, it  only
generates a single frame at a time. Eric
is working on an animator for his ray
tracer generated images but in  the
meantime just putting together your
own picture is a fascinating exercise.
To create a picture. the positions,
size and colours o f  the spheres and
lamps ( light sources) hav e t o  b e
deﬁned in a data ﬁle. The program ssg
processes t h e  input ﬁle. puts  the
resulting image on screen and sends it
to a speciﬁed output ﬁle. The ﬁnished
ﬁles can be more rapidly displayed by
the ss program. This is just as well
because the original takes an age. In
fact one of the useful options you can
set from the command line when you
call ssq is the picture size. A small, and
more quickly generated, version can be
used to check your input data. Other
options available include a vertical
Format pic tur e a n d  anti-alias ing
(blurring at the edges).
The input ﬁle contains the position
of the observer, the direction that the
observer is looking, the focal length of
the observer's camera lens, the objects
- a series of spheres, tubes and chains -
the number of lamps, the speciﬁcation
of each lamp, the colour of the ground,
the diffuse illumination and the sky.
The software is supplied with full
documentation, some ﬁnished and an
example ray tracer ﬁle ready to be
worked on.

Amiga Promise
p
spellchecker for the major Amiga wordprocessors, boasting
a 95,000 w or d dictionary, a  spelling helper a n d  a
punctuation checker. How do these features match up to the
task of keeping yOur copy clean?
Because spell checking is a necessary evil rather than an
entertainment. I am happy to say that Promise does not mess
around. A simple ﬁle display with click/requester boxes for
drives and directories is used to select the ﬁle for checking. In
a similar fashion 'custom' dictionaries (those you have
created yourself) can be loaded into RAM, where they merge
and are used in tandem with the main dictionary to check the
selected text ﬁle.
When activated, Promise rapidly detects any words
unknown to it (not necessarily incorrect)and prompts you to
either correct the spelling or go on checking. You can specify
whether any change or ignore should apply 'just this once"
or for 'all occurrences'.
Any word which is unknown to Promise can alsp. be
added to the custom dictionary which can then be saved in its
amended form for later use. When correcting you can make
use of the 'help with spelling' feature, You just click on one
of a number of suggested words which are listed in Promise
and your selection is exported as the correction.
The 'Spelling Helper'
A •close relation to the above is the separate 'spelling helper'
which can be opened as a task on its own and used while
writing (or doing a word puzzle, crossword, de). You can
look up spellings and words using wildcards in place of the
letters you are unsure of, e.g. p r "
words beginning with pr; recrve will ﬁnd the correct spelling
receive: * is substituted for any part of a word, e.g. p*c*t*ry
which is unknown. Great for Scrabble cheats!
The punc tuation c hec k er w or k s  alongs ide t h e
spellchecker when activated and ﬁnds punctuation which
does not correspond t o  its basic rules. A  correction is
suggested which can be accepted or refused as with spelling.
Promise checks for double punctuation marks (usually a
typing mistake), lack of a space after'a punctuation mark.
commas and full stops outside quote marks and colons and
semicolons inside quotes.

no advanced reference manuals readily available to the ﬁrst
time user, and the massive four volumes of the 'Technical
Reference G uide' published b y  Addis on Wes ley  i s
considered heavy weight reading matter and is really only
suitable for the machine code programmer who is already
adept at programming in the Amiga's native tongue.
The 'Kickstart Guide to the Amiga' is , bv  contrast, a
smaller tome. Published by Ariadne Software, this large
format paperback book has 250 pages and contains so much
information, I had to put the book down every ten minutes
to stop myself getting overwhelmed by the sheer mass of
information.
The Kickstart Guide is written from the point of view of
the serious software programmer who has, for the ﬁrst time,
delved into the world of 16 bit computers only to be confused
by the extra memory and facilities that the Amiga has over
other machines in its caste.
The book is roughly divided into three sections; part one
is an introduction to the Amiga. and I couldn't wish for a
more comprehensive introduction to the general hardware.
It satisﬁes the craving for more information after devouring
the BASIC reference manual and the Amiga 'Welcome'
manual for the ﬁrst time.
The opening chapter serves t o  explain the 68000
processor, its interrupt handling facilities and its rather over-
indulgent register handling system. T h e  introduction
explains how the 68000 ﬁts into the Amiga's working
environment and where necessary, it pulls comparisons from
the more familiar world of  the 6502 processor, so users
upgrading from their C64's or Cl28's will ﬁnd it easier to
understand the complex interrupt facilities the 68000 has to
offer.
The second section is divided into ﬁve smaller sections,
and attempts to explain I/O  stream. how to access various
devices and setting up a few virtual ones of your own. This
chapter goes o n t o  setting up multitasking operations
ﬁnishing off with an intriguing chapter called 'Serial port
debugging, and the Joy of Whack' -  sounds like fun!
Have you ever wondered what those numbers are at the
end of the 'Guru Meditation' message? The Kickstart Guide
not only tells you how to translate them, but also explains
when an error is an operating system crash, a hardware fault
or an applications bug, and there are w a s  of retrieving
information after the Guru has meditated. Ommmm mmm.
The Amiga's  famous  graphic s  c apabilities  a r e

Book Review
There's no need to be bogged down with heavy reading when you're learning about

answer.

even further by discussing how the graphics can be more
freely accessed through the Amiga's 'copper' co-processor
hardware, and introduces us to the special custom chips
named 'Paula', 'Angus' and 'Denise'. These chips can be
used t o obtain beautifully ﬂuid computer animation by
synchronising the blitter and bimmer chips to the screen
'ﬂyback state'.
The third section is an introduction to 'C'. and promptly
pushes you off at the deep end into programming with
arrays, strings, data pointers and all of the most useful things
you will need when programming in a new language for the
ﬁrst time.
While this section does not purport to be a deﬁnitive
description o f  'C'. I  would, however, recommend this
section to programmers wishing to sample the delights of
this powerful programming language for the ﬁrst time. It
does jump ahead of itself at times, but with a little note
taking, many o f  the initial questions regarding 'C' are
answered. Interestingly enough, the style o f  the manual
becomes les s  c hatty , under ly ing A  riadne's serious
commitment to the 'C' language.
There are quite a few examples in 'C' short enough to go
through without resorting to buying a 'C' compiler, but as
many of the serious programmes and games are written in
'C', it seems sensible to think of 'moving up' to 'C' at some
point or another.
In all, 'The Kickstart Guide to the Amiga' is competently
written in a friendly style without too much rambling on
about how 'amazingly wonderful the Amiga can be, if only
you could program the damn thing.'
The most important thing about this book is that it is
written in a style that is very alluring, moreover, it inspires
conﬁdence in the programmer and while this initially leads
to a few monumental mistakes, it also puts you on the road
to experimenting with the Amiga, which is a good deal more
interesting than just pushing the mouse around your desk...
although that can be fun as well.
This is an excellent book and necessary reading if you
have an Amiga; be it a 1000 on A500 or even the A2000. If
you are thinking of getting an Amiga then this book may just
tip the balance, I can't imagine what my Sunday afternoons
were like before this book!

ﬂicker on my 1080 monitor. ProWrite's default background
colour is paper white and a dimmer (SHIFT/HELP) is
provided with cuts down ﬂicker a little. Also recommended

Nett' Horizons have come up with a
wordprocessor with a difference -
Pro Write offers colour, high resolution
and graphics in text.

is the product Jitter-Rid, a screen which ﬁts over the monitor
but I didn't get the chance to test this out. The best and most
expensive answer is the Commodore 2080 long persistence
monitor. I soon renamed the medium resolution version of
ProWrite as my default ProWrite to boot up into.
I also decided I like colour on screen. There are seven to
choose from, corresponding to the seven ribbon colours
available on a colour dot-matrix printer. The standard fonts
and three others, Granite. Marble and Serpentine (12 point
on 15 point only) can take any of  the colours, different
colours for alternate characters if you really want!
In combination w it h  a  c olour printer and colour

wordprocessor for the editor/designer of promotional print.
children's worksheets (colour is a very effective tool in
education), overhead transparencies (depending on the
printer again), indeed any presentational material in which
text is a vital element.

bold, subscripts and so on. Colour is nice but it's expensive
to deliver on paper.
No Doubt about Graphics
Without qualiﬁcation I  welcome Pr oWrite's ability  t o
combine graphics and text. ProWrite allows you to cut out a
rectangular block o f  IF T  graphics, created in  a  'paint'
program, This is achieved by opening a second document
and loading the graphics. At this stage you are prompted to
choose the degree of shading to apply to the graphics. full.
partial or none. The choice depends on the picture and the
printer. Once *cut', the graphic appears in the top lefhand
corner of the text document in which you 'paste'. You can
then move the graphic around the document to wherever it
looks best, Text can take on the background colour of the
graphic which creates a  x•'ery impressive feature when
printed.
Unlike a program such as GEM write. ProWrite lets the
:ext ﬂow around the graphics box, it doesn't have to stop
above and below. You can even type into the spaces in the
picture.
I have begun to experiment with clip art: dinosaurs in the
I
background of a draft letter to the bank manager; fun things
Iike teddy bears I  suppose it should have been he-men or
.zobots o n  children's stationery. Graphics can also be used
to impress. A  3D  graph from Aegis Impacd can nicely
explain (away) some ﬁgures. Even the ﬁgures themselves

call be used as a table. Company logos, letterheads and
standard artwork can also be created and used over and
over. ProWrite allows  them t o  be incorporated in t o
displayed footers or headers.
U T I L I T Y  R E V I E W
Standards
YOUR AMIGA november 1987

ProWrite lets you have a number of documents open at the
same time, each in its own window which can be sized or
placed in the background or scrolled. Text can be moved or
copied between windows. Each layout is controlled by the
margins, indents and tabs set on the ruler at the top of the
document. Settings apply to individual paragraph blocks
(deﬁned as text between presses of' the RETURN key). The
markers for these blocks can be made visible for editing
purposes and a format can be copied between paragraphs
blocks.
As you type, ProNAfrite wraps the text according to the
selected format, e.g. justiﬁed, centred, double-spaced. etc.
ProW rite indicates page breaks as they occur. Footers and
headers are entered via a menu option with a number of page
numbering styles to choose from. They can be displayed on
screen if required and there's an option to turn the header
(and rooter) off for the title page.
The pull-down menus give a good idea o f  the more
standard features o f  ProWrite. The search and replace
operation is particularly friendly through the use of on/off
buttons and check boxes with which you can set the exact
search pattern you require. The keyboard shortcuts, the
keyboard equivalents of pull-down menu options. some of
which are on function keys, are also vital for the regular user.
Summary
I very much enjoyed using ProWrite. Although it does lack a
spellchecker and supports onlv Preferences printers, and
you can't print marked sections o f  a document, only a
minimum one page. The t100 plus price tag makes it an
unlikely buy for the beginner, which is a shame because
ProP4Prite is very easy to use. ProWrite can achieve the more
ambitious print projects you may have in mind, which its
rivals cannot. In respect of graphics and colour ProWrite is
out on its own, but is it also ahead of  its time or your
hardware budget?

he Amiga is. as everybody knows,
a stunning graphics computer: it has
enough memory set aside for all but
the most demanding of applications
and to make life even easier, there are a
number o f  screen 'modes offer ing
various res olutions  a n d  c olour s
suitable for various applications.
The Amiga can display a maximum
of 32 colours, which can be logical
colours, or  shades o f  any particular
colour, i.e. black and white 'grey scale'
colours.
One o f  the least understood and
most underestimated o f  the screen
modes available on the Amiga is the
hold and modify' video display mode.
Initially it was considered something
of a curiosity, enabling colour palettes
to be shared on the screen at the same
time. To the best of my knowledge, no
package has yet used this facility to the
full.
With the H AM mode, the Amiga
can display all of the 4096 colours at
the same time, which is no mean feat.
And when y ou consider the many
hours t h a t  hav e g o n e  i n t o  t h e
programming of this new screen mode,
it is  amazing that the software was
ﬁnished at all!
introducing Digi Paint
Digi Paint is a new software package
which is quite frankly, comparable to
professional graphics workstations
which cost many thousands of pounds.
Digi Paint is capable of working in,
and displaying, %•ry high resolution
pictures using this HAM mode, in both
the 320 x  200 and the 320 x  400
resolution modes.
S O F T W A R E  R E V I E W
Digi Paint reads standard !FF
so if you have drawn a picture using
any art package, for example Deluxe
Paint, o r  i f  y ou have a  digitised
photograph, y ou can quite happily
load screens in and modify them using
Digi Paint. Indeed, New Tek regard
Digi Paint as a companion software
package t o  their  D ig i View  video
digitiser.
The HAM mode uses six-bit planes
to display images, which means that
each Pixel uses six bits to determine its
colour. I f  the ﬁrst two bits are "00"
then the remaining four bits are used to
determine t he pixel's colour, thus
giving a choice of a possible sixteen
colours f r o m  t h e  t o t a l o f  4096
available.
If the ﬁrst two bits of a pixel are
YOUR AMIGA november 1987
25
Stretch the graphics capability of your Amiga to the ﬁtll
with this up-market arts package.
"01", then the pixel has the same
colour as the pixel to the left; if the bits
are " 1 0 "  then t he las t f o u r  bits
(remember they are the ones that
determine the pixers colour) replace
the green value, and if the ﬁrst two bits
are "I I", then the lost four bits replace
the blue value.
The effect of all this is that you can
display all 4096 colours on the screen
at once. although you cannot change
from black (red, green and blue all set
to "0") to white ( red. green and blue all
set t o  " 1 " )  immediately. However,
such a  s mall limitation i s  hardly
noticeable when using any HAM mode
screen.
Natﬂirally. such efﬁcient house-
keeping takes a lot of programming.
and for  the Amiga 500, Digi Paint

requires jus t about ever
memory it has to offer, so if you still
have a 256K Amiga 1000, now may be
the time to think about getting that
memory upgrade y o u  hav e been
considering.
Using Digi Paint
The D igi Paint package contains a
single disk and a manual and to use it.
you simply boot up the disk from the
workbench prompt and you are then
greeted with the Digi2()0 and Digi400
icons. You can examine the drawers
holding Digi Paint artwork by opening
them up. Once opened a miniature of
each of the screens is displayed as an
icon, This is very useful, especially as
you can enter the package by double
clicking the icon you wish to edit.
Both the 200 and the 400 resolution
programmes have the same screen and
menu displays, although t h e  400
resolution is 'non-interlaced'. Really,
you need a slow refresh monitor to
stop the screen ﬂickering, however the
standard 1081 monitors fare very well
while using this mode.
The whole of the screen is used for
your artwork, leaving a static window
at t h e  bottom, crammed f u l l  o f
options, including brushes of various
shapes and sizes, a pair of scissors for
cutting o u t  areas  f o r  'brus hing'
elsewhere on the screen, or for other
ﬁles, a magnifying glass for really close
up work, and a %Try comprehensive
ﬁll option.
Other facilities include being able
S O FTW A R E  R E V I E W
to pick a colour from the picture you
are drawing on. F or  example, ﬂesh
tones are some of the most complex
colours a painter can achieve, but if
you ar e us ing a  digitised c olour
photograph, these tones are instantly
accessible by simply clicking the 'pick
colour' icon and moving the arrow to
the desired position on the screen.
The ability to take a colour from
one picture and move it to another is a
very useful feature. Have you ever
taken a black and white photograph
and later wished i t  were in colour?
Well, with Digi Paint you can simply
take t h e  digitised image o f  t h e
photograph. transfer the colours from
another photograph (or even from the
colour board on the static screen) and
then paint away by  using the tint
option. The end result can be very.
effective, especially with old fashioned
photographs such as the presidents of
America supplied with the 'Butcher'
graphics utility disks.
Should you have drawn something
that didn't work out as planned. you
can 'undo' that portion of the drawing
a little like stepping back in time to a
paint before you committed something
to the screen. You can also repeat
options by pressing the 'again' icon,
enabling y o u  t o  quic k ly  repeat
operations t h a t  r equir e c omplex
actions.
Brushing Up The Act
W A
Dithering is a process used by many 8
bit art packages to obtain shades of
YOUR AMIGA november 1987
26
colour. F o r  example, b y  hav ing
alternate pixels of red and yellow, a
computer can generate an orange of
sorts. With the Amiga, even subtler
shades of colour can be created using
dithers, so that a possible 65000 shades
of colour can be obtained, comparable
to the total colour capability o f  a
Quantel graphics workstation.
The colouring of black and white
pictures has become quite a heated
issue in the world of cinematographers.
some of whom take offence at the false
colouring of old ﬁlms in order to give
them new life and lustre. For black and
white photographs however, D i g i
Paint has some very real applications.
For instance, once can experiment
with combinations o f  face make up
(assuming you have the right colours
to begin with!) or sketch out ideas for
interior decoration and clothes design.
For the sheer fun of painting, the
computer can be a very expressive tool,
but a f t e r  being s o  us ed t o  t h e
limitations of  8 colours on other art
packages f o r  other  machines, t h e
choice o f  colours can be somewhat
overwhelming. T h e  mous e i s  a n
excellent t o o l  f o r  dr awing w it h ,
although I have yet to use a graph pad
in conjunction w it h  t his  piece o f
software.
Custom shapes can be manipulated
for added depth and realism. A circle
can be drawn with both the o p t i o n
and the 'shading' option sets and this
will draw a wonderfuly hazy circle with
concentric c ir c le patterns r unning
around it. By altering the 'dither' slider
to make the effects of the dithering less
localised. the concentric circles change
into fuzzy balls. not dissimilar t o
Voyager photographs o f  some o f
Saturn's moons.
• Of all the menus on the screen, the
Mode menu is the most useful, Digi
Paint modes can be thought o f  as
different paint types. Choosing the
correct mode for a particular part of a
drawing can be an art form in itself,
and they are especially useful if you are
merging pictures together.
More importantly  perhaps, t he
mode effects are used to create the
many subtle and varied effects possible
while using Digi Paint.
The options include drawing when
using solid paint, blending, tinting,
light tinting, minimum and maximum
pasting. as well as the usual Add. Or
and XO R (exclusive or) pasting and
painting styles available o n  other
packages.

S O F T W A R E  R E V I E W
-There are twelve brushes in all,
these range from small circles to large
diamonds and lines. There are a few
basic shapes as well, including either
solid o r  outlined circle and ellipses
shapes, rectangles and squares, not to
mention the spray can!
For really ﬁne detail drawing, or
particularly exacting blending work.
the magnifying glass is often useful.
This provides a close up image of any
portion of the screen and the section
you are magnifying is displayed (in real
size) in the top right hand corner. You
can happily  perform mos t o f  the
standard editing functions while in
zoom mode, except for  moving the
magnifying glass around.
The scissors are used to cut out
,
wholesale t o  another par t o f  the
screen. Technically, this is creating a
new brush, and the cut out portion can
be saved to a 'brushes* ﬁle. Using the
!scissors with the 'blend' option set in
the screen mode area can create some
stunning effects, such as adding extra
limbs a n d  or gans  t o  a  b o d y .
Interestingly enough, in order to create
mirror image with a brush created by
using the scissors, you have to ﬁrst cut
out or  load y our 'brush' and then
reverse the whole screen! Once pasted
town. you can, of course, reverse the
,ereen again, but it strikes me as being
a little drastic!
Digital Drawings
Digi Paint is an amazingly intuitive art
package t h e  mous e b e in g  v er y
responsive and an excellent artist tool.
The interesting t h in g  about t h is
package (other than t h e  stunning
range of colours of course) is the way
that pictures can be drawn so quickly.
My ﬁrst attempt with the package
yielded a complete artists rendition of
a strand o f  D N A ,  complete w ith
Purine to Pyrimidine cross links!
There are a great many facilities
that are suitable for advanced work,
such a s  templating a n d  creating
quarter-tones by dithering two shades
of colour together. The effect is so
subtle that I had to put both colours
together before I  ( or  anyone else)
YOUR AMIGA november 1987
27
could notice the difference!
The 340 x 400 resolution version of
Digi Paint takes up a lot of memory,
on a 512K Amiga and this can result in
certain func tions , s uc h a s  t h e
magnifying glass and the brushes,
being inhibited. However, y ou can
reclaim these functions by moving to
the 'preferences' window and clicking
off the workbench. Digi Paint does not
use the workbench f o r  itself, s o it
doesn't need to be active while you are
using the 340 x  400 package. N o
problems are encountered when using
I megabyte Amigas.
Digi Paint is an excellent drawing
tool, especially if you are looking for
low cost professional art package with
high quality  outputs  -  t h e  o n ly
problem is  ﬁnding a printer with a
good enough output!
All in all, Digi Paint is an excellent
art package. I t  pushes the Amiga's
already impressive graphics capability
to its limits, and it is a friendly and
powerful pac k age w i t h  amaz ing
potential, especially i f  y o u  a r e
interested i n  modify ing digitis ed
photographs (both colour and black
and white), o r  i f  you are adapting
pictures drawn by other, less powerful
packages.

So what's it all about? What kind
of Eprom projects can be attempted on
the Commodore? These fall into three
main types:

Tools Of The Trade
So what are the basic prerequisites for
this mysterious art? Access t o  an
Eprom programmer is an obvious no.
I on the list if you wish to program or
'burn' your own devices. If you intend
to buy your own programmer these are
not too expensive nowadays and you
can pick up a good one for around E40.
Look Ola for one with a monitor built
into the software and make sure that it
burns up to 32K devices since these are
now the most economical to use.
If you are to experiment with $8000

appear in various places in computer
memory. I f  you have an old game
cartridge this  c ould b e  used after
removing the old chip.
For replacing the internal Rums in
the computer or drive you will need a
conversion or  carrier board. This as
the name suggests is a simple little
device that plugs into the socket from
where the Rom has been removed (24
pins) and this  i n  t u r n  accepts a
conventional 28 pin Eprom. These
usually come with a switch-on board
to allow bank switching and again cost
less than £10. If you are handy with a
soldering ir on y ou c ould probably
knock one of these up using a couple of
IC sockets and a switch.
A small supply of 8K, 16K or 32K
Eproms ar e required. Since mos t
Commodore projects w i l l  involve
replacing one or more 8K blocks we
can use the bigger of the devices and
use bank switching (more later) to
select the banks or pages of the chip.
Eproms come in three main guises.

programmed and then erased by UV

suggests can only  be burned once.
These types are less expensive but are
not suited to development work for
obvious reasons. They tend to get used
For pr oduc tion r u n s  w her e t h e
program is not likely to need changing.
The last main type is the EEprom. This
device c an b e  erased electrically,
usually with an Eprom programmer,
and re-burned m a n y  times . T h e
EEprom is the most expensive type but
doesn't require a UV eraser.
Programming an Eprom is  really a
very simple operation. The program
designated for your chip is ﬁrst loaded
into memory. This could be from a
number of sources: disk, tape. another
Eprom o r  may be f r o m  another
internal Rom in the 64/128. A good
Eprom programmer will allow you to
make any changes to the code via its
own monitor. When you are ready to
program your device ﬁrst check the
type and program voltage. Again the
ability to support a range of devices
and voltages is standard with a decent
programmer. With a  suitable blank
Eprom in the programmer, you would
usually just press a key and the chip
would be burned. This takes less than a
minute and the contents of  the chip
can then be veriﬁed against the source
program in Ram in just the same way
as a save to disk or tape. I f  all is well
you would then either burn another
chip or quit.
P R O G R A M M I N G
Conventional $8000 O r  Basic
Cartridges
The 64/128 has the ability v ia its
internal PLA to 'see' either an external
Rom or internal Ram in an SK block
from 88000. I n  addition it  will see
either internal or external Rom in the
BASIC area 8K block from $A000.
What t h e  P L A  does  i s  s imply
controlled b y  t w o  lines  o n  t h e

EXRO M w h e n  g r o u n d e d  w i l l
conﬁgure the computer in either of the
above ways. So i f  you had a M / C
program that ran at 88000 or A000
then you could burn it into a chip and
plug it into a simple cartridge board.
By setting the DIP switch or links to
ground either or both of the EXROM
and G AME lines you have yourself a
cartridge based program.
Auto Start Cartridges
The above cartridge would be started
by calling it into action. This would
involve typing SYS (start address).
This would probably be OK but the
Commodore h a s  t h e  a b ilit y  t o
autostart a cartridge. On power up,
one of the ﬁrst things that the CPU
does is look at the ﬁrst few bytes at
$8000 to see if the letters CBNI80 are
present. I f  these bytes are found then
the CPU will jump to and execute your
cartridge code.
A ty pic al autostart r outine i s

'Housekeeping' routine that does all
the things that the computer would
have done had it not found the CBM80
bytes. I n  fact the routine is  taken
almost directly from the Kernal and
Basic system Rums. So now on power
up your cartridge would 'Boot in' and,
after initialising the system. jump to
your program at 88025.
As you can see, if your program is
designed to run in the cartridge area
then i t  i s  Very straight forward.
However many programmes including

directly in this way, though you can
still get them on to a chip provided of
course they are of a suitable size. In
these cases you would use the chip as a
sort of reservoir which on power up
downloaded its contents to the correct
place i n  computer Rain and then
jumps to and executes the code. A
relocate routine should be tagged on to
the end of the autostart program at
88025.
If you think this might be a bit
complicated t h e n  t h e  a d d - o n
manufactures can come to the rescue.
There a r e  E p r o m  g e n e r a t o r
programmes on the market that make
your N I / C  o r  Basic program and
create a ﬁle ready for burning onto a
chip. All the auto-start and relocate (if
required) is done for you. There are
also expander boards available that
accept up to 8x32K ROMS that can be
selected from a menu on power up. As
you can imagine it  would be very
convenient t o  h a v e  y o u r  w o r d
processor. database or favourite utility
available ins tantly . A g a i n  thes e
devices usually have the generator
program built in
Replacing Internal ROMS
There are a number of  replacement
operating system Reins on the market.
These include faster kernals. extended
Basics and alternative DOS chips. You
may however feel that you don't like a
particular aspect of these devices and
think you can improve them or you
may just want t o  do something as
simple as changing the screen power
up message and or colours.
When modifying the kernal one of
the main considerations is space since
Commodore have already ﬁlled the
chip w i t h  t heir  o w n  code. M o s t
alter nativ e k e r n a l s  o n  o f f e r
concentrate on fast disk operation and
so the extra space is  achieved by

removing the cassette routines. This is
the most obvious way to make room
for your code since this represents
about 2K. If more room is needed then
the RS232 routines could also be cut
down. A  f u l l  disassembly o f  the
kernals are listed in The Programmers
Handbook. The Basic ROM could of
course be given a similar treatment_
The internal ROMS are 8K 24 pin
devices on the 64 so an adaptor to
accept an Eprom (28 pins) is required.
By burning both the existing ROM and
the new system with your changes onto
a new I6K chip you would then be able
to bank through systems at will. Most
carrier boards available have this
feature indeed some offer the ability to
switch through as many as four or
eight banks.
Changes to drive DOS chips are for
the m o r e  experienced b u t  m in o r
changes can be made easily_ Again an
adaptor board would be required.
Some o f  the earlier parallel D o s
systems such as Speedos consisted of

Dos/Kernal chips and a cable to link

the computer t o  the drive. This  is
perhaps a slightly more complicated
area but it is certainly one with many
possibilities.
These types include external operating
systems, monitors and fas t loaders.
They rely on an Eprom board that can
'ﬂoat' in memory. This ﬂoating effect
is the ability of  the software on the
board to switch itself in and out of the
memory map. T his  is  a n obvious
advantage tor fastioaders and the like
which need to load into all parts o f
computer R A M  including the area
under themselves and then switch out
of the way.
This type o f  board is  different
because instead of EXROM line being
permanently set, it is controlled by the
software/board itself. This affects the
PLA as described earlier and you have
a 'now you see me now you don't'
situation.
Normally t h is  c ould create a
problem o f  its own since when the

cartridge is switched out, the code to
switch it  back in has gone. This is
where two special lines I/O I & 2 come
into action. Each o f  these cartridge
port lines enables or decodes a page
(256 bytes) a t  D E 0 0  a n d  DFOO
respectively_ W h a t  t h is  means i n
simple terms is that you have a page (or
two) available that does not go away
when the cartridge is switched out.
These two pages are rarely used by
programmers and so are an ideal place
to position the code for strobing the
cartridge in and out.
If you have an old fast loader
cartridge the chances are that it uses
this method. T hes e boar ds  a r e

I have touched only brieﬂy on each
of the various areas in an attempt to
illustrate the possibilities and perhaps

an exciting avenue and I  hope this

those ﬁrst steps.

COMMODORE DISK USER is a lot more than just
another computer magazine. Every issue
carries a diskette containing more than E30
worth of software ranging from serious
programming utilities to arcade games. There
are plenty of Commodore magazines on the
market, but we believe that this is the ﬁrst to
cater for disk users of all ages and tastes.
The MEGAVALUE ﬁrst issue will include on disc:
* 3  into 1 Plus - A superb all-purpose graphics
editor
*  Mobsters - An extremely addictive arcade
strategy game
*  Disk Designer - Revamp your disk director.
any way you like it.
*  Ski Run - A compulsive 3D winter sports
simulation. Break a legl
and lots more.
The magazine will include full details of
how to use the programs, plus a wealth
of reviews and features. This month we

A
the game, offer various features. Different skill levels, 3-D
graphics, joystick control or whatever. To date, it has been
very much a case of pick the accessories that you like the
best. Now your search is over.
The Chessmaster 2000 has the most comprehensive set of
features that 1 have yet witnessed in a single chess program.
Indeed, it is difﬁcult to think of anything that has been left
out. As  well as the eighteen skill levels plus an indeﬁnite
mode, there are special, easy and coffeehouse modes.
You can choose froom 2 and 3-D displays. rotate the
board, change the colour of the board, alter your method of
inputting moves (algebraic or joystick). set up the board to
solve speciﬁc problems, take back moves, replay a game, ask
for all legal moves to be displayed and even ask for a hint!
Partially played games or games that you wish to study
later can be saved to disk. The package also includes a
second disk containing 100 classic games ranging from the
seventeenth century to the 1985 Karpov - Kasparov World
Championship.
R E V I E W S
For those of you who like a brain- 4
straining challenge, then look over our
intellectual selection of games.
But these features are really only the icing on the cake.
The play's the thing. I t  is difﬁcult to assess how well a
program plays without setting up a series of games against
other machines or against a good player.
One of the nice things about a beginner or casual player
playing against the computer is that you can set the skill level
to be always that little bit better than you are.
Having played against most chest programs at some time
or other. I felt that Chessmaster was stomping all over me
where other programmes wouldn't have done so. There is no
quoted E L °  rating for the program but it does boast an
opening library of 71,000 moves.
As far as any beginner or  non-tournament player is
concerned, I would have no hesitation in saying that this was
the best chess program currently available both in terms of
playing skill and features. And I strongly suspect that all but
the very top players would ﬁnd Chessmaster 2000 a more
than useful opponent.

You are an aspiring burglar, but all crime in Kerovnia is
controlled by the Guild. If you want to keep any of your ill
gotten gains, you will need to become a fully paid up member
of the Guild or else risk becoming a permanent ﬁxture at the
bottom of the Kerovnian equivalent of the M25.
The Guild however does not let any old riff-Taff join. You
have to prove your ability ﬁrst. Your initiation test comes in
the form of a large mansion just waiting to be burgled. To
make sure that y ou don't tr y  t o  pull a  fast one, the
Guildmaster has cased the joint and knows exactly what
goodies lie around the Mace.

The game is almost a return to the very ﬁrst adventures,
1.e. a treasure hunt but you are never quite sure what is going
to be valuable before you store anything in the sage. Items
placed there cannot be retrieved again.
The storyline, the weak element in the Pawn, is much
improved and the game ﬂows very well with some excellent
and original puzzles to be solved.
I have already mentioned the parser as being state of the
art but Magnetic Scrolls are never satisﬁed. One additional
touch is that if you have previously examined a location, you
can type in 'Got() xxxx' and providing there are no problems
in the way, you will travel to your chosen destination via the
most direct route. A boon to people who can't be bothered to
draw maps.
The graphics a r e  again excellent a n d  hav e a n
Impressionist feel to them. You can choose to have either the
full picture. a small cameo in the top right hand corner of the
screen or even no pictures at all if you prefer text only games.
Superbly packaged with a copy of the latest What Burg/a,
magazine, which includes a coded hint section should you
get stuck, The Guild o f  Thieves deserves a place in any
adventurer's collection. Highly recommended.

LEGACY OF ANCIENTS
A
have never strayed far from home - you have never needed
to. All that is about to change, when one day you discover a
body out in the hills. The dead man is wearing a gold bracelet
and carrying a scroll and you feel compelled to take them,
even through your ﬁrst reaction is to run. Curiouser and
curiouser, especially when you see a large building in front of
you where none stood before.
The building is a museum and you wander round looking
at the various exhibits. Most of them require a jewelled coin
to access their information. You only have two jade coins at
present, but that is enough to start you on your adventure.
The geography of Tarmalon is large and varied. Towns
lie dotted around, but the land between them is treacherous,
and monsters lurk everywhere. A few will trade with you but
most are after your blood. At least, if you defeat them, you
can help yourself to the contents of their lair - usually gold!
As you start, so you have little idea of what your quest
entails and to make matters worse, you soon have the scroll
stolen. The towns are a good source of gossip, especially if
you have your fortune told. Here you can also buy weapons
and armour, food and magic spells. Healers are plentiful but
you need to perform a task before they will help you. Schools
allow you to improve some of your attributes, for a fee of
course. Money is always in short supply but there are places
where you try your hand at a couple of gambling games. It is
worth banking any proﬁts too as not only do you earn
interest, but your money stays put should you meet an early
demise.
There are many smaller quests to complete before you
get near your goal. Castles need to be explored and dungeons
ransacked. You will need to buy boats and bigger and better
weapons before eventually employing the services o f  a
winged messenger to ﬂy you to your ﬁnal confrontation.

Apart from moving your character, the game is entirely
menu-driven. The system works well and is v'ery simple to
use -  no huge list of different commands to learn. The
graphics come in two forms. A top down view for When you
are in the wilderness, towns or a castle and a 3-D view in the
dungeons and museum. T he dungeons especially are
accompanied by some excellent graphics for the monsters.

Legacy of Ancients, unlike some role-playing games, is
Very easy to get into. The plot more or less points you in the
right direction as to what you should do next and there is no
need for copious note taking. Despite that, it is no pushover
and I would estimate some 40-50 hours of gameplay. The
eliding is also nicely done as your exploits are recorded for

complex parsers that much anyway? The Pay' O f f  is a
welcome text-only budget offering, as a taster for those who
still haven't experienced the genre and are daunted by
Infocom prices.
Boy, are you in trouble! You owe the local bookmaker a
cool forty thousand green bucks and all you've got in the
world is €50 and a hot tip for the 4.30. How can you pay off
Luigi and place your bet in time?
You can try to place a bet with Luigi but his 'boys' eject
you without ceremony each time. All roads seem to lead to
dead ends until you discover a drainpipe. This leads you on
to discover that a fabulously expensive precious stone is due
in town. The answer to your prayers is about to fall in your
lap and all you have to do is work out where, when and how
you can steal the stone.
Although the vocabulary in this adventure is limited to
about 100 words, the game is not bounded by small-time
thinking. Completing your adventure takes guile and a fair
bit of shoe leather. How do you tackle a hidden sate? Short
out an electric fence? Sort out a human fence? From sewer to
penthouse you have to leave no stone unturned if Luigi is to
be placated in time. Cross him and he'll cross you with one of
those pretty white marble ones on Boot Hill.
Text-only adventures are making a come back as people
realise that a  lac k  o f  graphics means a n  excess o f
complexities within the logic of the game. All that has to be
done now is to alert the multiples that the tide is turning and
get them to stock the new games.

brain and furrow your brow. Buy it or you'll probably get a

Using the Program
It is best to place the program as the
ﬁrst ﬁle on the disk, in which it is to be
used. If the disk already has ﬁles saved
on it, then it is necessary to re-organise
the directory, so that a free space is
created at the top of the directory. The
new program saved to disk, will sit in
this place.
The re-organis ation m a y  b e
achieved, by the use of the COPY and
SCRATCH commands, e.g. if the ﬁrst
program on disk was called 'O LD',
then
COPY " O L D "  TO "T EMP"
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
85
would copy the ﬁle " O LD "  to a ﬁle
called "TEMP", elsewhere on the disk.
A check should be made, by listing the
directory, before:
SCRATCH " O LD "
RENAME "T EMP" TO " O LD"
The result is  that " O L D "  sits
further down the directory, and that a
free space at the top, has been created
for the disk menu program.
From BASIC, type:
DLO AD"DISK MENU HEADER"
after inserting the relative disk, and
then replace the disk onto which the
program is to be saved. Type in:
DSAVE " N AME"
where the NAME may be the title of
the disk. I t  is possible to insert the
Commodore control and colour codes
into the program name string. In the
case of the disk menu program, reverse
character mode c ould be used, t o
highlight the disk name.
I have included some pokes, which

 ne o f  the more useful features
provided b y  some o f  the W I M P
operating s y s tems  n o w  b e i n g
employed on new computers, is the
ability  t o  d e ﬁn e  t h e  d e f a u l t
characteristics o f  y o u r  computer,
rather than have them dictated to you
by the manufacturer. This means that
when you turn on your computer, it
retrieves a special ﬁle from the disk
drive w h i c h  c o n t a in s  a l l  t h e
information necessary t o set up the
system (e.g. screen colours, cursor
type, key repeats etc.). You could do
this manually every time, but it is time
consuming and will in any event be
reset as soon as you press RUN/STOP
and RESTORE.
Luckily, t h e  Commodore 1 2 8
automatically boots the disk drive at
switch on, so it has the ability to load
and execute a preferences ﬁle, but for
this to be really useful it is necessary to
be able to direct the computer to reset
the characteristics of the computer to
those in the preferences ﬁle every time
RUN/STOP a n d  R EST O R E a r e
pressed. This means that if a particular
program changes, f o r  example the
screen colours, you can reset them to
your preferred choice simply by hitting
RUN/STOP and RESTORE - which is
what this program enables you to do.

ﬁle, so that they should never rear their
ugly head again!
The ﬁrst is the split screen glitch — if
you type GRAPHICS 2,I<RETURN>
you w ill see at the junction o f  the
graphics screen and the text screen an
unsightly ﬂickering which is intensely
annoying, and really can spoil what
would otherwise be very professional
looking programs. The split screen is
handled by the editor interrupt routine
which has a vector at location $314.
So. by redirecting this vector to the
new interrupt routine, I have been able
to correct the bug.
Essentially, the problem o f  split
screen glitches occurs because of an
oversight b y  programmers. Now t o
explain this, I  am afraid that I shall
have to get a little technical, but bear
with me, as I have tried tosimplify it as
far as possible, Firstly, you must know
that a  television picture (such as
generated b y  y o u r  computer), i s
generated by ﬁring electrons in a beam
at the screen, which causes it to glow -
this beam of electrons moves from left
to right, generating each line on the
screen (raster lines). I n  or der  t o
program a split screen, the pixel line at
which the split is to occur is deﬁned.
and the computer causes an interrupt
to occur when t he beam o n  t he
television reaches this line.
Once this has occurred, the IRQ
routine is entered and the computer
has to determine what has caused the
interrupt, s inc e ther e a r e  several
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
87
possible causes. Then, when it is sure
the interrupt was for the split screen, it
can then change the screen mode for
the rest of the screen. However, all the
time the computer is deciding what
caused the interrupt, the television is
still drawing the picture, so by the time
the screen mode has changed, the
electron b e a m  w h ic h  dr aws  t h e
television picture, is halfway along the
line. Furthermore, the computer does
not always change the screen mode at
the same time, since its timing can not
be 100% precise, and so the position at
which t h e  s p lit  ac tually  oc c urs
oscillates about -  hence a  glitch is
produced.
Delaying Tactics
Now, good programmers take note of
this, and build a  delay into their
program once the split routine has
been entered, so that they can be sure
that the change will occur within the
border, and so any glitch will not be
seen. Y o u  m ig h t  w e l l  a s k  w h y
Commodore did not do this, after all
they ought to understand their own
machines, should they not? Well, after
inspecting the split routine, it seems
that they have tried to do it.
But what I suspect has gone wrong,
is that the UK operating system is the
same as the US one, but the US runs at
60 Hz, and the U K  at 50 Hz. This
means that there is  a  difference in

timing on the computer between the
two countries, which has not been
taken into consideration, and hence
the delay is not of the correct length to
ensure the glitch is pushed into the
border. Cure-change the length of the
delay, and the problem is solved.
The second bug is that in some of
the early Commodore 128s that were
shipped, the Caps-Lock Key did not
work with the letter Q. As a result,
when this key was depressed, you had
to use the SHIFT key to get a capital
Q, which was rather inconvenient,
especially if you forgot.
The reason for this niggling fault is
just one faulty byte in the Kemal
ROM. Within the Kernal, there are
several tables which deﬁne the ASCII
code which is to be returned for each
key-press — one for normal. Shift, C=,
Caps-Lock and the A l t key. Also
within the zero-page, are vectors which
point to  the start o f each o f these
tables. So all that is necessary to ﬁx this
bug is to produce a corrected version
of the faulty table and redirect the
vector towards the new version. This
vector, at S348/$349, is redirected to
the start of the new table,

allows you to set the default options,
which include:

40 column cursor ﬂashing, or solid
keys to repeat or not
Type of 80 column cursor (fast, or slow

checksums, so if you make a mistake
typing i n  the code, yo u  will b e
informed o f it once the program is
executed. The routine resides at $1300,
which is destined to become to the
CI 28 what $ U M  is to the C64 - a
special 'safe' section o f  memory in
which routines can be located without
fear o f being interfered by BASIC.
Once the options have been set, the
preference ﬁle is saved onto the disk,
and you are given the option of setting
up the boot sector to load the routine
when the machine is switched on. If
you wish to do so. you will probably
need a blank disk. This is because on a
used disk, the special section of the
disk used for booting, is quite likely to
contain a ﬁle. In any case, if you do use
a used disk and the boot sector is
occupied, the program will report this,
and not allow you to set it up.
For the cassette users, lines 1110 to
1380 can be omitted. The program can
then be loaded and executed at the

- he Video Title Shop is described as a computer and
T
VCR utility which can generate animated introductions to
your video tapes. This is obviously useful to those lucky few
who own a video camera, but also applies to anybody who
records and keeps anything, as well as being a way to
produce animated shop window displays.
The Video Title Shop is  supplied o n  disk and is
accompanied by a 48 page manual that takes you through
the steps o f  planning y our  sequence following t he
programmes Command bar prompts, using micropainter
plus to draw your backgrounds, adding text in a variety of
font sizes and colours and how to link it all together into a
sequence complete with scrolling and ﬁzzle effects. And of
course the all important instructions explaining how to
connect your computer to your video are also included.
Micro painter plus  is  a  straight forward graphics
package to use complete with solid and editable pattern ﬁles.
so interesting backdrops can quickly be created for your
sequences which are then saved to disk. The Video Title
Shop can then use these backdrops or canvases and a base
for a sequence.
A typical Video Title Shop sequence consists of four or
ﬁve pages. a couple of backgrounds and one or two special
effects. Each page is actually quite a lot bigger than your
computer screen so it's easy to create some text that din be
scrolled on to the screen. This text can appear in a variety of
font sizes and colours and is typed into an object. If you
want to mix text colours and sizes then you need a new

object for each style of text, if not then your entire page of
text can be a single object.
Once an object is created it can be moved around the
page to get the positioning exactly right.
A single page may be enough to announce that the video
tape contains the pictures taken at Fred's third birthday, but
for other occasions and advertising demos you'll want a
series of pages and you'll want to link them together in an
interesting way. The Video Title Shop makes this easy.
The number of pages you can have is only limited by the
C64's memory but since the ﬁnal sequence is to be recorded
on video tape you can record the whole sequence in two or
three sections (naturally the package will work with both
VHS and Betamax videos).
As I mentioned earlier you can scroll text across the
screen and you can also set up a timed page that will stay on
the screen for  any set time between 1/3 second and 15
minutes when the sequence continues. My favourite effect is
undoubtably the ﬁzzle in which a new page ﬁzzles over the
old one, pixel by pixel until the image is complete.
The Video Title Shop is actually little more than a
graphics package with built-in animator (and a few added
effects) but it could be just what you've been waiting for.

Kemal Expander.
Before assembling a cartridge you
need a programmed chip to put into it.
EPROMs are identical to the ROMs
already inside the C64 in all but one
respect. an EPRO M c an be erased
and r e p r o g r a m m e d .  D a t e l ' s
Eprommer 64 is tailored to the C64
and provides all you need to transfer
your program from memory to chip.
EPROMs hav e a  code number
which reveals their memory size. Most
codes start with 27 and the next two or
three characters reveal their memory
,
a 2K EPROM would have a value of
8*2 or 16. therefore its code would be
2716. this  coding leads t o a lot o f
misleading advertising where 2716
types a r e  r efer r ed t o  a s  1 6 K
(presumably 16 kilobits). through to
256K chips which are really only 32K.
Eprommer 64 is supplied with its
own software whic h controls t h e
hardware through the user ports. The
largest c hip which the system can
handle is the 27.256 (32K) which is
equivalent to half oftheC64s memory.
Before you start getting too excited
about this, let me explain that the
maximum space a cart ridge system can

access easily i s  a  bloc k  o f  I 6 K.
Furthermore, bec aus e t h e  C 6 4
cartridge system is designed to access
8K chips. a  16K chip can only  be
accessed as two 8K blocks this means
that two 8K programmes can be stored
in one cartridge. There is also a dual
I6K cartridge but 1t1 come to that
later.
Before you can use the Eprommer
effectively you have to penetrate the
mysteries o f  o n e  o f  t h e  wor s t
documented oriﬁces i n  c omputer
history. Commodor e t r eat  t h e i r
cartridge system like a trade secret and
for most owners it  is  inner space's
answer t o a  Black Hole
things go in but the where, how and
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
91
why of what happens next form part of
the greatest enigma known to man.
Fortunately Datel have unravelled
the mystery and their 20 page manual
lays bare the inner secrets o f  the
cartridge operating system.
What it boils down to is that the
system can be tricked into thinking
that your cartridge is a normal part of
C64 memory  occupying locations
$8000-89EEE. When t he computer
powers up. among other things, it does
a test to ﬁnd i f  the code CBM80 is
stored at location $8004. This is the
autostart key and causes the normal
reset routine to abort in favour of the
cartridge and a  jump is made to a
vector pointed to by $8000-01.

The user program can only run in
cartridge space unless a  routine is
included w hic h w i l l  transfer a n d
execute it in normal RAM space.
Obviously, this means a  certain
number of modiﬁcation will have to be
made to your program before loading
up your EPROM. Dates  Eprommer
software allows for this by including a
monitor a s  w e l l  a s  t h e  f u l l y
comprehensive chip burner.
Blow Keys
Once prepared. the programming of
the chip is child's play. The computer
displays a menu and using single key
presses the parameters for the save can
be set.
First of all the type of EPROM is
selected by scanning through all live
alternatives from 2716 to 27256. This
also alters the display t o the most
commonly used voltage and speed for
the b u r n .  Befor e proceeding it ' s
important to check that the voltage is
not too high for the chip you're using,
otherwise permanent damage will be
caused. If the voltage or speed is wrong
it can he changed independently by
cycling through the alternatives using
the relevant key.
My sample EPROM. part o f  the
Cartridge System k it, was rated at
about half the voltage automatically
suggested by the program. Perhaps it
would have been better if Datel had set
all the voltages to the low 12.5 volts
and le t  t h e  user increase this  as
necessary.
There a r e  thr ee programming
speeds between 3 and 50ms. 3ms is too
fast for some chips. 4ms is more usual
and 50ms is only used for older 2716
and 2732 EPROMS.
Normally the program for transfer
will be stored in RAM but occasionally.
you may want to back up a kernal chip.
Selecting ROM using the asterisk key
switches in the ROM chip ready for
reading.
Today's chips can have such large
memories t h a t  y o u  may  w ant t o
program it in 8K blocks. An AL L  or
RANGE toggle is provided for this
purpose. When set to ALL the whole
chip w i l l  b e  programmed b u t  o n
RANGE it depends on which range
has been set.
To s e t  a  r ange requires t h e
minimum Of thought. All you need to
know is where your program starts in •
memory. its length and where it will
H A R D W A R E  R E V I E W
start on the EPROM. Remember that
the location of the program in memory
at bur n t ime  need n o t  hear  any
relationship to its eventual location in
memory at run time. all this is preset
under cartridge program control later.
The s tar t a n d  length o f  t h e
program are easily entered if you know
h e x a d e c ima l.  W h e n  D a t e l ' s
programmer has time on his hands he
may l i k e  t o  a d d  a  decimal/hex
calculator to the menu screen.
The EPROM position is very easily
worked out. The ﬁrst program goes on
at loc ation $000 a n d  subsequent
programs normally  g o  o n  a t  8 K
intervals. 1 K is S400 bytes therefore
the second program will start at S2000.
Several D O S  commands als o
appear o n  t h e  screen: direc tory
display, disk commands, loading and
saving. These are supplemented by a
'Fill' command which pokes a zero byte
into all memory locations within the
limits set as the program range.
The remaining commands are the
vitally important EPROM commands.
Firstly, you can check i f  the chip is
blank. I f  not y ou must follow the
correct procedure to wipe the memory
using ultr a- v iolet r a d ia t io n f o r
EPROMs o r  the specially included
erase function for EEPROMs.
The next step is  t o  write y our
program t o  the chip (burning) and
then verify it against the RAM source.
For those doubting Thomas's who
want further convincing, you can also
read the EPROM into memory again.
This comes in useful when you want to
hack up a commercial EPROM. suck

Now you have your [pr om you can

Cartridge Development System has a
ready to blow 16K EPROM and all the
boards and components (all four of
them) necessary to set up your board.
A reset switch is already ﬁtted next to a
switch to allow the selection of which
half of the I 6K EPROM you are using.
The supplied cartridge casing has two
cutouts through which the switches
will protrude.
Also included in the package is a
full 20 page explanation of cartridge
theory and assembly. With a minimum
of soldering ability, most people will
be able t o  produce professional-
looking cartridges.
The other cartridge containing the
16K EPRO M Board can hold two
27128s which may  be switched into
memory at S8000 and SA(X)0 giving
I6K o f  contiguous R AM  ( 8K from
each chip). As  with the single chip
version the other halves o f  the two
chips can be used to store another I 6K
program.
The only problems I found with the

After ﬁt t i n g  t h e  c h i p  y o u r
problems are not over, the currently
ﬁtted D I L  sockets which hold the
EPROM are too thick. Fitting the Iwo
halves of the cartridge together leaves
a gap around the edge which. although
small, detracts from the professional
look of the product.
A ﬁnal point, concerning the 16K
Board (inks, is that the bank switches
on the dual chip cartridge are internal.
Everytime the user wants to switch
from one program to the other. the
cartridge has to be unscrewed, opened.
switched and then closed.
With the inclusion of t wo excellent
battery
(Smart Cart) in Datel's catalogue, the
question must be asked: Why bother
with burning when Smart Carts are so
cheap?

The cost of a Smart Cart is £14.99
for an 8 K  pack. F o r  a  Cartridge

board is  an electronic noticeboard.
which permits two-way communic-
ation. This means that the user can
obtain information and contribute to
the s y s tem. I t  d if f e r s  f r o m  a

there a r e  n o  closed us er groups
(CUGs) and there are no individual

organising each conference.
Conferencing systems are usually
run by commercial organisations and
the subject matter is  very diverse.
Whereas bulletin boards are usually.
but not always, run by the hobbyist
and t h e  subject matter is  usually
specialised in as much as the topics are
related to a speciﬁc hobby or interest,
e.g. PCs . Commodore Computers,
Amateur Radio, etc.
Flow do Bulletin Boards Work
Basically, there are two different ways
in which they work. Either you phone
C O M M U N I C A T I O N S
Bulletin
Boards
Continuing our computer communications series,. this
month we look at the various uses of bulletin boards.
By Jennifer Goldsmith
them and when the modem answers,
you connect y our  modem i n  t h e
appropriate manner for y OU r software,
and then you log on. Or, after you
phone the bulletin board, you hang up
and t h e  bulletin board's  modem
phones you back. This latter type of
logging on is not so common as it is
more expensive to implement but it
does give greater security. If you go to
log on to a bulletin board after having
used a commercial system like Prestel,
you m a y  ﬁnd t h e  bulletin boar d
unfriendly.
Exactly what is  required differs
from system to system but you will ﬁnd
that often y our  name is  required
followed by a carriage return or hash.
Never, ever, divulge your Prestel !Dor
password. or  any password on any
other system (unless everything is free
and y ou have nothing t o  loose by
doing so!).
Some bulletin boards, especially
those whose software originated in
the USA, operate at 300/300 baud
scrolling. However, with the growth in
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
98
popularity i n  the U K  o f  viewdata
systems, s ome software has  been
written for bulletin boards using this
format, i.e. colour and 1200/75 baud.
Therefore as mentioned in the October
issue, you have to make sure that you
have the appropriate software and that
the m o d e m  a n d  s oftw ar e a r e
compatible.
Growing in Popularity
One of the reasons why bulletin boards
have become popular, is that anyone
can set them up. For example, a C64
with disk drive, autoanswer modem
and bulletin board software for the 64
costing .09, which is available from Y
Computing, is all you need.
However, many  o f  the popular
boards have a hard disk attached. This
allows a n  increase i n  speed o f
operation a n d  allows  muc h more
material t o be available to the user.
For example. with a  1541. only a

case of  viewdata compatible boards)

Kards)
could be stored, but with a hard disk.
thousands of frames could be stored
and/or much telesoftware as well.
Therefore, bulletin boards are not only
expensive to set up but they are also
hard work.
For this reason, you will ﬁnd that
access t o  some bulletin boards is
restricted to  certain hours only, yet
others are available 24 hours. No-one
can give you hard and fast rules lArhen
it comes to bulletin boards as there
are about 200 in the UK. thousands in
the USA, and the number is on the
increase.
You m a y  have difﬁculty i n
accessing popular boards, as many
people are trying simultaneously and
there is usually only one phone line,
which means of course that only one
person can use the system at any given
time, You must bear this in mind when
you're using a bulletin board, so that
you minimise the time you are on-line
in order to let others on the system.
Listings of Bulletin Boards
It would b e  very difﬁcult a n d
impractical f o r  me  t o  provide a
complete listing of bulletin boards in
the UK. There are various sources for
lists, ﬁrstly th e  Bulletin Boards
Operators Association, which is an
association to which systems operators
(sysops) can belong. This information
is also supplied to ClubSpot on Prestel.
However, these sources of lists are not
currently available as unfortunately
they were destroyed in a ﬁre, and are in
the process of being re-compiled at the
moment.
The other source o f lists is the
magazine Telelink, which comes out
six times a year. I t  is a magazine
wholly devoted to communications in
the U K and a t E 15 for two years
subscription, i t  i s  a  MUST. Just
contact Database Publications o n
Prestel MBx 614568383 or on Telecom
Gold 72:M AG001 and credit cards are
an acceptable means of payment.
Finding Your Way About
There is no easy way of knowing what
bulletin b o a r d s  h a v e  w h a t
information. E i t h e r  y o u  g e t
information from your friends and
colleagues or you just phone around.
Anyway to get you going, here is a

0902 745337. (It may be on PSS but I
am not sure.) What is unique, is that
(to m y  knowledge) i t  i s  entirely.
devoted t o  Commodore users,
covering all machines including the
Amiga. There is an increasing amount
of telesoftware. It is available 24 hours
on b o th  300/300 a n d  1200/75
scrolling.
The next bulletin board is devoted
purely to a hobby. In this case it is
Amateur Radio. The Radio Society of
Great Britain run a bulletin board (tel:
0707 52242) which is available 24
hours o n  1200/75 baud viewdata
format. Normally only one phone line
is available but 1 believe it is hoped that
two lines will be in use before long.
This bulletin board has a fairly
large database on various aspects of
amateur radio, including band plans, a
diary of events, rallies and contests,
information on morse tests and the
radio amateurs examination (me).
news from both home and abroad,
packet radio, solar propagation, club
information and news, R AYN  ET,
repeaters and beacons, books and
other products w h i ch  c a n  b e
purchased f r o m  R SGB, R SGB
services, satellites and information for
beginners.
In addition t o  this, there are
response frames for ordering books,
etc. b y credit cards, fo r obtaining
information and you can write your
own messages as well. Unlike most
boards, i t is updated most working
days as a full-time editor/database
manager is employed.
The Gnome at Home is a very
popular board which supports six
phone lines 24 hours a day. Two of
these phone lines are for the general
public, the other four are kept for the
paying subscribers. Subscription i s
very cheap and only costs E1.50 a
month which is well worth while, just
to be able to access the board more
readily. The two lines for the public are
on 01-888 889,4 at 1200/75 baud, using
viewdata compatible software.
The London Underground bulletin
Board is available 24 hours on 01-863
0198 on 300/300, 1200/75 and 1200
full duplex and has about 4000 callers a
year. This is quite good, but I believe
RSGB has between 14-37 callers a day.
However, this bulletin board runs on a
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987

PC whereas RSGB's database uses a
BBC. Both make use of a hard disk as
does the Commodore one which also
uses a PC clone,
There are tw o  BABBS boards.
BABBS stands f o r  British Apple
Bulletin Board System, They run at
300 baud, are sponsored by BASUG,
British Apple Systems User Group and
are available 24 hours a day on 0394
276306 and 0268 778956.
Robert O'Donnell's bulletin board
in Manchester was the ﬁrst bulletin
board to use a BBC micro and colour.
Robert has worked for a few computer
companies and has even written his
own communication software. His
board co ve rs m o s t  interests,
something for everyone — adventure,
BBC software, jokes and advertise-
ments. N o  wonder Micronet are
currently employing him!! Rob's
board is available 24 hours at 300 baud
on 061-427 1596.
Lynn Hurd, who is the svsop for
the Communitree Hope bulletin board
in Powys, Wales was most probably
the ﬁrst female svsop in the UK. There
are currently only about three of four
female sysops on the UK (in over 200
boards!).
One important point is that in
order to access the board you do NOT
have to be using the same computer as
the one which is running the board.
For example, a BBC may be running
the RSGB board but any computer
which has viewdata compatible
software using 1200/75 will be able to
access it.
Accessing Boards in America
The bulletin board industry i n
America i s ,  unl i ke  i t s  Bri ti sh
counterpart, very organised. Mo st
States operate on what is known as
Bell frequencies. The UK (CCIT) tones
do not work in the USA (and Canada).
Therefore your modem will have to be
able to cope with the Bell frequencies.
The bell frequencies, in Hertz, are:
Bell 103 (300 baud) i s Originate:
transmit 1070 (0) 1270 (1) : receive
2025 (0) 2225 (1). Bell 202 (1200 baud)
transmit and receive 2200(0) 1200(1).
This is half-duplex and is the same
as our 1200 half-duplex. However the
300 baud is not the same as the British
300 baud.
• Once yo u  have overcome the
problem of the Bell tones, your next
problem will be the logging on. As

when you log on, most systems will ask
you yo u r  telephone number. I n
America these are always quoted in the
format XXX: XXX: XXXX. This is
ﬁne i f  yo u r phone number i s
061:123:4567 but if you live in London
instead of quoting your phone number
as 01:123:4567 you will need to add an
additional zero before the 01.
Once you have logged on, do not
get upset i f the system seems a little
slow, just remember that i t is most
probably supporting more than one
phone line (otherwise you would not
have got one!) and also that all sysops
are volunteers and under no obligation
to provide a service.
In the USA, there are something
like 4,000 or so bulletin boards, so
again a complete listing is impossible.
but here are a few for you to be getting
on with.
Chicago (CP/M Users) 0101-404636-
6130 on Bell 300.
California (Dial Your match) 0101-
209-298-1328 Bell 300.

Compunet works at 1200/75 baud and
you have to use its unique software
which will only work with the CBM
modem. The ﬁrst time you log on to
Compunet, a fte r registering and
obtaining your password, you will see
the message LINKING. When you
quit the system, you must save the
software, to  avoid having to LINK
again, by doing a CNSAVE. When you
next go to log on to the system, you will
type in the command. CNLOAD, the
software will load from your disk, you
then type CONNECT, hit RFTURN
and the software, which will have
stored the phone number, will autodial
for you. You will be able to see when
you are connecting to Compunet as the
colour of the screen changes from blue
to violet.
Cornpunet like many bulletin
boards has an area in which you can
load your own material. On Compunet
this area is called the Jungle. Yes, you
can even sell your own programmes on
Compunet providing you are willing to
let Compunet take some of the money
as commission! Happy Hunting! W t

It's easy to complain
about advertisements.
But which ones?
Every week milhons of advertisements appear in pnnt. on posters or in the cinema.
Most of them comply with the rules contained in the British Code of Advertising
Practice.
But some of them break the rules and warrant your complaints
If you're not sure about which ones they are, however, drop us a line and well
send you an abridged copy of the Advertising Code Then, if an advertisement
bothers you. you'll be justiﬁed in bothering us.
The Advertising Standards Authority
If an advertisement is wrong,wre here to put it right.

T
5x5 grid of numbers between one and
ﬁve is presented. Player one can move
a column one place up or down (with a
wraparound effect) to produce either a
winning sequence of 1,2,3,4,5 reading
up, down, left or right; or to produce
scoring sequences o f  2,3,4 o r  5
identical numbers in a line (up or
down). Player two (or C64 if in one
player mode) then has to move a row
one place backwards or forwards with
the same aim.
The winner is the ﬁrst to produce
either a 1,2,3,4,5 sequence or the ﬁrst
to create a large differential in points
which will remove the opponents bar
marker from the bottom of the screen,
Both methods result in a 100 points
bonus.
To add to the fun, after all 3, 4 and
5 number scoring sequences, at least
two of the numbers are changed by one
count in either direction. There arc not
random changes but they are ex-
plained more fully in the program.
In 1 player mode, a pre-selected
level of Ito  5 gives the computer 20%
to 100% chance o f  achieving the
highest obtainable score for its turn,
but will always detect a  1,2,3,4.5
sequence if one is available. The higher
the level, the longer the time the
computer needs to respond, but this is
indicated on screen via a countdown
timer.

Other than the random selection of
the initial grid the game is totally
logical and requires careful thought.
Games may last a couple of minutes to
half an hour or more, depending on
intellect between players or the level
selected.
Getting it in
The program is presented in two parts;
the ﬁrst contains all the data for m/c
sequences and U.D.Gs and also for
copying character sets. The DATA
LOADER must be typed and saved

before the Number Tumble program.
A small normalising program has
also been given because if RUN/STOP
and RESTORE buttons are used after
running the main program the screen
blanks and no typing can be seen. This
is due to  the banks, screens and
characters having been shifted around.
Type RUN 10000 (even though you
can't see it) and the computer will
return to normal after RETURN has
been pressed. This add-on program
proved useful during development of
the game and may similarly help while
de-bugging takes place.

computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb proLoammes from Your Commodore
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R,
U and N . You press RETURN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programmes from each issue on both cassette and
disk at a price of E6.00 for disk and E4.00 for cassette. None of
the documentation for the programmes is supplied with the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:

please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Disk
Programmes on the disk will also be supplied as totally
• working versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic
Loaders thus making use of the programmes much easier.
Unfortunately at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and
Plus/4 cassettes. However programmes for these machines
will be available on the disk.
What programmes are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programmes are available on which format you will also ﬁnd
a couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the

Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program, we do not put disk-only programmes
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

Communications
Corner
AIN A N  UNEXPECTED move,
major tariff changes for the Telecom
Gold system were made i n  early
August. T h e  good news is that the
peak rate time charge is now 6.5p per
minute, down from lip, and that the
off-peak rate is now 2p, down from
3.5p The bad news is that Telecom
Gold has imposed a E5 per month
subscription fee on every mailbox.
But by far the most controversial
change is a new tariff for data transfer.
Each block 01'512 characters sent to or
from Telecom Gold will cost the user
4p at peak time and Ip off-peak — with
the ﬁrst 512 characters free. This
means that a 1000 word document will
on average cost 48p at peak time or 12p
off-peak to read or send.
The new tariff structure will affect
all users across the board, especially
domestic users as they will not be able
to offset the cost o f using Telecom
Gold as a company expense. Further,
domestic users tend to make extensive
use o f areas on Gold that rely on
sending/receiving text such as Email,
news areas, and on system 72 which is
operated by Microlink — the bulletin
board facility.
Almost overnight, the new pricing
structure has changed Telecom Gold
from being one o f  the most cost-
effective databases, to one of the most
expensive. For example, a user wishing
to facilitate o n e  o f  the on-line
information services such as Fintech
C O MMS  N E W S
David Janda is back with snore news and views from the
communictions world.
will have to  pay the information
provider a time charge for accessing
the database as well as the connect
charge and the data transfer charge
imposed by Telecom Gold. Worse still,
users accessing Gold via PSS also have
to pay a data transfer charge on top of
that. Add to all this the cost of the
phone ca l l  t o  y o u r  local PSS
node/Gold port and the cost begins to
add up!
Mieronet Goes for Gold
However, there is a way to avoid the E5
subscription fee and the cost of long
distance phone calls, and yet still have
access to all the facilities of Telecom
Gold — by simply joining Micronet_
Interlink i s  th e  name o f  a
'gateway' th a t enables Micronet
subscribers to be connected through to
Telecom Gold. From within Micronet,
the user goes to the Interlink front
page (
and presses •1' to make the connection.
Once this is done, the user logs on by
caHing system 74, enters their ID and
password, and is through to Telecom
Gold, some clever software converts
Gold's 80 column format to 40 column
that's required by Prestel. At the end of
each frame the user is prompted to
press RETURN; the screen will then
clear and more text, if any, will follow.

subscribers must ﬁrst register online.
Once done, you will be provided with
your own Telecom Gold mailbox
which you can access throgh Interlink,
or by accessing Telecom Gold directly.
there i s  n o  registration fee and
Interlink members do not have to pay
the E5 subscription fee each month.
There is a charge of lp per minute for
using the gateway, but when you take
into account local call access for
Prestel/Micronet subscribers and the
waiving o f the E5 subscription fee,
accessing Telecom Gold via Interlink
is very cost effective, Consider the
following subscription charges for a
period of one year:
Telecom Gold: E 6 0
Prestel: 
E
2
6
Micronet/Prestel: E66
Subscribing to Telecom Gold and
Prestel will cost E86 per year, yet
subscribing to Micronet (which also
means subscribing t o  Prestel as
Micronet is an information providere
on the Prestel database) will get you all
three services for E66 — and that is
exceptional value for money.
According t o  Micronet's PR
manager. David Rosenbaum, Prestel
are currently developing on an 80
column gateway which can be used

Compunet Changes
SEVERAL MAJOR CHANGES have
happened at Compunet over the last
few months. First, Compunet has
'moved' the Whole database onto their
new ' m a i n f r a m e '  c o m p u te r .
Previously, the service was run on a
DEC 10 mainframe computer which
was a timesharing system. The result
was slow logon time, slow page access.
slow everything. However, with their
new mainframe, which consists of a
series of 68020 microprocessors, things
should b e  speeded u p .  N e w
applications software has been written
in C .  a n d  single processors are
allocated to individual tasks such as
updating the directory.
There should be several beneﬁts to
the subscriber as a result of the move.
Firstly speed — the time taken to move
through th e  database should b e
improved dramatically. Capacity will
be doubled, allowing more people to

subscribe. Facilities such as the multi-
user game (MUG) Federation is now
available and may soon be followed by
Gods. Including MUD, this would
bring the number of MUGs to three
on the system. Compunet also intend
to cater for micros other than the
C64/Cl28 in the near future. The BBC
micro was to have been the ﬁrst of
these micros, b u t  th e  plan t o
accommodate t h e  B e e b  w a s

Finally, t h e  c o s t o f  using
Compunet has gone down — well, sort
of. Previously, a  subscriber could
access Compunet by calling one o f
several numbers that were scattered
around th e  country. These 'free'
numbers have been scrapped and
everyone must access the  service
through the Istel network. Istel prices
have gone down to lp per minute, and
the cost of accessing Compunet during
peak hours has gone down to 60p per
hour for London users and E4 for all
other users.

Obviously the price reductions are
a move in the right direction. But what
seems unfair is the removal of the free

The cost of accessing Compu net in the

an Istel port during the off-peak period
and the !stet charge: the total is £1.04

the life-blood of adventures. Since text
is RAM hungry, this section will utilise
the unused RAM lurking behind the
ROMs. The actual code is quite small
but it needs four tables occupying I K.
In order to print text, we need to know
two things. First we need the start
address of the text and secondly some
way of knowing when the text ends.
In this case, I will use a zero byte as
a sentinel to mark the end of each piece
of text. Since only simple indexed
addressing is used, each block of text is
limited to 256 bytes. The actual text is
stored in an uncompressed form to
allow you the full use of characters and
control codes. I f  you want to use
compressed storage, refer to my article
in Your Commodore (September 1987)
which covers it.
How the Code works
Before I describe the editor for this
section, I will give some detail on how
the code works, for those of you who
want to write their own editor. The
syntax for the code is:
SYS 5 1 9  6 8,BANK,MESSAGE
NO,LINE
Bank refers to the block of RAM
concerned and has the values:
0 =  area below the BASIC ROM
C64 P R O G R A MMI N G E
Adventure
Kit II
Continuing our adventure writing series, this month we
look at everything you need to know about the text,
By Alien Webb
between 40960 (SA000) and 49151
(SBFFF)
1 =  area below the Kernal ROM
between 57344 ($E000) and 65535
(SFFET)
This give a  total of about 16K for
text.
MESSAGE N O  i s  s e l f -
explanatory and has the value between
0 and 255. The editor initialises the
table values to zero. If you try to call a
non-existant message the zero bytes
are detected and you get a ﬂashing
border to warn you of your error. This
action does not, however, termminate
execution of your BASIC program.
LINE refers the starting line for the
message. Th e  normal scrolling as
occurs with PRINT will be envoked.
The memory used by the code is as
follows:
SCBOO-SCBFF....main code
SCCOO-SCCFF....low byte table for
BASIC ROM area
SCBOO-SCBFF..
SCCOO-SCCFF..
SCDOO-SCDFF,
SCE00-SCEFF..

for BASIC ROM
area
..low byte table for
KERNAL ROM
area
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
108
SCFOO-SCEFF....high byte table for
KERNAL ROM
area
The sta rt addresses o f  each
message are kept in the above tables.
For example, the low byte (LB) of the
start address of message I under the
BASIC R OM i s  held i n  location
SCCOI (52225). Similarly, the high
byte (HB) is i n SCD01. The start
address of the message is then given by:
Address = HB x 256 +LB
The editor given seems rather
disproportionately large for the code it
serves, but my reasons for using mostly
machine code are simple. Any text
editor written i n  BASIC will be
sluggish and the other operations
involved w i l l  give a n  unwieldy
program. The main editor is called by a
short lump of BASIC. It is driven by a
main menu screen which also gives
help and shows the current memory
usage in each blank.
The t w o  memory banks are
handled separately and you can only
work on one at a time. You can toggle
between them by pressing Fl, and the
border colour will change accordingly.
This option is selected from the main
menu only. Subsequent actions such as
initialisation and text entry act on the
current bank.

The Text Editor
The editor screen carries three blocks
of information. First, at the top of the
screen you are shown the length of the
message being typed in. The text buffer
shows the actual RAM contents. This
allows you to see control codes, etc.
This buffer is ﬁlled with zero bytes (the
'@• characters). Because a zero byte is
used as a sentinel, you may not use the
character '@• in yout text.
The bottom buffer shows how the
text will look on screen. This buffer is
updated each time a key is pressed. The
normal colour and reverse ﬁeld keys
are available so you can get the effect
you want. Once RETURN is pressed,
the text is stored in RAM. Once this is
done, you can't change the message -
so beware! When RETURN is pressed,
the editor will wait for a key press.
Press " - "  if you want to return to the
main menu or any other key to deal
with the next message.
The restriction on editing messages
once entered was forced on me i f I
wanted t o  keep th e  code t o  a

reasonable length. I f  you w o rk
everything out on paper ﬁrst (as you
should) this shouldn't be a limitation.
The saving and loading o f text
presents slight complications. Since
the text is hiding behind ROMs, direct
saving and loading was not possible.
As i t is, cassette users will Find i t
awkward to load to these areas. The
MOVER code does this job. I t
compacts the required text bank into
lower memory as follows: 
•
text
address tables
number of
m e s s a g e s
end address+I of
text
This handy block is easier to save
and load. The MOVER code has four
entry points:
SYS 49152 Download BASIC ROM
area
SYS 49155Upload BASIC ROM area
SYS 49158 Download Kemal ROM
area
YOUR COMMODORE november 1987
109
SYS 49161 Upload Kemal ROM area
You may need to incorporate this
code in the loader to your adventure,
unless you use a machine code monitor
to save code (although this will occupy
more than one ﬁle).
To use the editor, you must have
the following code in memory:
1. The text code.
2. The MOVER code.
3. The Editor code,
If this seems all a bit involved, fear
not, I will give a loader at the end of
this series which will load all the data
blocks for you although, inevitably,
this will be separate to  your main
adventure code. More on that later on.
One last point about the text
editor. If you use the RVS ON control
code to highlight part of your text, you
will note that the whole of your text
will be printed in reverse. Fear not,
provided that you include a RVS OFF
at the required place. all will be well.
This is simply a foible of the way the
editor works.

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more.
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA 10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S-1-2] means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-1-2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC4] o r, exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding

down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],[C*]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic, Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine key
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOIIR COMMODORE november 1987

: C C = 2
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie, the pi symbol).

At the start of each programming
session, load Cheeksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct it  and

If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49I52 and the screen

You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
