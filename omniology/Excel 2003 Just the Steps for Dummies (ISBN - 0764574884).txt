Introduction
W
elcome to the world of Microsoft Excel, the most popular and powerful
spreadsheet program in the world. You may ask...what is a spreadsheet
program? A spreadsheet is a computer program with a huge grid designed to
display data in rows and columns where you can create calculations to per-
form mathematical, logical, and other types of operations on the data you
enter. You can sort the data, enhance it, and manipulate it a plethora of ways
including creating powerful charts and graphs from it. Whether you need a list
of names and addresses, or a document to calculate next year’s sales revenue
based on prior years’ performance, Excel is the application you want to use. 
About This Book
This book provides the tools you need to successfully tackle the potentially
overwhelming challenge of using Microsoft Excel. Through this book you
find out how to create spreadsheets; however, what you create is totally up
to you. Your imagination is the only limit! 
Why You Need This Book
Time is of the essence and most of us don’t have the time to do a lot of
reading. We just need to get a task done, effectively and efficiently. This book
is full of concise, easy to understand steps designed to get you quickly up
and running with Excel by taking you directly to the steps for a desired task,
without all the jibber-jabber that often accompanies other books. 
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into eighteen different chapters broken into five con-
venient parts:
Part I: Putting Excel to Work
In Chapter 1, you uncover the basics of working with Excel files, such as open-
ing, closing, and saving files, while in Chapter 2, you work with entering the

different types of data into Excel worksheets, and in Chapter 3,
you create various types of formulas and functions to perform
worksheet calculations.
Part II: Sprucing Up Your Spreadsheet
Chapter 4 shows you how to dress up the data you enter into a
worksheet, including data alignment, formatting values, chang-
ing fonts, colors, and cell borders. In Chapter 5, you also work
with graphics such as arrows and clip art. Then in Chapter 6,
you work with multiple worksheets, hyperlinks and worksheet
protection, and passwords.
Part III: Viewing Data in Different Ways
This part shows how you modify how Excel displays certain
workbook options on your screen. Chapter 7 illustrates chang-
ing the worksheet views. In Chapter 8, you sort your data
making it easier to locate particular pieces of information. In
Chapter 9, you create charts to display your data in a superb
graphic manner and in Chapter 10 you work with the different
output methods, including printing, for your worksheets.
Part IV: Analyzing Data with Excel
Use these chapters to effectively analyze all the data you
input into a worksheet. In Chapters 11, 12, and 13, you
work with Excel Outlines, Filters, and Pivot Tables.
Chapters 14 and 15 show some of the timesaving
data entry tools included with Excel.
Part V: Practical Applications for Excel
Go to these chapters to save yourself time with a commis-
sion calculation worksheet (Chapter 16), a medical expense
tracking worksheet (Chapter 17), and Chapter 18 which
helps you plan for your future by planning to purchase a
house, pay off a credit card balance, and save for college
or retirement. Chapters 19 through 21 show how you 
can use Excel with the other Office programs — Word,
Powerpoint, and Access.

Working with 
Excel Files
Your PC probably has many different computer programs loaded on
it, but you’ll not likely find one that is as versatile as Microsoft Excel.
Throughout the course of this book, you discover methods to use Excel as a
spreadsheet of course, but also as a database, a calculator, a planner, and even
a graphic illustrator. But as with most things in life, you need to figure out
the basics before you can carry out the more advanced actions.
In this chapter, you
➟
Discover the fundamental measures needed when working with Excel
files; basic operations to file management such as opening, closing,
and saving files. 
➟
Meet Clippit, the animated Office Assistant, who stands by your virtual
screen waiting for a question from you. Clippit takes your question to
the Excel Help system, both local and over the Internet, searching to
provide the best answer to your inquiry. 
➟
Customize what you see on the Excel screen, thereby making it easier
and faster for you to use. 
➟
Use workbook properties to better manage your files and provide a
means to search for those files that sometimes mysteriously get lost
in a computer hierarchy.

Chapter 1: Working with Excel Files

Entering Spreadsheet
Data
You can enter three primary types of data in a spreadsheet: labels, values,
or formulas. Labels are traditionally descriptive pieces of information
such as names, months, or other identifying statistics and usually include
alphabetic characters. Values are generally raw numbers or dates and formu-
las are results of calculations. 
The first part of this chapter shows how you can easily enter labels and val-
ues into your worksheet. But, alas, none of us are perfect and you may need
to correct your mistakes. So I also show you how to delete incorrect entries,
duplicate data, or move it to another area of the worksheet. You even dis-
cover an Excel feature that prevents worksheet cells from accepting the 
incorrect data.

Chapter

Change the Active Cell
1.
Open a spreadsheet in Excel. The formula bar displays the
active cell location. A single worksheet has 256 columns
across and 65536 rows down. Columns display the letters
from A to IV and rows display numbers from 1 to 65536.
A cell address is the intersection of a column and a row
such as D23 or AB205.
2.
Move the cursor to an adjacent cell with one of the fol-
lowing techniques:
• Down: Press the Enter key or the down arrow key.
In Figure 2-1, I’ve moved the cursor from E9 to E10.
• Up: Press the up arrow key.
• Right: Press the right arrow key 
• Left: Press the left arrow key.
3.
To move to a cell farther away, use one of these 
techniques: 
• Click the mouse pointer on any cell to move the
active cell location to that cell.
• Choose Edit➪Go To (or press F5). The Go To dialog
box displays, as shown in Figure 2-2. In the Reference
box, enter the cell address you want to make active,
and then click OK. 
• Press Ctrl+Home. Excel jumps to cell A1.
• Press Ctrl+End. Excel jumps to the lower-right cell of
the worksheet.
• Press Ctrl+PageDown or Ctrl+PageUp. Excel moves to
the next or previous worksheet in the workbook.

Chapter 2: Entering Spreadsheet Data

Enter Data 
1.
Type the label or value in the desired cell.
2.
Press Enter. The data is entered into the current cell
and Excel makes the next cell down the active cell.
(See Figure 2-3.) How Excel aligns the data depends
on what it is:
• Label: Excel aligns the data to the left side of the cell.
If the descriptive information is too wide to fit in a
cell, Excel extends that data past the cell width as
long as the next cell is blank. If the next cell is not
blank, Excel displays only text meeting the display
width. Widening the column displays additional text. 
To enter a value as a label, type an apostrophe before the value.
• Whole value: Excel aligns the data to the right side of
the cell. 
• Value with a decimal: Excel aligns the data to the
right side of the cell, including the decimal point,
with the exception of a trailing 0. For example, enter-
ing 246.70 displays 246.7. The trailing zero is not
lost; it simply doesn’t display. (See Chapter 4 to
change the display appearance, column width, and
alignment of your data.)
If a value displays as scientific notation or number signs such as in
Figure 2-4, it means the value is too long to fit into the cell. You
need to widen the column width. 
• Date: If you enter a date, such 12/3, Dec 3, or 3 Dec,
Excel automatically returns 03-Dec in the cell,
but the formula bar displays 12/03/2005.
See Chapter 4 to change the date appearance.

Enter Data

Undo Data Entry
1.
Enter text into a spreadsheet.
2.
To undo any actions or correct any mistakes you make
when entering data, do one of the following:
• Choose Edit➪Undo.
• Press Ctrl+Z.
• Click the Undo icon on the toolbar.
3.
Keep repeating your favorite undo method until you’re
back where you want to be.
4.
To undo several steps at once, click the arrow on the
Undo icon and select the step you want to undo from.
(See Figure 2-5.)
You can’t undo some actions and Excel indicates this by changing

Building Formulas
T
his chapter is all about the math. With Excel, you can create formulas to
perform calculations. The calculations can be simple such as adding 2
plus 2 or they can be extremely complex such as those used to calculate
depreciation. But don’t despair; you don’t have to do most of the work.
Excel includes over 230 built-in calculations in nine different categories,
which are called functions.
Functions contain arguments, which appear in parentheses following the func-
tion’s name. The arguments are the details you provide to Excel indicating
which numbers to calculate in the function. Some functions require several
arguments to function correctly but again, don’t worry; Excel contains a
Function Wizard to walk you through the entire process.
The primary tasks in this chapter include
➟
Creating simple and complex formulas by typing them into a cell.
➟
Analyzing data with Excel’s timesaving functions.
➟
Creating cell ranges separated with a colon for a sequential cell 
selection or by a comma to list specific cell locations.
➟
Evaluating formula errors and locate a cell’s precedents and 
dependents.

Create Simple Formulas 
with Operators
1.
Enter values in two different cells; however, formulas do
not need to reference a cell address. They can contain an
actual number.
2.
In the cell that you want the calculation of the two val-
ues, type an equal sign (=). All formulas begin with an
equal sign. 
3.
Type the first cell address or type the first value you want
to include in the formula. In the example in Figure 3-1,
I’m adding two cell references (B5 and B6) together.
4.
Using the keys on the main part of your keyboard or
from the numeric keypad, type an operator. Operators
include the following:
• The plus sign (+) to add
• The minus sign (–) to subtract
• The asterisk (*) to multiply
• The slash (/) to divide
5.
Type the second cell address or the second value you
want to include in the formula. 
6.
Press Enter and Excel displays the results of the calcula-
tion in the selected cell. (See Figure 3-2.)
The formula bar at the top displays the actual formula.
Formulas can have multiple references. For example, you could
have a formula =B5+B6+B6+B8. Formulas with multiple operators
are called compound formulas.
Figure 3-1: All formulas begin with the equal sign
Figure 3-2: A simple formula
➟
22
Chapter 3: Building Formulas

Create Compound Formulas
1.
Type values in three or more different cells.
2.
Select the cell where you want the formula.
3.
Type the equal sign and then the first cell reference.
4.
Type the first operator and then the second cell reference.
5.
Type the second operator and then the third cell reference. 
Compound formulas are not limited to three references. They can
contain many different cell references and you can use cell refer-
ences multiple times in a compound formula. 
6.
Press Enter. Excel displays the results of the calculation
in the selected cell. The actual formula appears in the
formula bar as shown in Figure 3-3.
If you were paying attention in your high school algebra class, you
may remember the Rule of Priorities. In a compound formula, Excel
calculates multiplication and division before it calculates addition
and subtraction. This means that you must include parentheses for
any portion of a formula you want calculated first. As an example,
in Figure 3-4, you see where the formula 3+5*2 gives a result
of 13, but (3+5)*2 gives a result of 16.
You can include range names in formulas such as =D23*
CommissionRate where a specific cell was named
CommissionRate. See Chapter 2 about using range
names.
Compound formulas can have multiple combinations in parentheses
and can contain any combination of operators and references. A for-
mula might read ((B5+C5)/2)*SalesTax, which
would add B5 and C5, divide that result by 2 and then multiply
that result times the value in the cell named SalesTax. 
Figure 3-3: A compound formula

Create Compound Formulas

Add Numbers with AutoSum
1.
Click the cell beneath a sequential list of values.
2.
Click the AutoSum (Σ) button on the toolbar. Excel
places a marquee (marching ants) around the cells
directly above the current cell. (See Figure 3-5.)
If the cells directly above the current cell have no values, Excel
selects the cells directly to the left of the current cell. If you want to
add a group of different cells, highlight the desired cells.
3.
Press the Enter key to display the sum. 
The formula bar displays the actual formula that begins with the equal
sign and the word SUM. The selected cells are shown in parenthe-
ses and the beginning and ending cells are separated by a colon. 
Find an Average Value
1.
After selecting the cell beneath a sequential list of values,
click the arrow next to the AutoSum button. Besides the
Sum operation, Excel displays a list of other calculation
options as shown in Figure 3-6:
• Average: Calculated by adding a group of numbers
and then dividing by the count of those numbers.
• Count: Counts the number of cells in a specified
range that contains numbers.
• Max: Determines the highest value in a specified range.
• Min: Determines the lowest value in a specified range.
2.
Choose Average and then press Enter to select the mar-
quee. The selected cell displays the average value.

Chapter 3: Building Formulas

Copy Formulas with AutoFill
1.
On a cell with a formula, position the mouse on the
AutoFill box in the lower-right corner. Make sure the
mouse pointer turns into a black cross.
2.
Drag the AutoFill box to include the cells you want to
copy the formula to and then release the mouse button.
(See Figure 3-7.) The AutoFill method of copying formu-
las is helpful if you’re copying a formula to surrounding
cells.
When you copy a formula, the formula actually changes because a
copied formula is relative to the position of the original formula.
For example, if the formula in cell D23 is B23+C23 and you
copy the formula to the next cell down, to cell D24, Excel automat-
ically changes the formula to B24+C24. If you do not want
the formula to change when copied, you must make the originating
formula an absolute formula (see the “Define an Absolute
Formula” section coming up).
Edit a Formula
1.
Double-click the cell containing the formula you want
to edit (or press F2). The cell expands to show the for-
mula instead of the result. (See Figure 3-8.)
2.
Use the arrow keys to navigate to the character you want
to change.
3.
Delete any unwanted characters by pressing the Backspace
key and type any additional characters you want to add. 
Press the Delete key to delete the entire formula and start over.
4.
Press the Enter key.

Edit a Formula

Define an Absolute Formula 
1.
To prevent a formula from changing a cell reference as
you copy it to a different location, you need to lock in
an absolute cell reference by following one of these
methods: 
• Lock in a cell location: Type a dollar sign in front
of both the column reference and the row reference
(for example $B$2). If the original formula in cell F5
is =E5*$B$2, and you copy the formula to cell F6,
the copied formula would read =E6*$B$2 instead 
of =E6*B3, which is what it would read without the
absolute reference. (See Figure 3-9.)
• Lock in a row or column location only: Type a dol-
lar sign in front of the column reference ($B2) or in
front of the row reference (B$2).
2.
Copy the formula as needed to other locations. Notice
that the absolute cell reference in the original formula
remains unchanged in the copied formulas. 
Copy Values Using Paste Special
1.
Select a cell (or group of cells) containing a formula and
then choose Edit➪Copy. A marquee appears around the
selected cell.
2.
Select the cell where you want the answer; then choose
Edit➪Paste Special. The Paste Special dialog box, shown
in Figure 3-10, appears.
3.
Select the Values option.
4.
Click OK. Excel pastes the result of the formula, not the
actual formula. If the original formula changes, this
value doesn’t change.

Build a Formula with the Function
Wizard
1.
Select the cell where you want to enter a function; then
choose Insert➪Function. The Insert Function dialog box
appears.
2.
Select a function category from the Or Select a Category
drop-down list. (See Figure 3-11.) 
To make the functions easier to locate, Excel separates them into
categories including Financial, Date, Math & Trig, Statistical, Lookup
and Ref, Database, Text, Logical, and Information. For example,
the Sum function is in the Math category, while Average, Count,
Max, and Min are Statistical functions. Functions that calculate a
payment value are considered Financial functions.
3.
Select a function name from the Select a Function list.
A brief description of the function and its arguments
appear under the list of function names. 
4.
Click OK. The Function Arguments dialog box displays.
The Function Arguments dialog box you see depends on
the function you select. Figure 3-12 shows the PMT func-
tion that calculates a loan payment based upon constant
payments and interest.
5.
Type the first argument amount or cell reference or click
the cell in the worksheet. If you click the cell, Excel places
a marquee around the selected cell.
6.
Press Tab to move to the next argument.
7.
Type or select the second argument. 
8.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 for each necessary argument.
9.
Click OK. Excel calculates the result based on the 
arguments you specified.

Build a Formula with the Function Wizard

Generate an IF Statement Formula
1.
Select a cell where you want the formula result.
2.
Type the equal sign and then the word IF.
You could also use the Function Wizard to help create an IF state-
ment. Excel considers IF statements a logical function that contains
three arguments. The first argument determines whether a speci-
fied condition is met. If the condition is met (or TRUE), then the
function returns the value specified in the second argument; if the
condition is not met (or FALSE), then it returns the values spec-
ified in the third argument.
3.
Type an open parenthesis (.
4.
Begin the first argument by referencing the cell you want
to check. For example, if you want to check that cell B10
is greater than 100, type B10.
5.
Type an operator such as equal to (=), greater than ( >),
or less than (<) and then the value you want to compare.
6.
Type a comma to begin the second argument.
7.
Type what you want Excel to do if the first argument
is true. If you want Excel to display a value or cell
value, type the value or cell reference, but if you want
Excel to display text, enclose the text in quotation marks.
(See Figure 3-13.)
8.
Type a comma to begin the third and final argument.
9.
Type what you want Excel to do if the first argument is
not true.
10.
Press Enter. Excel displays the results of the analysis in
the selected cell. In Figure 3-14, you see the result of No
in cell B8 because the payment amount was not less
than the limit.

Troubleshoot Formula Errors
1.
Select the cell with an error message. A Smart Tag, like
the one in Figure 3-15, appears.
2.
Click the Smart Tag. A list of options appears. See
Chapter 15 for more information on Smart Tags.
3.
Depending on the error type, edit the formula as needed:
• DIV/0!: Divide by zero error. This error means the
formula is trying to divide by either an empty cell or
one with a value of zero. Make sure all cells referenced
in the division have a value other than zero in them. 
• #VALUE!: This error means the formula is referencing
an invalid cell address. An example might be if text is
in a cell and the formula is expecting a value. You
may also see this error if you delete a value in a cell
that was used in a formula. Locate and correct the
invalid cell reference.
• NAME#: This error occurs when Excel doesn’t recog-
nize text in a formula, perhaps from a misspelling of
a range name. Make sure the text name actually exists
and is spelled correctly. Also verify the spelling of the
function name to make sure it is accurate. 
• Circular: This means that the formula in a cell is
referring to itself. Locate the circular reference and edit
the formula so it does not include itself. Figure 3-16
shows a circular reference.
To help determine the nature of the problem or where the problem
originates, click the drop-down arrow on the Smart button and click
Show Calculation. Steps display the logic behind the formula.

Formatting Cells 
and Data
W
hoever said “Looks aren’t everything” didn’t stare at an unformatted
Excel spreadsheet. Columns often aren’t wide enough, fonts are too
small to read, dates display in an unusual manner, and when you have
columns of data stacked next to each other, sometimes the information
begins to overlap.
Fortunately, Excel includes a plethora of features to make your data look
more presentable and easier to read. Here are some of the Excel formatting
features you’ll discover in this chapter:
➟
The ability to change the font type, size and style of text, values,
or dates.
➟
Change the alignment of data in a cell from the standard left aligned
for text and right aligned for values or dates.
➟
Create titles using the Excel Merge and Center button.
➟
Change column width and row heights.
➟

2.
On the Formatting toolbar, click the Currency Style,
Percent Style, or Comma Style button. Figure 4-2 shows
values in column B, C, and D in Comma Style; column
E is in Currency Style; and column F is in Percent Style.
Cells displaying ###### indicate the cell is not wide enough to display
the complete number. Widening the column displays the number.
3.
To remove digits to the right of the decimal point, click
the Decrease Decimal button on the Formatting toolbar.
Each click removes the number to the far right of the
decimal point. Click enough times and the decimal
point disappears.

Click the Increase Indent button on the Formatting tool-
bar. Notice in cells A6 through A9 and A13 through A18
of Figure 4-3 that each Increase Indent click adds a
small amount of space between the cell border and the
data itself. How Excel indents depends on how you for-
mat the cell:
• If the data is left aligned: Excel indents to the left.
• If the data is right aligned: Excel indents to the right.
• If the data is centered: With the first click, Excel
indents to the right, but subsequent clicks cause
Excel to move the data to the left. 
Click the Decrease Indentation button to remove indentation.

Adjust Column Width
1.
Highlight the columns you want to change.
2.
Choose a method to adjust column width:
• To manually change the width of one column, posi-
tion the mouse on the right boundary of the column
heading until the mouse turns into a black bar with
arrowheads pointing right and left. Drag the boundary
bar left or right until the column is the width that
you want. In Figure 4-9, I’ve expanded column A.
• To set column width to a specific setting, click any-
where in the column you want to modify, and then
choose Format➪Column➪Width. The Column
Width dialog box, shown in Figure 4-10, appears.
Type the exact width you want; then click OK.
Excel displays cell width in characters and pixels instead of in
inches.
• To automatically change the width of the column so
it fits the widest entry in the column, double-click
the boundary on the right side of the column head-
ing or select the columns; then choose Format➪
Column➪AutoFit Selection.
The default column width is 8.43. To change the default column width
on the current worksheet, choose Format➪Column➪Standard
Width. Enter the new width; then click OK. All columns, not already
manually changed, change to the standard width you specified.

Change Row Height
1.
Highlight the rows you want to change.
Optionally, select the rows and choose Format➪Row➪AutoFit. 
2.
Choose a method to adjust row height:
• To manually change the height of a single row, position
the mouse on the boundary under the row heading
until the mouse turns into a black bar with arrowheads
pointing up and down. Drag the boundary bar until
the row is the height that you want. In Figure 4-11,
I expanded row 10. 
Row height is measured in points and depends on the font you are
using. The default font of Arial 10 point, uses a default row height
of 12.75, but Excel automatically adjusts the row height when you
select a font larger than the cell height.
• To set row height to a specific setting, click anywhere
in the row you want to modify or highlight the desired
rows; then choose Format➪Row➪Height. The Row
Height dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-12.
Type the exact height you want; click OK. The row
changes to the height you specified. 
• To automatically change the height of the row so it
fits the tallest entry in the row, double-click the
boundary on the bottom of the row heading. 
The square to the left of column A and above row 1 is called the Select
All square. To change the row height for all rows in the worksheet,
click the Select All square and follow the steps to change all rows.

Adding Color and
Graphics 
S
ometimes, even after adding font and style attributes to cell data, you still
need to call extra attention to specific areas. How about adding a little
color to the cell data? Or instead of modifying just the data in the cell, how
about making alterations such as adding a background color or a border?
And if that’s still not enough, you can draw an arrow to point to a specific
area. What? You can’t draw a straight line? That’s not a problem because
with Excel, you don’t have to be a gifted artist to draw. Whether you want
to draw circles, squares, lines, or arrows, Excel provides tools to assist you,
making the drawing process fun and easy. 
In this chapter, you discover how to
➟
Add color or lines to text or cells, bringing contrast to particular por-
tions of your worksheet.
➟
Use Excel’s conditional formatting feature. With this function, you can
have Excel do the legwork for you when searching for specific criteria
and flag you by applying special formatting to the cells containing the
criteria you’re looking for.
➟
Draw arrows, shapes, and annotation boxes, all of which you can add
depth to with shading and dimension.
➟
Insert clip art, which is a collection of ready-made computerized graphic
illustrations, or your company logo and your viewers will sit up and
take notice of your worksheet.

Working with
Workbooks
A
llow me to begin by clearing up a couple of terms. There are worksheets
(sometimes called spreadsheets), which are a single collection of cells
with up to 65,536 rows down and 256 columns across. Therefore, each
worksheet can contain up to 16,777,216 cells of data. 
Secondly, there are workbooks, which are a collection of worksheets. By default,
each time you create a new Excel workbook, it contains three worksheets.
Each workbook however, can have up to 256 worksheets. The resulting possi-
ble number of cells in a single workbook is too huge (over 4 billion!) to even
think about, but the fact remains you could create a single huge workbook.
Realistically though, you’ll probably have a number of different workbooks,
each with a number of worksheets. 
This chapter is primarily about working with multiple sheets. You discover
how to insert, delete, move, and copy worksheets, move among the sheets,
rename the tabs that reference them, and create formulas that reference
other worksheets or workbooks.
It’s also about protection. Throughout this chapter, you find out about secu-
rity protection in the form of hiding rows, columns, single worksheets, or
even entire workbooks. Discover how to lock a sheet so you or others don’t
accidentally overwrite critical formulas or other data. I even show you how
to protect a workbook with a password so others cannot see it or modify it.
Finally, I show you how to create hyperlinks to Web sites, other cells or
workbooks, or create an instant e-mail.

Generate a Reference to 
Another Worksheet
1.
Click the cell in which you want to create a reference.
2.
To display a value located in a cell on a different work-
sheet, but in the same workbook, type the equal sign (=). 
3.
Click the worksheet tab containing the cell you want
to reference and then click the actual cell you want to
reference. 
4.
Press the Enter key. In the current cell, Excel displays the
equal sign, the worksheet name, an exclamation point,
and the cell reference. (See Figure 6-15.)
To display a value located in another cell on the same worksheet,
type the equal sign and then the cell address; for example: =B45.
If the value in B45 changes, the cell with the reference to B45
changes also.
Include a Reference in a Formula
1.
To include in a formula a cell located on a different
worksheet but in the same workbook, begin the formula. 
2.
Click the worksheet containing the cell where you
want to position the distant cell reference; then click
the actual cell. 
3.
Finish the remainder of the formula. Figure 6-16 illus-
trates an example of a formula using a reference to a 
different worksheet.
Formulas referencing other worksheets or other workbooks can
also be compound formulas or used in a function.

Cross-Reference Other Workbooks
1.
Open the workbook to which you want to refer (for
example, Workbook2).
2.
Click the desired cell in the workbook you want to cre-
ate a reference (for example, Workbook1).
3.
In Workbook1, begin the formula or reference with an
equal sign (=).
4.
If using a function or formula, enter any portion that
you want to precede the cross reference.
5.
Click the cell that you want to reference from Workbook2.
6.
Finish any remainder to the formula or press the Enter
key. Excel displays the following: the equal sign, an
apostrophe, the Workbook2 filename in brackets, the
worksheet name, a closing apostrophe, an exclamation
point, and the cell reference. For example, [Sales.
xls]January’!$E$10 refers to the value in cell E10
of the sheet January in the Excel file named Sales. See
Figure 6-17 for an example of a cross reference.
Excel uses absolute references (with dollar signs) when referring
to other workbooks.
7.
Open the workbook that contains the cross-reference.
Excel display the dialog box shown in Figure 6-18,
prompting you to update the cross-referenced cell. 
8.
Click Update if you want Excel to check the originating
workbook for changes to the referenced cell, or click the
Don’t Update button to leave the cell reference with the
last saved contents.

1.
Select a cell or graphic object; then choose Insert➪
Hyperlink. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box, shown in
Figure 6-19, appears.
2.
Select an option depending on what you want to link to:
• Another file: Locate and select the filename. When
the user clicks the link, the referenced file opens.
• A Web site: Enter the Web address in the Address text
box. When the user clicks the link, the browser opens
to the referenced Web page.
• A different cell in the current workbook: Click the
Place in This Document button, and then specify
which worksheet and cell location you want to refer-
ence. When users click this link, they’re redirected to
the specified cell address. 
• An e-mail: Click the E-mail Address button, and
then enter the recipient’s e-mail address and a sub-
ject. When the user clicks the link, the user’s e-mail
program starts (see Figure 6-20).
3.
Click OK. 
To remove a hyperlink, right-click the link and choose Remove
Hyperlink. The text that was entered for the hyperlink remains in
the cell.
Another method to add a hyperlink is with the Excel Hyperlink func-
tion. In the cell where you want the link, type =HYPERLINK
(“FullPathName”,”TextToDisplay”). For example, if you type
in cell B3 =HYPERLINK(“C:\practice.xls”,”Click here to open
the practice file”),  cell B3 displays Click here to
open the practice file, and when you click
the link, it opens a worksheet named PRACTICE.XLS. Be

S
omeone once wrote about the importance of seeing and being seen.
While I’m sure that quote referred to people, it also can apply to
your Excel worksheets. You need to see them in many different contexts.
That’s what this chapter is about — seeing your workbook from different
perspectives:
➟
Viewing alternatives such as zooming in or out, or seeing the work-
sheet without toolbars and other screen elements.
➟
Splitting your screen to see multiple sections of a worksheet at the
same time or viewing multiple worksheets together.
➟
Freezing portions of a worksheet so you can see category or row 
headings. 
➟
Adding non-printing comments, which are similar to sticky notes for
individual cells.
➟
Quickly and temporarily hiding open workbooks — perhaps to pro-
tect them from prying eyes.
➟
Creating templates that can bring consistency, such as the company
standards or personal preferences, to your workbooks.
➟
Options that change the way you view the Excel workbook. For example,
see the actual formulas instead of viewing only the formula results. 
Go ahead, take a look!

Zoom In or Out
1.
Choose View➪Zoom. The Zoom dialog box appears,
shown in Figure 7-1.
Optionally, click the Zoom drop-down list on the Standard toolbar.
2.
Select a magnification percentage. A higher zoom setting
makes the text appear larger so you see less on-screen; a
lower zoom setting shows more on-screen, but the data
appears smaller. Zooming does not affect the printed
data size.
You can select the Custom option and enter your own magnifica-
tion percentage. Zoom values are from 10 to 400.
3.
Click OK.
Split the Excel Screen
1.
Click anywhere in a row and column where you want to
split your screen. 
2.
Choose Window➪Split. Excel splits the window hori-
zontally into two or four panes each separated from
other panes, by bars. Each pane has its own set of scroll
bars (see Figure 7-2).
3.
Drag the horizontal split bar up or down or the vertical
split bar left or right to resize the window sections.
Choose Window➪Unsplit to remove the split or double-click any
part of the bars that divide the panes.

1.
Choose what you want to freeze:
• Columns: Select the column to the right of the
columns you want to freeze. For example, click
cell B1 to freeze only column A.
• Rows: Select the row below the rows you want to
freeze. For example, click cell A4 to freeze rows 
1, 2, and 3.
• Columns and rows: Click the cell below the rows
and to the right of the columns you want to freeze.
For example, click cell B5 to freeze both column A
and rows 1 through 4 (as shown in Figure 7-3).
2.
Choose Window➪Freeze Panes. A thin black line appears
to separate the sections. As you see in Figure 7-4, as
you scroll down and to the left, rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 and
column A remain visible even though you see rows 7
through 27 in the bottom section and columns H
through P on the right.
Normally, when you press the Home key, Excel takes you to cell A1.
However, when Freeze Panes is active, pressing the Home key takes
you to the cell just below and to the left of the column headings. 
3.
Choose Window➪Unfreeze panes to remove the freeze
from row and column headings.

Sorting Data
S
ometimes worksheets become quite large, which makes it time-consuming
and difficult to locate particular pieces of information. If your data is in
an array, you may find the data easier to view if it is sorted in a particular
manner. 
Perhaps you have multiple worksheets and you want to locate every occurrence
of a specific value. Or, maybe you’re just a neat freak and want everything to
be in a particular order. Excel contains features to help keep your worksheets
in an easy-to-manage sequence.
Here’s what you can expect in this chapter:
➟
Sort your data in ascending or descending order using either the tool-
bar or the Excel Sort dialog box.
➟
Perform a secondary sort if the primary sort has multiple matches.
➟
Sort data containing days of the week or month names.
➟
Create a customized list of frequently used names or terms.
➟
Locate cells containing data you specify, whether the data is part of a
formula or a resulting cell value.
➟
Quickly replace data containing certain information with another
specified set of data.
➟
Locate all cells with a particular style of formatting and easily replace
them with a different format.

Use the Toolbar to Sort
1.
Create a list in contiguous order with headings specify-
ing the contents of each column. Figure 8-1 illustrates
an ideal data array.
2.
Click any cell containing data in the column by which
you want to sort. 
If the data is in a connected list, you do not have to select it first. If
the data is not in an adjoining list, you must first select the entire
list. If unselected data is in columns next to the selected data, Excel
may prompt you for more information.
3.
Click the Sort Ascending button. Excel sorts the entire
list in ascending order. Text is sorted A–Z; numbers are
sorted 1–10; and dates are sorted earliest to last.
Excel sorts in the following pattern: numbers, spaces, special char-
acters (which are ! “ # $ % & ( ) * , . / : ; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
+ < = >) and finally, alphabetic letters. 
4.
Click the Sort Descending button. Excel sorts the entire list
by descending order, as shown in Figure 8-2. Text is
sorted Z–A; numbers are sorted 10–1; and dates are
sorted last to earliest.
If you do not see two sorting buttons (Ascending and Descending),
choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize and select the Show Standard
and Formatting Toolbars on Two Rows option. Click the Close button
and you can see both the Ascending and Descending Sort buttons.
If Excel incorrectly sorts a cell that contains a value, make sure the
cell is formatted as a number and not as text.

Work with the Sort Command
1.
Select or click in the list of data you want to sort. Select
only a single column of data if you want to sort that
column independently of the rest of the data.
2.
Choose Data➪Sort. The Sort dialog box opens
(see Figure 8-3).
3.
If your data includes column headings, select the
Header Row option in the My Data Range Has section.
If it doesn’t include column headings, select the No
Header Row option. Excel does not include header rows
in the sort process.
4.
From the Sort By drop-down list, select the column by
which you want to sort (see Figure 8-4).
If you do not have header rows, Excel displays Column A, Column B,
and so forth.
5.
Select whether you want to sort the data in ascending or
descending order.
Click the Options button if you want to make the sorting case sen-
sitive (noncapitalized words before capitals). This option is not
available in PivotTable reports (see Chapter 13).
6.
Click OK. Excel sorts data in the following order: num-
bers, special characters, and finally alphabetic characters.
Blanks are always placed last.
When sorting an outline, Excel sorts only the highest-level groups.
This keeps the detail rows or columns together, even if hidden. (See
Chapter 11.)

Sort by Multiple Criteria
1.
Select or click in the list of data you want to sort.
Choose Data➪Sort.
2.
If your data includes column description headings,
select the Header Row option in the My Data Range
Has section.
Although the most common sort is to sort by rows, you can also sort
by columns. In the Sort dialog box, click the Options button,  choose
Sort Left to Right in the Orientation section, and then click OK. 
3.
From the Sort By drop-down list, select the first column
by which you want to sort. Choose whether to sort the
first criteria in ascending or descending order. 
Excel sorts dates formatted with slashes such as 11/22/68 as
numeric data. Dates with the day or month spelled out must be
sorted differently. See the later section, “Sort by Day, Month, or
Custom List.”
4.
Click the Then By down arrow and select the column
you want to sort by if two or more items are identical in
the first Sort By option. See Figure 8-5.
5.
Choose whether to sort the second criteria in ascending
or descending order.
6.
(Optional) Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for a third criterion.
7.
Click OK. Excel performs the sort process. Figure 8-6
illustrates data rows sorted first by Artist, and then by
Song Title.
During an Excel sort, apostrophes (‘) and hyphens (-) are ignored,
unless two text strings are the same except for a hyphen. In that
situation, the text with the hyphen is sorted as the latter.

Create a Customized List
1.
Choose Tools➪Options. The Options dialog box appears.
2.
Click the Custom Lists tab. Excel provides two ways to
create a custom list:
A custom list can contain text or text mixed with numbers. Use cus-
tom lists to speed up data entry for commonly used terms such as
salespeople, regions, or products.
• To create a list from items you already have entered
into the worksheet, click the worksheet icon next to
the Import button. The Options dialog box collapses.
Highlight the worksheet cells containing your list;
then press Enter. The Options dialog box reappears.
Click the Import button. The data you selected appears
in both the List Entries box and the Custom Lists box
(see Figure 8-7).
• To type your own list, without entering it into the
worksheet first, select New List from the Custom Lists
section. Type your list in the List Entries text box
(see Figure 8-8) separating each list item with a
comma, and then click the Add button.
3.
Click OK.
You can now use the AutoFill feature with the custom list by typing
one list entry and using AutoFill to enter the other list entries. See
Chapter 2.
To edit a custom list, choose Tools➪Options. From the Custom Lists
tab, select the list that you want to edit. Make any desired changes
in the List Entries box, and then click Add. To delete a customized

Create a Customized List

Sort by Day, Month, or Custom List
1.
Select or click in the list of data you want to sort. Choose
Data➪Sort. The Sort dialog box appears.
Excel sorts numbers first, and then text. If your data includes values des-
ignated as text, Excel prompts you before the Sort dialog box appears
how you want these cells handled. You can choose to keep the numbers
as text values, or sort them as numbers. If you sort them as numbers,
both numbers stored as text and actual numbers are sorted together.
2.
If your data includes column description headings, click
the Header Row option in the My Data Range Has section.
3.
Specify the order in which you want the data sorted and
whether to sort in ascending or descending order (see
Figure 8-9).
If you’re sorting on days of the week or months of the year, the data
must be spelled out completely (for example, September or
Tuesday), or abbreviated to the first three characters only (for
example, Sep or Tue).
By default, Excel sorts days and months alphabetically instead of by
date. To sort days or months by date, or to sort a custom list, the day,
month, or list column must be the first sort criteria. 
4.
Click the Options button. The Sort Options dialog box
opens.
Unless you specify otherwise, Excel sorts customized lists alphabeti-
cally instead of list order.
5.
Select a sort order from the available list. (See Figure 8-10.)

Creating Charts 
with Excel
W
hoever said a picture is worth a thousand words is most certainly
referring to a chart. Let’s face it . . . we like looking at pictures more
than we like looking at sheets of data. Charts, sometimes referred to as
graphs, provide an effective way to illustrate your worksheet data by making
the relationship between numbers easier to see because it turns numbers
into shapes, and then the shapes can be compared to each other.
If you’ve ever spent hours drawing a chart on graph paper, you’ll really
appreciate the ease with which you can create dozens of different chart styles
using your Excel data and you don’t really have to draw a thing! With just a
few decisions on your part, and a few clicks of the mouse, you have a two-
or three-dimensional illustration of your data.
Charts let you get across your thoughts with simplicity and strength and
because different charts draw you to different conclusions, they prod you
to ask different questions about what you are seeing. Whatever the idea you
are trying to convey, charts make it easier.

Create a Basic Chart
1.
Select the data (sequential or nonsequential) you want
to plot in the chart. See Figure 9-1 for an example of
sequential data selected for a chart.
2.
Press the F11 key. Excel immediately adds a new sheet
called Chart1 to your workbook with the data plotted
into a column chart. Each subsequent chart page is num-
bered sequentially such as Chart2, Chart3, and so forth.
Looking at Figure 9-2, you can see the various elements
that make up a chart:
Some newer keyboards use a different function for the F11 key. If
your F11 key does not produce a chart, use the Excel Chart Wizard
as explained in the next section.
Throughout this chapter you find out how to edit the look and style
of a chart, including creating a chart using the Excel Chart Wizard.
• Title: A descriptive name for the overall chart. By
default, titles are not added in a basic chart, but you
can add them later manually or by using the Chart
Wizard.
• X or Category axis: Column or row headings from
your selected data, which Excel uses for Category axis
names. In a column chart, the categories display along
the bottom. In other charts (such as a bar chart), the
category axis displays along the left side.
• Category label: A descriptive name for the Category
axis. By default, a category label is not added in a
basic chart, but you can add one later manually or
with the Chart Wizard.
Figure 9-1: Select data for a chart
Figure 9-2: Viewing chart basics
➟

Chapter 9: Creating Charts with Excel

• Y or Value axis: A scale representing the zero or the
lowest and highest numbers in the plotted data.
The Value axis is usually located on the left side on
a column chart or on the bottom on a bar chart.
• Value label: A descriptive name for the values. By
default, a value label is not added in a basic chart,
but you can add one later manually or by using the
Chart Wizard.
• Legend: The box, usually located on the right, identi-
fies the patterns or colors that are assigned to the chart
data series. Notice in Figure 9-3 how the legend
explains that the striped series represents January,
the checked series is for February, and the solid color
series is for March.
• Tick marks: The small extension of lines that appear
outside of the gray area and represent divisions of the
value or category axis.
• Gridlines: These lines extend from the tick marks
across the chart area, which allows you to easily view
and evaluate data.
• Series: Excel uses the worksheet cell values to generate
the series. Each element, called data markers, represents
a single worksheet cell value and related data markers
make up a data series and have the same pattern or
color. In Figure 9-4, you can see the comparison of
the data values to the y-axis and the series values.
• Plot area: The gray background that represents the
entire plotted chart area.
To delete this chart, right-click the Chart tab and choose Delete. When
Excel asks for a confirmation, click Delete again.
Use any of the drawing tools on the Drawing toolbar to annotate
your chart such as adding arrows, circles, or text boxes. See Chapter 5
for more info.

Work with the Chart Wizard
1.
Select the data you want to plot in the chart. If you are
selecting values such as monthly figures, you don’t want
to include totals in your chart.
2.
Choose Insert➪Chart or click the Chart Wizard button
on the Standard toolbar. The first screen of the Chart
Wizard appears. (See Figure 9-5.)
3.
Select the chart type you want to use (click a chart type
to see a sample and an explanation of the chart):
• Column: Column charts compare values to categories
using a series of vertical columns to illustrate the series.
• Bar: Bar charts, like column charts, compare values to
categories, but use a series of horizontal bars to illus-
trate the series.
• Line: Line charts are similar to bar charts but use dots
to represent the data points and lines to connect the
data points.
• Pie: This chart compares parts to a whole. Usually
a pie chart has only one data series (see Figure 9-6).
• Area: Area charts display the trend of each value, usu-
ally over a specified period of time.
• X-Y Scatter: These charts include two value axes,
showing one set of numerical data along the x-axis
and another along the y-axis.
• Surface: Shows trends in values in a continuous curve.
• Doughnut: Displays data similarly to a pie chart; it
compares parts to a whole, but contains multiple series.
• Radar: Displays changes in values relative to a center
point by comparing the cumulative values of multi-
ple data series.

Chapter 9: Creating Charts with Excel

• Stock: Stock charts (see Figure 9-7) illustrate the 
fluctuation of stock prices. In a stock chart, the data
order is very important and usually the row headings
are High, Low, and Close; or Open, High, Low, and
Close.
• Bubble: These charts are similar to scatter charts, but
compare three sets of values by displaying a series of
circles.
• Cylinder, Cone, and Pyramid: These three charts cre-
ate a column or bar chart using 3-dimensional shapes.
4.
Choose a chart subtype. Depending on the chart type,
some chart subtypes show the data series next to each
other, others show the data stacked on top of each other.
Additionally, some charts are 2-dimensional and others
are 3-dimensional. 
If you are not sure which chart subtype is best for your data, click
the Press and Hold to View Sample button to see your selected data
in any chart style and subtype.

Printing Workbooks
W
hen you finish compiling your worksheet, you’ll probably want to
print a hard copy or e-mail a copy to someone else. This chapter
shows you a number of Excel tools you can use to improve your document
layout, including headers, footers, page orientation, and margins.
Also, before you print or give your Excel file to someone else, you should
check it for spelling errors because typos can stand out screaming “I can’t
spell.” Excel includes a built-in dictionary you can use to check your work-
books for misspellings; however, it can’t read your mind, so if you type
too instead of two, Excel probably won’t indicate that as an error. But, com-
bine the spell check with proofreading on your part, and you’ll find a very
helpful tool.
When printing, Excel assumes you want to print the entire worksheet area
unless you specify otherwise. You discover how to specify exactly what you
want to print. This chapter also includes these topics:
• Working with page breaks
• Adjusting the paper size
• Making your worksheet fit better on a page for those times when
you want to get that last few rows or columns on a single page
• Printing gridlines or row and column headings on the page as well
as other print options that you might want to select when printing
your worksheet or chart

Spell Check
1.
Choose Tools➪Spelling or click the Spelling icon on the
Standard toolbar. The Spelling dialog box opens and
Excel highlights the cell with the first potential mis-
spelling along with suggested changes (as shown in
Figure 10-1).
Optionally, press F7 to start the spell check.
Spell check reviews all cell values, comments, embedded charts,
text boxes, buttons, and headers and footers, but it does not check
protected worksheets, formulas, or text that results from a formula.
2.
Select one of the following options:
• Change or Change All: Choose one of the sugges-
tions; then click Change to change just this incident
of the spelling mistake or Change All if you think
you could have made the mistake more than once.
• AutoCorrect: Have Excel, in future workbooks, 
automatically correct the mistake with the selected
replacement. 
• Ignore Once: Click this button if you don’t want to
change the highlighted instance of the spelling.
• Ignore All: Click this button if you don’t want to
change any instances of the spelling.
• Add to Dictionary: Add a word to Excel’s built-in
dictionary so that Excel won’t flag it as a potential
error in the future.
3.
After you select an option, Excel proceeds to the next
error, and when all potential mistakes are identified,
click OK (as shown in Figure 10-2).

Working with
Outlines
You can use Excel to automatically calculate subtotal and grand total 
values from rows containing related data (sometimes called a database).
When you create subtotals, Excel outlines the list so that you can display and
hide the detail rows for each subtotal.
Before you use the subtotal function, you must first sort your list so that
the rows you want to subtotal are grouped together. You can then calculate
subtotals and other mathematical calculations for any column that contains
numbers, or you can count the number of items in a selected field.
If your data is not in a database format, you can still group sections together,
allowing you a quick way to display or hide the sections as needed. Similar
to using subtotals, Excel displays groups in an outline format. In this chapter,
I take a look at the extensive subtotaling, grouping, and outlining features
contained in Excel.

Generate a Subtotal
1.
Sort the field by which you want to generate subtotals.
The subtotal data must have no blank rows or columns, and each
column in the database must have a label in the first row.
2.
Choose Data➪Subtotals. The Subtotal dialog box
appears.
3.
Select the field you want to subtotal from the At Each
Change In drop-down list.
4.
Select a function from the Use Function drop-down list.
Choices include SUM (totals the values in a field), COUNT
(returns the quantity of items in a field), AVERAGE
(determines the average value of a field), MAX and MIN
(display the highest and lowest value in a field), and
PRODUCT (returns the value of all the numbers in a field
multiplied together). 
5.
Select the fields you want to subtotal from the Add
Subtotal To drop-down list. (See Figure 11-1.) You
can select more than one field to subtotal.
6.
Check the Replace Current Subtotals box if you already
have a previous subtotal calculation. Excel replaces the
previous subtotals with the new one.
7.
Check the Page Break Between Groups box if you want
Excel to begin each subtotaled group on a new page.
8.
Remove the check from the Summary Below Data box if
you want Excel to place the subtotals at the top of each
group instead of under each group.
9.
Click OK. Excel performs the subtotal. Figure 11-2
shows sales subtotaled by Sales Rep.

Collapse Subtotal Headings
1.
Create subtotals of your data. (See the preceding
“Generate a Subtotal” section.)
With subtotals, Excel defines groups in the form of an outline and
bases the groups on the rows used to calculate the subtotals.
2.
Hide and show data as you need with the following
methods (see Figure 11-3):
• See only the grand total. Click the 1 on the subtotal
headings.
• See the subtotal categories and amounts (the detail
is hidden). Click the 2 on the subtotal headings
(the column on the left side of the worksheet). 
• Show all the detail and subtotals: Click the 3 on the
subtotal headings. Excel displays the individual work-
sheet rows.

Create subtotals for your data (see the “Generate a
Subtotal” section, earlier in this chapter).
2.
Click the Hide Detail button (minus sign) next to any
subtotal row. As seen in Figure 11-4, the selected subto-
tal detail collapses. It’s not lost, only hidden.
3.
Click the Show Detail button (plus sign) next to any
subtotal row. The detail data for the selected row appears.
Optionally, choose Data➪Group and Outline➪Hide Detail or Show
Detail.

Control Individual Subtotals

Create Multiple Subtotals
1.
From the Sort dialog box, select the column by which
you want to generate primary subtotals and the column
by which you want to generate secondary subtotals.
For example, if you want to first subtotal sales by state
and then by city, you would also sort first by state and
then by city.
2.
Choose Data➪Subtotals to display the Subtotals
dialog box.
3.
Select the primary field you want to subtotal from the
At Each Change drop-down list. Figure 11-5 shows the
primary field as the State field.
4.
Select a function from the Use Function drop-down list.
5.
Select the fields you want to subtotal from the Add
Subtotal To drop-down list.
6.
Click OK. Excel summarizes the data by the selected field.
7.
Choose Data➪Sort. Excel again displays the Sort
dialog box.
8.
Select the secondary field you want to subtotal, the
type of function, and the fields you want to subtotal.
In my example, I use the City field.
9.
Deselect the Replace Current Subtotals box.
10.
Click OK. Figure 11-6 illustrates both the sales amount
and the sales tax subtotaled by state and then by city.
As you perform additional subtotaling, Excel adds additional levels.
In Figure 11-6, four heading levels are displayed. Level 1 displays
only the grand totals, level 2 displays the totals by state, level 3
shows the totals by city and state, and level 4 displays the detail.

1.
Choose Data➪Group and Outline➪AutoOutline.
Figure 11-9 illustrates a worksheet with outline head-
ings for both rows and columns. Row outline symbols
are on the left, and column outline symbols are at the
top of the worksheet.
AutoOutline works best if the worksheet has summary formulas
that reference cells in the detail cells. The summary formulas must
be adjacent to the detail.
AutoOutline assumes your summary rows are below the detail rows
or to the right of the detail columns. If your worksheet summary
rows are above or to the left of the detail, choose Data➪Group and
Outline➪Settings and uncheck the Summary Rows Below Detail
check box and/or the Summary Columns to Right of Detail option.
You can create and apply styles to an outline, or you can apply
AutoFormats to an outline. You can apply the formatting either
before or after you create the outline. See Chapter 4. To apply an
automatic style, choose Data➪Group and Outline➪Settings and
select the Automatic Styles check box.
2.
To expand the outline, click the Show Detail buttons to
the left of the rows or above the column headings. (See
Figure 11-10.)
3.
To collapse the outline, click the Hide buttons to the left
of the rows or above the column headings.
4.
To remove the AutoOutline, choose Data➪Group and
Outline➪Clear Outline.

ure 11-11, you see where all the vehicles in the asset
list are grouped together.
Click the Hide or Show Detail buttons to hide or display the group
detail.
3.
Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until you have created all the levels
you want in the outline.
Remove Items from a Group

the group. If you want to remove an entire group, select
all the rows or columns in the group.
2.
Choose Data➪Group and Outline➪Ungroup. Excel
removes the rows or columns from the group and if
the rows or columns you delete are in the middle of a
group, Excel breaks the group into two smaller groups.
See Figure 11-12, where the vehicles are broken from
one group into two smaller groups.
Optionally, ungroup sections by holding the Shift key, clicking the Hide
or Display buttons, and then choosing Data➪Group and Outline➪
Ungroup. Excel does not delete any data when you remove items
from a group.

Filtering Data
A
fter you create an Excel database and assemble a large amount of data,
you’ll probably want to analyze it. You may want to ask yourself questions
about your data such as “Who are my best customers?”, “Which inventory
items are provided by a specific supplier and cost less than a certain amount?”,
or “Which employees work the least amount of hours?” Excel includes sev-
eral tools you can use to study your data so you can make better decisions. 
This chapter is about filtering, where Excel pulls out specific records for
review, providing you an easy way to break your data into smaller more
manageable chunks. Filtering does not rearrange your data; it simply tem-
porarily hides records you don’t want to review, so you can clearly examine
those you do.
You can create your database by just typing in the Excel screen, or you can
use an Excel data entry screen. In the first section, you see how to create a
data entry screen for assistance in creating your database. But, remember,
you don’t have to use the data entry screen to use the filtering. 
The remainder of the chapter is devoted to the different ways you can filter
your data including
➟
Using AutoFilter, which allows you to select key pieces of data.
➟
Selecting records by more than one condition. 
➟
Displaying only the top x number of records.
➟
Multiple filtering where you locate records that either match all crite-
ria, or belong to one or the other criteria.
➟
Advanced filtering where you designate a specific area of your work-
sheet to manage your criteria selections.

Create a Data Entry Screen
1.
Enter the column headings for your database. When you
create the data entry screen, the column headings appear
as field names.
For faster data entry, format any numerical columns with the desired
number format. Then, when you use the data entry screen, you need
to enter only the raw numbers without commas or dollar signs.
2.
Click in any heading cell; then choose Data➪Form. 
3.
Click OK at the message box that appears. Excel displays
a data form with the headings shown as field names
(see Figure 12-1). Each label has a blank field to enter
the data.
If you already have data entered into your database, Excel does not
display the message box.
Using a data form makes data entry easier than typing across the
columns when you have a wide range with more columns than can
fit on the screen at one time.
4.
Enter the first record information, pressing the Tab key
to move from field to field (see Figure 12-2). 
Press Shift+Tab key to move back to the previous field. 
5.
Click the New button. Excel adds the record to the data-
base and displays another blank screen ready for the
next record.

Select a matching option:
• And: Your data must match both qualifications. In
Figure 12-11, the Sales values must be greater than
$50,000 and be less than $100,000. This allows the
sale of $61,833.51 (D32), but the sale of $2,988.12
(D4) and $175,086.38 (D34) would not be included.
• Or: Your data must match only one of the two quali-
fications. For example, if the first qualifier specifies the
sales value must be less than 50,000 or be greater than
100,000, then the sale of $2,988.12 in cell D4, and
the one of $175,086.38 in D34 would be included
in the filter, but the sale of $61,833.51 in D32 would
not be included.

Make sure the AutoFilter is turned off.
2.
Select the first four rows of the worksheet. 
3.
Choose Insert➪Rows, which inserts the blank rows at the
top of your worksheet. Excel uses these as your criteria
range. 
At least one blank row needs to separate your criteria range from
your actual database. By inserting four rows, you are creating the
opportunity to create three criteria options.
4.
Select the header row of your database. 
5.
Choose Edit➪Copy. A marquee appears.
6.
Click the first cell of the first blank row.
7.
Choose Edit➪Paste to copy the header row of your data-
base to the first blank row (Row 1). You now have a crite-
ria range ready to enter filter selections (see Figure 12-13).
While you could just retype the header row, using the copy and
paste feature protects you against typing errors. The criteria area
header row must exactly match the database header row.
8.
In the first blank row of the criteria range, enter the data
you want to match. For example, if you want to locate
any entries for the state of California, type California
under the State heading.
9.
Enter any additional filter criteria:
• Create an And filter: If you want Excel to find data that
meets more than one restriction, enter the desired addi-
tional criteria in another field on the first criteria row. 
• Create an Or filter: Enter the filter data on the sec-
ond row of the criteria range. See Figure 12-14 where
I’ve added data to both the State and Sales columns.

Chapter 12: Filtering Data

You can use Greater Than, Greater Than Or Equal To, Less Than, or
Less Than Or Equal To as operators in your criteria range. For exam-
ple, to find sales greater than or equal to 100, enter >=100 in the
Sales criteria row.
10.
Click any cell in the main part of the database.

14.
Enter the criteria range. Excel provides two different ways:
• Type the criteria range including the header row, but
not any blank rows. For example, in Figure 12-15, the
criteria range is A1: F2. 
Be sure to specify only the rows that contain filtering information.
If you include blank rows in your criteria range, Excel includes it in
the filtering with the effect of not filtering out any data, thereby
returning all records. 
• Click the Collapse button to the right of the Criteria
Range box and highlight the entire criteria range,
including the header row, but not any blank rows.
Press Enter to return to the Advanced Filter dialog box.
15.
Click OK. Excel places the results of your search in place
of your original database (as shown in Figure 12-16). 
You cannot place filtered data on a different sheet than the origi-

Creating Pivot Tables
M
any people don’t use PivotTables because they find them overwhelm-
ing. Yet, this powerful Excel tool helps you, within an instant, see your
spreadsheet data in a variety of different ways. PivotTable reports allow you
to group information, along with varying levels of detail, by different criteria,
such as date or category. They automatically create subtotals of your data on
a separate worksheet, which leaves your raw data untouched. 
However, PivotTable calculations aren’t limited to adding the numbers
together. You can use Count, Average, Maximum, Minimum, and a num-
ber of other statistical functions to help you view the overall picture of
your data.
You can fill any of the four main PivotTable areas with your data by a drag
of the mouse and you can display the data in a table format or in one of
Excel’s many chart formats.
In this chapter, you find out how you can, within a matter of seconds, gener-
ate and extract meaningful information from a large amount of data, thereby
saving you potentially dozens of hours of manual calculations.

Create a PivotTable 
1.
Organize your data in a list, while keeping these points
in mind: 
• Each column should contain only one type of data,
such as dates in one column and values in another
column.
• Make sure each column in the list has a heading label
directly above the data. (See Figure 13-1 for an exam-
ple.) PivotTables use the column headings as PivotTable
fields. 
• Do not leave any blank rows between the data and the
row headings and no blank columns within the data.
• Avoid blank cells within the data. If you have dupli-
cate data, use the Copy command to replicate it in
the blank cells.
• If you have more than one list on the same worksheet,
make sure at least one blank column and one blank
row separate them. Figure 13-2 illustrates a worksheet
with multiple data tables. Although you can create
multiple PivotTables in a workbook, you can use
only one table at a time when creating a PivotTable.
• Remove any Excel generated subtotals or grand totals
in the data by choosing Data➪Subtotals➪Remove All. 
• Plan your questions about how you want your data
analyzed. For example, if your data is sales informa-
tion, perhaps you want to know your sales totals by
region or a specific salesperson, or even deeper such
as by salesperson and by quarter. If your data is infor-
mation about your video collection, perhaps your
questions are how many DVDs you have with a cer-
tain actor as the star, or, how much you paid for all
the PG-13 rated movies?

2.
Click in any cell containing data. 
3.
Choose Data➪PivotTable and PivotChart Report. Step 1 of
the PivotTable and PivotChart Wizard appears. Excel needs
to know where your data will come from:
• Microsoft Excel List or Database: Creates the
PivotTable from organized data in a Microsoft Excel
worksheet. 
• External Data Source: Creates a PivotTable from data
stored in a non-Excel database. 
• Multiple Consolidation Ranges: Creates a PivotTable
from multiple Microsoft Excel worksheet ranges. 
• Another PivotTable Report or PivotChart Report:
Creates a PivotTable from another PivotTable
report in the same workbook.
4.
Click the Next button. Step 2 appears. 
5.
Verify that Excel correctly identified your data range,
including the headings. If not, specify the correct 
area in the Range box as you see in Figure 13-3.
6.
Click the Next button. Step 3 appears. 
7.
Select the New Worksheet option. 
You can use the existing worksheet option if you’re creating a
PivotChart. You must create PivotTables as a new sheet in the exist-
ing workbook.
8.
Click the Finish button. The PivotTable and PivotChart
Wizard closes and Excel creates a new worksheet with a
blank PivotTable, along with the PivotTable toolbar and
the PivotTable Field List, which contains each field from
your data range (see Figure 13-4). PivotTables contain
four primary elements:

• Data: Summarizes the numerical data.
• Page: Displays each section of data on its own page,
which allows you to display data for a single item. 
9.
From the PivotTable Field List, select the field you want
categorized.
10.
Select Row Area from the drop-down list at the bottom
of the PivotTable Field List. Excel displays each unique

tion, earlier in this chapter).
2.
To create a second summary level, drag the next field
you want to subtotal from the PivotTable Field List onto
another PivotTable area, keeping these pointers in mind:
• If you want to create a second category, such as by
Country, and then by Salesman, drag the field onto
the Row area. Figure 13-15 shows a PivotTable with
two categories. The field closest to the data is called
the inner row (in this example, Sales Rep). The other
field is called an outer row (in this example, Country).
Excel displays data in the inner row under each of the
outer row fields.
• If you want to total additional fields, drag the field
into the Data area.
• If you want to sum different fields, or if you want to
create two different total types (such as count and
sum, or max and min), select a field you have already
used. Currently used fields are listed in bold type. As
you see in Figure 13-16, the fields appear vertically in
the Data area.
You can add even more data fields to your PivotTable. PivotTable data
fields are only limited by the amount of memory in your computer. 
• If you want the data fields displayed horizontally,
drag the gray Data button onto the cell that has the
Total heading. Excel rearranges the data fields.

Building Simple
Macros
You can often save yourself time by automating tasks you perform fre-
quently. The automation takes the form of an Excel macro, which is a
series of commands and functions grouped together as a single command.
Macros are created in a special programming language called Visual Basic
and can be run whenever you need to perform the task. 
While you can write your own very complex macros in the Visual Basic pro-
gramming language, the easiest method for many macros is to use the Excel
Macro Recorder. When you record a macro, Excel stores information about
each step you take as you perform a series of commands. You then run the
macro to repeat, or play back, the commands.
The macro recorder is very literal and records every action you complete.
Therefore, planning your macro before you begin the recording process is
very important so you don’t record unnecessary steps. 
Security is an important issue when working with macros, because if you
open worksheets from other sources, the worksheets may contain macros
that are harmful to your computer. By default, Excel protects you from run-
ning macros, but if you’re creating your own macros, you’ll probably need
to change the security settings. 
In this chapter, you find out how to change your security settings, as well as
how to record, run, and delete Excel macros.

1.
Choose Tools➪Macro➪Security. The Security dialog box
shown in Figure 14-3 appears. 
2.
Set a security level:
• Very High: Allows you to only run macros that are
stored in a trusted location. The Trusted Publishers
tab lists all trusted locations.
• High: You can run only those macros that are digi-
tally signed. This is the default setting in Excel.
A digital signature is an electronic, encrypted, secure stamp of
authentication obtained from a commercial certification authority.
Excel’s Visual Basic programming language contains a self-certifying
digital signature tool, but because it doesn’t come from a third party,
Excel still considers it unauthenticated and displays a warning box. 
• Medium: Excel displays a dialog box asking if you
want to enable macros. If you are creating your own
macros, you should probably choose this setting.
• Low: Allows macros to run without you being noti-
fied first. This can be helpful if you run a lot of
macros, but be aware of the risk of using macros
from unknown sources. 
Select the Low setting only if you have virus scanning software that
checks your Microsoft Office files or you open only workbooks that
you know do not contain viruses.

Creating a Commission
Calculator
S
uppose you’re a business owner and you pay your salespeople a sliding
commission rate based on their total sales for a specified period, such
as a month. First, you need a sheet of paper to list each salesperson’s sales.
Then, at the end of the period, you have to subtotal each person’s sales.
Finally, you have to figure out which percent commission to give based
on that subtotal. 
With a Commission Calculator worksheet, designed with the use of basic
Excel features, as well as using several Excel functions (SUMIF, COUNTIF, and
nested IF statements), all you have to do is enter the individual sales. Excel
does the rest for you, saving you precious time and reducing the chance for
human error. To set a worksheet up, you do the following tasks:
➟
Enter basic headings
➟
Create a sliding commission rate table
➟
Define the data input area where you track the individual sales
➟
Design the calculation area where Excel calculates the totals and 
commission

Define the Sales Data Input Area
1.
At the bottom of the worksheet where you will enter the
individual sales, select the cells in the Salesperson col-
umn. In Figure 16-3, I selected cells C15 through C114,
which gives room for 100 sales entries.
2.
Choose Insert➪Name➪Define. The Define Name dialog
box appears.
3.
Type SalesRep for the range name; then click OK.
4.
In the same worksheet section, select the cells you will
use in the Sales Amount column. Be sure to include the
same number of cells you included in Step 1.
5.
Choose Insert➪Name➪Define. The Define Name dialog
box appears.
6.
Type SalesAmt for the range name; then click OK.
To verify the formulas you create in the next several sections, enter
some sample data in the sales data input area. 
Total Sales with the SUMIF Function 
1.
In cell C4, enter the following formula and then press
Enter: =SUMIF(SalesRep,A4,SalesAmt). If you entered
sample data in the sales data input area, you see the
total sales for the salesperson.
The Excel SUMIF function calculates the totals of numbers that
meet specified criteria. The function first asks for the area you want
to look at, then the cell it should look to match, and finally the
amount you want the function to total.
2.
Copy the formula in C4 to the end of your salesperson list
(see Figure 16-4). Chapter 2 shows how to copy formulas.

Total Sales with the SUMIF Function

Use the COUNTIF Function 
to Count Sales
1.
In cell B4, enter the following formula, then press
Enter: =COUNTIF(SalesRep,A4). If you entered sample
data in the sales data input area, you see the total num-
ber of sales for the salesperson.
The Excel COUNTIF function counts the number of entries that
meet specified criteria. The function first asks for the area you want to
look at, then the cell it should look to match. 
2.
Select cell B4 and choose Edit➪Copy. 
3.
Highlight cells B5 through the end of your salesperson list. 
4.
Choose Edit➪Paste. Excel duplicates the formulas to
include all the salespeople. (See Figure 16-5.)
Calculate Commission with 
a Nested IF Statement
1.
In cell D4, enter the beginning function and the first
parameter to check the total sales for the sales person
against the commission table. Type =IF(C4<$K$5 and
a comma.
If you created your commission table in a different location, change
the cell references to match your commission table.
Be sure to place the dollar signs in front of the cell references to
make them an absolute reference to a specific cell.
2.
Enter the first True result. Type C4*$L$4 and a comma.

3.
Enter the first False result that begins another IF state-
ment. Type IF(C4<$K$6 and a comma (see Figure 16-6).
4.
Enter the next True result. Type C4*$L$5 and a comma.
5.
Enter the next False result that again begins another IF
statement. Type IF(C4<$K$7 and a comma.
6.
Enter the third True result, if applicable. Type C4*$L$6
and a comma.
7.
Enter the third False result, which in my example is the
last level to check. Type C4*$L$7.
8.
Type three closing parentheses, enough to match
the number of opening parentheses and press Enter.
Figure 16-7 illustrates the final formula and its results.
9.
Copy the formula to the other rows.
The Excel IF function evaluates a condition you specify, and returns
one value if the statement is TRUE and another value if it evalu-
ates to FALSE. In this example, if the sales are less than the first
commission level, making the first condition TRUE, it calculates
the sales multiplied by the first level commission percentage. If the
statement is not TRUE, then Excel checks if the sales are less than
a second commission level, and if so, it multiplies the sales times
that commission level percentage. The nesting continues until Excel
checks all commission levels, resulting in a commission amount.
Create Totals
1.
In cell B11, or the cell below your last sales rep, create a
SUM function to total the cells above it. In Figure 16-8,
the formula =SUM(B4:B10) totals the sales orders.
2.
Select the formula in cell B11 and choose Edit➪Copy.
3.
Select the cells C11 and D11 and choose Edit➪Paste.
Excel duplicates the formulas, which total the sales
and commissions, respectively.

Tracking Medical
Expenses
W
ith today’s high cost of medical care, very few of us can be without
medical insurance. In fact, many of us have two insurance compa-
nies, perhaps Medicare and a supplemental insurance, or insurance through
your employer and your spouse’s employer. 
Tracking medical costs is very important, especially when filing your annual
tax return. In this project, you create an Excel spreadsheet that efficiently tracks
your expenses, generating totals, even sorting out prescriptions from the rest of
the medical expense totals. See at a glance how much your medical expenses
total, how much is paid by your insurance companies, and — most important
of all — how much you have to pay out of your pocket.
To accomplish this task, you use a number of Excel features including data
validation, duplication of worksheets, creating totals from other worksheets,
and a few Excel mathematical functions, too.
Hopefully your health is well and you won’t need to use this worksheet a lot!
But if you do . . . you’ll be glad it’s here.

Planning for Your
Financial Future
Your life is taking shape right in front of you. You and your spouse want
to buy a house, raise a family, and spend life happily ever after. Your
personal future depends a lot on your financial future. Fortunately, Excel has
several functions you can use to plan for the future you want. 
First, to keep up your expectations, you need to determine how much 
house you can afford to buy. But before you can buy the dream house, you
know you need to pay off some credit card debt. Next, from you own experi-
ence, you know that college is expensive, and the costs are bound to get
much higher by the time the kids are ready. Finally will come your golden
years. You dream of the house on the beach or traveling to exotic places. 
How are you ever going to save enough for that? This chapter shows you
how to
➟
Determine how much payments will run on that cute little ranch
house down the street. Excel has a PMT function to help with that.
➟
Plan to pay off a credit card balance using the NPER function, which
requires three key pieces of information: the interest rate, the current
payment amount, and the credit card balance.
➟
Determine how much you need to save each month to reach a college
fund or retirement goal. Again, utilize Excel’s PMT function.

Plan for a House
1.
In cell A1, type OUR DREAM HOUSE.
2.
In cells A3 through A8, type House Price, Down
Payment, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Term,
and Monthly Payment.
3.
In cell B3, enter the house price.
4.
In cell B4, enter the down payment amount.
5.
In cell B5, enter the formula =B3-B4. This gives the
amount you will finance.
6.
In cell B6, enter the interest rate. Format this amount as
a percentage.
7.
In cell B7, enter the loan term. Usually for a house, this
value is in years. See Figure 18-1.
8.
In cell B8, enter a PMT function to calculate the monthly
payment. The PMT function has three required argu-
ments (=PMT(RATE, NETPER, PV) so you need to
enter =PMT(B6/12,B7*12,B5). See Figure 18-2.
• RATE is the annual interest rate. You entered the
interest rate in cell B6. To get a monthly rate, you
divide this argument by 12.
• NETPER is the term of the loan that you entered in
cell B7. Because this value is in years, and you want
monthly payments, you multiply this argument by 12.
• PV represents the present value that is the amount
you will finance, not including interest. You calculated
this amount in cell B5.
When you type the start of a function, Excel displays a yellow box
containing a list of the arguments used by the function. Arguments
in brackets are optional.

Prepare to Pay Off a Credit 
Card Balance
1.
In cell D1, type PAY OFF CREDIT CARD.
2.
In cells D3, D4, and D5, type Monthly percentage rate,
Current payments, Credit card balance, and Months
until paid off, respectively.
3.
In cell E3, create a formula to enter the monthly percentage
rate you are paying on a credit card. For example if you
are paying a 21% annual interest, you enter =21%/12.
Excel displays a value of .0175, which is the 21% annual
rate divided by 12 months. (See Figure 18-3.)
4.
In cell E4, enter your current payment amount, preceded
with a minus sign. Enter -125 if you are making $125
payments every month against the credit card balance.
5.
In cell E5, enter the remaining balance on the credit card.
Like the payments, this must be entered as a negative
value such as -3700.
6.
Create an NPER formula to calculate how many months
you need to pay off the credit card. The formula should
read =NPER(E3,E4,E5). As you see in Figure 18-4, the
resulting answer shows how many months it will take to
pay off the credit card balance. The NPER function has
three required arguments: 
• Interest rate is usually given annually, so you divide it
by 12 to give a monthly rate. 
• Payment amount that you enter as a negative
amount. 
• Present value is the amount of the loan, not includ-
ing interest.

In cell B14, enter the savings goal amount. 
8.
In cell B15, enter the annual interest rate.
9.
In cell B16, enter the number of years you have until
you will need the money for college or retirement.
10.
In cell B17, enter the amount you already have saved
toward the goal.
11.
In cell B18, create a PMT formula that includes the interest
rate, term, and amount. You also need to add one of the
optional arguments: the future value argument. This time,
the PMT formula format is =PMT(interest rate,
term, current value, future value) so you
should enter =PMT(=PMT(B15/12, B16*12,B17,B14).
The PMT function actually has two optional arguments:
• Future Value is the balance of the loan after all
payments have been made. You do not need to enter
a future value unless the value at the end is not equal
to zero. 
• Payment Type, one or zero, which indicates
whether the payment occurs at the beginning of the
month (1) or the end of the month (0).

o single computer program does everything. You probably use multi-
ple applications for different tasks, such as playing Solitaire, surfing
the Internet, reading e-mail, and of course, working with Excel. If you use
Excel, you probably use Microsoft Word to handle creating memos, letters,
and other such documents.
In this chapter, I show you how to integrate two major Microsoft Office
applications: Word and Excel. You discover how you can create a worksheet
in Excel and include it in the middle of a Word document. 
If you begin by creating a table in Word, then conclude that you are better

Blending Excel and
PowerPoint 
O
ne of the most common ways to make others aware of your work is
by giving a presentation. The Microsoft Office product, PowerPoint, is
one of the most effective presentation products available in today’s market.
And because PowerPoint is part of the Microsoft Office suite, it’s very easy
to integrate information from other Office applications — in this example,
Excel — into a PowerPoint presentation.  
My mother always told me to do things right the first time. If you already
spent the time and energy to create information in Excel, why should you
have to re-create it in your PowerPoint presentation? You don’t. 
That’s what this chapter is about. You find out how to take the powerful 
worksheet data or creative chart that you created in Excel and copy it to a
PowerPoint slide. You can simply copy it once from Excel to PowerPoint, or
you can create a link so that if the data in Excel changes, your PowerPoint
presentation automatically reflects the changes. That’s doing it right the
first time.

Using Excel 
with Access
You can share data between Access and Excel in many ways. You can
copy data from an open worksheet and paste it into an Access data-
sheet, import a worksheet into an Access database, or simply load an
Access datasheet into Excel using the Analyze It with Excel command. 
This chapter shows you how to exchange data between Access and Excel
through one of several processes:
➟
Importing, which creates a copy of an Excel spreadsheet in Access 
format.
➟
Linking, which connects an Access table to an Excel worksheet. You can
view and edit the data in both the original program and in the Access
file. Linking is useful when you need to share Excel data between
Excel and Access users.
➟
Exporting, which lets you analyze your Access data in Excel format. 
This chapter assumes you already know general database terms, such as records,
fields, tables, queries, and primary keys. I also assume you know the basics
of creating and using an Access database.

Copy Data from Excel 
to an Access Table
1.
If you don’t already have an Access database created, from
Access, choose File➪New. If you already have an Access
database, open the database and skip Steps 2 and 3. 
2.
From the task pane, click Blank Database. The File New
Database window appears.
3.
Enter a name and location for the new database and click
Create. 
4.
Switch to the Excel worksheet that contains the data you
want to copy.
You cannot save an Excel worksheet as an Access database and
you cannot create a link to Access from within Excel.
5.
Highlight the cells you want to copy to Access. Be sure
to include headings if you have them, as shown in
Figure 21-1.
6.
Choose Edit➪Copy.
7.
Switch to the Access database. 
8.
Choose Edit➪Paste.
9.
Click Yes if you included column headings in Step 5.
A completion message box appears.
If you included headings, Access uses those headings as field
names in the table.
10.
Click OK. Access creates a new table in the database (see
Figure 21-2).

Chapter 21: Using Excel with Access

Import Data from Excel 
to an Access Table
1.
Prepare your Excel worksheet data before importing:
• If you don’t want to import the entire worksheet, in
the Excel workbook, create a named range containing
the cells that you want to import. (See Chapter 2.)
• Make sure the cells are in tabular format. If the work-
sheet contains merged cells, then the contents of the
cell are placed in the field that corresponds to the
leftmost column, and the other fields are left blank. 
• If the Excel spreadsheet has a cell containing more
than 255 characters, and the cell is in a row farther
than row 25, move the row up in the Excel list so it’s
within the first 25 records. Otherwise, Access trun-
cates the data to 255 characters. 
2.
If you don’t already have an Access database created, from
Access, choose File➪New. If you already have an Access
database, open the database and skip Steps 3 and 4. 
3.
From the task pane, click Blank Database. The File New
Database window appears (see Figure 21-3).
4.
Enter a name and location for the new database and
click Create.
5.
Choose File➪Get External Data➪Import. The Import
dialog box appears.
6.
Select Microsoft Excel from the Files of Type drop-down
list, as shown in Figure 21-4. 
7.
Select the Excel file from which you want to import data.
Importing a worksheet into Access creates a duplicate copy of the
data and does not make any changes to the source Excel file.
Figure 21-3: Create a new database for importing Excel data
Figure 21-4: Select Microsoft Excel as the file type you want to import
➟
187
Import Data from Excel to an Access Table

8.
Click the Import button. The Import Spreadsheet
Wizard appears (see Figure 21-5).
9.
Select whether to import the entire spreadsheet or a
range. If the spreadsheet has no named ranges and only
one worksheet, you do not see this screen. Click Next.
10.
Specify whether the first row of your worksheet contains
column headings. If it does, Access creates field names
from the first row. If it doesn’t, you can assign field
names in Step 12. Click Next.
11.
Specify whether you want the data in an existing table
or a new table. If you want the data in an existing table,
you need to select the table name. Click Next.
If you select an existing table, Access appends the data to the table.
Make the sure the number of columns in the worksheet or named
range matches the number of fields in the table. The name, date
type, and position of each column must also match those of the cor-
responding field in the Access table.
12.
Assign field names to each column by clicking each col-
umn and typing a name in the Field Name text box.
(See Figure 21-6.)
If a column name violates the field naming rules in Access, Access
assigns a valid name to the field. 
13.
Choose Yes or No if you want the field indexed.
Click Next.
Optionally, click on a column you don’t want to include and click the
Do Not Import Field (Skip) option. You can skip columns during the
import, but you can’t skip rows.

Chapter 21: Using Excel with Access

14.
Select an option for the primary index key. You can either
let Access create one for you, select your own primary
key or not have a primary key at all. Click Next.
15.
Enter a name for the Access table.
16.
Click Finish. Access imports the data and displays a
message box like the one in Figure 21-7.
If any errors incur during the import, Access creates an error log table
in the database and displays the name of the table in the message.
It’s a good idea to open the error log table and review the errors.
17.
Click OK. Access creates the table (see Figure 21-8).
To import multiple worksheets or named ranges, repeat the
import process for each worksheet or range.
18.
Review the imported data. Keep the following items in
mind:
• Graphical elements: Access does not import graphi-
cal elements, such as logos, charts, and pictures. 
• Data type: Access determines the data type based on
the first 25 rows of data. If any values beyond the
25th row are not compatible with the chosen data type,
Access ignores those values and does not import them. 
You cannot change the data type of the destination field during the
import operation, but you can change data types from the Access
table design.
• Calculated values: Access imports only the results of
a calculated cell, not the formula itself. If you need
the formulas to update, you need to link the Excel
worksheet to Access.
• Hyperlinks: Access imports cells containing hyperlinks
as text fields.

Import Data from Excel to an Access Table

Link an Excel Worksheet 
to an Access Database
1.
Begin by applying Steps 1 through 4 of the previous 
section.
2.
Choose File➪Open. The Open dialog box appears.
3.
From the Files of Type list box, select Microsoft Excel.
4.
Locate and select the Excel worksheet you want to link
to Access (see Figure 21-9).
5.
Click the Open button. Access creates a blank database
named with the Excel filename, and automatically starts
the Link Spreadsheet Wizard. 
6.
Select which worksheet or named range you want to
link. If the spreadsheet has no named ranges and only
a single worksheet, you do not see this screen. 
You can import only one worksheet or named range at a time. To link
multiple worksheets or named ranges, repeat the link operation.
7.
Click Next.
8.
Specify whether the first row of your worksheet contains
column headings (see Figure 21-10). If there are head-
ings, Access creates field names from the first row. If not,
Access assumes the first row is a record. 
9.
Click Next. Enter a name for the table.
10.
Click Create.
11.
Click Finish. A completion message box appears.
12.
Click OK.

Chapter 21: Using Excel with Access

13.
Double-click the Access table that appears as an Excel icon
with an arrow next to it (as shown in Figure 21-11). Keep
the following in mind when reviewing the data in Access:
• Graphics, such as logos, charts or pictures, stored in
the Excel worksheet, are not visible in Access. 
• You cannot change the field data type or size.
• The source cells that contain formulas display only as
results in Access, but you cannot modify the values in
Access.
• Access stores Excel cells longer than 255 characters in
a memo field that displays only the first 255 characters. 
If you delete the table from Access, you’re deleting only the link,
not the actual Excel worksheet.
Analyze Access Data 
with Microsoft Excel 
1.
Open the Access database you want to analyze.
2.
Select the datasheet, form, or report you want to analyze. 
3.
Choose Tools➪Office Links➪Analyze It with Microsoft
Excel. The datasheet opens in Microsoft Excel as an
Excel worksheet. Figure 21-12 shows both the Access
form and the Excel worksheet.
Access saves the datasheet as an Excel file in the same location as
the Access file. If a file already exists with that name, Access prompts
you to overwrite the existing file. If you choose not to, then Access
prompts you for a filename and location.
The worksheet is not linked to Access. Any changes made to the
Excel worksheet do not appear in the Access datasheet.

Export Access Data to Excel
1.
Open the Access database and select the database object
that you want to export. (See Figure 21-13.) The follow-
ing table illustrates what Access exports, depending on
the object and the view you have open when perform-
ing the export.
You can export only an Access table, query, form, or report. You
cannot export data Access pages, macros, or modules.

3.
In the Save as Type box, choose Microsoft Excel 97-2003. 
4.
From the Save In box, select a location in which to save
the file, as shown in Figure 21-15.
5.
In the File Name box, enter a name for the file. By
default, Access suggests the Access object name.

➟
192
Chapter 21: Using Excel with Access

6.
Optionally, if you are exporting a table or a query, click
the Save Formatted check box, which tells Access to also
export the field formatting. If the filename you selected
in Step 5 already exists, one of the following occurs:
• If you don’t select the option, and the filename you
choose already exists, Access doesn’t overwrite the
file; it adds a new worksheet to the file with the same
name as the object that is being exported.
• If you select the option and export a table, the Excel
worksheet takes on formatting similar to the Access
table, but overwrites the existing worksheet contents.
• If you select the option and if you export an Access
form or report, Access overwrites the Excel workbook
by removing the original worksheets, and creating a
new worksheet with the same name as the exported
object.
7.
Click the Export button or, if you want to export only a
pre-selected datasheet portion, click Save Selection. Addi-
tionally, the following actions occur during the export:
• Graphic items such as images do not export. 
• Only calculation results export, not the calculation
itself.
• Check boxes on forms do not export.
• Subreports export, but subforms do not. 
• Date values earlier than Jan 1, 1900, do not export
and are replaced with a Null value.
8.
Open the Excel worksheet and validate the export 
feature. (See Figure 21-16.) For example, if a value was
Null in Access, during the export, the values might be
replaced with the data that should be in the adjacent
column in the resulting worksheet.
