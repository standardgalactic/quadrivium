Preface
As with the previous editions, the range of material covered in this ﬁfth edition is
regarded as appropriate for a ﬁrst-level core studies course in mathematics for under-
graduate courses in all engineering disciplines. Whilst designed primarily for use by 
engineering students it is believed that the book is also highly suitable for students 
of the physical sciences and applied mathematics. Additional material appropriate for
second-level undergraduate core studies, or possibly elective studies for some engin-
eering disciplines, is contained in the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics.
The objective of the authoring team remains that of achieving a balance between 
the development of understanding and the mastering of solution techniques, with the
emphasis being on the development of the student’s ability to use mathematics with
understanding to solve engineering problems. Consequently, the book is not a collection
of recipes and techniques designed to teach students to solve routine exercises, nor is
mathematical rigour introduced for its own sake. To achieve the desired objective the
text contains:
l
Worked examples
Approximately 500 worked examples, many of which incorporate mathematical
models and are designed both to provide relevance and to reinforce the role of
mathematics in various branches of engineering. In response to feedback from users,
additional worked examples have been incorporated within this revised edition.
l
Applications
To provide further exposure to the use of mathematical models in engineering
practice, each chapter contains sections on engineering applications. These sec-
tions form an ideal framework for individual, or group, case study assignments
leading to a written report and/or oral presentation, thereby helping to develop
the skills of mathematical modelling necessary to prepare for the more open-
ended modelling exercises at a later stage of the course.
l
Exercises
There are numerous exercise sections throughout the text, and at the end of each
chapter there is a comprehensive set of review exercises. While many of the
exercise problems are designed to develop skills in mathematical techniques,
others are designed to develop understanding and to encourage learning by doing,
and some are of an open-ended nature. This book contains over 1200 exercises
and answers to all the questions are given. It is hoped that this provision,
together with the large number of worked examples and style of presentation,

xxii
PREFACE
also makes the book suitable for private or directed study. Again in response to
feedback from users, the frequency of exercises sections has been increased and
additional questions have been added to many of the sections.
l
Numerical methods
Recognizing the increasing use of numerical methods in engineering practice,
which often complement the use of analytical methods in analysis and design
and are of ultimate relevance when solving complex engineering problems,
there is wide agreement that they should be integrated within the mathematics
curriculum. Consequently the treatment of numerical methods is integrated
within the analytical work throughout the book.
Much of the feedback from users relates to the role and use of software packages, 
particularly symbolic algebra packages, in the teaching of mathematics to engineering 
students. In response, use of such packages continues to be a signiﬁcant feature of 
this new edition. Whilst any appropriate software package can be used, the authors 
recommend the use of MATLAB and/or MAPLE and have continued to adopt their 
use in this text. Throughout, emphasis will be on the use of MATLAB, with reference 
made to corresponding MAPLE commands and differences in syntax highlighted.
MATLAB/MAPLE commands have been introduced and illustrated, as inserts, throughout
the text so that their use can be integrated into the teaching and learning processes.
Students are strongly encouraged to use one of these packages to check the answers to
the examples and exercises. It is stressed that the MATLAB/MAPLE inserts are not
intended to be a ﬁrst introduction of the package to students; it is anticipated that they
will receive an introductory course elsewhere and will be made aware of the excellent
‘help’ facility available. The purpose of incorporating the inserts is not only to improve
efﬁciency in the use of the package but also to provide a facility to help develop a 
better understanding of the related mathematics. Whilst use of such packages takes the
tedium out of arithmetic and algebraic manipulations it is important that they are used
to enhance understanding and not to avoid it. It is recognised that not all users of the
text will have access to either MATLAB or MAPLE, and consequently all the inserts
are highlighted and can be ‘omitted’ without loss of continuity in developing the sub-
ject content. Throughout the text two icons are used
l
An open screen 
indicates that use of a software package would be useful 
(e.g. for checking solutions) but not essential
l
A closed screen 
indicates that the use of a software package is essential or 
highly desirable.
Feedback, from users of the previous edition, on the subject content has been favour-
able, and consequently no new chapters have been introduced. However, in response 
to the feedback, chapters have been reviewed and amended/updated accordingly. 
Whilst subject content at this level has not changed much over the years the mode 
of delivery is being driven by developments in computer technology. Consequently
there has been a shift towards online teaching and learning, coupled with student self-
study programmes. In support of such programmes, worked examples and exercises
sections are seen by many as the backbone of the text. Consequently in this new edi-
tion emphasis is given to strengthening the ‘Worked Examples’ throughout the text and
increasing the frequency and number of questions in the ‘Exercises Sections’. This has
involved the restructuring, sometimes signiﬁcant, of material within individual chapters.

NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
1.1
Introduction
Mathematics plays an important role in our lives. It is used in everyday activities from
buying food to organizing maintenance schedules for aircraft. Through applications
developed in various cultural and historical contexts, mathematics has been one of the
decisive factors in shaping the modern world. It continues to grow and to ﬁnd new uses,
particularly in engineering and technology.
Mathematics provides a powerful, concise and unambiguous way of organizing and
communicating information. It is a means by which aspects of the physical universe can
be explained and predicted. It is a problem-solving activity supported by a body of
knowledge. Mathematics consists of facts, concepts, skills and thinking processes –
aspects that are closely interrelated. It is a hierarchical subject in that new ideas and
skills are developed from existing ones. This sometimes makes it a difﬁcult subject for
learners who, at every stage of their mathematical development, need to have ready
recall of material learned earlier.
In the ﬁrst two chapters we shall summarize the concepts and techniques that most
students will already understand and we shall extend them into further developments in
mathematics. There are four key areas of which students will already have considerable
knowledge.
l
numbers
l
algebra
l
geometry
l
functions
These areas are vital to making progress in engineering mathematics (indeed, they will
solve many important problems in engineering). Here we will aim to consolidate that
knowledge, to make it more precise and to develop it. In this ﬁrst chapter we will deal
with the ﬁrst three topics; functions are considered in Chapter 2.
1.2
Number and arithmetic
1.2.1
Number line
Mathematics has grown from primitive arithmetic and geometry into a vast body of
knowledge. The most ancient mathematical skill is counting, using, in the ﬁrst instance,
the natural numbers and later the integers. The term natural numbers commonly refers
to the set  = {1, 2, 3, …}, and the term integers to the set  = {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, 
−3, …}. The integers can be represented as equally spaced points on a line called the
number line as shown in Figure 1.1. In a computer the integers can be stored exactly.
The set of all points (not just those representing integers) on the number line represents
the real numbers (so named to distinguish them from the complex numbers, which are 
Figure 1.1
The number line.

1.2 NUMBER AND ARITHMETIC

discussed in Chapter 3). The set of real numbers is denoted by . The general real num-
ber is usually denoted by the letter x and we write ‘x in ’, meaning x is a real number.
A real number that can be written as the ratio of two integers, like
or −, is called a
rational number. Other numbers, like ÷2 and π, that cannot be expressed in that way
are called irrational numbers. In a computer the real numbers can be stored only to 
a limited number of ﬁgures. This is a basic difference between the ways in which 
computers treat integers and real numbers, and is the reason why the computer languages
commonly used by engineers distinguish between integer values and variables on the
one hand and real number values and variables on the other.
1.2.2
Representation of numbers
For everyday purposes we use a system of representation based on ten numerals: 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. These ten symbols are sufﬁcient to represent all numbers if a posi-
tion notation is adopted. For whole numbers this means that, starting from the right-
hand end of the number, the least signiﬁcant end, the ﬁgures represent the number of
units, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Thus one thousand, three hundred and sixty-
ﬁve is represented by 1365, and two hundred and nine is represented by 209. Notice the
role of the 0 in the latter example, acting as a position keeper. The use of a decimal point
makes it possible to represent fractions as well as whole numbers. This system uses ten
symbols. The number system is said to be ‘to base ten’ and is called the decimal sys-
tem. Other bases are possible: for example, the Babylonians used a number system to
base sixty, a fact that still inﬂuences our measurement of time. In some societies a num-
ber system evolved with more than one base, a survival of which can be seen in imper-
ial measures (inches, feet, yards, …). For some applications it is more convenient to
use a base other than ten. Early electronic computers used binary numbers (to base
two); modern computers use hexadecimal numbers (to base sixteen). For elementary
(pen-and-paper) arithmetic a representation to base twelve would be more convenient
than the usual decimal notation because twelve has more integer divisors (2, 3, 4, 6)
than ten (2, 5).
In a decimal number the positions to the left of the decimal point represent units
(100), tens (101), hundreds (102) and so on, while those to the right of the decimal point
represent tenths (10−1), hundredths (10−2) and so on. Thus, for example

so
214.36 = 2(102) + 1(101) + 4(100) +
= 200 + 10 + 4 +
=
In other number bases the pattern is the same: in base b the position values are b0,
b1, b2, … and b−1, b−2, … . Thus in binary (base two) the position values are units, twos,
fours, eights, sixteens and so on, and halves, quarters, eighths and so on. In hexadecimal
(base sixteen) the position values are units, sixteens, two hundred and ﬁfty-sixes and so
on, and sixteenths, two hundred and ﬁfty-sixths and so on.

Write (a) the binary number 10111012 as a decimal number and (b) the decimal 
number 11510 as a binary number.
Solution
(a) 10111012 = 1(26) + 0(25) + 1(24) + 1(23) + 1(22) + 0(21) + 1(20)

1.2.3
Rules of arithmetic
The basic arithmetical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are
performed subject to the Fundamental Rules of Arithmetic. For any three numbers 
a, b and c:
(a1) the commutative law of addition
a + b = b + a
(a2) the commutative law of multiplication
a × b = b × a
(b1) the associative law of addition
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
(b2) the associative law of multiplication
(a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
(c1) the distributive law of multiplication over addition and subtraction
(a + b) × c = (a × c) + (b × c)
(a −b) × c = (a × c) −(b × c)
(c2) the distributive law of division over addition and subtraction
(a + b) ÷ c = (a ÷ c) + (b ÷ c)
(a −b) ÷ c = (a ÷ c) −(b ÷ c)
Here the brackets indicate which operation is performed ﬁrst. These operations are
called binary operations because they associate with every two members of the set of
real numbers a unique third member; for example,
2 + 5 = 7
and
3 × 6 = 18

NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
Example 1.3
Find the value of (100 + 20 + 3) × 456.
Solution
Using the distributive law we have
(100 + 20 + 3) × 456 = 100 × 456 + 20 × 456 + 3 × 456
= 45 600 + 9120 + 1368 = 56 088
Here 100 × 456 has been evaluated as
100 × 400 + 100 × 50 + 100 × 6
and similarly 20 × 456 and 3 × 456.
This, of course, is normally set out in the traditional school arithmetic way:
456
123 ×
1 368
9 120
45 600
56 088
Example 1.4
Rewrite (a + b) × (c + d) as the sum of products.
Solution
Using the distributive law we have
(a + b) × (c + d) = a × (c + d) + b × (c + d)
= (c + d) × a + (c + d) × b
= c × a + d × a + c × b + d × b
= a × c + a × d + b × c + b × d
applying the commutative laws several times.
A further operation used with real numbers is that of powering. For example, a × a
is written as a2, and a × a × a is written as a3. In general the product of n a’s where 
n is a positive integer is written as an. (Here the n is called the index or exponent.)
Operations with powering also obey simple rules:
an × am = an+m
(1.1a)
an ÷ am = an−m
(1.1b)
(an)m = anm
(1.1c)
From rule (1.1b) it follows, by setting n = m and a ≠0, that a0 = 1. It is also convention
to take 00 = 1. The process of powering can be extended to include the fractional powers
like a1/2. Using rule (1.1c),

1.2 NUMBER AND ARITHMETIC
7
(a1/n)n = an/n = a1
and we see that
a1/n = n÷a
the nth root of a. Also, we can deﬁne a−m using rule (1.1b) with n = 0, giving
1 ÷ am = a−m,
a ≠0
Thus a−m is the reciprocal of am. In contrast with the binary operations +, ×, −and ÷,
which operate on two numbers, the powering operation ( )r operates on just one element
and is consequently called a unary operation. Notice that the fractional power
am/n = (n÷a)m = n÷(am)
is the nth root of am. If n is an even integer, then am/n is not deﬁned when a is negative.
When n÷a is an irrational number then such a root is called a surd.
Numbers like ÷2 were described by the Greeks as a-logos, without a ratio number.
An Arabic translator took the alternative meaning ‘without a word’ and used the arabic
word for ‘deaf’, which subsequently became surdus, Latin for deaf, when translated
from Arabic to Latin in the mid-twelfth century.
Example 1.5
Find the values of
(a) 271/3
(b) (−8)2/3
(c) 16−3/2
(d) (−2)−2
(e) (−1/8)−2/3
(f) (9)−1/2
Solution
(a) 271/3 = 3÷27 = 3
(b) (−8)2/3 = (3÷(−8))2 = (−2)2 = 4
(c) 16−3/2 = (161/2)−3 = (4)−3 =
=
(d) (−2)−2 =
(e) (−1/8)−2/3 = [3÷(−1/8)]−2 = [3÷(−1)/ 3÷(8)]−2 = [−1/2]−2 = 4
(f) (9)−1/2 = (3)−1 =

Solution
(a) ÷18 = ÷(2 × 9) = ÷2 × ÷9 = 3÷2
÷32 = ÷(2 × 16) = ÷2 × ÷16 = 4÷2
÷50 = ÷(2 × 25) = ÷2 × ÷25 = 5÷2
Thus ÷18 + ÷32 −÷50 = 2÷2.
(b) 6/÷2 = 3 × 2/÷2
Since 2 = ÷2 × ÷2, we have 6/÷2 = 3÷2.
(c) (1 −÷3)(1 + ÷3) = 1 + ÷3 −÷3 −3 = −2
(d) Using the result of part (c) 
can be simpliﬁed by multiplying ‘top and
bottom’ by 1 + ÷3 (notice the sign change in front of the ÷). Thus
=
= −1 −÷3
(e) (1 + ÷6)(1 −÷6) = 1 −÷6 + ÷6 −6 = −5
(f) Using the same technique as in part (d) we have
=
= −(1 −÷2 −÷6 + 2÷3)/5
This process of expressing the irrational number so that all of the surds are in the
numerator is called rationalization.
When evaluating arithmetical expressions the following rules of precedence are observed:
l
the powering operation ( )r is performed ﬁrst
l
then multiplication × and/or division ÷
l
then addition + and/or subtraction −
When two operators of equal precedence are adjacent in an expression the left-hand
operation is performed ﬁrst. For example
12 −4 + 13 = 8 + 13 = 21
and
15 ÷ 3 × 2 = 5 × 2 = 10

Inequalities
The number line (Figure 1.1) makes explicit a further property of the real numbers –
that of ordering. This enables us to make statements like ‘seven is greater than two’
and ‘ﬁve is less than six’. We represent this using the comparison symbols
, ‘greater than’
, ‘less than’
It also makes obvious two other comparators:
=, ‘equals’
≠, ‘does not equal’
These comparators obey simple rules when used in conjunction with the arithmetical
operations. For any four numbers a, b, c and d:
(a  b and c  d)
implies
a + c  b + d
(1.2a)
(a  b and c  d)
implies
a −c  b −d
(1.2b)
(a  b and b  c)
implies
a  c
(1.2c)
a  b
implies
a + c  b + c
(1.2d)
(a  b and c  0)

(1.2e)
(a  b and c  0)

(1.2f)
(a  b and ab  0)

Example 1.8
Show, without using a calculator, that ÷2 + ÷3  2(4÷6).
Solution
By squaring we have that
(÷2 + ÷3)2 = 2 + 2÷2÷3 + 3 = 5 + 2÷6
Also
(2÷6)2 = 24  25 = 52
implying that 5  2÷6. Thus
(÷2 + ÷3)2  2÷6 + 2÷6 = 4÷6
and, since ÷2 + ÷3 is a positive number, it follows that
÷2 + ÷3  ÷(4÷6) = 2(4÷6)

where the comparator  indicates ‘greater than or equal to’. (Likewise  indicates ‘less
than or equal to’.)
Geometrically | x | is the distance of the point representing x on the number line from
the point representing zero. Similarly | x −a | is the distance of the point representing x
on the number line from that representing a.
The set of numbers between two numbers, a and b say, deﬁnes an open interval
on the real line. This is the set {x:a  x  b, x in } and is usually denoted by (a, b).
(Set notation will be fully described in Chapter 6; here {x:P} denotes the set of all x that
have property P.) Here the double-sided inequality means that x is greater than a and
less than b; that is, the inequalities a  x and x  b apply simultaneously. An interval
that includes the end points is called a closed interval, denoted by [a, b], with
[a, b] = {x:a  x  b, x in }
Note that the distance between two numbers a and b might either be a −b or b −a
depending on which was the larger. An immediate consequence of this is that
| a −b | = | b −a |
since a is the same distance from b as b is from a.
Example 1.9
Find the values of x so that
| x −4.3 | = 5.8
Solution
| x −4.3 | = 5.8 means that the distance between the real numbers x and 4.3 is 5.8 units,
but does not tell us whether x  4.3 or whether x  4.3. The situation is illustrated in
Figure 1.2, from which it is clear that the two possible values of x are −1.5 and 10.1.
Example 1.10
Express the sets (a) {x:| x −3 |  5, x in } and (b) {x:| x + 2 |  3, x in } as intervals.
Solution
(a) | x −3 |  5 means that the distance of the point representing x on the number line
from the point representing 3 is less than 5 units, as shown in Figure 1.3(a). This
implies that
−5  x −3  5
Adding 3 to each member of this inequality, using rule (1.2d), gives
−2  x  8
and the set of numbers satisfying this inequality is the open interval (−2, 8).
(b) Similarly | x + 2 |  3, which may be rewritten as | x −(−2)|  3, means that the 
distance of the point x on the number line from the point representing −2 is less than 
or equal to 3 units, as shown in Figure 1.3(b). This implies
−3  x + 2  3

12
NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
Subtracting 2 from each member of this inequality, using rule (1.2d), gives
−5  x  1
and the set of numbers satisfying this inequality is the closed interval [−5, 1].
It is easy (and sensible) to check these answers using spot values. For example,
putting x = −4 in (b) gives |−4 + 2 |  3 correctly. Sometimes the sets | x + 2 |  3 and
| x + 2 |  3 are described verbally as ‘lies in the interval x equals −2 ± 3’.

We note in passing the following results. For any two real numbers x and y:
| xy | = | x | | y |
(1.4a)
| x |  a, a  0,
implies
−a  x  a
(1.4b)
| x + y |  | x | + | y |,
known as the ‘triangle inequality’
(1.4c)
(x + y)  ÷(xy),
when x  0 and y  0
(1.4d)
Result (1.4d) is proved in Example 1.11 below and may be stated in words as
the arithmetic mean
(x + y) of two positive numbers x and y is greater
than or equal to the geometric mean ÷(xy). Equality holds only when y = x.
Results (1.4a) to (1.4c) should be veriﬁed by the reader, who may ﬁnd it helpful to
try some particular values ﬁrst, for example, setting x = −2 and y = 3 in (1.4c).
Example 1.11
Prove that for any two positive numbers x and y, the arithmetic–geometric inequality
(x + y)  ÷(xy)
holds.
Deduce that 
for any positive number x.
Solution
The quantity xy can be interpreted as the area of a rectangle with sides x and y. The
quantity (x + y)2 can be interpreted as the area of a square of side (x + y). Comparing
areas in Figure 1.4, where the broken lines cut the square into 4 equal quarters of size
A and it is assumed that x  y.
From Figure 1.4, we see that

In the particular case when x = y then B = D = 0 and
x2 + y2 = 2xy
so in general

Combining (1.5) and (1.6) we deduce

Algebra
The origins of algebra are to be found in Arabic mathematics as the name suggests,
coming from the word aljabara meaning ‘combination’ or ‘re-uniting’. Algorithms 
are rules for solving problems in mathematics by standard step-by-step methods. 
Such methods were ﬁrst described by the ninth century mathematician Abu Ja’far
Mohammed ben Musa from Khwarizm, modern Khiva on the southern border of
Uzbekistan. The Arabic al-Khwarizm (‘from Khwarizm’) was Latinized to algorithm 
in the late Middle Ages. Often the letter x is used to denote an unassigned (or free) 
variable. It is thought that this is a corruption of the script letter r abbreviating the Latin
word res, thing. The use of unassigned variables enables us to form mathematical 
models of practical situations as illustrated in the following example. First we deal with
a speciﬁc case and then with the general case using unassigned variables.
The idea, ﬁrst introduced in the seventeenth century, of using letters to represent
unspeciﬁed quantities led to the development of algebraic manipulation based on the
elementary laws of arithmetic. This development greatly enhanced the problem-solving
power of mathematics – so much so that it is difﬁcult now to imagine doing mathematics
without this resource.

density is ρ kg m−3. Notice here that the unassigned variables l, D, d, ρ are pure num-
bers and do not include units of measurement.
Solution
(a) Standardizing the units of length, the internal and external diameters are 0.16m and
0.205m respectively. The area of cross-section of the pipe is
0.25π(0.2052 −0.1602) m2
(Reminder: The area of a circle of diameter D is πD2/4.)
Hence the volume of the material of the pipe is
0.25π(0.2052 −0.1602) × 1.5 m3
and the mass (volume × density) of the pipe is
0.25 × 5500 × π(0.2052 −0.1602) × 1.5 kg
Evaluating this last expression by calculator gives the mass of the pipe as 106 kg to the
nearest kilogram.
(b) The internal and external diameters of the pipe are d/1000 and D/1000 metres,
respectively, so that the area of cross-section is
0.25π(D2 −d 2)/1000000m2
The volume of the pipe is
0.25πl(D2 −d 2)/106 m3
Hence the mass M kg of the pipe of density ρ is given by the formulae
M = 0.25πρl(D2 −d 2)/106 = 2.5πρl(D + d)(D −d) × 10−5

Algebraic manipulation
Algebraic manipulation made possible concise statements of well-known results, such as
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(1.7a)
Previously these results had been obtained by a combination of verbal reasoning and
elementary geometry as illustrated in Figure 1.6.

Prove that
ab =
[(a + b)2 −(a −b)2]
Given 702 = 4900 and 362 = 1296, calculate 53 × 17.
Solution
Since
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
we deduce
(a −b)2 = a2 −2ab + b2
and
(a + b)2 −(a −b)2 = 4ab
and
ab =
[(a + b)2 −(a −b)2]
The result is illustrated geometrically in Figure 1.7. Setting a = 53 and b = 17, we have
53 × 17 =
[702 −362] = 901
This method of calculating products was used by the Babylonians and is sometimes called
the ‘quarter-squares’ algorithm. It has been used in some analogue devices and simulators.

Solution
(x + p)2 = x2 + 2px + p2
so that

Working in the reverse direction is more difﬁcult
ax2 + bx + c =
Comparing 
with x2 + 2px + q, we can identify

This algebraic process is called ‘completing the square’.
We may summarize the results so far

The number 45 can be factorized as 3 × 3 × 5. Any product from 3, 3 and 5 is also a
factor of 45. Algebraic expressions can be factorized in a similar fashion. An algebraic
expression with more than one term can be factorized if each term contains common
factors (either numerical or algebraic). These factors are removed by division from each
term and the non-common factors remaining are grouped into brackets.
Example 1.18
Factorize xz + 2yz −2y −x.
Solution
There is no common factor to all four terms so we take them in pairs:
xz + 2yz −2y −x = (x + 2y)z −(2y + x)
= (x + 2y)z −(x + 2y)
= (x + 2y)(z −1)
Alternatively, we could have written
xz + 2yz −2y −x = (xz −x) + (2yz −2y)
= x(z −1) + 2y(z −1)
= (x + 2y)(z −1)
to obtain the same result.
In many problems we are able to facilitate the solution by factorizing a quadratic
expression ax2 + bx + c ‘by-hand’, using knowledge of the factors of the numerical
coefﬁcients a, b and c.

Example 1.19
Factorize the expressions
(a) x2 + 12x + 35
(b) 2x2 + 9x −5
Solution
(a) Since
(x + α)(x + β) = x2 + (α + β)x + αβ
we examine the factors of the constant term of the expression:
35 = 5 × 7 = 35 × 1
and notice that 5 + 7 = 12 while 35 + 1 = 36. So we can chose α = 5 and β = 7 and write
x2 + 12x + 35 = (x + 5)(x + 7)
(b) Since
(mx + α)(nx + β) = mnx2 + (nα + mβ)x + αβ
we examine the factors of the coefﬁcient of x2 and of the constant to give the coefﬁcient
of x. Here
2 = 2 × 1 and −5 = (−5) × 1 = 5 × (−1)
and we see that
2 × 5 + 1 × (−1) = 9
Thus we can write
(2x −1)(x + 5) = 2x2 + 9x −5
It is sensible to do a ‘spot-check’ on the factorization by inserting a sample value of x,
for example x = 1
(1)(6) = 2 + 9 −5
Comment
Some quadratic expressions, for example x2 + y2, do not have real factors.
The expansion of (a + b)2 in (1.7a) is a special case of a general result for (a + b)n
known as the binomial expansion. This is discussed again in Sections 1.3.6 and 7.7.2.
Here we shall look at the cases for n = 0, 1, … , 6.
Writing these out, we have
(a + b)0 = 1
(a + b)1 = a + b
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3
(a + b)4 = a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4
(a + b)5 = a5 + 5a4b + 10a3b2 + 10a2b3 + 5ab4 + b5
(a + b)6 = a6 + 6a5b + 15a4b2 + 20a3b3 + 15a2b4 + 6ab5 + b6

1.3 ALGEBRA

This table can be extended indeﬁnitely. Each line can easily be obtained from the 
previous one. Thus, for example,
(a + b)4 = (a + b)(a + b)3
= a(a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3) + b(a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3)
= a4 + 3a3b + 3a2b2 + ab3 + a3b + 3a2b2 + 3ab3 + b4
= a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4
The coefﬁcients involved form a pattern of numbers called Pascal’s triangle, shown 
in Figure 1.8. Each number in the interior of the triangle is obtained by summing the
numbers to its right and left in the row above, as indicated by the arrows in Figure 1.8.
This number pattern had been discovered prior to Pascal by the Chinese mathematician
Chu Shih-chieh.

Equations, inequalities and identities
It commonly occurs in the application of mathematics to practical problem-solving that
the numerical value of an expression involving unassigned variables is speciﬁed and we
have to ﬁnd the values of the unassigned variables which yield that value. We illustrate
the idea with the elementary examples that follow.
Example 1.21
A hollow cone of base diameter 100mm and height 150mm is held upside down and
ﬁlled with a liquid. The liquid is then transferred to a hollow circular cylinder of base
diameter 80mm. To what height is the cylinder ﬁlled?
Solution
The situation is illustrated in Figure 1.11. The capacity of the cone is
(base area) × (perpendicular height)
Thus the volume of liquid contained in the cone is
π(502)(150) = 125 000π mm3
The volume of the liquid in the circular cylinder is
(base area) × (height) = π(402)h mm3
where hmm is the height of the liquid in the cylinder. Equating these quantities (assuming
no liquid is lost in the transfer) we have
1600πh = 125 000π
This equation enables us to ﬁnd the value of the unassigned variable h:
h = 1250/16 = 78.125
Thus the height of the liquid in the cylinder is 78mm to the nearest millimetre.

NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
In the previous example we made use of the formula for the volume V of a cone of base
diameter D and height H. We normally shorthand this as
V =
πD2H
understanding that the units of measurement are compatible. This formula also tells us
the height of such a cone in terms of its volume and base diameter
This type of rearrangement is common and is generally described as ‘changing the 
subject of the formula’.
Example 1.22
A dealer bought a number of equally priced articles for a total cost of £120. He sold all
but one of them, making a proﬁt of £1.50 on each article with a total revenue of £135.
How many articles did he buy?
Solution
Let n be the number of articles bought. Then the cost of each article was £(120/n). 
Since (n −1) articles were sold the selling price of each article was £(135/(n −1)). 
Thus the proﬁt per item was
which we are told is equal to £1.50. Thus
This implies
135n −120(n −1) = 1.50(n −1)n
Dividing both sides by 1.5 gives
90n −80(n −1) = n2 −n
Simplifying and collecting terms we obtain
n2 −11n −80 = 0
This equation for n can be simpliﬁed further by factorizing the quadratic expression 
on the left-hand side
(n −16)(n + 5) = 0
This implies either n = 16 or n = −5, so the dealer initially bought 16 articles (the 
solution n = −5 is not feasible).

Here the ± symbol provides a neat shorthand for the two solutions.
Comments
(a) The formula given in (1.8) makes clear the three cases: where for b2  4ac
we have two real roots to the equation, for b2  4ac we have no real roots, and for
b2 = 4ac we have one real root (which is repeated). 
(b) The condition for equality of the roots of a quadratic equation occurs in practical
applications, and we shall illustrate this in Example 2.48 after considering the trigono-
metric functions.
(c) The quadratic equation has many important applications. One, which is of historical
signiﬁcance, concerned the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside. In 1871 the telephone
cable between England and Denmark developed a fault caused by a short circuit under
the sea. His task was to locate that fault. The cable had a uniform resistance per unit
length. His method of solution was brilliantly simple. The situation can be represented
schematically as shown in Figure 1.12.

NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
In the ﬁgure the total resistance of the line between A and B is a ohms and is known;
x and y are unknown. If we can ﬁnd x, we can locate the distance along the cable where
the fault has occurred. Heaviside solved the problem by applying two tests. First he
applied a battery, having voltage E, at A with the circuit open at B, and measured the
resulting current I1. Then he applied the same battery at A but with the cable earthed 
at B, and again measured the resulting current I2. Using Ohm’s law and the rules for
combining resistances in parallel and in series, this yields the pair of equations
E = I1(x + y)
E =
Writing b = E/I1 and c = E/I2, we can eliminate y from these equations to obtain an 
equation for x:
x2 −2cx + c(a + b) −ab = 0
which, using (1.8), has solutions
x = c ± ÷[(a −c)(b −c)]
From his experimental data Heaviside was able to predict accurately the location of 
the fault.
In some problems we have to ﬁnd the values of unassigned variables such that the 
value of an expression involving those variables satisﬁes an inequality condition (that
is, it is either greater than, or alternatively less than, a speciﬁed value). Solving such
inequalities requires careful observance of the rules for inequalities (1.2a–1.2g) set out
in Section 1.2.5.
Example 1.24
Find the values of x for which
(1.9)
Solution
(a) When 3 −x  0, that is x  3, we may, using (1.2e), multiply (1.9) throughout by
3 −x to give
1  2(3 −x)
which, using (1.2d, e), reduces to
x 
so that (1.9) is satisﬁed when both x  3 and x 
are satisﬁed; that is, x 
.

(b) When 3 −x  0, that is x  3, we may, using (1.2f), multiply (1.9) throughout by
3 −x to give
1  2(3 −x)
which reduces to x 
so that (1.9) is also satisﬁed when both x  3 and x 
; that is,
x  3. 
Thus inequality (1.9) is satisﬁed by values of x in the ranges x  3 and x 
.
Comment
A common mistake made is simply to multiply (1.9) throughout by 3 −x to give the 
answer x 
, forgetting to consider both cases of 3 −x  0 and 3 −x  0. We shall
return to consider this example from the graphical point of view in Example 2.36.
Example 1.25
Find the values of x such that
x2 + 2x + 2  50
Solution
Completing the square on the left-hand side of the inequality we obtain
(x + 1)2 + 1  50
which gives
(x + 1)2  49
Taking the square root of both sides of this inequality we deduce that
either (x + 1)  −7 or (x + 1)  7
Note particularly the ﬁrst of these inequalities. From these we deduce that
x2 + 2x + 2  50 for x  −8 or x  6
The reader should check these results using spot values of x, say x = −10 and x = 10.
Example 1.26
A food manufacturer found that the sales ﬁgure for a certain item depended on its 
selling price. The company’s market research department advised that the maximum
number of items that could be sold weekly was 20000 and that the number sold
decreased by 100 for every 1p increase in its price. The total production cost consisted
of a set-up cost of £200 plus 50p for every item manufactured. What price should the
manufacturer adopt?
Solution
The data supplied by the market research department suggests that if the price of the
item is p pence, then the number sold would be 20000 −100p. (So the company would
sell none with p = 200, when the price is £2.) The production cost in pounds would 
5

5
2
5

28
NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
be 200 + 0.5 × (number sold), so that in terms of p we have the production cost £C
given by
C = 200 + 0.5(20 000 −100p)
The revenue £R accrued by the manufacturer for the sales is (number sold) × (price),
which gives
R = (20 000 −100p)p/100
(remember to express the amount in pounds). Thus, the proﬁt £P is given by
P = R −C
= (20 000 −100p)p/100 −200 −0.5(20 000 −100p)
= −p2 + 250p −10 200
Completing the square we have
P = 1252 −(p −125)2 −10 200
= 5425 −(p −125)2
Since (p −125)2  0, we deduce that P  5425 and that the maximum value of P is
5425. To achieve this weekly proﬁt, the manufacturer should adopt the price £1.25.
It is important to distinguish between those equalities that are valid for a restricted 
set of values of the unassigned variable x and those that are true for all values of x. 
For example
(x −5)(x + 7) = 0
is true only if x = 5 or x = −7. In contrast
(x −5)(x + 7) = x2 + 2x −35
(1.10)
is true for all values of x. The word ‘equals’ here is being used in subtly different ways.
In the ﬁrst case ‘=’ means ‘is numerically equal to’; in the second case ‘=’ means ‘is
algebraically equal to’. Sometimes we emphasize the different meaning by means of 
the special symbol ≡, meaning ‘algebraically equal to’. (However, it is fairly common
practice in engineering to use ‘=’ in both cases.) Such equations are often called identities.
Identities that involve an unassigned variable x as in (1.10) are valid for all values of x,
and we can sometimes make use of this fact to simplify algebraic manipulations.
Example 1.27
Find the numbers A, B and C such that
x2 + 2x −35 ≡A(x −1)2 + B(x −1) + C
Solution
Method (a): Since x2 + 2x −35 ≡A(x −1)2 + B(x −1) + C it will be true for any value
we give to x. So we choose values that make ﬁnding A, B and C easy.

1.3 ALGEBRA
29
Choosing
x = 0
gives
−35 = A −B + C
Choosing
x = 1
gives
−32 = C
Choosing
x = 2
gives
−27 = A + B + C
So we obtain C = −32, with A −B = −3 and A + B = 5. Hence A = 1 and B = 4 to give
the identity
x2 + 2x −35 ≡(x −1)2 + 4(x −1) −32
Method (b): Expanding the terms on the right-hand side, we have
x2 + 2x −35 ≡Ax2 + (B −2A)x + A −B + C
The expressions on either side of the equals sign are algebraically equal, which means
that the coefﬁcient of x2 on the left-hand side must equal the coefﬁcient of x2 on the
right-hand side and so on. Thus
1 = A
2 = B −2A
−35 = A −B + C
Hence we ﬁnd A = 1, B = 4 and C = −32, as before.
Note: Method (a) assumes that a valid A, B and C exist.
Example 1.28
Find numbers A, B and C such that
x ≠1
Solution
Expressing the right-hand side as a single term, we have
which, with x ≠1, is equivalent to
x2 ≡(Ax + B)(x −1) + C
Choosing
x = 0
gives
0 = −B + C
Choosing
x = 1
gives
1 = C
Choosing
x = 2
gives
4 = 2A + B + C
Thus we obtain
C = 1, B = 1 and A = 1, yielding

Sufﬁx and sigma notation
We have seen in previous sections how letters are used to denote general or unspeciﬁed
values or numbers. This process has been extended in a variety of ways. In particular,
the introduction of sufﬁxes enables us to deal with problems that involve a high 
degree of generality or whose solutions have the ﬂexibility to apply in a large number of
situations. Consider for the moment an experiment involving measuring the temperature
of an object (for example, a piece of machinery or a cooling ﬁn in a heat exchanger) at
intervals over a period of time. In giving a theoretical description of the experiment we
would talk about the total period of time in general terms, say T minutes, and the time
interval between measurements as h minutes, so that the total number n of time intervals
would be given by T/h. Assuming that the initial and ﬁnal temperatures are recorded

1.3 ALGEBRA
31
there are (n + 1) measurements. In practice we would obtain a set of experimental
results, as illustrated partially in Figure 1.13.

96.57
93.18
91.53
…
26.43
24.91
23.57
Here we could talk about the twenty-ﬁrst reading and look it up in the table. In the 
theoretical description we would need to talk about any one of the (n + 1) temperature
measurements. To facilitate this we introduce a sufﬁx notation. We label the times at
which the temperatures are recorded t0, t1, t2, … , tn, where t0 corresponds to the time
when the initial measurement is taken, tn to the time when the ﬁnal measurement is
taken, and
t1 = t0 + h, t2 = t0 + 2h, … , tn = t0 + nh
so that tn = t0 + T. We label the corresponding temperatures by θ0, θ1, θ2, … , θn. We
can then talk about the general result θk as measuring the temperature at time tk.
In the analysis of the experimental results we may also wish to manipulate the data
we have obtained. For example, we might wish to work out the average value of the
temperature over the time period. With the 37 speciﬁc experimental results given in 
Figure 1.13 it is possible to compute the average directly as
(97.51 + 96.57 + 93.18 + 91.53 + … + 23.57)/37
In general, however, we have
(θ0 + θ1 + θ2 + … + θn)/(n + 1)
A compact way of writing this is to use the sigma notation for the extended summation
θ0 + θ1 + … + θn. We write
(Σ is the upper-case Greek letter sigma.)
to denote
θ0 + θ1 + θ2 + … + θn
Thus
= θ0 + θ1 + θ2 + θ3
and
= θ5 + θ6 + θ7 + θ8 + θ9 + θ10
The sufﬁx k appearing in the quantity to be summed and underneath the sigma symbol
is the ‘counting variable’ or ‘counter’. We may use any letter we please as a counter,
provided that it is not being used at the same time for some other purpose. Thus

Factorial notation and the binomial expansion
The special extended product of integers
1 × 2 × 3 × … × n = n × (n −1) × (n −2) × … × 1
has a special notation and name. It is called factorial n and is denoted by n!. Thus with
n! = n(n −1)(n −2) … (1)
as examples
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
and
8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1

An interpretation of n! is the total number of different ways it is possible to arrange n

This is because we can choose the ﬁrst letter in four different ways (S, E, A or T).
Once that choice is made, we can choose the second letter in three different ways, then
we can choose the third letter in two different ways. Having chosen the ﬁrst three 
letters, the last letter is automatically ﬁxed. For each of the four possible ﬁrst choices,
we have three possible choices for the second letter, giving us twelve (4 × 3) possible
choices of the ﬁrst two letters. To each of these twelve possible choices we have two
possible choices of the third letter, giving us twenty-four (4 × 3 × 2) possible choices
of the ﬁrst three letters. Having chosen the ﬁrst three letters, there is only one possible
choice of last letter. So in all we have 4! possible choices.

NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
Example 1.31
In how many ways can the letters of the word REGAL be arranged in a line, and in how
many of those do the two letters A and E appear in adjacent positions?
Solution
The word REGAL has ﬁve distinct letters, so they can be arranged in a line in 5! = 120
different ways. To ﬁnd out in how many of those arrangements the A and E appear
together, we consider how many arrangements can be made of RGL(AE) and RGL(EA),
regarding the bracketed terms as a single symbol. There are 4! possible arrangements
of both of these, so of the 120 different ways in which the letters of the word REGAL
can be arranged, 48 contain the letters A and E in adjacent positions.
The introduction of the factorial notation facilitates the writing down of many com-
plicated expressions. In particular it enables us to write down the general form of the
binomial expansion discussed earlier in Section 1.3.1. There we wrote out long-hand 
the expansion of (a + b)n for n = 0, 1, 2, … , 6 and noted the relationship between 
the coefﬁcients of (a + b)n and those of (a + b)n−1, shown clearly in Pascal’s triangle of
Figure 1.8.
If
(a + b)n−1 = c0an−1 + c1an−2b + c2an−3b2 + c3an−4b3 + … + cn−1bn−1
and
(a + b)n = d0an + d1an−1b + d2an−2b2 + … + dn−1abn−1 + dnbn
then, as described on p. 21 when developing Pascal’s triangle,
c0 = d0 = 1,
d1 = c1 + c0,
d2 = c2 + c1,
d3 = c3 + c2, …
and in general
dr = cr + cr−1
It is easy to verify that this relationship is satisﬁed by
and it can be shown that the coefﬁcient of an−rbr in the expansion of (a + b)n is
(1.11)
This is a very important result, with many applications. Using it we can write down the
general binomial expansion

The coefﬁcient 
is called the binomial coefﬁcient and has the special notation
Thus we may write
(1.13)
which is referred to as the general binomial expansion.
Example 1.32
Expand the expression (2 + x)5.
Solution
Setting a = 2 and b = x in the general binomial expansion we have
= (1)(25) + (5)(24)x + (10)(23)x2 + (10)(22)x3 + (5)(2)x4 + 1x5
since 
and so on. Thus
(2 + x)5 = 32 + 80x + 80x2 + 40x3 + 10x4 + x5

Coordinates
In addition to the introduction of algebraic manipulation another innovation made in the
seventeenth century was the use of coordinates to represent the position of a point P on a
plane as shown in Figure 1.14. Conventionally the point P is represented by an ordered pair
of numbers contained in brackets thus: (x, y). This innovation was largely due to Descartes
and consequently we often refer to (x, y) as the cartesian coordinates of P. This notation
is the same as that for an open interval on the number line introduced in Section 1.2.6,
but has an entirely separate meaning and the two should not be confused. Whether (x, y)
denotes an open interval or a coordinate pair is usually clear from the context.
1.4.2
Straight lines
The introduction of coordinates made possible the algebraic description of the plane
curves of classical geometry and the proof of standard results by algebraic methods.
Consider, for example, the point P lying on the line AB as shown in Figure 1.15. Let
P divide AB in the ratio λ:1 −λ. Then AP/AB = λ and, by similar triangles,
Let A, B and P have coordinates (x0, y0), (x1, y1) and (x, y) respectively, then from the diagram
AQ = x −x0, AC = x1 −x0, PQ = y −y0, BC = y1 −y0
Thus
from which we deduce, after some rearrangement,
(1.14)
which represents the equation of a straight line passing through two points (x0, y0) and
(x1, y1).
More simply, the equation of a straight line passing through the two points having
coordinates (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) may be written as
y = mx + c
(1.15)
where 
is the gradient (slope) of the line and 
is the inter- 
cept on the y axis.
A line perpendicular to y = mx + c has gradient −1/m as shown in Figure 1.16. The
gradient of the line PQ is OP/QO = m. The gradient of the line PR is −OP/OR. By sim-
ilar triangles POQ, POR we have OP/OR = OQ/OP = 1/m.

Equations of the form
y = mx + c
represent straight lines on the plane and, consequently, are called linear equations.
Example 1.33
Find the equation of the straight line that passes through the points (1, 2) and (3, 3).
Solution
Taking (x0, y0) = (1, 2) and (x1, y1) = (3, 3)
slope of line =
so from formula (1.14) the equation of the straight line is
y =
(x −1) + 2
which simpliﬁes to
y =
Example 1.34
Find the equation of the straight line passing through the point (3, 2) and parallel to the
line 2y = 3x + 4. Determine its x and y intercepts.
Solution
Writing 2y = 3x + 4 as
y =
we have from (1.15) that the slope of this line is . Since the required line is parallel to
this line, it will also have a slope of . (The slope of the line perpendicular to it is −.)
Thus from (1.15) it has equation
y =
To determine the constant c, we use the fact that the line passes through the point (3, 2),
so that
2 =
giving
c =
Thus the equation of the required line is
y =
or
2y = 3x −5
The y intercept is c =
.
To obtain the x intercept we substitute y = 0, giving
, so that the x intercept 
is
.

Thus the general equation

(1.16b)
represents a circle having centre (−f, −g) and radius ÷( f 2 + g2 −c). Notice that the
general circle has three constants f, g and c in its equation. This implies that we need
three points to specify a circle completely.
Example 1.35
Find the equation of the circle with centre (1, 2) and radius 3.
Solution
Using Pythagoras’ theorem, if the point P(x, y) lies on the circle then from (1.16a)
(x −1)2 + (y −2)2 = 32
Thus
x2 −2x + 1 + y2 −4y + 4 = 9

Circles
A circle is the planar curve whose points are all equidistant from a ﬁxed point 
called the centre of the circle. The simplest case is a circle centred at the origin with
radius r, as shown in Figure 1.18(a). Applying Pythagoras’ theorem to triangle OPQ 
we obtain
x2 + y2 = r2
(Note that r is a constant.) When the centre of the circle is at the point (a, b), rather than
the origin, the equation is
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2
(1.16a)
obtained by applying Pythagoras’ theorem in triangle O′PN of Figure 1.18(b). This
expands to
x2 + y2 −2ax −2by + (a2 + b2 −r2) = 0

1.4 GEOMETRY
39
giving the equation as
x2 + y2 −2x −4y −4 = 0
Example 1.36
Find the radius and the coordinates of the centre of the circle whose equation is
2x2 + 2y2 −3x + 5y + 2 = 0
Solution
Dividing through by the coefﬁcient of x2 we obtain
x2 + y2 −
+ 1 = 0
Now completing the square on the x terms and the y terms separately gives
Hence, from (1.16a), the circle has radius (3÷2)/4 and centre (3/4, −5/4).
Example 1.37
Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points (0, 0), (0, 2), (4, 0).
Solution
Method (a): From (1.16b) the general equation of a circle is
x2 + y2 + 2fx + 2gy + c = 0
Substituting the three points into this equation gives three equations for the unknowns
f, g and c.
Thus substituting (0, 0) gives c = 0, substituting (0, 2) gives 4 + 4g + c = 0 and 
substituting (4, 0) gives 16 + 8f + c = 0. Solving these equations gives g = −1, f = −2
and c = 0, so the required equation is
x2 + y2 −4x −2y = 0
Method (b): From Figure 1.19 using the geometrical properties of the circle, we see that
its centre lies at (2, 1) and since it passes through the origin its radius is ÷5. Hence, from
(1.16a), its equation is
(x −2)2 + (y −1)2 = (÷5)2

as before.
Example 1.38
Find the point of intersection of the line y = x −1 with the circle x2 + y2 −4y −1 = 0.
Solution
Substituting y = x −1 into the formula for the circle gives
x2 + (x −1)2 −4(x −1) −1 = 0
which simpliﬁes to
x2 −3x + 2 = 0
This equation may be factored to give
(x −2)(x −1) = 0
so that x = 1 and x = 2 are the roots. Thus the points of intersection are (1, 0) and (2, 1).
Example 1.39
Find the equation of the tangent at the point (2, 1) of the circle x2 + y2 −4y −1 = 0.
Solution
A tangent is a line, which is the critical case between a line intersecting the circle in 
two distinct points and it not intersecting at all. We can describe this as the case when
the line cuts the circle in two coincident points. Thus the line, which passes through 
(2, 1) with slope m
y = m(x −2) + 1
is a tangent to the circle when the equation
x2 + [m(x −2) + 1]2 −4[m(x −2) + 1] −1 = 0
has two equal roots. Multiplying these terms out we obtain the equation
(m2 + 1)x2 −2m(2m + 1)x + 4(m2 + m −1) = 0
The condition for this equation to have equal roots is (using comment (a) of Example
1.23)
4m2(2m + 1)2 = 4[4(m2 + m −1)(m2 + 1)]
This simpliﬁes to
m2 −4m + 4 = 0
or
(m −2)2 = 0
giving the result m = 2 and the equation of the tangent y = 2x −3.

Conics
The circle is one of the conic sections (Figure 1.20) introduced around 200 bc by
Apollonius, who published an extensive study of their properties in a textbook that 
he called Conics. He used this title because he visualized them as cuts made by a ‘ﬂat’
or plane surface when it intersects the surface of a cone in different directions, as illus-
trated in Figures 1.21(a–d). Note that the conic sections degenerate into a point and
straight lines at the extremities, as illustrated in Figures 1.21(e–g). Although at the time
of Apollonius his work on conics appeared to be of little value in terms of applications,
it has since turned out to have considerable importance. This is primarily due to the fact
that the conic sections are the paths followed by projectiles, artiﬁcial satellites, moons
and the Earth under the inﬂuence of gravity around planets or stars. The early Greek
astronomers thought that the planets moved in circular orbits, and it was not until 1609
that the German astronomer Johannes Kepler described their paths correctly as being
elliptic, with the Sun at one focus. It is quite possible for an orbit to be a curve other
than an ellipse. Imagine a meteor or comet approaching the Sun from some distant
region in space. The path that the body will follow depends very much on the speed 
at which it is moving. If the body is small compared to the Sun, say of planetary 
dimensions, and its speed relative to the Sun is not very high, it will never escape and
will describe an elliptic path about it. An example is the comet observed by Edmond
Halley in 1682 and now known as Halley’s comet. He computed its elliptic orbit, 
found that it was the same comet that had been seen in 1066, 1456, 1531 and 1607, and
correctly forecast its reappearance in 1758. It was most recently seen in 1986. If the
speed of the body is very high, its path will be deviated by the Sun but it will not orbit
forever around the Sun. Rather, it will bend around the Sun in a path in the form of a
hyperbola and continue on its journey back to outer space. Somewhere between these
two extremes there is a certain critical speed that is just too great to allow the body to

orbit the Sun, but not great enough for the path to be a hyperbola. In this case the path
is a parabola, and once again the body will bend around the Sun and continue on its
journey into outer space. These possibilities are illustrated in Figure 1.22.
Examples of where conic sections appear in engineering practice include the following.
(a) A parabolic surface, obtained by rotating a parabola about its axis of symmetry,
has the important property that an energy source placed at the focus will cause rays to
be reﬂected at the surface such that after reﬂection they will be parallel. Reversing the
process, a beam parallel to the axis impinging on the surface will be reﬂected onto 
the focus (Example 8.6). This property is involved in many engineering design pro-
jects: for example the design of a car headlamp or a radio telescope, as illustrated in
Figures 1.23(a) and (b) respectively. Other examples involving a parabola are the path
of a projectile (Example 2.39) and the shape of the cable on certain types of suspension
bridge (Example 8.60).
(b) A ray of light emitted from one focus of an elliptic mirror and reﬂected by the
mirror will pass through the other focus, as illustrated in Figure 1.24. This property is
sometimes used in designing mirror combinations for a reﬂecting telescope. Ellipses
have been used in other engineering designs, such as aircraft wings and stereo styli.
Elliptical pipes are used for foul and surface water drainage because the elliptical
proﬁle is hydraulically efﬁcient. As described earlier, every planet orbits around the
Sun in an elliptic path with the Sun at one of its foci. The planet’s speed depends on its
distance from the Sun; it speeds up as it nears the Sun and slows down as it moves fur-
ther away. The reason for this is that for an ellipse the line drawn from the focus S (Sun)
to a point P (planet) on the ellipse sweeps out areas at a constant rate as P moves around
the ellipse. Thus in Figure 1.25 the planet will take the same time to travel the two dif-
ferent distances shown, assuming that the two shaded regions are of equal area.
(c) Consider a supersonic aircraft ﬂying over land. As it breaks the sound barrier 
(that is, it travels faster than the speed of sound, which is about 750 mph (331.4 m s−1)),
it will create a shock wave, which we hear on the ground as a sonic boom – this being
one of the major disadvantages of supersonic aircraft. This shock wave will trail behind

the aircraft in the form of a cone with the aircraft as vertex. This cone will intersect the
ground in a hyperbolic curve, as illustrated in Figure 1.26. The sonic boom will hit
every point on this curve at the same instant of time, so that people living on the curve
will hear it simultaneously. No boom will be heard by people living outside this curve,
but eventually it will be heard at every point inside it.
Figure 1.20 illustrates the conics in their standard positions, and the corresponding
equations may be interpreted as the standard equations for the four curves. More gener-
ally the conic sections may be represented by the general second-order equation
ax2 + by2 + 2fx + 2gy + 2hxy + c = 0

The conics can be deﬁned mathematically in a number of (equivalent) ways, as we
will illustrate in the next examples.
Example 1.40
A point P moves in such a way that its total distance from two ﬁxed points A and B is
constant. Show that it describes an ellipse.
Solution
The deﬁnition of the curve implies that AP + BP = constant with the origin O being the
midpoint of AB. From symmetry considerations we choose x and y axes as shown in
Figure 1.27. Suppose the curve crosses the x axis at P0, then
AP0 + BP0 = AB + 2AP0 = 2OP0
so the constant in the deﬁnition is 2OP0 and for any point P on the curve
AP + BP = 2OP0
Let P = (x, y), P0 = (a, 0), P1 = (−a, 0), A = (c, 0) and B = (−c, 0). Then using Pythagoras’
theorem we have
AP = ÷[(x −c)2 + y2]
BP = ÷[(x + c)2 + y2]
so that the deﬁning equation of the curve becomes
÷[(x −c)2 + y2] + ÷[(x + c)2 + y2] = 2a
Figure 1.27
Path of Example 1.40.

1.4 GEOMETRY
45
To obtain the required equation we need to ‘remove’ the square root terms. This can
only be done by squaring both sides of the equation. First we rewrite the equation as
÷[(x −c)2 + y2] = 2a −÷[(x + c)2 + y2]
and then square to give
(x −c)2 + y2 = 4a2 −4a÷[(x + c)2 + y2] + (x + c)2 + y2
Expanding the squared terms we have
x2 −2cx + c2 + y2 = 4a2 −4a÷[(x + c)2 + y2] + x2 + 2cx + c2 + y2
Collecting together terms, we obtain
a÷[(x + c)2 + y2] = a2 + cx
Squaring both sides again gives
a2[x2 + 2cx + c2 + y2] = a4 + 2a2cx + c2x2
which simpliﬁes to
(a2 −c2)x2 + a2y2 = a2(a2 −c2)
Noting that a  c we write a2 −c2 = b2, to obtain
b2x2 + a2y2 = a2b2
which yields the standard equation of the ellipse
The points A and B are the foci of the ellipse, and the property that the sum of the focal
distances is a constant is known as the string property of the ellipse since it enables us
to draw an ellipse using a piece of string.
For a hyperbola, the difference of the focal distances is constant.
Example 1.41
A point moves in such a way that its distance from a ﬁxed point F is equal to its 
perpendicular distance from a ﬁxed line. Show that it describes a parabola.
Solution
Suppose the ﬁxed line is LL′ shown in Figure 1.28, choosing the co-ordinate axes shown.
Since PF = PN for points on the curve we deduce that the curve bisects FM, so that 
if F is (a, 0), then M is (−a, 0). Let the general point P on the curve have coordinates
(x, y). Then by Pythagoras’ theorem
PF = ÷[(x −a)2 + y2]
Also PN = x + a, so that PN = PF implies that
x + a = ÷[(x −a)2 + y2]
Squaring both sides gives

the standard equation of a parabola. The line LL′ is called the directrix of the parabola.

(a) Find the equation of the tangent at the point (1, 1) to the parabola y = x2. Show that
it is parallel to the line through the points ( , ), ( , ), which also lie on the parabola.
(b) Find the equation of the tangent at the point (a, a2) to the parabola y = x2. Show that
it is parallel to the line through the points (a −h, (a −h)2), (a + h, (a + h)2).
Solution
(a) Consider the general line through (1, 1). It has equation y = m(x −1) + 1. This cuts
the parabola when
m(x −1) + 1 = x2
that is, when
x2 −mx + m −1 = 0
Factorizing this quadratic, we have
(x −1)(x −m + 1) = 0
giving the roots x = 1 and x = m −1
These two roots are equal when m −1 = 1, that is, when m = 2. Hence the equation
of the tangent is y = 2x −1. 
The line through the points ( , ), ( , ) has gradient
so that it is parallel to the tangent at (1, 1).
(b) Consider the general line through (a, a2). It has equation y = m(x −a) + a2. This
cuts the parabola y = x2 when
m(x −a) + a2 = x2
that is, where
x2 −mx + ma −a2 = 0
This factorizes into
(x −a)(x −m + a) = 0
giving the roots x = a and x = m −a. These two roots are equal when a = m −a, that is,
when m = 2a. Thus the equation of the tangent at (a, a2) is y = 2ax −a2.

Number and accuracy
Arithmetic that only involves integers can be performed to obtain an exact answer 
(that is, one without rounding errors). In general, this is not possible with real numbers,
and when solving practical problems such numbers are rounded to an appropriate 
number of digits. In this section we shall review the methods of recording numbers,
obtain estimates for the effect of rounding errors in elementary calculations and discuss
the implementation of arithmetic on computers.
1.5.1
Rounding, decimal places and signiﬁcant ﬁgures
The Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic are, of course, independent of the choice of 
representation of the numbers. Similarly, the representation of irrational numbers will
always be incomplete. Because of these numbers and because some rational numbers have
recurring representations (whether the representation of a particular rational number is
recurring or not will of course depend on the number base used – see Example 1.2d),
any arithmetical calculation will contain errors caused by truncation. In practical problems
it is usually known how many ﬁgures are meaningful, and the numbers are ‘rounded’
accordingly. In the decimal representation, for example, the numbers are approximated
by the closest decimal number with some prescribed number of ﬁgures after the decimal
point. Thus, to two decimal places (dp),
π = 3.14
and
= 0.42
and to ﬁve decimal places
π = 3.141 59
and
= 0.416 67
Normally this is abbreviated to
π = 3.14159 (5dp)

Similarly
÷2 = 1.4142 (4dp)
and
= 0.667 (3dp)
In hand computation, by convention, when shortening a number ending with a ﬁve we
‘round to the even’. For example,
1.2345
and
1.2335
are both represented by 1.234 to three decimal places. In contrast, most calculators and
computers would ‘round up’ in the ambiguous case, giving 1.2345 and 1.2335 as 1.235
and 1.234 respectively.
Any number occurring in practical computation will either be given an error bound
or be correct to within half a unit in the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure (sf). For example
π = 3.14 ± 0.005
or
π = 3.14
Any number given in scientiﬁc or mathematical tables observes this convention. Thus
g0 = 9.806 65
implies
g0 = 9.806 65 ± 0.000 005
that is,
9.806 645  g0  9.806655
as illustrated in Figure 1.29.
Sometimes the decimal notation may create a false impression of accuracy. When
we write that the distance of the Earth from the Sun is ninety-three million miles, we
mean that the distance is nearer to 93 000 000 than to 94 000 000 or to 92 000 000, not
that it is nearer to 93000000 than to 93000001 or to 92999999. This possible mis-
interpretation of numerical data is avoided by either stating the number of signiﬁcant
ﬁgures, giving an error estimate or using scientiﬁc notation. In this example the dis-
tance d miles is given in the forms
d = 93000000 (2sf)
or
d = 93 000 000 ± 500 000
or
d = 9.3 × 107
Notice how information about accuracy is discarded by the rounding-off process. The value
ninety-three million miles is actually correct to within ﬁfty thousand miles, while the
convention about rounded numbers would imply an error bound of ﬁve hundred thousand.
The number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures tells us about the relative accuracy of a number
when it is related to a measurement. Thus a number given to 3sf is relatively ten times
more accurate than one given to 2sf. The number of decimal places, dp, merely tells us
the number of digits including leading zeros after the decimal point. Thus

2.321
and
0.000 059 71
both have 4sf, while the former has 3dp and the latter 8dp.
It is not clear how many signiﬁcant ﬁgures a number like 3200 has. It might be 2, 3
or 4. To avoid this ambiguity it must be written in the form 3.2 × 103 (when it is correct
to 2sf) or 3.20 × 103 (3sf) or 3.200 × 103 (4sf). This is usually called scientiﬁc notation.
It is widely used to represent numbers that are very large or very small. Essentially, a
number x is written in the form
x = a × 10n
where 1  | a |  10 and n is an integer. Thus the mass of an electron at rest is 9.11 ×
10−28g, while the velocity of light in a vacuum is 2.9978 × 1010 cms−1.

1.5.2
Estimating the effect of rounding errors
Numerical data obtained experimentally will often contain rounding errors due to 
the limited accuracy of measuring instruments. Also, because irrational numbers and 
some rational numbers do not have a terminating decimal representation, arithmetical
operations inevitably contain errors arising from rounding off. The effect of such errors
can accumulate in an arithmetical procedure and good engineering computations will
include an estimate for it. This process has become more important with the widespread
use of computers. When users are isolated from the computational chore, they often 
fail to develop a sense of the limits of accuracy of an answer. In this section we shall
develop the basic ideas for such sensitivity in analyses of calculations.
Example 1.44
Compute
(a) 3.142 + 4.126
(b) 5.164 −2.341
(c) 235.12 × 0.531
Calculate estimates for the effects of rounding errors in each answer and give the
answer as a correctly rounded number.

50
NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
Solution
(a) 3.142 + 4.126 = 7.268
Because of the convention about rounded numbers, 3.142 represents all the numbers a
between 3.1415 and 3.1425, and 4.126 represents all the numbers b between 4.1255 and
4.1265. Thus if a and b are correctly rounded numbers, their sum a + b lies between 
c1 = 7.2670 and c2 = 7.2690. Rounding c1 and c2 to 3dp gives c1 = 7.267 and c2 = 7.269.
Since these disagree, we cannot give an answer to 3dp. Rounding c1 and c2 to 2dp 
gives c1 = 7.27 and c2 = 7.27. Since these agree, we can give the answer to 2dp; thus 
a + b = 7.27, as shown in Figure 1.30.
(b) 5.164 −2.341 = 2.823
Applying the same ‘worst case’ analysis to this implies that the difference lies between
5.1635 −2.3415 and 5.1645 −2.3405, that is, between 2.8220 and 2.8240. Thus the
answer should be written 2.823 ± 0.001 or, as a correctly rounded number, 2.82.
(c) 235.12 × 0.531 = 124.84872
Clearly, writing an answer with so many decimal places is unjustiﬁed if we are using
rounded numbers, but how many decimal places are sensible? Using the ‘worst case’
analysis again, we deduce that the product lies between 235.115 × 0.5305 and 235.125
× 0.5315, that is, between c1 = 124.728 507 5 and c2 = 124.9689375. Thus the answer
should be written 124.85 ± 0.13. In this example, because of the place where the number
occurs on the number line, c1 and c2 only agree when we round them to 3sf (0dp). Thus
the product as a correctly rounded number is 125.
A competent computation will contain within it estimates of the effect of rounding
errors. Analysing the effect of such errors for complicated expressions has to be
approached systematically.
Deﬁnitions
(a) The error in a value is deﬁned by
error = approximate value −true value
This is sometimes termed the dead error. Notice that the true value equals the approxi-
mate value minus the error.
(b) Similarly the correction is deﬁned by
true value = approximate value + correction
so that
correction = −error
Figure 1.30

1.5 NUMBERS AND ACCURACY
51
(c) The error modulus is the size of the error, | error|, and the error bound (or 
absolute error bound) is the maximum possible error modulus.
(d) The relative error is the ratio of the size of the error to the size of the true value:
relative error =
The relative error bound is the maximum possible relative error.
(e) The per cent error (or percentage error) is 100 × relative error and the per cent
error bound is the maximum possible per cent error.
In some contexts we think of the true value as an approximation and a remainder. 
In such cases the remainder is given by
remainder = −error 
= correction
Example 1.45
Give the absolute and relative error bounds of the following correctly rounded numbers
(a) 29.92
(b) −0.01523
(c) 3.9 × 1010
Solution
(a) The number 29.92 is given to 2dp, which implies that it represents a number within
the domain 29.92 ± 0.005. Thus its absolute error bound is 0.005, half a unit of the least
signiﬁcant ﬁgure, and its relative error bound is 0.005/29.92 or 0.00017.
(b) The absolute error bound of −0.01523 is half a unit of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure,
that is, 0.000005. Notice that it is a positive quantity. Its relative error bound is
0.000 005/0.015 23 or 0.000 33.
(c) The absolute error bound of 3.9 × 1010 is 0.05 × 1010 = 5 × 108 and its relative error
bound is 0.05/3.9 or 0.013.
Usually, because we do not know the true values, we estimate the effects of error in 
a calculation in terms of the error bounds, the ‘worst case’ analysis illustrated in
Example 1.44. The error bound of a value v is denoted by εv.
Consider, ﬁrst, the sum c = a + b. When we add together the two rounded numbers
a and b their sum will inherit a rounding error from both a and b. The true value of a
lies between a −εa and a + εa and the true value of b lies between b −εb and b + εb.
Thus the smallest value that the true value of c can have is a −εa + b −εb, and its largest
possible value is a + εa + b + εb. (Remember that εa and εb are positive.) Thus c = a + b
has an error bound
εc = εa + εb
as illustrated in Figure 1.31. A similar ‘worst case’ analysis shows that the difference 
d = a −b has an error bound that is the sum of the error bounds of a and b:
d = a −b,
εd = εa + εb
error
value

52
NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
Thus for both addition and subtraction the error bound of the result is the sum of the
individual error bounds.
Next consider the product p = a × b, where a and b are positive numbers. The smallest
possible value of p will be equal to the product of the least possible values of a and b;
that is,
p  (a −εa) × (b −εb)
Similarly
p  (a + εa) × (b + εb)
Thus, on multiplying out the brackets, we obtain
ab −aεb −bεa + εaεb  p  ab + aεb + bεa + εaεb
Ignoring the very small term εaεb, we obtain an estimate for the error bound of the product:
εp = aεb + bεa,
p = a × b
Dividing both sides of the equation by p, we obtain
Now the relative error of a is deﬁned as the ratio of the error in a to the size of a. 
The above equation connects the relative error bounds for a, b and p:
rp = ra + rb
Here ra = εa/| a | allowing for a to be negative, and so on.
A similar worst case analysis for the quotient q = a/b leads to the estimate
rq = ra + rb
Thus for both multiplication and division, the relative error bound of the result is the
sum of the individual relative error bounds.
These elementary rules for estimating error bounds can be combined to obtain more
general results. For example, consider z = x2; then rz = 2rx. In general, if z = x y, where
x is a rounded number and y is exact, then
rz = yrx

Example 1.46
Evaluate 13.92 × 5.31 and 13.92 ÷ 5.31.
Assuming that these values are correctly rounded numbers, calculate error bounds 
for each answer and write them as correctly rounded numbers which have the greatest 
possible number of signiﬁcant digits.
Solution
13.92 × 5.31 = 73.9152; 13.92 ÷ 5.31 = 2.621 468 927
Let a = 13.92 and b = 5.31, then ra = 0.000 36 and rb = 0.000 94, so that a × b and 
a ÷ b have relative error bounds 0.00036 + 0.000 94 = 0.0013. We obtain the absolute
error bound of a × b by multiplying the relative error bound by a × b. Thus the 
absolute error bound of a × b is 0.0013 × 73.9152 = 0.0961. Similarly, the absolute error
bound of a ÷ b is 0.0013 × 2.6215 = 0.0034. Hence the values of a × b and a ÷ b lie in
the error intervals
73.9152 −0.0961  a × b  73.9152 + 0.0961
and
2.6215 −0.0034  a ÷ b  2.6215 + 0.0034
Thus 73.8191  a × b  74.0113 and 2.6181  a ÷ b  2.6249.
From these inequalities we can deduce the correctly rounded values of a × b and 
a ÷ b:
a × b = 74
and
a ÷ b = 2.62
and we see how the rounding convention discards information. In a practical context, it
would probably be more helpful to write:
73.81  a × b  74.02
and
2.618  a ÷ b  2.625

We calculate this as b × c = p, then p ÷ d = q and then a −q = e, as shown in Figure
1.32(a). We set this calculation out in a table as shown in Figure 1.32(b), where the
arrows show the ﬂow of the error analysis calculation. Thus the value of e lies between
2.790 235 … and 2.793 035… , and the answer may be written as 2.7916 ± 0.0015 or
as the correctly rounded number 2.79.
The calculations shown in Figure 1.32 indicate the way in which errors may accumu-
late in simple arithmetical calculations. The error bounds given are rarely extreme and
their behaviour is ‘random’. This is discussed later in Example 13.31 in the work on
Statistics.

Computer arithmetic
The error estimate outlined in Example 1.44 is a ‘worst case’ analysis. The actual error
will usually be considerably less than the error bound. For example, the maximum error
in the sum of 100 numbers, each rounded to three decimal places, is 0.05. This would
only occur in the unlikely event that each value has the greatest possible rounding error.
In contrast, the chance of the error being as large as one-tenth of this is only about 1 
in 20.
When calculations are performed on a computer the situation is modiﬁed a little by
the limited space available for number storage. Arithmetic is usually performed using
ﬂoating-point notation. Each number x is stored in the normal form
x = (sign)bn(a)
where b is the number base, usually 2 or 16, n is an integer, and the mantissa a is a
proper fraction with a ﬁxed number of digits such that 1/b  a  1. As there are a lim-
ited number of digits available to represent the mantissa, calculations will involve inter-
mediate rounding. As a consequence, the order in which a calculation is performed may

56
NUMBER, ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY
affect the outcome – in other words the Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic may no longer
hold! We shall illustrate this by means of an exaggerated example for a small com-
puter using a decimal representation whose capacity for recording numbers is limited
to four ﬁgures only. In large-scale calculations in engineering such considerations are
sometimes important.
Consider a computer with storage capacity for real numbers limited to four ﬁgures;
each number is recorded in the form (±)10 n(a) where the exponent n is an integer, 
0.1  a  1 and a has four digits. For example,
π = +101(0.3142)
= −100(0.3333)
5764 = +104(0.5764)
−0.000 971 3 = −10−3(0.9713)
5 764 213 = +107(0.5764)
Addition is performed by ﬁrst adjusting the exponent of the smaller number to that of
the larger, then adding the numbers, which now have the same multiplying power of 10,
and lastly truncating the number to four digits. Thus 7.182 + 0.05381 becomes
+101(0.7182) + 10−1(0.5381) = 101(0.7182) + 101(0.005381)
= 101(0.723581)
= 101(0.7236)
With a = 31.68, b = −31.54 and c = 83.21, the two calculations (a + b) + c and (a + c) + b
yield different results on this computer:
(a + b) + c = 83.35,
(a + c) + b = 83.34
Notice how the symbol ‘=’ is being used in the examples above. Sometimes it means
‘equals to 4sf’. This computerized arithmetic is usually called ﬂoating-point arithmetic,
and the number of digits used is normally speciﬁed.

Engineering applications
In this section we illustrate through two examples how some of the results developed
in this chapter may be used in an engineering application.
Example 1.48
A continuous belt of length L m passes over two wheels of radii r and R m with their
centres a distance l m apart, as illustrated in Figure 1.33. The belt is sufﬁciently tight for
any sag to be negligible. Show that L is given approximately by
L ≈2[l 2 −(R −r)2]1/2 + π(R + r)
Find the error inherent in this approximation and obtain error bounds for L given the
rounded data R = 1.5, r = 0.5 and l = 3.5.
Figure 1.33
Continuous belt of
Example 1.48.
Solution
The length of the belt consists of the straight sections AB and CD and the wraps round
the wheels n and o. From Figure 1.33 it is clear that BT = OP = l and ∠OAB is 
a right-angle. Also, AT = AO −OT and OT = PB so that AT = R −r. Applying
Pythagoras’ theorem to the triangle TAB gives
AB2 = l 2 −(R −r)2
Since the length of an arc of a circle is the product of its radius and the angle (measured
in radians) subtended at the centre (see 2.17), the length of wrap o is given by
(2π −2θ)R
where the angle is measured in radians. By geometry,
, so that
o = πR + 2Rα
Similarly, the arc n = πr −2rα. Thus the total length of the belt is
L = 2[l 2 −(R −r)2]1/2 + π(R + r) + 2(R −r)α
Taking the length to be given approximately by
L ≈2[l 2 −(R −r)2]1/2 + π(R + r)
the error of the approximation is given by −2(R −r)α, where the angle α is expressed
in radians (remember that error = approximation −true value). The angle α is found 
by elementary trigonometry, since sin α = (R −r)/l. (Trigonometric functions will be
reviewed in Section 2.6.)

For the (rounded) data given, we deduce, following the procedures of Section 1.5.2,
that for R = 1.5, r = 0.5 and l = 3.5 we have an error interval for α of
Thus α = 0.29 ± 0.035, and similarly 2(R −r)α = 0.572 ± 0.111.
Evaluating the approximation for L gives
2[l 2 −(R −r)2]1/2 + π(R + r) = 12.991 ± 0.478
and the corresponding value for L is
L = 13.563 ± 0.589
Thus, allowing for both the truncation error of the approximation and for the rounding
errors in the data, the value 12.991 given by the approximation has an error interval
[12.974, 14.152]. Its error bound is the larger of |12.991 −14.152| and |12.991 −12.974|,
that is, 1.16. Its relative error is 0.089 and its per cent error is 8.9%, where the termino-
logy follows the deﬁnitions given in Section 1.5.2.
Example 1.49
A cable company is to run an optical cable from a relay station, A, on the shore to an
installation, B, on an island, as shown in Figure 1.34. The island is 6km from the shore
at its nearest point, P, and A is 9km from P measured along the shore. It is proposed to
run the cable from A along the shoreline and then underwater to the island. It costs 25%
more to run the cable underwater than along the shoreline. At what point should the
cable leave the shore in order to minimize the total cost?

cable of Example 1.49.
Solution
Optimization problems frequently occur in engineering and technology and often their
solution is found algebraically.
If the cable leaves the shore at D, a distance x km from P, then the underwater 
distance is ÷(x2 + 36)km and the overland distance is (9 −x)km, assuming 0  x  9. If
the overland cost of laying the cable is £c per kilometre, then the total cost £C is given by
C(x) = [(9 −x) + 1.25÷(x2 + 36)]c

We wish to ﬁnd the value of x, 0  x  9, which minimizes C. To do this we ﬁrst
change the variable x by substituting
such that x2 + 36 becomes a perfect square:
x2 + 36 = 36 + 9(t2 −2 + 1/t2)
= 9(t + 1/t)2
Hence C(x) becomes
C(t) = [9 −3(t −1/t) + 3.75(t + 1/t)]c
= [9 + 0.75(t + 9/t)]c
Using the arithmetic–geometric inequality x + y  2÷(xy), see (1.4d), we know that
and that the equality occurs where t = 9/t, that is where t = 3.
Thus the minimum cost is achieved where t = 3 and x = 3(3 −1/3) = 8. Hence the
cable should leave the shore after laying the cable 1km from its starting point at A.

Introduction
As we have remarked in the introductory section of  Chapter 1, mathematics provides
a means of solving the practical problems that occur in engineering. To do this, it uses
concepts and techniques that operate on and within the concepts. In this chapter we
shall describe the concept of a function – a concept that is both fundamental to math-
ematics and is also intuitive. We shall make the intuitive idea mathematically precise 
by formal deﬁnitions and is also describe why such formalism is needed for practical
problem-solving.
The function concept has taken many centuries to evolve. The intuitive basis for 
the concept is found in the analysis of cause and effect, which underpins develop-
ments in science, technology and commerce. As with many mathematical ideas, many
people use the concept in their everyday activities without being aware that they are
using mathematics, and many would be surprised if they were told that they were. 
The abstract manner in which the developed form of the concept is expressed by 
mathematicians often intimidates learners but the essential idea is very simple. A 
consequence of the long period of development is that the way in which the concept 
is described often makes an idiomatic use of words. Ordinary words which in common
parlance have many different shades of meaning are used in mathematics with very
speciﬁc meanings.
The key idea is that of the values of two variable quantities being related. For 
example, the amount of tax paid depends on the selling price of an item; the deﬂection
of a beam depends on the applied load; the cost of an article varies with the number 
produced, and so on. Historically, this idea has been expressed in a number of ways.
The oldest gave a verbal recipe for calculating the required value. Thus, in the early
Middle Ages, a very elaborate verbal recipe was given for calculating the monthly
interest payments on a loan which would now be expressed very compactly by a single
formula. John Napier, when he developed the logarithm function at the beginning of 
the seventeenth century, expressed the functional relationship in terms of two particles
moving along a straight line. One particle moved with constant velocity and the other
with a velocity that depended on its distance from a ﬁxed point on the line. The relation-
ship between the distances travelled by the particles was used to deﬁne the logarithms
of numbers. This would now be described by the solution of a differential equation. The
introduction of algebraic notation led to the representation of functions by algebraic
rather than verbal formulae. That produced many theoretical problems. For example, a
considerable controversy was caused by Fourier when he used functions that did not
have the same algebraic formula for all values of the independent variable. Similarly,
the existence of functions that do not have a simple algebraic representation caused
considerable difﬁculties for mathematicians in the early nineteenth century.

2.2.1
Concept of a function
The essential idea that ﬂows through all of the developments is that of two quantities
whose values are related. One of these variables, the independent or free variable,

may take any value in a set of values. The value it actually takes ﬁxes uniquely the
value of the second quantity, the dependent or slave variable. Thus for each value of
the independent variable there is one and only one value of the dependent variable. 
The way in which that value is calculated will vary between functions. Sometimes it
will be by means of a formula, sometimes by means of a graph and sometimes by means
of a table of values. Here the words ‘value’ and ‘quantity’ cover many very different
contexts, but in each case what we have is two sets of values X and Y and a rule that
assigns to each value x in the set X precisely one value y from the set Y. The elements
of X and Y need not be numbers, but the essential idea is that to every x in the set X
there corresponds exactly one y in the set Y. Whenever this situation arises we say that 
there is a function f that maps the set X to the set Y. Such a function may be illustrated
schematically as in Figure 2.1.
We represent a functional relationship symbolically in two ways: either
f:x →y
(x in X)
or
y = f(x)
(x in X)
The ﬁrst emphasizes the fact that a function f associates each element (value) x of X
with exactly one element (value) y of Y: it ‘maps x to y’. The second method of nota-
tion emphasizes the dependence of the elements of Y on the elements of X under the
function f. In this case the value or variable appearing within the brackets is known 
as the argument of the function; we might say ‘the argument x of a function f(x)’. In
engineering it is more common to use the second notation y = f(x) and to refer to this
as the function f(x), while modern mathematics textbooks prefer the mapping notation,
on the grounds that it is less ambiguous. The set X is called the domain of the function
and the set Y is called its codomain. Knowing the domain and codomain is important
in computing. We need to know the type of variables, whether they are integers or reals,
and their size. When y = f(x), y is said to be the image of x under f. The set of all images
y = f(x), x in X, is called the image set or range of f. It is not necessary for all elements
y of the codomain set Y to be images under f. In the terminology of Chapter 6 the range
is a subset of the codomain. We may regard x as being a variable that can be replaced
by any element of the set X. The rule giving f is then completely determined if we know
f(x), and consequently in engineering it is common to refer to the function as being f(x)
rather than f. Likewise we can regard y = f(x) as being a variable. However, while x
can freely take any value from the set X, the variable y = f(x) depends on the particular
element chosen for x. We therefore refer to x as the free or independent variable and
to y as the slave or dependent variable. The function f(x) is therefore speciﬁed com-
pletely by the set of ordered pairs (x, y) for all x in X. For real variables a graphical 
representation of the function may then be obtained by plotting a graph determined 
by this set of ordered pairs (x, y), with the independent variable x measured along the
horizontal axis and the dependent variable y measured along the vertical axis. Obtaining
a good graph by hand is not always easy but there are now available excellent graphics
facilities on computers and calculators which assist in the task. Even so, some practice
is required to ensure that a good choice of ‘drawing window’ is selected to obtain a
meaningful graph.

Example 2.1
For the functions with formulae below, identify their domains, codomains and ranges
and calculate values of f(2), f(−3) and f(−x).
(a) f(x) = 3x2 + 1
(b) f:x →÷[(x + 4)(3 −x)]
Solution
(a) The formula for f(x) can be evaluated for all real values of x and so we can take a
domain which includes all the real numbers, RR. The values obtained are also real num-
bers, so we may take R as the codomain. The range of f(x) is actually less than RR in this
example because the minimum value of y = 3x2 + 1 occurs at y = 1 where x = 0. Thus
the range of f is the set
{x:1  x, x in R} = [1, ∞)
Notice the convention here that the set is speciﬁed using the dummy variable x. 
We could also write {y:1  y, y in R}, any letter could be used but conventionally x
is used. Using the formula we ﬁnd that f(2) = 13, f(−3) = 28 and f(−x) = 3(−x)2 + 1 =
3x2 + 1.
(b) The formula f:x →÷[(x + 4)(3 −x)] only gives real values for −4  x  3, since we
cannot take square roots of negative numbers. Thus the domain of f is [−4,3]. Within 
its domain the function has real values so that its codomain is R but its range is less 
than R. The least value of f occurs at x = −4 and x = 3 when f(−4) = f(3) = 0. The
largest value of f occurs at x =
when f(
) = ÷(35)/2.
So the range of f in this example is [0, ÷(35)/2]. Using the formula we have f(2) = ÷6,
f(−3) = ÷6, f(−x) = ÷[(4 −x)(x + 3)].
Example 2.2
The function y = f(x) is given by the minimum diameter y of a circular pipe that can
contain x circular pipes of unit diameter, where x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Find the domain,
codomain and range of f(x).
Solution
This function is illustrated in Figure 2.2.

Here the domain is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and the codomain is R. Calculating the 
range is more difﬁcult as there is not a simple algebraic formula relating x and y. From
geometry we have
f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1 + 2/÷3, f(4) = 1 + ÷2, f(5) =
÷[2(5 −÷5)], 
f(6) = 3, f(7) = 3
The range of f(x) is the set of these values.
Example 2.3
The relationship between the temperature T1 measured in degrees Celsius (°C) and the
corresponding temperature T2 measured in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) is
T2 =
T1 + 32
Interpreting this as a function with T1 as the independent variable and T2 as the 
dependent variable:
(a) What are the domain and codomain of the function?
(b) What is the function rule?
(c) Plot a graph of the function.
(d) What is the image set or range of the function?
(e) Use the function to convert the following into °F:
(i) 60°C,
(ii) 0°C,
(iii) −50°C
Solution
(a) Since temperature can vary continuously, the domain is the set T1  T0 = −273.16
(absolute zero). The codomain can be chosen as the set of real numbers .
(b) The function rule in words is
multiply by 
and then add 32
or algebraically
f(T1) =
T1 + 32
(c) Since the domain is the set T1  T0, there must be an image for every value of T1
on the horizontal axis which is greater than −273.16. The graph of the function is that
part of the line T2 =
T1 + 32 for which T1  −273.16, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.
(d) Since each value of T2 is an image of some value T1 in its domain, it follows that
the range of f(T1) is the set of real numbers greater than −459.69.
(e) The conversion may be done graphically by reading values of the graph, as illustrated
by the broken lines in Figure 2.3, or algebraically using the rule
T2 =
T1 + 32
giving the values
(i) 140°F,
(ii) 32°F,
(iii) −58°F

A value of the independent variable for which the value of a function is zero, is called
a zero of that function. Thus the function f(x) = (x −1)(x + 2) has two zeros, x = 1 and
x = −2. These correspond to where the graph of the function crosses the x axis, as shown
in Figure 2.4. We can see from the diagram that, for this function, its values decrease as
the values of x increase from (say) −5 up to 
, and then its values increase with x. We can
demonstrate this algebraically by rearranging the formula for f (x):
f(x) = (x −1)(x + 2)
= x2 + x −2
= (x +
)2 −
,
From this we can see that f(x) achieves its smallest value (−) where x =
and that the
value of the function is greater than −
both sides of x =
because (x + )2  0. The
function is said to be a decreasing function for x 
and an increasing function for
x 
. More formally, a function is said to be increasing on an interval (a, b) 
if f(x2)  f(x1) when x2  x1 for all x1 and x2 lying in (a, b). Similarly for decreasing
functions, we have f(x2)  f(x1) when x2  x1. 
The value of a function at the point where its behaviour changes from decreasing to
increasing is a minimum (plural minima) of the function. Often this is denoted by an
asterisk superscript f * and the corresponding value of the independent variable by x*
so that f(x*) = f *. Similarly a maximum (plural maxima) occurs when a function
changes from being increasing to being decreasing. In many cases the terms maximum
and minimum refer to the local values of the function, as illustrated in Example 2.4(a).
Sometimes, in practical problems, it is necessary to distinguish between the largest
value the function achieves on its domain and the local maxima it achieves elsewhere.
Similarly for local minima. Maxima and minima are jointly referred to as optimal 
values and as extremal values of the function. 
The point (x*, f *) of the graph of f(x) is often called a turning point of the graph,
whether it is a maximum or a minimum. These properties will be discussed in more
detail in Sections 8.2.7 and 8.5. For smooth functions as in Figure 2.5, the tangent to
the graph of the function is horizontal at a turning point. This property can be used to
locate maxima and minima.

Example 2.4
Draw graphs of the functions below, locating their zeros, intervals in which they are
increasing, intervals in which they are decreasing and their optimal values.
(a) y = 2x3 + 3x2 −12x + 32
(b) y = (x −1)2/3 −1
Solution
(a) The graph of the function is shown in Figure 2.5. From the graph we can see 
that the function has one zero at x = −4. It is an increasing function on the intervals 
−∞ x  −2 and 1  x  ∞and a decreasing function on the interval −2  x  1. 
It achieves a maximum value of 52 at x = −2 and a minimum value of 25 at x = 1. 
In this example the extremal values at x = −2 and x = 1 are local maximum and local
minimum values. The function is deﬁned on the set of real numbers R. Thus it does not
have ﬁnite upper and lower values. If the domain were restricted to [−4, 4], say, then 
the global minimum would be f(−4) = 0 and the global maximum would be f(4) = 160.

(b) The graph of the function is shown in Figure 2.6. (Note that to evaluate (x −1)2/3
on some calculators/computer packages it has to be expressed as ((x −1)2)1/3 for x  1.)

From the graph, we see that the function has two zeros, one at x = 0 and the other
at x = 2. It is a decreasing function for x  1 and an increasing function for x  1. 
This is obvious algebraically since (x −1)2/3 is greater than or equal to zero. This
example also provides an illustration of the behaviour of some algebraic functions at 
a maximum or minimum value. In contrast to (a) where the function changes from
decreasing to increasing at x = 1 quite smoothly, in this case the function changes 
from decreasing to increasing abruptly at x = 1. Such a minimum value is called a 
cusp. In this example, the value at x = 1 is both a local minimum and a global 
minimum.
It is important to appreciate the difference between a function and a formula. A 
function is a mapping that associates one and only one member of the codomain with
every member of its domain. It may be possible to express this association, as in
Example 2.3, by a formula. Some functions may be represented by different formulae
on different parts of their domain.
Example 2.5
A gas company charges its industrial users according to their gas usage. Their tariff is
as follows:
Quarterly usage/103 units

What is the quarterly charge paid by a user?
Solution
The charge £c paid by a user for a quarter’s gas is a function, since for any number 
of units used there is a unique charge. The charging tariff is expressed in terms of the
number u of thousands of units of gas consumed. In this situation the independent 
variable is the gas consumption u since that determines the charge £c which accrues to
the customer. The function f: usage →cost must, however, be expressed in the form 
c = f(u), where
Functions that are represented by different formulae on different parts of their domains
arise frequently in engineering and management applications.

The basic MATLAB package is primarily a number crunching package. It does 
not perform symbolic manipulations and cannot undertake algebra containing
unknowns. However, such work can be undertaken by the Symbolic Math Toolbox,
which incorporates many MAPLE commands to implement the algebraic work.
Consequently, most of the commands in Symbolic Math Toolbox are identical to 
the MAPLE commands. In order to use any symbolic variables, such as x and y, 
in MATLAB these must be declared by entering a command, such as syms x y;.
MAPLE does not need to construct symbols since these are assumed in the 
package. Another important difference is that in MAPLE assignment is performed
by := rather than = and each statement must end with a semicolon ‘;’. In MATLAB
inserting a semicolon at the end of a statement suppresses display on screen of the
output to the command. In MAPLE output to the screen is suppressed using ‘:’. 
In this chapter, only MATLAB versions of any process are given since a MAPLE
user can easily adapt the codes. If there are signiﬁcant syntax differences these 
will be noted.
The MATLAB operators for the basic arithmetic operations are + for addition, 
- for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division and ^ for power. The colon
command x = a:dx:b generates an array of numbers which are the values of x
between a and b in steps of dx. For example, the command
x = 0:0.1:1
generates the array
x = 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
When using the operations of multiplication, division and power on such arrays *, /
and ^ are replaced respectively by .*, ./ and .^ in which the ‘dot’ implies element
by element operations. For example, if x = [1 2 3] and y = [4 −3 5] are two arrays
then x.*y denotes the array [4 −6 15] and x.^2 denotes the array [1 4 9]. Note that
to enter an array it must be enclosed within square brackets [ ].
To plot the graph of y = f(x), a  x  b, an array of x values is ﬁrst produced and
then a corresponding array of y values is produced. Then the command plot(x,y)
plots a graph of y against x. Check that the sequence of commands
x = -5:0.1:3;
y = 2*x.^3 + 3*x.^2 – 12*x + 32;
plot(x,y)
plots the graph of Figure 2.5. Entering a further command
grid
draws gridlines on the existing plot. The following commands may be used for
labelling the graph:
title(‘text’)
prints ‘text’ at the top of the plot
xlabel(‘text’) labels the x-axis with ‘text’
ylabel(‘text’) labels the y-axis with ‘text’

Plotting the graphs of y1 = f(x) and y2 = g(x), a  x  b, can be achieved using the
commands
x = [a:dx:b]’; y1 = f(x); y2 = g(x);
plot(x,y1, ‘-’,x,y2, ‘- -’)
with ‘-’ and ‘- -’ indicating that the graph of y1 = f(x) will appear as a ‘solid line’
and that of y2 = g(x) as a ‘dashed line’. These commands can be extended to include
more than two graphs as well as colour. To ﬁnd out more, use the help facility in
MATLAB.
Using the Symbolic Math Toolbox the sym command enables us to construct
symbolic variables and expressions. For example
x = sym(‘x’)
creates the variable x, that prints as x; whilst the command
f = sym(‘2*x + 3’)
assigns the symbolic expression 2x + 3 to the variable f. If f includes parameters then
these must be declared as symbolic terms at the outset. For example, the sequence
of commands
syms x a b
f = sym(‘a*x + b’)
prints
f = ax + b
(Note the use of spacing when specifying variables under syms.)
The command ezplot(y) produces the plot of y = f(x), making a reasonable
choice for the range of the x axis and resulting scale of the y axis, the default domain
of the x axis being −2π  x  2π. The domain can be changed to a  x  b using
the command ezplot(y,[a,b]). Check that the commands
syms x
y = sym(2*x^3 + 3*x^2 - 12*x + 32);
ezplot(y,[-5,3])
reproduce the graph of Figure 2.5 and that the commands
syms x
y = sym(((x - 1)^2)^(1/3) – 1)
ezplot(y,[-5,3])
reproduce the graph of Figure 2.6. (Note that in the second case the function is
expressed in the form indicated in the solution to Example 2.4(b).)
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are
y: = f(x);
plot(y,x = a..b);

2.2.3
Inverse functions
In some situations we may need to use the functional dependence in the reverse sense.
For example we may wish to use the function
T2 = f(T1) =
+ 32
(2.1)
of Example 2.3, relating T2 in °F to the corresponding T1 in °C to convert degrees
Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. In this simple case we can rearrange the relationship
(2.1) algebraically
T1 =
(T2 −32)
giving us the function
T1 = g(T2) = 
(T2 −32)
(2.2)
having T2 as the independent variable and T1 as the dependent variable. We may then
use this to convert degrees Fahrenheit into degrees Celsius.
Looking more closely at the two functions f(T1) and g(T2) associated with (2.1) and
(2.2), we have the function rule for f(T1) as
multiply by and then add 32
If we reverse the process, we have the rule
take away 32 and then multiply by
which is precisely the function rule for g(T2). Thus the function T1 = g(T2) reverses 
the operations carried out by the function T2 = f(T1), and for this reason is called the
inverse function of T2 = f(T1).
In general, the inverse function of a function f is a function that reverses the 
operations carried out by f. It is denoted by f −1. Writing y = f(x), the function f may 
be represented by the block diagram of Figure 2.10(a), which indicates that the 
function operates on the input variable x to produce the output variable y = f(x). The
inverse function f −1 will reverse the process, and will take the value of y back to 
the original corresponding values of x. It can be represented by the block diagram of
Figure 2.10(b).

We therefore have
x = f −1(y),
where y = f(x)
(2.3)
that is, the independent variable x for f acts as the dependent variable for f −1, and 
correspondingly the dependent variable y for f becomes the independent variable for 
f −1. At the same time the range of f becomes the domain of f −1 and the domain of f
becomes the range of f −1.
Since it is usual to denote the independent variable of a function by x and the 
dependent variable by y, we interchange the variables x and y in (2.3) and deﬁne 
the inverse function by
if y = f −1(x)
then x = f( y)
(2.4)
Again in engineering it is common to denote an inverse function by f −1(x) rather than
f −1. Writing x as the independent variable for both f(x) and f −1(x) sometimes leads to
confusion, so you need to be quite clear as to what is meant by an inverse function. 
It is also important not to confuse f −1(x) with [ f(x)]−1, which means 1/f(x).
Finding an explicit formula for f −1(x) is often impossible and its values are calcu-
lated by special numerical methods. Sometimes it is possible to ﬁnd the formula for 
f −1(x) by algebraic methods. We illustrate the technique in the next two examples.
Example 2.6
Obtain the inverse function of the real function y = f(x) =
(4x −3).
Solution
Here the formula for the inverse function can be found algebraically. First rearranging
y = f(x) =
(4x −3)
to express x in terms of y gives
x = f −1( y) =
(5y + 3)
Interchanging the variables x and y then gives
y = f −1(x) =
(5x + 3)
as the inverse function of
y = f(x) =
(4x −3)
As a check, we have
f(2) =
(4 × 2 −3) = 1
while
f −1(1) =
(5 × 1 + 3) = 2

Example 2.7
Obtain the inverse function of
x ≠−1.
Solution
We rearrange 
to obtain x in terms of y. (Notice that y is not deﬁned where
x = −1.) Thus
y(x + 1) = x + 2
so that
x(y −1) = 2 −y
giving
y ≠1 (Notice that x is not deﬁned where y = 1. Putting y = 1 into 
the formula for y results in the equation x + 1 = x + 2 which is not possible.)
Thus
x ≠1
If we are given the graph of y = f(x) and wish to obtain the graph of the inverse func-
tion y = f −1(x) then what we really need to do is interchange the roles of x and y. Thus
we need to manipulate the graph of y = f(x) so that the x and y axes are interchanged.
This can be achieved by taking the mirror image in the line y = x and relabelling the
axes as illustrated in Figures 2.11(a) and (b). It is important to recognize that the graphs of
y = f(x) and y = f −1(x) are symmetrical about the line y = x, since this property is frequently
used in mathematical arguments. Notice that the x and y axes have the same scale.

illustrated in black in Figure 2.12(b).
(c) The graph of y = x2 is shown in Figure 2.13(a). Its mirror image in the line y = x
gives the graph of Figure 2.13(b). We note that this graph is not representative of a
function according to our deﬁnition, since for all values of x  0 there are two images
– one positive and one negative – as indicated by the broken line. This follows because
y = x2 corresponds to x = +÷y or x = −÷y. In order to avoid this ambiguity, we deﬁne
the inverse function of f(x) = x2 to be f −1(x) = +÷x, which corresponds to the upper half
of the graph as illustrated in Figure 2.13(c). ÷x therefore denotes a positive number 
(cf. calculators), so the range of ÷x is x  0. Thus the inverse function of y = f(x) = x2
(x  0) is y = f −1(x) = ÷x. Note that the domain of f(x) had to be restricted to x  0 
in order that an inverse could be deﬁned. In modern usage, the symbol ÷x denotes a 
positive number.

We see from Example 2.8(c) that there is no immediate inverse function correspond-
ing to f(x) = x2. This arises because for the function f(x) = x2 there is a codomain 
element that is the image of two domain elements x1 and −x1, as indicated by the 
broken arrowed lines in Figure 2.13(a). That is, f(x1) = f(−x1) = y1. If a function y = f(x)
is to have an immediate inverse f −1(x), without any imposed conditions, then every
element of its range must occur precisely once as an image under f(x). Such a function
is known as one-to-one (1:1) function.
2.2.4
Composite functions
In many practical problems the mathematical model will involve several different 
functions. For example, the kinetic energy T of a moving particle is a function of its
velocity v, so that
T = f(v)
Also, the velocity v itself is a function of time t, so that
v = g(t)
Clearly, by eliminating v, it is possible to express the kinetic energy as a function of
time according to
T = f(g(t))
A function of the form y = f(g(x)) is called a function of a function or a composite
of the functions f(x) and g(x). In modern mathematical texts it is common to denote 
the composite function by f ° g so that
y = f ° g(x) = f(g(x))
(2.5)
We can represent the composite function (2.5) schematically by the block diagram of
Figure 2.14, where u = g(x) is called the intermediate variable.
It is important to recognize that the composition of functions is not in general 
commutative. That is, for two general functions f(x) and g(x)
f(g(x)) ≠g( f(x))
Algebraically, given two functions y = f(x) and y = g(x), the composite function 
y = f(g(x)) may be obtained by replacing x in the expression for f(x) by g(x). Likewise,
the composite function y = g( f(x)) may be obtained by replacing x in the expression 
for g(x) by f(x).

Example 2.9
If y = f(x) = x2 + 2x and y = g(x) = x −1, obtain the composite functions f(g(x)) and
g( f(x)).
Solution
To obtain f(g(x)), replace x in the expression for f(x) by g(x), giving
y = f(g(x)) = (g(x))2 + 2(g(x))
But g(x) = x −1, so that
y = f(g(x)) = (x −1)2 + 2(x −1)
= x2 −2x + 1 + 2x −2
That is,
f(g(x)) = x2 −1
Similarly,
y = g( f(x)) = ( f(x)) −1
= (x2 + 2x) −1
That is,
g( f(x)) = x2 + 2x −1
Note that this example conﬁrms the result that in general f(g(x)) ≠g( f(x)).
Given a function y = f(x), two composite functions that occur frequently in engineering
are
y = f(x + k)
and
y = f(x −k)
where k is a positive constant. As illustrated in Figures 2.15(b) and (c), the graphs of
these two composite functions are readily obtained given the graph of y = f(x) as in
Figure 2.15(a). The graph of y = f(x −k) is obtained by displacing the graph of y = f(x)
by k units to the right, while the graph of y = f(x + k) is obtained by displacing the graph
of y = f(x) by k units to the left.
Viewing complicated functions as composites of simpler functions often enables us
to ‘get to the heart’ of a practical problem, and to obtain and understand the solution.
For example, recognizing that y = x2 + 2x −3 is the composite function y = (x + 1)2 −4,
tells us that the function is essentially the squaring function. Its graph is a parabola 
with minimum point at x = −1, y = −4 (rather than at x = 0, y = 0). A similar process of

f(x −k) and f(x + k),

reducing a complicated problem to a simpler one occurred in the solution of the prac-
tical problem discussed in Example 1.49 on p. 58.
Example 2.10
An open conical container is made from a sector of a circle of radius 10cm as illustrated
in Figure 2.16, with sectional angle θ (radians). The capacity C cm3 of the cone depends
on θ. Find the algebraic formula for C in terms of θ and the simplest associated func-
tion that could be studied if we wish to maximize C with respect to θ.
Solution
Let the cone have base radius r cm and height h cm. Then its capacity is given by 
C =
with r and h dependent upon the sectorial angle θ (since the perimeter of 
the sector has to equal the circumference of the base of the cone). Thus, by Pythagoras’
theorem,
10θ = 2πr
and
h2 = 102 −r2
so that

Setting x 2(1 −x) =
gives 27x 3 −27x 2 + 4 = 0 which factorizes into
(3x −2)2(3x + 1) = 0
Thus the equation has a double root at x =
and a single root at x = −. Thus E(x) has 
a maximum at x =
and the corresponding optimal value of θ is 2π÷( ). (In Section 8.5
(see also Question 5 in Review Exercises 8.13) we shall consider theoretical methods
of conﬁrming such results.)
When we compose a function with its inverse function, we usually obtain the identity
function y = x. Thus from Example 2.6, we have
f(x) =
(4x −3)
and
f −1(x) =
(5x + 3)
and
f( f −1(x)) =
{4[ (5x + 3)] −3} = x
and
f −1( f(x)) =
{5[ (4x −3)] + 3} = x
We need to take care with the exceptional cases that occur, like the square root function,
where the inverse function is deﬁned only after restricting the domain of the original
function. Thus for f(x) = x2 (x  0) and f −1(x) = ÷x (x  0), we obtain
f( f −1(x)) = x,

Odd, even and periodic functions
Some commonly occurring functions in engineering contexts have the special properties
of oddness or evenness or periodicity. These properties are best understood from the
graphs of the functions.
An even function is one that satisﬁes the functional equation
f(−x) = f(x)
Thus the value of f(−2) is the same as f(2), and so on. The graph of such a function is
symmetrical about the y axis, as shown in Figure 2.18.
In contrast, an odd function has a graph which is antisymmetrical about the origin,
as shown in Figure 2.19, and satisﬁes the equation
f(−x) = −f(x)
We notice that f(0) = 0 or is undeﬁned.
Polynomial functions like y = x 4 −x 2 −1, involving only even powers of x, are 
examples of even functions, while those like y = x −x 5, involving only odd powers of
x, provide examples of odd functions. Of course, not all functions have the property 
of oddness or evenness.

of period P.
(c) The graph is neither symmetrical nor antisymmetrical about the origin, so the 
function it represents is neither odd nor even.
(d) The graph is symmetrical about the y axis so it is an even function.
(e) The graph is neither symmetrical nor antisymmetrical about the origin, so it is 
neither an even nor an odd function.
(f) The graph is antisymmetrical about the origin, so it represents an odd function.
A periodic function is such that its image values are repeated at regular intervals in 
its domain. Thus the graph of a periodic function can be divided into ‘vertical strips’
that are replicas of each other, as shown in Figure 2.22. The width of each strip is called
the period of the function. We therefore say that a function f(x) is periodic with period
P if for all its domain values x
f(x + nP) = f(x)
for any integer n.
Solution
(a) The graph for x  0 is the mirror image of the graph for x  0 when the mirror is
placed on the y axis. Thus the graph represents an even function.
(b) The mirror image of the graph for x  0 in the y axis is shown in Figure 2.21(a). Now
reﬂecting that image in the x axis gives the graph shown in Figure 2.21(b). Thus Figure
2.20(b) represents an odd function since its graph is antisymmetrical about the origin.

2.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS
85
To provide a measure of the number of repetitions per unit of x, we deﬁne the 
frequency of a periodic function to be the reciprocal of its period, so that
The Greek letter ν (‘nu’) is usually used to denote the frequency, so that ν = 1/P. The
term circular frequency is also used in some engineering contexts. This is denoted by
the Greek letter ω (‘omega’) and is deﬁned by
It is measured in radians per unit of x, the free variable. When the meaning is clear from
the context the adjective ‘circular’ is commonly omitted.

(a) f(x) is periodic with period 1;

obtain the graph of f(x) between −1 and 0 by reﬂecting in the y axis, as shown in 
Figure 2.25(a). Thus we have the graph over a complete period, from −1 to +1, and 
so we can replicate along the x axis, as shown in Figure 2.25(b).
(c) Similarly, if f(x) is an odd function we can obtain the graph for the interval [−1, 0]
using antisymmetry and the graph for the interval [0, 1]. This gives us Figure 2.26(a)
and we then obtain the whole graph, Figure 2.26(b), by periodic extension.

Linear and quadratic functions
Among the more commonly used functions in engineering contexts are the linear and
quadratic functions. This is because the mathematical models of practical problems
often involve linear functions and also because more complicated functions are often well
approximated locally by linear or quadratic functions. We will review the properties of
these functions and in the process describe some of the contexts in which they occur.
2.3.1
Linear functions
The linear function is the simplest function that occurs in practical problems. It
has the formula f(x) = mx + c where m and c are constant numbers and x is the 
unassigned or independent variable as usual. The graph of f(x) is the set of points (x, y)
where y = mx + c, which is the equation of a straight line on a cartesian coordinate 
plot (see Section 1.4.2). Hence, the function is called the linear function. An example 
of a linear function is the conversion of a temperature T1 °C to the temperature 
T2°F. Here
16
Show that
h(x) =
[f(x) −f(−x)]
is an odd function and that any function f(x) may be
written as the sum of an odd and an even function.
Illustrate this result with f(x) = (x −1)3.

FUNCTIONS
T2 =
T1 + 32
and m =
with c = 32.
To determine the formula for a particular linear function the two constants m and c
have to be found. This implies that we need two pieces of information to determine f(x).
Example 2.13
A manufacturer produces 5000 items at a total cost of £10000 and sells them at £2.75
each. What is the manufacturer’s proﬁt as a function of the number x of items sold?
Solution
Let the manufacturer’s proﬁt be £P. If x items are sold then the total revenue is £2.75x,
so that the amount of proﬁt P(x) is given by
P(x) = revenue −cost = 2.75x −10 000
Here the domain of the function is [0, 5000] and the range is [−10 000, 3750]. This
function has a zero at 
. Thus to make a proﬁt, the manufacturer has to sell
more than 3636 items. (Note the modelling approximation in that, strictly, x is an 
integer variable, not a general real variable.)
If we know the values that the function f(x) takes at two values, x0 and x1, of the inde-
pendent variable x we can ﬁnd the formula for f(x). Let f(x0) = f0 and f(x1) = f1, then
(2.6)
This formula is known as Lagrange’s formula. It is obvious that the function is linear
since we can arrange it as
The reader should verify from (2.6) that f(x0) = f0 and f(x1) = f1.
Example 2.14
Use Lagrange’s formula to ﬁnd the linear function f(x) where f(10) = 1241 and
f(15) = 1556.
Solution
Taking x0 = 10 and x1 = 15 so that f0 = 1241 and f1 = 1556 we obtain
=
(1556 −1241) + 3(1241) −2(1556)

2.3 LINEAR AND QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS

The rate of change of a function, between two values x = x0 and x = x1 in its domain,
is deﬁned by the ratio of the change in the values of the function to the change in the
values of x. Thus
For a linear function with formula f(x) = mx + c we have
=
which is a constant. If we know the rate of change m of a linear function f(x) and the
value f0 at a point x = x0, then we can write the formula for f(x) as
f(x) = mx + f0 −mx0
For a linear function, the slope (gradient) of the graph is the rate of change of the function.
Example 2.15
The labour cost of producing a certain item is £21 per 10000 items and the raw 
materials cost is £4 for 1000 items. Each time a new production run is begun, there is
a set-up cost of £8. What is the cost, £C(x), of a production run of x items?
Solution
Here the cost function has a rate of change comprising the labour cost per item
(21/10000) and the materials cost per item (4/1000). Thus the rate of change is 0.0061.
We also know that if there is a production run with zero items, there is still a set-up 
cost of £8 so f(0) = 8. Thus the required function is
C(x) = 0.0061x + 8
2.3.2
Least squares ﬁt of a linear function to experimental data
Because the linear function occurs in many mathematical models of practical problems,
we often have to ‘ﬁt’ linear functions to experimental data. That is, we have to ﬁnd the
values of m and c which yield the best overall description of the data. There are two dis-
tinct mathematical models that occur. These are given by the functions with formulae
(a) y = ax
and
(b) y = mx + c
For example, the extension of an ideal spring under load may be represented by a 
function of type (a), while the velocity of a projectile launched vertically may be 
represented by a function of type (b).
From experiments we obtain a set of data points (xk, yk), k = 1, 2, … , n. We wish 
to ﬁnd the value of the constant(s) of the linear function that best describes the 
phenomenon the data represents.

Case (a): the theoretical model has the form y = ax
The difference between theoretical value axk and the experimental value yk at xk is 
(axk −yk). This is the ‘error’ of the model at x = xk. We deﬁne the value of a for which
y = ax best represents the data to be that value which minimizes the sum S of the
squared errors:
(Hence the name ‘least squares ﬁt’: the squares of the errors are chosen to avoid simple
cancellation of two large errors of opposite sign.)
It is easy to ﬁnd the minimizing value of a since S is essentially a quadratic expres-
sion in a. (All the xk’s and yk’s are numbers.) Rewriting, we have
(Notice the ‘taking out’ of the common factors a2 and −2a in these sums.) Writing
we have

Thus S is minimized when

Now completing the square with the remaining terms involving m we have
S = n(c −y + mx)2 + p(m −q/p)2 + r −q2/p
where
Thus S is minimized where

To avoid loss of signiﬁcance, the formula for m is usually expressed in the form
(2.9)
We can observe that in this case the best straight line passes through the average data
point (x, y), and the best straight line has the formula
y = mx + c
with c = y −mx.

and hence c = 1.8 −0.5(2) = 0.8.
Thus the best straight line ﬁt to the data is provided by y = 0.5x + 0.8.
See page 109 for MATLAB commands to reproduce the answer.
The formula for case (b) is the one most commonly given on calculators and in com-
puter packages (where it is called linear regression). It is important to have a theore-
tical justiﬁcation to ﬁtting data to a function, otherwise it is easy to produce nonsense.
For example, the data in Example 2.16 actually related to the extension of a soft spring
under a load, so that it would be inappropriate to ﬁt that data to y = mx + c. A non-zero
value for c would imply an extension with zero load! A little care is needed when using
computer packages. Some use the form y = ax + b and others the form y = a + bx as the
basic formula.

2.3.4
The quadratic function
The general quadratic function has the form
f(x) = ax2 + bx + c
where a, b and c are constants and a ≠0. By ‘completing the square’ we can show that
(see Example 1.15)
(2.10)
which implies that the graph of f(x) is either a ‘cup’ (a  0) or a ‘cap’ (a  0), as shown
in Figure 2.33, and is a parabola.
We can see that, because the quadratic function has three constants, to determine a
speciﬁc quadratic function requires three data points. The formula for the quadratic
function f(x) taking the values f0, f1, f2 at the values x0, x1, x2, of the independent 
variable x, may be written in Lagrange’s form:
(2.11)
The right-hand side of this formula is clearly a quadratic function. The reader should
spend a few minutes verifying that inserting the values x = x0, x1 and x2 yields f(x0) = f0,
f(x1) = f1 and f(x2) = f2.

Example 2.18
Find the formula of the quadratic function which satisﬁes the data points (1, 2), (2, 4)

Solution
Choose x0 = 1, x1 = 2 and x2 = 3 so that f0 = 2, f1 = 4 and f2 = 8. Then using Lagrange’s
formula (2.10) we have

= (x −2)(x −3) −4(x −1)(x −3) + 4(x −1)(x −2) = x2 −x + 2
Lagrange’s formula is not always the best way to obtain the formula of a quadratic
function. Sometimes we wish to obtain the formula as an expansion about a speciﬁc
point, as illustrated in Example 2.19.
Example 2.19
Find the quadratic function in the form
f(x) = A(x −2)2 + B(x −2) + C
which satisﬁes f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 8.
Solution
Setting x = 1, 2 and 3 into the formula for f(x) we obtain
f(1): A −B + C = 2
f(2):
C = 4
f(3): A + B + C = 8
from which we quickly ﬁnd A = 1, B = 3 and C = 4. Thus
f(x) = (x −2)2 + 3(x −2) + 4
The way we express the quadratic function depends on the problem context. The
form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c is convenient for values of x near x = 0, while the form 
f(x) = A(x −x0)2 + B(x −x0) + C is convenient for values of x near x = x0. (The second
form here is sometimes called the Taylor expansion of f(x) about x = x0.) This is dis-
cussed for the general function in Section 9.4, where we make use of the differential
calculus to obtain the expansion.
Since we can write f(x) in the form (2.10), we see that when b2  4ac we can 
factorize f(x) into the product of two linear factors and f(x) has two zeros given as 
in (1.8) by
When b2  4ac, f(x) cannot be factorized and does not have a zero. In this case it is
called an irreducible quadratic function.
Example 2.20
Complete the squares of the following quadratics and specify which are irreducible.
(a) y = x2 + x + 1

Solution
(a) In this case, a = b = c = 1 so that b2 −4ac = −3  0 and we deduce that the quadratic
is irreducible. Alternatively, using the method of completing the square we have
Since this is a sum of squares, like A2 + B2, it cannot, unlike a difference of squares, 
A2 −B2 = (A −B)(A + B), be factorized. Thus this is an irreducible quadratic function.
(b) Here a = 3, b = −2 and c = −1, so that b2 −4ac = 16  0 and we deduce that this is
not an irreducible quadratic. Alternatively, completing the square we have
y = 3x2 −2x −1 = 3(x2 −
x −
)
= 3[(x −
)2 −
] = 3[(x −
) −
][(x −
) +
]
= 3[x −1][x +
] = (x −1)(3x + 1)
Thus this is not an irreducible quadratic function.
(c) Here a = −1, b = 3 and c = 4, so that b2 −4ac = 25  0 and we deduce that the
quadratic is irreducible. Alternatively, completing the square we have
y = 4 + 3x −x2 = 4 +
−(x −
)2
=
−(x −
)2 = [
−(x −
)][
+ (x −
)]
= (4 −x)(1 + x)
Thus y is a product of two linear factors and 4 + 3x −x2 is not an irreducible quadratic
function.
(d) Here a = −2, b = 2 and c = −1, so that b2 −4ac = −4  0 and we deduce that the
quadratic is irreducible. Alternatively we may complete the square
y = 2x −1 −2x2 = −1 −2(x2 −x)
= −1 +
−2(x −
)2 = −
−2(x −
)2
= −2[
+ (x −
)2]
Since the term inside the square brackets is the sum of squares, we have an irreducible
quadratic function.
The quadratic function
f(x) = ax2 + bx + c
has a maximum when a  0 and a minimum when a  0, as illustrated earlier in 
Figure 2.33. The position and value of that extremal point (that is, of the maximum 
or the minimum) can be obtained from the completed square form (2.10) of f(x). 
These occur where
Thus, when a  0, f(x) has a minimum value (4ac −b2)/(4a) where x = −b/(2a).
When a  0, f(x) has a maximum value (4ac −b2)/(4a) at x = −b/(2a). 
This result is important in engineering contexts when we are trying to optimize costs
or proﬁts or to produce an optimal design (see Section 2.10).

(d) y = 2x −1 −2x2
Solution
This uses the completed squares of Example 2.20.
(a) y = x2 + x + 1 = (x +

Clearly the smallest value y can take is 
and this occurs when x +
= 0; that is, when
x = −.
(b) y = 3x2 −2x −1 = 3(x −

Clearly the smallest value of y occurs when x =

(c) y = 4 + 3x −x2 =

Clearly the largest value y can take is 
and this occurs when x =

(d) y = 2x −1 −2x2 = −

Thus the maximum value of y equals −

Conﬁrm that these results conform with the theory above.

A car travelling at u mph has to make an emergency
stop. There is an initial reaction time T1 before the
driver applies a constant braking deceleration of a
mph2. After a further time T2 the car comes to rest.
Show that T2 = u/a and that the average speed
during the braking period is u/2. Hence show that
the total stopping distance D may be expressed 
in the form
D = Au + Bu2
where A and B depend on T1 and a.
The stopping distances for a car travelling 
at 20 mph and 40 mph are 40 feet and 120 feet
respectively. Estimate the stopping distance for 
a car travelling at 70 mph.
A driver sees a hazard 150 feet ahead. What is
the maximum possible speed of the car at that
moment if a collision is to be avoided?

Polynomial functions
A polynomial function has the general form
f(x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + … + a1x + a0,
x in 
(2.12)
where n is a positive integer and ar is a real number called the coefﬁcient of xr, 
r = 0, 1, … , n. The index n of the highest power of x occurring is called the degree of
the polynomial. For n = 1 we obtain the linear function
f(x) = a1x + a0
and for n = 2 the quadratic function
f(x) = a2 x2 + a1x + a0
and so on.
We obtained in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.4 Lagrange’s formulae for linear and for
quadratic functions. The basic idea of the formulae can be used to obtain a formula 
for a polynomial of degree n which is such that f(x0) = f0, f(x1) = f1, f(x2) = f2, … , 
f(xn) = fn. Notice we need (n + 1) values to determine a polynomial of degree n. We can
write Lagrange’s formula in the form.
f(x) = L0(x)f0 + L1(x)f1 + L2(x)f2 + … + Ln(x)fn
where L0(x), L1(x), … , Ln(x) are polynomials of degree n such that
Lk(xj) = 0,
xj ≠xk (or j ≠k)
Lk(xk) = 1
This implies that Lk has the form
(It is easy to verify that Lk has degree n and that Lk(xj) = 0, j ≠k and Lk(xk) = 1.)
Example 2.22
Find the cubic function such that f(−3) = 528, f(0) = 1017, f(2) = 1433 and f(5) = 2312.
Solution
Notice that we need four data points to determine a cubic function. We can write
f(x) = L0(x)f0 + L1(x)f1 + L2(x)f2 + L3(x)f3
where x0 = −3, f0 = 528, x1 = 0, f1 = 1017, x2 = 2, f2 = 1433, x3 = 5 and f3 = 2312. Thus

Basic properties
Polynomials have two important mathematical properties.
Property (i)
If two polynomials are equal for all values of the independent variable then corres-
ponding coefﬁcients of the powers of the variable are equal. Thus if
f(x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + … + a1x + a0
g(x) = bnx n + bn−1x n−1 + … + b1x + b0
and
f(x) = g(x)
for all x
then
ai = bi
for i = 0, 1, 2, … , n
This property forms the basis of a technique called equating coefﬁcients, which will
be used in determining partial fractions in Section 2.5.
Property (ii)
Any polynomial with real coefﬁcients can be expressed as a product of linear and 
irreducible quadratic factors.
Example 2.23
Find the values of A, B and C that ensure that
x2 + 1 = A(x −1) + B(x + 2) + C(x2 + 2)
for all values of x.
Solution
Multiplying out the right-hand side, we have
x2 + 0x + 1 = Cx2 + (A + B)x + (−A + 2B + 2C)
Using Property (i), we compare, or equate, the coefﬁcients of x2, x and x0 in turn to give

Factorization
Although Property (ii) was known earlier, the ﬁrst rigorous proof was published by
Gauss in 1799. The result is an ‘existence theorem’. It tells us that polynomials can be
factored but does not indicate how to ﬁnd the factors!
Example 2.24
Factorize the polynomials
(a) x3 −3x2 + 6x −4
(b) x4 −16
(c) x4 + 16
Solution
(a) The function f(x) = x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 clearly has the value zero at x = 1. Thus 
x −1 must be a factor of f(x). We can now divide x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 by x −1 using algebraic
division, a process akin to long division of numbers. The process may be set out as follows.
Step 1
x −1)x3 −3x2 + 6x −4(
In order to produce the term x3, x −1 must be multiplied by x2. Do this and subtract the
result from x3 −3x2 + 6x −4.
x −1)x3 −3x2 + 6x −4(x2
x3 −x2
−2x2 + 6x −4
Step 2
Now repeat the process on the polynomial −2x2 + 6x −4. In this case, in order to elim-
inate the term −2x2, we must multiply x −1 by −2x.
x −1)x3 −3x2 + 6x −4(x2 −2x
x3 −x2
−2x2 + 6x −4
−2x2 + 2x

Step 3
Finally we must multiply x −1 by 4 to eliminate 4x −4 as follows:
x −1)x3 −3x2 + 6x −4(x2 −2x + 4
x3 −x2
−2x2 + 6x −4
−2x2 + 2x
4x −4
4x −4
Thus
f(x) = (x −1)(x2 −2x + 4)
The quadratic factor x2 −2x + 4 is an irreducible factor, as is shown by ‘completing
the square’:
x2 −2x + 4 = (x −1)2 + 3
(b) The functions f1(x) = x4 and f2(x) = x4 −16 have similar graphs, as shown in 
Figures 2.34(a) and (b). It is clear from these graphs that f2(x) has zeros at two values
of x, where x4 = 16; that is, at x2 = 4 (x2 = −4 is not allowed for real x). Thus the zeros of
f2 are at x = 2 and x = −2, and we can write
f2(x) = x4 −16 = (x2 −4)(x2 + 4)
= (x − 2)(x + 2)(x2 + 4)
(c) The functions f1(x) = x4 and f3(x) = x4 + 16 have similar graphs, as shown in 
Figures 2.34(a) and (c). It is clear from these graphs that f3(x) does not have any real
zeros, so we expect it to be factored into two quadratic terms. We can write
x4 + 16 = (x2 + 4)2 −8x2
which is a difference of squares and may be factored.
(x2 + 4)2 −8x2 = (x2 + 4)2 −(x÷8)2 = [(x2 + 4) −x÷8][(x2 + 4) + x÷8]
Figure 2.34 Graphs of (a) y = f1(x) = x4, (b) y = f2(x) = x4 −16 and (c) y = f3(x) = x4 + 16.

102
FUNCTIONS
Thus we obtain
f3(x) = x4 + 16 = (x2 −2x÷2 + 4)(x2 + 2x÷2 + 4)
Since x2 ± 2x÷2 + 4 = (x ± ÷2)2 + 2, we deduce that these are irreducible quadratics.
2.4.3
Nested multiplication and synthetic division
In Example 2.24(a) we found the image value of the polynomial at x = 1 by direct 
substitution. In general, however, the most efﬁcient way to evaluate the image values
of a polynomial function is to use nested multiplication. Consider the cubic function
f(x) = 4x3 −5x2 + 2x + 3
This may be written as
f(x) = [(4x −5)x + 2]x + 3
We evaluate this by evaluating each bracketed expression in turn, working from the
innermost. Thus to ﬁnd f(6), the following steps are taken:
(1)
Multiply 4 by x and subtract 5; in this case 4 × 6 −5 = 19.
(2)
Multiply the result of step 1 by x and add 2; in this case 19 × 6 + 2 = 116.
(3)
Multiply the result of step 2 by x and add 3; in this case 116 × 6 + 3 = 699.
Thus f(6) = 699.
On a computer this is performed by means of a simple recurrence relation. To 
evaluate
f(x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + … + a0
at x = t, we use the formulae
bn−1 = an
bn−2 = tbn−1 + an−1
bn−3 = tbn−2 + an−2
\
b1 = tb2 + a2
b0 = tb1 + a1
f(t) = tb0 + a0
which may be summarized as
(2.13)
(The reason for storing the intermediate values bk will become obvious below.)
Having evaluated f(x) at x = t, it follows that for a given t
f(x) −f(t) = 0

at x = t; that is, f(x) −f(t) has a factor x −t. Thus we can write
f(x) −f(t) = (x −t)(cn−1x n−1 + cn−2x n−2 + … + c1x + c0)
Multiplying out the right-hand side, we have
f(x) −f(t) = cn−1x n + (cn−2 −tcn−1)x n−1 + (cn−3 −tcn−2)x n−2 + … + (c0 −tc1)x + (−tc0)
so that we may write
f(x) = cn−1x n + (cn−2 −tcn−1)x n−1 + (cn−3 −tcn−2)x n−2 + … + (c0 −tc1)x + f(t) −tc0
But
f(x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + an−2x n−2 + … + a1x + a0
So, using Property (i) of Section 2.4.1 and comparing coefﬁcients of like powers of x,
we have
cn−1 = an
cn−2 −tcn−1 = an−1
implying
cn−2 = tcn−1 + an−1
cn−3 −tcn−2 = an−2
implying
cn−3 = tcn−2 + an−2
\
\
\
c0 −tc1 = a1
implying
c0 = tc1 + a1
f(t) −tc0 = a0
implying
f(t) = tc0 + a0
Thus ck satisﬁes exactly the same formula as bk, so that the intermediate numbers gen-
erated by the method are the coefﬁcients of the quotient polynomial. We can then write
f(x) = (bn−1x n−1 + bn−2x n−2 + … + b1x + b0)(x −t) + f(t)
(2.14)
or
Result (2.14) tells us that if the polynomial f(x) given in (2.12) is divided by x −t then
this results in a quotient polynomial q(x) given by
q(x) = bn−1x n−1 + … + b0
and a remainder r = f(t) that is independent of x. Because of this property, the method
of nested multiplication is sometimes called synthetic division.
The coefﬁcients bi, i = 0, … , n −1, of the quotient polynomial and remainder term
f(t) may be determined using the formulae (2.13). The process may be carried out in the
following tabular form:

After the number below the line is calculated as the sum of the two numbers imme-
diately above it, it is multiplied by t and placed in the next space above the line as 
indicated by the arrows. This procedure is repeated until all the terms are calculated.
The method of synthetic division could have been used as an alternative to algebraic
division in Example 2.24.
Example 2.25
Show that f(x) = x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 is zero at x = 1, and hence factorize f(x).
Solution
Using the nested multiplication procedure to divide x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 by x −1 gives the
tabular form
Since the remainder f(1) is zero, it follows that f(x) is zero at x = 1. Thus
f(x) = (x2 −2x + 4)(x −1)
and we have extracted the factor x −1. We may then examine the quadratic factor 
x2 −2x + 4 as we did in Example 2.24(a) and show that it is an irreducible quadratic
factor.
Sometimes in problem-solving we need to rearrange the formula for the polynomial
function as an expansion about a point, x = a, other than x = 0. That is, we need to ﬁnd
the numbers A0, A1, … , An such that
f(x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + … + a1x + a0
= An(x −a)n + An−1(x −a)n−1 + … + A1(x −a) + A0
This transformation can be achieved using the technique illustrated for the quadratic
function in Example 2.19 which depends on the identity property of polynomials. It can
be achieved more easily using repeated synthetic division, as is shown in Example 2.26.
Example 2.26

Roots of polynomial equations
Polynomial equations occur frequently in engineering applications, from the identiﬁca-
tion of resonant frequencies when concerned with rotating machinery to the stability
analysis of circuits. It is often useful to see the connections between the roots of a 
polynomial equation and its coefﬁcients.
Example 2.27
Show that any real roots of the equation
x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 = 0
lie between x = 0 and x = 2.

106
FUNCTIONS
Solution
From Example 2.26 we know that
x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 ≡(x −2)3 + 3(x −2)2 + 6(x −2) + 4
Now if x  2, (x −2)3, (x −2)2 and (x −2) are all positive numbers, so that for x  2
(x −2)3 + 3(x −2)2 + 6(x −2) + 4  0
Thus x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 = 0 does not have a root that is greater than x = 2.
Similarly for x  0, x3 and x are both negative and x3 −3x2 + 6x −4  0 for x  0.
Thus x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 = 0 does not have a root that is less than x = 0. Hence all the real
roots of
x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 = 0
lie between x = 0 and x = 2.
We can generalize the results of Example 2.27. Deﬁning
then the polynomial equation f(x) = 0 has no roots greater than x = a if all of the Ak’s
have the same sign and has no roots less than x = a if the Ak’s alternate in sign.
The roots of a polynomial equation are related to its coefﬁcients in more direct ways.
Consider, for the moment, the quadratic equation with roots α and β. Then we can write
the equation as
(x −α)(x −β) = 0
which is equivalent to
x2 −(α + β)x + αβ = 0
Comparing this to the standard quadratic equation we have
a(x2 −(α + β)x + αβ) ≡ax2 + bx + c
Thus −a(α + β) = b and aαβ = c so that
α + β = −b/a
and
αβ = c/a
This gives us direct links between the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation and its
coefﬁcients and between the product of the roots and the coefﬁcients. Similarly, we can
show that if α, β and γ are the roots of the cubic equation
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0
then
α + β + γ = −b/a, αβ + βγ + γα = c/a, αβγ = −d/a

In general, for the polynomial equation
anx n + an−1x n−1 + an−2x n−2 + … + a1x + a0 = 0
the sum of the products of the roots, k at a time, is (−1)kan−k/an.
Example 2.28
Show that the roots, α, β of the quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0
may be written in the form
Obtain the roots of the equation
1.0x2 + 17.8x + 1.5 = 0
Assuming the numbers given are correctly rounded, calculate error bounds for the roots.
Solution
Using the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation we can select one root, α say,
so that
Then, since αβ = c/a, we have
Now consider the equation
1.0x2 + 17.8x + 1.5 = 0
whose coefﬁcients are correctly rounded numbers. Using the quadratic formula we
obtain the roots
α ≈−17.715 327 56
and
β ≈−0.084 672 44
Using the results of Section 1.5.2 we can estimate error bounds for these answers as
shown in Figure 2.35. From that table we can see that using the form
to estimate α we have an error bound of 0.943, while using

to estimate β we have an error bound of 0.062. As this latter estimate of error is almost
as big as the root itself we might be inclined to regard the answer as valueless. But 
calculating the error bound using the form
gives an estimate of 0.003. Thus we can write
α = −17.7 ± 5% and β = −0.085 ± 4%
The reason for the discrepancy between the two error estimates for β lies in the fact that
in the traditional form of the formula we are subtracting two nearly equal numbers, and
consequently the error bounds dominate.
Example 2.29
The equation 3x3 −x2 −3x + 1 = 0 has a root at x = 1. Obtain the other two roots.
Solution
If α, β and γ are the roots of the equation then
α + β + γ =
αβ + βγ + γα = −
αβγ = −
Setting α = 1 simpliﬁes these to
β + γ =
β + γ + βγ = −1
βγ = −
Hence γ = −1/(3β) and 3β2 + 2β −1 = 0. Factorizing this equation gives
(3β −1)(β + 1) = 0

2.4 POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS

The numerical method most often used for evaluating the roots of a polynomial is the
Newton–Raphson procedure. This will be described in Section 9.5.8.
In MATLAB a polynomial is represented by an array of its coefﬁcients, with the
highest coefﬁcient listed ﬁrst. For example, the polynomial function
f(x) = x3 −5x2 −17x + 21
is represented by
f = [1 –5 -17 21]
The roots of the corresponding polynomial equation f(x) = 0 are obtained using the
command roots(f), so for the above example the command
r = roots(f)
returns the roots as
r = 7.0000
–3.0000
1.0000
which also indicate that the factors of f(x) are (x −7), (x + 3) and (x −1). It is noted
that the output gives the roots r as a column array of numbers (and not a row array).
If the roots are known and we wish to determine the corresponding polynomial f(x),
having unity as the coefﬁcient of its highest power, then use is made of the command
poly(r). To use this command the roots r must be speciﬁed as a row array; so the
commands
r = [7 –3 1]
f = poly(r)
return the answer
f = 1.0000 –5.0000 –17.0000 21.0000
indicating that the polynomial is
f(x) = x3 −5x2 −17x + 21
To determine the polynomial of degree n that passes through n + 1 points we 
use the command polyfit(x,y,n); which outputs the array of coefﬁcients of 
a polynomial of order n that ﬁts the pairs (x, y). If the number of points (x, y) is
greater than n then the command will give the best ﬁt in the least squares sense.
Check that the commands
x = [–3 0 2 5]; y = [528 1017 1433 2312];
f = polyﬁt(x,y,3)
reproduce the answer of Example 2.22 and that the commands
x = [0 1 2 3 4]; y = [1 1 2 2 3];
polyfit(x,y,1)
reproduce the answer to Example 2.17.

110
FUNCTIONS
Graphs of polynomial functions may be plotted using the commands given 
earlier (see p. 71). The result of multiplying two polynomials f(x) and g(x) is
obtained using the command conv(f,g), where f and g are the array speciﬁcation
of f(x) and g(x) respectively. With reference to Example 2.25 conﬁrm that the 
product f(x) = (x2 −2x + 4)(x −1) is obtained using the commands
f1 = [1 –2 4]; f2 = [1 –1];
f = conv(f1, f2)
The division of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) is obtained, by the process of decon-
volution, using the command
[Q,R] = deconv(f,g)
which produces two outputs Q and R, with Q being the coefﬁcients of the quotient
polynomial and R the coefﬁcients of the remainder polynomial. Again with refer-
ence to Example 2.25 check that x3 −3x2 + 6x −4 divided by x −1 gives a quotient
x2 −2x + 4 and a remainder of zero.
Using the Symbolic Math Toolbox operations on polynomials may be undertaken
in symbolic form. Some useful commands, for carrying out algebraic manipulations,
are:
(a) factor command
If f(x) is a polynomial function, expressed in symbolic form, with rational coefﬁ-
cients (see Section 1.2.1) then the commands
syms x
f = factor(f(x))
factorize f(x) as the product of polynomials of lower degree with rational coefﬁcients.
For example, to factorize the cubic f(x) = x3 −5x2 −17x + 21 the commands
syms x
f = factor(x^3 - 5*x^2 – 17*x + 21)
return
f = (x – 1)*(x – 7)*(x + 3)
Using the pretty command
pretty(f)
returns the more readable display
f = (x – 1)(x – 7)(x + 3)
Using the factor command, conﬁrm the factorization of polynomials (a) and (b) in
Example 2.24.
(b) horner command
This command transforms a polynomial f(x) expressed in symbolic form into its
nested (or Horner) representation. For example the commands

2.4 POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
111
syms x
f = horner(4*x^3 – 5*x^2 + 2*x + 3)
return
f = 3 + (2 + (–5 + 4*x)*x)*x
which conﬁrms the nested representation at the outset of Section 2.4.3.
(c) collect command
This collects all the coefﬁcients with the same power of x. For example, if
f(x) = 4x(x2 + 2x + 1) −5(x(x + 2) −x3) + (x + 3)3
then the commands
syms x
f = collect(4*x*(x^2 + 2*x + 1) – 5*(x*(x + 2) – x^3) 
+ (x + 3)^3);
pretty(f)
return
f = 27 + 10x3 + 12x2 + 21x
The collect command may also be used to multiply two polynomials. With 
reference to Example 2.25 the product of the two polynomials x2 −2x + 4 and x −1
is returned by the commands
syms x
f = collect((x – 1)*(x^2 – 2*x + 4));
pretty(f)
as
f = x3 – 3x2 + 6x – 4
(d) simplify command
This is a powerful general purpose command that can be used with a wide range of
functions. For example, if f(x) = (9 −x2)/(3 + x) then the commands
syms x
f = simplify((9 – x^2)/(3 + x))
return
f = -x + 3
(e) simple command
This command seeks to ﬁnd a simpliﬁcation of a symbolic expression so that it 
has the fewest number of characters; that is, it seeks to obtain the shortest form of
the expression. The command sometimes improves on the result returned by the
simplify command. There is no corresponding command in MAPLE.

(f) expand command
This is another general purpose command which can be used with a wide range 
of functions. It distributes products over sums and differences. For example, if 
f(x) = a(x + y) then the commands
syms x a y
f = expand(a*(x + y));
pretty(f)
return
f = ax + ay
(g) solve command
If f(x) is a symbolic expression in the variable x (the expression may also include
parameters) then the command
s = solve (f)
seeks to solve the equation f(x) = 0, returning the solution in a column array. To
solve an equation expressed in the form f(x) = g(x) use is made of the command
s = solve(‘f(x) = g(x)’)
For example, considering the general quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 the 
commands
syms x a b c

Rational functions
Rational functions have the general form
where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials. If the degree of p is less than the degree of q, 
f(x) is said to be a strictly proper rational function. If p and q have the same degree
then f(x) is a proper rational function. It is said to be an improper rational function
if the degree of p is greater than the degree of q.
An improper or proper rational function can always be expressed as a polynomial
plus a strictly proper rational function, for example, by algebraic division.
Example 2.30
Express the improper rational function
as the sum of a polynomial function and a strictly proper rational function.
Solution
We can record the process of division in a manner similar to that of Example 2.22.
Step 1
x2 −2x + 3)3x4 + 2x3 −5x2 + 6x −7(
In order to produce the term 3x4, x2 −2x + 3 must be multiplied by 3x2. Do this and 
subtract the result from 3x4 + 2x3 −5x2 + 6x −7.
x2 −2x + 3)3x4 + 2x3 −5x2 + 6x −7(3x2
3x4 −6x3 + 9x2
8x3 −14x2 + 6x −7
Step 2
Now repeat the process on the polynomial 8x3 −14x2 + 6x −7. In this case, in order to
eliminate the term 8x3 we must multiply x2 −2x + 3 by 8x.

Any strictly proper rational function can be expressed as a sum of simpler functions whose
denominators are linear or irreducible quadratic functions. For example:
These simpler functions are called the partial fractions of the rational function, and are
often useful in the mathematical analysis and design of engineering systems. Notice
that strictly the equality above is an identity since it is true for all values of x in the
domain of the expressions. Here we are following the common practice of writing =
instead of ≡(as we did in Section 1.3.3).
The construction of the partial fraction form of a rational function is the inverse pro-
cess to that of collecting together separate rational expressions into a single rational
function. For example:

FUNCTIONS
But it is clear from this example that reversing the process (working backwards from
the ﬁnal expression) is not easy, and we require a different method in order to ﬁnd the
partial fractions of a given function. To describe the method in its full generality is easy
but difﬁcult to understand, so we will apply the method to a number of commonly
occurring types of function in the next section before stating the general algorithm.
2.5.1
Partial fractions
In this section we will illustrate how proper rational functions of the form p(x)/q(x) may
be expressed in partial fractions.
(a) Distinct linear factors
Each distinct linear factor, of the form (x + α), in the denominator q(x) will give rise to 
a partial fraction of the form 
, where A is a real constant.
Example 2.31
Express in partial fractions the rational function
Solution
In this case we have two distinct linear factors (x −1) and (x + 2) in the denominator,
so the corresponding partial fractions are of the form
where A and B are constants to be determined. Since both expressions are equal and
their denominators are identical we must therefore make their numerators equal, yielding
3x = A(x + 2) + B(x −1)
This identity is true for all values of x, so we can ﬁnd A and B by setting ﬁrst x = 1 and
then x = −2. So
x = 1
gives
3 = A(3) + B(0);
that is
A = 1
and
x = −2
gives
−6 = A(0) + B(−3);
that is
B = 2

Thus
When the denominator q(x) of a strictly proper rational function 
is a product of linear 
factors, as in Example 2.31, there is a quick way of expressing 
in partial fractions.
Considering again Example 2.31, if
then to obtain A simply cover up the factor (x −1) in
and evaluate what is left at x = 1, giving
Likewise, to obtain B cover up the factor (x + 2) in the left-hand side and evaluate what
is left at x = −2, giving
Thus, as before,
This method of obtaining partial fractions is called the cover up rule.

Because it is easy to make an error with this process, it is sensible to check the answers
obtained. This can be done by using a ‘spot’ value to check that the left- and right-hand
sides yield the same value. When doing this avoid using x = 0 or any of the special values
of x that were used in ﬁnding the coefﬁcients.
For example, taking x = 1 in the partial fraction expansion of Example 2.32, we have

(b) Repeated linear factors
Each k times repeated linear factor, of the form (x −α)k, in the denominator q(x) will
give rise to a partial fraction of the form
where A1, A2, … , Ak are real constants.
Example 2.33

In this case the denominator consists of the distinct linear factor (x + 2) and the 
twice repeated linear factor (x −1). Thus, the corresponding partial fractions are of

which gives
3x + 1 = A(x −1)(x + 2) + B(x + 2) + C(x −1)2
Setting x = 1 gives 4 = B(3) and 
. Setting x = −2 gives −5 = C(−3)2 and
.
To obtain A we can give x any other value, so taking x = 0 gives
1 = (−2)A + 2B + C
and substituting the values of B and C gives 
. Hence
(c) Irreducible quadratic factors
Each distinct irreducible quadratic factor, of the form (ax2 + bx + c), in the denomin-
ator q(x) will give rise to a partial fraction of the form
where A and B are real constants.
Example 2.34
Express as partial fractions the rational function
Solution
In this case the denominator consists of the distinct linear factor (x −2) and the distinct
irreducible quadratic factor (x2 + x + 1). Thus, the corresponding partial fractions are of
the form
giving
5x = (Ax + B)(x −2) + C(x2 + x + 1)
Setting x = 2 enables us to calculate C:

Here, however, we cannot select special values of x that give A and B immediately,
because x2 + x + 1 is an irreducible quadratic and cannot be factorized. Instead we make
use of Property (i) of polynomials, described in Section 2.4.1, which stated that if two
polynomials are equal in value for all values of x then the corresponding coefﬁcients
are equal. Applying this to
5x = (Ax + B)(x −2) + C(x2 + x + 1)
we see that the coefﬁcient of x2 on the right-hand side is A + C while that on the left-
hand side is zero. Thus
A + C = 0
and
A =
Similarly the coefﬁcient of x0 on the right-hand side is −2B + C and that on the left-
hand side is zero, and we obtain −2B + C = 0, which implies
. Hence
Example 2.35
Express as partial fractions the rational function
Solution
In this example the numerator has the same degree as the denominator.
The ﬁrst step in such examples is to divide the bottom into the top to obtain a 
polynomial and a strictly proper rational function. Thus
We then apply the partial-fraction process to the remainder, setting
giving
6 −3x = A(x + 2) + B(x −1)
Setting ﬁrst x = 1 and then x = −2 gives A = 1 and B = −4 respectively. Thus

Summary of method
In general, the method for ﬁnding the partial fractions of a given function f(x) = p(x)/q(x) consists of
the following steps.
Step 1: If the degree of p is greater than or equal to the degree of q, divide q into p to obtain
where the degree of s is less than the degree of q.
Step 2: Factorize q(x) fully into real linear and irreducible quadratic factors, collecting together all
like factors.
Step 3: Each linear factor ax + b in q(x) will give rise to a fraction of the type
(Here a and b are known and A is to be found.)
Each repeated linear factor (ax + b)n will give rise to n fractions of the type
Each irreducible quadratic factor ax2 + bx + c in q(x) will give rise to a fraction of the type
Each repeated irreducible quadratic factor (ax2 + bx + c)n will give rise to n fractions of the type
Put p(x)/q(x) (or s(x)/q(x), if that case occurs) equal to the sum of all the fractions involved.
Step 4: Multiply both sides of the equation by q(x) to obtain an identity involving polynomials, from
which the multiplying constants of the linear combination may be found (because of Property (i) in
Section 2.4.1).
Step 5: To ﬁnd these coefﬁcients, two strategies are used.
l
Strategy 1: Choose special values of x that make ﬁnding the values of the unknown coefﬁcients
easy: for example, choose x equal to the roots of q(x) = 0 in turn and use the ‘cover up’ rule.
l
Strategy 2: Compare the coefﬁcients of like powers of x on both sides of the identity. Starting
with the highest and lowest powers usually makes it easier.
Strategy 1 may leave some coefﬁcients undetermined. In that case we complete the process using
Strategy 2.
Step 6: Lastly, check the answer either by choosing a test value for x or by putting the partial
fractions over a common denominator.

FUNCTIONS
There is no command in MATLAB that will symbolically express rational functions
in partial fractions. However use of the maple command in MATLAB enables us 
to access MAPLE commands directly. Thus, adopting the convert command in
MAPLE a rational function f(x) may be expressed in partial fraction ‘pf’ form using,
in MATLAB, the commands
syms x
pf = maple(‘convert’,f(x),‘ parfrac’,x);
pretty(pf)
For example, considering Example 2.32, the commands
syms x
pf = maple(‘convert’,(2*x + 1)/((x – 2)*(x + 1)*(x - 3)),
‘parfrac’,x);
pretty(pf)
return

2.5.3
Asymptotes
Sketching the graphs of rational functions gives rise to the concept of an asymptote. To
illustrate, let us consider the graph of the function
and that of its inverse
Expressing x/(x + 1) as (x + 1 −1)/(x + 1) = 1 −1/(x + 1), we see that as x gets larger
and larger 1/(x + 1) gets smaller and smaller, so that x/(x + 1) approaches closer and
closer to the value 1. This is illustrated in the graph of y = f(x) shown in Figure 2.39(a).
The line y = 1 is called a horizontal asymptote to the curve, and we note that the graph
of f(x) approaches this asymptote as | x | becomes large.

The graph of the inverse function y = f −1(x) is shown in Figure 2.39(b), and the line
x = 1 is called a vertical asymptote to the curve.
The existence of asymptotes is a common feature of the graphs of rational func-
tions. They feature in various engineering applications, such as in the plotting of root
locus plots in control engineering. In more advanced applications of mathematics 
to engineering the concept of an asymptote is widely used for the purposes of 
making approximations. Asymptotes need not necessarily be horizontal or vertical
lines; they may be sloping lines or indeed non-linear graphs, as we shall see in 
Example 2.37.

Example 2.36

and ﬁnd the values of x for which
Solution
We can see from the formula for y that the line x = 3 is a vertical asymptote of the func-
tion. As x gets closer and closer to the value x = 3 from the left-hand side (that is, x  3),
y gets larger and larger and is positive. As x gets closer and closer to x = 3 from the right-
hand side (that is, x  3), y is negative and large. As x gets larger and larger, y gets
smaller and smaller for both x  0 and x  0, so y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote. Thus
we obtain the sketch shown in Figure 2.40. By drawing the line y = 2 on the sketch, we
see at once that
for x 
and x  3. This result was obtained algebraically in Example 1.24. Generally
we use a mixture of algebraic and graphical methods to solve such problems.

Example 2.37
Sketch the graph of the function
(x ≠−1)
Solution
We begin the task by locating points at which the function is zero. Now f(x) = 0 implies
that x2 −x −6 = (x −3)(x + 2) = 0, from which we deduce that x = 3 and x = −2 are
zeros of the function. Thus the graph y = f(x) crosses the x axis at x = −2 and x = 3.
Next we locate the points at which the denominator of the rational function is zero,
which in this case is x = −1. As x approaches such a point, the value of f(x) becomes
inﬁnitely large in magnitude, and the value of the rational function is undeﬁned at such
a point. Thus the graph of y = f(x) has a vertical asymptote at x = −1. (There is usually

a vertical asymptote to the graph of the rational function y = p(x)/q(x) at points where
the denominator q(x) = 0.)
Next we consider the behaviour of the function as x gets larger and larger, that is 
as x →∞or x →−∞. To do this, we ﬁrst simplify the rational function by algebraic
division, giving
As x →±∞, 4/(x + 1) →0. Thus, for large values of x, both positive and negative,
4/(x + 1) becomes negligible compared with x, so that f(x) tends to behave like x −2.
Thus the line y = x −2 is also an asymptote to the graph of y = f(x).
Having located the asymptotes, we then need to ﬁnd how the graph approaches
them. When x is large and positive the term 4/(x + 1) will be small but positive, so that
f(x) is slightly less than x −2. Hence the graph approaches the asymptote from below.
When x is large and negative the term 4/(x + 1) is small but negative, so the graph
approaches the asymptote from above. To consider the behaviour of the function near
x = −1, we examine the factorized form
When x is slightly less than −1, f(x) is positive. When x is slightly greater than −1, f(x)
is negative.
We are now in a position to sketch the graph of y = f(x) as shown in Figure 2.41.

Modern computational aids have made graphing functions much easier, but to obtain
graphs of a reasonably good quality some preliminary analysis is always necessary.
This helps to select the correct range of values for the independent variable and for the
function. For example, asking a computer package to plot the function

without prior analysis might result in the graph shown in Figure 2.42(a). A little analysis
shows that the function is undeﬁned at x = 1 and 2. Excluding these points from the range
of values for x produces the more acceptable plot shown in Figure 2.42(b), although it
is not clear from either plot that the graph has a horizontal asymptote y = 13. Clearly,
much more preliminary work is needed to obtain a good quality graph of the function.
2.5.4
Parametric representation
In some practical situations the equation describing a curve in cartesian coordinates 
is very complicated and it is easier to specify the points in terms of a parameter. Some-
times this occurs in a very natural way. For example, in considering the trajectory of a
projectile, we might specify its height and horizontal displacement separately in terms
of the ﬂight time. In the design of a safety guard for a moving part in a machine we
might specify the position of the part in terms of an angle it has turned through. Such
representation of curves is called parametric representation and we will illustrate 
the idea with an example. Later, in Section 2.6.6, we shall consider the polar form of 
specifying the equation of a curve.
Example 2.38
Sketch the graph of the curve given by x = t3, y = t2 (t  R).
Solution
The simplest approach to this type of curve sketching using pencil and paper is to draw
up a table of values, as in Figure 2.43.

Graph of the 
semi-cubical parabola
x = t3, y = t2 (t  R).
Solution
The velocity time graphs in the horizontal and vertical directions are shown in Figures
2.45(a) and (b). The horizontal displacement after time t is x = ut (velocity × time), and
the vertical displacement is y = (v −
gt)t (average velocity × time). Thus the trajectory
of the projectile is given (parametrically) by
x = ut, y = vt −
gt2
Since x = ut we may write t = x/u. Substituting this into the expression for y gives
which is the equation of a parabola.
Completing the square we obtain
from which we can see that the projectile attains its maximum height,
at x = uv/g.
The range of the projectile is found by setting y = 0 which gives x =
. The path
of the projectile is illustrated in Figure 2.45(c).

Circular functions
The study of circular functions has a long history. The earliest known table of a circu-
lar function dates from 425 BCE and was calculated using complicated geometrical
methods by the Greek astronomer-mathematician Hipparchus. He calculated the lengths
of chords subtended by angles at the centre of a circle from 0° to 60° at intervals of °
(see Figure 2.46(a)). His work was developed by succeeding generations of Greek
1

mathematicians culminating in the publication in the second century CE of a book by
Ptolemy. His book Syntaxis, commonly called ‘The Great Collection’, was translated
ﬁrst into Arabic, where it became Al-majisti and then into Latin, Almagestus.
Another contribution came from the Hindu mathematician Aryabhata (about 500 CE)
who developed a radial measure related to angle measures and the function we now 
call the sine function (see Figure 2.46(b)). His work was ﬁrst translated from Hindi into
Arabic and then from Arabic into Latin. The various terms we use in studying these
functions reﬂect this rich history of applied mathematics (360° from the Babylonians
through the Greeks, degrees from the Latin degradus, minutes from pars minuta, sine
from the Latin sinus, a mistranslation of the Hindu-Arabic jiva).
There are two approaches to the deﬁnition of the circular or trigonometric func-
tions and this is reﬂected in their double name. One approach is static in nature and the
other dynamic.
2.6.1
Trigonometric ratios
The static approach began with practical problems of surveying and gave rise to the
mathematical problems of triangles and their measurement that we call trigonometry.
We consider a right-angled triangle ABC, where ∠CAB is the right-angle, and deﬁne the
sine, cosine and tangent functions in relation to that triangle. Thus in Figure 2.47 we have
The way in which these functions were deﬁned led to their being called the ‘trigono-
metrical ratios’. The context of the applications implied that the angles were measured in
the sexagesimal system (degees, minutes, seconds): for example, 35°21′41″ which today
is written in the decimal form 35.36°. In modern textbooks this is shown explicitly,
writing, for example, sin30°, or cos 35.36°, or tan θ°, so that the independent variable
θ is a pure number. For example, by considering the triangles shown in Figure 2.48(a),
we can readily write down the trigonometric ratios for 30°, 45° and 60°, as indicated in
the table of Figure 2.48(b).

To extend trigonometry to problems involving triangles that are not necessarily
right-angled, we make use of the sine and cosine rules. Using the notation of Figure 2.49
(note that it is usual to label the side opposite an angle by the corresponding lower-case
letter), we have, for any triangle ABC:

2.6.3
Circular functions
The dynamic deﬁnition of the functions arises from considering the motion of a point
P around a circle, as shown in Figure 2.54. Many practical mechanisms involve this
mathematical model.
The distance OP is one unit, and the perpendicular distance NP of P from the initial
position OP0 of the rotating radius is the sine of the angle ∠P0OP. Note that we are 
measuring NP positive when P is above OP0 and negative when P is below OP0.
Similarly, the distance ON deﬁnes the cosine of ∠P0OP as being positive when N is to
the right of O and negative when it is to the left of O.
Because we are concerned with circles and rotations in these deﬁnitions, it is natural
to use circular measure so that ∠P0OP, which we denote by x, is measured in radians.
In this case we write simply sin x or cos x, where, as before, x is a pure number. One
radian is the angle that, in the notation of Figure 2.54, is subtended at the centre when
the arclength P0P is equal to the radius OP0. Obviously therefore
180° = π radians
a result we can use to convert degrees to radians and vice versa. It also follows from
the deﬁnition of a radian that

To obtain the graph of sin x, we simply need to read off the values of PN as the point
P moves around the circle, thus generating the graph of Figure 2.56. Note that as we
continue around the circle for a second revolution (that is, as x goes from 2π to 4π) the
graph produced is a replica of that produced as x goes from 0 to 2π, the same being true
for subsequent intervals of 2π. By allowing P to rotate clockwise around the circle, we
see that sin(−x) = −sin x, so that the graph of sin x can be extended to negative values
of x, as shown in Figure 2.57.
Since the graph replicates itself for every interval of 2π,
sin(x + 2πk) = sin x, k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
(2.19)
and the function sin x is said to be periodic with period 2π.

Graph of y = cos x.
To obtain the graph of y = cos x, we need to read off the value of ON as the point P
moves around the circle. To make the plotting of the graph easier, we ﬁrst rotate the 
circle through 90° anticlockwise and then proceed as for y = sin x to produce the graph of
Figure 2.58. By allowing P to rotate clockwise around the circle, we see that cos(−x) =
cos x, so that the graph can be extended to negative values of x, as shown in Figure 2.59.
Again, the function cos x is periodic with period 2π, so that
cos(x + 2πk) = cos x, k = 0, ±1, ±2, …
(2.20)
Note also that the graph of y = sin x is that of y = cos x moved
π units to the right, 
while that of y = cos x is the graph of y = sin x moved
π units to the left. Thus, from 
Section 2.2.3,
sin x = cos(x − π) 
or
cos x = sin(x +
π)

The deﬁnition of tan x is similar, and makes obvious the origin of the name ‘tangent’
for this function. In Figure 2.60 the rotating radius OP is extended until it cuts the tan-
gent P0M to the circle at the initial position P0. The length P0M is the tangent of ∠P0OP.
Allowing P to move around the circle, we generate the graph shown in Figure 2.60.
Again, by allowing P to move in a clockwise direction, we have tan(−x) = −tan x, and the
graph can readily be extended to negative values of x, as shown in Figure 2.61. In this
case the graph replicates itself every interval of duration π, so that
tan(x + πk) = tan x, k = 0, ±1, ±2, …
(2.22)
and tan x is of period π.
These deﬁnitions of sine, cosine and tangent show how they are associated with the
properties of the circle, and consequently they are called circular functions. Often in
an engineering context, the static and dynamic uses of these functions occur simultan-
eously. Consequently, we often refer to them as trigonometric functions.
Using the results (2.19), (2.20) and (2.22), it is possible to calculate the values of the
trigonometric functions for angles greater than π using their values for angles between 
zero and π. The rule is: take the acute angle that the direction makes with the initial
direction, ﬁnd the sine, cosine or tangent of this angle and multiply by +1 or −1 according
to the scheme of Figure 2.62. For example

cos(135°) = cos(180° −45°) = −cos 45° = −÷
sin(330°) = sin(360° −30°) = −sin 30° = −
tan(240°) = tan(180° + 60°) = tan 60° = ÷3
As we frequently move between measuring angles in degrees and in radians, it is 
important to check that your calculator is in the correct mode.
If the radius OP is rotating with constant angular velocity ω (in rad s−1) about O then
x = ωt, where t is the time (in s). The time T taken for one complete revolution is given
by ωT = 2π; that is, T = 2π/ω. This is the period of the motion. In one second the radius
makes ω/2π such revolutions. This is the frequency, ν. Its value is given by
Thus, the function y = Asin ωt, which is associated with oscillatory motion in engineer-
ing, has period 2π/ω and amplitude A. The term amplitude is used to indicate the 
maximum distance of the graph of y = A sin ωt from the horizontal axis.
Example 2.41
Sketch using the same set of axes the graphs of the functions
(a) y = 2 sin t
(b) y = sin t
(c) y =
sin t
and discuss.
Solution
The graphs of the three functions are shown in Figure 2.63. The functions (a), (b) and
(c) have amplitudes 2, 1 and 
respectively. We note that the effect of changing the
amplitude is to alter the size of the ‘humps’ in the sine wave. Note that changing only
the amplitude does not alter the points at which the graph crosses the x axis. All three
functions have period 2π.

Solution
The graphs of the three functions (a), (b) and (c) are shown in Figure 2.64. All three
have amplitude 1 and periods 2π, π and 4π respectively. We note that the effect of
changing the parameter ω in sin ωt is to ‘squash’ or ‘stretch’ the basic sine wave sin t.
All that happens is that the basic pattern repeats itself less or more frequently; that is,
the period changes.

In engineering we frequently encounter the sinusoidal function
y = A sin(ωt + α),
ω  0
(2.23)
Following the discussion in Section 2.2.4, we have that the graph of this function is
obtained by moving the graph of y = A sinωt horizontally:
units to the left if α is positive
or
units to the right if α is negative
The sine wave of (2.23) is said to ‘lead’ the sine wave A sinωt when α is positive
and to ‘lag’ it when α is negative.
Example 2.43
Sketch the graph of y = 3 sin(2t +
π).
Solution
First we sketch the graph of y = 3 sin 2t, which has amplitude 3 and period π, as 
shown in Figure 2.65(a). In this case α =
π and ω = 2, so it follows that the graph 
of y = 3 sin(2t +
π) is obtained by moving the graph of y = 3 sin 2t horizontally to 
the left by π units. This is shown in Figure 2.65(b).

Example 2.44
Consider the crank and connecting rod mechanism illustrated in Figure 2.66. Determine
a functional relationship between the displacement of Q and the angle through which
the crank OP has turned.
Solution
As the crank OP rotates about O, the other end of the connecting rod moves backwards
and forwards along the slide AB. The displacement of Q from its initial position
depends on the angle through which the crank OP has turned. A mathematical model
for the mechanism replaces the crank and connecting rod, which have thickness as well
as length, by straight lines, which have length only, and we consider the motion of the
point Q as the line OP rotates about O, with PQ ﬁxed in length and Q constrained to
move on the line AB, as shown in Figure 2.67. We can specify the dependence of Q on
the angle of rotation of OP by using some elementary trigonometry. Labelling the
length of OP as r units, the length of PQ as l units, the length of OQ as y units and the
angle ∠AOP as x radians, and applying the cosine formula gives
Figure 2.66
Crank and connecting
rod mechanism.

l2 = r2 + y2 −2yr cos x
which implies
(y −r cos x)2 = l2 −r2 + r2 cos2x
= l2 −r2 sin2x
and
y = r cos x + ÷(l 2 −r2 sin2x)
Thus for any angle x we can calculate the corresponding value of y. We can represent
this relationship by means of a graph, as shown in Figure 2.68.

FUNCTIONS
In MATLAB the circular functions are represented by sin(x), cos(x) and
tan(x) respectively. (Note that MATLAB uses radians in function evaluation.)
Also in MATLAB pi (Pi in MAPLE) is a predeﬁned variable representing the
quantity π. As an example check that the commands
t = –2*pi : pi/90 : 2*pi;
y1 = sin(t); y2 = sin(2*t); y3 = sin(0.5*t);
plot(t, y1, ‘-’,t ,y2, ‘- -’, t, y3, ‘-.’)
output the basic plots of Figure 2.64.
In symbolic form graphs may be produced using the ezplot command. Check
that the commands
syms t
y = sym(3*sin(2*t + pi/3));
ezplot(y,[–2*pi,2*pi] )
grid
produce the plot of Figure 2.65(b).
2.6.4
Trigonometric identities
Other circular functions are deﬁned in terms of the three basic functions sine, cosine
and tangent. In particular, we have
the secant function
the cosecant function
the cotangent function
In MATLAB these are determined by sec(x), csc(x) and cot(x) respectively.
From the basic deﬁnitions it is possible to deduce the following trigonometric identities
relating the functions.
Triangle identities
cos2x + sin2x = 1
(2.24a)
1 + tan2x = sec2x
(2.24b)
1 + cot2x = cosec2x
(2.24c)
The ﬁrst of these follows immediately from the use of Pythagoras’ theorem in a
right-angled triangle with a unit hypotenuse. Dividing (2.24a) through by cos2x yields
identity (2.24b), and dividing through by sin2x yields identity (2.24c).

cos 2x = cos2x −sin2x

Express cos(π/2 + 2x) in terms of sin x and cos x.
Solution
Using identity (2.25c) we obtain
cos(π/2 + 2x) = cosπ/2 cos 2x −sin π/2 sin 2x
Since cosπ/2 = 0 and sin π/2 = 1, we can simplify to obtain
cos(π/2 + 2x) = −sin 2x
Now using the double-angle formula (2.27a), we obtain
cos(π/2 + 2x) = −2sin x cos x

Show that
sin(A + B) + sin(A −B) = 2 sin A cos B
and deduce that
sin x + sin y = 2 sin
(x + y) cos
(x −y)
Hence sketch the graph of y = sin 4x + sin 2x.
Solution
Using identities (2.25a) and (2.25b) we have
sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B
sin(A −B) = sin A cos B −cos A sin B
Adding these two identities gives
sin(A + B) + sin(A −B) = 2 sin A cos B
Now setting A + B = x and A −B = y, we see that A =
(x + y) and B =
(x −y) so that
sin x + sin y = 2 sin
(x + y) cos
(x −y)
which is identity (2.26a). (The identities (2.26b–d) can be proved in the same manner.)
Applying the formula to
y = sin 4x + sin 2x
we obtain
y = 2 sin 3x cos x
The graphs of y = sin 3x and y = cos x are shown in Figures 2.69(a) and (b). The 
combination of these two graphs yields Figure 2.69(c). This type of combination of
oscillations in practical situations leads to the phenomena of ‘beats’.

The identities 2.26(a–d) are useful for turning the sum or difference of sines and cosines
into a product of sines and/or cosines in many problems. But the reverse process is 
also useful in others! So we summarize here the expressing of products as sums or 
differences.

mathematical tables used only tabulated the functions up to 45°to save space so that all
four identities were used.
Example 2.47
Solve the equation 2 cos2x + 3 sin x = 3 for 0  x  2π.
Solution
First we express the equation in terms of sin x only. This can be done by eliminating
cos2x using the identity (2.24a), giving
2(1 −sin2x) + 3 sin x = 3
which reduces to
2 sin2x −3 sin x + 1 = 0
This is now a quadratic equation in sin x, and it is convenient to write λ = sin x, giving
2λ2 −3λ + 1 = 0
Factorizing then gives
(2λ −1)(λ −1) = 0
leading to the two solutions
λ =
and
λ = 1
We now return to the fact that λ = sin x to determine the corresponding values of x.
(i) If λ =
then sin x =
. Remembering that sin x is positive for x lying in the ﬁrst 
and second quadrants and that sin
, we have two solutions corresponding to 
λ =

π and x =

(ii) If λ = 1 then sin x = 1, giving the single solution λ =
π.
Thus there are three solutions to the given equation, namely
x =

For ﬁxed V a family of trajectories, for various angles of projection α, is obtained, as

beyond the reach of the projectile.
Solution
Given the coordinates (X, Y), the possible angles α of launch are given by the roots of
the equation
Using the trigonometric identity
gives
Writing T = tanα, this may be rewritten as
(gX 2)T 2 −(2XV 2)T + (gX 2 + 2V 2Y) = 0
which is a quadratic equation in T. From (1.8), this equation will have two different real
roots if
(2XV 2)2  4(gX 2)(gX 2 + 2V 2Y)
but no real roots if
(2XV 2)2  4(gX 2)(gX 2 + 2V 2Y)
Thus the point P(X, Y) is ‘safe’ if
V 4  g2X 2 + 2gV 2Y
The critical case where the point (X, Y) lies on the curve
V 4 = g2x2 + 2gV 2y
gives us the so-called ‘parabola of safety’, with the safety region being that above this

usually have the same frequency as that force. Usually, also, the response will lag behind
the exciting force. Mathematically this is often represented by an external force of the
form F sin ωt with a response of the form a sin ωt + b cos ωt, where a and b are con-
stants dependent on F, ω and the physical characteristics of the system. To ﬁnd the size
of the response we need to write it in the form A sin(ωt + α), where
A sin(ωt + α) = a sinωt + b cosωt
This we can always do, as is illustrated in Example 2.49.
Example 2.49
Express y = 4 sin 3t −3 cos 3t in the form y = A sin(3t + α).
Solution
To determine the appropriate values of A and α, we proceed as follows. 
Using the identity (2.25a), we have
A sin(3t + α) = A(sin 3t cosα + cos 3t sinα)
= (A cosα)sin 3t + (A sinα) cos 3t
Since this must equal the expression
4 sin 3t −3cos 3t
for all values of t, the respective coefﬁcients of sin 3t and cos3t must be the same in
both expressions, so that
4 = A cosα
(2.29)
and
−3 = A sinα
(2.30)
The angle α is shown in Figure 2.71. By Pythagoras’ theorem,
A = ÷(16 + 9) = 5
and clearly
tanα =
The value of α may now be determined using a calculator. However, care must be taken
to ensure that the correct quadrant is chosen for α. Since A is taken to be positive, it 
follows from Figure 2.71 that α lies in the fourth quadrant. Thus, using a calculator, we
have α = −0.64 rad and
y = 4 sin 3t −3 cos 3t = 5 sin(3t −0.64)

Inverse circular (trigonometric) functions
Considering the inverse of the trigonometric functions, it follows from the deﬁnition
given in (2.4) that the inverse sine function sin−1x (also sometimes denoted by arcsin x)
is such that
if
y = sin−1x
then
x = sin y
Here x should not be interpreted as an angle – rather sin−1x represents the angle whose
sine is x. Applying the procedures for obtaining the graph of the inverse function given
in Section 2.2.3 to the graph of y = sin x (Figure 2.55) leads to the graph shown in
Figure 2.73(a). As we explained in Example 2.8, when considering the inverse of y = x2,
the graph of Figure 2.73(a) is not representative of a function, since for each value of x
in the domain −1  x  1 there are an inﬁnite number of image values (as indicated by
the points of intersection of the broken vertical line with the graph). To overcome this
problem, we restrict the range of the inverse function sin−1x to −π  sin−1x 
π and
deﬁne the inverse sine function by
if y = sin−1x then x = sin y,
where −π  y 
π and −1  x  1
(2.31)
The corresponding graph is shown in Figure 2.73(b).
Similarly, in order to deﬁne the inverse cosine and inverse tangent functions cos−1x
and tan−1x (also sometimes denoted by arccos x and arctan x), we have to restrict the
ranges. This is done according to the following deﬁnitions.
if y = cos−1x then x = cos y,
where 0  y  π and −1  x  1
(2.32)
if y = tan−1x then x = tan y,
where −π  y 
π and x is any 
real number

The corresponding graphs of y = cos−1x and y = tan−1x are shown in Figures 2.74 and
2.75, respectively.
In some books (2.31)–(2.33) are called the principal values of the inverse functions.
A calculator will automatically give these values.
Example 2.50
Evaluate sin−1x, cos−1x, tan−1x where (a) x = 0.35 and (b) x = −0.7, expressing the
answers correct to 4dp.
Solution
(a) sin−1(0.35) is the angle α which lies between −π/2 and +π/2 and is such that 
sin α = 0.35. Using a calculator we have
sin−1(0.35) = 0.3576 (4dp) = 0.1138π
which clearly lies between −π/2 and +π/2.
cos−1(0.35) is the angle β which lies between 0 and π and is such that cos β = 0.35.
Using a calculator we obtain
cos−1(0.35) = 1.2132 (4dp) = 0.3862π
which lies between 0 and π.
tan−1(0.35) is the angle γ which lies between −π/2 and +π/2 and is such that 
tanγ = 0.35. Using a calculator we have
tan−1(0.35) = 0.3367 (4dp) = 0.1072π
which lies in the correct range of values.
Notice
(b) sin−1(−0.7) is the angle α which lies between −π/2 and +π/2 and is such that
sin α = −0.7. Again using a calculator we obtain
sin−1(−0.7) = −0.7754 (4dp)
which lies in the correct range of values.
cos−1(−0.7) is the angle β which lies between 0 and π and is such that cosβ = −0.7.

Thus β = 2.3462, which lies in the second quadrant as expected.
tan−1(−0.7) is the angle γ which lies between −π/2 and +π/2 and is such that tan
γ = −0.7. Thus γ = −0.6107, lying in the fourth quadrant, as expected.
Example 2.51
Sketch the graph of the function y = sin−1(sin x).
Solution
Before beginning to sketch the graph we need to examine the algebraic properties of 
the function. Because of the way sin−1 is deﬁned we know that for −π/2  x  π/2, 
sin−1(sin x) = x. (The function sin−1x strictly is the inverse function of sin x with the
restricted domain −π/2  x  π/2.) We also know that sin x is an odd function, so that
sin(−x) = −sin x. This implies that sin−1x is an odd function. In fact, this is obvious from
its graph (Figure 2.73(b)). Thus, sin−1(sin x) is an odd function. Lastly, since sin x is a
periodic function with period 2π we conclude that sin−1(sin x) is also a periodic func-
tion of period 2π. Thus, if we can sketch the graph between 0 and π, we can obtain 
the graph between −π and 0 by antisymmetry about x = 0 and the whole graph by 
periodicity elsewhere. Using Figures 2.73(a) and 2.73(b) we can obtain the graph of 
the function for 0  x  π, as shown in Figure 2.76 (blue). The graph between −π
and 0 is obtained by antisymmetry about the origin, as shown with the broken line in
Figure 2.76, and the whole graph is obtained making use of the piece between −π and
+π and periodicity.

Polar coordinates
In some applications the position of a point P in a plane is represented by its distance r
from a ﬁxed point O and the angle θ that the line joining P to O makes with some ﬁxed
direction. The pair (r, θ) determine the point uniquely and are called the polar coordin-
ates of P. If polar coordinates are chosen, sharing the same origin O as rectangular 
cartesian coordinates and with the angle θ measured from the direction of the Ox axis
then, as can be seen from Figure 2.77, the polar coordinates (r, θ) and the cartesian
coordinates (x, y) of a point are related by
x = r cosθ,
y = r sinθ
(2.34)
and also
Figure 2.77

2.6 CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS
149
r = ÷(x2 + y2),
Note that the origin does not have a well-deﬁned θ. Some care must be taken when evalu-
ating θ using the above formula to ensure that it is located in the correct quadrant. The
angle tan−1(y/x) obtained from tables or a calculator will usually lie between ± π and
will give the correct value of θ if P lies in the ﬁrst or fourth quadrant. If P lies in the
second or third quadrant then θ = tan−1(y/x) + π. It is sensible to use the values of sin θ
and cos θ to check that θ lies in the correct quadrant.
Note that the angle θ is positive when measured in an anticlockwise direction and
negative when measured in a clockwise direction. Many calculators have rectangular
(cartesian) to polar conversion and vice versa.
Example 2.52
(a) Find the polar coordinates of the points whose cartesian coordinates are (1, 2), 
(−1, 3), (−1, −1), (1, −2), (1, 0), (0, 2), (0, −2).
(b) Find the cartesian coordinates of the points whose polar coordinates are (3, π/4),
(2, −π/6), (2, −π/2), (5, 3π/4).
Solution
(a) Using the formula (2.34) we see that:
(x = 1, y = 2) ≡(r = ÷5, θ = tan−1(2/1) = 1.107)
(x = −1, y = 3) ≡(r = ÷10, θ = 1.893)
(x = −1, y = −1) ≡(r = ÷2, θ = 5π/4)
(x = 1, y = −2) ≡(r = ÷5, θ = −1.107)
(x = 1, y = 0) ≡(r = 1, θ = 0)
(x = 0, y = 2) ≡(r = 2, θ = π/2)
(x = 0, y = −2) ≡(r = 2, θ = −π/2)
(Here answers, where appropriate, are given to 3dp.)
(b) Using the formula (2.34) we see that
(r = 3, θ = π/4) ≡(x = 3/÷2, y = 3/÷2)
(r = 2, θ = −π/6) ≡(x = ÷3, y = −1)
(r = 2, θ = −π/2) ≡(x = 0, y = −2)
(r = 5, θ = 3π/4) ≡(x = −5/÷2, y = 5÷2)
To plot a curve speciﬁed using polar coordinates we ﬁrst look for any features, for
example, symmetry, which would reduce the amount of calculation, and then we draw
up a table of values of r against values of θ. This is a tedious process and we usually
use a graphics calculator or a computer package to perform the task. There are, how-
ever, different conventions in use about polar plotting. Some packages are designed to
1

plot only points where r is positive, so that plotting r = 2a cos θ for 0  θ  π would
yield Figure 2.78(a) while other packages plot negative values of r, treating r as a 
number line, so that r = 2a cosθ for 0  θ  π yields Figure 2.78(b).
Example 2.53
Express the equation of the circle
(x −a)2 + y2 = a2
in polar form.
Solution
Expanding the squared term, the equation of the given circle becomes
x 2 + y2 −2ax = 0
Using the relationships (2.34), we have
r 2(cos2θ + sin2θ) −2ar cosθ = 0
Using the trigonometric identity (2.24a),
r(r − 2a cosθ) = 0,
−π/2  θ  π/2
Since r = 0 gives the point (0, 0), we can ignore this, and the equation of the circle
becomes
r = 2a cos θ,
−π/2  θ  π/2
Example 2.54
Sketch the curve whose polar equation is r = 1 + cos θ.
Solution
The simplest approach when sketching a curve given in polar coordinate form is to
draw up a table of values as in Figure 2.79.

Because it is difﬁcult to measure angles accurately it is easier to convert these values
into the cartesian coordinate values using (2.34) when polar coordinate graph paper is
not available. The sketch of the curve, a cardioid, is shown in Figure 2.80. Here we
have made use of the symmetry of the curve about the line θ = 0, that is, the line y = 0.

Exponential, logarithmic and hyperbolic functions
The members of this family of functions are closely interconnected. They occur in
widely varied applications, from heat transfer analysis to bridge design, from trans-
mission line modelling to the production of chemicals. Historically the exponential and
logarithmic functions arose in very different contexts, the former in the calculation of
compound interest and the latter in computational mathematics, but, as often happens
in mathematics, the discoveries in specialized areas of applicable mathematics have
found applications widely elsewhere.
2.7.1
Exponential functions
Functions of the type f(x) = a x where a is a positive constant (and x is the independent
variable as usual) are called exponential functions.
The graphs of the exponential functions, shown in Figure 2.81, are similar. By a 
simple scaling of the x axis, we can obtain the same graphs for y = 2x, y = 3x and y = 4x,
as shown in Figure 2.82. The reason for this is that we can write 3x = 2kx where k ≈1.585
and 4x = 22x. Thus all exponential functions can be expressed in terms of one exponen-
tial function. The standard exponential function that is used is y = e x, where e is a 
special number approximately equal to

2.7 EXPONENTIAL, LOGARITHMIC AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
153
This number e is chosen because the graph of y = e x (Figure 2.83) has the property that
the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve is equal to the value of the function
at that point. We shall discuss this property again in Section 8.3.12.
We note that the following properties are satisﬁed by the exponential function:
ex1ex2 = ex1+x2
(2.35a)
ex +c = exec = Aex,
where A = ec
(2.35b)
(2.35c)
ekx = (ek)x = a x,
where a = ek
(2.35d)
Often ex is written as exp x for clarity when ‘x’ is a complicated expression. For example,
Example 2.55
A tank is initially ﬁlled with 1000 litres of brine containing 0.25 kg of salt/litre. 
Fresh brine containing 0.5 kg of salt/litre ﬂows in at a rate of 3 litres per second and a
uniform mixture ﬂows out at the same rate. The quantity Q(t) kg of salt in the tank 
t seconds later is given by
Q(t) = A + Be−3t/1000
Find the values of A and B and sketch a graph of Q(t). Use the graph to estimate the
time taken for Q(t) to achieve the value 375.
Solution
Initially there is 1000 × 0.25 kg of salt in the tank, so Q(0) = 250. Ultimately the brine
in the tank will contain 0.5 kg of salt/litre, so the terminal value of Q will be 500. The
terminal value of A + Be−3t/1000 is A, so we deduce A = 500. From initial data we have
250 = 500 + Be0
and since e0 = 1, B = −250 and
Q(t) = 500 −250e−3t/1000

The graph of Q(t) is shown in Figure 2.84. From the graph, an estimate for the time
taken for Q(t) to achieve the value 375 is 234 seconds. From the formula this gives
Q(234) = 376.1. Investigating values near t = 234 using a calculator gives the more
accurate time of 231 seconds.
Example 2.56
The temperature T of a body cooling in an environment, whose unknown ambient 
temperature is α, is given by
T(t) = α + (T0 −α)e−kt
where T0 is the initial temperature of the body and k is a physical constant. To deter-
mine the value of α, the temperature of the body is recorded at two times, t1 and t2,
where t2 = 2t1 and T(t1) = T1, T(t2) = T2. Show that
Solution
From the formula for T(t) we have
T1 −α = (T0 −α)e−kt1
and
T2 −α = (T0 −α)e−2kt1
Squaring the ﬁrst of these two equations and then dividing by the second gives
This simpliﬁes to
(T1 −α)2 = (T2 −α)(T0 −α)
Multiplying out both sides, we obtain
−2αT1 + α 2 = T0T2 −(T0 + T2)α + α 2

2.7.2
Logarithmic functions
From the graph of y = ex, given in Figure 2.83, it is clear that it is a one-to-one func-
tion, so that its inverse function is deﬁned. This inverse is called the natural logarithm
function and is written as
y = ln x
(In some textbooks it is written as logex, while in many pure mathematics books it is
written simply as log x.) Using the procedures given in Section 2.2.3, its graph can be
drawn as in Figure 2.85. From the deﬁnition we have
if y = ex
then
x = ln y
(2.36)
which implies that
ln ex = x,
eln y = y
In the same way as there are many exponential functions (2x, 3x, 4x, …), there are
also many logarithmic functions. In general,
y = a x
gives
x = logay
(2.37)
which can be expressed verbally as ‘x equals log to base a of y’. (Note that log10x is
often written, except in advanced mathematics books, simply as log x.) Recalling that
a x = ekx for some constant k, we see now that a x = (ek)x, so that a = ek and k = ln a.
From the deﬁnition of logax it follows that

Despite the fact that these functions occur widely in engineering analysis, they ﬁrst
occurred in computational mathematics. Property (2.38a) transforms the problem of
multiplying two numbers to that of adding their logarithms. The widespread use of 
scientiﬁc calculators has now made the computational application of logarithms largely
irrelevant. They are, however, still used in the analysis of experimental data.
In MATLAB the exponential and logarithmic functions are represented by
exponential:
exp(x)
natural logarithm ln: log(x)
logarithm to base 10: log10(x)
(MAPLE uses ln(x) and log10(x) for the last two, respectively, and uses log(x)
for work with a general base.)

Hyperbolic functions
In applications, certain combinations of exponential functions recur many times and
these combinations are given special names. For example, the mathematical model for
the steady state heat transfer in a straight bar leads to an expression for the temperature
T(x) at a point distance x from one end, given by

158
FUNCTIONS
where l is the total length of the bar, T0 and T1 are the temperatures at the ends and m
is a physical constant. To simplify such expressions a family of functions, called the
hyperbolic functions, is deﬁned as follows:
cosh x =
(ex + e−x),
the hyperbolic cosine
sinh x =
(ex −e−x),
the hyperbolic sine
the hyperbolic tangent
The abbreviation cosh comes from the original Latin name cosinus hyperbolicus; simi-
larly sinh and tanh.
Thus, the expression for T(x) becomes
The reason for the names of these functions is geometric. They bear the same relation-
ship to the hyperbola as the circular functions do to the circle, as shown in Figure 2.86.
Following the pattern of the circular or trigonometric functions, other hyperbolic
functions are deﬁned as follows:
the hyperbolic secant
the hyperbolic cosecant
the hyperbolic cotangent
The graphs of sinh x, cosh x and tanh x are shown in Figure 2.87, where the black broken
lines indicate asymptotes.

x = cosh t, y = sinh t.

2.7 EXPONENTIAL, LOGARITHMIC AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
159
The hyperbolic functions satisfy identities analogous to those satisﬁed by the circular
functions. From their deﬁnitions we have
(2.39)
from which we deduce
cosh x + sinh x = e x
cosh x −sinh x = e−x
and
(cosh x + sinh x)(cosh x −sinh x) = e xe−x
that is,
cosh2x −sinh2x = 1
(2.40)
Similarly, we can show that
sinh(x ± y) = sinh x cosh y ± cosh x sinh y
(2.41a)
cosh(x ± y) = cosh x cosh y ± sinh x sinh y
(2.41b)
(2.41c)
To prove the ﬁrst two of these results, it is easier to begin with the expressions on the
right-hand sides and replace each hyperbolic function by its exponential form. The third
result follows immediately from the previous two by dividing them. Thus
sinh x cosh y =
(e x −e−x)(e y + e−y)
= (e x+y + e x−y −e−x+y −e−x−y)
and interchanging x and y we have
cosh x sinh y =
(e x+y + e y−x −e−y+x −e−x−y)

hyperbolic functions.

Adding these two expressions we obtain
sinh x cosh y + cosh x sinh y =
(e x+y −e−x−y) 
= sinh(x + y)
Example 2.58
A function is given by f(x) = A cosh 2x + B sinh 2x, where A and B are constants and
f(0) = 5 and f(1) = 0. Find A and B and express f(x) as simply as possible.
Solution
Given f(x) = A cosh 2x + B sinh 2x with the conditions f(0) = 5, f(1) = 0, we see that 
A(1) + B(0) = 5
and
A cosh 2 + B sinh 2 = 0
Hence we have A = 5 and B = −5 cosh 2/sinh 2. Substituting into the formula for f(x)
we obtain
Example 2.59
Solve the equation
5 cosh x + 3 sinh x = 4
Solution
The ﬁrst step in solving problems of this type is to express the hyperbolic functions in
terms of exponential functions. Thus we obtain
(e x + e−x) +
(e x −e−x) = 4
On rearranging, this gives
4e x −4 + e−x = 0
or
4e2x −4e x + 1 = 0
which may be written as
(2e x −1)2 = 0
from which we deduce
e x =

Osborn’s rule
In general, to obtain the formula for hyperbolic functions from the analogous identity for
the circular functions, we replace each circular function by the corresponding hyperbolic
function and change the sign of every product or implied product of two sines. This
result is called Osborn’s rule. Its justiﬁcation will be discussed in Section 3.2.9.
Example 2.60
Verify the identity
using the deﬁnition of tanh x. Conﬁrm that it obeys Osborn’s rule.
Solution
From the deﬁnition
and
Thus
= tanh 2x as required
The formula for tan2θ from (2.27e) is
We see that this has an implied product of two sines (tan2θ), so that in terms of hyper-
bolic functions we have, using Osborn’s rule,
which conﬁrms the proof above.

(These are also sometimes denoted as arsinh x, arcosh x and artanh x – not arcsinh x,
etc.) Note the restriction on the range of the inverse hyperbolic cosine to meet the 
condition that exactly one value of y be obtained. These functions, not surprisingly, can
be expressed in terms of logarithms.
For example,
y = sinh−1x
implies
x = sinh y =
(e y −e−y)
Thus
(e y)2 −2x(e y) −1 = 0
and
e y = x ± ÷(x2 + 1)
Since e y  0, we can discount the negative root, and we have, on taking logarithms,
y = sinh−1x = ln[x + ÷(x2 + 1)]

is an algebraic irrational function. Here y is a root of the algebraic equation
xy2 −2(2 + x)y + x = 0
which has polynomial coefﬁcients in x.
On the other hand, y = |x | , although it satisﬁes y2 = x2, is not a root of that equation
(whose roots are y = x and y = −x). The modulus function | x | is an example of a non-
algebraic irrational function.
2.8.1
Algebraic functions
In general we have an algebraic function y = f(x) deﬁned when y is the root of a 
polynomial equation of the form
an(x)yn + an−1(x)yn−1 + … + a1(x)y + a0(x) = 0
Note that here all the coefﬁcients a0 … an may be polynomial functions of the 
independent variable x. For example, consider
y2 −2xy −8x = 0
This deﬁnes, for x  0, two algebraic functions with formulae
y = x + ÷(x2 + 8x)
and
y = x −÷(x2 + 8x)
One of these corresponds to y2 −2xy −8x = 0 with y  0 and the other to y2 −2xy −8x = 0
with y  0. So, when we specify a function implicitly by means of an equation we 
often need some extra information to deﬁne it uniquely. Often, too, we cannot obtain
an explicit algebraic formula for y in terms of x and we have to evaluate the function at
each point of its domain by solving the polynomial equation for y numerically.
Care has to be exercised when using algebraic functions in a larger computation 
in case special values of parameters produce sudden changes in value, as illustrated in
Example 2.62.
Example 2.62
Sketch the graphs of the function
y = ÷(a + bx2 + cx3)/(d −x)
for the domain −3  x  3, where
(a) a = 18, b = 1, c = −1 and d = 6
(b) a = 0, b = 1, c = −1 and d = 0
Solution
(a) y = ÷(18 + x2 −x3)/(6 −x)
We can see that the term inside the square root is positive only when 18 + x2 −x3  0.
Since we can factorize this as (18 + x2 −x3) = (3 −x)(x2 + 2x + 6), we deduce that y is
not deﬁned for x  3. Also, for large negative values of x it behaves like ÷(−x). A sketch
of the graph is shown in Figure 2.89.
(b) y = −÷(x2 −x3)/x
Here we can see that the function is deﬁned for x  1, x ≠0. Near x = 0, since we
can write x = ÷x2 for x  0 and x = −÷x2 for x  0, we see that
y = −÷(1 −x)
for x  0

166
FUNCTIONS
and
y = ÷(1 −x)
for x  0
At x = 0 the function is not deﬁned. The graph of the function is shown in Figure 2.90.
2.8.2
Implicit functions
We have seen in Section 2.8.1 that some algebraic functions are deﬁned implicitly
because we cannot obtain an algebraic formula for them. This applies to a wider 
class of functions where we have an equation relating the dependent and independent 
variables, but where ﬁnding the value of y corresponding to a given value of x requires
a numerical solution of the equation. Generally we have an equation connecting x and
y, such as
f(x, y) = 0
Sometimes we are able to draw a curve which represents the relationship (using 
algebraic methods), but more commonly we have to calculate for each value of x the
corresponding value of y. Most computer graphics packages have an implicit function
option which will perform the task efﬁciently.

Example 2.63
The velocity v and the displacement x of a mass attached to a non-linear spring satisfy
the equation
v2 = −4x2 + x4 + A
where A depends on the initial velocity v0 and displacement x0 of the mass. Sketch the
graph of v against x where
(a) x0 = 1, v0 = 0
(b) x0 = 3, v0 = 0
and interpret your graph.
Solution
(a) With x0 = 1, v0 = 0 we have A = 3 and
v2 = x4 −4x2 + 3 = (x2 −3)(x2 −1)
To sketch the graph by hand it is easiest ﬁrst to sketch the graph of v2 against x, as shown
in Figure 2.91(a). Taking the ‘square root’ of the graph is only possible for v2  0, but
we also know we want that part of the graph which has the initial point (x0, v0) on it. 
So we obtain the closed loop shown in Figure 2.91(b). The arrows on the closed curve
indicate the variation of v with x as time increases. Where the velocity v is positive, the
displacement x increases. Where the velocity is negative, the displacement decreases.
The closed curve indicates that this motion repeats after completing one circuit of the
curve, that is, there is a periodic motion.
Figure 2.91 Graphs for Example 2.63(a).
(b) With x0 = 3, v0 = 0 we have A = −45 and
v2 = x4 −4x2 −45 = (x2 −9)(x2 + 5)
Using the same technique as in part (a), we see that when the mass is released from 
rest at x = 3, its displacement increases without a bound and the motion is not periodic.
The corresponding graphs are shown in Figures 2.92(a) and (b).

Example 2.64
The concentrations of two substances in a chemical process are related by the equation
xye2−y = 2e x−1,
0  x  3, 0  y  3
Investigate this relationship graphically and discover whether it deﬁnes a function.
Solution
Separating the variables in the equation, we have
ye−y = 2e−3e x/x
Substituting u = e x/x and v = ye−y reduces this equation to
v = 2e−3u
so on the u–v plane the relationship is represented by a straight line. Putting the ﬁrst
quadrants of the four planes x–y, v–y, u–x, u–v together we obtain the diagram shown
in Figure 2.93. From that diagram it is clear that the smallest value of u that occurs is

at P and the largest value of v that occurs is at Q, so all the solutions of the equation lie
between P and Q. Any point R which lies between P and Q on the line corresponds to
two values of y and two values of x. So each point R corresponds to four points of the
x−y plane. By considering all the points between P and Q we obtain the closed curve
shown in Figure 2.94. We can see from that diagram that the equation does not deﬁne a
function, since one value of x can give rise to two values of y. It is, of course, possible
to specify the range of y and obtain, in this case, two functions, one for y  1 and the
other for y  1.
This graphical method of studying the problem was ﬁrst used in the study of predator–
prey relations in ﬁsh stocks by Volterra. It is sometimes called Volterra’s method. In
that context the closed curve solution indicated the periodic nature of the ﬁsh stocks.
In MATLAB, using the Symbolic Math Toolbox, commands for plotting the graph
of an implicitly deﬁned function f = f(x, y) = 0 are
ezplot(f) plots f(x, y) = 0 over the default domain −2π  x  2π, 
−2π  y  2π
ezplot(f, [xmin, xmax ,ymin ,ymax]) plots f(x, y) = 0 over
xmin  x  xmax, ymin  y  ymax
ezplot(f,[min,max]) plots f(x, y) = 0 over min  x  max and
min  y  max
If f is a function of the two variables u and v (rather than x and y) then the domain
end points umin, umax, vmin and vmax are sorted alphabetically.
Check that the commands
syms x y
ezplot(x*y*exp(2 – y) - 2*exp(x – 1),[0,3])
return the plot of Figure 2.94 and that the commands
syms x y

return a plot similar to Figure 2.68.

Piecewise deﬁned functions
Such functions often occur in the mathematical models of practical problems. For
example, friction always opposes the motion of an object, so that the force F is −R when
the velocity v is positive and +R when the velocity is negative. To represent the force,
we can write
F = −R sgn(v)
where sgn is the abbreviation for the signum function deﬁned by
and shown in Figure 2.95. The signum function is used in modelling relays.
The Heaviside unit step function is often used in modelling physical systems. It is
deﬁned by
(2.45)
and its graph is shown in Figure 2.96.
Three other useful functions of this type are the ﬂoor function 8x9, the ceiling 
function 6x7 and the fractional-part function FRACPT (x). (In older textbooks 8x9
is denoted by [x] and is sometimes called the integer-part function.) These are 
deﬁned by
8x9 = greatest integer not greater than x
(2.46)
6x7 = least integer not less than x
(2.47)
and
FRACPT(x) = x −8x9
(2.48)
These deﬁnitions need to be interpreted with care. Notice, for example, that
83.439 = 3
while
8−3.439 = −4
Similarly,
FRACPT(3.43) = 0.43
and
FRACPT(−3.43) = 0.57
The graphs of these functions are shown in Figure 2.97.

Care must be exercised when using the integer-part and fractional-part functions. Some
calculators and computer implementations are different from the above deﬁnitions.
Example 2.65
Sketch the graphs of the functions with formula y = f(x), where f(x) is
(a) H(x −1) −H(x −2)
(b) 8x9 −28 x9
Solution
(a) From the deﬁnition (2.45) of the Heaviside unit function H(x) as
the effect of composing it with the linear function f(x) = x −1 is to shift its graph one
unit to the right, as shown in Figure 2.98(a). Similarly, H(x −2) has the same graph as
H(x), but shifted two units to the right (Figure 2.98(b)). Combining the graphs in
Figures 2.98(a) and (b), we can ﬁnd the graph of their difference, H(x −1) −H(x −2),
as illustrated in Figure 2.98(c). Analytically, we can write this as

In MATLAB the Heaviside step, ﬂoor and ceiling functions are denoted by
Heaviside(x), ﬂoor(x) and ceil(x) respectively. The FRACPT function 
may then be denoted by x–ﬂoor(x). For example, taking x = −3.43 then
ﬂoor(–3.43)
returns the answer –4
ceil(–3.43)
returns the answer –3
FRACPT = –3.43 – ﬂoor(–3.43) returns the answer 0.5700
In symbolic form using Symbolic Math Toolbox we have
x = sym(–3.43);
ﬂoor(x)
returns –4
ceil(x)
returns –3
FRACPT = x – ﬂoor(x) returns 57/100

Numerical evaluation of functions
The introduction of calculators has greatly eased the burden of the numerical evaluation
of functions. Often, however, the functions encountered in solving practical problems
are not standard ones, and we have to devise methods of representing them numerically.
The simplest method is to use a graph, a second method is to draw up a table of values
of the function, and the third method is to give an analytical approximation to the 
function in terms of simpler functions. To illustrate this, consider the function e−x. We
can represent this by a graph, as shown in Figure 2.100.
To evaluate the function for a given value of x, we read the corresponding value of
y from the graph. For example, x = 0.322 gives y = 0.73 or thereabouts. Alternatively,
we can tabulate the function, as shown in Figure 2.101. Note that the notation 
x = 0.00(0.05)0.50 means for x from 0.00 to 0.50 in steps of 0.05.

Figure 2.101
Table of e−x values for
x = 0.00(0.05)0.50.

To evaluate the function for a given value of x, we interpolate linearly within the
table of values, to obtain the value of y. For example, x = 0.322 gives
= 0.7408 + (0.44)(−0.0361) = 0.7480 −0.015 884
= 0.7249
Another way of representing the function is to use the approximation
which will be obtained in Section 7.11, Example 7.38. Setting x = 0.322 gives
= 0.724 70 . . .
The question remains as to how accurate these representations of the function are. 
The graphical method of representation has within it an implicit error bound. When 
we read the graph, we make a judgement about the number of signiﬁcant digits in the
answer. In the other two methods it is more difﬁcult to assess the error – but it is also
more important, since it is easy to write down more digits than can be justiﬁed. Are 
the answers correct to one decimal place or two, or how many? We shall discuss the
accuracy of the tabular representation now and defer the algebraic approximation case
until Section 7.11.
2.9.1
Tabulated functions and interpolation
To estimate the error involved in evaluating a function from a table of values as above,
we need to look more closely at the process involved. Essentially the process assumes
that the function behaves like a straight line between tabular points, as illustrated in
Figure 2.102. Consequently it is called linear interpolation. The error involved depends
on how closely a linear function approximates the function between tabular points, and
this in turn depends on how close the tabular points are.
If the distance h between tabular points is sufﬁciently small, most functions arising
from applications of mathematics behave locally like linear functions; that is to say, the
error involved in approximating to the function between tabular points by a linear func-
tion is less than a rounding error. (Note that we have to use a different linear function

between each consecutive pair of values of the function. We have a piecewise-linear
approximation.) This, however, is a qualitative description of the process, and we need
a quantitative description. In general, consider the function f(x) with values fi = f(xi)
where xi = x0 + ih, i = 0, 1, 2, … , n. To calculate the value f(x) at a non-tabular point,
where x = xi + θh and 0  θ  1, using linear interpolation, we have
(2.49)
as shown in Figure 2.103.
The formula (2.49) may be written in a number of different ways, but it always gives
the same numerical result. The form used will depend on the computational context.
Thus we may write
f(x) ≈fi + θ( fi+1 − fi),
where  
(2.50)
or
(Lagrange’s form)
(2.51)
The difference fi+1 −fi between successive values in the table is often denoted by ∆fi, 
so that (2.49) may be rewritten as
f(x) ≈fi + θ∆fi
Example 2.66
Use linear interpolation and the data of Figure 2.101 to estimate the value of
(a) e−x where x = 0.235
(b) x where e−x = 0.7107
Solution
(a) From the table of values in Figure 2.101 we see that x = 0.235 lies between the tabular
points x = 0.20 and x = 0.25. Applying the formula (2.49) with xi = 0.20, xi+1 = 0.25, 
fi = 0.8187 and fi+1 = 0.7788 we have
(b) From the table of values we see that e−x = 0.7107 occurs between x = 0.30 and 
x = 0.35. Thus the value of x is given, using formula (2.49), by the equation

The difﬁculty with both the estimates obtained in Example 2.66 is that we do not 
know how accurate the answers are. Are they correct to 4dp or 3dp or less? The size of
the error in the answer depends on the curvature of the function. Because any linear
interpolation formula is, by deﬁnition, a straight line it cannot reﬂect the curvature of
the function it is trying to model. In order to model curvature a parabola is required,
that is a quadratic interpolating function. The difference between the quadratic inter-
polation formula and the linear formula will give us a measure of the accuracy of the
linear formula. We have
function value = linear interpolation value + C1
and
function value = quadratic interpolation value + C2
where ideally C2 is very much smaller than C1. Subtracting these equations we see that
C1 ≈quadratic interpolation value – linear interpolation value
Now to determine a quadratic function we require three points. Using formula (2.11)
obtained earlier, we see that the quadratic function which passes through (xi, fi), 
(xi+1, fi+1) and (xi+2, fi+2) may be expressed as
We can simplify p(x), when the data points are equally spaced, by remembering that 
xi +2 = xi + 2h, xi +1 = xi + h and x = xi + θh, with 0  θ  1, giving
This formula looks intimidatingly unlike that for linear interpolation, but, after some
rearrangement, we have
p(x) = [ fi + θ( fi +1 − fi)] +
(θ −1)( fi+2 −2fi+1 + fi)
= [ fi + θ∆fi] +
(θ −1)(∆fi+1 − ∆fi)
where 0  θ  1. Here the term in square brackets is the linear interpolation approxi-
mation to f(x), so that
(θ −1)(∆fi +1 −∆fi)
is the quadratic correction for that approximation (remember: the correction is added 
to eliminate the error). Note that this involves the difference of two successive differ-
ences, so we may write it as
(θ −1)∆2fi, where ∆2fi = ∆(∆fi) = ∆fi+1 −∆fi.

Error in linear interpolation
We can use this to estimate the error in linear interpolation for a function. If
f(x) ≈fi + θ∆fi +
(θ −1)∆2 fi
in the interval [xi, xi+1] then the error in using the linear interpolation
f(x) ≈fi + θ∆fi
will be approximately
(θ −1)∆2fi, and an estimate of the error bound of the linear
approximation is given by
Now θ(θ −1) = (θ −
)2 −
, so that 
, and our estimate of the error
bound is
|∆2fi|
For accurate linear interpolation we require this error bound to be less than a rounding
error. That is, it must be less than 
unit in the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure. This implies
|∆2 fi| 
unit of least signiﬁcant ﬁgure
giving the condition
|∆2 fi|  4 units of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure
for linear interpolation to yield answers as accurate as those in the original table.
Thus, from the table of values of the function e−x shown in Figure 2.101 we can 
construct the table shown in Figure 2.104. The ﬁnal row shows the estimate of the 
maximum error incurred in linear interpolation within each interval [xi, xi+1]. In order to
complete the table with error estimates for the intervals [0.00, 0.05] and [0.45, 0.50],
we need values of e−x for x = −0.05 and 0.55. From the information we have in 
Figure 2.103 we can say that the largest error likely in using linear interpolation 
from this table of 11 values of e−x is approximately 3 units in the fourth decimal place.
Values obtained could therefore safely be quoted to 3dp.
Critical tables
An ordinary table of values uses equally spaced values of the independent variable 
and tabulates the corresponding values of the dependent variable (the function values).

A critical table gives the function values at equal intervals, usually a unit of the last
decimal place, and then tabulates the limits between which the independent variable gives
each value. Thus, for example, cos x° = 0.999 for 1.82  x  3.14 and cos x° = 0.998
for 3.14  x  4.06 and so on. Thus we obtain the table of values shown in Figure 2.105.
If a value of the independent variable falls between two tabular values, the value of 
the dependent variable is that printed between these values. Thus cos 2.62° = 0.999.
The advantages of critical tables are that they do not require interpolation, they always
give answers that are accurate to within half a unit of the last decimal place and they
require less space.

Engineering application: a design problem
Mathematics plays an important role in engineering design. We shall illustrate how
some of the elementary ideas described in this chapter are used to produce optimal
designs. Consider the open container shown in Figure 2.106. The base and long sides
are constructed from material of thickness tcm and the short sides from material of
thickness 3t cm. The internal dimensions of the container are l cm × b cm × h cm. The
design problem is to produce a container of a given capacity that uses the least amount
of material. (Mass production of such items implies that small savings on individual
items produce large savings in the bulk product.) First we obtain an expression for the
volume A of material used in the manufacture of the container.
Figure 2.106
The capacity C of the box is C(l, b, h) = lbh. Then
A(l, b, h, t) = C(l + 6t, b + 2t, h + t) −C(l, b, h)
= (l + 6t)(b + 2t)(h + t) −lbh
= (lb + 6bh + 2hl)t + (2l + 6b + 12h)t2 + 12t3
(2.52)
For a speciﬁc design the thickness t of the material and the capacity K of the container
would be speciﬁed, so, since lbh = K, we can deﬁne one of the variables l, b and h in
terms of the other two. For example l = K/bh.
For various reasons, for example, ease of handling, marketing display and so on, the
manufacturer may impose other constraints on the design. We shall illustrate this by
ﬁrst considering a special case, and then look at the more general case.
Special case
Let us seek the optimal design of a container whose breadth b is four times its height h
and whose capacity is 10000cm3, using material of thickness 0.4cm and 1.2cm (so 
that t = 0.4). The function f(h) that we wish to minimize is given by A(l, b, h, t), where
t = 0.4, b = 4h and lbh = 10000 (so that l = 2500/h2). Substituting these values in (2.52)
gives, after some rearrangement,
f(h) = 9.6h2 + 5.76h + 0.768 + 6000/h + 800/h2
The graph of this function is shown in Figure 2.107. The graph has a minimum point
near h = 7. We can obtain a better estimate for the optimal choice for h by approxim-
ating f(h) locally by a quadratic function. Evaluating f at h = 6, 7 and 8 gives
Figure 2.107

f(6) = 1403.2, f(7) = 1385.0, f(8) = 1423.7
This shows clearly that the minimum value occurs between h = 6 and h = 8.
We approximate to f(h) using a local quadratic approximation of the form
f(h)  A(h −7)2 + B(h −7) + C
Setting h = 7 gives
C = 1385.0
Setting h = 6 gives
A −B + C = 1403.2
Setting h = 8 gives
A + B + C = 1423.7
Hence C = 1385.0, A = 28.45 and B = 10.25. The minimum of the approximating
quadratic function occurs where h −7 = −B/(2A), that is, at h = 7 −0.18 = 6.82. Thus
the optimal choice for h is approximately 6.82 giving a value for f(h) at that point of
1383.5.
The corresponding values for b and l are b = 27.3 and l = 53.7. Thus we have
obtained an optimal design of the container in this special case.
General case
Here we seek the optimal design without restricting the ratio of b to h. For a container
of capacity K, we have to minimize A(l, b, h, t) subject to the constraint C(l, b, h) = K.
Here
A(l, b, h, t) = (lb + 6bh + 2hl)t + (2l + 6b + 12h)t2 + 12t3
and
C(l, b, h) = lbh
These functions have certain algebraic symmetries that enable us to solve the problem
algebraically. Consider the formula for A and set x = 2h and y = l/3, then
A(l, b, h, t) = 3(by + bx + xy)t + 6(y + b + x)t2 + 12t3
= A*(y, b, x, t)
and
C(l, b, h) = 3bxy/2
From this we can conclude that if A*(y, b, x, t) has a minimum value at (y0, b0, x0) 
for a given value of t, then it has the same value at (x0, b0, y0), (x0, y0, b0), (y0, x0, b0),
(b0, y0, x0) and (b0, x0, y0). Assuming that the function has a unique minimum point, we
conclude that these six points are the same, that is b0 = y0 = x0. Thus we deduce that the
minimum occurs where l = 6h and b = 2h. Since the capacity is ﬁxed, we have lbh = K,
which implies that 12h3 = K.
Thus the optimal choice for h in the general case is (
K)1/3.
Returning to the special case where K = 10 000 and t = 0.4, we obtain an optimal
design when
h = 9.41,
b = 18.82,
l = 56.46
using 1330.1 cm3 of material. Note that the amount of material used is close to that used
in the special case where b = 4h. This indicates that the design is not sensitive to small
errors made during its construction.

Engineering application: an optimization problem
A company owns two mines: mine X produces 1 ton of high grade ore, 3 tons of
medium grade ore and 5 tons of low grade ore each day while mine Y produces 2 tons
of each grade ore each day. The company needs 80 tons of high, 160 tons of medium
and 200 tons of low grade ore. It costs £2000 a day to operate each mine. How many
days should each mine be operated to minimize the cost?
We can summarize the information using a table:

Running X for x days and Y for y days to meet the requirements gives the inequalities
x + 2y  80
3x + 2y  160
5x + 2y  200
with the associated cost C = 2000x + 2000y. Also we know that x  0 and y  0.
The set of feasible solutions is shown tinted in Figure 2.108. The feasible costs are
also shown in the diagram. They are represented by lines parallel to x + y = C/2000. The
minimum cost is given by the cost line closest to the origin. This is the line that passes
through the point A(40, 20).
Thus the company should operate mine X for 40 days and mine Y for 20 days to
minimize the cost. This is an example of optimization using linear programming.

COMPLEX NUMBERS
3.1
Introduction
Complex numbers ﬁrst arose in the solution of cubic equations in the sixteenth century
using a method known as Cardano’s solution. This gives the solution of the equation
x3 + qx + r = 0
as
which may be veriﬁed by direct substitution. This solution gave difﬁculties when it
unexpectedly involved square roots of negative numbers. For example, the equation
x3 −15x −4 = 0
was known to have three roots. An obvious one is x = 4, but the corresponding root
obtained using the formula was
x = 3÷[2 + ÷(−121)] + 3÷[2 −÷(−121)]
Writing in 1572, Bombelli showed that
2 + ÷(−121) = [2 + ÷(−1)]3
and
2 −÷(−121) = [2 −÷(−1)]3
and so
x = [2 + ÷(−1)] + [2 −÷(−1)] = 4
as expected. Since
÷(−x) = ÷(−1)÷x
where x is a positive number, the square roots of negative numbers can be represented
as a number multiplied by ÷(−1). Thus ÷(−121) = 11÷(−1), ÷(−4900) = 70÷(−1) and so
on. Because the introduction of the special number ÷(−1) simpliﬁed calculations, it
quickly gained acceptance by mathematicians. Denoting ÷(−1) by the letter j, we obtain
the general number z where
z = x + jy
Here x and y are ordinary real numbers and obey the Fundamental Rules of
Arithmetic. (Most mathematics and physics texts use the letter i instead of j. However,
we shall follow the standard engineering practice and use j.) The number z is called a
complex number. The ordinary processes of arithmetic still apply, but become a little
more complicated. As well as simplifying the process of obtaining roots as above, the
introduction of j = ÷(−1) simpliﬁed the theory of equations, so that, for example, the
quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0
always has two roots

These roots are real numbers when b2  4ac and complex numbers when b2  4ac.
Thus, any irreducible quadratic (see Section 2.3.4) may be factorized into two complex
factors. Thus x2 + 2x + 5 = (x + 1 + j2)(x + 1 −j2). It then follows from property (ii) 
of the polynomial functions, given in Section 2.4.1, that any polynomial equation of
degree n having real coefﬁcients has exactly n roots which may be real or complex.
This is a result known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which is also valid
for polynomial equations having complex coefﬁcients. Thus
x7 −7x5 −6x4 + 4x3 −28x −24 = 0
is an equation of degree seven and has the seven roots
x = −1, −2, −3, −1 −j, −1 + j, 1 −j, 1 + j
As has often been the case, what began as a mathematical curiosity has turned out to
be of considerable practical importance, and complex numbers are invaluable in many
aspects of engineering analysis. An elementary, but important, application is discussed
later in this chapter.
3.2
Properties
To specify a complex number z, we use two real numbers, x and y, and write
z = x + jy
where j = ÷(−1), and x is called the real part of z and y its imaginary part. This is often
abbreviated to
z = x + jy,
where x = Re(z) and y = Im(z)
Note that the imaginary part of z does not include the j. For example, if z = 3 −j2 then
Re(z) = 3 and Im(z) = −2. If x = 0, the complex number is said to be purely imaginary
and if y = 0 it is said to be purely real.
3.2.1
The Argand diagram
Geometrically, complex numbers can be represented as points on a plane similar to the
way in which real numbers are represented by points on a straight line (see Section
1.2.1). The number z = x + jy is represented by the point P with coordinates (x, y), as
shown in Figure 3.1. Such a diagram is called an Argand diagram, after one of its
inventors. The x axis is called the real axis and the y axis is called the imaginary axis.

z = x + jy.

The arithmetic of complex numbers
(i) Equality
If two complex numbers z1 = x1 + jy1 and z2 = x2 + jy2 are equal then they are represented
by the same point on the Argand diagram and it clearly follows that
x1 = x2
and
y1 = y2
That is, when two complex numbers are equal we can equate their respective real and
imaginary parts.
Example 3.2
If the two complex numbers
z1 = (3a + 2) + j(3b −1)
and
z2 = (b + 1) −j(a + 2 −b)
are equal
(a) ﬁnd the values of the real numbers a and b;
(b) write down the real and imaginary parts of z1 and z2.

3.2 PROPERTIES
189
Solution
(a) Since z1 = z2 we can equate their respective real and imaginary parts, giving
(3a + 2) = (b + 1)
or
3a −b = −1
and
(3b −1) = −(a + 2 −b)
or
a + 2b = −1
Solving for a and b then gives
a =
,
b =
(b)
(ii) Addition and subtraction
To add or subtract two complex numbers, we simply perform the operations on their
corresponding real and imaginary parts. In general, if z1 = x1 + jy1 and z2 = x2 + jy2 then
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2) + j(y1 + y2)
and
z1 −z2 = (x1 −x2) + j(y1 −y2)
In Section 4.2.5 we shall interpret complex numbers geometrically as two-dimensional
vectors and illustrate how the rules for the addition of vectors can be used to represent
addition of complex numbers in the Argand diagram.

If z1 = 3 + j2
and
z2 = 5 −j3 determine
(a) z1 + z2
(b) z1 −z2
Solution
(a) Adding the corresponding real and imaginary parts gives
z1 + z2 = (3 + 5) + j(2 −3) = 8 −j1
(b) Subtracting the corresponding real and imaginary parts gives
z1 −z2 = (3 −5) + j(2 −(−3)) = −2 + j5

When multiplying two complex numbers the normal rules for multiplying out brackets
hold. Thus, in general, if z1 = x1 + jy1 and z2 = x2 + jy2 then

COMPLEX NUMBERS
z1z2 = (x1 + jy1)(x2 + jy2)
= x1x2 + jy1x2 + jx1y2 + j2y1y2
Making use of the fact that j2 = −1 then gives
z1z2 = x1x2 −y1y2 + j(x1y2 + x2 y1)
Example 3.4
If z1 = 3 + j2
and
z2 = 5 + j3 determine z1z2.
Solution
z1z2 = (3 + j2)(5 + j3) = 15 + j10 + j9 + j26
= 15 −6 + j(10 + 9), using the fact that j2 = −1
= 9 + j19
(iv) Division
The division of two complex numbers is less straightforward. If z1 = x1 + jy1 and 
z2 = x2 + jy2, then we use the following technique to obtain the quotient. We multiply
‘top and bottom’ by x2 −jy2, giving
Multiplying out ‘top and bottom’, we obtain
giving
The number x −jy is called the complex conjugate of z = x + jy and is denoted by z*.
(Sometimes the complex conjugate is denoted with an overbar as z.) Note that the 
complex conjugate z* is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part of z.
Example 3.5
If z1 = 3 + j2
and
z2 = 5 + j3

Multiplying ‘top and bottom’ by the conjugate 5 −j3 of the denominator gives

Complex conjugate
As we have seen above, the complex conjugate of z = x + jy is z* = x −jy. In the Argand
diagram z* is the mirror image of z in the real or x axis. The following important 
results are readily deduced.
z + z* = 2x = 2 Re(z)
z −z* = 2jy = 2jIm(z)
(3.1)
zz* = (x + jy)(x −jy) = x2 + y2
(z1z2)* = z 1*z 2*
with the next to last result indicating that the product of a complex number and its 
complex conjugate is a real number.
The zeros of an irreducible quadratic function, which has real coefﬁcients, are 
complex conjugates of each other.
Example 3.7
Express the zeros of f(x) = x 2 −6x + 13 as complex numbers.

The zeros of f(x) are the roots of the equation

COMPLEX NUMBERS
Using the quadratic formula (1.8) we obtain
So the two zeros form a conjugate pair.
Example 3.8
Find all the roots of the quartic equation
x 4 + 4x 2 + 16 = 0
Solution
Rewriting the equation we can achieve a difference of squares which makes possible a
ﬁrst factorization
x 4 + 8x 2 + 16 −4x 2 = (x 2 + 4)2 −4x 2
= [(x 2 + 4) −2x][(x 2 + 4) + 2x]
Now x 2 −2x + 4 = (x −1)2 + 3 and x 2 + 2x + 4 = (x + 1)2 + 3, so we obtain the equations
x −1 = ±j√3
and
x + 1 = ±j√3
and the four roots of the quartic equation are
x = 1 + j√3, 1 −j√3, −1 + j√3, −1 −j√3
These roots form two conjugate pairs.
Example 3.9
For the complex numbers z1 = 5 + j3 and z2 = 3 −j2 verify the identity
(z1z2)* = z 1*z 2*
Solution
z1z2 = (5 + j3)(3 −j2) = 15 + 6 + j(9 −10) = 21 −j
(z1z2)* = 21 + j
z 1*z 2* = (5 −j3)(3 + j2) = 15 + 6 + j(10 −9) = 21 + j
Thus (z1z2)* = z 1*z 2*.
3.2.4
Modulus and argument
As indicated in the Argand diagram of Figure 3.3, the point P is speciﬁed uniquely if
we know the length of the line OP and the angle it makes with the positive x direction.
The length of OP is a measure of the size of z and is called the modulus of z, which is
usually denoted by mod z or |z |. The angle between the positive real axis and OP is
called the argument of z and is denoted by arg z. Since the polar coordinates (r, θ) and
(r, θ + 2π) represent the same point, a convention is used to determine the argument

of z uniquely, restricting its range so that −π  arg z  π. (In some textbooks this 
is referred to as the ‘principal value’ of the argument.) The argument of the complex
number 0 + j0 is not deﬁned.
Thus from Figure 3.3, |z | and arg z are given by
(3.2)
Note that from equations (3.1)
zz* = x2 + y2 = | z |2
There are two common mistakes to avoid when calculating | z | and arg z using (3.2).
First note that the modulus of z is the square root of the sum of squares of x and y, not
of x and jy. The j part of the number has been accounted for in the representation of the
Argand diagram. The second common mistake is to place θ in the wrong quadrant. To
avoid this, it is advisable when evaluating arg z to draw a sketch of the Argand diagram
showing the location of the number.
Example 3.10
Determine the modulus and argument of
(a) 3 + j2
(b) 1 −j

MATLAB handles complex numbers automatically. Either i or j can be used to
denote the imaginary part, but in any output to a command, MATLAB will always
use i. Consequently, to avoid confusion i will be used throughout when using
MATLAB, so, for example, the complex number z = 4 + j3 will be entered as:
z = 4 + 3i
Note that the i is located after the number 3 and there is no need to insert the 
multiplication sign * between the 3 and the i (if it is located before then * must 
be included). However, in some cases it is necessary to insert *; for example, the
complex number
must be entered as
z = –1/2 + (1/2)*i
MAPLE is similar to MATLAB in dealing with complex numbers, except it uses I
and * is always required.
The complex conjugate z* of a complex number z is obtained using the command
conj; for example, to obtain the conjugate of z = 4 + j3 enter the commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
z = 4 + 3i;
z:= 4 + 3*I;
zbar = conj(z)
zbar:= conjugate(z);
which return
zbar = 4 - 3i
zbar = 4 - 3I
The arithmetical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are
carried out by the standard operators +, –, *, and / respectively. For example, if 
z1 = 4 + j3 and z2 = −3 + j2 then z3 = z1 + z2 and z4 = z1/z2 are determined as follows:
MATLAB
MAPLE
z1 = 4 + 3i; 
z1:= 4 + 3*I; 
z2 = -3 + 2i;
z2:= -3 + 2*I;
z3 = z1 + z2
z3:= z1 + z2;
return
z3 = 1.0000 + 5.0000i
z3 = 1 + 5I
and the further command
z4 = z1/z2
z4:= z1/z2;
returns
z4 = –0.4615 – 1.3077i
z4:= – 6––

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number are determined using the 
commands real and imag respectively. Considering Example 3.6 the MATLAB
commands
z = (2 + i)/(1 – i); z1 = z + 1/z;
real(z1)
return the answer 0.7000 and the further command
imag(z1)
returns the answer 0.9000, thus conﬁrming the answers obtained in the given solu-
tion. MAPLE uses Re and Im.
To represent complex numbers as points on an Argand diagram check that the
following commands reafﬁrm the solution given in Example 3.1:
z1 = 3 + 2i; x = real(z1); y = imag(z1);
plot(x,y,’*’)
xlabel(‘x = Re(z)’)
ylabel(‘y = Im(z)’)
hold on
plot([–6,9],[0,0], ‘k’)
plot([0,0],[–6,4], ‘k’)
z2 = –5 + 3i; x = real(z2); y = imag(z2);

z3 = 8 – 5i; x = real(z3); y = imag(z3);
plot(x,y, ‘*’)
z4 = –2 – 3i; x = real(z4); y = imag(z4);
plot(x,y, ‘*’)
To label the points add the additional commands
text(3.2,2 ‘A(3,2)’)
text(–5,3.3, ‘B(–5,3)’)
text(8.2,–5, ‘C(8,–5)’)
text(–2,–3.3, ‘D(–2,3)’)
plot(x,y,’*’)
hold off

196
COMPLEX NUMBERS
[Note: (1) The ‘*’ in the plot commands means that the point will be printed as an
asterisk; alternatives include ‘.’, ‘x’ and ‘+’.
(2) The hold on command holds the current axes for subsequent plots.
(3) The two plot commands following the hold on command draw the x
and y axes with the entry k indicating that the lines are drawn in black
(alternatives include b for blue, r for red and g for green).]
Symbolically the MATLAB commands
syms x y real
z = x + i*y
create symbolic variables x and y that have the additional property that they are real.
Then z is a complex variable and can be manipulated as such. For example
conj(z) returns x – i*y and expand(z*conj(z)) returns x^2 + y^2
The modulus and argument (measured in radians) of a complex number z can be 
calculated directly using the commands abs and angle respectively (abs and
argument in MAPLE). For example, considering Example 3.10(a) the commands
z = 3 + 2i;
modz = abs(z)
return
modz = 3.6056
and the additional command
argz = angle(z)
returns
argz = 0.5880

the answers to Examples 3.10(b)–(d).

Polar form of a complex number
Figure 3.3 on page 193 shows that the relationships between (x, y) and (r, θ) are
x = r cosθ
and
y = r sinθ
Hence the complex number z = x + jy can be expressed in the form
z = r cosθ + jr sinθ = r(cosθ + jsin θ)
(3.3)
This is called the polar form of the complex number. In engineering it is frequently
written as r ∠θ, so that
z = r ∠θ = r(cosθ + jsin θ)

198
COMPLEX NUMBERS
Example 3.11
Express the following complex numbers in polar form.
(a) 12 + j5
(b) −3 + j4
(c) −4 −j3
Solution
(a) A sketch of the Argand diagram locating the position of 12 + j5 is given in 
Figure 3.5(a). Thus
| 12 + j5 | = ÷(144 + 25) = 13
arg(12 + j5) = tan−1
= 0.395
Thus in polar form
12 + j5 = 13[cos(0.395) + jsin(0.395)]
(b) A sketch of the Argand diagram locating the position of −3 + j4 is given in 
Figure 3.5(b). Thus
|−3 + j4 | = ÷(9 + 16) = 5
arg(−3 + j4) = π −tan−1
= π −0.9273
= 2.214
Thus in polar form
−3 + j4 = 5[cos(2.214) + jsin(2.214)]
(c) A sketch of the Argand diagram locating the position of −4 −j3 is given in 
Figure 3.5(c). Thus
|−4 −j3 | = ÷(16 + 9) = 5
arg(−4 −j3) = −(π −tan−1 ) = −(π −0.643)
= −2.498
Thus in polar form
−4 −j3 = 5[cos(−2.498) + j sin (−2.498)] 
= 5[cos(2.498) −jsin(2.498)]
using the results cos(−t) = cos t and sin(−t) = −sin t.
Note: Rectangular to polar conversion can be done using a calculator and students are
encouraged to check the answers in this way.
Multiplication in polar form
Let
z1 = r1(cosθ1 + jsinθ1)
and
z2 = r2(cosθ2 + jsin θ2)

which, on using the trigonometric identities (2.24a, c), gives
z1z2 = r1r2[cos(θ1 + θ2) + jsin(θ1 + θ2)]
(3.4)
Hence
| z1z2 | = r1r2 = | z1 ||z2|
(3.5a)
and
arg(z1z2) = θ1 + θ2 = arg z1 + arg z2
(3.5b)
When using these results, care must be taken to ensure that −π  arg(z1z2)  π.
Example 3.12
If z1 = −12 + j5 and z2 = −4 + j3, determine, using (3.5a) and (3.5b), | z1z2 | and arg(z1z2).
Solution
| z1 | = ÷(144 + 25) = ÷(169) = 13
arg(z1) = π −tan−1
= π −0.395 = 2.747
| z2 | = ÷(16 + 9) = 5
arg(z2) = π −tan−1
= 2.498
Thus from (3.4) and (3.5)
| z1z2 | = | z1 ||z2| = (13)(5) = 65
arg(z1z2) = arg z1 + arg z2 = 2.747 + 2.498 
= 5.245 (or 300.51°)
However, this does not express arg(z1z2) within the deﬁned range −π  arg  π. Thus 
arg(z1z2) = −2π + 5.245 = −1.038
Geometrical representation of multiplication by j
Since
z = r(cosθ + jsinθ)
and
j = 1(cos
π + jsin
π)
it follows from (3.4) that
jz = r[cos(θ +
π) + jsin(θ +
π)]
Thus the effect of multiplying a complex number by j is to leave the modulus unaltered
but to increase the argument by π, as indicated in Figure 3.6. This property is of import-
ance in the application of complex numbers to the theory of alternating current.

since
cos2θ + sin2θ = 1
Thus if
z1 = r1(cosθ1 + jsinθ1)
and
z2 = r2(cosθ2 + jsin θ2)
then
=
(cosθ1 + jsinθ1)(cos θ2 −jsinθ2)
(from above)
=
[(cosθ1 cosθ2 + sinθ1sinθ2) + j(sinθ1 cosθ2 −cosθ1 sinθ2)]
or
[cos(θ1 −θ2) + jsin(θ1 −θ2)]
(3.6)
using the trigonometric identities (2.25b, d). Hence
(3.7)
and
= θ1 −θ2 = arg z1 −arg z2
(3.8)
Again some adjustment may be necessary to ensure that −π  arg(z1/z2)  π.

3.2.7
Euler’s formula
In Section 2.7.3 we obtained the result
ex = cosh x + sinh x
which links the exponential and hyperbolic functions. A similar, but more important,
formula links the exponential and circular functions. It is
e jθ = cosθ + jsin θ
(3.9)
This formula is known as Euler’s formula. The justiﬁcation for this deﬁnition depends
on the following facts.
We know from the properties of the exponential function that
When expressed in terms of Euler’s formula this becomes
(cos θ1 + jsinθ1)(cos θ2 + jsinθ2) = cos(θ1 + θ2) + jsin(θ1 + θ2)
which is just (3.4) with r1 = r2 = 1.
Similarly
becomes
which is just (3.6) with r1 = r2 = 1.
Euler’s formula enables us to write down the polar form of the complex number z
very concisely:
z = r(cosθ + jsinθ) = re jθ = r ∠θ
(3.10)
This is known as the exponential form of the complex number z.
Example 3.15
Express the following complex numbers in exponential form:
(a) 2 + j3
(b) −2 + j
Solution
(a) A sketch of the Argand diagram showing the position of 2 + j3 is given in 
Figure 3.7(a).
| 2 + j3 | = ÷(22 + 32) = ÷13
arg(2 + j3) = tan−1(3/2) = 0.9828
Thus 2 + j3 = ÷13ej0.9828
(b) A sketch of the Argand diagram showing the position of −2 + j is given in 
Figure 3.7(b).

Express in cartesian form the complex number e2+jπ/3.
Solution
e2+jπ/3 = e2ejπ/3 = e2(cos π/3 + j sin π/3)
Now e2 = 7.3891, cos π/3 = 0.5 and sin π/3 = 0.8660, so that
e2+jπ/3 = 3.6945 + j6.3991

These relationships provide the justiﬁcation for Osborn’s rule used in Section 2.7.4 for
obtaining hyperbolic function identities from those satisﬁed by circular functions, since
whenever a product of two sines occurs, j2 will also occur.
Using these results we can evaluate functions such as sin z, cosz, tanz, sinh z, coshz
and tanh z. For example, to evaluate
cos z = cos(x + jy)
we use the identity
cos(A + B) = cos A cos B −sin A sin B
and obtain
cos z = cos x cos jy −sin x sin jy
Using results (3.14a, b), this gives
cos z = cos x cosh y −j sin x sinh y

Equating real and imaginary parts of each side of this equation gives
2 = cos x cosh y
and
0 = sin x sinh y
The latter equation implies either sin x = 0 or y = 0. If y = 0 then the ﬁrst equation
implies 2 = cos x, so clearly that is not a solution since x is a real number . The alter-
native, sin x = 0, implies x = 0, ±π, ±2π, ±3π, … , and hence
2 = cos(±nπ) cosh y,
n = 0, 1, 2, …
This gives
2 = cos nπ cosh y 
= (−1)n cosh y
But cosh y  1, so n must be an even number. Thus the values of z such that cos z = 2
are
z = ±2nπ ± j cosh−12, n = 0, 1, 2, …
= ±2nπ ± j(1.3170)
(e) Writing z = x + jy we obtain
tanh(x + jy) = 2
which implies
sinh(x + jy) = 2 cosh(x + jy)
Expanding both sides we have
sinh x cosh jy + cosh x sinh jy = 2 cosh x cosh jy + 2 sinh x sinh jy
or
sinh x cos y + j cosh x sin y = 2 cosh x cos y + 2j sinh x sin y
Equating real and imaginary parts we obtain
sinh x cos y = 2 cosh x cos y
cosh x sin y = 2 sinh x sin y.
Since sinh x ≠2 cosh x for real values of x, cos y = 0 so that
y = (2n + 1)π/2 for n = 0, ±1, ±2, …
This implies that sin y ≠0, so that tanh z = . Thus
z = tanh−1 + j

Logarithm of a complex number
Consider the equation
z = ew
Writing z = x + jy and w = u + jv, we have
x + jy = eu+jv = eue jv
= eu(cos v + j sin v),
by Euler’s formula
Equating real and imaginary parts,
x = eu cos v
and
y = eu sin v
Squaring both these equations and adding gives
x2 + y2 = e2u(cos2v + sin2v) = e2u
so that
u =
ln(x2 + y2) = ln | z |
Dividing the two equations,
From this and x = eu cos v
v = arg z + 2nπ,
n = 0, ±1, ±2, …
Hence
v = ln | z | + j arg z + j2nπ,
n = 0, ±1, ±2, …
We select just one of these solutions to deﬁne for us the logarithm of the complex 
number z, writing
ln z = ln | z | + j arg z
(3.15)
This is sometimes called its principal value.
Example 3.18
Evaluate ln(−3 + j4) in the form x + jy.
Solution
|−3 + j4 | = ÷(9 + 16) = 5
arg(−3 + j4) = π −tan−1
= 2.214
Thus from (3.15)

of a real variable. For example, in relation to Example 3.17 (a) and (b), entering
sin((pi/4)*(1 + i)) returns the answer 0.9366 + 0.6142i
whilst entering
sinh(3 + 4i) returns the answer –6.5481 – 7.6192i
conﬁrming the answers obtained in the given solution. Similarly, considering
Example 3.18, entering
log(–3 + 4i) returns the answer 1.6094 + 2.2143i
conﬁrming the answer obtained in the solution. In MAPLE, functions of a complex
variable must be evaluated using evalc. The result is exact and the numerical 
values require evalf; for example
evalc(sin((Pi/4)*(1 + I)));
returns
1–2÷2cosh(1–4π) +
1–2÷2Isinh(1–4π)
and evalf(%); returns 0.9366 + 0.6142I.

Powers of complex numbers
In earlier sections we have discussed the extensions of ordinary arithmetic, including 
+, −, ×, ÷, to complex numbers. We now extend the arithmetical operations to include
the operation of powers.
3.3.1
De Moivre’s theorem
From (3.10) a complex number z may be expressed in terms of its modulus r and 
argument θ in the exponential form
z = re jθ
Using the rules of indices and the property (2.33a) of the exponential function, we have,
for any n,
zn = r n(e jθ)n = r ne j(nθ )
so that
z n = r n(cos nθ + j sin nθ)
(3.16)
This result is known as de Moivre’s theorem.
Example 3.19
Express 1 −j in the form r(cosθ + j sinθ) and hence evaluate (1 −j)12.
Solution
From Example 3.7(b)
| 1 −j | = ÷2
and
arg(1 −j) = −
so that
1 −j = ÷2[cos(−
) + j sin(−
)]
= ÷2(cos
−j sin
)
Then
(1 −j)12 = (÷2)12(cos
−j sin
)12
which, on using de Moivre’s theorem (3.16), gives
(1 −j)12 = 26[cos(12 ×
) −j sin(12 ×
)]
= 26(cos 3π −j sin 3π)
= 26(−1 −j0)
= −64
Most commonly, we use de Moivre’s theorem to ﬁnd the roots of complex numbers like
÷z and 3÷z. More generally, we want to ﬁnd z1/n, the nth root, where n is a natural number.
Setting w = z1/n, we see that z = w n, and by (3.16),

wn = Rn(cos nφ + j sin nφ),
where | w | = R and arg w = φ
z = r(cosθ + j sinθ),
where | z | = r and arg z = θ
Comparing real and imaginary parts in the equality z = w n, we deduce that
r cosθ = Rn cos nφ
and
r sinθ = Rn sin nφ
Squaring and adding these two equations gives r2 = R2n; that is, R = r1/n. Substituting
this value into the equations gives
cosθ = cos nφ
and
sinθ = sin nφ
This pair of simultaneous equations has an inﬁnite number of solutions because of the
2π-periodicity of the sine and cosine functions. Thus
nφ = θ + 2πk,
where k is an integer
and
where k = 0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, −3, …
Substituting these values for R and φ into the formula for w gives
(3.17)
where k is an integer. This expression yields exactly n different roots, corresponding 
to k = 0, 1, 2, … , n −1. The value for k = n is the same as that for k = 0, the value for
k = n + 1 is the same as that for k = 1, and so on. The n values of z1/n are equally spaced
around a circle of radius r1/n whose centre is the origin of the Argand diagram. Also, the
arguments increase in arithmetic progression, so that joining the roots on the circle 
creates a regular polygon inscribed in the latter.
Equation (3.17) may be written alternatively in the exponential form
z1/n = r1/ne j(θ/n+2πk/n),
k = 0, 1, 2, … , n −1
(3.18)
Example 3.20
Given 
evaluate
(a) z1/2
(b) z1/3
and display the roots on an Argand diagram.
Solution
We ﬁrst express z in polar form. 
Since r = | z | = ÷
= 2−1/2, and θ = arg(z) = π −tan−11 =
, we have
z = 2−1/2(cos

COMPLEX NUMBERS
(a) From (3.17)
= 2−1/4[cos(
+ πk) + jsin(
+ πk)],
k = 0, 1
Thus we have two square roots:
z1/2 = 2−1/4(cos
+ jsin
)
(for k = 0)
and
z1/2 = 2−1/4(cos
+ jsin
)
(for k = 1)
as shown in Figure 3.8(a). These can be evaluated numerically, giving respectively (to
4dp) z = 0.3218 + j0.7769 and z = −0.3218 −j0.7769.
(b) From (3.17)
k = 0, 1, 2
= 2−1/6[cos(
+
) + jsin(
+
)],
k = 0, 1, 2
Thus we obtain three cube roots:
z1/3 = 2−1/6(cos
+ jsin
)
(for k = 0)
z1/3 = 2−1/6(cos
+ jsin
)
(for k = 1)
and
z1/3 = 2−1/6(cos
+ jsin
)
(for k = 2)
as shown in Figure 3.8(b). Note that the three roots are equally spaced around a circle
of radius 2−1/6 with centre at the origin.
Formula (3.17) can easily be extended to deal with the general rational power zp of z.

Now we need to determine (−15 −j8)1/2 so ﬁrst we express it in polar form. Since
|−15 −j8 | = ÷[(15)2 + (8)2] = 17
and from Figure 3.10
arg(−15 −j8) = −(π −tan−1
)
= −2.6516
we have
−15 −j8 = 17[cos(2.6516) −jsin(2.6516)]
From (3.17)
= (17)1/2[cos(1.3258 + πk) −j sin(1.3258 + πk)],
k = 0, 1
Thus we have the two square roots
(−15 −j8)1/2 = (17)1/2[cos(1.3258) −j sin(1.3258)] = 1 −j4
(for k = 0)
(the reader should verify that (1 −j4)2 = −15 −j8)
and
(−15 −j8)1/2 = (17)1/2[cos(4.4674) −j sin(4.4674)] = −1 + j4
(for k = 1)
Substituting back in (3.19) gives the roots of the quadratic as

which, on using (3.20a) with n = 5, 3 and 1, gives
cos5θ =
(2 cos 5θ + 10 cos 3θ + 20 cosθ) = 
(cos 5θ + 5 cos 3θ + 10 cosθ)
(b) Using (3.20b) with n = 1,
which, on noting that j6 = −1, gives
Using (3.20a) with n = 6, 4 and 2 then gives
sin6θ = −
(2 cos 6θ −12 cos 4θ + 30 cos 2θ −20)
=
(10 −15 cos 2θ + 6 cos 4θ −cos 6θ)
Conversely, de Moivre’s theorem may be used to expand cos nθ and sin nθ, where n is
a positive integer, as polynomials in cos θ and sin θ. From the theorem
cos nθ + j sin nθ = (cosθ + j sin θ)n
we obtain, writing s = sin θ and c = cosθ for convenience,

COMPLEX NUMBERS
Equating real and imaginary parts yields
and
Using the trigonometric identity cos2θ = 1 −sin2θ (so that c2 = 1 −s2), we see that
(a) cos nθ can be expanded in terms of (cos θ)n for any n or in terms of (sin θ)n if 
n is even;
(b) sin nθ can be expanded in terms of (sin θ)n if n is odd.
Example 3.24
Expand cos 4θ as a polynomial in cos θ.
Solution
By de Moivre’s theorem,
(cos 4θ + j sin 4θ) = (cosθ + j sinθ)4 = (c + js)4
= c4 + j4c3s + j26c2s2 + j34cs3 + j4s4
= c4 + j4c3s −6c2s2 −j4cs3 + s4
Equating real parts,
cos 4θ = c4 −6c2s2 + s4
which on using s2 = 1 −c2 gives
cos 4θ = c4 −6c2(1 −c2) + (1 −c2)2 = 8c4 −8c2 + 1
Thus
cos 4θ = 8 cos4θ −8 cos2θ + 1
Note that by equating imaginary parts we could have obtained a polynomial expansion
for sin 4θ.
In MATLAB, raising to a power is obtained using the standard operator ^. For 
example, considering Example 3.19, entering

In Example 3.22 the solution may be obtained symbolically using the solve

Loci in the complex plane
A locus (plural loci) is the set of points that have a speciﬁed property. For example, a
circle is the locus of the points in a plane that are a ﬁxed distance, its radius, from a
ﬁxed point, its centre. The property may be speciﬁed in words or algebraically. Loci
occur frequently in engineering contexts, from the design of safety guards around 
moving machinery to the design of aircraft wing sections. The Argand diagram repres-
entation of complex numbers as points on a plane often makes it possible to represent
complicated loci very concisely in terms of a complex variable, and this simpliﬁes the
engineering analysis. This occurs in a wide range of engineering problems, from the
water percolation through dams to the design of microelectronic devices.
3.4.1
Straight lines
There are many ways in which straight lines may be represented using complex numbers.
We will illustrate these with a number of examples.
Example 3.25
Describe the locus of z given by
(a) Re(z) = 4
(b) arg(z −1 −j) = π/4
(c)
(d) Im((1 −j2)z) = 3
Solution
(a) Here z = 4 + jy for any real y, so that the locus is the vertical straight line with 
equation x = 4 illustrated in Figure 3.11(a).
(b) Here z = 1 + j + r(cos π/4 + j sin π/4) for any positive ( 0) real number r, so that
the locus is a half-line making an angle π/4 with the positive x direction with the end
point (1, 1) excluded (since arg 0 is not deﬁned). Algebraically we can write it as y = x,
x  1, and it is illustrated in Figure 3.11(b).
(c) The equation, in this case, may be written
| z −j2 | = | z −1 |
Recalling the deﬁnition of modulus, we can rewrite this as
÷[x2 + (y −2)2] = ÷[(x −1)2 + y2]
Squaring both sides and multiplying out, we obtain
x2 + y2 −4y + 4 = x2 −2x + 1 + y2
which simpliﬁes to
the equation of a straight line.

Alternatively, we can interpret |z −j2 | as the distance on the Argand diagram from
the point 0 + j2 to the point z, and |z −1| as the distance from the point 1 + j0 to the
point z, so that
| z −j2 | = | z −1|
is the locus of points that are equidistant from the two ﬁxed points (0, 2) and (1, 0), as
shown in Figure 3.11(c).
(d) Writing z = x + jy,
(1 −j2)z = (1 −j2)(x + jy) = x + 2y + j(y −2x)
so that Im((1 −j2)z) = 3, implies y −2x = 3.
Thus Im((1 −j2)z) = 3 describes the straight line
y = 2x + 3
illustrated in Figure 3.11(d).
3.4.2
Circles
The simplest representation of a circle on the Argand diagram makes use of the fact 
that | z −z1| is the distance between the point z = x + jy and the point z1 = a + jb on the
diagram. Thus a circle of radius R and centre (a, b), illustrated in Figure 3.12, may be
written
| z −z1| = R
We can also write this as z −z1 = Rejt, where t is a parameter such that
−π  t  π
Example 3.26
Find the cartesian equation of the circle
| z −(2 + j3) | = 2
Solution
Now,
z −(2 + j3) = (x −2) + j(y −3)

continued
Figure 3.12
The circle | z −z1 | = R.

220
COMPLEX NUMBERS
so that
| z −(2 + j3) | = ÷[(x −2)2 + (y −3)2]
and hence on the circle
| z −(2 + j3) | = 2
we have
÷[(x −2)2 + (y −3)2] = 2
which implies
(x −2)2 + (y −3)2 = 4
indicating that the circle has centre (2, 3) and radius 2.
This may be written in the standard form
x2 + y2 −4x −6y + 9 = 0
This is not the only method of representing a circle, as is shown in the following two
examples.
Example 3.27
Find the cartesian equation of the curve whose equation on the Argand diagram is 
Solution
By expressing it in the form | z −j | = ÷2| z −(1 + j2) | we can interpret this equation as
‘the distance between z and j is ÷2 times the distance between z and (1 + j2)’, so this is
different from Example 3.25(d).
Putting z = x + jy into the equation gives
| x + j(y −1) | = ÷2 | (x −1) + j(y −2) |
Thus
÷[x2 + (y −1)2] = ÷2÷[(x −1)2 + (y −2)2]
which, on squaring both sides, implies
x2 + (y −1)2 = 2[(x −1)2 + (y −2)2]
Multiplying out the brackets and collecting terms we obtain
x2 + y2 −4x −6y + 9 = 0
or
(x −2)2 + (y −3)2 = 4
which, from (1.14), is the equation of the circle of centre (2, 3), and radius 2.
This is a special case of a general result. If z1 and z2 are ﬁxed complex numbers and 
k is a positive real number, then the locus of z which satisﬁes
is a circle, 
known as the circle of Apollonius, unless k = 1. When k = 1, the locus is a straight line,
as we saw in Example 3.25(d).

3.4 LOCI IN THE COMPLEX PLANE
221
Example 3.28
Find the locus of z in the Argand diagram such that
Re[(z −j)/(z + 1)] = 0
Solution
Setting z = x + jy, as usual, we obtain
Hence Re[(z −j)/(z + 1)] = 0 implies x(x + 1) + y(y −1) = 0.
Rearranging this, we have
x2 + y2 + x −y = 0
and
Hence the locus of z on the Argand diagram is a circle of centre 
and radius
÷2/2.
3.4.3
More general loci
In general we approach the problem of ﬁnding the locus of z on the Argand diagram
using a mixture of elementary pure geometry and algebraic manipulation of expressions
involving z = x + jy. We illustrate this in Example 3.29.
Example 3.29
Find the cartesian equation of the locus of z given by
| z + 1 | + | z −1 | = 4
Solution
The deﬁning equation here may be interpreted as the sum of the distances of the point z
from the points 1 and −1 is a constant (= 4). By elementary considerations (Figure 3.13)
we can see that the locus passes through (2, 0), (0, ÷3), (−2, 0) and (0, −÷3). Results
from classical geometry would identify the locus as an ellipse with foci at (1, 0) and 
(−1, 0), using the ‘string property’ (see Example 1.40). Using algebraic methods, 
however, we set z = x + jy into the equation, giving
÷[(x + 1)2 + y2] + ÷[(x −1)2 + y2] = 4

COMPLEX NUMBERS
Rewriting this equation as
÷[(x + 1)2 + y2] = 4 −÷[(x −1)2 + y2]
and squaring both sides gives
(x + 1)2 + y2 = 16 −8÷[(x −1)2 + y2] + (x −1)2 + y2
This simpliﬁes to give
4 −x = 2÷[(x −1)2 + y2]
so that squaring both sides again gives
16 −8x + x2 = 4[x2 −2x + 1 + y2]
which reduces to

3.5 FUNCTIONS OF A COMPLEX VARIABLE
223
3.5
Functions of a complex variable
In Section 2.2.1 the basic idea of a function was described. Essentially it involves two
sets X and Y and a rule that assigns to every element x in the set X precisely one ele-
ment y in the set Y. In Chapter 2 we were concerned with real functions so that x and 
y were real numbers. When the independent variable is a complex number z = x + jy
then, in general, a function f(z) of z will have values which are complex numbers.
Conventionally w = u + jv is used to denote the dependent variable of a function of a
complex variable, thus
w = u + jv = f(z)
where
z = x + jy
Example 3.30
Express u and v in terms of x and y where w = u + jv, z = x + jy, w = f(z) and
(a) f(z) = z2
(b) f(z) =
, z ≠−1
Solution
(a) When w = z2, we have u + jv = (x + jy)2. This may be rewritten as
u + jv = x 2 −y2 + j2xy
so that comparing real and imaginary parts on either side of this equation we have
u = x 2 −y2
and
v = 2xy
(b) When w =
, we have
Hence comparing real and imaginary parts we have
These may be written as
The graphical representation of functions of a complex variable requires two planes,
one for the independent variable z = x + jy and another for the dependent variable 
w = u + jv. Thus the function w = f(z) can be regarded as a mapping of points on the 
z plane to points on the w plane. Under such a mapping a region A on the z plane is
transformed into the region A′ on the w plane.

COMPLEX NUMBERS
Solution
The easiest approach to this problem is ﬁrstly to ﬁnd x in terms of u and v. So solving 
for z we have
and
Equating real parts then gives
The line x = 1 maps into
which simpliﬁes to give the circle on the w plane
(u −2)2 + v2 = 1
The line x = 2 maps into
which simpliﬁes to give the circle on the w plane
(u −

Thus the strip between x = 1 and x = 2 maps into that portion of the w plane between
these two circles, as illustrated in Figure 3.14. The point

ﬁrming that the shaded areas correspond.

Engineering application: alternating currents in
electrical networks
When an alternating current i = I sinωt (ω is a constant and t is the time) ﬂows in a 
circuit the corresponding voltage depends on ω and on the resistance, capacitance and
inductance of the circuit. (Note that the frequency of the current is ω/2π.) For sim-
plicity we shall separate these three elements and consider their effects individually.
For a resistor of resistance R the corresponding voltage is v = IR sinωt. This voltage
is ‘in phase’ with the current. It is zero at the same times as i and achieves its maxima
at the same times as i, as shown in Figure 3.15. For a capacitor of capacitance C
the corresponding voltage is v = (I/ωC)sin(ωt −
), as shown in Figure 3.16. Here

is the phase. The impedance | Z | clearly varies with ω, and the graph of this dependence
is shown in Figure 3.19. The minimum value occurs when Lω = 1/Cω; that is, when 
ω = 1/÷(LC). This implies that the circuit ‘blocks’ currents with low and high frequencies,

4.1
Introduction
Much of the work of engineers and scientists involves forces. Ensuring the structural
integrity of a building or a bridge involves knowing the forces acting on the system and
designing the structural members to withstand them. Many have seen the dramatic 
pictures of the Tacoma bridge disaster (see also Section 10.10.3), when the forces acting
on the bridge were not predicted accurately. To analyse such a system requires the use of
Newton’s laws in a situation where vector notation is essential. Similarly, in a reciprocat-
ing engine, periodic forces act, and Newton’s laws are used to design a crankshaft 
that will reduce the side forces to zero, thereby minimizing wear on the moving parts.
Forces are three-dimensional quantities and provide one of the commonest examples of
vectors. Associated with these forces are accelerations and velocities, which can also
be represented by vectors. The use of formal mathematical notation and rules becomes
progressively more important as problems become complicated and, in particular, in
three-dimensional situations. Forces, velocities and accelerations all satisfy rules of
addition that identify them as vectors. In this chapter we shall construct an algebraic
theory for the manipulation of vectors and see how it can be applied to some simple
practical problems.
The ideas behind vectors as formal quantities developed mainly during the nine-
teenth century, and they became a well-established tool in the twentieth century. Vectors
provide a convenient and compact way of dealing with multi-dimensional situations
without the problem of writing down every bit of information. They allow the principles
of the subject to be developed without being obscured by complicated notation.
It is inconceivable that modern scientists and engineers could work successfully
without computers. Since such machines cannot think like an engineer or scientist, they
have to be told in a totally precise and formal way what to do. For instance, a robot arm
needs to be given instructions on how to position itself to perform a spot weld. Three-
dimensional vectors prove to be the perfect way to tell the computer how to specify the
position of the workpiece of the robot arm and a set of rules then tells the robot how to
move to its working position.
Computers have put a great power at the disposal of the engineer; problems that
proved to be impossible ﬁfty years ago are now routine. With the aid of numerical algo-
rithms, equations can often be solved very quickly. The stressing of a large structure 
or an aircraft wing, the lubrication of shafts and bearings, the ﬂow of sewage in pipes
and the ﬂow past the fuselage of an aircraft are all examples of systems that were well
understood in principle but could not be analysed until the necessary computer power
became available. Algorithms are usually written in terms of vectors and matrices (see
Chapter 5), since these form a natural setting for the numerical solution of engineering
problems and are also ideal for the computer. It is vital that the manipulation of vectors
be understood before embarking on more complex mathematical structures used in
engineering computations.
Perhaps the most powerful inﬂuence of computers is in their graphical capabilities,
which have proved invaluable in displaying the static and dynamic behaviour of sys-
tems. We accept this tool without thinking how it works. A simple example shows the
complexity. How do we display a box with an open top with ‘hidden’ lines when we
look at it from a given angle? The problem is a complicated three-dimensional one that
must be analysed instantly by a computer. Vectors allow us to deﬁne lines that can be
projected onto the screen, and intersections can then be computed so that the ‘hidden’

portion can be eliminated. Extending the analysis to a less regular shape is a formidable
vector problem. Work of this type is the basis of CAD/CAM systems, which now assist
engineers in all stages of the manufacturing process, from design to production of a
ﬁnished product. Such systems typically allow engineers to manipulate the product
geometry during initial design, to produce working drawings, to generate toolpaths in
the production process and generally to automate a host of previously tedious and time-
consuming tasks.
The general development of the theory of vectors is closely associated with coordin-
ate geometry, so we shall introduce a few ideas in the next section that will be used later
in the chapter. The comments largely concern the two- and three-dimensional cases, but
we shall mention higher-dimensional extensions where they are relevant to later work,
such as on the theory of matrices. While in two and three dimensions we can appeal 
to geometrical intuition, it is necessary to work in a much more formal way in higher
dimensions, as with many other areas of mathematics.
4.2
Basic deﬁnitions and results
4.2.1
Cartesian coordinates
Setting up rectangular cartesian axes Oxyz or Ox1x2x3, we deﬁne the position of a point
by coordinates or components (x, y, z) or (x1, x2, x3), as indicated in Figure 4.1(a). The
indicial notation is particularly important when we consider vectors in many dimensions
(x1, x2, … , xn). The axes Ox, Oy, Oz, in that order, are assumed to be right-handed in
the sense of Figure 4.1(b), so that a rotation of a right-handed screw from Ox to Oy
advances it along Oz, a rotation from Oy to Oz advances it along Ox and a rotation from
Oz to Ox advances it along Oy. This is an accepted convention, and it will be seen to
be particularly important in Section 4.2.10 when we deal with the vector product.
The length of OP in Figure 4.1(a) is obtained from Pythagoras’ theorem as
r = (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2
The angle α = ∠POA in the right-angled triangle OAP is the angle that OP makes with
the positive x direction, as in Figure 4.2. We can see that
Figure 4.1
(a) Right-handed
coordinate axes. 
(b) Right-hand rule.

Likewise, β and γ are the angles that OP makes with y and z directions respectively, so
The triad (l, m, n) are called the direction cosines of the line OP. Note that
Example 4.1
If P has coordinates (2, −1, 3), ﬁnd the length OP and the direction cosines of OP.
Solution
OP2 = (2)2 + (−1)2 + (3)2 = 4 + 1 + 9,
so that OP = ÷14
The direction cosines are
l = 2÷
,
m = −÷
,
n = 3÷
Example 4.2
A surveyor sets up his theodolite on horizontal ground, at a point O, and observes the top
of a church spire, as illustrated in Figure 4.3. Relative to axes Oxyz, with Oz vertical,
the surveyor measures the angles ∠TOx = 66° and ∠TOz = 57°. The church is known
to have height 35m. Find the angle ∠TOy and calculate the coordinates of T with
respect to the given axes.
Solution
The direction cosines
l = cos 66° = 0.406 74
and
n = cos 57° = 0.544 64
are known and hence the third direction cosine can be computed as
m2 = 1 −l 2 −n2 = 0.53793
Thus, m = 0.73344 and hence ∠TOy = cos−1(0.73344) = 42.82°. The length OT = r can
now be computed from the known height, 35 m, and the direction cosine n, as

cos 57° = 35/r,
so
r = 64.26 m
The remaining coordinates are obtained from
x/r = cos 66°
and
y/r = cos 42.82°
giving x = r cos 66° = 26.14 and y = r cos 42.82° = 47.13
Hence the coordinates of T are (26.14, 47.13, 35).
4.2.2
Scalars and vectors
Quantities like distance or temperature are represented by real numbers in appropriate
units, for instance 5m or 10°C. Such quantities are called scalars – they obey the usual
rules of real numbers and they have no direction associated with them. However, 
vectors have both a magnitude and a direction associated with them; these include
force, velocity and magnetic ﬁeld. To qualify as vectors, the quantities must have more
than just magnitude and direction – they must also satisfy some particular rules of 
combination. Angular displacement in three dimensions gives an example of a quantity
which has a direction and magnitude but which does not add by the addition rules of
vectors, so angular displacements are not vectors.
We represent a vector geometrically by a line segment whose length represents the
vector’s magnitude in some appropriate units and whose direction represents the 
vector’s direction, with the arrowhead indicating the sense of the vector, as shown in
Figure 4.4. According to this deﬁnition, the starting point of the vector is irrelevant. In
Figure 4.4, the two line segments OA and O′A′ represent the same vector because their
lengths are the same, their directions are the same and the sense of the arrows is the
same. Thus each of these vectors is equivalent to the vector through the origin, with A
given by its coordinates (a1, a2, a3), as in Figure 4.5. We can therefore represent a 
vector in a three-dimensional space by an ordered set of three numbers or a 3-tuple. 
We shall see how this representation is used in Section 4.2.5.
We shall now introduce some of the basic notation and deﬁnitions for vectors. The
vector of Figure 4.5 is handwritten or typewritten as b, a, o1a2. On the printed page,
bold-face type a is used. Using the coordinate deﬁnition, the vector could equally be
written as (a1, a2, a3). (Note: There are several possible coordinate notations; the tradi-
tional one is (a1, a2, a3), but in Section 5.2.1 of Chapter 5 on matrices we shall use an
alternative standard notation.)
Figure 4.3

axes and church spire

Line segments

vector a.

Some basic properties of vectors are:
(a) Equality
As we considered earlier, two vectors a and b are equal if and only if they have the
same modulus and the same direction and sense. We write this in the usual way
a = b
We shall see in Section 4.2.5 that in component form, two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and 
b = (b1, b2, b3) are equal if and only if the components are equal, that is
a1 = b1,
a2 = b2,
a3 = b3
(b) Multiplication by a scalar
If λ is a scalar and the vectors are related by a = λb then
•
if λ  0,
a is a vector in the same direction as b with magnitude λ times the
magnitude of b;
•
if λ  0,
a is a vector in the opposite direction to b with magnitude | λ| times
the magnitude of b.
(c) Parallel Vectors
The vectors a and b in (b) are said to be parallel or antiparallel according as λ  0 or 
λ  0 respectively. (Note that we do not insert any multiplication symbol between λ
and b since the common symbols · and × are reserved for special uses that we shall 
discuss later.)
(d) Modulus
The modulus or length or magnitude of a vector a is written as |a | or | o1a2 | or a if
there is no ambiguity. A vector with modulus one is called a unit vector and is written
â, with the hat (ˆ) indicating a unit vector. Clearly
a = | a |â
or
(e) Zero Vector
The zero or null vector has zero modulus; it is written as 0 or often just as 0 when there
is no ambiguity whether it is a vector or not.

Example 4.3
A cyclist travels at a steady 16 km/h on the four legs of his journey. From his origin,
O, he travels for one hour in a NE direction to the point A; he then travels due E for
half an hour to point B. He then cycles in a NW direction until he reaches the point C,
which is due N of his starting point. He returns due S to the starting point. Indicate the
path of the cyclist using vectors and calculate the modulus of the vectors along BC 
and CO.
Solution
The four vectors are shown in Figure 4.6. If / and - are the unit vectors along the two
axes then by property (b)
a1b2 = 8/
and
c1o2 = −L-
where L is still to be determined. By trigonometry
DB = 8 + 16 sin 45° = 8 + 8÷2
and hence the modulus of the vector b1c2 is
| BC | =
= 8÷2 + 16
The modulus L of the vector c1o2 is
L = | c1o2 | = CD + DO = (8 + 8÷2) + 16 cos 45° = 8 + 16÷2

4.2.3
Addition of vectors
Having introduced vectors and their basic properties, it is natural to ask if vectors can be
combined. The simplest form of vector combination is addition and it is the deﬁnition of
addition that ﬁnally identiﬁes a vector. Consider the following situation. The helmsman
of a small motor boat steers his vessel due east (E) at 4 knots for one hour. The path
taken by the boat could be represented by the line OA, or a, in Figure 4.7. Unfortunately
there is also a tidal stream, b, running north-north-east (NNE) at
knots. Where will
the boat actually be at the end of one hour?
If we imagine the vessel to be steaming E for one hour through still water, and then
lying still in the water and drifting with the tidal stream for one hour, we can see that it
will travel from O to A in the ﬁrst hour and from A to C in the second hour. If, on the
2 1
2

other hand, the vessel steams due E through water that is simultaneously moving 
NNE with the tidal stream then the result will be to arrive at C after one hour. The net
velocity of the boat is represented by the line OC. Putting this another way, the result of
subjecting the boat to a velocity o1a2 and a velocity a1c2 simultaneously is the same 
as the result of subjecting it to a velocity o1c2. Thus the velocity o1c2 = a + b is the sum
of the velocity o1a2 = a and the velocity a1c22 = b.
This leads us to the parallelogram rule for vector addition illustrated in Figure 4.8
and stated as follows:
The sum, or resultant, of two vectors a and b is found by forming a paral-
lelogram with a and b as two adjacent sides. The sum a + b is the vector
represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram.
In Figure 4.8 the vectors o1b2 and a1c2 are the same, so we can rewrite the parallelo-
gram rule as an equivalent triangle law (Figure 4.9), which can be stated as follows:
If two vectors a and b are represented in magnitude and direction by the
two sides of a triangle taken in order then their sum is represented in 
magnitude and direction by the closing third side.
The triangle law for the addition of vectors can be extended to the addition of any 
number of vectors. If from a point O (Figure 4.10), displacements o1a2, a1b2, b1c2, … , l1k2
are drawn along the adjacent sides of a polygon to represent in magnitude and direction
the vectors a, b, c, … , k respectively then the sum
r = a + b + c + … + k
of these vectors is represented in magnitude and direction by the closing side OK of the
polygon, the sense of the sum vector being represented by the arrow in Figure 4.10.
This is referred to as the polygon law for the addition of vectors.
We now need to look at the usual rules of algebra for scalar quantities to check
whether or not they are satisﬁed for vectors.
(a) CommutatiVe law
a + b = b + a
This result is obvious from the geometrical deﬁnition, and says that order does not 
matter.

(b) AssociatiVe law

Geometrically, the result can be deduced using the triangle and polygon laws, as shown
in Figure 4.11. We see that brackets do not matter and can be omitted.
(d) Subtraction
We deﬁne subtraction in the obvious way:
a −b = a + (−b)
This is illustrated geometrically in Figure 4.13. Applying the triangle rule to triangle
OAB gives
b1a2 = b1o2 + o1a2 = o1a2 + b1o2
= o1a2 −o1b2
since
b1o2 = −o1b2
(c) DistributiVe law
λ(a + b) = λa + λb
The result follows from similar triangles. In Figure 4.12 the side O′B′ is just λ times
OB in length and in the same direction, so o1′1b1′2 = λ(a + b). The triangle law therefore
gives the required result since o1′1b1′2 = o1′1a1′2 + a1′1b1′2 = λa + λb. This result just says that
we can multiply brackets out by the usual laws of algebra.

from which the important result is obtained, namely
b1a2 = o1a2 −o1b2

Solution
From the triangle OAB: a1b2 = a1o2 + o1b2 and hence g = a + b
From the triangle OBC: c1b2 = o1b2 −o1c2 and hence f = b −c
From the triangle OCD: c1d2 = o1d2 −o1c2 and hence e = d −c
From the quadrilateral CBAD the polygon rule gives
c1d2 + d1a2 + a1b2 + b1c2 = 0 and hence e + (−h) + g + (−f ) = 0 so e = f −g + h

Solution
The resultant velocity of the plane is the vector sum of 50knots from the NW direction
and 400knots in a direction α° north of west. In appropriate units the situation is shown
in Figure 4.16(a). The vector o1a2 represents the wind velocity and o1b2 represents the
aeroplane velocity. The resultant velocity is o1p2, which is required to be due W. We

If ABCD is any quadrilateral, show that a1d2 + b1c2 = 2e1f2, where E and F are the 
midpoints of AB and DC respectively, and that
a1b2 + a1d2 + c1b2 + c1d2 = 4x1y2
where X and Y are the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD respectively.
Solution
Applying the polygon law for the addition of vectors to Figure 4.17,
e1f2 = e1a2 + a1d2 + d1f2
and
e1f2 = e1b2 + b1c2 + c1f2
Adding these two then gives
2e1f2 = e1a2 + a1d2 + d1f2 + e1b2 + b1c2 + c1f2
= a1d2 + b1c2 + ( b1a2 +
c1d2 −

since E and F are the midpoints of AB and CD respectively. Thus
2e1f2 = a1d2 + b1c2

and

= 2a1b2 + 2c1b2 + 4b1y2
(since x1a2 = −x1c2)
= 2a1b2 + 2c1b2 + 2b1d2
(since b1d2 = 2b1y2)
= a1b2 + c1b2 + (a1b2 + b1d2) + (c1b2 + b1d2)
so that
4x1y2 = a1b2 + c1b2 + a1d2 + c1d2

Cartesian components and basic properties
In Section 4.2.2 we saw that vectors could be written as an ordered set of three numbers
or 3-tuple. We shall now explore the properties of these ordered triples and how they
relate to the geometrical deﬁnitions used in previous sections.
In Figure 4.19, we denote mutually perpendicular unit vectors in the three coordinate
directions by i, j and k. (Sometimes the alternative notation ê1, ê2 and ê3 is used.) 
The notation i, j, k is so standard that the ‘hats’ indicating unit vectors are usually 
omitted.
244
VECTOR ALGEBRA
Figure 4.19
The component form
of a vector.
Applying the triangle law to the triangle OXM, we have
o1m2 = o1x2 + X111M2 = xi + yj
Applying the triangle law to the triangle OMP then yields
o1p2 = o1m2 + m1p2 = xi + yj + zk
(4.1)
The analysis applies to any point, so we can write any vector r in terms of its 
components x, y, z with respect to the unit vectors i, j, k as
r = xi + yj + zk
Indeed, the vector notation r = (x, y, z) should be intepreted as the vector given in (4.1).
In some contexts it is more convenient to use a sufﬁx notation for the coordinates, and
(x1, x2, x3) = x1ê1 + x2ê2 + x3ê3
is interpreted in exactly the same way. It is assumed that the three basic unit vectors are
known, and all vectors in coordinate form are referred to them.
The modulus of a vector is just the length OP, so from Figure 4.19 we have, using
Pythagoras’ theorem,
| r | = (x 2 + y 2 + z 2 )1/2
The basic properties of vectors follow easily from the component deﬁnition in (4.1). 

4.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS
245
(a) Equality
Two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3) are equal if and only if the three 
components are equal, that is
a1 = b1,
a2 = b2,
a3 = b3
(b) Zero Vector
The zero vector has zero components, so
0 = (0, 0, 0)
(c) Addition
The addition rule is expressed very simply in terms of vector components:
a + b = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3)
The equivalence of this deﬁnition with the geometrical deﬁnition for addition using the
parallelogram rule can be deduced from Figure 4.20. We know that o1b2 = a1c2, since
they are equivalent displacements, and hence their x components are the same, so that
we have OL = MN. Thus if we take the x component of a + b
(a + b)1 = ON = OM + MN = OM + OL = a1 + b1
the y and z components can be considered in a similar manner, giving (a + b)2 = a2 + b2
and (a + b)3 = a3 + b3.
Figure 4.20
Parallelogram rule, x
component.
(d) Multiplication by a scalar
If λ is a scalar and the vectors are related by a = λb then the components satisfy
a1 = λb1,
a2 = λb2,
a3 = λb3
which follows from the similar triangles of Figure 4.12.
(e) DistributiVe law
The distributive law in components is simply a restatement of the distributive law for
the addition of numbers:

λ(a + b) = λ(a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3)
= (λ(a1 + b1), λ(a2 + b2), λ(a3 + b3))
= (λa1 + λb1, λa2 + λb2, λa3 + λb3)
= (λa1, λa2, λa3) + (λb1, λb2, λb3)
= λa + λb
(f) Subtraction
Subtraction is again straightforward and the components are just subtracted from 
each other:
a −b = (a1 −b1, a2 −b2, a3 −b3)
The component form of vectors allows problems to be solved algebraically and
results can be interpreted either as algebraic ideas or in a geometrical manner. Both
these interpretations can be very useful in applications of vectors to engineering.
In MATLAB a vector is inserted as an array within square brackets, so, for 
example, a vector a = (1, 2, 3) is inserted as a = [1 2 3] or a = [1,2,3], where
in the latter commas have been used instead of spaces. It is inserted as
a:= array([1,2,3]); in MAPLE, where it is usually necessary to invoke the
linalg package ﬁrst. The operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication by 
a scalar are represented by +, - and * respectively, but to evaluate the operations
numerically requires the instruction evalm. The magnitude or length of a vector 
a appears in MATLAB as norm(a) and in MAPLE as norm(a,2).
Example 4.9
Determine whether constants α and β can be found to satisfy the vector equations
(a) (2, 1, 0) = α(−2, 0, 2) + β(1, 1, 1)
(b) (−3, 1, 2) = α(−2, 0, 2) + β(1, 1, 1)
and interpret the results.
Solution
(a) For the two vectors to be the same each of the components must be equal, and
hence
2 = −2α + β
1 = β
0 = 2α + β
Thus the second equation gives β = 1 and both of the other two equations give the same
value of α, namely α = −
, so the equations can be satisﬁed.
(b) A similar argument gives
−3 = −2α + β
1 = β
2 = 2α + β

Again, the second equation gives β = 1 but the ﬁrst equation leads to α = 2 and the third
to α =
. The equations are now not consistent and no appropriate α and β can be
found.
In case (a) the three vectors lie in a plane, and any vector in a plane, including the one
given, can be written as the vector sum of the two vectors (−2, 0, 2) and (1, 1, 1) with
appropriate multipliers. In case (b), however, the vector (−3, 1, 2) does not lie in the
plane of the two vectors (−2, 0, 2) and (1, 1, 1) and can, therefore, never be written as
the vector sum of the two vectors (−2, 0, 2) and (1, 1, 1) with appropriate multipliers.

(b) 2a −b = (2 × 1 −(−1), 2 × 1 − 2, 2 × 1 −3) = (3, 0, −1)
(c) a + b −c = (1 −1 + 0, 1 + 2 −3, 1 + 3 −4) = (0, 0, 0) = 0
(d) | c | = (32 + 42)1/2 = 5, so
Example 4.11
Given a = (2, −3, 1) = 2i −3j + k, b = (1, 5, −2) = i + 5j −2k and c = (3, −4, 3) = 3i −

(a) ﬁnd the vector d = a −2b + 3c;
(b) ﬁnd the magnitude of d and write down a unit vector in the direction of d;

= (2i −3j + k) −(2i + 10j −4k) + (9i −12j + 9k)
= (2 −2 + 9)i + (−3 −10 −12)j + (1 + 4 + 9)k
that is, d = 9i −25j + 14k.

0, −2 + ÷6) and those of the three Y atoms are

(a) Show that all of the bond lengths are equal.
(b) Show that x1y2 + y1y1′2 + y1′1y1″2 + y1″1x2 = 0
Solution
(a) x1y2 = o1y2 −o1x2 = (−÷3 −÷2, −2, 1 −÷6) and the bond length is 
| x1y2 | = [(−÷3 −÷2)2 + (−2)2 + (1 −÷6)2]1/2 = 4
y1y1′2 = o1y1′2 −o1y2 = (0, 4, 0) and clearly the bond length is again 4.
The other four bonds x1y1′2, x1y1″2, y1′1y1″2, y1″1y2 are treated in exactly the same way, and
each gives a bond length of 4.
(b) Now y1′1y1″2 = o1y1″2 −o1y1′2 = (÷2 −÷3, −2, ÷6 + 1) and y1″1x2 = o1x2 −o1y1″2
= (2÷3, 0, −2), so adding the four vectors gives
x1y2 + y1y1′2 + y1′1y1″2 + y1″1x2
= (−÷3 −÷2, −2, 1 −÷6) + (0, 4, 0) + (÷2 −÷3, −2, ÷6 + 1) + (2÷3, 0, −2)
= 0
and is just a veriﬁcation of the polygon law.

F3 has magnitude 10 and acts in the direction (3, −4, 0)
act on a particle. Find the resultant force that acts on the particle. What additional force
must be imposed on the particle to reduce the resultant force to zero?
Solution
The ﬁrst force is given in the usual vector form. The second two are given in an equally
acceptable way but it is necessary to convert the information to the normal vector form
so that the resultant can be found by vector addition. First the unit vector in the given
direction of F2 is required:
| (1, 2, −2)| = (1 + 22 + (−2)2)1/2 = 3
and hence the unit vector in this direction is
(1, 2, −2). Since F2 is in the direction of
this unit vector and has magnitude 6 it can be written F2 = 6( ,
, −
) = (2, 4, −4)
Similarly for F3, the unit vector is
(3, −4, 0) and hence F3 = (6, −8, 0). The resultant
force is obtained by vector addition.
F = F1 + F2 + F3 = (1, 1, 1) + (2, 4, −4) + (6, −8, 0) = (9, −3, −3)
Clearly to make the resultant force zero, the additional force (−9, 3, 3) must be imposed
on the particle.
Example 4.14
Two geostationary satellites have known positions (0, 0, h) and (0, A, H) relative to a
ﬁxed set of axes on the earth’s surface (which is assumed ﬂat, with the x and y axes
lying on the surface and the z axis vertical). Radar signals measure the distance of a ship
from the satellites. Find the position of the ship relative to the given axes.
Solution
Figure 4.21 illustrates the situation described, with R (a, b, 0) describing the position
of the ship and P and Q the positions of the satellites.
The radar signals measure PR and QR which are denoted by p and q respectively.
The vectors
p1r2 = o1r2 −o1p2 = (a, b, 0) −(0, 0, h) = (a, b, −h)

are calculated by the triangle law. The lengths of the two vectors are
p2 = |p1r2|2 = a2 + b2 + h2
and
q2 = |q1r2|2 = a2 + (b −A)2 + H 2
Subtracting gives
p2 −q2 = A(2b −A) + h2 −H 2
and hence
b = (p2 −q2 −h2 + H 2 + A2)/2A
Having calculated b then a can be calculated from
a = ±÷(p2 −b2 −h2)
Note the ambiguity in sign; clearly it will need to be known on which side of the y axis
the ship is lying.
Comment
In practice the axes will need to be transformed to standard latitude and longitude and
the curvature of the earth will need to be taken into consideration.

Complex numbers as vectors
We saw in Section 3.2.1, that a complex number z = x + jy can be represented geome-
trically by the point P in the Argand diagram, as illustrated in Figure 4.22. We could
equally well represent the point P by the vector o1p2. Hence we can express the complex
number z as a two-dimensional vector
z = o1p2
With this interpretation of a complex number we can use the parallelogram rule to 
represent the addition and subtraction of complex numbers geometrically, as illustrated
in Figures 4.23(a, b).

Example 4.15
A square is formed in the ﬁrst and second quadrant with OP as one side of the square
and o1p2 = (1, 2). Find the coordinates of the other two vertices of the square.
Solution
The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.24. Using the complex form o1p2 = 1 + 2j the side
OQ is obtained by rotating OP through π/2 radians, then
o1q2 = j(1 + 2j) = −2 + j
The fourth point R is found by observing that o1r2 is the vector sum of o1p2 and o1q2, and
hence
o1r2 = o1p2 + o1q2 = −1 + j3
The four coordinates are therefore
(0, 0), (1, 2), (−2, 1) and (−1, 3)

Applying the triangle law for addition of vectors of Figure 4.25 gives
m1a2 = m1o2 + o1a2
= o1a2 −o1m2
≡(1 + j5) −(−2 + j)
= 3 + j4
Since ABCD is a square,
MA = MB = MC = MD
∠AMB = ∠BMC = ∠CMD = ∠DMA =
π
Remembering that multiplying a complex number by j rotates it through
π radians in
an anticlockwise direction, we have
m1b2 = jm1a2 ≡j(3 + j4) = −4 + j3
giving
o1b2 = o1m2 + m1b2 ≡(−2 + j) + (−4 + j3) = −6 + j4
Likewise
m1c2 = jm1b2 ≡j(−4 + j3) = −3 −j4
giving
o1c2 = o1m2 + m1c2 ≡−5 −j3

and

4.2.8
The scalar product
A natural idea in mathematics, explored in Chapter 1, is not only to add quantities but
also to multiply them together. The concept of multiplication of vectors translates into
a useful tool for many engineering applications, with two different products of vectors
– the ‘scalar’ and ‘vector’ products – turning out to be particularly important.
The determination of a component of a vector is a basic procedure in analysing many
physical problems. For the vector a shown in Figure 4.28 the component of a in the
direction of OP is just ON = | a | cosθ. The component is relevant in the physical con-
text of work done by a force. Suppose the point of application, O, of a constant force F
is moved along the vector a from O to the point A, as in Figure 4.29. The component
of F in the a direction is | F | cosθ, and O is moved a distance | a |. The work done is
deﬁned as the product of the distance moved by the point of application and the com-
ponent of the force in this direction. It is thus given by
work done = | F| | a |cos θ
Figure 4.28
The component of a
in the direction OP is
ON = | a |cosθ.

The deﬁnition of the scalar product in geometrical terms takes the form of this
expression for the work done by a force. Again there is an equivalent component
deﬁnition, and both are now presented.
Deﬁnition
The scalar (or dot or inner) product of two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3)
is deﬁned as follows:
In components
a · b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3
(4.2a)
Geometrically
a · b = | a | | b | cosθ,
where θ (0  θ  π) is the angle between the two vectors
Both deﬁnitions prove to be useful in different contexts, but to establish the basic rules
the component deﬁnition is the simpler. The equivalence of the two deﬁnitions can 
easily be established from the cosine rule for a triangle. Using Figure 4.30 the cosine
rule (2.16) states
AB2 = OA2 + OB2 −2(OA)(OB) cosθ
which in appropriate vector or component notation gives
(a1 −b1)2 + (a2 −b2)2 + (a3 −b3)2 =
−2| a | | b | cosθ
Thus expanding the left-hand side gives
=
−2 | a | | b | cosθ
and hence
a · b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3 = | a | | b | cosθ
(4.2b)
Two important points to note are: (i) the scalar product of two vectors gives a number.
(ii) the scalar product is only deﬁned as the product of two vectors and not between any
other two quantities. For this reason, the presence of the dot (·) in a · b is essential
between the two vectors.

of the scalar product.

4.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS
255
This rule follows immediately from the component deﬁnition (4.2a), since interchanging
ai and bi does not make any difference to the products. The rule says that ‘order does 
not matter’.
(b) AssociatiVe law
The idea of associativity involves the product of three vectors. Since a · b is a scalar, it
cannot be dotted with a third vector, so the idea of associativity is not applicable here
and a · b · c is not deﬁned.
(c) DistributiVe law for products with a scalar λ
a · (λb) = (λa)·b = λ(a · b)
These results follow directly from the component deﬁnition (4.2a). The implication is
that scalars can be multiplied out in the normal manner.
(d) DistributiVe law oVer addition
a · (b + c) = a · b + a· c
The proof is straightforward, since
a · (b + c) = a1(b1 + c1) + a2(b2 + c2) + a3(b3 + c3)
= (a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3) + (a1c1 + a2c2 + a3c3)
= a · b + a· c
Thus the normal rules of algebra apply, and brackets can be multiplied out in the 
usual way.
(e) Powers of a
One simple point to note is that
a · a =
= | a | | a | cos0 = | a |2
in agreement with Section 4.2.5. This expression is written a2 = a · a and, where there
is no ambiguity, a2 = a2 is also used. No other powers of vectors can be constructed,
since, as in (b) above, scalar products of more than two vectors do not exist. For the
standard unit vectors, i, j and k,
i2 = i · i = 1,
j 2 = j· j = 1,
k2 = k · k = 1
(4.3)
(f) Perpendicular Vectors
It is clear from (4.2b) that if a and b are perpendicular (orthogonal) then cos θ =
cos
= 0, and hence a · b = 0, or in component notation
a · b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3 = 0

VECTOR ALGEBRA
However, the other way round, a · b = 0, does not imply that a and b are perpendicular.
There are three possibilities:
either a = 0
or
b = 0
or
θ =
It is only when the ﬁrst two possibilities have been dismissed that perpendicularity can
be deduced.
The commonest mistake is to deduce from
a · b = a · c
that b = c. This is only one of three possible solutions – the other two being a = 0 and
a perpendicular to b −c. The rule to follow is that you can’t cancel vectors in the same
way as scalars.
Since the unit vectors i, j and k are mutually perpendicular,
i · j = j · k = k · i = 0
(4.4)
Using the distributive law over addition, we obtain using (4.3) and (4.4)
(a1, a2, a3)·(b1, b2, b3) = (a1i + a2 j + a3k)·(b1i + b2 j + b3k)
= a1b1i · i + a1b2i · j + a1b3i · k + a2b1 j · i + a2b2 j · j
+ a2b3 j · k + a3b1k · i + a3b2k · j + a3b3k · k
= a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3
which is consistent with the component deﬁnition of a scalar product.
Perpendicularity is a very important idea, which is used a great deal in both math-
ematics and engineering. Pressure acts on a surface in a direction perpendicular to the 
surface, so that the force per unit area is given by pT, where p is the pressure and T is
the unit normal. To perform many calculations, we must be able to ﬁnd a vector that is
perpendicular to another vector. We shall also see that many matrix methods rely on
being able to construct a set of mutually orthogonal vectors. Such constructions are not
only of theoretical interest, but form the basis of many practical numerical methods used
in engineering (see Chapter 6 of the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics). The whole of the study of Fourier series (considered in Chapter 12),
which is central to much of signal processing and is heavily used by electrical 
engineers, is based on constructing functions that are orthogonal.
In MATLAB the scalar product of two vectors a and b is given by the command
dot(a,b). In MAPLE it is given by innerprod(a,b).

Given the vectors a = (1, −1, 2), b = (−2, 0, 2) and c = (3, 2, 1), evaluate

(b) b · c = (−2 × 3) + (0 × 2) + (2 × 1) = −4
(c) (a + b) = (1, −1, 2) + (−2, 0, 2) = (−1, −1, 4) so that 
(a + b)·c = (−1, −1, 4) · (3, 2, 1) = −3 −2 + 4 = −1
(note that (a + b)·c = a · c + b · c)
(d) a · (2b + 3c) = (1, −1, 2)· [(−4, 0, 4) + (9, 6, 3)]

(note that 2(a · b) + 3(a · c) = 4 + 9 = 13)
(e) (a · b)c = [(1, −1, 2)· (−2, 0, 2)](3, 2, 1) = [−2 + 0 + 4](3, 2, 1)
= 2(3, 2, 1) = (6, 4, 2)
(note that a · b is a scalar, so (a· b)c is a vector parallel or antiparallel to c)
Check that in MATLAB the commands
a = [1 –1 2]; b = [–2 0 2]; c = [3 2 1];
dot(a,c), dot(b,c), dot(a + b,c), dot(a,2*b + 3*c),
dot(a,b)*c
return the answers given in this example.
Example 4.18
Find the angle between the vectors a = (1, 2, 3) and b = (2, 0, 4).
Solution
By deﬁnition
a · b = | a | | b | cosθ = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3
We have in the right-hand side
(1, 2, 3) · (2, 0, 4) = 2 + 0 + 12 = 14
Also
| (1, 2, 3) | = ÷(12 + 22 + 32) = ÷14
and
| (2, 0, 4) | = ÷(22 + 02 + 42) = ÷20
Thus, from the deﬁnition of the scalar product,
14 = ÷(14)÷(20) cosθ
giving
θ = cos−1÷

Example 4.19
Given a = (1, 0, 1) and b = (0, 1, 0), show that a · b = 0, and interpret this result.
Solution
a · b = (1, 0, 1)· (0, 1, 0) = 0
Since | a | ≠0 and |b | ≠0, the two vectors are perpendicular. We can see this result 
geometrically, since a lies in the x–z plane and b is parallel to the y axis.
Example 4.20
The three vectors
a = (1, 1, 1),
b = (3, 2, −3)
and
c = (−1, 4, −1)
are given. Show that a · b = a ·c and interpret the result.
Solution
Now
a · b = 1 × 3 + 1 × 2 −1 × 3 = 2
and
a · c = 1 × (−1) + 1 × 4 + 1 × (−1) = 2
so the two scalar products are clearly equal. Certainly b ≠c since they are given to be
unequal and a is non-zero, so the conclusion from
a · (b −c) = 0
is that the vectors a and (b −c) = (4, −2, −2) are perpendicular.
Example 4.21
In a triangle ABC show that the perpendiculars from the vertices to the opposite sides
intersect in a point.
Solution
Let the perpendiculars AD and BE meet in O, as indicated in Figure 4.31, and choose
O to be the origin. Deﬁne o1a2 = a, o1b2 = b and o1c2 = c. Then
AD perpendicular to BC implies a · (b −c) = 0
BE perpendicular to AC implies b · (c −a) = 0
Hence, adding,
a · b −a · c + b · c −b · a = 0
so
b · c −a · c = c· (b −a) = 0
This statement implies that b −a is perpendicular to c or AB is perpendicular to CF, 
as required. The case b −a = 0 is dismissed, since then the triangle would collapse. 
The case c = 0 implies that C is at O; the triangle is then right-angled and the result is
trivial.
Example 4.22

point Q having position vectors (1, 4, −1) and (−2, 3, 1) respectively.

4.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS

Solution
Applying the triangle law to Figure 4.32, we have the displacement of the particle 
given by
r = p1q2 = p1o2 + o1q2 = o1q2 −o1p2
= (−2, 3, 1) −(1, 4, −1) = (−3, −1, 2)
Then the work done by the force F is
F · r = (3, −2, 5)· (−3, −1, 2) = −9 + 2 + 10
= 3 units
The component of a vector in a given direction was discussed at the start of this sec-
tion, and, as indicated in Figure 4.28, the component of F in the a direction is |F|cos θ.
Taking â to be the unit vector in the a direction,
F · â = | F | | â | cosθ = | F | cosθ
= the component of F in the a direction
Example 4.23
Find the component of the vector F = (2, −1, 3) in
(a) the i direction
(b) the direction
(c) the direction (4, 2, −1)
Solution
(a) The direction i is represented by the vector (1, 0, 0), so the component of F in the
i direction is
F ·(1, 0, 0) = (2, −1, 3) · (1, 0, 0) = 2
(note how this result just picks out the x component and agrees with the usual idea of a
component).
(b) Since ÷
= 1, the vector 
is a unit vector. Thus the component 
of F in the direction 
is 
F ·
(c) Since ÷(16 + 4 + 1) ≠1, the vector (4, 2, −1) is not a unit vector. Therefore we must
ﬁrst compute its magnitude as
÷(42 + 22 + 12) = ÷21
indicating that a unit vector in the direction of (4, 2, −1) is (4, 2, −1)/÷21. Thus the 
component of F in the direction of (4, 2, −1) is
F · (4, 2, −1)/÷21 = 3/÷21

4.2.10
The vector product
The vector or cross product was developed during the nineteenth century, its main
practical use being to deﬁne the moment of a force in three dimensions. It is generally only
in three dimensions that the vector product is used. The adaptation for two-dimensional
vectors is of restricted scope, since for two-dimensional problems, where all vectors are
conﬁned to a plane, the direction of the vector product is always perpendicular to that
plane.
Deﬁnition
Given two vectors a and b, we deﬁne the vector product geometrically as
a × b = | a | | b | sinθ T
(4.5)
where θ is the angle between a and b (0  θ  π), and T is the unit vector perpendicu-
lar to both a and b such that a, b, T form a right-handed set – see Figure 4.34 and the
deﬁnition at the beginning of Section 4.2.1.

It is important to recognize that the vector product of two vectors is itself a vector.
The alternative notation a ∧b is also sometimes used to denote the vector product, but
this is less common since the similar wedge symbol ∧is also used for other purposes
(see e.g. Section 6.4.2).
There are wide-ranging applications of the vector product.
Motion of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld
l
If a charged particle has velocity v and moves in a magnetic ﬁeld H then the 
particle experiences a force perpendicular to both v and H, which is proportional
to v × H. It is this force that is used to direct the beam in a television tube. 
l
Similarly a wire moving with velocity v in a magnetic ﬁeld H produces a cur-
rent proportional to v × H (see Figure 4.35), thus converting mechanical energy
into electric current, and provides the principle of the dynamo.
l
For an electric motor the idea depends on the observation that an electric 
current C in a wire that lies in a magnetic ﬁeld H produces a mechanical force
proportional to C × H; again see Figure 4.35. Thus electrical energy is converted
to a mechanical force.

262
VECTOR ALGEBRA
Moment of a force
The moment or torque of a force F provides the classical application of the vector prod-
uct in a mechanical context. Although moments are easy to deﬁne in two dimensions,
the extension to three dimensions is not so easy. In vector notation, however, if the
force passes through the point P and o1p2 = r, as illustrated in Figure 4.36, then the
moment M of the force about O is simply deﬁned as
M = r × F = | r | | F| sinθ T = OQ | F | T
(4.6)
This is a vector in the direction of the normal T, and moments add by the usual paral-
lelogram law.
Angular velocity of a rigid body
A further application of the vector product relates to rotating bodies. Consider a 
rigid body rotating with angular speed ω (in rads−1) about a ﬁxed axis LM that passes
through a ﬁxed point O, as illustrated in Figure 4.37. A point P of the rigid body having
position vector r relative to O will move in a circular path whose plane is perpendicular
to OM and whose centre N is on OM. If NQ is a ﬁxed direction and the angle QNP is
equal to χ then
the magnitude of angular velocity =

4.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS
263
(Note that we have used here the idea of a derivative, which will be introduced in
Chapter 8.) The velocity v of P will be in the direction of the tangent shown and will
have magnitude
If we deﬁne ω to be a vector of magnitude ω and having direction along the axis of
rotation, in the sense in which the rotation would drive a right-handed screw, then
v = ω × r
(4.7)
correctly deﬁnes the velocity of P in both magnitude and direction. This vector ω is
called the angular velocity of the rigid body.
Area of parallelogram and a triangle
Geometrically we have from Figure 4.38 that the area of a parallelogram ABCD is
given by
area = h| a1b2| = | a1d2 | sinθ| a1b2| = | a1d2 × a1b2|
Note also that the area of the triangle ABD is 
| a1d2 × a1b2|, which corresponds to 
the result
area of triangle ABD =
(AD)(AB)sinθ
We now examine the properties of vector products in order to determine whether or
not the usual laws of algebra apply.
Basic properties
(a) Anti-commutatiVe law
a × b = −(b × a)
This follows directly from the right-handedness of the set in the geometrical deﬁnition
(4.5), since T changes direction when the order of multiplication is reversed. Thus the
vector product does not commute, but rather anti-commutes, unlike the multiplication
of scalars or the scalar product of two vectors. Therefore the order of multiplication

matters when using the vector product. For example, it is important that the moment of
a force is calculated as M = r × F and not F × r.
(b) Non-associatiVe multiplication
Since the vector product of two vectors is a vector, we can take the vector product with
a third vector, and associativity can be tested. It turns out to fail in general, and
a × (b × c) ≠(a × b) × c
except in special cases, such as when a = 0. This can be seen to be the case from geo-
metrical considerations using the deﬁnition (4.5). The vector b × c is perpendicular to
both b and c, and is thus perpendicular to the plane containing b and c. Also, by
deﬁnition, a × (b × c) is perpendicular to b × c, and is therefore in the plane of b and c.
Similarly, (a × b) × c is in the plane of a and b. Hence, in general, a × (b × c) and 
(a × b) × c are different vectors.
Since the associative law does not hold in general, we never write a × b × c, since 
it is ambiguous. Care must be taken to maintain the correct order and thus brackets must
be inserted when more than two vectors are involved in a vector product.
(c) DistributiVe law oVer multiplication by a scalar
The deﬁnition (4.5) shows trivially that
a × (λb) = λ(a × b) = (λa) × b
and the usual algebraic rule applies.
(d) DistributiVe law oVer addition
a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)
This law holds for the vector product. It can be proved geometrically using the deﬁ-
nition (4.5). The proof, however, is rather protracted and is omitted here.
(e) Parallel Vectors
It is obvious from the deﬁnition (4.5) that if a and b are parallel or antiparallel then 
θ = 0 or π, so that a × b = 0, and this includes the case a × a = 0. We note, however,
that if a × b = 0 then we have three possible cases: either a = 0 or b = 0 or a and b are
parallel. As with the scalar product, if we have a × b = a × c then we cannot deduce that
b = c. We ﬁrst have to show that a ≠0 and that a is not parallel to b −c.
(f) Cartesian form
From the deﬁnition (4.5), it clearly follows that the three unit vectors, i, j and k parallel
to the coordinate axes satisfy
i × i = j × j = k × k = 0
i × j = k,
j × k = i,
k × i = j
(4.8)

Note the cyclic order of these latter equations. Using these results, we can obtain the
cartesian or component form of the vector product. Taking
a = (a1, a2, a3) = a1i + a2 j + a3k
and
b = (b1, b2, b3) = b1i + b2 j + b3k
then, using rules (c), (d) and (a),
a × b = (a1i + a2 j + a3k) × (b1i + b2 j + b3k)
= a1b1(i × i) + a1b2(i × j) + a1b3(i × k) + a2b1( j × i) + a2b2( j × j) 
+ a2b3( j × k) + a3b1(k × i) + a3b2(k × j) + a3b3(k × k)
= a1b2k + a1b3(−j) + a2b1(−k) + a2b3i + a3b1 j + a3b2(−i)
so that
a × b = (a2b3 −a3b2)i + (a3b1 −a1b3)j + (a1b2 −a2b1)k
(4.9)
The cartesian form (4.9) can be more easily remembered in its determinant form 
(actually an accepted misuse of the determinant form)
= (a2b3 −b2a3)i −(a1b3 −b1a3)j + (a1b2 −b1a2)k
(4.10)
This notation is so convenient that we use it here before formally introducing deter-
minants in the next chapter.
An alternative way to work out the cross product, which is easy to memorize, is to
write the vectors (a, b, c) and (A, B, C) twice and read off the components by taking
the products as indicated in Figure 4.39.

Example 4.26
Find the area of the triangle having vertices at P(1, 3, 2), Q(−2, 1, 3) and R(3, −2, −1).
Solution
We have seen in Figure 4.38 that the area of the parallelogram formed with sides PQ
and PR is | p1q@ × p1r2 |, so the area of the triangle PQR is
| p1q2 × p1r2|. Now
p1q2 = (−2 −1, 1 −3, 3 −2) = (−3, −2, 1)
and
p1r2 = (3 −1, −2 −3, −1 −2) = (2, −5, −3)
so that
Hence the area of the triangle PQR is
| p1q2 × p1r2 | =

and the unit vector in the outward normal direction is
From Figure 4.40(b) the area of triangle ABD follows from the deﬁnition of cross 
product as
area =

so the vector we require is
v1 = area × 9 =
d × b
In a similar manner for triangles ACB and ADC the vectors are

For the fourth face BCD the appropriate vector is
v4 =
b1d2 × b1c2 =
(d −b) × (c −b) =
(d × c −d × b −b × c)
Adding the four vectors v1, v2, v3 and v4 together gives the zero vector.

Since the force F has a magnitude of 4 units
The position vector of P relative to A is
a1p2 = (1, 1, −2)
Thus from (4.6) the moment M of the force about A is
= (32/÷45, −24/÷45, 4/÷45)
The moments about axes through A parallel to the coordinate axes are 32/÷45, −24/÷45
and 4/÷45.

Solution
A unit vector in the direction of the axis of rotation is
Thus the angular 
velocity vector of the rigid body is
ω = (5/÷14)(1, 3, −2)
The position vector of P relative to A is
a1p2 = (−2 −2, 3 −3, 1 + 1) = (−4, 0, 2)
Thus from (4.7) the linear velocity of P is
= (30/÷14, 30/÷14, 60/÷14)

Solution
From the data given we can calculate various vectors immediately.
o1a2 = (0, 30, 50),
o1b2 = (60, −50, 0),
o1h2 = (0, 30, 0)
If M is the midpoint of the trapdoor then
o1m2 = (30, 0, 0)
The forces acting are the tension T in the rope along BA, the weight W through M in
the −z direction and reactions R and S at the hinges. Now
a1b2 = o1b2 −o1a2 = (60, −80, −50)
so that |a1b2 | = 112, and hence
T = −T(60, −80, −50)/112
Taking moments about the hinge H, we ﬁrst note that there is no moment of the reaction
at H. For the remaining forces
MH = h1m2 × W + h1b2 × T + h1k2 × R
= (30, −30, 0) × (0, 0, −20) + (60, −80, 0) × (60, −80, −50)(−T/112) + h1k2 × R
= (600, 600, 0) + T(−35.8, −26.8, 0) + h1k2 × R
Since we require the moment about the y axis, we take the scalar product of MH and 
j. The vector h1k2 is along j, so j· (h1k2 × R) must be zero. Thus the j component of MH
must be zero as the trapdoor just opens; that is,
0 = 600 −26.8T
so
T = 22.4 N

Triple products
In Example 4.24, products of several vectors were computed: the product (a × b)·c is
called the triple scalar product and the product (a × b) × c is called the triple vector
product.
Triple scalar product
The triple scalar product is of interest because of its geometrical interpretation. Looking
at Figure 4.45, we see that
a × b = | a | | b | sinθk
= (area of the parallelogram OACB)k
Thus, by deﬁnition,
(a × b)·c = (area of OACB)k· c
= (area of OACB)| k ||c | cos φ
= (area of OACB)h
(where h is the height of the parallelepiped)
= volume of the parallelepiped
Considering (a × b)·c to be the volume of the parallelepiped mounted on a, b, c has
several useful consequences.

4.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS
273
(a) If two of the vectors a, b and c are parallel then (a × b)·c = 0. This follows imme-
diately since the parallelepiped collapses to a plane and has zero volume. In particular,
(a × b)·a = 0
and
(a × b)·b = 0
(b) If the three vectors are coplanar then (a × b)·c = 0. The same reasoning as in (a)
gives this result.
(c) If (a × b)·c = 0 then either a = 0 or b = 0 or c = 0 or two of the vectors are parallel
or the three vectors are coplanar.
(d) In the triple scalar product the dot·and the cross × can be interchanged:
(a × b)·c = a · (b × c)
since it is easily checked that they measure the same volume mounted on a, b, c. If we
retain the same cyclic order of the three vectors then we obtain
a · (b × c) = b · (c × a) = c · (a × b)
(4.11)
(e) In cartesian form the scalar triple product can be written as the determinant
= a1b2c3 −a1b3c2 −a2b1c3 + a2b3c1 + a3b1c2 −a3b2c1
(4.12)
Example 4.31
Find λ so that a = (2, −1, 1), b = (1, 2, −3) and c = (3, λ, 5) are coplanar.
Solution
None of these vectors are zero or parallel, so by property (b) the three vectors are 
coplanar if (a × b)·c = 0. Now
a × b = (1, 7, 5)
so
(a × b)·c = 3 + 7λ + 25
This will be zero, and the three vectors coplanar, when λ = −4.

Example 4.32
In a triangle OAB the sides o1a2 = a and o1b2 = b are given. Find the point P, with 
c = o1p2, where the perpendicular bisectors of the two sides intersect. Hence prove that
the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a point.
Solution
Let 0 be the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the triangle; the situation is illus-
trated in Figure 4.46.
Figure 4.46
Perpendicular

Example 4.32.
Now
o1p2 = o1a2′ + a1′1p2 =
a + α0 × a
for some α, since the vector 0 × a is in the direction perpendicular to a. Similarly
o1p2 = o1b2′ + b1′1p2 =
b + β0 × b
Subtracting these two equations
a + α0 × a =
b + β0 × b
Take the dot product of this equation with b, which eliminates the ﬁnal term, since 
b · (0 × b) = 0, and gives
b · (b −a) = αb·(0 × a)
Hence α has been computed in terms of the known data, so assuming b · (0 × a) ≠0
We now need to check that PQ is perpendicular to AB:

Now take the dot product of these two vectors
Since neither p1q2 nor a1b2 is zero, the two vectors must therefore be perpendicular.
Hence the three perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at a point.
Example 4.33
Three non-zero, non-parallel and non-coplanar vectors a, b and c are given. Three 
further vectors are written in terms of a, b and c as
A = αa + βb + γc
B = α′a + β′b + γ ′c
C = α″a + β″b + γ ″c
Find how the triple scalar product A· (B × C) is related to a· (b × c).
Solution
To ﬁnd the result we use the facts that (i) the vector product of identical vectors is 
zero and (ii) the triple scalar product is zero if two of the vectors in the product are the
same. Now
A · (B × C) = (αa + βb + γc)·[(α′a + β′b + γ ′c) × (α″a + β″b + γ ″c)]
= (αa + βb + γc)·[α′β″a × b + α′γ ″a × c + β′α″b × a
+ β′γ ″b × c + γ ′α″c × a + γ ′β″c × b]
= (αa + βb + γc)·[(α′β″ −β′α″)a × b + (β′γ ″ −γ ′β″)b × c
+ (γ ′α″ −α′γ ″)c × a]
= γ(α′β″ −β′α″)c· a × b + α(β′γ ″ −γ ′β″)a · b × c
+ β(γ ′α″ −α′γ ″)b · c × a
= (a · b × c)[α(β′γ ″ −γ ′β″) + β(γ ′α″ −α′γ ″) + γ(α′β″ −β′α″)]
The result can be written most conveniently in determinant form (see Section 5.3 of the
next chapter) as

as suggested in Example 4.24. We have from (4.9)
a × b = (a2b3 −a3b2, a3b1 −a1b3, a1b2 −a2b1)
and hence
(a × b) × c = ((a3b1 −a1b3)c3 −(a1b2 −a2b1)c2,
(a1b2 −a2b1)c1 −(a2b3 −a3b2)c3,
(a2b3 −a3b2)c2 −(a3b1 −a1b3)c1)
The ﬁrst component of this vector is
a3c3b1 −b3c3a1 −b2c2a1 + a2c2b1 = (a1c1 + a2c2 + a3c3)b1 −(b1c1 + b2c2 + b3c3)a1
= (a · c)b1 −(b · c)a1
Treating the second and third components similarly, we ﬁnd
(a × b) × c = ((a · c)b1 −(b · c)a1, (a · c)b2 −(b · c)a2, (a · c)b3 −(b · c)a3)
= (a · c)b −(b · c)a
In a similar way we can show that
a × (b × c) = (a · c)b −(a· b)c
(4.14)
We can now see why the associativity of the vector product does not hold in general.
The vector in (4.13) is in the plane of b and a, while the vector in (4.14) is in the plane
of b and c; hence they are not in the same planes in general, as we inferred geometric-
ally in Section 4.2.10. Consequently, in general 
a × (b × c) ≠(a × b) × c
so use of brackets is essential.
Example 4.34
If a = (3, −2, 1), b = (−1, 3, 4) and c = (2, 1, −3), conﬁrm that
a × (b × c) = (a · c)b −(a· b)c

= (−1, 3, 4) + 5(2, 1, −3)
= (9, 8, −11)
thus conﬁrming the result
a × (b × c) = (a · c)b −(a · b)c
Example 4.35
Verify that a × (b × c) ≠(a × b) × c for the three vectors a = (1, 0, 0), b = (−1, 2, 0) and 
c = (1, 1, 1).
Solution
Evaluate the cross products in turn:
b × c = (−1, 2, 0) × (1, 1, 1) = (2, 1, −3)
and therefore
a × (b × c) = (1, 0, 0) × (2, 1, −3) = (0, 3, 1)
Similarly for the right-hand side:
a × b = (1, 0, 0) × (−1, 2, 0) = (0, 0, 2)
and hence
(a × b) × c = (0, 0, 2) × (1, 1, 1) = (−2, 2, 0)
Clearly for these three vectors a × (b × c) ≠(a × b) × c.
Example 4.36
The vectors a, b and c and the scalar p satisfy the equations
a · b = p
and
a × b = c
and a is not parallel to b. Solve for a in terms of the other quantities and give a geo-
metrical interpretation of the result.
Solution
First evaluate the cross product of the second equation with b
b × (a × b) = b × c
gives
(b · b)a −(b · a)b = b × c
and hence, using a · b = p, and collecting the terms
Since b × c is in the plane of a and b, any vector in the plane can be written as a linear
combination of b and b × c. The expression for a gives the values of the coefﬁcients in
the linear combination.

4.3
The vector treatment of the geometry of lines 
and planes
4.3.1
Vector equation of a line
Take an arbitrary origin O and let o1a2 = a, o1b2 = b and o1p2 = r, as in Figure 4.47. If P
is any point on the line then
o1p2 = o1a2 + a1p2,
by the triangle law
giving
r = a + ta1b2
(since a1p2 is a multiple of a1b2)
= a + t(b −a)
(since a + a1b2 = b)
Thus the equation of the line is
r = (1 −t)a + tb
(4.15)
As t varies from −∞to +∞, the point P sweeps along the line, with t = 0 corresponding
to point A and t = 1 to point B.
Since o1p2 = o1a2 + a1p2 = o1a2 + ta1b2, we have r = a + t(b −a). If we write c = b −a
then we have an alternative intepretation of a line through A in the direction c:
r = a + tc
(4.16)
The cartesian or component form of this equation is
(4.17)
where a = (a1, a2, a3) and c = (c1, c2, c3). Alternatively the cartesian equation of (4.15)
may be written in the form
where a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3) are two points on the line. If any of the 
denominators is zero, then both forms of the equation of a line are interpreted as the
corresponding numerator is zero.
Example 4.37
Find the equation of the lines L1 through the points (0, 1, 0) and (1, 3, −1) and L2
through (1, 1, 1) and (−1, −1, 1). Do the two lines intersect and, if so, at what point?
Solution
From (4.15) L1 has the equation

and L2 has the equation
r = (1 −s, 1 −s, 1 −s) + (−s, −s, s) = (1 −2s, 1 − 2s, 1)
Note that the cartesian equation of L2 reduces to x = y; z = 1. The two lines intersect if
it is possible to ﬁnd s and t such that
t = 1 − 2s,
1 + 2t = 1 −2s,
−t = 1
Solving two of these equations will give the values of s and t. If these values satisfy the
remaining equation then the lines intersect; however, if they do not satisfy the remaining
equation then the lines do not intersect. In this particular case, the third equation gives
t = −1 and the ﬁrst equation s = 1. Putting these values into the second equation the 
left-hand side equals −1 and the right-hand side equals −1, so the equations are all
satisﬁed and therefore the lines intersect. Substituting back into either equation, the
point of intersection is (−1, −1, 1).
Example 4.38
The position vectors of the points A and B are
(1, 4, 6)
and
(3, 5, 7)
Find the vector equation of the line AB and ﬁnd the points where the line intersects the
coordinate planes.
Solution
The line has equation
r = (1, 4, 6) + t(2, 1, 1)
or in components
x = 1 + 2t
y = 4 + t
z = 6 + t
Thus the line meets the y–z plane when x = 0 and hence t =
and the point of 
intersection with the plane is (0, 
).
The line meets the z–x plane when y = 0 and hence t = −4 and the point of intersection
with the plane is (−7, 0, 2).
The line meets the x–y plane when z = 0 and hence t = −6 and the point of intersection
with the plane is (−11, −2, 0).

4.3 THE VECTOR TREATMENT OF THE GEOMETRY OF LINES AND PLANES
281
Solution
Using the vector form:
From (4.15) the equations of the two lines can be written in vector form as
L1:
r = (5, 1, 7) + t(1, −1, 1)
L2:
r = (3, 1, 3) + s(−4, 2, α −3)
These two lines intersect if t, s and α can be chosen so that the two vectors are equal,
that is, they have the same components. Thus
5 + t = 3 −4s
1 −t = 1 + 2s
7 + t = 3 + s(α −3)
The ﬁrst two of these equations are simultaneous equations for t and s. Solving gives 
t = 2 and s = −1. Putting these values into the third equation
9 = 3 −(α −3) ⇒α = −3
and it can be checked that the point of intersection is (7, −1, 9).
Using the cartesian form:
Equation (4.17) gives the equations of the lines as
L1:
L2:
The two equations for x and y are
x −5 = 1 −y
(3 −x) =
(y −1)
and are solved to give x = 7 and y = −1. Putting in these values, the equations for z and
α become
z −7 = 2
which give z = 9 and α = −3.
Example 4.40

VECTOR ALGEBRA
Solution
The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.48. The equation of the path of the aeroplane is
r = (−500, 0, 1000) + t(900, 400, 50)
The new path starts at the point (400, 400, 1050). The vector a1b2 × 0 is a vector in the
direction b1d2 which is perpendicular to 0, and is therefore horizontal, and at 90° to 
AB in the easterly direction. Thus we have a 90° turn to horizontal ﬂight. Since
(900, 400, 0) × k = (400, −900, 0)
the new path is
r = (400, 400, 1050) + s(400, −900, 0)
Equating the components
x = 400 + 400s
y = 400 −900s
z = 1050
In cartesian coordinates the equations are
9x + 4y = 5200
z = 1050

The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.49. The direction of the pipeline is
d = (0, 15, 32) −(20, 20, 30) = (−20, −5, 2). 
Thus any point on the pipeline will have position vector
r = (20, 20, 30) + t(−20, −5, 2)

for some t. Note that this is just the equation of the line given in (4.15). At the shortest
distance from O to the pipeline the vector r = o1p2 is perpendicular to d, so r· d = 0 gives
the required condition to evaluate t. Thus
(−20, −5, 2)·[(20, 20, 30) + t(−20, −5, 2)] = 0
and hence −440 + 429t = 0. Putting this value back into r gives
r = (−0.51, 14.87, 32.05)
Note that the value of t is close to 1, so the optimum point is not far from the second of
the points located.

Find the shortest distance between the two skew lines
Also determine the equation of the common perpendicular. (Note that two lines are said
to be skew if they do not intersect and are not parallel.)
Solution
In vector form the equations of the lines are
r = (0, 9, 2) + t(3, −1, 1)
and
r = (−6, −5, 10) + s(−3, 2, 4)
The shortest distance between the two lines will be their common perpendicular; see

position vectors r1 and r2 respectively, where

Then the vector p121p112 is given by
p121p112 = r1 −r2 = (6, 14, −8) + t1(3, −1, 1) −t2(−3, 2, 4)
(4.18)
Since (3, −1, 1) and (−3, 2, 4) are vectors in the direction of each of the lines, it 
follows that a vector n perpendicular to both lines is
n = (−3, 2, 4) × (3, −1, 1) = (6, 15, −3)
So a unit vector perpendicular to both lines is
T = (6, 15, −3)/÷270 = (2, 5, −1)/÷30
Thus we can also express p121p112 as
p121p112 = dT
where d is the shortest distance between the two lines.
Equating the two expressions for p121p112 gives
(6, 14, −8) + t1(3, −1, 1) −t2(−3, 2, 4) = (2, 5, −1)d/÷30
Taking the scalar product throughout with the vector (2, 5, −1) gives
(6, 14, −8) · (2, 5, −1) + t1(3, −1, 1) · (2, 5, −1) −t2(−3, 2, 4) · (2, 5, −1)
= (2, 5, −1) · (2, 5, −1)d/÷30
which reduces to
90 + 0t1 + 0t2 = 30d/÷30
giving the shortest distance between the two lines as
d = 3÷30
To obtain the equation of the common perpendicular, we need to ﬁnd the coordinates
of either P1 or P2 – and to achieve this we need to ﬁnd the value of either t1 or t2. We
therefore take the scalar product of (4.18) with (3, −1, 1) and (−3, 2, 4) in turn, giving
respectively
11t1 + 7t2 = 4
and
−7t1 −29t2 = 22
which on solving simultaneously give t1 = 1 and t2 = −1. Hence the coordinates of the
end points P1 and P2 of the common perpendicular are

where 0  α  1 to ensure that Q lies between O and C. The line RS passes through

Note that if c = 0 then we are looking parallel to the open top and can only see the

negative, so that all of the side OC is visible. For 0  c  a the parameter α lies between
0 and 1, and only part of the line is visible. A similar analysis needs to be performed for

4.3.3
Vector equation of a plane
To obtain the equation of a plane, we use the result that the line joining any two points
in the plane is perpendicular to the normal to the plane, as illustrated in Figure 4.52. The
vector n is perpendicular to the plane, a is the position vector of a given point A in the
plane and r is the position vector of any point P on the plane. The vector a1p2 = r −a is
perpendicular to n, and hence
(r −a)·n = 0
so that
r · n = a · n
or
r · n = p
(4.19)
is the general form for the equation of a plane with normal n. In the particular case
when n is a unit vector, p in (4.19) represents the perpendicular distance from the 
origin to the plane. In cartesian form we take n = (α, β, γ), and the equation becomes
αx + βy + γz = p
(4.20)
which is just a linear relation between the variables x, y and z.
Example 4.44
Find the equation of the plane through the three points
a = (1, 1, 1),
b = (0, 1, 2)
and
c = (−1, 1, −1)
Solution
The vectors a −b = (1, 0, −1) and a −c = (2, 0, 2) will lie in the plane. The normal n
to the plane can thus be constructed as (a −b) × (a −c), giving
n = (1, 0, −1) × (2, 0, 2) = (0, −4, 0)
Thus from (4.19) the equation of the plane is given by
r · n = a · n
or
r ·(0, −4, 0) = (1, 1, 1) · (0, −4, 0)
giving
r ·(0, −4, 0) = −4
In cartesian form
(x, y, z)·(0, −4, 0) = −4
or simply y = 1.

and
a(0, 1, 2)
LP2
through a(0, 0, 2),
a(1, 1, 0)
and
a(0, 1, 0)
Solution
The direction perpendicular to LP1 is (1, 1, 0) × (0, 1, 2) = (2, −2, 1) and hence the 
equation of LP1 is
r ·(2, −2, 1) = 0
or in cartesian form
2x −2y + z = 0
(4.21)
The direction perpendicular to LP2 is (1, 1, −2) × (0, 1, −2) = (0, 2, 1) and hence the
equation of LP2 is
r ·(0, 2, 1) = 2
or in cartesian form
2y + z = 2
(4.22)
Points that lie on both lattice planes must satisfy both (4.21) and (4.22). It is easiest to
solve these equations in their cartesian form. The coordinates must be integers, so take
y = m, then z can easily be calculated from (4.22) as
z = 2 −2m
and then x is computed from (4.21) to be x = 2m −1.
Hence the required points all lie on a line and take the form
r = a(2m −1, m, 2 −2m)
where m is an integer.
Example 4.46
Find the point where the plane
r ·(1, 1, 2) = 3
meets the line
r = (2, 1, 1) + λ(0, 1, 2)
Solution
At the point of intersection, r must satisfy both equations, so
[(2, 1, 1) + λ(0, 1, 2)]·(1, 1, 2) = 3
or
5 + 5λ = 3
so
λ =

4.3 THE VECTOR TREATMENT OF THE GEOMETRY OF LINES AND PLANES
289
Solution
In vector form the equations of the two planes are
r ·(1, 1, 1) = 5
and
r ·(4, 1, 2) = 15
The required line lies in both planes, and is therefore perpendicular to the vectors (1, 1, 1)
and (4, 1, 2), which are normal to the individual planes. Hence a vector c in the direction
of the line is
c = (1, 1, 1) × (4, 1, 2) = (1, 2, −3)
To ﬁnd the equation of the line, it remains only to ﬁnd the coordinates of any point on the
line. To do this, we are required to ﬁnd the coordinates of a point satisfying the equation
of the two planes. Taking x = 0, the corresponding values of y and z are given by
y + z = 5
and
y + 2z = 15
that is, y = −5 and z = 10. Hence it can be checked that the point (0, −5, 10) lies in both
planes and is therefore a point on the line. From (4.16) the equation of the line is
r = (0, −5, 10) + t(1, 2, −3)
or in cartesian form

Example 4.48
Find the perpendicular distance from the point P(2, −3, 4) to the plane x + 2y + 2z = 13.
Solution
In vector form the equation of the plane is
r ·(1, 2, 2) = 13
and a vector perpendicular to the plane is
n = (1, 2, 2)
Thus from (4.16) the equation of a line perpendicular to the plane and passing through
P(2, −3, 4) is
r = (2, −3, 4) + t(1, 2, 2)
This will meet the plane when
r ·(1, 2, 2) = (2, −3, 4) · (1, 2, 2) + t(1, 2, 2) · (1, 2, 2) = 13

Engineering application: spin-dryer suspension
Vectors are at their most powerful when dealing with complicated three-dimensional
situations. Geometrical and physical intuition are often difﬁcult to use, and it becomes
necessary to work quite formally to analyse such situations. For example, the front 
suspension of a motor car has two struts supported by a spring-and-damper system and
subject to a variety of forces and torques from both the car and the wheels. To analyse
the stresses and the vibrations in the various components of the structure is non-trivial,
even in a two-dimensional version; the true three-dimensional problem provides a testing
exercise for even the most experienced automobile engineer. In the present text a much
simpler situation is analysed to illustrate the use of vectors.
4.4.1
Point-particle model
As with the car suspension, many machines are mounted on springs to isolate vibra-
tions. A typical example is a spin-dryer, which consists of a drum connected to the 
casing by heavy springs. Oscillations can be very severe when spinning at high speed,
and it is essential to know what forces are transmitted to the casing and hence to the
mounts. Before the dynamical situation can be analysed, it is necessary to compute 
the restoring forces on the drum when it is displaced from its equilibrium position. This
is a static problem that is best studied using vectors.
We model the spin-dryer as a heavy point particle connected to the eight corners of
the casing by springs (Figure 4.53). The drum has weight W and the casing is taken to
be a cube of side 2L. The springs are all equal, having spring constant k and natural

length L÷3. Thus when the drum is at the midpoint of the cube the springs are neither
compressed nor extended.
The particle is displaced from its central position by a small amount (a, b, c), where
the natural coordinates illustrated in Figure 4.53 are used; the origin is at the centre of
the cube and the axes are parallel to the sides. What is required is the total force acting
on the particle arising from the weight and the springs. Clearly, this information is
needed before any dynamical calculations can be performed. It will be assumed that the
displacements are sufﬁciently small that squares (a/L)2, (b/L)2, (c/L)2 and higher powers
are neglected.
Consider a typical spring PA. The tension in the spring is assumed to obey Hooke’s 
law: that the force is along PA and has magnitude proportional to extension. p1a2/| p1a2 |
is the unit vector in the direction along PA, and |p1a2| −L÷3 is the extension of the spring
over its natural length L÷3, so in vector form the tension can be written as
(4.23)
where k is the proportionality constant. 
Now
p1a2 = o1a2 −o1p2 = (L −a, L −b, L −c)
so calculating the modulus squared gives
| p1a2 |2 = (L −a)2 + (L −b)2 + (L −c)2
= 3L2 −2L(a + b + c) + quadratic terms
Thus
and, on using the binomial expansion (see equation (7.16)) and neglecting quadratic
and higher terms, we obtain
Putting the information acquired back into (4.23) gives
and by expanding again, using the binomial expansion to ﬁrst order in a/L and so on,
we obtain

(a + b + c)(1, 1, 1)
Similar calculations give

The total spring force is therefore obtained by adding these eight tensions together:
T =
(a, b, c)
The restoring force is therefore towards the centre of the cube, as expected, in the 
direction PO and with magnitude
times the length of PO.
When the weight is included, the total force is
If the drum just hangs in equilibrium then F = 0, and hence
a = b = 0
and
Typical values are W = 400 N and k = 10 000 N m−1, and hence
c = −3 × 400/8 × 10000 = −0.015 m
so that the centre of the drum hangs 1.5cm below the midpoint of the centre of the casing.
It is clear that the model used in this section is an idealized one, but it is helpful in
describing how to calculate spring forces in complicated three-dimensional static 
situations. It also gives an idea of the size of the forces involved and the deﬂections. The
next major step is to put these forces into the equations of motion of the drum; this,
however, requires a good knowledge of calculus – and, in particular, of differential
equations – so it is not appropriate at this point. You may wish to consider this problem
after studying the relevant chapters later in this book. A more advanced model must
include the fact that the drum is of ﬁnite size.

Engineering application: cable-stayed bridge
One of the standard methods of supporting bridges is with cables. Readers will no doubt
be familiar with suspension bridges such as the Golden Gate in the USA, the Humber
bridge in the UK and the Tsing Ma bridge in Hong Kong with their spectacular form.
Cable-stayed bridges are similar in that they have towers and cables that support a 
roadway but they are not usually on such a grand scale as suspension bridges. They 
are often used when the foundations can only support a single tower at one end of the
roadway. They are commonly seen on bridges over motorways and footbridges over
steep narrow valleys.
In any of the situations described it is essential that information is available on the
tension in the wire supports and the forces on the towers. The geometry is fully three-
dimensional and quite complicated. Vectors provide a logical and efﬁcient way of dealing
with the situation.

4.5.1
A simple stayed bridge
There are many conﬁgurations that stayed bridges can take; they can have one or more
towers and a variety of arrangements of stays. In Figure 4.54 a simple example of a
cable-stayed footbridge is illustrated. It is constructed with a central vertical pillar with
four ties attached by wires to the sides of the pathway.
Relative to the axes, with the z axis vertical, the various points are given, in metres,
as A(5, −2, 0.5), B(10, 2, 1), C(15, −2, 1.5), D(20, 2, 1) and S(0, 0, 10). Assuming the
weight is evenly distributed, there is an equivalent weight of 2 KN at each of the four
points A, B, C and D. An estimate is required of the tensions in the wires and the force
at the tie point S.
The vectors along the ties can easily be evaluated:
a1s2 = (−5, 2, 9.5),
b1s2 = (−10, −2, 9)
c1s2 = (−15, 2, 8.5),
d1s2 = (−20, −2, 9)
The tension at S in the tie AS can be written TA = tAs1a2. Assuming the whole system is
in equilibrium, the vertical components at A must be equal
TA· k = 2
and hence
and the four tensions can be computed similarly.
TA =
(5, −2, −9.5) = (1.052, −0.421, −2)
and
| TA| = 2.299 kN
TB =
(10, 2, −9) = (2.222, 0.444, −2)
and
| TB | = 3.022 kN
TC =
(15, −2, −8.5) = (3.529, −0.471, −2)
and
| TC | = 4.084 kN
TD =
(20, 2, −9) = (4.444, 0.444, −2)
and
| TD| = 4.894 kN
The total force acting at the tie point S is
T = TA + TB + TC + TD = (11.25, −0.004, −8)
Thus with straightforward addition of vectors we have been able to compute the 
tensions and the total force on the tower.
The question now is how to compensate for the total force on the tower and to try to
ensure that it is subject to zero force or a force as small as possible. Suppose that it is
decided to have just a single compensating tie wire attached to S and to one side on the
pathway at P. It is assumed that on this side of the footbridge the pathway is ﬂat and
lies in the x–y plane. Where should we position the attachment of the compensating
wire so that it produces zero horizontal force at S?

Given that a = 3i −j −4k, b = −2i + 4j −3k and 
c = i + 2j −k, ﬁnd
(a) the magnitude of the vector a + b + c;
(b) a unit vector parallel to 3a −2b + 4c;
(c) the angles between the vectors a and b and
between b and c;
(d) the position vector of the centre of mass of
particles of masses 1, 2 and 3 placed at points A, 
B and C with position vectors a, b and c
respectively.

If the vertices X, Y and Z of a triangle have 
position vectors
x = (2, 2, 6), y = (4, 6, 4) and z = (4, 1, 7)
relative to the origin O, ﬁnd
(a) the midpoint of the side XY of the triangle;
(b) the area of the triangle;
(c) the volume of the tetrahedron OXYZ.
3
The vertices of a tetrahedron are the points
W(2, 1, 3),
X(3, 3, 3),
Y(4, 2, 4)
and
Z(3, 3, 5)
Determine
(a) the vectors w1x2 and w1y2;
(b) the area of the face WXZ;
(c) the volume of the tetrahedron WXZY;
(d) the angles between the faces WXY and WYZ.
Let the attachment point P on the side of the footbridge be (−a, 2, 0) so that the 
tension in the compensating cable is
TP = tPs1p2 = tP(−a, 2, −10)
We require the y component of (T + TP) to be zero so that
2tP −0.004 = 0
and hence
tP = 0.002
which in turn gives for the x component
atP = 11.248
and hence
a = 5624 metres!
Clearly the answer is ridiculous and either more than one compensating cable must be
used or the y component can be neglected completely since the force in this direction is
only 4 N.
As a second attempt we specify the attachment wire at P(−5, 2, 0). Requiring the x
component of T + TP to be zero we see that
T + TP = T + tPs1p2 = (11.25, −0.004, −8) + tP(−5, 2, −10)
gives tP = 2.25. Hence the total force at S is (0, 4.5, −30.5). Although the force in the x
direction has been reduced to zero, an unacceptable side force on the tower in the y
direction has been introduced.
In a further effort, we introduce two equal compensating wires connected to the
points P(−5, −2, 0) and P′(−5, 2, 0). The total force at S is now
T + TP + TP′ = T + tPs1p2 + tPs1p1′2
= (11.25, −0.004, −8) + tP(−5, 2, −10) + tP(−5, −2, −10)
Now choosing tP = 1.125 gives a total force (0, −0.004, −30.5). We now have a 
satisfactory resolution of the problem with the only signiﬁcant force being in the down-
wards direction.
The different forms of stayed-bridge construction will require a similar analysis 
to obtain an estimate of the forces involved. The example given should be viewed as
illustrative.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
299
5.1
Introduction
The solution of simultaneous equations is part of elementary algebra. Many engineering
problems can be formulated in terms of simultaneous equations, but in most practical
situations the number of equations is extremely large and traditional methods of solu-
tion are not feasible. Even the question of whether solutions exist is not easy to answer.
Setting the equations up in matrix form provides a systematic way of answering this
question and also suggests practical methods of solution. Over the past 150 years or 
so, a large number of matrix techniques have been developed, and many have been
applied to the solution of engineering and scientiﬁc problems. The advent of quantum
mechanics and the matrix representation developed by Heisenberg did much to stimu-
late their popularity, since scientists and engineers were then able to appreciate the 
convenience and economy of matrix formulations.
In many problems the relationships between vector quantities can be represented by
matrices. We saw in Chapter 4 that vectors in three dimensions are represented by three
numbers (x1, x2, x3) with respect to some coordinate system. If the coordinate system is
changed, the representation of the vector changes to another triple (x′1, x′2, x′3), related
to the original through a matrix. In this three-dimensional case the matrix is a 3 × 3
array of numbers. Such matrices satisfy various addition and multiplication properties,
which we shall develop in this chapter, and indeed it is change of axes that provides the
most natural way of introducing the matrix product.
In the previous chapter we noted that forces provide an excellent example of vectors
and that they have wide use in engineering. When we are dealing with a continuous
medium – for instance when we try to specify the forces in a beam or an aircraft wing
or the forces due to the ﬂow of a ﬂuid – we have to extend our ideas and deﬁne the stress
at a point. This can be represented by a 3 × 3 matrix, and matrix algebra is therefore
required for a better understanding of the mathematical manipulations involved.
Perhaps the major impact on engineering applications came with the advent of 
computers since these are ideally set up to deal with vectors and arrays (matrices), and
matrix formulations of problems are therefore already in a form highly suitable for
computation. Indeed, all of the widely used aspects of matrices are incorporated into
most computer packages, either just for calculation or for the algebraic manipulation of
matrices. Packages that are currently popular with students include MATLAB, which
is highly suitable for numerical computation, and either, MAPLE or the Symbolic Math
Toolbox in MATLAB, for algebraic manipulation. These packages are used throughout
this chapter.
Many physical problems can be modelled using differential equations, and such models
form the basis of much modern science and technology. Most of these equations 
cannot be solved analytically because of their complexity, and it is necessary to revert
to numerical solution. This almost always involves convenient vector and matrix 
formulations. For instance, a popular method of analysing structures is in terms of ﬁnite
elements. Finite-element packages have been developed over the past 50 years or so 
to deal with problems having 105 or more variables. A major part of such packages
involves setting up the data in matrix form and then solving the resulting matrix 
equations. They are now used to design large buildings, to stress aircraft, to determine
the ﬂow through a turbine, to study waveguides and in many other situations of great
interest to engineers and scientists.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
In most of the previous comments, matrices are used to simplify the notation in prob-
lems that require the solution of sets of linear equations. It is in this context that engi-
neers and scientists usually encounter matrices. The chapter will therefore focus largely
on matrix properties and methods that relate to the solution of such linear equations.
5.2
Basic concepts, deﬁnitions and properties
Some examples will be used to introduce the basic concepts of matrices which will then
be formally deﬁned and developed. In particular, they will illustrate the matrix product,
which is the most interesting property in the theory since it enables complicated sets of
equations to be written in a convenient and compact way.
Intersection of planes
The ﬁrst example is one from geometry. In Section 4.3.3, we saw that the equation of
a plane can be written in the form
αx + βy + γz = p
where α, β, γ and p are constants. The four planes
(5.1)
meet in a single point. What are the coordinates of that point? Obviously they are those
values of x, y and z that satisfy all four of (5.1) simultaneously.
Equations (5.1) provide an example of a mathematical problem that arises in a wide
range of engineering problems: the simultaneous solution of a set of linear equations,
as mentioned in the introduction. The general form of a linear equation is the sum of a
set of variables, each multiplied only by a numerical factor, set equal to a constant. No
variable is raised to any power or multiplied by any other variable. In this case we have
four linear equations in three variables x, y and z. We shall see that there is a large body
of mathematical theory concerning the solution of such equations.
As is common in mathematics, one of the ﬁrst stages in solving the problem is to
introduce a better notation to represent the problem. In this case we introduce the idea
of an array of numbers called a matrix. We write
and call A a 4 × 3 (read as ‘4 by 3’) matrix; that is, a matrix with four rows and three
columns. We also introduce an alternative notation for a vector, writing
A

5.2 BASIC CONCEPTS, DEFINITIONS AND PROPERTIES

We call these column vectors; they are 3 × 1 and 4 × 1 matrices respectively. Equations
(5.1) can then be expressed in the form
AX = b
where the product of the matrix A and the vector X is understood to produce the left-
hand sides of (5.1).
Change of axes
In many problems it is convenient to change rectangular axes Oxy coordinates to a new
Ox′y′ coordinate system by rotating the Oxy system anticlockwise about the origin O
through an angle θ, as illustrated in Figure 5.1. We then seek the relation between the
coordinates (x, y) of a point P in the Oxy system and the coordinates (x′, y′) of P in the
Ox′y′ system. Trigonometry gives
x = r cos φ,
y = r sin φ
and
x′ = r cos(φ −θ),
y′ = r sin(φ −θ)
Expanding the trigonometrical expressions gives
x′ = r cos φ cos θ + r sin φ sin θ = x cos θ + y sin θ
(5.2)
y′ = r sin φ cos θ −r cos φ sin θ = y cos θ −x sin θ

then (5.2) can be written in standard matrix notation as
X′ = BX
We see that a change of axes can be written in a natural manner in matrix form, with B
containing all the information about the transformation.
‘Ore’ problem
A more physical problem concerns the mixing of ores. Three ores are known to contain
fractions of Pb, Fe, Cu and Mn as indicated in Figure 5.2. If we mix the ores so that there
are x1 kg of ore 1, x2 kg of ore 2 and x3 kg of ore 3 then we can compute the amount of
each element as
(5.3)
We can rewrite the array in Figure 5.2 as a matrix
and if we deﬁne the vectors
then the equations can be written in matrix form
M = AX
with the product interpreted as in (5.3). The matrix A has 4 rows and 3 columns, so 
it is a 4 × 3 matrix. M and X are column vectors; they are 4 × 1 and 3 × 1 matrices
respectively.

In each of these examples arrays A and B and vectors X and X′ appear in a natural
way, and the method of multiplication of the arrays and vectors is consistent. We build
on this idea to deﬁne matrices generally.
5.2.1
Deﬁnitions
An array of real numbers
(5.4)
is called a matrix of order m × n, with m rows and n columns. The entry aij denotes the 
element in the ith row and jth column. The element can be real or complex (but in this
chapter we deal mainly with real matrices). If m = n then the array is square, and A is
then called a square matrix of order n. If the matrix has one column or one row
(5.5)
then it is called a column vector or a row vector respectively. The row vector was used
in Section 4.2.2 as the basic deﬁnition of a vector, but in matrix theory a vector is nor-
mally taken to be a column vector unless otherwise stated. This slight inconsistency in
the notation between vector theory and matrix theory can be inconvenient, but it is so
standard in the literature that we must accept it. We have to get used to vectors appear-
ing in several different notations. It is also a common convention to use upper-case let-
ters to represent matrices and lower-case ones for vectors. We shall adopt this
convention in this chapter with one exception: the vectors
will be denoted by X. (Vectors and matrices are further distinguished here by the use
of a ‘serif’ bold face for the former (e.g. b) and a ‘sans serif’ bold face for the latter
(e.g. A).) As an example of the notation used, consider the matrix A and the vector b
The matrix A is a 2 × 3 matrix with elements a11 = 0, a12 = −1, a13 = 2, a21 = 3 and so
on. The vector b is a column vector with elements b1 = 0.15, b2 = 1.11 and b3 = −3.01.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
In a square matrix of order n the diagonal containing the elements a11, a22, … , ann is
called the principal, main or leading diagonal. The sum of the elements of the leading
diagonal is called the trace of the square matrix A, that is
trace A = a11 + a22 + … + ann =
A diagonal matrix is a square matrix that has its only non-zero elements along the
leading diagonal. (It may have zeros on the leading diagonal also.)
An important special case of a diagonal matrix is the unit matrix or identity matrix I,
for which a11 = a22 = … = ann = 1.
The unit matrix can be written conveniently in terms of the Kronecker delta. This is
deﬁned as
The unit matrix thus has elements δij. The notation In is sometimes used to denote the
n × n unit matrix where its size is important or not clear.
The zero or null matrix is the matrix with every element zero, and is written as
either 0 or 0. Sometimes a zero matrix of order m × n is written Om×n.
The transposed matrix AT of (5.4) is the matrix with elements bij = aji and is written
in full as the n × m matrix

This is just the matrix in (5.4) with rows and columns interchanged. We may note from
(5.5) that
so that a column vector is transposed to a row vector and vice versa.
If a square matrix is such that AT = A then aij = aji, and the elements are therefore
symmetric about the diagonal. Such a matrix is called a symmetric matrix; symmetric
matrices play important roles in many computations. If AT = −A, so that aij = −aji, the
matrix is called skew-symmetric or antisymmetric. Obviously the diagonal elements
of a skew-symmetric matrix satisfy aii = −aii and so must all be zero.
A few examples will illustrate these deﬁnitions:

trace D = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

MATRIX ALGEBRA
5.2.2
Basic operations of matrices
(a) Equality
Two matrices A and B are said to be equal if and only if all their elements are the same,
aij = bij for 1  i  m, 1  j  n, and this equality is written as
A = B
Note that this requires the two matrices to be of the same order m × n.
(b) Addition and subtraction
Addition of matrices is straightforward; we can only add an m × n matrix to another 
m × n matrix, and an element of the sum is the sum of the corresponding elements. 
If A has elements aij and B has elements bij then A + B has elements aij + bij.
Similarly for subtraction, A −B has elements aij −bij.
(c) Multiplication by a scalar
The matrix λA has elements λaij; that is, we just multiply each element by the scalar λ
(d) Properties of the transpose
From the deﬁnition, the transpose of a matrix is such that
(A + B)T = AT + BT
Similarly, we observe that
(AT)T = A
so that transposing twice gives back the original matrix.

5.2 BASIC CONCEPTS, DEFINITIONS AND PROPERTIES

We may note as a special case of this result that for a square matrix A
(AT + A)T = (AT)T + AT = A + AT
and hence AT + A must be a symmetric matrix. This proves to be a very useful result,
which we shall see used in several places. Similarly, A −AT is a skew-symmetric
matrix, so that any square matrix A may be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a
skew-symmetric matrix:
A =
(A + AT) +
(A −AT)
(e) Basic rules of addition
Because the usual rules of arithmetic are followed in the deﬁnitions of the sum of 
matrices and of multiplication by scalars, the
commutative law
A + B = B + A
associative law
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
and
distributive law
λ(A + B) = λA + λB
all hold for matrices.
Example 5.1
Let
Find, where possible, (a) A + B, (b) A + C, (c) C −A, (d) 3A, (e) 4B, (f) C + B,
(g) 3A + 2C, (h) AT + A and (i) A + CT + BT.
Solution
(a) A + B is not possible, since A is 3 × 3 and B is 3 × 2.

β + γ = 0
γ −δ = 0
The ﬁrst equation gives β = −α, the third gives γ = −β = α and the fourth δ = γ = α.
Substituting, the second equation is satisﬁed identically. Thus for any t the solution 
α = t, β = −t, γ = t, δ = t satisﬁes all the equations.
The important concept of linear dependence/independence is illustrated in Example
5.3. It will be used later in the chapter and particularly in Section 5.7.4 in the discus-
sion of the number of eigenvectors associated with a repeated eigenvalue. The vectors
a1, a2, . . . , an form a linearly independent set if the only solution to the equation
α1a1 + α2a2 + . . . + αnan = 0
is α1 = α2 = . . . = αn = 0. Otherwise the set is said to be linearly dependent. Note that
in Example 5.3 the vectors in (a) are linearly independent and those in (b) are linearly
dependent.
All the basic matrix operations may be implemented in MATLAB and MAPLE
using simple commands.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
MATLAB
A matrix is entered as an array, with
row elements separated by a space 
(or a comma) and each row of elements
separated by a semicolon. Thus, for
example
A = [1 2 3; 4 0 5; 7 6 2]
gives A as
A =
1
2
3
4
0
5
7

The transpose of a matrix is written A’,
with an apostrophe.
A’ = 
1
4
7
2
0
6
3

2
and trace(A) produces the obvious
answer = 3.
Having speciﬁed two matrices A and
B the usual operations are written
C = A + B, C = A – B
and multiplication with a scalar as
C = 2*A + 3*B
MAPLE
There are several ways of setting up
arrays in MAPLE; the simplest is to use
the linear algebra package
with (linalg):
array([list of elements]);
Thus, for example
A:=array([[1,2,3],[4,0,5],
[7,6,2]]);
produces
1
2
3
A = 4
0

2
The transpose and trace are obtained from
transpose(A); and trace(A);
Having speciﬁed two matrices A and B
the usual operations are written
C := evalm (A + B); and 
C := evalm (A – B);
because MAPLE is a symbolic package.
The evaluation of the multiplication of a
matrix by a scalar requires the command
C:= evalm(2*A + 3*B);

Matrix multiplication
The most important property of matrices as far as their practical applications are con-
cerned is the multiplication of one matrix by another. We saw informally in Section 5.2
how multiplication arose and how to deﬁne multiplication of a matrix and a vector. The
idea can be extended further by looking again at change of axes. We consider three
coordinate systems in a plane, denoted by Ox1x2, Oy1y2, Oz1z2 and related by the linear
transformations, illustrated as mappings A and B in Figure 5.3.
z1 = a11y1 + a12y2,
y1 = b11x1 + b12x2
z2 = a21y1 + a22y2,
y2 = b21x1 + b22x2
We then seek the composite transformation that expresses z1, z2 in terms of x1, x2. This
we can do by straight substitution:
z1 = (a11b11 + a12b21)x1 + (a11b12 + a12b22)x2
z2 = (a21b11 + a22b21)x1 + (a21b12 + a22b22)x2

If we write the ﬁrst two transformations as
then the composite transformation is written
and this is precisely how we deﬁne the matrix product.
Deﬁnition
If A is an m × p matrix with elements aij and B a p × n matrix with elements bij then we
deﬁne the product C = AB as the m × n matrix with components
for i = 1, … , m
and
j = 1, … , n
In pictorial form, the ith row of A is multiplied term by term with the jth column of
B and the products are added to form the ijth component of C. This is commonly
referred to as the ‘row-by-column’ method of multiplication. Clearly, in order for multi-
plication to be possible, A must have p columns and B must have p rows otherwise the
product AB is not deﬁned.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
expression X TX just gives the square of the length of the vector X in the usual sense,
namely X TX = x2 + y2 + z2. Similarly,
which is the usual scalar or inner product, here written in matrix form. The expression
AX gives a column vector with linear expressions as its elements. Using Example 5.5(b),
we can rewrite the linear equations
x + 2y
= 3
x + y
= 4
2x + y + z = 5
as
which may be written in the standard matrix form for linear equations as
AX = b
It is also important to realize that if AB = 0 it does not follow that either A or B is zero.
In Example 5.4(f) we saw that the product AC = 0, but neither A nor C is the zero
matrix.

MATLAB
If A and B have been deﬁned and have
the correct dimensions then
A * B
and
A^2
have the usual meaning of matrix 
multiplication and squaring.
For matrices involving algebraic
quantities, or when exact arithmetic is
desirable, use of the Symbolic Math
Toolbox is required; in which case the
matrices A and B must be expressed in
symbolic form using the sym command,
that is
A = sym(A); B = sym(B)
MAPLE
If A and B have been deﬁned and have
the correct dimensions then it is best
ﬁrst to invoke the linalg package
with(linalg):
multiply(A,B);
evalm(A &* B);
both produce the product of the two
matrices.
evalm(A&^2);
squares the matrix A.
Because MAPLE is a symbolic 
package all variables are assumed to be 
symbols and there is no need to declare
them to be so.
Matrix multiplication is an important part of computer packages and is easily 
implemented.

Properties of matrix multiplication
We now consider the basic properties of matrix multiplication. These may be proved
using the deﬁnition of matrix multiplication and this is left as an exercise for the reader.
(a) CommutatiVe law
Matrices do not commute in general, although they may do in special cases. In Example
5.4 we saw that AB ≠BA, and a further example illustrates the same result:
so again AB ≠BA. The products do not necessarily have the same size, as shown in
Example 5.4(a and b), where AB is a 2 × 2 matrix while BA is 3 × 3. In fact, even
if AB exists, it does not follow that BA does. Take, for example, the matrices
The product aB = [4
4] is well deﬁned but Ba
cannot be computed since a 3 × 2 matrix cannot be multiplied on the right by a 1 × 3
matrix. Thus order matters, and we need to distinguish between AB and BA. To do this,
we talk of pre-multiplication of B by A to form AB, and post-multiplication of B by
A to form BA.
(b) AssociatiVe law
It follows from the deﬁnition of the matrix product and a careful use of double sum-
mations that
A(BC) = (AB)C
where A is m × p, B is p × q and C is q × n.
Matrix multiplication is associative and we can therefore omit the brackets.
(c) DistributiVe law oVer multiplication by a scalar
(λA)B = A(λB) = λAB holds
(d) DistributiVe law oVer addition
(A + B)C = AC + BC
and
A(B + C) = AB + AC
so we can multiply out brackets in the usual way, but making sure that the order of the
products is maintained.

5.2 BASIC CONCEPTS, DEFINITIONS AND PROPERTIES

(e) Multiplication by unit matrices
If A is an m × n matrix and if Im and In are the unit matrices of orders m and n then
ImA = AIn = A
Thus pre- or post-multiplication by the appropriate unit matrix leaves A unchanged.
(f) Transpose of a product
(AB)T = BTAT
where A is an m × p matrix and B a p × n matrix. The proof follows from the deﬁnition
of matrix transpose and matrix multiplication but requires careful treatment of summa-
tion signs. Thus the transpose of the product of matrices is the product of the transposed
matrices in the reverse order.
Example 5.6
Given the matrices
(a) ﬁnd (i) AB, (ii) (AB)T and (iii) BTAT;
(b) pre-multiply each side of the equation BX = c by A.
Solution
(a) It would be a useful exercise to check these products using MATLAB or MAPLE.
(i) 
The MATLAB commands
A = [1 2 2; 0 1 1; 1 0 1];
B = [1 −2 0; 1 −1 −1; −1 2 1]; A*B
produce the correct unit matrix.

and we see that we have a solution to our set of linear equations. 
In MATLAB the solution X to the set of linear equations BX = c is determined by
the command B\c. Check that the commands
B = [1 –2 0; 1 –1 –1; –1 2 1];
c = [1;0;1];
B\c
return the given answer.

Plotting these points on the plane, as in Figure 5.4, we see that the square has been

This type of analysis forms the basis of manipulation of diagrams on a computer

and the other two results follow similarly.
(b) From part (a)
and again the other two results follow similarly.
(c) These results can be obtained directly from part (a) since AB has already been 
calculated, similarly for BC and CA.
Note: This example illustrates the use of matrices that have complex elements. Pauli
discovered that the matrices A, B and C have the properties (a), (b) and (c) required of
the components of the spin of an electron.
Example 5.10
A rectangular site is to be levelled, and the amount of earth that needs to be removed
must be determined. A survey of the site at a regular mesh of points 10m apart is made.

It is known that the approximate volume of a cell of side x and with corner heights of
a, b, c and d is
V = 
(a + b + c + d)
Write the total approximate volume in matrix form and hence estimate the volume to
be removed.
Solution
Note that for the ﬁrst row of cells the volume is
25( 0
+ 0.31
+0.31 + 0.40
+0.40 + 0.45
+0.45 + 0.51
+0.51 + 0.60
+0.12 + 0.33
+0.33 + 0.51
+0.51 + 0.58
+0.58 + 0.66
+0.66 + 0.75)
= 25[0 + 2(0.31 + 0.40 + 0.45 + 0.51) + 0.60]
+ 25[0.12 + 2(0.33 + 0.51 + 0.58 + 0.66) + 0.75]
The second and third rows of cells are dealt with in a similar manner, so that, when we
compute the total volume, we need to multiply the corner values by 1, the other side values
by 2 and the centre values by 4. In matrix form this multiplication can be performed as

This can be checked by multiplying the matrices out. The checking can be done on 
one of the symbolic manipulation packages, such as MAPLE or the Symbolic Math
Toolbox of MATLAB, by putting in general symbols for the matrix and verifying that,
after the matrix multiplications, the elements are multiplied by the stated factors. Per-
forming the calculation and multiplying by the 25 gives the total volume as 816.5m3.
A similar analysis can be applied to other situations – all that is needed is measured
heights and a matrix multiplication routine on a computer to deal with the large amount
of data that would be required. For other mesh shapes, or even irregular meshes, the
method is similar, but the multiplying vectors will need careful calculation.
Example 5.11
A contractor makes two products P1 and P2. The four components required to make 
the products are subcontracted out and each of the components is made up from three
ingredients A, B and C as follows:
Make-up cost
and proﬁt for

The cost per unit of the ingredients A, B and C are a, b and c respectively. The 
contractor makes the product P1 with 2 of component 1, 3 of component 2 and 4 of
component 4, and the make-up cost is 15; product P2 requires 1 of component 1, 1 
of component 2, 1 of component 3 and 2 of component 4, and the make-up cost is 12.
Find the cost to the contractor for P1 and P2. What is the change in costs if a increases
to (a + 1)? It is found that the 5 units of A required for component 1 can be reduced to
4. What is the effect on the costs?
Solution
The information presented can be written naturally in matrix form. Let C1, C2, C3 and
C4 be the cost the subcontractor charges the contractor for the four components, then
the cost C1 is computed as C1 = 5a + 4b + 3c + 10. This expression is the ﬁrst row of
the matrix equation

and the other three costs follow in a similar manner. Now let p1, p2 be the costs of
producing the ﬁnal products. The costs are constructed in exactly the same way as
Substituting gives
or
Thus a simple matrix formulation gives a convenient way of coding the data. If a is
increased to (a + 1) then multiplying out shows that p1 increases by 28 and p2 by 13. If
the 5 in the ﬁrst matrix is reduced to 4 then the costs will be
so p1 is reduced by 2a and p2 by a.
A similar approach can be used in more complicated, realistic situations. Storing and
processing the information is convenient, particularly in conjunction with a computer
package or spreadsheet.

and show that 2A2 = A + I.
(b) By repeated application of this result show also that for any integer n
An = αA + βI
for some α, β.
Solution
(a) The ﬁrst two results follow by applying matrix multiplication; the importance of
such results will be seen in Section 5.7 on eigenvalues. The next result follows since
and
and hence 2A2 = A + I.
(b) To show the ﬁnal result, note that multiplying by 2A gives
4A3 = 2A2 + 2A = (A + I) + 2A = 3A + I
and repeating the process, multiplying by 2A
8A4 = 6A2 + 2A = 3(A + I) + 2A = 5A + 3I
The process of multiplying by 2A and replacing 2A2 by (A + I) can be applied repeat-
edly to give the ﬁnal result.

A well-known problem concerns a mythical 
country that has three cities, A, B and C, with a
total population of 2400. At the end of each year 
it is decreed that all people must move to another
city, half to one and half to the other. If a, b and 
c are the populations in the cities A, B and C
respectively, show that in the next year the
populations are given by
Supposing that the three cities have initial
populations of 600, 800 and 1000, what are the
populations after 10 years and after a very long 
time (a package such as MATLAB is ideal for the
calculations)? (Note that this example is a version 
of a Markov chain problem. Markov chains have
applications in many areas of science and
engineering.)

Determinants
The idea of a determinant is closely related to that of a square matrix and is crucial 
to the solution of linear equations. We shall deal here mainly with 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 
determinants.
Given the square matrices
the determinant of A, denoted by det A or | A|, is given by
| A| = a11a22 −a12a21
(5.7)
For the 3 × 3 matrix B
(5.8)
This is known as the expansion of the determinant along the ﬁrst row.
The determinant of a 1 × 1 matrix, A = [a], having a single entry a is simply its entry.
Thus
| A| = a
It is important that this be distinguished from mod a which is also written as | a |.

Example 5.14
Evaluate the third-order determinant
Solution
Expanding along the ﬁrst row as in (5.8), we have
= 1[(0)(−2) −(1)(3)] −2[(−1)(−2) −(3)(3)] 
+ 4[(−1)(1) −(3)(0)]
(using (5.7))
= 1(−3) −2(−7) + 4(−1)
= 7
If we take a determinant and delete row i and column j then the determinant remaining is
called the minor Mij. In general we can take any row (or column) and evaluate an
n × n determinant | A| as
(5.9)
The fact that the determinant is the same for any i requires detailed proof. The deter-
minant in (5.8) is just the expansion (5.9) with i = 1 and n = 3 and gives the expansion
by the ﬁrst row.
The sign associated with a minor is given in the array
A minor multiplied by the appropriate sign is called the cofactor Aij of the element, so
Aij = (−1)i+jMij

5.3 DETERMINANTS
331
Example 5.15
Evaluate the minors and cofactors of the determinant
associated with the ﬁrst row, and hence evaluate the determinant.
Solution
Element a11 has minor M11 = −2 and cofactor A11 = −2.
Element a12 has minor M12 = 2 and cofactor A12 = −2.
Element a13 has minor M13 = 2 and cofactor A13 = 2. Thus the determinant is
| A| = 3 × (−2) + 4 × (−2) + 5 × 2 = −4
It may be checked that the same result is obtained by expanding along any row (or 
column), care being taken to incorporate the correct signs.
The properties of determinants are not always obvious, and are often quite difﬁcult to
prove in full generality. The commonly useful row operations are as follows.
(a) Two rows (or columns) equal
Thus if two rows (or columns) are the same, the determinant is zero.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
(b) Multiple of a row by a scalar
The proof of this result follows from the deﬁnition. A consequence of (a) and (b) is that
if any row (or column) is a multiple of another row (or column) then the determinant is
zero.
(c) Interchange of two rows (or columns)
Consider | A | and | B | in which rows 1 and 2 are interchanged
Expanding | A| by the ﬁrst row,
and | B | by the second row
Thus
| A| = −| B |
so that interchanging two rows changes the sign of the determinant. Entirely similar
results apply when changing two columns.
(d) Addition rule
Expanding by the ﬁrst row:
= (a11 + b11)A11 + (a12 + b12)A12 + (a13 + b13)A13
= (a11A11 + a12A12 + a13A13) + (b11A11 + b12A12 + b13A13)
It should be noted that | A + B| is not equal to |A| + | B | in general.

(e) Adding multiples of rows (or columns)
Consider
Then
= | A|
(since, by (a), the second determinant is zero)
This means that adding multiples of rows (or columns) together makes no difference to
the determinant.
(f) Transpose
| AT| = | A|
This just states that expanding by the ﬁrst row or the ﬁrst column gives the same result.
(g) Product
| AB | = | A|| B|
This result is difﬁcult to prove generally, but it can be veriﬁed rather tediously for the
2 × 2 or 3 × 3 cases. For the 2 × 2 case
| A|| B | = (a11a22 −a12a21)(b11b22 −b12b21)
= a11a22b11b22 −a11a22b12b21 −a12a21b11b22 + a12a21b12b21
and
= (a11b11 + a12b21)(a21b12 + a22b22) −(a11b12 + a12b22)(a21b11 + a22b21)

Example 5.16
Evaluate the 3 × 3 determinants
Solution
(a) Expand by the ﬁrst row:
(b) Expand by the ﬁrst column:
Note that (a) and (b) are the same determinant, but with two rows interchanged. The
result conﬁrms property (c) just stated above.
(c) Expand by the third row:
Note that the matrix associated with the determinant in (c) is just the transpose of the
matrix associated with the determinant in (b).
(d)
Note that we have used the multiple of a row rule on two occasions; the ﬁnal deter-
minant is the same as (a).
In MATLAB and MAPLE the determinant of a matrix A is given by the command
det(A). Considering Example 5.16(d) the MATLAB commands
A = [1 0 1; 0 2 4; 3 3 0];
det(A)
return the answer –18.

We can use properties (a)–(e) to reduce the amount of computation involved in 
evaluating a determinant. We introduce as many zeros as possible into a row or column,

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Solution
A solution using MAPLE is given by the commands
with (linalg):
E:= array ([[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1+a, 1, 1], 
[1, 1, 1+b, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1+c]]):
det(E);
Using MATLAB’s Symbolic Math Toolbox the commands
syms a b c
E = sym([1 1 1 1; 1 1+a 1 1; 1 1 1+b 1; 1 1 1 1+c]);
det(E);
pretty(ans)
return the answer abc.
A point that should be carefully noted concerns large determinants; they are extremely
difﬁcult and time-consuming to evaluate (using the basic deﬁnition (5.9) for an n × n
determinant involves n!(n −1) multiplications). This is a problem even with computers
– which in fact use alternative methods. If at all possible, evaluation of large deter-
minants should be avoided. They do, however, play a central role in matrix theory.
The cofactors A11, A12, … deﬁned earlier have the property that
| A| = a11 A11 + a12 A12 + a13 A13
Consider the expression a21A11 + a22A12 + a23A13. In determinant form we have
since two rows are identical. Similarly,
a31A11 + a32 A12 + a33 A13 = 0

A numerical example illustrates these points.
Example 5.19
Illustrate the use of cofactors in the expansion of determinants on the matrix
Solution
The cofactors are evaluated as
and continuing in the same way
A21 = 22, A22 = −20, A23 = 6, A31 = −7, A32 = 14 and A33 = −7
A selection of the evaluations in (5.10), that is expansion by rows, is
a11A11 + a12A12 + a13A13 = 1 × (−27) + 2 × 22 + 3 × 13 = 56
a21A11 + a22A12 + a23A13 = 6 × (−27) + 5 × 22 + 4 × 13 = 0
a31A21 + a32A22 + a33A23 = 7 × 22 + 8 × (−20) + 1 × 6 = 0
and in (5.11), that is expansion by columns, is
a11A12 + a21A22 + a31A32 = 1 × 22 + 6 × (−20) + 7 × 14 = 0
a12A12 + a22A22 + a32A32 = 2 × 22 + 5 × (−20) + 8 × 14 = 56
a13A11 + a23A21 + a33A31 = 3 × (−27) + 4 × 22 + 1 × (−7) = 0
The other expansions in (5.10) and (5.11) can be veriﬁed in this example. It may be
noted that the determinant of the matrix is 56.
A matrix with particularly interesting properties is the adjoint or adjugate matrix,
which is deﬁned as the transpose of the matrix of cofactors; that is,

(5.12)
If we now calculate A (adj A), we have
So
(5.13)
and we have thus discovered a matrix that when multiplied by A gives a scalar times
the unit matrix.
If A is a square matrix of order n then, taking determinants on both sides of (5.13),
| A| | adj A| = | A(adj A)| = || A| In| = | A|n
If | A| ≠0, it follows that
| adj A| = | A|n−1
(5.14)
a result known as Cauchy’s theorem.
It is also the case that
adj(AB) = (adj B)(adj A)
(5.15)
so in taking the adjoint of a product the order is reversed.
An important piece of notation that has signiﬁcant implications for the solution of
sets of linear equations concerns whether or not a matrix has zero determinant. A square
matrix A is called non-singular if | A| ≠0 and singular if | A| = 0.

Solution
The cofactors are very easy to evaluate in the 2 × 2 case: for the matrix A
A11 = 8, A12 = −2, A21 = −3
and
A22 = 1
and for the matrix B
B11 = −4, B12 = 3, B21 = −2
and
B22 = −1
The adjoint or adjugate matrices can be written down immediately as
Now (5.13) gives
so the property is satisﬁed and the determinants are 2 and 10 respectively. For (5.14)
we have n = 2, so
as required.
Evaluating the matrices in (5.15)
and
and the statement is clearly veriﬁed. It is left as an exercise to show that the product of
the matrices the other way round, adj A adj B, gives a totally different matrix.

Solution
The matrix of cofactors is
so, from (5.12)
Since | A| = 4 the last result then follows.
In MAPLE the adjoint of a matrix A is determined by the command adj(A). There
appears to be no equivalent command in either MATLAB or its Symbolic Math
Toolbox. However, the maple command in the Toolbox may be used to access the
command in MAPLE, having ﬁrst expressed the matrix A in symbolic form using
the sym command. Consequently in MATLAB’s Symbolic Math Toolbox the
adjoint is determined by the commands
A = sym(A);
adjA = maple(‘adj’, A)
Check that in MATLAB the commands
A = [1 1 2; 2 0 1; 3 1 1];
A = sym(A);
adjA = maple(‘adj’,A)
return the ﬁrst answer in Example 5.21.

5.4
The inverse matrix
In Section 5.3 we constructed adj A and saw that it had interesting properties in rela-
tion to the unit matrix. We also saw, in Example 5.6, that we had a method of solving
linear equations if we could construct B such that AB = I. These ideas can be brought
together to provide a comprehensive theory of the solution of linear equations, which
we will consider in Section 5.5.
Given a square matrix A, if we can construct a matrix B such that
BA = AB = I
then we call B the inverse of A and write it as A−1. From (5.13)
A(adj A) = | A|I

so that we have gone a long way to constructing the inverse. We have two cases:
l
If A is non-singular then | A| ≠0 and
l
If A is singular then | A| = 0 and it can be shown that the inverse A−1 does 
not exist.
If the inverse exists then it is unique. Suppose for a given A we have two inverses 
B and C. Then
AB = BA = I,
AC = CA = I
and therefore
AB = AC
Pre-multiplying by C, we have
C(AB) = C(AC)
But matrix multiplication is associative, so we can write this as
(CA)B = (CA)C
Hence
IB = IC
(since CA = I)
and so
B = C
The inverse is therefore unique.
It should be noted that if both A and B are square matrices then AB = I if and only
if BA = I.

In both cases it can be checked that AA−1 = I and BB−1 = I.
Finding the inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix is very easy, since for
Unfortunately there is no simple extension of this result to higher-order matrices. On
the other hand, in most practical situations the inverse itself is rarely required – it is 
the solution of the corresponding linear equations that is important. To understand the
power and applicability of the various methods of solution of linear equations, the 
role of the inverse is essential. The consideration of the adjoint matrix provides a 
theoretical framework for this study, but as a practical method for ﬁnding the inverse
of a matrix it is virtually useless, since, as we saw earlier, it is so time-consuming to
compute determinants.
To ﬁnd the inverse of a product of two matrices, the order is reversed:
(AB)−1 = B−1A−1
(5.16)
(provided that A and B are invertible). To prove this, let C = B−1A−1. Then
C(AB) = (B−1A−1)(AB) = B−1(A−1A)B = B−1IB = B−1B = I
and thus
C = B−1A−1 = (AB)−1
Since matrices do not commute in general A−1B−1 ≠B−1A−1.
In MATLAB the inverse of a matrix A is determined by the command inv(A); ﬁrst
expressing A in symbolic form using the sym command if the Symbolic Math
Toolbox is used. In MAPLE the corresponding command is inverse(A).

MATRIX ALGEBRA
This technique is an important one mathematically (see the companion text Advanced
Modern Engineering Mathematics) since it provides a method of uncoupling a system
of coupled equations. Practically it is the process used to reduce a physical system to
principal axes; in elasticity it provides the principal stresses in a body.
Check that in MATLAB the commands
T = [0.6 0.3 0.1; 1 1 0.5; 1.2 1.5 1];
inv(T)
return the inverse T −1 in the numeric form
Check also that, using the Symbolic Math Toolbox, the exact form given in the 
solution is obtained using the commands
T = [0.6 0.3 0.1; 1 1 0.5; 1.2 1.5 1];
T = sym(T);
inv(T)

MATRIX ALGEBRA
5.5
Linear equations
Although matrices are of great importance in themselves, their practical importance lies
in the solution of sets of linear equations. Such sets of equations occur in a wide range
of scientiﬁc and engineering problems. In the ﬁrst part of this section we shall consider
whether or not a solution exists, and then in Sections 5.5.2 and 5.5.4 we shall look at
practical methods of solution.
We now make some deﬁnitive statements about the solution of the system of simul-
taneous linear equations.
(5.17)
or, in matrix notation,
that is,
AX = b
(5.18)
where A is the matrix of coefﬁcients and X the vector of unknowns. If b = 0 the 
equations are called homogeneous, while if b ≠0 they are called nonhomogeneous
(or inhomogeneous). There are several cases to consider.
Case (a) b ≠0 and | A | ≠0
We know that A−1 exists, and hence
A−1AX = A−1b
so that
X = A−1b
(5.19)
and we have a unique solution to (5.17) and (5.18).
Case (b) b = 0 and | A | ≠0
Again A−1 exists, and the homogeneous equations
AX = 0
give

A−1AX = A−10
or
X = 0
We therefore only have the trivial solution X = 0.
Case (c) b ≠0 and | A | = 0
The inverse matrix does not exist, and this is perhaps the most complicated case. We
have two possibilities: either we have no solution or we have inﬁnitely many solutions.
A simple example will illustrate the situation. The equations
are clearly inconsistent, and no solution exists. However, in the case of
where one equation is a multiple of the other, we have inﬁnitely many solutions: x = λ,
y = 1 −
is a solution for any value of λ.
The same behaviour is observed for problems involving more than two variables, but
the situation is then much more difﬁcult to analyse. The problem of determining
whether or not a set of equations has a solution will be discussed in Section 5.6.
Case (d) b = 0 and | A | = 0
As in case (c), we have inﬁnitely many solutions. For instance, the case of two equa-
tions takes the form
px + qy = 0
αpx + αqy = 0
so that |A| = 0 and we ﬁnd a solution x = λ, y = −pλ/q if q ≠0. If q = 0 then x = 0, 
y = λ is a solution. 
This case is one of the most important, since we can deduce the important general
result that the equation
AX = 0
has a non-trivial solution if and only if | A| = 0.
Again the general result will be discussed further in Section 5.6 which looks at the
rank of a matrix.
Example 5.25
Write the ﬁve sets of equations in matrix form and decide whether they have or do not
have a solution.
(a)
2x + y = 5
(b)
2x + y = 0
(c) −3x + 6y = 15
x −2y = −5
x −2y = 0
x −2y = −5
(d) −3x + 6y = 10
(e) −3x + 6y = 0
x −2y = −5
x −2y = 0

5.5 LINEAR EQUATIONS
349

Solution
(a) In matrix form the equations are 
The determinant of the matrix 
has the value −5 and the right-hand side is non-zero, so the problem is of the type Case
(a) and hence has a unique solution, namely x = 1, y = 3.
(b) In matrix form the equations are
The determinant of the matrix  
has the value −5 and the right-hand side is now zero, so the problem is of the type Case
(b) and hence only has the trivial solution, namely x = 0, y = 0.
(c) In matrix form the equations are 
The determinant of the matrix
matrix is now zero and the right-hand side is non-zero, so the problem is of the type
Case (c) and hence the solution is not so easy. Essentially the ﬁrst equation is just (−3)
times the second equation, so a solution can be computed. A bit of rearrangement soon
gives x = 2t −5, y = t for any t, and thus there are inﬁnitely many solutions to this set
of equations.
(d) In matrix form the equations are 
The determinant of the matrix 
is zero again and the right-hand side is non-zero, so the problem is once more of the type
Case (c) and hence the solution is not so easy. The left-hand side of the ﬁrst equation
is (−3) times the second equation but the right-hand side is only (−2) times the second
equation, so the equations are inconsistent and there is no solution to this set of equations.
(e) In matrix form the equations are 
The determinant of the matrix 
is zero again and the right-hand side is also zero, so the problem is of the type Case (d)
and hence a non-trivial solution can be found. It can be seen that x = 2s and y = s gives
the solution for any s.

Find a solution of
x + y + z = 6
x + 2y + 3z = 14
x + 4y + 9z = 36

MATRIX ALGEBRA

we have
so that a solution does exist and is unique. The inverse of A can be computed as
and hence, from (5.19),
so the solution is x = 1, y = 2 and z = 3.
Example 5.27
Find the values of k for which the equations
x + 5y + 3z = 0
5x + y −kz = 0
x + 2y + kz = 0
have a non-trivial solution.
Solution
The matrix of coefﬁcients is
For a non-zero solution, | A| = 0. Hence
Thus the equations have a non-trivial solution if k = 1; if k ≠1, the only solution is 
x = y = z = 0. For k = 1 a simple calculation gives x = λ, y = −2λ and z = 3λ for any λ.

Solution
We require
= −3λ + λ2 + 2 = (λ −2)(λ −1)
Non-trivial solutions occur only if λ = 1 or 2.
If λ = 1,
If λ = 2,
(Note: The problem described here is an important one. The λ and X are called eigen-
values and eigenvectors, which are introduced in Section 5.7.)
It is possible to write down the solution of a set of equations explicitly in terms of the
cofactors of a matrix. However, as a method for computing the solution, this is
extremely inefﬁcient; a set of ten equations, for example, will require 4 × 108 multi-
plications – which takes a long time even on modern computers. The method is of 
great theoretical interest though. Consider the set of equations
(5.20)
Denoting the matrix of coefﬁcients by A and recalling the deﬁnitions of the cofactors
in Section 5.3, we multiply the equations by A11, A21 and A31 respectively and add 
to give
(a11A11 + a21A21 + a31A31)x1 + (a12A11 + a22A21 + a32A31)x2
+ (a13A11 + a23A21 + a33A31)x3

5.5 LINEAR EQUATIONS

Using (5.11), we obtain
| A|x1 + 0x2 + 0x3 = b1A11 + b2A21 + b3A31
The right-hand side can be written as a determinant, so
The other xi follow similarly, and we derive Cramer’s rule that a solution of (5.20) is
provided | A | ≠0. Again it should be stressed that this rule should not be used as a com-
putational method because of the large effort required to evaluate determinants.
Example 5.29
A function u(x, y) is known to take values u1, u2 and u3 at the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and
(x3, y3) respectively. Find the linear interpolating function 
u = a + bx + cy
within the triangle having its vertices at these three points.
Solution
To ﬁt the data to the linear interpolating function
u1 = a + bx1 + cy1
u2 = a + bx2 + cy2
or in matrix form
u3 = a + bx3 + cy3
The values of a, b and c can be obtained from Cramer’s rule as

MATRIX ALGEBRA
where A is the matrix of coefﬁcients. The interpolation formula is now known. In ﬁnite-
element analysis the evaluation of interpolation functions, such as the one described, is
of great importance. Finite elements are central to many large-scale calculations in all
branches of engineering; an introduction is given in Chapter 9 of the companion text
Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.
Example 5.30
Solve the matrix equation AX = c where
Solution
The solution of such a problem is beyond the scope of hand computation; Cramer’s
rule, evaluation of the adjoint and direct evaluation of the inverse are all impracticable.
Even the more practical methods in the next sections struggle with this size of problem 
if hand computation is tried. A computer package must be used. In MATLAB the 
relevant instructions are given.
b = zeros (10, 10);
for i = 1 : 9, b (i, i) = 4; b (i, i + 1) = 1; b (i + 1, 1)
= 1; end
b (10, 10) = 4;
c = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1];

simultaneous equations
x + 2y = 4
2x + y = 5
Subtract 2 × (equation 1) from (equation 2) to give
x + 2y = 4
−3y = −3
Divide the second equation by −3
x + 2y = 4
y = 1
From the second of these equations y = 1 and substituting into the ﬁrst equation gives
x = 2.
This example illustrates the basic technique for the solution of a set of linear equa-
tions by Gaussian elimination, which is very straightforward in principle. However, it
needs considerable care to ensure that the calculations are carried out efﬁciently. Given
n linear equations in the variables x1, x2, … , xn, we solve in a series of steps:
(1)
We solve the ﬁrst equation for x1 in terms of x2, … , xn, and eliminate x1 from
the remaining equations.
(2)
We then solve the second equation of the remaining set for x2 in terms of 
x3, … , xn and eliminate x2 from the remaining equations.
(3)
We repeat the process in turn on x3, x4, … until we arrive at a ﬁnal equation for
xn, which we can then solve.
(4)
We substitute back to get in turn xn−1, xn−2, … , x1.
For a small number of variables, say two, three or four, the method is easy to apply and
efﬁciency is not of the highest priority. In most science and engineering problems we
are normally dealing with a large number of variables – a simple stability analysis of

a vibrating system can lead to seven or eight variables, and a plate-bending problem
could easily give rise to several hundred variables.
As a further example of the basic technique, we solve
x1 + x2
= 3
(5.21)
2x1 + x2 + x3 = 7
(5.22)
x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 = 14
(5.23)
First, we eliminate x1:
(5.21) gives
x1 = 3 −x2
(5.21′)
(5.22) gives
2(3 −x2) + x2 + x3 = 7,
or
−x2 + x3 = 1
(5.22′)
(5.23) gives
(3 −x2) + 2x2 + 3x3 = 14,
or
x2 + 3x3 = 11
(5.23′)
Secondly we eliminate x2:
(5.22′) gives
x2 = x3 −1
(5.22″)
(5.23′) gives
(x3 −1) + 3x3 = 11,
or
4x3 = 12
(5.23″)
Equation (5.23″) gives x3 = 3; we put this into (5.22″) to obtain x2 = 2; we then put this
into (5.21′) to obtain x1 = 1. Thus the values x1 = 1, x2 = 2 and x3 = 3 give a solution to
the original problem.
Equations (5.21)–(5.23) in matrix form become
The elimination procedure has reduced the equations to (5.21), (5.22′) and (5.23″),
which in matrix form become
Essentially the elimination has brought the equations to upper-triangular form (that
is, a form in which the matrix of coefﬁcients has zeros in every position below the 
diagonal), which are then very easy to solve.
Elimination procedures rely on the manipulation of equations or, equivalently, the
rows of the matrix equation. There are various elementary row operations used which
do not alter the solution of the equations:
(a)
multiply a row by a constant;
(b)
interchange any two rows;
(c)
add or subtract one row from another.
To illustrate these, we take the matrix equation
which has the solution x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 3.

Multiplying the ﬁrst row by 2 (a row operation of type (a)) yields
Interchanging rows 1 and 3 (a row operation of type (b)) yields
Subtracting row 1 from row 2 (a row operation of type (c)) yields
In each case we see that the solution of the modiﬁed equations is still x1 = 1, x2 = 2,
x3 = 3.
Elimination procedures use repeated applications of (a), (b) and (c) in some system-
atic manner until the equations are processed into a required form such as the upper-
triangular equations
(5.24)
The solution of the equations in upper-triangular form can be written as
xn = bn/ann
xn−1 = (bn−1 −an−1,nxn)/an−1, n−1
xn−2 = (bn−2 −an−2,nxn −an−2, n−1xn−1)/an−2, n−2
\
x1 = (b1 −a1nxn −a1, n−1xn−1 − … −a12x2)/a11
A MATLAB function procedure implementing these equations is shown in Figure 5.8. 
The elementary row operations and the elimination technique are illustrated in 
Example 5.31.

Example 5.31
Use elementary row operations and elimination to solve the set of linear equations
x + 2y + 3z = 10
−x + y + z = 0
y −z = 1
Solution
In matrix form the equations are
Add row 1 to row 2:
Divide row 2 by 3:
Subtract row 2 from row 3:
Divide row 3 by (
):
The equations are now in a standard upper-triangular form for the application of the
back substitution procedure described formally in Figure 5.8.

It remains to undertake the operations in the example in a routine and logical manner
to make the method into one of the most powerful techniques, called elimination 
methods, available for the solution of sets of linear equations. The method is available
on all computer packages. Such packages are excellent at undertaking the rather tedious
arithmetic and some will even illustrate the computational detail also. They are well
worth mastering. However, writing and checking your own procedures, implementing
the MATLAB code in Figure 5.8 for instance, is a powerful learning tool and gives
great understanding of the method, the difﬁculties and errors involved in a method.
Tridiagonal or Thomas algorithm
Because of the ease of solution of upper-triangular systems, many methods use the 
general strategy of reducing the equations to this form. As an example of this strategy,
we shall look at a tridiagonal system, which takes the form
(5.25)
or
a1x1 + b1x2
= d1
c2x1 + a2x2 + b2x3
= d2
c3x2 + a3x3 + b3x4
= d3

First we eliminate x1:
x1 + b′1x2
= d′1
a′2x2 + b2x3
= d′2

= d3

where
a′2 = a2 −c2b′1
and
d′2 = d2 −c2d′1
Next we eliminate x2:
x1 + b′1x2
= d′1
x2 + b″2x3
= d″2
a″3x3 + b3x4
= d″3
c4x3 + a4x4 + b4x5
= d4
and so on
where
a″3 = a3 −c3b″2
and
d″3 = d3 −c3d″2
We can proceed to eliminate all the variables down to the nth. We have then converted
the problem to an upper-triangular form, which can be solved by the procedure in
Figure 5.8. A MATLAB function to solve (5.25) called the tridiagonal or Thomas
algorithm is shown in Figure 5.9. The algorithm is written so that each primed value,
when it is computed, replaces the previous value. Similarly the double-primed values
replace the primed values. This is called overwriting, and reduces the storage required to
implement the algorithm on a computer. It should be noted, however, that the algorithm
is written for clarity and not minimum storage or maximum efﬁciency. The algorithm is
very widely used; it is exceptionally fast and requires very little storage. Again writing
your own code based on Figure 5.9 can greatly enhance the understanding of the method.

5.5 LINEAR EQUATIONS

Solution
The sequence of matrices is given by
The elimination stage is now complete, and we substitute back to give
t = −2, z =
−
t = 2, y =
−
z = −1
and
x =
−
y = 1
so that the complete solution is x = 1, y = −1, z = 2, t = −2.
Although the Thomas algorithm is efﬁcient, the procedure in Figure 5.9 is not fool-
proof, as illustrated by the simple example
After the ﬁrst step we have
The next step divides by the diagonal element a22. Since this element is zero, the
method crashes to a halt. There is a perfectly good solution, however, since simply
interchanging the last two rows,
gives an upper-triangular matrix with the obvious solution z = 1, y = 2, x = 3. It is clear
that checks must be put into the algorithm to prevent such failures.
Gaussian elimination
Since most matrix equations are not tridiagonal, we should like to extend the idea to a
general matrix

MATRIX ALGEBRA
(5.26)
The result of doing this is a method known as Gaussian elimination. It is a little more
involved than the Thomas algorithm. First we eliminate x1:
where
a′22 = a22 −a21a′12,
a′23 = a23 −a21a′13,
… ,
b′2 = b2 −a21b′1
a′32 = a32 −a31a′12,
a′33 = a33 −a31a′13,
… ,
b′3 = b3 −a31b′1
and so on.
Generally these can be written as
We now operate in an identical manner on the (n −1) × (n −1) submatrix, formed by
ignoring row 1 and column 1, and repeat the process until the equations are of upper-
triangular form. At the general step in the algorithm the equations will take the form

5.5 LINEAR EQUATIONS
365
Again overwriting avoids the need for introducing primed symbols; the algorithm is
shown in Figure 5.10.
The procedure is written for a general m × n matrix. To solve the matrix equation
AX = b, where A is a non-singular square n × n matrix, append b to A and then use the
function ﬁles elim and uppertrisolve
B = [A,b]
C = elim (n,n+1, B)
z = uppertrisolve (C(:,[1:n]), C(:,n+1),n)
Although packages give the solution very efﬁciently, for instance X = A\ b, the 
MATLAB procedures in Figures 5.9 and 5.10, together with these few lines of code,
provide an opportunity to look at the intermediate results which can greatly enhance the
understanding of the method.
This algorithm, sharing the merits of the Thomas algorithm, is very widely used by
engineers to solve linear equations.
Example 5.33
Using elimination and back substitution, solve the equations

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Divide second row by

Subtract
× (row 2) from row 3:
Divide row 3 by (−2):
The elimination procedure is now complete and the back substitution (from Figure 5.8)
is applied to the upper-triangular matrix.
From the third row
z =
From the second row
y = 1 −2z = 0
From the ﬁrst row
x =

y −2z =
so the solution is x =

Example 5.34
Solve
Solution
The elimination sequence is
and application of the upper-triangular procedure gives t = −1, z = 1, y = 1 and x = 1.
It is clear again that if, in the algorithm shown in Figure 5.10, A(i, i) is zero at 
any time, the method will fail. It is, in fact, also found to be beneﬁcial to the stability
of the method to have A(i, i) as large as possible. Thus in (5.27) it is usual to 
perform a ‘partial pivoting’ so that the largest value in the column,
| A(p, i)|, is  
chosen and the equations are swapped around to make this element the pivot. In 
Figure 5.11 partial pivoting is included in the elim procedure:

In practical computer implementations of the algorithm the elements of the rows would
not be swapped explicitly. Instead, a pointer system would be used to implement a 
technique known as indirect addressing, which allows much faster computations. The
interested reader is referred to texts on computer programming techniques for a full
explanation of this method.
In a hand-computation version of this elimination procedure there are methods
that maintain running checks and minimize the amount of writing. In this book the
emphasis is on a computer implementation, and the hand computations are provided to
illustrate the principle of the method. It is a powerful learning technique to write your
own programs, but the practising professional engineer will normally use procedures
from a computer software library, where these are available.
In MATLAB the instruction [L, U] = lu(A) provides in U the eliminated matrix.
The method used in MATLAB always uses partial pivoting. The instruction A\b will
give the solution for a square matrix in one step. The MAPLE package can deal with
any size matrix, so the right-hand side of the matrix equation should be appended 
to A and hence included in the elimination, and the instruction gausselim(A); 
provides the elimination. The instruction gaussjord(A); uses a much more subtle
elimination process – see any advanced textbook on numerical linear algebra – and
gives the solution in the most convenient form. The instruction backsub(B) is also
available for the back substitution. The instruction linsolve(A,b); gives the
solution in one step.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Solution
The sequence is as follows. We ﬁrst interchange rows 1 and 2 and eliminate:
We then interchange rows 2 and 3 and eliminate:
There is no need to interchange rows at this stage, and the elimination proceeds 
immediately:
Back substitution now gives t = 0, z = 1, y = 0 and x = 1.
Ill-conditioning
Elimination methods are not without their difﬁculties, and the following example will

5.5 LINEAR EQUATIONS
369
In Example 5.36 simple equations that have only marginally different coefﬁcients
have wildly different solutions. This situation is likely to cause problems, so it must be
analysed carefully. To do so in full detail is not appropriate here, but the problem is
clearly connected with taking differences of numbers that are almost equal: 0.5001 −
0.5 = 0.0001.
Systems of equations that exhibit such awkward behaviour are called ill-conditioned.
It is not straightforward to identify ill-conditioning in matrices involving many vari-
ables, but an example will illustrate the difﬁculties in the two-variable case. Suppose
we solve
2x +
y = 0.3
x −αy = 0
where α = 1 ± 0.05 has some error in its value. We easily obtain x = 0.3α/(1 + 2α) and
y = 0.3/(1 + 2α), and putting in the range of α values we get 0.0983  x  0.1016 and
0.0968  y  0.1034. Thus an error of ±5% in the value of α produces an error of ±2%
in x and an error of ±3% in y.
If we now try to solve
2x +
y = 0.3
x + αy = 0.3
where α = 0.4 ± 0.05, then we get the solution x = 0.3(1 −α)/(1 −2α), y = −0.3/(1 −
2α). Putting in the range of α values now gives 0.65  x  1.65 and −3  y  −1, and
an error of ±12% in the value of α produces errors in x and y of up to 100%.
Figure 5.12 illustrates these equations geometrically. We see that a small change in
the slope of the line x −αy = 0 makes only a small difference in the solution. However,
changing the slope of the line x + αy = 0.3 makes a large difference, because the lines
are nearly parallel. Identifying such behaviour for higher-dimensional problems is not
at all easy. Sets of equations of this kind do occur in engineering contexts, so the
difﬁculties outlined here should be appreciated. In each of the ill-conditioned cases 
we have studied, the determinant of the system is ‘small’:
= −0.2 ± 0.1
Thus the equations are ‘nearly singular’ – and this is one means of identifying the prob-
lem. However, the reader should refer to a more advanced book on numerical analysis
to see how to identify and deal with ill-conditioning in the general case.

Most of these exercises will require MATLAB or MAPLE for their solution. To appreciate the elimination
method, hand computation should be tried on the ﬁrst few exercises.

A matrix that has zeros in every position below 
the diagonal is called an upper-triangular matrix
and one with zeros everywhere above the diagonal
is called a lower-triangular matrix. A matrix that
only has non-zero elements in certain diagonal lines
is called a banded matrix. In this case we have
shown that a tridiagonal matrix can be written as the
product of a lower-triangular banded matrix and an
upper-triangular banded matrix.

A wire is loaded with equal weights W at 
nine uniformly spaced points, as illustrated in 
Figure 5.13. The wire is sufﬁciently taut that 
the tension T may be considered to be constant. 
The end points are at the same level, so that 
u0 = u10 = 0 and the system is symmetrical about 
its midpoint. The equations to determine the
displacements ui are 
W = (T/d)(2u1 −
u2
)
W = (T/d)(−u1 + 2u2 −
u3
)
W = (T/d)(
−u2 + 2u3 −
u4
)
W = (T/d)(
−u3 + 2u4 −u5)
W = (T/d)(
−2u4 + 2u5)
Taking Wd/T = l, calculate ui/l for i = 1, … , 5.

The solution of linear equations: iterative methods
An alternative and very popular way of solving linear equations is by iteration. This 
has the attraction of being easy to program. In practice, the availability of efﬁcient 
procedures in computer libraries means that elimination methods are usually preferred
for small problems. However, when the number of variables gets large, say several
hundred, elimination methods struggle because the matrices can contain 106 or more
elements. Problems of such size commonly occur in those scientiﬁc and engineering
computations that require numerical solution on a mesh. Typically, in a turbine ﬂow,
we have a three-dimensional ﬂuid ﬂow problem that would need to be solved for three
velocities and pressure on a 30 × 30 × 30 mesh. The problem would require the solu-
tion of a 27 000 × 27 000 matrix equation. The saving feature of such problems is that
it is very common for almost all the entries in the matrix to be zero. Matrices in which
the large majority of elements are zero are called sparse matrices. Unless there is 
special structure to the equations, elimination will quickly destroy the sparseness. On
the other hand, iterative methods only have to deal with the non-zero terms, so there 
is considerable computational saving. As usual, there is a price to pay:
(a)
it is not always easy to decide when the method has converged;
(b)
if the method takes a very large number of iterations to converge, any savings
are quickly consumed.
A simple example will illustrate the way the method proceeds; in this example exact
fractions will be used.
To solve the equations
4x + y = 2
x + 4y = −7
we ﬁrst rearrange them as
x =
(2 −y)
y =
(−7 −x)
and start with x = 0, y = 0.
Putting these values into the right-hand side gives
x =
,
y = −
Putting these new values into the right-hand side gives
x =
, y = −
Putting these new values into the right-hand side gives
x =
, y = −
Putting these new values into the right-hand side gives
x =
, y = −
Putting these new values into the right-hand side gives
x =
, y = −
Performing the same procedure repeatedly, normally called iteration, gives a set of
numbers that appear to be tending to the solution x = 1, y = −2.
This particular example shows the strength of the method but we are not always so
fortunate, as illustrated in the next example.

5.5 LINEAR EQUATIONS

Consider the tridiagonal equations in Example 5.32:
2x + y
= 1
x + 2y + z
= 1
y + 2z + t = 1
z + 2t = −2
We can rearrange these as
(5.28)
Suppose we start with x = y = z = t = 0. We substitute these into the right-hand side and
evaluate the new x, y, z and t; we then substitute the new values back in and repeat the
process. Such iteration gives the results shown in Figure 5.14. This shows values going
depressingly slowly to the solution 1, −1, 2, −2: even after 20 iterations the values are
0.9381, −0.9767, 1.9727, −1.9856. The method just described is called the Jacobi
method, and can be written, using superscripts as iteration counters, in the form
x(r+1) =
(1 −y(r))
y(r+1) =
(1 −x(r) −z(r))
z(r+1) =
(1 −y(r) −t(r))
t(r+1) =
(−2 −z(r))
An obvious step is to use the new values as soon as they are available. In the two-
variable example the same equations
x =
(2 −y)
y =
(−7 −x)

are used and the same starting point x = 0, y = 0 is used. The iteration proceeds slightly
differently:
Put the values 0, 0 in the ﬁrst equation
⇒x =

⇒y =
Put the values
,  
in the ﬁrst equation
⇒x =
Put the values
, 
in the second equation
⇒y =

,  
in the ﬁrst equation
⇒x =
and continue in the same way. It can be seen that already the convergence is very much
faster.
In the second example we use the new values of x, y, z and t as soon as they are 
calculated: the method is called Gauss–Seidel iteration. This can be written as
x(r+1) =
(1 −y(r))
y(r+1) =
(1 −x(r+1) −z(r))
z(r+1) =
(1 −y(r+1) −t(r))
t(r+1) =
(−2 −z(r+1))
The calculation now yields the results shown in Figure 5.15. We see that, after the ten
iterations quoted, the solution obtained by Gauss–Seidel iteration is within 4% of the
actual solution whereas that obtained by Jacobi iteration still has an error of about 20%.
The Gauss–Seidel method is both faster and more convenient for computer imple-
mentation. Within 20 iterations the Gauss–Seidel solution is accurate to three decimal
places.
Although the two iteration methods have been described in terms of a particular
example, the method is quite general. To solve
AX = b
we rewrite
A = D + L + U
where D is diagonal, L only has non-zero elements below the diagonal and U only has
non-zero elements above the diagonal, so that

The Jacobi method is written in this notation as
DX(r+1) = −(L + U)X(r) + b
and the Gauss–Seidel method as
DX(r+1) = −LX(r+1) −UX(r) + b
(Remember that X(r) denotes the rth iteration of X, not X raised to the power r.)
By changing the method slightly, we have been able to speed up the method, so it 
is natural to ask if it can be speeded up even further. A popular method for doing this
is successive over-relaxation (SOR). This anticipates what the xi values might be 
and overshoots the values obtained by Gauss–Seidel iteration. The new value of each
component of the vector X(r+1) is taken to be
wx i
(r+1) + (1 −w)x i
(r)
(5.29)
which is the weighted average of the previous value and the new value given by
Gauss–Seidel iteration. In the two-variable example the weighted average rearranges
the equations as
x = w[ (2 −y)] + (1 −w)x = x + w[ (2 −y −4x)]
y = w[ (−7 −x)] + (1 −w)y = y + w[ (−7 −x −4y)]
The convergence for this example is so rapid that the enhanced convergence of 
SOR is hardly worth the effort; an optimum value of w = 1.05 reduces the con-
vergence, to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures, from seven to six iterations. However, for most
problems the improved convergence is signiﬁcant. Note that w = 1 gives the Gauss–
Seidel method.
If we repeat the calculation for (5.28) including (5.29) with w = 1.2, we obtain the
results shown in Figure 5.16, together with a comparison of the other two methods. It
may be noted that the iterations converge even faster than the two previous methods,
with a solution accurate to about 0.1% after ten steps. The optimum value of w is of

MATRIX ALGEBRA
great interest, and specialist books on numerical analysis give details of how this can
be computed (for example, Applied Linear Algebra, Peter Olver and Cheri Shakiban
(2005), Pearson). Usually the best approach is a heuristic one – experiment with w to
ﬁnd a value that gives the fastest convergence. For ‘one-off’ problems this is hardly
worth the effort so long as convergence is achieved, but in many scientiﬁc and engin-
eering problems the same calculation may be done many hundreds of times, so the opti-
mum value of w can reduce calculation time by half or more. For the current problem
the number of iterations required to give four-decimal-place accuracy is shown in
Figure 5.17.
It can be shown that outside the region 0  w  2 the method will diverge but that
inside it may or may not converge. The case w  1 is called under-relaxation and 
w  1 is called over-relaxation. In straightforward problems, w in the range 1.2–1.8
usually gives the most rapid convergence, and this is normally the region to explore 
as a ﬁrst guess. In the problem studied, a value of w = 1.4 gives just about the fastest
convergence, requiring only about two-thirds of the iterations required for the Gauss–
Seidel method. In some physical problems, however, under-relaxation is required in
order to avoid too rapid variation from iteration to iteration.
Great care must be taken with iterative methods, and convergence for some equa-
tions can be particularly difﬁcult. Considerable experience is needed in looking at sets
of equations to decide whether or not convergence can be expected, and often – even
for the experienced mathematician – the answer is ‘try it and see’. A rearrangement of
equations can greatly affect the convergence of iterative methods. For instance, in the
2 × 2 example, if the equations are interchanged

Xold=X; XX=X; 
for i=1:20

x + 4y = −7 
and the Jacobi iteration is written
x(r+1) = −7 −4y(r)
4x + y = 2
y(r+1) = 2 −x(r)
the iteration diverges wildly even from a starting value x = 1.1, y = −2.1, which is close
to the exact solution. One simple test that will guarantee convergence is to test whether
the matrix is diagonally dominant. This means that the magnitude of a diagonal ele-
ment is larger than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the off-diagonal elements
in that row, or 
for each i. If the system is not diagonally dominant, the 
iteration method may or may not converge.
A detailed analysis of the convergence of iterative methods is not possible without
a study of eigenvalues, and can be found in specialist numerical analysis books.
Iterative methods described in this section are fairly easy to program and an imple-
mentation in MATLAB, or similar package, is highly suitable, as in Figure 5.16.

MATRIX ALGEBRA

Rank
The solution of sets of linear equations has been considered in Section 5.5. Provided the
determinant of a matrix is non-zero, we can obtain explicit solutions in terms of the
inverse matrix. However, when we looked at cases with zero determinant the results
were much less clear. The idea of the rank of a matrix helps to make these results 
more precise. Unfortunately, rank is not an easy concept, and it is usually difﬁcult to
compute. We shall take an informal approach that is not fully general but is sufﬁcient
to deal with the cases (c) and (d) of Section 5.5. The method we shall use is to take the
Gaussian elimination procedure described in Figure 5.11 (Section 5.5.2) and examine
the consequences for a zero-determinant situation.
If we start with the equations
(5.30)
and proceed with the elimination, the ﬁrst and second steps are quite normal:
The next step in the elimination procedure looks for a non-zero entry in the third 
column on or below the diagonal element. All the entries are zero – so the procedure,
as it stands, fails. To overcome the problem, we just proceed to the next column and
repeat the normal sequence of operations. We interchange the third and fourth rows and
perform the elimination on column 4. Finally we interchange rows 4 and 5 to give

To perform the back substitution we put x6 = µ. Then
row 4
gives
x5 = −3x6 = −3µ
row 3
gives
x4 = 1 + x5 + 3x6 = 1
put
x3 = λ
row 2
gives
x2 = 1 −x3 −x5 −2x6 = 1 −λ + µ
row 1
gives
x1 = 1 −x3 −x4 = −λ
Thus our solution is
x1 = −λ,
x2 = 1 −λ + µ,
x3 = λ,
x4 = 1,
x5 = −3µ,
x6 = µ
The equations have been reduced to echelon form, and it is clear that the same process
can be followed for any matrix.
In general we use the elementary row operations, introduced in Section 5.5.2, to
manipulate the equation or matrix to echelon form:
Below the line all the entries are zero, and the leading element, marked ×, in each row
above the line is non-zero. The row operations do not change the solution to the set of
equations corresponding to the matrix.
When this procedure is applied to a non-singular matrix, the method reduces to that
shown in Figure 5.10, the ﬁnal matrix has non-zero diagonal elements, and back sub-
stitution gives a unique solution. When the determinant is zero, as in (5.30), the elimina-
tion gives a matrix with some zeros in the diagonal and some zero rows, as in (5.31).
The number of non-zero rows in the echelon form is called the rank of the matrix, 
rank A; in the case of the matrix in (5.30) and that derived from it by row manipulation
(5.31), we have rank A = 4.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Solution
Using the usual elimination method gives in each case

(b)
(c)
The more common deﬁnition of rank is given by the order of the largest square sub-
matrix with non-zero determinant. A square submatrix is formed by deleting rows and
columns to form a square matrix. In (5.30) the 6 × 6 determinant is zero and all the 
5 × 5 submatrices have zero determinant; however, if we delete columns 3 and 6 and
rows 3 and 4, we obtain
which has determinant equal to one, hence conﬁrming that the matrix is of rank 4. To
show equivalence of the two deﬁnitions is not straightforward and is omitted here. To
determine the rank of a matrix, it is very much easier to look at the echelon form.
If we ﬁnd any of the rows of the echelon matrix to be zero then, for consistency, the
corresponding right-hand sides of the matrix equation must also be zero. The elementary
row operations reduce the equation to echelon form, so that the equations take the form

where u is a vector with m elements and v is a vector with (n −m) elements. Note that
each of the m non-zero rows will have a leading non-zero entry of 1 but this entry will
not necessarily be on a diagonal, as illustrated for example in (5.31). Three statements
follow from this reduction.
(i)
The matrix has rank (A) = m.
(ii)
If x ≠0 then the equations are inconsistent.
(iii)
If v = 0 then the equations are consistent and have a solution. In addition the
solution has (n −m) free parameters.
For rows 1, 2, . . . , m the leading term 1 occurs in columns c1, c2, . . . , cm and hence the
variables xc1, xc2, . . . , xcm can be calculated in terms of the RHS and the other (n −m)
variables, which can be speciﬁed arbitrarily. Thus the solution has (n −m) free param-
eters and establishes result (iii).
Writing the equations as
AX = b
(5.32)
we deﬁne the augmented matrix (A: b) as the matrix A with the b column added to it.
When reduced to echelon form the matrix and the augmented matrix take the form 
and the solution of the equations can be written in terms of rank. It is easy to see from
the echelon form that A and (A: b) must have the same rank to ensure consistency. The
original equations must have the same property, so we can state the results (c) and (d)
of Section 5.5 more clearly in terms of rank.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
If A and the augmented matrix (A: b) have different rank then we have  
no solution to the equations (5.32). If the two matrices have the same rank
then a solution exists, and furthermore the solution will contain a number
of free parameters equal to n −rank A.
The calculation of rank is not easy, so, while the result is rigorous, it is not simple
to apply. Reducing equations to echelon form tells us immediately the rank of the asso-
ciated matrix, and gives a constructive method of solution. There is a large amount of
arithmetic in the reduction, but if the solution is required then this is inevitable anyway.
The numerical calculation of rank does not normally entail reduction to echelon form;
rather more advanced methods such as singular value decomposition are used.
The instruction rank(A) evaluates the rank of an m × n matrix A in both
MATLAB and MAPLE.
Example 5.38
Reduce the following equations to echelon form, calculate the rank of the matrices and
ﬁnd the solutions of the equations (if they exist):

Eliminate elements in column 2:
Interchange row 3 and row 4:
The rank of the matrix is 3 while that of the augmented matrix (A : b) is 4, so the 
equations represented by the matrix equation (a) are not consistent. Note that the last
row cannot be satisﬁed and hence the equations have no solution.
(b) Interchanging the ﬁrst and last rows, making the pivot 1 and performing the ﬁrst
elimination, we obtain 
The matrix and the augmented matrix both have rank 2, so the equations are consistent
and we can compute the solution:
x1 = 1 −λ,
x2 = λ,
x3 = 1 −λ + µ −v,
x4 = µ,
x5 = v
As expected, the solution contains three free parameters, since the order of the equation
is 5 and the rank is 2.
In most practical problems that reduce to the solution of linear equations, it is usual
that there are n independent variables to be computed from n equations. This is not
always the case and the resulting matrix form is not square. A geometrical example 
of four equations and three unknowns was described in equation (5.1). The idea of 
a determinant is only sensible if matrices are square, so the simple results about the 
solution of the equations cannot be used. However, the ideas of elementary row oper-
ations, reduction to echelon form and rank still hold and the existence or non-existence
of solutions can be written in terms of these concepts. Some examples will illustrate the
possible situations that can occur.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Underspeciﬁed sets of equations
Here there are more variables than equations.
Case (a)
Subtract row 1 from row 2:
The elimination is now complete and the back substitution starts:
Put z = t
From row 2
y = 1 −2t
From row 1
x = 1 −y −z = t
so the full solution is
x = t,
y = 1 −2t,
z = t
for any t. Note that rank (A) = rank (A : b) = 2 and n = 3 so the solution has one free
parameter.
Case (b)
Subtract 2 × (row 1) from row 2:
and it is clear that rank (A) = 1 and rank (A : b) = 2 so there is no solution. Obviously
the last row is inconsistent. Although this example may be seen to be almost trivial
since the equations are obviously inconsistent [x + y + z = 1 and 2(x + y + z) = 1], in
larger systems the situation is hardly ever obvious.
Overspeciﬁed sets of equations

Case (c)
Subtract row 1 from rows 2 and 3:
Subtract 2 × (row 2) from row 3:
It can be observed that rank (A) = rank (A : b) = 2 and that the equations are consistent
since the last row contains all zeros. Since n = 2 a unique solution is obtained as 
x = −2 and y = 1 using back substitution.
However, for overspeciﬁed equations the more common situation is that no solution
is possible.
Case (d)
Subtract row 1 from rows 2 and 3:
Subtract 2 × (row 2) from row 3:
The equations are now clearly inconsistent since the last row says 0 = −4 and rank
(A) = 2, rank (A : b) = 3 conﬁrms this observation.
The existence or non-existence of solutions can be deduced from the echelon form
and hence the idea of rank, and we can understand the solution of matrix equations
involving non-square matrices. If A is a p × q matrix and b a p × 1 column vector, the
matrix equation AX = b represents p linear equations in q variables. The rank of a
matrix, being the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form of the matrix, cannot
exceed p. On the other hand, the row reduction process will produce an echelon form
with at most q non-zero rows. Hence the rank of a p × q matrix cannot exceed the
smaller of p and q. Figure 5.19 summarizes the results.

Notes:
(i)
In Section 5.5 the existence of solutions for p equations in p unknowns was stated in Cases (a) to (d). These results are
clariﬁed in the table. In particular, it establishes the very important result that AX = 0 has a non-trivial solution if and
only if det(A) = 0.
(ii)
The MAPLE instruction linsolve(A,b) produces a null reply if no solution exists and gives a solution with
the r free parameters when appropriate. MATLAB requires the use of pinv and null instructions to obtain the
full r free parameter solution; there is no single instruction for the task.
(iii) An alternative view of linear dependence/independence can be extracted from the table for the case b = 0. Recall from
Section 5.2.2 and Example 5.3 that the vectors a1, a2, . . . , aq of order p × 1 are linearly dependent/independent if the
equation
α1a1 + α2a2 + . . . +αqaq = 0
has a non-zero/zero solution for α1, α2, . . . , αq. Write the vectors as the columns of a p × q matrix and the coefﬁcients
as a q × 1 column vector
A = [a1, a2, . . . , aq] and XT = [α1, α2, . . . , αq]
We are therefore looking for a solution of the matrix equation
AX = 0
Since rank(A : 0) = rank(A), reading from the last two columns of the table:
(a) if r = q −rank(A) > 0 then X ≠0 exists, so the vectors are linearly dependent;
(b) if r = q −rank(A) = 0 with p > q then X = 0 is the only solution and the vectors are linearly independent.
(iv) From (iii) (a) any (p + 1) vectors of order p × 1 are linearly dependent.
(v)
For the square matrix case, p vectors of order p × 1 placed in the columns of A, linear dependence/independence is
determined by det(A) = 0/det(A) ≠0.

Determine whether the following sets of vectors are linearly dependent or independent
(a)

(d) 
Solution
(a)
only has the solution α = β = 0. Alternatively, the matrix of 
vectors 
has the number of columns q = 2 and rank = 2 so [q −rank(A)] = 0 
and the vectors are linearly independent.
(b)
so the vectors are linearly dependent. Alternatively, in the matrix of 
vectors 
we have col 3 = col 1 + col 2, so has zero determinant and  
rank = 2. The vectors are linearly dependent since [q −rank(B)] = 1.
(c) The matrix 
has non-zero determinant, so the vectors are linearly 
independent.
(d) The matrix 
has rank = 3 since the last three columns have a 
determinant of −4. There are four columns, so [q −rank(C)] = 1; the vectors are linearly 
dependent, in agreement with note (iii)(a). It may be checked that

5.7 THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
389
(d)
91
In a ﬂuid ﬂow problem there are ﬁve natural
parameters. These have dimensions in terms of
length L, mass M and time T as follows:
velocity = V = LT −1,
density = ρ = ML−3
distance = D = L,
gravity = g = LT −2
and
viscosity = µ = ML−1T −1
To determine how many non-dimensional
parameters can be constructed, seek values of p, q,
r, s and t so that
V pρ qDrgsµ t
is dimensionless. Write the equations for p, q, r, s
and t in matrix form and show that the resulting 
3 × 5 matrix has rank 3. Thus there are two
parameters that can be chosen independently. 
By choosing these appropriately, show that they
correspond to the Reynolds number Re = VρD/µ
and the Froude number Fr = Dg/V 2.

A popular method of numerical integration – see 
the work in Chapter 8 – involves Gaussian
integration; it is used in ﬁnite-element calculations
which are well used in most of engineering. As a
simple example, the numerical integral over the
interval −1  x  1 is written

1
−1
f(x)dx = C1f(x1) + C2 f(x2)
and the formula is made exact for the four functions
f = 1, f = x, f = x2 and f = x3, so it must be accurate
for all cubics. This leads to the four equations
C1 + C2
= 2
C1x1+ C2x2 = 0
C1x2
1+ C2x2
2 =
C1x3
1+ C2x3
2 = 0
Use Gaussian elimination to reduce the equations
and hence deduce that the equations are only
consistent if x1 and x2 are chosen at the ‘Gauss’
points ±

The eigenvalue problem
A problem that leads to a concept of crucial importance in many branches of math-
ematics and its applications is that of seeking non-trivial solutions X ≠0 to the matrix 
equation
AX = λX
This is referred to as the eigenvalue problem; values of the scalar λ for which non-
trivial solutions exist are called eigenvalues and the corresponding solutions X ≠0 are
called the eigenvectors. We saw an example of eigenvalues in Example 5.28. Such
problems arise naturally in many branches of engineering. For example, in vibrations
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the frequency and mode of vibration respect-
ively, while in mechanics they represent principal stresses and the principal axes of
stress in bodies subjected to external forces. Eigenvalues also play an important role in

390
MATRIX ALGEBRA
the stability analysis of dynamical systems and are central to the evaluation of energy
levels in quantum mechanics. 
5.7.1
The characteristic equation
The set of simultaneous equations
AX = λX
(5.33)
where A is an n × n matrix and X = [x1
x2
. . .
xn]T is an n × 1 column vector can
be written in the form
(λI −A)X = 0
(5.34)
where I is the identity matrix. The matrix equation (5.34) represents simply a set of
homogeneous equations, and we know that a non-trivial solution exists if
c(λ) = |λI −A | = 0
(5.35)
Here c(λ) is the expansion of the determinant and is a polynomial of degree n in λ,
called the characteristic polynomial of A. Thus
c(λ) = λn + cn−1λn−1 + cn−2λn−2 + … + c1λ + c0
and the equation c(λ) = 0 is called the characteristic equation of A. We note that this
equation can be obtained just as well by evaluating | A −λI | = 0; however, the form
(5.35) is preferred for the deﬁnition of the characteristic equation since the coefﬁcient
of λn is then always +1.
In many areas of engineering, particularly in those involving vibration or the control
of processes, the determination of those values of λ for which (5.34) has a non-trivial
solution (that is, a solution for which X ≠0) is of vital importance. These values of 
λ are precisely the values that satisfy the characteristic equation and are called the
eigenvalues of A.
Example 5.40
Find the characteristic equation and the eigenvalues of the matrix
Solution
Equation (5.35) gives
so the characteristic equation is
λ2 + 4λ + 3 = 0
The roots of this equation, namely λ = −1 and −3, give the eigenvalues.

5.7 THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
391
Solution
By (5.35), the characteristic equation for A is the cubic equation
Expanding the determinant along the ﬁrst column gives
= (λ −1)[(λ −2)(λ + 1) −1] −[2 −(λ + 1)]
Thus
c(λ) = λ3 −2λ2 −λ + 2 = 0
is the required characteristic equation.
For matrices of large order, determining the characteristic polynomial by direct expan-
sion of | λI −A | is unsatisfactory in view of the large number of terms involved in the
determinant expansion, but alternative procedures are available.
5.7.2
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
The roots of the characteristic equation (5.35) are called the eigenvalues of the matrix
A (the terms latent roots, proper roots and characteristic roots are also sometimes used).
By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial equation of degree n has
exactly n roots, so that the matrix A has exactly n eigenvalues λi, i = 1, 2, … , n. These
eigenvalues may be real or complex, and not necessarily distinct. Corresponding to
each eigenvalue λi, there is a non-zero solution X = ei of (5.34); ei is called the eigen-
vector of A corresponding to the eigenvalue λi. (Again the terms latent vector, proper
vector and characteristic vector are sometimes seen, but are generally obsolete.) We
note that if X = ei satisﬁes (5.34) then any scalar multiple βiei of ei also satisﬁes (5.34),
so that the eigenvector ei may only be determined to within a scalar multiple.

Solution
The matrix is the same as the one given in Example 5.40, so we would expect that these
eigenvectors correspond to the eigenvalues −1 and −3. To verify the fact we must check
that equation (5.33) is satisﬁed. Now for the ﬁrst column vector
so
is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvector −1.
For the second column vector
so
is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvector −3.
Example 5.43
Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix
Solution
To ﬁnd the eigenvalues use equation (5.35)
This characteristic equation has two roots λ = +j and −j, which are the eigenvalues, in
this case complex. Note that in general eigenvalues are complex, although in most of
the remaining examples in this section they have been constructed to be real.
To obtain the eigenvectors use equation (5.34).
For the eigenvalue λ = j then (5.34) gives
or in expanded form
ja + b = 0
with solution a = j and b = 1
−a + jb = 0
and hence the eigenvector corresponding to
For the eigenvalue λ = −j then (5.34) gives

Determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the matrix A of Example 5.41.
Solution
The eigenvalues λi of A satisfy the characteristic equation c(λ) = 0, and this has been
obtained in Example 5.41 as the cubic
λ3 −2λ2 −λ + 2 = 0
which can be solved to obtain the eigenvalues λ1, λ2 and λ3.
Alternatively, it may be possible, using the determinant form | A −λI |, to carry out
suitable row and/or column operations to factorize the determinant.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Setting | A −λI | = 0 gives the eigenvalues as λ1 = 2, λ2 = 1 and λ3 = −1. The order in
which they are written is arbitrary, but for consistency we shall adopt the convention of
taking λ1, λ2, … , λn in decreasing order.
Having obtained the eigenvalues λi (i = 1, 2, 3), the corresponding eigenvectors ei
are obtained by solving the appropriate homogeneous equations
(A −λiI)ei = 0
(5.36)
When i = 1, λ1 = 2 and (5.36) is
that is,
−e11 + e12 −2e13 = 0
−e11 + 0e12 + e13 = 0
0e11 + e12 −3e13 = 0
leading to the solution
where β1 is an arbitrary non-zero scalar. Thus the eigenvector e1 corresponding to the
eigenvalue λ1 = 2 is
e1 = β1[1
3
1]T
As a check, we can compute
and thus conclude that our calculation was correct.

0e21 + e22 −2e23 = 0
−e21 + e22 + e23 = 0
0e21 + e22 −2e23 = 0
leading to the solution
where β2 is an arbitrary scalar. Thus the eigenvector e2 corresponding to the eigenvalue
λ2 = 1 is
e2 = β2[3
2
1]T
Again a check could be made by computing Ae2.
Finally, when i = 3, λ3 = −1 and we obtain from (5.36)
that is,
2e31 + e32 −2e33 = 0
−e31 + 3e32 + e33 = 0
0e31 + e32 + 0e33 = 0
and hence
Here again β3 is an arbitrary scalar, and the eigenvector e3 corresponding to the 
eigenvalue λ3 is
e3 = β3[1
0
1]T
The calculation can be checked as before. Thus we have found that the eigenvalues of
the matrix A are 2, 1 and −1, with corresponding eigenvectors
β1[1
3
1]T,
β2[3
2
1]T
and
β3[1
0
1]T
respectively.
Since in Example 5.44 the βi, i = 1, 2, 3, are arbitrary, it follows that there are an 
inﬁnite number of eigenvectors, scalar multiples of each other, corresponding to each
eigenvalue. Sometimes it is convenient to scale the eigenvectors according to some
convention. A convention frequently adopted is to normalize the eigenvectors so that

they are uniquely determined up to a scale factor of ±1. The normalized form of an
eigenvector e = [e1
e2
…
en]T is denoted by ê and is given by
where
| e | = ÷(e2
1 + e2
2 + … + e2
n)
For example, for the matrix A of Example 5.44, the normalized forms of the eigen-
vectors are
ê1 = [1/÷11
3/÷11
1/÷11]T,
ê2 = [3/÷14
2/÷14
1/÷14]T
and
ê3 = [1/÷2
0
1/÷2]T
However, throughout the text, unless otherwise stated, the eigenvectors will always 
be presented in their ‘simplest’ form, so that for the matrix of Example 5.44 we take 
β1 = β2 = β3 = 1 and write
e1 = [1
3
1]T,
e2 = [3
2
1]T
and
e3 = [1
0
1]T
It may be noted that the three eigenvalues in Example 5.44 are linearly independent
since putting the eigenvalues into matrix form gives
det
= −6 ≠0.
From Section 5.6, Figure 5.19, this is enough to establish linearly independence. There
is a general result, which can be proved by contradiction arguments
that if an n × n matrix has n distinct eigenvalues then the corresponding eigen-
vectors are linearly independent.
The result has considerable theoretical and practical interest, but the main develop-
ment of the idea is left to the companion volume Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics. An example will illustrate one aspect of the ideas which is widely used
in the theory of iterative methods similar to those in Section 5.5.4.

Write the Fibonacci series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . . where the next term is the sum of the pre-
vious two, in matrix form and compute the general term.

of the matrix, A, are calculated as

The matrix formulation can be applied repeatedly:
Since the eigenvalues are distinct, the eigenvectors are linearly independent, so any

λ = cosθ ± j sinθ
Solving for the eigenvectors as in Example 5.43, we obtain
e1 = [1
−j]T
and
e2 = [1
j]T
In Examples 5.43 and 5.46 we see that eigenvalues can be complex numbers, and that
the eigenvectors may have complex components. This situation arises when the char-
acteristic equation has complex (conjugate) roots.
For an n × n matrix A the MATLAB command p=poly(A) generates an n + 1 ele-
ment row vector whose elements are the coefﬁcients of the characteristic polynomial
of A, the coefﬁcients being ordered in descending powers. The eigenvalues of A are
the roots of the polynomial and are generated using the command roots(p). The
command
[M,S]=eig(A)
generates the normalized eigenvectors of A as the columns of the matrix M and its
corresponding eigenvalues as the diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix S (M and
S are called respectively the modal and spectral matrices of A). In the absence of the
left-hand arguments, the command eig(A) by itself simply generates the eigen-
values of A.
For the matrix A of Example 5.44 the commands
A=[1 1 –2; –1 2 1; 0 1 –1];
[M,S]=eig(A)
generate the output
0.3015
–0.8018

These concur with our calculated answers, with β1 = 0.3015, β2 = −0.2673 and 
β3 = 0.7071.
Using the Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB the matrix A may be converted
from numeric into symbolic form using the command A=sym(A). Then its symbolic
eigenvalues and eigenvectors are generated using the sequence of commands
A=[1 1 –2; –1 2 1; 0 1 –1];
A=sym(A);
[M, S]=eig(A)
as
M=[3, 1, 1]
S=[1, 0, 0]
[2, 3, 0]
[0, 2, 0]
[1, 1, 1]
[0, 0, –1]
In MAPLE eigenvectors(A); produces the corresponding results using the linalg
package.

5.7.4
Repeated eigenvalues
In the examples considered so far the eigenvalues λi (i = 1, 2, …) of the matrix A
have been distinct, and in such cases the corresponding eigenvectors are linearly inde-
pendent. The matrix A is then said to have a full set of independent eigenvectors. It is
clear that the roots of the characteristic equation c(λ) may not all be distinct; and when
c(λ) has p  n distinct roots, c(λ) may be factorized as
c(λ) = (λ −λ1)m1(λ −λ2)m2 … (λ −λp)mp
indicating that the root λ = λi, i = 1, 2, … , p, is a root of order mi, where the integer mi is
called the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue λi. Clearly m1 + m2 + … + mp = n.
When a matrix A has repeated eigenvalues, the question arises as to whether it is 
possible to obtain a full set of independent eigenvectors for A. We ﬁrst consider some
examples to illustrate the situation.

MATRIX ALGEBRA
Solution
(a) The eigenvalues of A are obtained from
giving the value 1 repeated twice.
The eigenvectors we calculate from
which is clearly satisﬁed by any values of a and b. Thus taking
it can be seen that there are two independent eigenvectors
and
Any linear
combination of the two vectors is also an eigenvector. Geometrically this corresponds
to the fact that the unit matrix maps every vector onto itself.
(b) The eigenvalues of B are obtained from
giving the value 1 repeated twice.
The eigenvectors we calculate from
Thus d = 0 and there is only one eigenvector 
and, of course, any multiple of this
vector.
We note from Example 5.47 that the evaluation of eigenvectors leads to a much more
complicated situation when there are multiple eigenvalues. In contrast to the case of
distinct eigenvalues, where it is known that the corresponding eigenvectors are linearly
independent, for repeated eigenvalues it is not even clear how many linearly inde-
pendent eigenvectors are associated with a multiple eigenvalue λ. The idea of rank
(introduced in Section 5.6) of the matrix (λI −A) is the key to the clariﬁcation.
A second problem occurs when there are several linearly independent eigenvectors
associated with a multiple eigenvalue, as in Example 5.47(a). For instance, suppose the
eigenvalue λ has two such eigenvectors X and Y so that
AX = λX
and
AY = λY

then adding with multiples α, β
A(αX + βY) = λ(αX + βY)
We see that (αX + βY) is also an eigenvector for any α, β. This can cause confusion
since a method or computer package can throw up two eigenvectors which are differ-
ent from the ones expected but that are equally valid and belong to the set (αX + βY) 
for some α, β. In Example 5.47(a) the calculated eigenvectors are 
and 
but 
equally well eigenvectors 
and 
could have been chosen. The vectors belong to 
the same set, with α = β = 1 in the ﬁrst case and α = −β = 1 in the second case. This 
situation should be noted carefully when undertaking exercises involving a multiple
eigenvalue.
The following two 3 × 3 examples illustrate similar points.
Example 5.48
Determine the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix
Solution
We ﬁnd the eigenvalues from
as λ1 = 4, λ 2 = λ 3 = 2.
The eigenvectors are obtained from
(A −λI)ei = 0
(5.37)
and when λ = λ1 = 4, we obtain from (5.37)
e1 = [1
−1
−1]T
When λ = λ2 = λ3 = 2, (5.37) becomes
The matrix has rank = 1, so [q −rank(A −2I)] = 3 −1 = 2 and we expect two free
parameters so two linearly independent eigenvectors. They are obtained explicitly from
the single equation

MATRIX ALGEBRA
e21 −3e22 + 2e23 = 0
(5.38)
Clearly we are free to choose any two of the components e21, e22 or e23 at will, with the
remaining one determined by (5.38). Suppose we set e22 = α and e23 = β; then (5.38)
means that e21 = 3α −2β, and thus
e2 = [3α −2β
α
β]T
(5.39)
Now λ = 2 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2, and we seek, if possible, two independent
eigenvectors deﬁned by (5.39). Setting α = 1 and β = 0 yields
e2 = [3
1
0]T
and setting α = 0 and β = 1 gives a second vector
e3 = [−2
0
1]T
These two vectors are independent and of the form deﬁned by (5.39), but many other
choices are possible. However, any other choices of the form (5.39) will be linear com-
binations of e2 and e3 as chosen above. For example, e = [1
1
1]T satisﬁes (5.38), but
e = e2 + e3.
In this example, although there was a repeated eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity 2,
it was possible to construct two independent eigenvectors corresponding to this eigen-
value. Thus the matrix A has three and only three independent eigenvectors.
The MATLAB commands for Example 5.48
A=[3 –3 2; –1 5 –2; –1 3 0];
[M, S]=eig(A)

Clearly the ﬁrst column of M (corresponding to the eighenvalue λ1 = 4) is a scalar
multiple of e1. The second and third columns of M (corresponding to the repeated
eigenvalue λ2 = λ3 = 2) are not scalar multiples of e2 and e3. However, both satisfy
(5.37) and are equally acceptable as a pair of linearly independent eigenvectors 
corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue. It is left as an exercise to show that both
are linear combinations of e2 and e3.

In the linalg package of MAPLE, eigenvectors(A); produces the corresponding
results.
Example 5.49
Determine the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix
Solution
Solving | A −λI| = 0 gives the eigenvalues as λ1 = λ2 = 2, λ3 = 1. The eigenvector
corresponding to the non-repeated or simple eigenvalue λ3 = 1 is easily found as 
e3 = [1
1
−1]T
When λ = λ1 = λ2 = 2, the corresponding eigenvector is given by
(A −2I)e1 = 0
The matrix (A −2I) =
has rank = 2, so [q −rank(A)] = 1 and we expect to 
have one free parameter and hence only one independent eigenvector. Writing out in
full we look for solutions of
−e11 + 2e12 + 2e13 = 0
(i)
e13 = 0
(ii)
−e11 + 2e12
= 0
(iii)
From (ii) we have e13 = 0, and from both (i) and (iii) it follows that e11 = 2e12. We deduce 
that there is only one independent eigenvector corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue
λ = 2, namely
e1 = [2
1
0]T
and in this case the matrix A does not possess a full set of independent eigenvectors.
We see from Examples 5.47–5.49 that if an n × n matrix A has repeated eigenvalues
then a full set of n independent eigenvectors may or may not exist.
The complications introduced are seen to be resolved by determining the rank of the
matrix (A −λiI) for each of the repeated eigenvalues. This is not a simple resolution;
further details and a systematic development of the ideas can be found in the compan-
ion volume Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.

Some useful properties of eigenvalues
The following basic properties of the eigenvalues λ1, λ2, … , λn of an n × n matrix A
are sometimes useful. The results are readily proved from either the deﬁnition of
eigenvalues as the values of λ satisfying (5.33), or by comparison of corresponding
characteristic polynomials (5.35). Consequently, the proofs are left to Exercise 102.

5.7.7
Symmetric matrices
A square matrix A is said to be symmetric if AT = A. Such matrices form an important
class and arise in a variety of practical situations. Such symmetry imposes a powerful
structure to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which is summarized in the statements:
(i)
The eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real.
(ii)
For an n × n real symmetric matrix it is always possible to ﬁnd n independent
eigenvectors e1, e2, … , en that are mutually orthogonal so that eT
iej = 0 for 
i ≠j.
If the orthogonal eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix are normalized as
ê1, ê2, … , ên
then the inner (scalar) product is
êT
iêj = δij
(i, j = 1, 2, … , n)
where δij is the Kronecker delta deﬁned in Section 5.2.1.
The set of normalized eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix therefore form an ortho-
normal set (that is, they form a mutually orthogonal normalized set of vectors).
In general, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are complex, so (i) gives a considerable
simpliﬁcation and it can be proved as follows:
Proof of statement (i)
Let AX = λX
Take the complex conjugate A*X* = λ*X*; since A is real then AX* = λ*X*
Take the transpose XTAT = λXT; since A is symmetric then XTA = λXT
Pre-multiply the complex conjugate eigenvalue equation by XT to give
XTAX* = λ*XTX* →λXTX* = λ*XTX*
since
XTA = λXT
Because XTX* ≠0 we deduce that λ = λ* and the eigenvalue is therefore real.

5.7 THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
407
Proof of statement (ii) when all the eigenvalues are distinct
We ﬁrst show that the eigenvectors are orthogonal and then that they are linearly inde-
pendent. Two distinct eigenvalues satisfy
AXi = λiXi
and
AXj = λjXj
with
λi ≠λj
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by XT
j to give
XT
jAXi = λiXT
jXi
(5.40)
Multiply the second equation by XT
i to give
XT
iAXj = λjXT
iXj
with transpose
(XT
iAXj)T = λj(XT
iXj)T
and hence using the symmetry of A
XT
jAXi = λjXT
jXi
(5.41)
Now subtract (5.41) from (5.40), then
(λi −λj) XT
jXi = 0
Since the eigenvalues are distinct we have XT
jXi = 0 and the corresponding vectors are
orthogonal.
To test linear independence, consider solutions of
α1X1 + α2X2 + . . . + αnXn = 0
Multiply by XT
i. From the othogonality of the eigenvectors, when all the eigenvlaues are
distinct, the only term to survive is
αiXT
iXi = 0
and since the eigenvectors are not zero the conclusion is αi = 0 for all i. Hence the
eigenvectors are linearly independent.
The second statement (ii) is much more difﬁcult to prove for repeated eigenvalues
and is left to the companion volume Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.
The results (i) and (ii) are well used in both theory and in computational practice
since they make it clear that only real values need to be sought and any vector can be
written as the combination of the linearly independent eigenvalues. Considerable effort
goes into transforming a problem to symmetric matrix form. Review Exercise 22 gives
an illustration of spectral decomposition. Singular Value Decomposition, Jacobi and
Householder methods all rely on (i) and (ii).

Obtain the eigenvalues and corresponding orthogonal eigenvectors of the symmetric
matrix
and show that the normalized eigenvectors form an orthonormal set.

conﬁrming that the eigenvectors form an orthonormal set.
Example 5.51 considers the case of a repeated eigenvalue and gives a hint of the
Gram–Schmidt process for making a set of linearly independent vectors into an ortho-
gonal set.
Example 5.51
Show that the matrix
has eigenvalues 3, 0, 0 and construct three mutually orthogonal eigenvectors.
Solution
The characteristic equation is
so has roots 3, 0, 0. For the eigenvalue 3, check that [1
1
1]T is a solution of
For the eigenvalue 0, look for solutions of
The matrix has rank = 1, so we have [q −rank(A −0I)] = 2 and expect two linearly
independent eigenvectors. It may be checked that [−1
0
1]T and [−1
1
0]T are
two linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the zero eigenvalue.
Thus three real eigenvalues have been found, as required by the general result (i), 
and three linearly independent eigenvectors have been constructed, as required by 
the general result (ii). The eigenvectors, however, are not mutually orthogonal. The

Since the forces are in equilibrium,
k1(x1 −l1) = k2(x2 −x1 −l2)
k2(x2 −x1 −l2) = k3(L −x2 −l3)
We have two simultaneous equations in the two unknowns, which can be written in
matrix form as
It is easy to invert 2 × 2 matrices, so we can compute the solution as
If we take the simplest situation when k1 = k2 = k3 and l1 = l2 = l3 then we obtain the

of the simplest practical examples. On a more fundamental level, the vibration of
the atoms or molecules of a solid can be modelled by a lattice containing atoms or
molecules that interact with each other through spring forces. The model gives a
detailed understanding of the structure of the solid and the strength of interactions and
has practical applications in such areas as the study of impurities or ‘doped’ materials
in semiconductor physics.
The motion of these systems demands the use of Newton’s equations, which in turn
require the calculus. We shall look at methods of solution in Chapters 10 and 11. In 
this case study we shall not consider vibrations but shall restrict our attention to the
static situation. This is the ﬁrst step in the solution of vibrational systems. Even here, we
shall see that matrices and vectors allow a systematic approach to the more complicated
situation.
5.8.1
A two-particle system
We start with the very simple situation illustrated in Figure 5.20. Two masses are
connected by springs of stiffnesses k1, k2 and k3 and of natural lengths l1, l2 and l3 that
are ﬁxed to the walls at A and B, with distance AB = L. It is required to calculate the
equilibrium values of x1 and x2. We use Hooke’s law – that force is proportional to
extension – to calculate the tension:
T1 = k1(x1 −l1)
T2 = k2(x2 −x1 −l2)
T3 = k3(L −x2 −l3)

5.8.2
An n-particle system
In the simplest situation, described in Section 5.8.1, matrix notation is convenient but
not really necessary. If we try to extend the problem to many particles and many springs
then such notation simpliﬁes the statement of the problem considerably. Consider the
problem illustrated in Figure 5.21. From Hooke’s law
T1 = k1(x1 −l1)
T2 = k2(x2 −x1 −l2)
T3 = k3(x3 −x2 −l3)
\
Tr = kr(xr −xr−1 −lr)
\
Tn = kn(L −xn−1 −ln)
The equilibrium equations for each ‘unit’ are
k1(x1 −l1) = k2(x2 −x1 −l2)
k2(x2 −x1 −l2) = k3(x3 −x2 −l3)
\
kr(xr −xr−1 −lr) = kr+1(xr+1 −xr −lr+1)
\
kn−1(xn−1 −xn−2 −ln−1) = kn(L −xn−1 −ln)
In matrix form, these become

MATRIX ALGEBRA
We recognize the form of these equations immediately, since they constitute a tridiag-
onal system studied in Section 5.5.2, and we can use the Thomas algorithm (Figure 5.9)
to solve them. Thus, by writing the equations in matrix form, we are immediately able
to identify an efﬁcient method of solution.
In some special cases the solution can be obtained by a mixture of insight and phys-
ical intuition. If we take k1 = k2 = … = kn and l1 = l2 = … = ln and the couplings are all
the same then the equations become
We should expect all the spacings to be uniform, so we seek a solution x1 = α, x2 = 2α,
x3 = 3α, … . The ﬁrst n −2 equations are satisﬁed identically, as expected, and the ﬁnal
equation in matrix formulation gives [−(n −2) + 2(n −1)]α = L. Thus α = L/n, and our
intuitive solution is justiﬁed.
In a second special case where a simple solution is possible, we assume one of 
the couplings to be a ‘rogue’. We take k1 = k2 = … = kr−1 = kr+1 = … = kn = k, kr = k′ and
l1 = l2 = … = ln = l. If we divide all the equations in the matrix by k and write 
λ = k′/k then the matrix takes the form
A reasonable assumption is that the spacings between ‘good’ links are all the same.
Thus we try a solution of the form
x1 = a,
x2 = 2a,
… ,
xr−1 = (r −1)a,
xr = b
xr+1 = b + a,
xr+2 = b + 2a,
… ,
xn−1 = b + (n −1 −r)a

5.9 ENGINEERING APPLICATION: STEADY HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH COMPOSITE MATERIALS
413
It can be checked that the matrix equation is satisﬁed except for the (r −1)th, rth and
(n −1)th rows. These give respectively
−λb + a(−λ + 1 + λr) = l(1 −λ)
λb + a(λ −1 −λr)
= l(λ −1)
and 
b
+ a(n −r) 
= L
The ﬁrst two of these are identical, so we have two equations in the two unknowns, a
and b, to solve. We obtain
We note that if λ = 1 then the solution reduces to the previous one, as expected.
The solution just obtained gives the deformation due to a single rogue coupling.
Although this problem is of limited interest, its two- and three-dimensional extensions
are of great interest in the theory of crystal lattices. It is possible to determine the 
deformation due to a single impurity, to compute the effect of two or more impurities
and how close they have to be to interact with each other. These are problems with 
considerable application in materials science.
5.9
Engineering application: steady heat transfer through
composite materials
5.9.1
Introduction
In many practical situations heat is transferred through several layers of different
materials. Perhaps the simplest example is a double glazing unit, which comprises a
layer of glass, a layer of air and another layer of glass. The thermal properties and 
the thicknesses of the individual layers are known but what is required is the overall
thermal properties of the composite unit. How do the overall properties depend on the
components? Which parameters are the most important? How sensitive is the overall
heat transfer to changes in each of the components?
A second example looks at the thickness of a furnace wall. A furnace wall will 
comprise three layers: refractory bricks for heat resistance, insulating bricks for heat
insulation and steel casing for mechanical protection. Such a furnace is enormously
expensive to construct, so it is important that the thickness of the wall is minimized sub-
ject to acceptable heat losses, working within the serviceable temperatures and known
thickness constraints. The basic problem is again to construct a model that will give
some idea how heat is transferred through such a composite material.
The basic properties of heat conduction will be discussed, and it will then be seen
that matrices give a natural method of solving the theoretical equations of composite
layers.

5.9.2
Heat conduction
In its full generality heat conduction forms a part of partial differential equations (see
Chapter 9 of Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics 3rd edition). However, for
current purposes a simpliﬁed one-dimensional version is sufﬁcient. The theory is based
on the well-established Fourier law:
Heat transferred per unit area is proportional to the temperature gradient.
Provided a layer is not too thick and the thermal properties do not vary, then the tem-
perature varies linearly across the solid. If Q is the amount of heat transferred per unit
area from left, at temperature T, to right, at temperature T′, as shown in Figure 5.22,
then this law can be written mathematically as
where k is the proportionality constant, called the thermal conductivity, a is the thick-
ness of the layer and the minus sign is to ensure that heat is transferred from hot to cold.
For the conduction through an interface between two solids with good contact, as in
the situation of the furnace wall, it is assumed that
(i)
the temperatures at each side of the interface are equal;
(ii)
the heat transferred out of the left side is equal to the heat transferred into the
right side.
With the Fourier law and these interface conditions the multilayer situation can be
analysed satisfactorily, provided, of course, the heat ﬂow remains one-dimensional and
steady.
5.9.3
The three-layer situation
Let the three layers have thicknesses a1, a2 and a3 and thermal conductivities k1, k2 and
k3, as illustrated in Figure 5.23. At the interfaces the temperatures are taken to be T1, T2,
T3 and T4. The simplest problem to study is to ﬁx the temperatures T1 and T4 at the edges
and determine how the temperatures T2 and T3 depend on the known parameters.
From the speciﬁcation of the problem the temperatures at the interfaces are speciﬁed,
so it only remains to satisfy the heat transfer condition across the interface.
At the ﬁrst interface
and at the second interface
It turns out to be convenient to let 
and so on. The equations then become
u2(T2 −T1) = u1(T3 −T2)
u3(T3 −T2) = u2(T4 −T3)

or in matrix form
The determinant of the matrix is easily calculated as u2(u1 + u2 + u3), which is non-zero,
so a solution can be computed as
Thus the temperatures T2 and T3 are now known, and any required properties can be
deduced.
For the furnace problem described in Section 5.9.1 the following data is known:

T4 = 300 K

It may be noted that the thermal conductivity depends on the temperature but in these
calculations it is assumed constant (a more sophisticated analysis is required to take
these variations into account). Average values k1 = 5, k2 = 2.5 and k3 = 45.2 are chosen.
The required temperatures are evaluated as
A typical question that would be asked is how to minimize the thickness (or perhaps the
cost) subject to appropriate constraints. For instance ﬁnd
min(a1 + a2 + a3)
subject to
(300 −T3)  50000
(allowable heat loss at the right-hand boundary)
T2  1400
(below the maximum working temperature)
a1  0.1
(must have a minimum refractory thickness)
The problem is beyond the scope of the present book, but it illustrates the type of 
question that can be answered.

A more straightforward question is to evaluate the effective conductivity of the 
composite. It may be noted that in the general case, the heat ﬂow is
so the effective conductivity over the whole region is
5.9.4
Many-layer situation
Although matrix theory was used to solve the three-layer problem, it was unnecessary
since the mathematics reduced to the solution of a pair of simultaneous equations.
However, for the many-layer system it is important to approach the problem in a 
logical and systematic manner, and matrix theory proves to be the ideal mathematical
method to use.
Consider the successive interfaces in turn and construct the heat ﬂow equation for
each of them (Figure 5.24).
\
As in the three-layer case, it is convenient to deﬁne
and so on. The
equations then become
u2(T2 −T1)
= u1(T3 −T2)
u3(T3 −T2)
= u2(T4 −T3)
u4(T4 −T3)
= u3(T5 −T4)

or in matrix form
The matrix equation is of tridiagonal form, hence we know that there is an efﬁcient
algorithm for solution. An explicit solution, as in the three-layer case, is not so easy and
requires a lot of effort. However, it is a comparatively easy exercise to prove that the
effective conductivity (k) of the whole composite is obtained from the equivalent formula

Introduction
The term ‘discrete mathematics’ is often seen as describing a new and exciting area of
mathematics with applications to digital electronics. Virtually everyone these days
knows that personal computers operate using digital electronics, and previously ana-
logue systems such as radio and television transmissions are also securely digital. Digital
systems are less prone to signal loss through dissipation, attenuation and interference
through noise than traditional analogue systems. The ability of digital systems to handle
the vast quantity of information required to reproduce high-resolution graphics in a
very efﬁcient and cost-effective way is a consequence of this. Another consequence of
digitization is greater security due to less penetrable encryption algorithms based on 
the discrete mathematics of number systems. The present and the future are therefore
most deﬁnitely digital, and digital systems make use of discrete mathematics. The ironic
fact is that discrete mathematics itself is remarkably old. In fact it pre-dates calculus,
which might be called ‘continuous mathematics’. All counting is discrete mathematics.
However, it was only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that mathematicians like
George Boole (1816–1864) gave a rigorous basis to set theory. The work of Bertrand
Russell (1872–1970) and Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), and later Kurt Gödel
(1906–1978), on logic and the foundation of mathematics, which was to have a great
effect on the development of mathematics in the twentieth century, was intimately 
connected with questions of set theory. This material is now seen to be of great 
relevance to engineering. Electronic engineers have for a long time required knowledge
of Boolean algebra in order to understand the principles of switching circuits. The 
computer is now very much part of engineering: processes are computer controlled,
manufacturing by robots is now commonplace and design is computer aided. Engineers
now have a duty to understand how to check the correctness of the algorithms that
design, build and repair. In order to do this, branches of discrete mathematics such as
propositional logic have to be part of the core curriculum for engineers and not optional
extras. This chapter develops the mathematics required in a logical and systematic way,
beginning with sets and applications to manufacturing, moving on to switching circuits
and applications to electronics, and then to propositional calculus and applications to
computing.
6.2
Set theory
The concept of a set is a relatively recent one, in that it was born in the past hundred
and ﬁfty years. In the past few decades it has gained in popularity, and now forms part
of school mathematics – this is natural, since the concepts involved, although they may
seem unfamiliar initially, are not difﬁcult.
Set theory is concerned with identifying one or more common characteristics among
objects. We introduce basic concepts and set operations ﬁrst, and then examine some
applications. The largest areas of application deserve sections to themselves; however, in
this section we apply set theory fundamentals to the manufacture and efﬁcient assembly
of components.
424
AN INTRODUCTION TO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

6.2 SET THEORY
425
6.2.1
Deﬁnitions and notation
A set is a collection of objects, which are called the elements or members of the set.
We shall denote sets by capital letters such as A, S and X, and elements of a set by
lower-case letters such as a, s and x. The notation  is used as follows: if an element a
is contained in a set S then we write
a  S
which is read ‘a belongs to S’. If b does not belong to S then the symbol  is used:
b  S
read as ‘b does not belong to S’.
A ﬁnite set is one that contains only a ﬁnite number of elements, while an inﬁnite
set is one consisting of an inﬁnite number of elements. For example,
(i)
the months of the year form a ﬁnite set, while
(ii)
the set consisting of all integers is an inﬁnite set.
If we wish to indicate the composition of S then there are two ways of doing this.
The ﬁrst method is suitable only for ﬁnite sets, and involves listing the elements of the
set between open and closed braces as, for example, in
S = {a, b, c, d, e, f }
which denotes the set S consisting only of the six elements a, b, c, d, e and f.
The second method involves giving a rule by which all elements of the set can be
determined. The notation
S = {x : x has property P}
will be used to denote the set of all elements x that have the property P. For example,
(i)
S = {N: N  Z, N  500}
is the set of integers that are less than or equal to 500, and
(ii)
S = {x : x2 −x −6 = 0, x  }
is the set containing only the two elements 3 and −2.
An example of an inﬁnite set would be
S = {x :0  x  1, x  }
which denotes all real numbers that lie in the range 0 to 1, including 0 and 1 themselves.
Very seldom are we satisﬁed with the type of statement ‘S is the set of all fruit’
beloved of early school mathematics.
Two sets A and B are said to be equal if every element of each is also an
element of the other. For such sets we write A = B; otherwise we write A ≠B.
For example,
A = {3, 4}
and
B = {x : x2 −7x + 12 = 0}
are two equal sets.

If every element of a set A is also an element of the set B then A is said to be a
subset of B or, alternatively, B is a superset of A. The statement ‘A is a subset of B’ is
written A  B, while the statement ‘B is a superset of A’ is written B  A. The nega-
tions of these two statements are written as A  B and B  A respectively. Note that if
A  B and B  A then A = B, since every element of A is an element of B and vice
versa. Thus the deﬁnition of a subset does not exclude the possibility of the two sets
being equal. If A  B and A ≠B then A is said to be a proper subset of B. In order to
distinguish between a subset and a proper subset, we shall use the notation A  B to
denote ‘A is a subset of B’ and A  B to denote ‘A is a proper subset of B’. For
example,
A = {a, b, c}
is a proper subset of
B = {a, b, c, d, e, f }
A set containing no elements is called the empty or null set, and is denoted by ∅. For
example,
A = {x : x2 = 25, x even}
is an example of a null set, so A = ∅. It is noted that the empty set may be considered
to be a subset of any set.
In most applications it is possible to deﬁne sensibly a universal set U that contains
all the elements of interest. For example, when dealing with sets of integers, the uni-
versal set is the set of all integers, while in two-dimensional geometry the universal set
contains all the points in the plane. In such cases we can deﬁne the complement of a set
A: if all the elements of a set A are removed from the universal set U then the elements
that remain in U form the complement of A, which is denoted by A. Thus the sets A
and A have no elements in common, and we may write
A = {x : x  U, x  A}
Relations between sets can be illustrated by schematic drawings called Venn dia-
grams, in which each set is represented as the interior of a closed region (normally
drawn as a circle) of the plane. It is usual to represent the universal set by a surround-
ing rectangle. For example, A  B and A are illustrated by the Venn diagrams of
Figures 6.1(a) and (b) respectively.
426

Figure 6.1
6.2.2
Union and intersection
If A and B are two sets, related to the same universal set U, then we can combine A and
B to form new sets in the following two different ways.

6.2 SET THEORY
427
Union
The union of two sets A and B is a third set containing all the elements of A and all the
elements of B. It is denoted by A  B, read as ‘A union B’. Thus
A  B = {x : x  A
or
x  B}
where ‘or’ in this context is used in the inclusive sense: x is an element of A, or B, or both.
Intersection
The intersection of two sets A and B is a third set containing all the elements that belong
to both A and B. It is denoted by A 	 B, read as ‘A intersection B’. Thus
A 	 B = {x : x  A
and
x  B}
These two deﬁnitions are illustrated by the Venn diagrams of Figures 6.2(a) and (b). It
is clear from the illustration that union and intersection are commutative, so that
A  B = B  A
and
A 	 B = B 	 A
If the two sets A and B have no elements in common then A 	 B = ∅: the sets A and B
are said to be disjoint.
Since union () and intersection (	) combine two sets from within the same uni-
versal set U to form a third set in U, they are called binary operations on U. On the
other hand, operations on a single set A, such as forming the complement A, are called
unary operations on U. It is worthwhile noting at this stage the importance of the words
‘or’, ‘and’ and ‘not’ in the deﬁnitions of union, intersection and complementation, and
we shall return to this when considering applications in later sections. It is also worth
noting that the numerical solutions to the examples and exercises that follow can be
checked using MAPLE.
Example 6.1
If A = {3, 4, 5, 6} and B = {1, 5, 7, 9}, determine
(a) A  B
(b) A 	 B
Solution
(a) A  B = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
(b) A 	 B = {5}

6.2.4
Algebra of sets
In Section 6.2.2 we saw that, given two sets A and B, the operations  and 	 could be
used to generate two further sets A  B and A 	 B. These two new sets can then be
combined with a third set C, associated with the same universal set U as the sets A and
B, to form four further sets
C  (A  B), C 	 (A  B), C  (A 	 B), C 	 (A 	 B)
and the compositions of these sets are clearly indicated by the shaded regions in the
Venn diagrams of Figure 6.3.
Clearly, by using various combinations of the binary operations  and 	 and the
unary operation of complementation (–), many further sets can be generated. In prac-
tice, it is useful to have rules that enable us to simplify expressions involving , 	 and
(–). In this section we develop such rules, which form the basis of the algebra of sets.
In the next section we then proceed to show the analogy between this algebra and the
algebra of switching circuits, which is widely used by practising engineers.
Given the three sets A, B and C, belonging to the same universal set U, we have
already seen that the operations  and 	 are commutative, so that we have the 
following:

6.2 SET THEORY
429
CommutatiVe laws
A  B = B  A
(union is commutative)
(6.1)
A 	 B = B 	 A
(intersection is commutative)
It follows directly from the deﬁnitions that we have the
Idempotent laws
A  A = A
(union is idempotent)
(6.2)
A 	 A = A
(intersection is idempotent)
Identity laws
A  ∅= A
(∅is an identity relative to union)
(6.3)
A 	 U = A
(U is an identity relative to intersection)
Complementary laws
A  A = U
(6.4)
A 	 A = ∅
In addition, it can be shown that the following associative and distributive laws hold:
Figure 6.3

AssociatiVe laws
A  (B  C) = (A  B)  C
(union is associative)
(6.5)
A 	 (B 	 C) = (A 	 B) 	 C
(intersection is associative)
DistributiVe laws
A  (B 	 C) = (A  B) 	 (A  C)
(union is distributive over
intersection)
(6.6)
A 	 (B  C) = (A 	 B)  (A 	 C)
(intersection is distributive
over union)
Readers should convince themselves of the validity of the results (6.5) and (6.6) by 
considering the Venn diagrams of Figure 6.3.
The laws expressed in (6.1)–(6.6) constitute the basic laws of the algebra of sets.
This itself is a particular example of a more general logical structure called Boolean
algebra, which is brieﬂy deﬁned by the statement
A class of members (equivalent to sets here) together with two binary 
operations (equivalent to union and intersection) and a unary operation
(equivalent to complementation) is a Boolean algebra provided the opera-
tions satisfy the equivalent of the commutative laws (6.1), the identity laws
(6.3), the complementary laws (6.4) and the distributive laws (6.6).
We note that it is therefore not essential to include the idempotent laws (6.2) and
associative laws (6.5) in the basic rules of the algebra of sets, since these are readily
deducible from the others. The reader should, at this stage, reﬂect on and compare the
basic rules of the algebra of sets with those associated with conventional numerical
algebra in which the binary operations are addition (+) and multiplication (×), and 
the identity elements are zero (0) and unity (1). It should be noted that in numerical
algebra there is no unary operation equivalent to complementation, the idempotency
laws do not hold, and that addition is not distributive over multiplication.
While the rules (6.1)–(6.6) are sufﬁcient to enable us to simplify expressions involving
, 	 and (–) the following, known as the De Morgan laws, are also useful in practice.
De Morgan laws
A!^!B = A 	 B
(6.7)
A!&!B = A  B
The ﬁrst of these laws states ‘the complement of the union of two sets is the inter-
section of the two complements’, while the second states that ‘the complement of the
intersection of two sets is the union of the two complements’. The validity of the results
is illustrated by the Venn diagrams of Figure 6.4, and they are such that they enable us
to negate or invert expressions.
If we look at the pairs of laws in each of (6.1)–(6.6) and replace  by 	 and inter-
change ∅and U in the ﬁrst law in each pair then we get the second law in each pair.
430

6.2 SET THEORY
431
Conversely, if we replace 	 and  and interchange ∅and U in the second law of each
pair, we get the ﬁrst law. This important observation is embedded in the principle of
duality, which states that if any statement involving , 	 and (–) is true for all sets
then the dual statement (obtained by replacing  by 	, ∅by U and U by ∅) is also
true for all sets. This holds for inclusion, with duality existing between  and .

Using the laws (6.1)–(6.6), verify the statement
(A!&!B)  (

When carrying out a survey on the popularity of three different brands X, Y and Z of
washing powder, 100 users were interviewed, and the results were as follows: 30 used
brand X only, 22 used brand Y only, 18 used brand Z only, 8 used brands X and Y, 9
used brands X and Z, 7 used brands Z and Y and 14 used none of the brands.

Solution
We can regard the users using brands X, Y and Z as being elements of the sets X, Y and
Z respectively. If we denote the number of users using brands X, Y and Z by m then we
can illustrate all the given information by the Venn diagram of Figure 6.5. We are then
in a position to answer the two given questions.
(a) Since 14 users used none of the three brands, we have that 100 −14 = 86 users used
one or more of the brands, so
number of elements of X  Y  Z = 86
Thus, from the Venn diagram,
30 + (8 −m) + m + (9 −m) + 22 + (7 −m) + 18 = 86
94 −2m = 86
giving
m = 4 
indicating that 4 users use all three brands X, Y and Z.
(b) The number of users using brands X and Z and not Y is the number of elements 
in (X 	 Z) 	 Y, which is the region indicated as having 9 −m elements in the Venn
diagram. Thus the required answer is 9 −m = 9 −4 = 5 users.
Example 6.4
A company manufactures cranes. There are three basic types of crane, labelled A, B and
C. Each crane is assembled from a subassembly set {a, b, c, d, e, f} as follows:
A is assembled from {a, b, c, d}
B is assembled from {a, c, f}
C is assembled from {b, d, e}
In turn, the subassemblies are manufactured from basic components {p, q, r, s, t, u, v,
w, x, y} as follows:
a is manufactured from {p, q, r, s}
b is manufactured from {q, r, t, v}
c is manufactured from {p, r, s, t}
d is manufactured from {p, w, y}
e is manufactured from {u, x}
f is manufactured from {p, r, u, v, x, y}
(a) Give the make-up of the following subassemblies:
(i) a  b,
(ii) a  c  f,
(iii) d  e
(b) Given that A is made in Newcastle, and B and C are made in Birmingham, what
components need to be available on both sites?
432
AN INTRODUCTION TO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS
Figure 6.5

6.2 SET THEORY
433
Solution
The solution of this problem is a reasonably straightforward application of set theory.
From the deﬁnitions of a, b, c, d, e and f given, and the fact that the union of two sets
contains those items that are either in one or the other or both, the following can be 
written down:
(i) a  b
= {p, q, r, s, t, v}
(ii) a  c  f = {p, q, r, s, t, u, v, x, y}
(iii) d  e
= {p, u, w, x, y}
This solves (a).
Now, A is made from subassemblies {a, b, c, d}, whereas B and C require {a, b, c,
d, e, f } in all of them. Inspection of those components required to make all six sub-
assemblies reveals that subassemblies a, b, c and d do not require components u and x.
Therefore only components u and x need not be made available in both sites. Using the
notation of set theory, the solution to (b) is that the components that constitute
a  b  c  d
have to be available on both sites, or equivalently
need only be available at the Birmingham site.
Comment
Of course, Example 6.4, which took much longer to state than to solve, is far too 
simple to represent a real situation. In a real crane manufacturing company there will
be perhaps 20 basic types, and in a car production plant only a few basic types but far
more than three hierarchies. However, what this example does is show how set theory
can be used for sort purposes. It should also be clear that set theory, being precise, is
ideally suited as a framework upon which to build a user-friendly computer program
(an expert system) that can answer questions equivalent to part (b) of Example 6.4,
when questioned by, for example, a managing director.

6.3 SWITCHING AND LOGIC CIRCUITS

6.3
Switching and logic circuits
Throughout engineering, extensive use is made of switches. This is now truer than ever,
since personal computers and miniaturized electronic devices have found their way into
practically every branch of engineering. A switch is either on or off: denoted by the 
digits 1 or 0. We shall see that the analysis of circuits containing switches provides a
natural vehicle for the use of algebra of sets introduced in the last section.
6.3.1
Switching circuits
Consider a simple ‘on–off’ switch, which we shall denote by a lower-case letter such
as p and illustrate as in Figure 6.6. Such a switch is a two-state device, in that it is either
closed (or ‘on’) or open (or ‘off’). We denote a closed contact by 1 and an open con-
tact by 0, so that the variable p can only take one of the two values 1 or 0, with
p = 1 denoting a closed contact (or ‘on’ switch), so that a current is able to ﬂow
through it
and
p = 0 denoting an open contact (or ‘off’ switch), so that a current cannot ﬂow
through it
A switching circuit will consist of an energy source or input, for example a battery,
and an output, for example a light bulb, together with a number of switches p, q, r and
so on. Two switches may be combined together in two basic ways, namely by a series
connection or by a parallel connection, as illustrated in Figures 6.7 and 6.8 respectively.
Associated with such a circuit is a switching function or Boolean function f of the
variables contained in the circuit. This is a binary function with
f = 1 denoting that the entire circuit is closed
and
f = 0 denoting that the entire circuit is open
Clearly the states of f depend upon the states of the individual switches comprising 
the circuit, so we need to know how to write down an expression for f. For the series
circuit of Figure 6.7 there are four possible states:
(a) p open, q open
(b) p open, q closed
(c) p closed, q open
(d) p closed, q closed
Figure 6.6
An ‘on–off’ switch.
Figure 6.7 Two switches in series.
Figure 6.8 Two switches in parallel.

and it is obvious that current will ﬂow through the circuit from input to output only if
both switches p and q are closed. In tabular form the state of the circuit may be repre-
sented by the truth table of Figure 6.9.
Drawing an analogy with use of the word ‘and’ in the algebra of sets we write
f = p · q
with p·q being read as ‘p and q’ (sometimes the dot is omitted and p·q is written simply
as pq). Here the ‘multiplication’ or dot symbol is used in an analogous manner to 	 in
the algebra of sets.
When we connect two switches p and q in parallel, as in Figure 6.8, the state of the
circuit may be represented by the truth table of Figure 6.10, and it is clear that current
will ﬂow through the circuit if either p or q is closed or if they are both closed.
Again, drawing an analogy with the use of the word ‘or’ in the algebra of sets, we write
f = p + q
read as ‘p or q’, with the + symbol used in an analogous manner to  in the algebra of sets.
So far we have assumed that the two switches p and q act independently of one
another. However, two switches may be connected to one another so that
they open and close simultaneously
or
the closing (opening) of one switch will open (close) the other
This is illustrated in Figures 6.11(a) and (b) respectively. We can easily accommodate
the situation of Figure 6.11(a) by denoting both switches by the same letter. To accom-
modate the situation of Figure 6.11(b), we deﬁne the complement switch p (or p′) of 
a switch p to be a switch always in the state opposite to that of p. The action of the
complement switch is summarized in the truth table of Figure 6.12.
6.3.2
Algebra of switching circuits
We can use the operations ·, + and (–) to write down the Boolean function f for complex
switching circuits. The states of such circuits may then be determined by constructing
truth tables.
Example 6.5

6.3 SWITCHING AND LOGIC CIRCUITS
437
Solution
The required truth table is shown in Figure 6.13. This circuit is interesting in that it 
is closed (that is, there is a current ﬂow at the output) only if the two switches p and q
are in different states. We will see later that it corresponds to the EXCLUSIVE OR
function in logic circuits.
By constructing the appropriate truth table, it is readily shown that the operations ·, +
and (–) satisfy the following laws, analogous to results (6.1)–(6.6) for the algebra of sets:
CommutatiVe laws
p + q = q + p,
p · q = q · p
Idempotent laws
p + p = p,
p · p = p
Identity laws
p + 0 = p
(0 is the identity relative to +),
p + 1 = 1
p · 1 = p
(1 is the identity relative to ·),
p · 0 = 0
Complementary laws
p + p = 1,
p · p = 0
AssociatiVe laws
p + (q + r) = (p + q) + r,
p · (q · r) = (p · q)·r
DistributiVe laws
p + (q · r) = (p + q)·(p + r),
p · (q + r) = p · q + p · r

These rules form the basis of the algebra of switching circuits, and it is clear that it is
another example of a Boolean algebra, with + and · being the two binary operations, 
(–) being the unary operation, and 0 and 1 the identity elements. It follows that the
results developed for the algebra of sets carry through to the algebra of switching cir-
cuits, with equivalence between , 	, (–), ∅, U and +, ·, (–), 0, 1 respectively. Using
these results, complicated switching circuits may be reduced to simpler equivalent 
circuits.

Solution
f = p + p · q · r + p · q
= p · 1 + p · (q · r) + p · q
(identity, p · 1 = p, and associative)
= p ·(1 + (q · r)) + p · q
(distributive, p ·(1 + (q · r)) = p · 1 + p · (q · r))
= p · 1 + p · q
(identity, 1 + (q · r) = 1)

(identity, p · 1 = p)
= ( p + p)·(p + q)
(distributive, p + ( p · q) = ( p + p)·(p + q))
= 1 · ( p + q)
(complementary, p + p = 1)
that is,
f = p + q
(identity, 1·( p + q) = p + q)
Example 6.8
A machine contains three fuses p, q and r. It is desired to arrange them so that if p blows
then the machine stops, but if p does not blow then the machine only stops when both
q and r have blown. Derive the required fuse circuit.
Solution
In this case we can regard the fuses as being switches, with ‘1’ representing fuse intact
(current ﬂows) and ‘0’ representing the fuse blown (current does not ﬂow). We are then
faced with the problem of designing a circuit given a statement of its requirements. To
do this, we ﬁrst convert the speciﬁed requirements into logical speciﬁcation in the form
of a truth table. From this, the Boolean function representing the machine is written
down. This may then be simpliﬁed using the algebraic rules of switching circuits to
determine the simplest appropriate circuit.
Denoting the state of the machine by f (that is, f = 1 denotes that the machine is operat-
ing, and f = 0 denotes that it has stopped), the truth table of Figure 6.15 summarizes the
state f in relation to the states of the individual fuses. We see from the last two columns
that the machine is operating when it is in either of the three states
p · q · r
or
p · q · r
or
p · q · r
Thus it may be represented by the Boolean function
f = p · q · r + p · q · r + p · q · r
Simplifying this expression gives
f = ( p · r)·(q + q) + p · q · r
(distributive)
= p · r + p · q · r
(complementary)
= p · (r + q · r)
(distributive)
= p · ((r + q)·(r + r))
(distributive)
= p · (r + q)·1

Thus a suitable layout of the three fuses is as given in Figure 6.16.
In the case of this simple example we could have readily drawn the required layout
from the problem speciﬁcation. However, it serves to illustrate the procedure that could
be adopted for a more complicated problem.

Example 6.9
In a large hall there are three electrical switches next to the three doors to operate the
central lights. The three switches operate alternatively; that is, each can switch on or
switch off the lights. Design a suitable switching circuit.
Solution
The light state f is either ‘1’ (light on) or ‘0’ (light off). Denoting the three switches by
p, q and r, the state of f as it relates to the states of the three switches is given in the
truth table of Figure 6.17, remembering that operating any switch turns the light off if

it was on and turns the light on if it was off. We arbitrarily set p = q = r = 1 and f = 1
initially. We see from the last two columns that the light is on (f = 1) when the circuit
is in one of the four states
p · q · r
or
p · q · r
or
p · q · r
or
p · q · r
Thus the required circuit is speciﬁed by the Boolean function
f = p · q · r + p · q · r + p · q · r + p · q · r
In this case it is not possible to simplify f any further, and in order to design the cor-
responding switching circuit we need to use two 1-pole, 2-way switches and one 
2-pole, 2-way switch (or intermediate switch), as illustrated in Figure 6.18(a). The four 
possible combinations leading to ‘light on’ are shown in Figures 6.18(b), (c), (d) and (e)
respectively.

6.3.4
Logic circuits
As indicated in Section 6.3.1, a switch is a two-state device, and the algebra of switch-
ing circuits developed in Section 6.3.2 is equally applicable to systems involving other
such devices. In this section we consider how the algebra may be applied to logic 
circuit design.
In logic circuit design the two states denoted by ‘1’ and ‘0’ usually denote HIGH
and LOW voltage respectively (positive logic), although the opposite convention can
be used (negative logic). The basic building blocks of logic circuits are called logic
gates. These represent various standard Boolean functions. First let us consider the logic
gates corresponding to the binary operation of ‘and’ and ‘or’ and the unary operation of
complementation. We shall illustrate this using two inputs, although in practice more
can be used.
AND gate
The AND gate is commonly represented diagrammatically in Figure 6.21, and corre-
sponds to the Boolean function
f = p · q
(read ‘p and q’)
f = 1 (output HIGH) if and only if the inputs p and q are simultaneously in state 1 
(both inputs HIGH). For all other input combinations f will be zero. The correspond-
ing truth table is as in Figure 6.9, with 1 denoting HIGH voltage and 0 denoting LOW
voltage.
Figure 6.21
AND gate.

OR gate
The OR gate is represented diagrammatically in Figure 6.22, and corresponds to the
Boolean function
f = p + q
(read ‘p or q’)
In this case f = 1 (HIGH output) if either p or q or both are in state 1 (at least one input
HIGH). f = 0 (LOW output) if and only if inputs are simultaneously 0. The correspond-
ing truth table is as in Figure 6.10.
NOT gate
The NOT gate is represented diagrammatically in Figure 6.23, and corresponds to the
Boolean function
f = p
(read ‘not p’)
When the input is in state 1 (HIGH), the output is in state 0 (LOW) and vice versa. The
corresponding truth table is as in Figure 6.12.
With these interpretations of ·, +, (–), 0 and 1, the rules developed in Section 6.3.2
for the algebra of switching circuits are applicable to the analysis and design of logic
circuits.
Example 6.10
Build a logic circuit to represent the Boolean function
f = p · q + p
Solution
We ﬁrst use a NOT gate to obtain p then an AND gate to generate p · q, and ﬁnally an
OR gate to represent f. The resulting logic circuit is shown in Figure 6.24.
Example 6.11
Build a logic circuit to represent the Boolean function
f = ( p + q)·(r + s · q)
Solution
Adopting a similar procedure to the previous example leads to the logic circuit of
Figure 6.25.

Figure 6.25
Logic circuit 
f = (p + q)·(r + s· q).
So far we have considered the three logic gates AND, OR and NOT and indicated how
these can be used to build a logic circuit representative of a given Boolean function. We
now introduce two further gates, which are invaluable in practice and are frequently
used.
NAND gate
The NAND (or ‘NOT AND’) gate is represented diagrammatically in Figure 6.26, and
corresponds to the function
f = p141q
The small circle on the output line of the gate symbol indicates negation or NOT. Thus
the gate negates the AND gate and is equivalent to the logic circuit of Figure 6.27.
The corresponding truth table is given in Figure 6.28.
Note that, using De Morgan laws, the Boolean function for the NAND gate may also
be written as
f = p141q = p + q
NOR gate
The NOR (or ‘NOT OR’) gate is represented diagrammatically in Figure 6.29, and 
corresponds to the Boolean function
f = p121q
Again we have equivalence with the logic circuit of Figure 6.30 and (using the De
Morgan laws) with the Boolean function
Figure 6.26
NAND gate f = p141q.

The corresponding truth table is given in Figure 6.31.
It is of interest to recognize that, using either one of the NAND or NOR gates, it is
possible to build a logic circuit to represent any given Boolean function. To prove 
this, we have to show that, using either gate, we can implement the three basic Boolean
functions p + q, p · q and p. This is illustrated in Figure 6.32 for the NAND gate; the
illustration for the NOR gate is left as an exercise for the reader.
Example 6.12
Using only NOR gates, build a logic circuit to represent the Boolean function
f = p · q + p · q
Solution
The required logic circuit is illustrated in Figure 6.33.

We note that the Boolean function considered in Example 6.12 is the same as that 
considered in Example 6.5, where its truth table was constructed, indicating that the
output is in state 1 only if the two inputs are in different states. This leads us to deﬁning
a further logic gate used in practice.
EXCLUSIVE OR gate
The EXCLUSIVE OR gate is represented diagrammatically in Figure 6.34 and corres-
ponds to the Boolean function
f = p · q + p · q
As indicated above, f = 1 (output HIGH) only if the inputs p and q are in different states;
that is, either p or q is in state 1 but not both. It therefore corresponds to the everyday
exclusive usage of the word ‘OR’ where it is taken to mean ‘one or the other but not
both’. On the other hand, the OR gate introduced earlier is used in the sense ‘one or the
other or both’, and could more precisely be called the INCLUSIVE OR gate.
Although present technology is such that a logic circuit consisting of thousands of
logic gates may be incorporated in a single silicon chip, the design of smaller equiv-
alent logic circuits is still an important problem. As for switching circuits, simpliﬁca-
tion of a Boolean function representation of a logic circuit may be carried out using 
the algebraic rules given in Section 6.3.2. More systematic methods are available for
carrying out such simpliﬁcation. For Boolean expressions containing not more than 
six variables the pictorial approach of constructing Karnaugh maps is widely used by
engineers. An alternative algebraic approach, which is well suited for computer imple-
mentation, is to use the Quine–McCluskey algorithm. For details of such methods the
reader is referred to specialist texts on the subject.

Propositional logic and methods of proof
In the last section we dealt with switches that are either off or on. These lend them-
selves naturally to the application of set algebra. On the other hand, everyday use of
English contains many statements that are neither obviously true nor false: for example
‘Chilly for the time of year, isn’t it?’ There are, however, some statements that are imme-
diately either true or false: for example, ‘In 2004 the Summer Olympics were held in
Athens, Greece’ (true) or ‘All children watch too much television’ (false). Proposi-
tional logic can be used to analyse, simplify and establish the equivalence of statements.
Applications of propositional logic include the efﬁcient operation of computer-based
expert systems, where the user may phrase questions differently or answer in different
ways, and yet the answers are logically equivalent. Propositional logic leads naturally to
the precise formulation of the proof of statements that, though important in themselves,
are also the basis by which computer programs can be made more efﬁcient. Thus we
shall develop tools with a vast potential for use throughout engineering.
6.4.1
Propositions
A proposition is a statement (or sentence) for which it is immediately decidable
whether it is true (T) or false (F), but not both. For example
p1:
The year 1973 was a leap year
is a proposition readily decidable as false. Note the use of the label ‘p1: …’, so that the
overall statement is read ‘p1 is the statement: “The year 1973 was a leap year”’.

6.4 PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC AND METHODS OF PROOF
449
Since when considering propositions we are concerned with statements that are
decidable as true or false, we obviously exclude all questions and commands. Also
excluded are assertions that involve subjective value judgements or opinions such as
r:
The Director of the company is overpaid
Statements such as
m:
He was Prime Minister of England
n:
The number x + 3 is divisible by 3
that involve pronouns (he, she, and so on) or a mathematical variable, are not readily
decidable as true or false, and are therefore not propositions. However, as soon as the
pronoun or variable is speciﬁed (or quantiﬁed in some way) then the statements are
decidable as true or false and become propositions. Statements such as m and n are
examples of predicates.
Given any statement p, there is always an associated statement called the negation
of p. We denote this by F, read as ‘not p’. (The notations µp and ~p are also sometimes
used.) For example, the negation of the proposition p1 above is the proposition
F1:
The year 1973 was not a leap year
which is decidable as true, the opposite truth value to p1. In general the negation F of a
statement p always has precisely the opposite truth value to that of p itself. The truth
values of both p and F are given in the truth table shown in Figure 6.36.
Example 6.13
List A is a list of propositions, while list B is a list of sentences that are not propositions.
(a) Determine the truth values of the propositions in list A and state their negation
statements.
(b) Explain why the sentences in list B are not propositions.
List A:
(a) Everyone can say where they were when President J. F. Kennedy was assassinated
(b) 2n = n2 for some n  , where  is the set of natural numbers
(c) The number 5 is negative
(d) 289 301 + 1 is a prime number
(e) Air temperatures were never above 0°C in February 1935 in Bristol, UK
List B:
(a) Maths is fun
(b) Your place or mine?
(c) y −x = x −y
(d) Why am I reading this?
(e) Flowers are more interesting than calculus
(f) n is a prime number
(g) He won an Olympic medal
p

F

Figure 6.36
Truth table for F.

Solution
First of all, let us examine list A.
(a) This is obviously false. Besides those with poor memories or those from remote
parts of the world, not everyone had been born in 1963.
(b) This is true (for n = 2).
(c) This is obviously false.
(d) There is no doubt that this is either true or false, but only specialists would know
which (it is true).
(e) This is true, but again specialist knowledge is required before this can be veriﬁed.
All statements in list A are propositions because they are either true or false, never both.
The negation predicates for list A are as follows.
(a) Not everyone can say where they were when President J. F. Kennedy was 
assassinated.
(b) 2n ≠n2 for all n  .
(c) The number 5 is not negative.
(d) 289 301 + 1 is not a prime number.
(e) Air temperature was above 0°C at some time in February 1935 in Bristol, UK.
The sentences in list B are not propositions, for the following reasons.
(a) This is a subjective judgement. I think maths is fun (most of the time) – you 
probably do not!
(b) This is a question, and thus cannot be a proposition.
(c) This can easily be made into a proposition by the addition of the phrase ‘for some
real numbers x and y’. It is then true (whenever x = y).
(d) This is the same category as (b), a question.
(e) This is a subjective statement in the same category as (a).
(f) This is a predicate, since it will become a proposition once n is speciﬁed.
(g) Again, this is a predicate, since once we know who ‘he’ is, the statement will be
certainly either true or false and hence be a proposition.
6.4.2
Compound propositions
When we combine simple statements together by such words as ‘and’, ‘or’ and so on
we obtain compound statements. For example,
m:
Today is Sunday and John has gone to church
n:
Mary is 35 years old or Mary is 36 years old
constitute compound statements, with the constituent simple statements being 
respectively
450
AN INTRODUCTION TO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

6.4 PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC AND METHODS OF PROOF
451
m1: Today is Sunday,
m2:
John has gone to church
n1:
Mary is 35 years old,
n2:
Mary is 36 years old
As for switching circuits, we can again draw an analogy between the use of the words
‘or’ and ‘and’ in English and their use in the algebra of sets to form the union A  B
and intersection A 	 B of two sets A and B. Drawing on the analogy the word ‘or’ is
used to mean ‘at least one statement’ and the word ‘and’ to mean ‘both statements’. The
symbolism commonly used in propositional logic is to adopt the symbol  (analogous
to ) for ‘or’ and the symbol  (analogous to 	) for ‘and’. Thus in symbolic form the
statements m and n may be written in terms of their constituent simple statements as
m = m1  m2
(m1 and m2)
n = n1  n2
(n1 or n2)
In general for two statements p and q the truth values of the compound statements
p  q
(meaning ‘p or q’ and called the disjunction of p, q)
p  q
(meaning ‘p and q’ and called the conjunction of p, q)
are as given in the truth table of Figure 6.37.
Here are two examples that use compound statements and also make use of F
meaning ‘not p’ and
p →q
meaning p implies q. There will be more about this kind of compound statement p → q
( p implies q) when we deal with proof in Section 6.4.5.
Example 6.14
Let A, B and C be the following propositions:
A:
It is frosty
B:
It is after 11.00 a.m.
C:
Jim drives safely
(a) Translate the following statements into logical statements using the notation of this
section.
(i) It is not frosty.
(ii) It is frosty and after 11.00 a.m.
(iii) It is not frosty, it is before 11.00 a.m. and Jim drives safely.
(b) Translate the following into English sentences:
(i) A  B,
(ii) J → C,
(iii) A  K →L,
(iv) J  B →C
Solution
(a)
(i) is the negation of A, so is written J.
(ii) is A AND B, written A  B.
(iii) is slightly more involved, but is a combination of NOT A, NOT B AND C, and
so is written J  K  C.
(b)
(i) A  B is A AND B; that is, ‘It is frosty and it is after 11.00 a.m.’
(ii) J →C is NOT A implies C; that is, ‘It is not frosty, therefore Jim drives
safely’.

Example 6.15
(Adapted from Exercise 5.15 in K.A. Ross and C.R.B. Wright, Discrete Mathematics,
Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1988.) In a piece of software, we have the
following three propositions:
P:
The ﬂag is set
Q:
I = 0
R:
Subroutine S is completed
Translate the following into symbols:
(a) If the ﬂag is set then I = 0.
(b) Subroutine S is completed if the ﬂag is set.
(c) The ﬂag is set if subroutine S is not completed.
(d) Whenever I = 0, the ﬂag is set.
(e) Subroutine S is completed only if I = 0.
(f) Subroutine S is completed only if I = 0 or the ﬂag is set.
Solution
Most of the answers can be given with minimal explanation. The reader should check
each and make sure each is understood before going further.
(a) P →Q
(that is, P implies Q)
(b) P →R
(that is, P implies R)
(c) M →P
(that is, NOT R implies P)
Note that the logical expression is sometimes, as in (b) and (c), the ‘other way round’
from the English sentence. This reﬂects the adaptability of the English language, but
can be a pitfall for the unalert student.
(d) Q →P
(that is, Q implies P)
(e) R →Q
(that is, R implies Q)
(f) This is really two statements owing to the presence of the (English, not logical)
‘or’. ‘S is completed only if I = 0’ is written in logical symbols as (e) R →Q. So 
including ‘the ﬂag is set’ as a logical alternative gives
(R →Q)  P
as the logical interpretation of (f). Alternatively, we can interpret the phrase ‘I = 0 
or the ﬂag is set’ logically ﬁrst as Q  P, then combine this with ‘subroutine S is 
completed’ to give
R →(Q  P)
452

Now these two logical expressions are not the same. The sentence (f) may seem harm-
less; however, some extra punctuation or rephrasing is required before it is rendered
unambiguous. One version could read:
(f) Subroutine S is completed only if either I = 0 or the ﬂag is set (or both).
This is R →(Q  P).
Another could read:
(f) Subroutine S is completed only if I = 0 or the ﬂag is set (or both).
This is (R →Q)  P.
Part (f) highlights the fact that there is no room for sloppy thinking in this branch of
engineering mathematics.
6.4.3
Algebra of statements
In the same way as we used , 	 and (–) to generate complex expressions for sets 
we can use ,  and ~ to form complex compound statements by constructing truth
tables.
Example 6.16
Construct the truth table determining the truth values of the compound proposition
p  (p  q)
Solution
The truth table is shown in Figure 6.38. Note that this veriﬁes the analogous absorption
law for set algebra of Question 10 (Exercises 6.2.5).
The statements are said to be equivalent (or more precisely logically equivalent) if
they have the same truth values. Again, to show that two statements are equivalent we
simply need to construct the truth table for each statement and compare truth values.
For example, from Example 6.16 we see that the two statements
p  ( p  q)
and
p

are equivalent. The symbolism ≡is used to denote equivalent statements, so we can
write
p  (p  q) ≡p
By constructing the appropriate truth tables, the following laws, analogous to the results
(6.1), (6.2), (6.5) and (6.6) for set algebra, are readily veriﬁed:
CommutatiVe laws
p  q ≡q  p,
p  q ≡q  p
Idempotent laws
p  p ≡p,
p  p ≡p
AssociatiVe laws
p  (q  r) ≡(p  q)  r,
p  (q  r) ≡(p  q)  r
DistributiVe laws
p  (q  r) ≡(p  q)  (p  r),
p  (q  r) ≡(p  q)  (p  r)
To develop a complete parallel with the algebra of sets, we need to identify two unit
elements analogous to ∅and U, relative to  and  respectively.
Relative to , we need to identify a statement s such that
p  s ≡p
for any statement p. Clearly s must have a false value in all circumstances, and an
example of such a statement is
s ≡q  G
where q is any statement, as evidenced by the truth table of Figure 6.39(a). Such a state-
ment that is false in all circumstances is called a contradiction, and its role in the 
algebra of statements is analogous to the role of the empty set ∅in the algebra of sets.
Relative to , we need to identify a statement t such that
p  t ≡p
for any statement p. Clearly, t must have a true truth value in all circumstances, and an
example of such a statement is
t ≡q  G
for any statement q, as evidenced by the truth table of Figure 6.39(b). Such a statement
that is true in all circumstances is called a tautology, and its role in the algebra of state-
ments is analogous to that of the universal set U in the algebra of sets.

Introducing the tautology and contradiction statements t and s respectively leads to
the identity and complementary laws
Identity laws
p  s ≡p
(s is the identity relative to )
p  t ≡p
(t is the identity relative to )
Complementary laws
p  F ≡t,
p  F ≡s
analogous to (6.3) and (6.4) for set algebra.
It then follows that the algebra of statements is another example of a Boolean 
algebra, with  and  being the two binary operations, ~ being the unary operation and
s and t the identity elements. Consequently all the results developed for the algebra of
sets carry through to the algebra of statements with equivalence between , 	, (–),
∅,  and , , ~, s, t respectively. These rules may then be used to reduce complex
statements to simpler compound statements. These rules of the algebra of statements
form the basis of propositional logic.
Example 6.17
Construct a truth table to verify the De Morgan laws for the algebra of statements 
analogous to (6.1) for the algebra of sets.

The analogous De Morgan laws for statements are the negations

Implications and proofs
A third type of compound statement of importance in propositional logic is that of
implication, which lies at the heart of a mathematical argument. We have already met
it brieﬂy in Example 6.14, but here we give its formal deﬁnition. If p and q are two
statements then we write the implication compound statement as
If p then q
which asserts that the truth of p guarantees the truth of q. Alternatively, we say
p implies q
and adopt the symbolism p →q (the notation p ⇒q is also commonly in use).
The truth table corresponding to p →q is given in Figure 6.42. From the truth table
we see that p →q is false only when p is true and q is false. At ﬁrst the observation 
that p →q is true whenever p is false may appear strange, but a simple example should

convince you. Suppose that prior to interviews for a senior management post within a
company the candidate states
If I am appointed then company proﬁts will rise
This is clearly an implication statement p →q, with the statements p and q being
p:
I am appointed
q:
Company proﬁts will rise
If the candidate is not appointed (that is, p is ‘false’) then the statement made by the
candidate is not false – independently of whether or not the company proﬁts will rise.
Hence p →q must be ‘true’.
Example 6.18
Use truth tables to show that the following are tautologies:
(a) A →A,
(b) A  (A →B) →B
Solution
(a) The truth table in Figure 6.43 is easily constructed and shows that, no matter
whether A is true or false, A →A is true. It is thus a tautology.
(b) The truth table shown in Figure 6.44 can be drawn, and we see that all the entries
in the last column are true and the outcome of A  (A →B) →B is always true; it is
thus a tautology.
The implication statement
q →p
is called the converse of the statement p →q, and it is perfectly possible for one to be
true and the other to be false. For example, if p and q are deﬁned by the statements
p:
I go for a walk in the rain
q:
I get wet
then the implication statements p →q and q →p are
If I go for a walk in the rain then I get wet

and
If I am getting wet then I am going for a walk in the rain
respectively. The ﬁrst, p →q, is true but the second, q →p, is false (I could be taking
a shower).
An implication statement that asserts both p →q and q →p is called double 
implication, and is denoted by
p ↔q
which may be expressed verbally as
p if and only if q
or ‘p is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for q’. Again the notation p ⇔q is also 
frequently used to represent double implication.
It thus follows that p ↔q is deﬁned to be
( p →q)  (q →p)
and its truth table is given in Figure 6.45.
From Figure 6.45 we see that p ↔q is true if p and q have the same truth values,
and is false if p and q have different truth values. It therefore follows that
( p ↔q) ↔( p ≡q)
meaning that each of the statements p ↔q and p ≡q implies the other. We must be
careful when interpreting implication when negation statements are involved. A com-
monly made mistake is to assume that if the implication
p →q
is valid then the implication
F →G
is also valid. A little thought should convince you that this is not necessarily the case.
This can be conﬁrmed by reconsidering the previous example, when the negations F
and G would be
F:
I do not go for a walk in the rain
G:
I do not get wet
and F →G is
If I do not go for a walk in the rain then I do not get wet

(This is obviously false, since someone could throw a bucket of water over me.) p →q
and F →G so have different truth values. The construction of the two truth tables will
establish this rigorously. On the other hand, the implication statements p →q and 
G →F are equivalent, as can be seen from the truth table in Figure 6.46. The implica-
tion G →F is called the contrapositive form of the implication p →q.
In mathematics we need to establish beyond any doubt the truth of statements. If we
denote by p a type of statement called a hypothesis and by q a second type of statement
called a conclusion then the implication p →q is called a theorem.
In general, p can be formed from several statements; there is, however, usually only
one conclusion in a theorem. A sequence of propositions that end with a conclusion, each
proposition being regarded as valid, is called a proof. In practice, there are three ways
of proving a theorem. These are direct proof, indirect proof and proof by induction.
Direct proof is, as its name suggests, directly establishing the conclusion by a sequence
of valid implementations. Here is an example of direct proof.
Example 6.19
If a, b, c, d  , prove that the inverse of the 2 × 2 matrix
(ad ≠bc)
is
Solution
This has already been done in Section 5.4. In the context of propositional logic, we con-
veniently split the proof as follows.
H1:
If there exists a 2 × 2 matrix B such that
AB = BA = I2
where I2 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix, then B is the inverse of A

The equivalence of 
p →q and G →F.

Using H2, we deduce that

Dividing by ad −bc then gives the result.
In this proof, H1 is a deﬁnition and hence true, H2 and H3 are properties of matrices
established in Chapter 5. (It is possible to split H3 into arithmetical hypotheses detailing
the process of matrix multiplication.) Hence
H1  H2  H3 implies A−1 =
hence establishing that the right-hand side is the inverse of A.
We have seen that p →q and G →F are logically equivalent. The use of this in a proof
sometimes makes the arguments easier to follow, and we call this an indirect proof.
Here is an example of this.
Example 6.20
Prove that if a + b  15 then either a  8 or b  8, where a and b are integers.
Solution
Let p, q and r be the statements
p:
a + b  15
q:
a  8
r:
b  8
Then the negations of these statements are
F:
a + b  14
G:
a  7
H:
b  7
The statement to be proved can be put into logical notation
p →(q  r)
This is equivalent to
(q  r) →F
or, using the De Morgan laws,
(G  H) →F
If we prove the truth of this implication statement then we have also proved that
p →(q  r)
We have

Hence F  H →F is
a  7 and b  7 implies a + b  14 for integers a and b
which is certainly true.
We have thus proved that p →(q  r), as required.
Another indirect form of proof is proof by contradiction. Instead of proving ‘p is true’
we prove ‘F is false’. An example of this kind of indirect proof follows.
Example 6.21
Prove that ÷2 is irrational.
Solution
Let p be the statement
p:
÷2 is irrational
then F is the statement
F:
÷2 is rational
Here are the arguments establishing that F is ‘false’. If ÷2 is rational then there are
integers m and n, with no common factor, such that
Squaring this gives
or
m2 = 2n2
This implies that m2 is an even number, and therefore so is m. Hence
m = 2k
with k an integer
So
m2 = 4k2
However, since n2 =
m2, this implies
n2 = 2k2
and therefore n2 is also even, which means that n is even. But if both m and n are even,
they have the factor 2 (at least) in common. We thus have a contradiction, since we
have assumed that m and n have no common factors. Thus F must be false. If F is false
then p is true, and hence we have proved that ÷2 is irrational.
The ﬁnal method of proof we shall examine is proof by induction. If p1, p2, … , 
pn, … is a sequence of propositions, n is a natural number and
(a)
p1 is true (the basis for induction)
(b)
if pn is true then pn+1 is true (the induction hypothesis)

then pn is true for all n by induction. Proof by induction is used extensively by math-
ematicians to establish formulae. Here is such an example.
Example 6.22
Use mathematical induction to show that
1 + 2 + … + N =
N(N + 1)
(6.8)
for any natural number N.
Solution
Let us follow the routine for proof by induction.
First of all, we set N = 1 in the proposition (6.8):
1 =
1(1 + 1)
which is certainly true. Now we set N = n in (6.8) and assume the statement is true:
1 + 2 + … + n =
n(n + 1)
(6.9)
We now have to show that
1 + 2 + … + n + (n + 1) =
(n + 1)(n + 2)
(6.10)
which is the proposition (6.8) with N replaced by n + 1. If we add n + 1 to both sides
of (6.9) then the right-hand side becomes
n(n + 1) + (n + 1)
which can be rewritten as
( n + 1)(n + 1) =
(n + 1)(n + 2)
thus establishing the proof of the induction hypothesis. The truth of (6.8) then follows
by induction.

Engineering application: decision support
In the early 1960s many people believed that machines could be made to think and that
computers that could, for instance, automatically translate text from one language to
another or make accurate medical diagnoses would soon be available. The problems
associated with creating machines that could undertake these tasks are well illustrated
by the story (possibly apocryphal but none the less salutary) of the early language-
translating machine that was asked to translate the English sentence ‘The spirit is
willing but the ﬂesh is weak’, into Russian. The machine’s attempt was found to read,
in Russian, ‘The vodka is very strong but the meat has gone off’. Problems such as these
and the growing appreciation of the sheer magnitude of the computing power needed
to undertake these intelligent tasks (an effect often referred to as the ‘combinatorial
explosion’) ﬁnally resulted in the realization that thinking machines were further away
than some scientists had thought. Interest waned for 20 years until, in the early 1980s,
advances both in our understanding of theoretical issues in computer software and in
the design of computer hardware again brought the achievement of intelligent tasks by
computers nearer reality. In the 21st century such issues are still live.
The modern approach to producing intelligent machines (or at least machines
that seem intelligent) is through ‘decision support systems’. The basis of such a system is
a database of facts and rules together with an ‘inference engine’, that is, a computer 
program that matches some query with the known facts and rules and determines the
answer to the query. The phrase ‘data mining’ has been coined to describe the ﬁnding
of hidden and unexpected patterns in large databases. Decision trees and predicate logic
are usually behind modern data mining techniques. The essence of the ‘intelligence’ of
the system is the way in which the inference engine is able to combine the known facts,

using the given rules together with the general methods of proof that we discussed in
Section 6.4, to answer queries that could not be answered by direct interrogation of the
database of facts. The theoretical basis of these systems lies in propositional logic and
predicate calculus. The facts and rules of the expert system’s database loosely corre-
spond to the concepts of proposition and predicate that we discussed in Section 6.4.
Decision support systems that are able to answer routine queries in certain restricted
areas of knowledge are now in everyday use in industry, commerce and public service.
Such systems can, for instance, help tax lawyers advise clients, help geologists assess
the results of seismographic tests, or advise disabled people on the beneﬁts to which
they are entitled. Nearer home, the same techniques are used in computer programs that
can help with the routine drudgery of mathematics, differentiating, integrating and
manipulating expressions with a speed and accuracy that humans cannot match. It is
easy to envisage that these systems will eventually undertake some of the work of the
design engineer or design building structures and carry out the routine tasks of archi-
tecture (routeing cables and pipework within a building, for instance). Here we shall
give more of the ﬂavour of decision support systems by an example in the domain of
family relationships. Imagine that a decision support system has a set of facts about the
relationships in a certain family, such as those shown in Figure 6.47. It is easy for a human
to deduce that the family tree is that shown in Figure 6.48 (assuming, of course, that no
one in the family has been married more than once and that all the children were born
within wedlock). From the family tree a human could ascertain the truth of some further
statements about the family. For instance, it is obvious that the statement ‘Peter is the
grandfather of David’ is true and that the statement ‘Alan is the brother of Robert’ is false.
A decision support system can equally well be designed to evaluate the truth of such
statements. In order to do so it needs, as well as the facts, some rules about how rela-
tionships combine. A typical set of rules is shown in Figure 6.49. If we were to ask 
if the statement ‘Peter is a grandparent of David’ is true the system might reason as 
follows:
From fact (1) Peter is the father of Robert;
therefore, from rule (1), Peter is a parent of Robert.
From fact (8) Lilian is the wife of Robert;
therefore, from rule (4), Lilian is the spouse of Robert;
therefore, from rule (7), Robert is the spouse of Lilian.
From fact (5) Lilian is the mother of David;
therefore, from rule (2), Lilian is a parent of David.

465
Now it has been proved that Robert is the spouse of Lilian
and that Lilian is a parent of David;
therefore, from rule (6), Robert is a parent of David.
Finally, it has been proved that Peter is a parent of Robert
and Robert is a parent of David;
therefore, from rule (3), Peter is a grandparent of David.
A little more is needed to deduce that Peter is the grandfather of David and this is left
as an exercise for the reader.
Of course, the system needs a way of determining which rule to try to apply next in
seeking to prove the truth of the query. That is the role of the part of the program called
the inference engine – the inference engine attempts to prove the truth of the query by
using rules in the most effective order and in such a way as to leave no possible path to
a proof unexplored. In many decision support systems this is achieved by using a search
algorithm.
It is interesting to ask how such a system can prove that some assertion (‘Alan is the
brother of Robert’ for instance) is false. Most systems tackle this by exhaustively try-
ing every possible way of proving that the assertion is true. Then, if this fails, to most
systems, it actually means merely that, given the facts and rules at the disposal of the
systems, the assertion cannot be proved to be true. There are obviously dangers in this
approach, since an incomplete database may lead a decision support system to classify
as false an assertion that, given more complete data, can be shown to be true. If, for
instance, we were to ask the family decision support system if the statement ‘Alan is
the cousin of Robert’ is true, the system would allege it was not. On the other hand, if
we gave the system some further, more sophisticated, rules about relationships then it
would be able to deduce that the statement is actually true.

a mixing motor, a cooling-water valve, a heating device and a safety valve. We will
analyse the control of the reaction given the following data and notation:
TL = lower temperature,
Tu = upper temperature
pL = lower pressure,
pu = upper pressure
m = mixing motor,
c = cooling-water valve
h = heating device,
s = safety valve
TL = 0,
Tu = 0
temperature is too low
TL = 1,
Tu = 0

TL = 1,
Tu = 1
temperature is too high
pL = 0,
pu = 0
pressure is too low
pL = 1,
pu = 0
pressure is correct
pL = 1,
pu = 1
pressure is too high
m = 0, 1
mixing motor is off, on
c = 0, 1
cooling-water valve is off, on
h = 0, 1
heating is off, on
s = 0, 1
safety valve is closed, open
Figure 6.50 shows the container. The table in Figure 6.51 gives nine states – three 
initial states, three normal states and three danger states – exempliﬁed by the pressure
in the vessel. From this table we can write down that
s = TL· Tu· pL· pu

that is, the safety valve is only open when the temperature and pressure are too high.
The Boolean expressions for h, c and m are obtained by taking the union of the rows of
Tu, TL, pu and pL that have 1 under the columns headed h, c and m respectively. Hence
h = (TL· Tu· pL· pu) + (TL· Tu · pL· pu) + (TL· Tu · pL· pu)
= (TL + TL)·(Tu· pL· pu) + (TL· Tu· pL· pu)
using the distributive law, Tu · pL· pu being a common factor
= 1 · (Tu · pu)·(pL + (TL· pL))
= (Tu· pu)·(pL + TL)
which is a considerable simpliﬁcation. Similarly, c is given by
c = (TL· Tu· pL· pu) + (TL· Tu· pL· pu) + (TL· Tu · pL· pu)
Combining the ﬁrst and last, and using pu + pu = 1, gives
c = (TL· Tu· pL) + (TL· Tu· pL· pu)
= (TL· pL)·(Tu + (Tu· pu))
= (TL· pL)·(Tu + pu)
Finally, for m, which has six entries as 1, we get the more complicated expression
m = (TL· Tu · pL· pu) + (TL· Tu · pL· pu) + (TL· Tu· pL· pu)
+ (TL· Tu · pL· pu) + (TL· Tu· pL· pu) + (TL· Tu · pL· pu)
Labelling these brackets 1, … , 6, and leaving 1 and 6 alone, we note that 2 and 3 
combine since TL· Tu · pu is common, and 4 and 5 combine since Tu· pL· pu is common;
hence

Introduction
In the analysis of practical problems, certain mathematical ideas and techniques appear
in many different contexts. One such idea is the concept of a sequence. Sequences occur
in management activities such as the determination of programmes for the maintenance
of hardware or production schedules for bulk products. They also arise in investment
plans and ﬁnancial control. They are intrinsic to computing activities, since the most
important feature of computers is their ability to perform sequences of instructions
quickly and accurately. Sequences are of great importance in the numerical methods
that are essential for modern design and the development of new products. As well as
illustrating these basic applications, we shall show how these simple ideas lead to the
idea of a limit, which is a prerequisite for a proper understanding of the calculus and
numerical methods. Without that understanding, it is not possible to form mathemat-
ical models of real problems, to solve them or to interpret their solutions adequately. 
At the same time, we shall illustrate some of the elementary properties of the standard
functions described in Chapter 2 and how they link together, and we shall look forward
to further applications in more advanced engineering applications, in particular to the
work on Z transforms contained in the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics.
7.2
Sequences and series
7.2.1
Notation
Consider a function f whose domain is the set of whole numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, …}. The
set of values of the function { f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3), …} is called a sequence. Usually we
denote the values using a subscript, so that f(0) = f0, f(1) = f1, f(2) = f2, and so on. Often
we list the elements of a sequence in order, on the assumption that the ﬁrst in the list is
f0, the second is f1 and so on. For example, we may write
‘Consider the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …’
implying f0 = 1, f5 = 8, f8 = 34 and so on. In this example the continuation dots … are
used to imply that the sequence does not end. Such a sequence is called an inﬁnite
sequence to distinguish it from ﬁnite or terminating sequences. The ﬁnite sequence
{ f0, f1, … , fn} is often denoted by { fk}n
k=0 and the inﬁnite sequence by { fk}∞
k=0. When the
context makes the meaning clear, the notation is further abbreviated to { fk}. Here the
letter k is used as the ‘counting’ variable. It is a dummy variable in the sense that we
could replace it by any other letter and not change the result. Often n and r are used as
dummy variables.
Example 7.1
A bank pays interest at a ﬁxed rate of 8.5% per year, compounded annually. A customer
deposits the ﬁxed sum of £1000 into an account at the beginning of each year. How
much is in the account at the beginning of each of the ﬁrst four years?

Solution
Let £xn denote the amount in the account at the beginning of the (n + 1)th year. Then
Amount at beginning of ﬁrst year
x0 = 1000
Amount at beginning of 2nd year
x1 = 1000(1 +
) + 1000 = 2085
Amount at beginning of 3rd year
x2 = 2085(1 + 0.085) + 1000 = 3262.22
Amount at beginning of 4th year
x3 = 3262.22(1.085) + 1000 = 4539.51
We can see that in general
xn = 1.085xn−1 + 1000
This is a recurrence relation, which gives the value of each element of the sequence
in terms of the value of the previous element.
Example 7.2
Consider, again, the ducting of a number of cables of the same diameter d (Example
2.2). The diameter Dn of the smallest duct with circular cross-section depends on the
number n of cables to be enclosed, as shown in Figure 7.1:
D0 = 0,
D1 = d,
D2 = 2d,
D3 = (1 + 2/÷3)d,
D4 = (1 + ÷2)d
D5 =
÷[2(5 −÷5)]d,
D6 = 3d,
D7 = 3d, …
Thus the duct diameters form a sequence of values {D1, D2, D3, …} = {Dn}∞
n=1.
Example 7.3
A computer simulation of the crank and connecting rod mechanism considered in
Example 2.44 evaluates the position of the end Q of the connecting rod at equal intervals
of the angle x°. Given that the displacement y of Q satisﬁes
y = r cos x° + ÷(l2 −r 2sin2x°)
ﬁnd the sequence of values of y where r = 5, l = 10 and the interval between successive
values of x° is 1°.

7.2 SEQUENCES AND SERIES
475
Solution
In this example the independent variable x is restricted to the sequence of values 
{0, 1, 2, … , 360}. The corresponding sequence of values of y can be calculated from
the formula
yk = 5 cos k° + ÷(100 −25sin2k°)
= 5[cos k° + ÷(4 −sin2k°)] 
= 5[cos k° + ÷(3 + cos2k°)]
Thus
{yk}360
k=0 = {15, 14.999, 14.995, 14.990, … , 14.999, 15}
This example is considered again in Section 12.5.
Notice how in Example 7.3 we did not list every element of the sequence. Instead, 
we relied on the formula for yk to supply the value of a particular element in the
sequence. In Example 7.1 we could use the recurrence relation to determine the
elements of the sequence. In Example 7.2, however, there is no formula or recurrence
relation that enables us to work out the elements of the sequence. These three examples
are representative of the general situation.
A series is an extended sum of terms. For example, a very simple series is the sum
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11
When we look for a general formula for summing such series, we effectively turn it into
a sequence, writing, for example, the sum to eleven terms as S11 and the sum to n terms
as Sn, where
Sn = 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n =
Series often occur in the mathematical analysis of practical problems and we give some
important examples later in this chapter.
7.2.2
Graphical representation of sequences
Sequences, as remarked earlier, are functions whose domains are the whole numbers.
We can display their properties using a conventional graph with the independent 
variable (now an integer n) represented as points along the positive x axis. This will
show the behaviour of the sequence for low values of n but will not display the whole
behaviour adequately. An alternative approach displays the terms of the sequence against
the values of l/n. This enables us to see the whole sequence but in a rather ‘telescoped’
manner. When the terms of a sequence are generated by a recurrence relation a third
method, known as a cobweb diagram, is available to us. We will illustrate these three
methods in the examples below.

Solution
By means of a calculator we can obtain the terms of the sequence explicitly (to 2dp) as
{0, 1.50, 0.67, 1.25, 0.80, 1.17, 0.86, 1.12, 0.89, 1.10}
The graph of this function is strictly speaking the set of points
{(1, 0), (2, 1.5), (3, 0.67), … , (10, 1.1)}
These can be displayed on a graph as isolated points but it is more helpful to the 
reader to join the points by straight line segments, as shown in Figure 7.2. The ﬁgure
tells us that the values of the sequence oscillate about the value 1, getting closer to it 
as n increases.
Example 7.5
Calculate the sequence {n1/n}10
n=4 and show the points {(1/n, n1/n)}10
n=4 on a graph.
Solution
Using a calculator we obtain (to 2dp)
{n1/n}10
n=4 = {1.41, 1.38, 1.35, 1.32, 1.30, 1.28, 1.26}
and the set of points is
{(1/n, n1/n)}10
n=4 = {(0.25, 1.41), (0.2, 1.38), … , (0.1, 1.26)}
In Figure 7.3 these points are displayed with a smooth curve drawn through them. The
graph suggests that as n increases (i.e. 1/n decreases), n1/n approaches the value 1.

Solution
Using a calculator we obtain (to 2dp) the values of the sequence
{xn}6
n=0 = {1, 1.83, 1.16, 1.64, 1.27, 1.54, 1.33}
We can display this sequence very effectively using a cobweb diagram. To construct
this we ﬁrst draw the graphs of y = (x + 10)/(5x + 1) and y = x, as shown in Figure 7.4(a).
Then we construct the points of the sequence by starting at x = x0 = 1. Drawing a
vertical line through x = 1, we cut y = x at x0 and y = (x + 10)/(5x + 1) at y = x1. Now
drawing the horizontal line through (x0, x1) we ﬁnd it cuts y = x at x1. Next we draw the
vertical line through (x1, x1) to locate x2 and so on, as shown in Figure 7.4(b). We can
see from this diagram that as n increases, xn approaches the point of intersection of the
two graphs, that is, the value α where
(α  0)
This gives α = ÷2. The value α is termed the ﬁxed point of the iteration. Setting xn = α
returns the value xn+1 = α.
As we have seen, three different methods can be used for representing sequences graph-
ically. The choice of method will depend on the problem context.

{5, 15/8, 45/64, 135/512, …}

A sequence is deﬁned by xn = pn + q where p and q
are constants. If x2 = 7 and x8 = −11, ﬁnd p and q
and write down
(a) the ﬁrst four terms of the sequence;
(b) the deﬁning recurrence relation for the sequence.
In MATLAB a sequence { fn}n=a
n=b may be calculated by setting up an array of values
for both n and y = fn. Considering the sequence of Example 7.4, the commands
n = 1:1:10;
y = 1 + ((–1).^n)./n
produce an array for the calculated values of the sequence. The additional command
plot(n,y ‘*’)
plots a graph of the points shown in Figure 7.2.
In MAPLE the sequence is calculated using the command
evalf(seq(1 + (–1)^n/n, n = 1..10));
Using the maple command in MATLAB’s Symbolic Math Toolbox the sequence
may be calculated using the commands
syms n
maple(‘evalf(seq(1 + (–1)^n/n,n = 1..10))’)
If the sequence is given as a recurrence relationship xn+1 = f(xn), as in Example 7.6,
then it may be calculated in MATLAB by ﬁrst expressing f as an inline object 
and then using a simple for-end loop. Thus for the sequence of Example 7.6 the
commands
f = inline(‘(x + 10)/(5*x + 1)’)
x = 1; y(1) = x;
for n = 1:6
y(n + 1) = f(x); x = y(n + 1);
end
double(y)
return the answer:
1.0000 1.8333 1.1639 1.2669 1.5361 1.3290
and the additional command
plot(y ‘–’)
plots a graph of the sequence.

Finite sequences and series
In this section we consider some ﬁnite sequences and series that are frequently used in
engineering.
7.3.1
Arithmetical sequences and series
An arithmetical sequence is one in which the difference between successive terms 
is a constant number. Thus, for example, {2, 5, 8, 11, 14} and {2, 0, −2, −4, −6, −8, 
−10} deﬁne arithmetical sequences. In general an arithmetical sequence has the form
{a + kd}n−1
k=0 where a is the ﬁrst term, d is the common difference and n is the number 
of terms in the sequence. Thus, in the ﬁrst example above, a = 2, d = 3 and n = 5, and
in the second example, a = 2, d = −2 and n = 7. (The old name for such sequences was
arithmetical progressions.) The sum of the terms of an arithmetical sequence is an
arithmetical series. The general arithmetical series is
Sn = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + … + [a + (n −1)d]
(7.1)
To obtain an expression for the sum of the n terms in this series, write the series in the
reverse order,
Sn =
a
+
(a + d)
+
(a + 2d)
+ … + [a + (n −1)d]
Sn = [a + (n −1)d] + [a + (n −2)d] + [a + (n −3)d] + … +
a
Summing the two series then gives
2Sn = [2a + (n −1)d] + [2a + (n −1)d] + [2a + (n −1)d] + … + [2a + (n −1)d]
giving the sum Sn of the ﬁrst n terms of an arithmetical series as
Sn =
n[2a + (n −1)d] =
n(ﬁrst term + last term)
(7.2)
The result is illustrated geometrically for n = 6 in Figure 7.6, where the breadth of each
rectangle is unity and the area under each shaded step is equal to a term of the series.
In particular, when a = 1 and d = 1,
Sn = 1 + 2 + … + n =

Example 7.7
How many terms of the arithmetical series 11, 15, 19, etc. will give a sum of 341?
Solution
In this particular case the ﬁrst term a = 11 and the common difference d = 4. We need
to ﬁnd the number of terms n such that the sum Sn is 341. Using the result in (7.2)
Sn = 341 =
n[2(11) + (n −1)(4)]
leading to
4n2 + 18n −682 = 0
or
(4n + 62)(n −11) = 0
giving
n = 11
or
n =
Since n =
is not a whole number, the number of terms required is n = 11.
Example 7.8
A contractor agrees to sink a well 40 metres deep at a cost of £30 for the ﬁrst metre,
£35 for the second metre and increasing by £5 for each subsequent metre.
(a) What is the total cost of sinking the well?
(b) What is the cost of drilling the last metre?
Solution
(a) The total cost constitutes an arithmetical series whose terms are the cost per metre.
Thus, taking a = 30, d = 5 and n = 40 in (7.2) gives the total cost
Sn = £
[2(30) + (40 −1)5] = £5100
(b) The cost of drilling the last metre is given by the 40th term of the series. Since the
nth term is a + (n −1)d, the cost of drilling the last metre = 30 + (40 −1)5 = £225.
7.3.2
Geometric sequences and series
A geometric sequence is one in which the ratio of successive terms is a constant 
number. Thus, for example, {2, 4, 8, 16, 32} and {2, −1, 
, −, 
, −
, 
} deﬁne 
geometric sequences. In general a geometric sequence has the form {ark}n−1
k=0 where a is
the ﬁrst term, r is the common ratio and n is the number of terms in the sequence. Thus,
in the ﬁrst example above, a = 2, r = 2, n = 5 and, in the second example, a = 2, r = −
and n = 7. (The old name for such sequences was geometric progressions.) The sum of
the terms of a geometric sequence is called a geometric series. The general geometric
series has the form
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + … + arn−1

To obtain the sum Sn of the ﬁrst n terms of the series we multiply Sn by the common
ratio r, to obtain
rSn = ar + ar2 + … + arn−1 + arn
Subtracting this from Sn then gives
Sn −rSn = a −arn
so that
(1 −r)Sn = a(1 −rn)
Thus for r ≠1, the sum of the ﬁrst n terms is
(7.4)
Clearly, for the particular case of r = 1 the sum is Sn = an.
The geometric series is very important. It has many applications in practical problems
as well as within mathematics.
Example 7.9
In its publicity material an insurance company guarantees that, for a ﬁxed annual pre-
mium payable at the beginning of each year for a period of 25 years, the return will be at
least equivalent to the premiums paid, together with 3% per annum compound interest.
For an annual premium of £250 what is the guaranteed sum at the end of 25 years?
Solution
The ﬁrst-year premium earns interest for 25 years and thus guarantees
£250(1 + 0.03)25
The second-year premium earns interest for 24 years and thus guarantees
£250(1 + 0.03)24
\
The ﬁnal-year premium earns interest for 1 year and thus guarantees
£250(1 + 0.03)
Thus, the total sum guaranteed is
£250[(1.03) + (1.03)2 + … + (1.03)25]
The term inside the square brackets is a geometric series. Thus, taking a = 1.03, r = 1.03
and n = 25 in (7.4) gives

7.3.3
Other ﬁnite series
In addition to the arithmetical and geometric series, there are other ﬁnite series that occur
in engineering applications for which an expression can be obtained for the sum of the
ﬁrst n terms. We shall illustrate this in Examples 7.10 and 7.11.
Example 7.10
Consider the sum-of-squares series
Sn = 12 + 22 + 32 + … + n2 =
Obtain an expression for the sum of this series.
Solution
There are various methods for ﬁnding the sum. A method that can be generalized makes
use of the identity
(k + 1)3 −k3 = 3k2 + 3k + 1
Thus
[(k + 1)3 −k3] =
(3k2 + 3k + 1)
The left-hand side equals
23 −13 + 33 −23 + 43 −33 + … + (n + 1)3 −n3 = (n + 1)3 −1
The right-hand side equals
Now

Obtain the sum of the series
Solution
The technique for summing this series is to express the general term in its partial 
fractions:
Then
giving
There are many other similar series that can be summed by expressing the general term
in its partial fractions. Some examples are given in Exercises 7.3.4.
Example 7.12
Obtain the sum of the series
Sn = 1 + 2r + 3r2 + 4r3 + … + nrn−1 =
r ≠ 1
Solution
The technique for summing this arithmetico-geometric series is similar to that for 
summing geometric series. We multiply Sn by r and then subtract the result from Sn. Thus
rSn = r + 2r2 + 3r3 + … + nrn
and
(1 −r)Sn = 1 + r + r 2 + r3 + … rn−1 −nrn
The ﬁrst n terms on the right-hand side of this equation form a geometric series, and

Hence
(7.6)
Where r = 1, Sn = n(n + 1) of course. This method can be generalized to obtain the sum
of other similar series, for example
Example 7.13
Sum the series
Sn = 1 + cosθ + cos2θ + … + cos(n −1)θ
Solution
The easiest way of summing this series is to recall Euler’s formula (Section 3.2.7)
e jθ = cosθ + j sin θ
Then we can write
Sn = Re{1 + e jθ + e j2θ + e j3θ + … + e j(n−1)θ}
The series inside the brackets is a geometric series with common ratio e jθ and using
result (7.4) we obtain
Rearranging the expression inside the brackets we have
The same method can be used to show that  
= sin(n + 1)θsin(nθ)/sin
.
Symbolic summation may be achieved in MATLAB using the symsum command.

Recurrence relations
We saw in Example 7.1 that sometimes the elements of a sequence satisfy a recurrence
relation such that the value of an element xn of a sequence {xk} can be expressed in terms
of the values of earlier elements of the sequence. In general we may have a formula of
the form

xn = f(xn−1, xn−2, … , x1, x0)
In this section we are going to consider two commonly occurring types of recurrence
relation. These will provide sufﬁcient background to make possible the solution of
more difﬁcult problems.
7.4.1
First-order linear recurrence relations with 
constant coefﬁcients
These relations have the general form
xn+1 = axn + bn,
n = 0, 1, 2, …
where a is constant and bn is a known sequence. The simplest case that occurs is when
bn = 0, when the relation reduces to
xn+1 = axn
(7.7)
This is called a homogeneous relation and every solution is a geometric sequence of
the form
xn = Aan
(7.8)
This is called the general solution of (7.7) since A is a constant which may be given
any value. To determine the value of A we require more information about the
sequence. For example, if we know the value of x0 (say C) then C = Aa0, which gives
the value of A.
A slightly more difﬁcult example is
xn+1 = axn + b
(7.9)
where b is a constant as well as a.
If the ﬁrst term of the sequence is x0 = C, as before, then
x1 = aC + b
x2 = ax1 + b = a(aC + b) + b = Ca2 + b(1 + a)
x3 = ax2 + b = a[Ca2 + b(1 + a)] + b = Ca3 + b(1 + a + a2)
and so on.
In general, we obtain
Rearranging, we can express this as
(7.10)
where A = C −b/(1 −a). After the next example we will see that this solution (and that
of more general problems) can be obtained more quickly by an alternative method.

Notice that Aan is the general solution of the homogeneous relation (7.7) and that 
xn = b/(1 −a), for all n, satisﬁes the full recurrence relation xn+1 = axn + b, so that it is
a particular solution of the relation.
Example 7.14
Calculate the ﬁxed annual payments £B required to amortize a debt of £D over N years,
when the rate of interest is ﬁxed at 100i%.
Solution
Let £dn denote the debt after n years. Then, following the same argument as in 
Example 7.1, d0 = D and
dn+1 = (1 + i)dn −B
This is similar to the recurrence relation (7.9) but with a = (1 + i) an b = −B. Hence,
using (7.10) we can write the general solution as
In addition, we know that d0 = D so that D = A + B/i and thus the particular solution is
given by
dn = (D −B/i)(1 + i)n + B/i
We require the value of B so that the debt is zero after N years, that is dN = 0. Thus
0 = (D −B/i)(1 + i)N + B/i
Solving this equation for B gives
as the required payment.
In summary, we have that the general solution to the ﬁrst-order recurrence relation
xn+1 = axn + b
can be expressed as the sum of the general solution of the reduced relation
xn+1 = axn
and a particular solution of the full relation (7.9).
This is true for linear recurrence relations in general, that is, recurrence relations of
the form
xn+1 = anxn + an−1xn−1 + … + a1x1 + a0
where the coefﬁcients ak are independent of the xk but may depend on n. The property
is easy to show in full generality but the same proof holds for the simplest case (7.9)
above.

Suppose we can identify one particular solution pn of (7.9) so that
pn+1 = apn + b
Now we seek a function qn which complements pn in such a way that
xn = pn + qn
is the general solution of (7.9). Substituting xn into this relation gives
pn+1 + qn+1 = apn + aqn + b
Since pn+1 = apn + b, this implies that
qn+1 = aqn
From (7.8), the general solution of this relation is
qn = Aan
where A is a constant. Thus the general solution of (7.9) is
xn = pn + Aan
Because qn complements pn to form the general solution, it is usually called the 
complementary solution. As we have seen, with ﬁrst-order recurrence relations, we
can always ﬁnd the complementary solution. Thus we are left with the task of ﬁnd-
ing the particular solution pn. The method for ﬁnding pn depends on the term b, as we
illustrate in Example 7.15.
Indeed, the property of the general solution being the sum of a particular solution and
a complementary solution applies to all linear systems, both continuous and discrete.
We will meet it again in Chapter 10 when considering the general solution of linear
ordinary differential equations.
Example 7.15
Find the general solutions of the recurrence relations
(a) xn+1 = 3xn + 4
(b) xn+1 = xn + 4
(c) xn+1 = αxn + Cβ n
(d) xn+1 = αxn + Cα n
(α, β, C given constants)
Solution
(a) First we try to ﬁnd any function of n which will satisfy the relation. Since it con-
tains the constant term 4, it is common sense to see if a constant K can be found which
satisﬁes the relation. (Then all terms will be constants.) Setting xn = K implies xn+1 = K
and we have
K = 3K + 4
which gives K = −2. Thus, in this case, we can choose pn = −2. Next we ﬁnd the 
complementary solution qn, which is the general solution of
xn+1 = 3xn
From (7.8) we can see that qn = A3n where A is a constant. Thus the general solution of
(a) is
xn = −2 + A3n

7.4 RECURRENCE RELATIONS

(b) The basic steps are the same for this relation. We ﬁrst ﬁnd a particular solution pn
of the relation. Then we ﬁnd the complementary solution qn, so that xn = pn + qn is the
general solution. In this case trying xn = K leads nowhere, since we obtain the incon-
sistent equation K = K + 4. Trying something a little more complicated than just a
constant, we set xn = Kn and xn+1 = K(n + 1) and we have
K(n + 1) = Kn + 4
which yields K = 4 and pn = 4n. The general solution of xn+1 = xn is qn = A1n, so that the
general solution of (b) is
xn = 4n + A
(c)
(c) Since the recurrence relation has the term Cβ n, it is natural to expect a solution of
the form Kβ n, where K is a constant, to satisfy the relation. Setting xn = Kβ n gives
Kβ n+1 = αKβ n + Cβ n
Dividing through by β n gives Kβ = αK + C, from which we deduce K = C/(β −α)
provided that β ≠α. Thus we deduce the particular solution
pn = Cβ n/(β −α)
The complementary solution qn is the general solution of
xn+1 = αxn
which, using (7.7), is qn = Aα n. Hence the general solution of (c) is
xn = Cβ n/(β −α) + Aα n
(d) This is the special case of (c) where β = α. If we set pn = Kα n, we obtain the 
equation Kα n+1 = Kα n+1 + Cα n, which can only be true if C = 0. (We see then that pn is
the solution of xn+1 = αxn, that is, it is the complementary solution.) As in case (b), we
instead seek a solution of the form pn = Knα n, so that pn+1 = K(n + 1)α n+1 and
K(n + 1)α n+1 = αKnα n + Cα n
This last equation gives K = C/α. Hence the general solution of (d) is
xn = Cnα n−1 + Aα n
where A is an arbitrary constant.

= 40 × 3n

(b) Further verify that xn = A(−2)n + B3n, where A and B are constants, is also a solution.
Solution
(a) Where xn = 3n
xn+2 −xn+1 −6xn = 3n+2 −3n+1 −6x3n
= (32 −3 −6)3n = 0
Where xn = (−2)n
xn+2 −xn+1 −6xn = (−2)n+2 −(−2)n+1 −6(−2)n = (4 + 2 −6)(−2)n = 0
Hence xn = 3n and xn = (−2)n are solutions of the recurrence relation.
(b) Setting xn = A(−2)n + B(3n) gives
A(−2)n+2 + B3n+2 −A(−2)n+1 −B3n+1 −6A(−2)n −6B(3)n
= A[(−2)n+2 −(−2)n+1 −6(−2)n] + B[3n+2 −3n+1 −6(3n)]
= A.0 + B.0 = 0
So xn = A(−2)n + B3n is a solution of the recurrence relation also.
A second-order linear recurrence with constant coefﬁcients has the form
xn+2 = axn+1 + bxn + cn
(7.11)
If cn = 0 for all n, then the relation is said to be homogeneous. As before, the solution
of (7.11) can be expressed in the form
xn = pn + qn
where pn is any solution which satisﬁes (7.11), while qn is the general solution of the
associated homogeneous recurrence relation
xn+2 = axn+1 + bxn
(7.12)
Let α and β be the two roots of the algebraic equation
λ2 = aλ + b
so that α n+2 = aα n+1 + bα n and β n+2 = aβ n+1 + bβ n, which imply that yn = α n and yn = β n
are particular solutions of (7.12). Since (λ −α)(λ −β) = 0 implies λ2 = (α + β)λ −αβ
we may rewrite (7.12) as
xn+2 = (α + β)xn+1 −αβxn
Rearranging the relation, we have
xn+2 −αxn+1 = β(xn+1 −αxn)
Substituting tn = xn+1 −αxn, this becomes
tn+1 = βtn
with general solution, from (7.8), tn = Cβ n where C is any constant.

Thus
xn+1 −αxn = Cβ n
which, using the results of Example 7.15(c) and (d), has the general solution
Since C is any constant, we can rewrite this in the neater form
(7.13)
where A and B are arbitrary constants. Thus (7.13) gives the general solution of (7.12)
where α and β are the roots of the equation
λ2 = aλ + b
This is called the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation; the Greek letter
lambda λ is used as the unknown instead of x to avoid confusion.
Example 7.18
Find the solution of the Fibonacci recurrence relation
xn+2 = xn+1 + xn
given x0 = 1, x1 = 1.
Solution
The characteristic equation of the recurrence relation is
λ2 = λ + 1
which has roots λ1 = (1 + ÷5)/2 and λ2 = (1 −÷5)/2.
Hence its general solution is
Since x0 = 1, we deduce 1 = A + B
Since x1 = 1, we deduce
Solving these simultaneous equations gives
A = (1 + ÷5)/(2÷5) and B = −(1 −÷5)/(2÷5)
and hence
deﬁning the Fibonacci sequence explicitly.

7.4 RECURRENCE RELATIONS
495
We have seen that we can always ﬁnd the complementary solution qn of the recurrence
relation (7.11)
xn+2 = axn+1 + bxn + cn
The general solution of this relation is the sum of a particular solution pn of the relation
and its complementary solution qn. The problem, then, is how to ﬁnd one solution pn.
Here we will use methods based on experience and trial and error.
Example 7.19
Find all the solutions of
(a) xn+2 =
xn+1 −
xn + 12, where x0 = x1 = 1
(b) xn+2 =
xn+1 −
xn + 12n
(c) xn+2 =
xn+1 −
xn + 3(2n)
Solution
(a) First we ﬁnd the general solution of the associated homogeneous relation 
xn+2 =
xn+1 −
xn which has characteristic equation λ2 =
λ −
with roots λ = 3 and 
λ = . Thus, the complementary solution is
xn = A3n + B( )n
Next we ﬁnd a particular solution of
xn+2 =
xn+1 −
xn + 12
We try the simplest possible function xn = K (for all n). Then, if this is a solution, we have
K =
K −
K + 12
giving K = −12.
Thus pn = −12 and the general solution is
xn = −12 + A3n + B( )n
Applying the initial data x0 = 1, x1 = 1 gives two equations for the arbitrary constants A
and B
A + B −12 = 1
3A +
B −12 = 1
from which we deduce A = 13/5 and B = 52/5. Thus the particular solution which ﬁts
the initial data is
(b) This has the same complementary solution as (a), so we have only to ﬁnd a particu-
lar solution. We try the function xn = Kn + L, where K and L are constants. Substituting
into the recurrence relation gives
K(n + 2) + L ≡
[K(n + 1) + L] −
[Kn + L] + 12n
Thus
Kn + 2K + L ≡2Kn +
K + 2L + 12n

Comparing coefﬁcients of n gives
K = 2K + 12
so that K = −12.
Comparing the terms independent of n gives
2K + L ≡
K + 2L
so that L = −K = 18, and the general solution required is
xn = −12n + 18 + A3n + B( )n
(c) This has the same complementary function as (a) so we only need to ﬁnd a particular
solution. To ﬁnd this we try xn = K2n, giving
K(2n+2) =
K(2n+1) −
K(2n) + 3(2n)
so that
(4 −7 +
)K(2n) = 3(2n)
Hence K = −2 and the general solution required is
xn = −2(2n) + A3n + B/2n
Difference equations can be solved directly in MAPLE using the rsolve command.
For example, considering Example 7.19(a) the general solution is given by the 
command
rsolve({x(n + 2) – 7/2*x(n + 1) + 3/2*x(n) = 12},x(n));

B = (6/5x(0) + 2/5x(1) −48/5). Given initial conditions x(0) = 1 and x(1) = 1, then
these are incorporated directly in the command
rsolve({x(n + 2) – 7/2*x(n + 1) + 3/2*x(n)

As further examples we consider Examples 7.15(a) and 7.18. For 7.15(a) the
commands
syms x n
maple(‘rsolve({x(n + 1) – 3*x(n) = 4, x(n))’)
return
ans = x(0)*3^n – 2 + 2*3^n
This corresponds to the answer given in the solution with A = (x(0) + 2).
For 7.18 the commands
syms x n
maple(‘rsolve({x(n + 2) – x(n + 1) – x(n)
= 0,x(0) = 1,x(1) = 1, x(n))’)
return
ans = (1/10*5^(1/2) + 1/2)*(1/2 + 1/2*5^(1/2))^n
+ (1/2 – 1/10*5^(1/2))*(1/2 – 1/2*5^(1/2))^n
Simple rearrangement gives
which reduces to the answer given in the solution.
When the roots of the characteristic equation are complex numbers, the general solu-
tion of the homogeneous recurrence relation has a different form, as illustrated in
Example 7.20.
Example 7.20
Show that the general solution of the recurrence relation
xn+2 = 6xn+1 −25xn
may be expressed in the form
xn = 5n(A cos nθ + Bsin nθ)
where θ is such that sinθ =
and cosθ =
.
Solution
The characteristic equation
λ2 = 6λ −25
has the (complex) roots λ = 3 + j4 and λ = 3 −j4, so that we can write the general solution
in the form
xn = A(3 + j4)n + B(3 −j4)n
Now writing the complex numbers in polar form we have
xn = A(re jθ)n + B(re−jθ)n

be simpliﬁed to give
xn = A(5ne jnθ) + B(5ne−jnθ) = A5n(cos nθ + jsinnθ) + B5n(cos nθ −jsinnθ)
= (A + B)5n cos nθ + j(A −B)5n sin nθ
Here A and B are arbitrary complex constants, so their sum and difference are also 
arbitrary constants and we can write
xn = P5n cos nθ + Q5n sin nθ
giving the form required. (Since P and Q are constants we can replace them by A and
B if we wish.)
Example 7.21
Find the solution of the recurrence relation
xn+2 + 2xn = 0
which satisﬁes x0 = 1, x1 = 2.
Solution
Here the characteristic equation is
λ2 + 2 = 0
and has roots ±j÷2, so that we can write the general solution in the form
xn = A(j÷2)n + B(−j÷2)n
Since 
, we can rewrite the solution as
xn = A(÷2)n e jnπ/2 + B(÷2)ne−jnπ/2
We can ﬁnd the values of P and Q by applying the initial data x0 = 1, x1 = 2, giving

If complex roots are involved then using the command evalc alongside rsolve
attempts to express complex exponentials in terms of trigonometric functions, lead-
ing in most cases to simpliﬁed answers. Considering Example 7.21 the MATLAB
commands
syms x n
maple(‘evalc(rsolve({x(n + 2) + 2*x(n) = 0,x(0)
= 1,x(1) = 2}, x(n)))’)
return the answer
2^(1/2*n)*cos(1/2*n*pi) + 2^(1/2*n)*sin(1/2*n*pi)*2^(1/2)
which reduces to
2n/2cos(nπ/2) + 2(n+1)/2sin(nπ/2)
Check that for the equation of Example 7.20 the MATLAB commands
syms x n
maple(‘evalc(rsolve({x(n + 2) – 6*x(n + 1) + 25*x(n)
= 0}, x(n)))’)
subject to noting that exp(n*log5) = 5n, atan(4/3) = θ and the collection of terms,
produce the answer
x(0)5ncos(nθ) + (1/4x(1) – 3/4x(0))5nsin(nθ))
which is of the required form.
The general result corresponding to that obtained in Example 7.18 is that if the roots
of the characteristic equation can be written in the form
λ = u ± jv
where u, v are real numbers, then the general solution of the homogeneous recur-
rence relation is
xn = r n(A cos nθ + Bsin nθ)
where r = ÷(u2 + v2), cosθ = u/r, sinθ = v/r and A and B are arbitrary constants.
Recurrence relations are sometimes called difference equations. This name is used since
we can rearrange the relations in terms of the differences of unknown sequence xn. Thus
xn+1 = axn + b
can be rearranged as
∆xn = (a −1)xn + b
where ∆xn = xn+1 −xn.
Similarly, after some algebraic manipulation, we may write
xn+2 = axn+1 + bxn + c

To ﬁnd a particular solution to (2) substitute a likely form of particular solution into (2). If

the values of the constants in the trial solution. Here are some suitable forms of particular
solutions:

In solving problems, note that the top line of the table involves any known constants (these will
be different from problem to problem), while the bottom line involves unknown constants, 
C, D, E, which must be determined by substituting the trial form into the nonhomogeneous
relation.
An exceptional case arises when the suggested form for pn already is present in the general
solution of the associated homogeneous problem. If this happens, just multiply the suggested
form by n (and if that does not work, by n repeatedly until it does).

A topic from information theory: imagine an
information transmission system that uses an
alphabet consisting of just two symbols ‘dot’ 
and ‘dash’, say. Messages are transmitted by ﬁrst
encoding them into a string of these symbols, and
no other symbols (e.g. blank spaces) are allowed.
Each symbol requires some length of time for its
transmission. Therefore, for a ﬁxed total time
duration only a ﬁnite number of different message
strings is possible. Let Nt denote the number of
different message strings possible in t time units.
(a) Suppose that dot and dash each require one
time unit for transmission. What is the value of
N1? Why is Nt+1 = 2Nt for all t  1? Write down 
a simple formula for Nt for t  1.
(b) Suppose instead that dot requires one unit of
time for transmission while dash requires two units.
What are the values of N1 and N2? Justify the relation
Nt+2 = Nt+1 + Nt for t  1. Hence write down a
formula for Nt in terms of t.
(Hint: The general solution of Fibonacci recurrence
is given in Example 7.18.)

Limit of a sequence
In Section 7.2.1 the idea of a sequence and the associated notation were described. We
shall now develop the concept of a limit of a sequence and then discuss the properties of
sequences that have limits (termed convergent sequences) and methods for evaluating
those limits algebraically and numerically.

502
SEQUENCES, SERIES AND LIMITS
7.5.1
Convergent sequences
In Example 7.6, we obtained the following sequence of approximations (working to
2dp) for ÷2:
x0 = 1,
x1 = 1.83,
x2 = 1.16,
x3 = 1.64
Continuing with the process, we obtain
x22 = 1.41,
x23 = 1.41
and
xn = 1.41
for n  22
The terms x22 and x23 of the sequence are indistinguishable to two decimal places;
in other words, their difference is less than a rounding error. This situation is shown
clearly in Figure 7.4(b). This phenomenon occurs with many sequences, and we say that
the sequence tends to a limit or has a limiting value or converges or is convergent.
While it is clear in the above example what we mean by saying that the sequence con-
verges to ÷2, we need a precise deﬁnition for all the cases that may occur.
In general, a sequence {ak}∞
k=0 has the limiting value a as n becomes large if, given
a small positive number ε (no matter how small), an differs from a by less than ε for all
sufﬁciently large n. More concisely,
an →a as n →∞if, given any ε  0, there is a number N such that 
| an −a |  ε for all n  N
Here the →stands for ‘tends to the value’ or ‘converges to the limit’. An alternative
notation for an →a as n →∞is
Diagrammatically, this means that the terms of the sequence lie between y = a −ε and
y = a + ε for n  N, as shown in Figure 7.8.
Note that the limit of a sequence need not actually be an element of the sequence.
For example {n−1}∞
n=1 has limit 0, but 0 does not occur in the sequence.
Returning to the square-root example discussed above, we have
xn →÷2

It is clear from the terms of the sequence that for an error bound of 0.05 we need 
n  8 (see Figure 7.9). Thus ÷2 = 1.4 (to 1dp). However, to prove convergence in the
formal sense, we have to be able to say how many terms we need to take in order to
obtain a speciﬁed level of precision. Suppose we need an answer correct to 10dp, or
100dp, or whatever; we must be able to give the corresponding value of N in the
deﬁnition of convergence. Finding an expression for N is not often easy.
We shall illustrate the type of methods used by ﬁnding an expression for N for a
classical method for calculating ÷2. This uses the iteration
with x0 = 1
This produces the rational approximations
The last given approximation has an error of less than 0.0001. Suppose we require an
approximation which is correct to p decimal places, then we need to ﬁnd an N such that
| xn −÷2 |  0.5 × 10−p
for n  N. Writing εn = xn −÷2 so that x0 = ÷2 + ε0, x1 = ÷2 + ε1, … , xn+1 = ÷2 + εn+1
(and so on) we have
Multiplying across, we have
(÷2 + εn+1)(1 + ÷2 + εn) = 2 + ÷2 + εn
which gives
÷2 + 2 + ÷2εn + (1 + ÷2)εn+1 + εn+1εn = 2 + ÷2 + εn
Simplifying further we have
(1 + ÷2 + εn)εn+1 = −εn(÷2 −1)
Thus, since xn = ÷2 + εn

Since xn  1 and ÷2  1.5, this implies
|εn+1 | 
|εn |  0.25 |εn|
Since x0 = 1 we have | ε0 | 
, so that |ε1 |  0.25( ), |ε2 |  0.252( ), … and
|εn|  0.25n( ).
Hence if we require | εn |  0.5 × 10−p, for n  N, then we may ﬁnd m such that
0.25m( )  0.5 × 10−p
or
which implies 4m  10 p.
Taking logarithms to base 10, this gives
m  p/log 4
Then choose N to be the greatest integer not greater than m, that is, N = 8p/log 49. Thus,
to guarantee 10dp, we need to evaluate at most 810/log49 = 16 iterations, which you may
verify on your calculator.
7.5.2
Properties of convergent sequences
As we have seen in the ÷2 example, it is usually difﬁcult and tedious to prove the 
convergence of a sequence from ﬁrst principles. Normally we are able to compute the
limit of a sequence from simpler sequences by means of very simple rules based on 
the properties of convergent sequences. These are:
(a) Every convergent sequence is bounded; that is, if {an}∞
n=0 is convergent then
there is a positive number M such that | an |  M for all n.
(b) If {an} has limit a, and {bn} has limit b, then
(i) {an + bn} has limit a + b
(ii) {an −bn} has limit a −b
(iii) {anbn} has limit ab
(iv) {an/bn} has limit a/b, for bn ≠0, b ≠0.
We illustrate the technique in Example 7.22.

(a) With xn = n/(n + 1), we generate the sequence

Alternatively, we write
Now 1/n →0 as n →∞. Hence, by the property (b)(i), 1 + 1/n →1 and so, by the 
property (b)(iv),
as n →∞
as illustrated in Figure 7.10.
(b) For
the easiest approach is to divide both numerator and denominator by the highest power
of n occurring and use the fact that 1/n →0 as n →∞. Thus
The limits of numerator and denominator are 2 and 5 (using the property (b)(i) 
repeatedly), and so xn →
as n →∞(using (b)(iv)). This is shown clearly in 
Figure 7.11.

Deﬁning xn = fn+1/fn gives fn+2 = xn+1 × fn+1 and fn = fn+1/xn, so that the recurrence relation
becomes
xn+1 fn+1 = fn+1 + fn+1/xn
and dividing through by fn+1 we have
xn+1 = 1 + 1/xn
Also, x0 = f1/f0 = 1/1 = 1.
Using the recurrence relation, we obtain the sequence
{1, 2, 1.5, 1.6667, 1.6, 1.625, 1.6154, 1.6190, …}
The numerical results suggest a limiting value near 1.62. Indeed, the oscillatory nature
of the sequence suggests 1.6154  xn  1.6190 for n  8, which implies a limit value
x = 1.62 correct to 2dp.
In this case we can check this conclusion, for if xn →x as n →∞then xn+1 →x also,
and so the recurrence relation yields
,
with x  0
Thus x2 −x −1 = 0, which implies x =
(1 + ÷5) or x =
(1 −÷5). Since the sequence has
positive values only, it is clear that the appropriate root is x =
(1 + ÷5) = 1.62 (to 2dp).
This limiting value is called the golden number and is often denoted by the Greek
letter tau τ. A rectangle the ratio of whose sides is the golden number is said to be the most
pleasing aesthetically, and this has often been adopted by architects as a basis of design.
7.5.3
Computation of limits
The examples considered so far tend to create the impression that all sequences converge,
but this is not so. An important sequence that illustrates this is the geometric sequence
an = rn,
r constant
For this sequence we have
If r  1, the sequence increases without bound as n →∞, and we say it diverges. If 
r = –1, the sequence takes the values −1 and 1 alternately, and there is no limiting value.
If r  −1, the sequence is unbounded and the terms alternate in sign.
Often in computational applications of sequences the limit of the sequence is not
known, so that it is not possible to apply the formal deﬁnition to determine the number
of terms N we need to take in order to obtain a speciﬁed level of precision. If we do not
know the limit a, to which a sequence {an} converges, then we cannot measure |an −a|.
In the computational context, when we apply a recurrence relation to ﬁnd a solution to
a problem, we say that the sequence {an} has converged to its limit when all subsequent
terms yield the same value of the approximation required. In other words, we say that
the sequence of ﬁnite terms is convergent if, for any n and m  N,

where the bound ε is speciﬁed. Thus a sequence tends to a limit if all the terms of the
sequence for n  N are restricted to an interval that can be made arbitrarily small by
choosing N sufﬁciently large. This is called Cauchy’s test for convergence.
In many practical problems we need to ﬁnd a numerical estimate for the limit of 
a sequence. A graphical method for this is to sketch the graph deﬁned by the points
{(1/n, an): n = 1, 2, 3, …} and then extrapolate from it, since 1/n →0 as n →∞. If
greater precision is required than can be obtained in this way, an effective numerical
procedure is a form of repeated linear extrapolation due to Aitken. We illustrate the 
procedure in Example 7.24.
Example 7.24
Examine the convergence of the sequence {an}∞
n=1, an = (1 + 1/n)n.
Solution
It can be shown that 
, but convergence is rather slow. In fact,
a1 = 2,
a2 = 2.2500,
a3 = 2.3704,
a4 = 2.4414,
…
a8 = 2.5658,
… ,
a16 = 2.6379,
… ,
a32 = 2.6770,
…
a64 = 2.6973,
… ,
and
e = 2.7183 to 4dp
Now consider the two terms corresponding to n = 16 and n = 32 and set xn = 1/n. Then 
n = 16
gives
x16 = 0.0625
and
a16 = 2.6379
n = 32
gives
x32 = 0.031 25
and
a32 = 2.6770
We wish to ﬁnd the value corresponding to x = 0. To estimate this, we may use linear
extrapolation, as shown in Figure 7.12. This gives
Note that b16,32 is a better estimate for e than either a16 or a32.

7.6 INFINITE SERIES

7.6
Inﬁnite series
Inﬁnite series occur in a large variety of practical problems, from estimating the long-
term effects of pollution to the stability analysis of the motions of machinery parts. They
also occur in the development of computer algorithms for the numerical solution of
practical problems. In this section we will consider the underlying ideas. Care has to be
exercised when dealing with inﬁnite series, since it is easy to generate fallacious results.
For example, consider the inﬁnite series
S = 1 −2 + 4 −8 + 16 −32 + …
Then we can write
2S = 2 −4 + 8 −16 + 32 −64 + …
and adding these two results, we obtain
3S = 1
or
S =
which is clearly wrong. Such blunders, however, are not always so glaringly obvious,
so we have to develop simple methods for determining whether an inﬁnite series sums
to a ﬁnite value and for obtaining or estimating that value.
7.6.1
Convergence of inﬁnite series
As we discussed in Section 7.2.1, series and sequences are closely connected. When the
sum Sn of a series of n terms tends to a limit as n →∞, the series is convergent. When
we can express Sn in a simple form, it is usually easy to establish whether or not the
series converges. To ﬁnd the sum of an inﬁnite series, the sequence of partial sums {Sn}
is taken to the limit.
Example 7.25
Examine the following series for convergence:
(a) 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + … + (2k + 1) + …
(b) 12 + 22 + 32 + 42 + 52 + … + k2 + …
(c)
(d)
Solution
(a) This is an arithmetic series, so we can write its ﬁnite sum as a simple formula
It is clear from this that Sn →∞as n →∞and the series does not converge to a limit.
It is a divergent series.

(b) As we saw in Example 7.10
Sn = 12 + 22 + 32 + … + n2 =
n(n + 1)(2n + 1)
(n terms)
As n becomes large, so does Sn, and Sn →∞as n →∞. Hence the series is divergent.
(c)
This is a geometric series with common ratio
. Using the formula (7.4) with a = 1 and
r =
gives
As n →∞,
→0, so that Sn →2. Hence the series converges to the sum 2.
(d) We showed in Example 7.11 that
As n →∞, 1/(n + 1) →0, so that Sn →1. Hence the series converges to the sum 1.
Among the elementary series, the geometric series is the most important.
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + … + arn−1
(n terms)
Since r n →0 as n →∞when | r |  1, we conclude that Sn →a/(1 −r) where |r |  1
and the series is convergent. Where | r |  1, the series is divergent. These results are
used in many applications and the sum of the inﬁnite series is

7.6 INFINITE SERIES
511
Summation may be carried out in MATLAB using the symsum command. For
Example 7.25(a) the sum of the ﬁrst n terms is determined by the commands
syms k n
sn = symsum(2*k + 1,0,n)
as
sn = n^2
which tends to inﬁnity as n →∞, so it is a divergent series.
For Example 7.25(d) the sum to inﬁnity is determined by the commands
syms k
sinf = symsum(1/((k + 1)*(k + 2)),0,inf)
as sn = 1, so it is a convergent series.
7.6.2
Tests for convergence of positive series
The convergence or divergence of the series discussed in Example 7.25 was established
by considering the behaviour of the partial sum Sn as n →∞. In many cases, however,
it is not possible to express Sn in a closed form. When this occurs, the convergence or
divergence of the series is established by means of a test. Two tests are commonly used.
(a) Comparison test
Suppose we have a series, ∑
∞
k=0ck, of positive terms (ck  0, all k) which is known 
to be convergent. If we have another series, ∑
∞
k=0uk, of positive terms such that
uk  ck for all k then ∑
∞
k=0uk is convergent also.
Also, if ∑
∞
k=0ck diverges and uk  ck  0 for all k, then ∑
∞
k=0uk also diverges.
Example 7.26
Examine for convergence the series
(a)
(the factorial series)
(b)
(the harmonic series)
Solution
(a) We can establish the convergence of the series (a) by considering its partial sum
Each term of this series is less than or equal to the corresponding term of the series

This geometric series may be summed to give
Thus
which implies that, since all the terms of the series are positive numbers, An tends to a
limit less than 3 as n →∞. Thus the series is convergent.
(b) The divergence of the series (b) is similarly established.
Collecting together successive groups of two, four, eight, … terms, we have
which may be compared with the series
(c)
Each term of the rearranged (b) is greater than or at least equal to the corresponding
term of the series (c), and so the ‘sum’ of the series (b) is greater than the ‘sum’ of the
series (c), which is
on summing the terms in brackets and which is clearly divergent.
Note that the harmonic series is divergent despite the fact that its nth term tends to
zero as n →∞.
The harmonic series is the borderline case for divergence/convergence of the series
For r  1, this series converges; for r  1, it diverges as shown in the table below,
where the values have been calculated using the symsum command (followed by the
double command) in MATLAB’s Symbolic Math Toolbox

The proof of this result is straightforward. Assume that 
and choose 
r to be any number between l and 1. Then since the values of un+1/un, when n is
sufﬁciently large, differ from l by as little as we please, we have
for n  N. Thus
uN+1  ruN,
uN+2  r2uN, …
Thus, from and after the term uN of the series, the terms do not exceed those of the 
convergent geometric series
uN(1 + r + r2 + r3 + … )
Hence ∑
∞
k=0uk converges.
It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that the series diverges when l  1.
Example 7.27
Use d’Alembert’s test to determine whether the following series are convergent.
(a)
(b)
Solution
(a) Let 
then
which tends to zero as n →∞. Thus l = 0 and the series is convergent.
(b) Here
so that the series diverges.
A necessary condition for convergence of all series is that the terms of the series
must tend to zero as n →∞. Thus a simple test for divergence is
if un →u ≠0 as n →∞, then ∑
∞
k=0uk is divergent
Notice, however, that un →0 as n →∞does not guarantee that ∑
∞
k=0uk is convergent.
To prove that, we need more information. (Recall, for example, the harmonic series
of Example 7.26, which is divergent.)

7.6.3
The absolute convergence of general series
In practical problems, we are concerned with series which may have both positive 
and negative terms. Absolutely convergent series are a special case of such series.
Consider the general series
which may have both positive and negative terms uk. If the associated series
is convergent then S is convergent and is said to be absolutely convergent. If it is
impossible to obtain a value for the limit of the partial sum Tn, we must use some other
test to determine the convergence (or divergence) of T. A simple test for absolute 
convergence of a series ∑
∞
k =1uk is a natural extension of d’Alembert’s ratio test.
Absolutely convergent series have the following useful properties:
(a) the insertion of brackets into the series does not alter its sum;
(b) the rearrangment of the series does not alter its sum;
(c) the product of two absolutely convergent series A = ∑an and B = ∑bn is an abso-
lutely convergent series C, where
C = a1b1 + (a2b1 + a1b2) + (a3b1 + a2b2 + a1b3) + (a4b1 + a3b2 + a2b3 + a1b4) + …
There are convergent series that are not absolutely convergent; that is ∑

Power series
Power series frequently occur in the solution of practical problems, as we shall see
in Sections 9.4.2, 9.8 and elsewhere. Often they are used to determine the sensitivity of
systems to small changes in design parameters, to examine whether such systems are
stable when small variations occur (as they always will in real life). The basic mathe-
matics involved in power series is a natural extension of the series considered earlier.
A series of the type
a0 + a1x + a2x 2 + a3x 3 + … + anx n + …
where the a0, a1, a2, … are independent of x is called a power series.
7.7.1
Convergence of power series
Power series will, in general, converge for certain values of x and diverge elsewhere.
Applying d’Alembert’s ratio test to the above series, we see that it is absolutely 
convergent when
Thus the series converges if

7.7 POWER SERIES

Denoting
| an/an+1 | by r, we see that the series is absolutely convergent for 
−r  x  r and divergent for x  −r and x  r. The limit r is called the radius of
convergence of the series. The behaviour at x = ±r has to be determined by other
methods.
The various cases that occur are shown in Example 7.29.
Example 7.29
Find the radius of convergences of the series
(a) 
(b) 
Solution
(a) Here an = 1/n, so that | an/an+1 | = (n + 1)/n and r = 1. Thus the domain of absolute
convergence of the series is −1  x  1. The series diverges for | x |  1 and for x = 1.
At x = −1 the series is
which is convergent to ln
(see Section 7.6.3 and formula (7.18) below). Thus the
series
is convergent for −1  x  1.
(b) Here an = nn and
Now
and
so that an/an+1 →0 as n →∞. Thus the series converges only at x = 0, and diverges
elsewhere.

Special power series
Power series may be added, multiplied and divided within their common domains of 
convergence (provided the denominator is non-zero within this common domain) to
give power series that are convergent, and these properties are often exploited to
express a given power series in terms of standard series and to obtain power series
expansions of complicated functions.
Four elementary power series that are of widespread use are
(a) The geometric series
= 1 −x + x2 −x3 + … + (−1)nxn + …
(−1  x  1)
(7.15)
(b) The binomial series
(7.16)
where
is the binomial coefﬁcient.
In series (7.16) r is any real number. When r is a positive integer, N say, the series
terminates at the term x N and we have the binomial expansion discussed in Chapter 1.
When r is not a positive integer, the series does not terminate.
We can see that setting r = −1 gives
which simpliﬁes to the geometric series
So the geometric series may be thought of as a special case of the binomial series.
Comment
(The series is often written as (1 + x)−1 = 1 −x + x2 −x3 + O(x4), where O(x4) means
terms involving powers of x greater than or equal to 4.)
Similarly,
which simpliﬁes to the arithmetical-geometric series

Thus we see the connection between the binomial and logarithmic series. Note that 
taking x = 1 in series (7.18) we have the result
used in Section 7.6.3.
A summary of the standard series introduced together with some other useful 
series deduced from them is given in Figure 7.13. Note that, using the series expansions
for ex, sinx and cos x given in the ﬁgure, we can demonstrate the validity of Euler’s 
formula
e jx = cos x + jsinx
introduced in equation (3.9). The radius of convergence of all these series may be 
determined using d’Alembert’s test.

SEQUENCES, SERIES AND LIMITS
There is no separate command for power series expansion in either MATLAB 
or MAPLE. However, in MAPLE the command series is more general and can
cope with many situations; it does not tell us how the series is constructed but may
be used for checking answers. As illustrations, for Example 7.30(a) the command
series(1/sqrt(1 – x^2), x = 0);
returns the answer
1 +
1–2x 2 +
3–8x 4 +
5––
16x 6 + O(x8)
and for Example 7.30(c) the command
series(ln(1 + x)/(1 + x), x = 0);
returns the answer
x –
3–2x 2 +
11
––
6 x 3 –
25
––
12x 4 +
137
–––
60 x 5 + O(x 6)
Making use of the maple command the series command may be used in
MATLAB’s Symbolic Math Toolbox. Check that the commands
syms x
maple(‘series((1/sqrt(1 – x^2), x = 0))’)
return the same answer for Example 7.30(a).
Power series are examples of Maclaurin series dealt with later in Section 9.4.2.
They can be obtained using the taylor command taylor(f,n). For example, the
ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the series expansion for Example 7.30(b) are determined by the
commands
syms x
f = 1/((1 – x)*(1 + 3*x));
taylor(f,5);
pretty(ans)
as
1 – 2x + 7x 2 – 20x 3 + 61x4
In MAPLE the commands
series(1/((1 – x)*(1 + 3*x)), x = 0); and
taylor(1/((1 – x)*(1 + 3*x)), x = 0);
produce the answer
1 – 2x + 7x 2 – 20x3 + 61x 4 – 182x 5 + O(x6)
The inverse process of expressing the sum of a power series in terms of the elementary
functions is often difﬁcult or impossible, but when it can be achieved it usually results
in dramatic simpliﬁcation of a practical problem.

7.7 POWER SERIES
523
Example 7.31
Sum the series
(a) 12 + 22x + 32x2 + 42x3 + 52x4 + …
(b) 
Solution
(a) Set
S = 12 + 22x + 32x2 + 42x3 + 52x4 + … + (n + 1)2xn + …
Then
xS = 12x + 22x2 + 32x3 + 42x4 + … + n2xn + …
and subtracting this from S gives
(1 −x)S = 12 + (22 −12)x + (32 −22)x2 + (42 −32)x3 + … + [(n + 1)2 −n2]xn + …
= 1 + 3x + 5x2 + 7x3 + … + (2n + 1)xn + …
= (1 + x + x2 + x3 + … + xn …) + 2(x + 2x2 + 3x3 + … + nxn + …)
= (1 + x + x2 + x3 + … + xn + …) + 2x(1 + 2x + 3x2 + 4x3 + …
+ nxn−1 + …)
The ﬁrst bracket is a geometric series of ratio x and sums to 
| x |  1.
The second bracket is an arithmetico-geometric series of ratio x and sums to
|x|  1 (see Exercises 7.6.4, question 42). Thus
and
(b) Summing this series relies on recognizing its similarity to the series for the hyper-
bolic cosine:
Replacing x by ÷x gives
and thus the series is summed.

Example 7.32
Sum the series
(a) S(λ) =
(b) T(λ) =
and show that
T(λ) −[S(λ)]2 = λ
Solution
(a) By re-writing S(λ) in the form
S(λ) =
and setting n = r −1 we have
S(λ) =
= λe−λeλ, using the result 7.7.2 (c)
= λ
(b) Similarly
T(λ) =
=
=
= λ2eλe−λ + λe−λeλ
= λ2 + λ
Hence
T(λ) −S(λ)2 = λ
These results show that mean and variance of Poisson probability distribution both
equal λ (see Section 13.5.2).
Series may be summed in MATLAB using the symsum command. For Example
(7.31) the series sums are
syms x k
Sa = symsum(k*x^(k – 1),k,1,inf)
giving
Sa = 1/(x – 1)^2
Sb = symsum(x^(k – 1)/’factorial(2*(k – 1))’,k,1,inf)

Commands in MAPLE are the same except for minor syntax differences; use can be
made of (2*(k – 1))! So the command
sum(‘x^(k – 1)/(2*(k – 1))!’, ‘k’ = 1..inﬁnity);
returns the answer cosh(÷x).

Functions of a real variable
So far in this chapter we have concentrated on sequences and series. The terms of a
sequence may be seen as deﬁning a function whose domain is a subset of integers, such
as N. We now turn to the fundamental properties that are essential to mathematical
modelling and problem-solving, but we shall also be developing some basic mathe-
matics that is necessary for later chapters.
7.8.1
Limit of a function of a real variable
The notion of limit can be extended in a natural way to include functions of a real
variable:
A function f(x) is said to approach a limit l as x approaches the value a if, 
given any small positive quantity ε, it is possible to ﬁnd a positive number
δ such that | f(x) −l |  ε for all x satisfying 0  | x −a |  δ.
Less formally, this means that we can make the value of f(x) as close as we please
to l by taking x sufﬁciently close to a. Note that, using the formal deﬁnition, there is 
no need to evaluate f(a); indeed, f(a) may or may not equal l. The limiting value of f as
x →a depends only on nearby values!
Example 7.33
Using a calculator, examine the values of f(x) near x = 0 where

Note that f(x) is not deﬁned where x = 0. At nearby values of x we can calculate f(x),

It seems that as x gets close to the value of 0, f(x) gets close to the value of −2. Indeed,
it can be proved that for 0  | x |  2ε −ε 2, | f(x) + 2 |  ε, so that
Comment
Notice that this is a rather artiﬁcial example to illustrate the idea and theory. In this case
we can rewrite the formula for f(x) to give
which gives
It is clear from this that f(x) →−2 as x →0.
The elementary rules for limits (listed in Section 7.5.2) carry over from those of
sequences, and these enable us to evaluate many limits by reduction to standard cases.
Some common standard limits are
(i)
where r is a real number
(ii)
where x is in radians
(iii)
These results can be deduced from the results of Section 7.7.2. For instance, consider
x r −ar. Since x →a, set x = a + h. Then as x →a, h →0. We have

Expanding (1 + h/a)r by the binomial series (7.16), we have
But x −a = h, so
and letting h →0 yields the result (i)
(When a = 0, the result is obtained trivially.)
The result (ii) is obtained even more simply. The series expansion
gives
A geometric interpretation of (ii) is given in Figure 7.15. OAB is a sector of a circle of
unit radius with angle x (measured in radians). Then

On letting x →0, we have ϕ →0 and (sin ϕ)/ϕ →1, so that
Example 7.35
The volume of a sphere of radius a is 4πa3/3. Show that the volume of material used in
constructing a hollow sphere of interior radius a and exterior radius a + t is
V = 4π(3a2t + 3at2 + t3)/3
Deduce that the surface area of the sphere of radius a is S = 4πa2 and show that it is
equal to the area of the curved surface of the enclosing cylinder.
Solution
The volume V is approximately the surface area S of the interior sphere times the thick-
ness t. That is
V = St + O(t2)
Hence
Now proceeding to the limit as t →0, gives
S = 4πa2
The radius of the enclosing cylinder is a and its height is 2a so that its curved surface
area is
(2πa) × (2a) = 4πa2
as shown in Figure 7.16.

Sketch the graph of the function f(x) where
and show that
does not exist.
Solution
Notice that the function is not deﬁned for x = 0. A sketch of the function is given for 
−1  x  1, x ≠0 in Figure 7.17. From that diagram we see that f(x) →−1 as x →0
from below and f(x) →+1 as x →0 from above. Since the existence of a limit requires
the same value whether we approach from above or below we deduce that
f(x) does
not exist.
Symbolically in MATLAB, limits are determined using the following commands:
f(x) by limit(f,x,a) or limit(f,a)
f(a) by limit(f,x,a, ‘left’)
and
f(a) by limit(f,x,a, ‘right’)
MAPLE deals with the problem in the same way but with minor differences in syntax.

7.9 CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS OF A REAL VARIABLE

7.9
Continuity of functions of a real variable
In Chapter 2 we examined the properties of elementary functions. Often these were
described by means of graphs. A property that is clear from the graphical representa-
tion of a function is that of continuity. Consider the two functions whose graphs are
shown in Figure 7.18. For the function f(x) we can draw the whole curve without lift-
ing the pencil from the paper, but this is not possible for the function g(x). The function
f(x) is said to be continuous everywhere, while g(x) has a discontinuity at x = 0. In
Section 2.8.3, we described several functions that are used to model practical problems
and that have points of discontinuity similar to the function g(x). The most important of
these is Heaviside’s unit function
which has a discontinuity at x = 0.
The formal mathematical deﬁnition of continuity for a function f(x) deﬁned in the
neighbourhood of a point x = x0 and at the point itself is that
f(x) →f(x0)
as x →x0
A function with this property is said to be continuous at x = x0.
Continuous functions have some very special properties, which we shall now list.
7.9.1
Properties of continuous functions
If f(x) is continuous in the interval [a, b] then it has the following properties.
(a) f(x) is a bounded function: there are numbers m and M such that
m  f(x)  M
for all x  [a, b]
Any numbers satisfying this relation are called a lower bound and an upper bound
respectively.
(b) f(x) has a largest and a least value on [a, b]. The least value of f(x) on [a, b] 
is called the minimum of f(x) on [a, b], the largest value is the maximum of f(x) on
[a, b] and the difference between the two is called the oscillation of f(x) on [a, b]. This
is illustrated in Figure 7.19.
(c) f(x) takes every value between its least and its largest value somewhere between 
x = a and x = b. This property is known as the intermediate value theorem.

(d) If a  x1  x2  x3  …  xn  b, there is an X  [a, b] such that
This property is known as the average value theorem.
(e) Given ε  0, the interval [a, b] can be divided into a number of intervals in each of
which the oscillation of the function is less than ε.
(f) Given ε  0, there is a subdivision of [a, b], a = x0  x1  x2  …  xn = b, such
that in each subinterval (xi, xi+1)
That is, by making a subtabulation that is sufﬁciently ﬁne, we can represent f(x) locally
by linear interpolation to within any prescribed error bound.
(g) Given ε  0, f(x) can be approximated on the interval [a, b] by a polynomial of
suitable degree such that
| f(x) −pn(x)|  ε
for x  [a, b]
This is known as the Weierstrass theorem. Note, however, that the theorem does not
tell us how to obtain pn(x).
The properties of limits listed in Section 7.5.2 enable us to determine the continuity
of functions formed by combining continuous functions. Thus if f(x) and g(x) are 
continuous functions then so are the functions
(a)
af(x), where a is a constant
(b)
f(x) + g(x)
(c)
f(x)g(x)
(d)
f(x)/g(x), except where g(x) = 0
Also the composite function f(g(x)) is continuous at x0 if g(x) is continuous at x0 and
f(x) is continuous at x = g(x0).
Some of the properties of continuous functions are illustrated in Example 7.37 and
in Exercises 7.9.4.

Show that f(x) = 2x/(1 + x2) for x   is continuous on its whole domain. Find its

7.9 CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS OF A REAL VARIABLE
535
Solution
The graph of the function is shown in Figure 7.20, from which we can see that the part
shown is a continuous curve. That is to say, we can put a pencil at point A at the left-hand
end of the graph and trace along the whole length of the curve to reach the point B at the
right-hand end without lifting the pencil from the page. We can prove this more formally
as follows. Select any point x0 of the domain of the function. Then we have to show that
| f(x) −f(x0) | can be made as small as we please by taking x sufﬁciently close to x0. Now
→0
as x →x0
This implies that f(x) is continuous at x0, and since x0 is any point of the domain, it 
follows that f(x) is continuous for all x.
Then to show that the function takes a given value y we have to solve the equation
y = f(x) for x in terms of y. So that in this example
gives
yx2 −2x + y = 0
where we are now solving the equation for x in terms of y. Hence we obtain
y ≠0 and −1  y  1
This gives two values of x for each y  (−1, 1), y ≠0. Clearly y = 0 is also attained
for x = 0. The maximum and minimum values for y are 1 and −1 respectively, and the
corresponding values of x are 1 and −1. Thus f(x) is a continuous function on its
domain, and it attains its maximum and minimum values and every value in between.
7.9.2
Continuous and discontinuous functions
The technique used to show that f(x) is a continuous function in Example 7.37 can 
be used to show that polynomials, rational functions (except where the denominator is
zero) and many transcendental functions are continuous on their domains. We frequently
make use of the properties of continuous functions unconsciously in problem-solving!
For example, in solving equations we trap the root between two points x1 and x2 where
f(x1)  0 and f(x2)  0 and conclude that the root we seek lies between x1 and x2. The

need for continuity here is shown by the graph of y = tan−1(1/x) (Figure 7.21). There is
no value of x corresponding to y = 0, despite the facts that tan−1(1/0.01) is positive and
tan−1[1/(−0.01)] is negative.
Similarly, when locating the maximum or minimum value of a function y = f(x), in
many practical situations we would be content with a solution that yields a value close
to the true optimum value, and property (e) above tells us we can make that value as
close as we please. Sometimes we use the continuity idea to ﬁll in ‘gaps’ in function
deﬁnitions. A simple example of this is f(x) = (sin x)/x for x ≠0. This function is deﬁned
everywhere except at x = 0. We can extend it to include x = 0 by insisting that it be 
continuous at x = 0. Since (sin x)/x →1 as x →0, deﬁning f(x) as
(7.19)
yields a function with no ‘gaps’ in its domain. The function f(x) in (7.19) is known as
the sinc function; that is,
and its graph is drawn in Figure 7.22. This function has important applications in 
engineering, particularly in digital signal analysis. See the chapter on Fourier trans-
forms in the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.
Of course it is not always possible to ﬁll in ‘gaps’ in function deﬁnitions. The function
(x ≠nπ, n = 0, ±1, ±2, … )
can have its domain extended to include the points x = nπ, but it will always have a 
discontinuity at those points (except perhaps x = 0). Thus
yields a function that is deﬁned everywhere but is discontinuous at an inﬁnite set of points.

7.9 CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS OF A REAL VARIABLE
537
In the analysis of practical problems we frequently use functions that have different
formulae on different parts of their domain. For example, consider a beam of length l
that is freely hinged at both ends and carries a concentrated load W at x = a, as shown
in Figure 7.23. Then the shear force F is given by
and is sketched in Figure 7.24(a).
The bending moment M is
and is sketched in Figure 7.24(b). (The terms ‘shear force’ and ‘bending moment’ are
discussed in the next chapter in Example 8.7.)
Notice here that F has a ﬁnite discontinuity at x = a while M is continuous there.
7.9.3
Numerical location of zeros
Many practical engineering problems may involve the determination of the points at
which a function takes a speciﬁc value (often zero) or the points at which it takes its
maximum or minimum values. There are many different numerical procedures for solving
such problems and we shall illustrate the technique by considering its application to the
analysis of structural vibration.
This is a very common problem in engineering. To avoid resonance effects, it is 
necessary to calculate the natural frequencies of vibration of a structure. For a beam
built in at one end and simply supported at the other, as shown in Figure 7.25, the 
natural frequencies are given by

A beam built in at 
one end and simply
supported at the other.

where l is the length of the beam, E is Young’s modulus, I is the moment of inertia of
the beam about its neutral axis, ρ is its density and θ satisﬁes the equation
tan θ = tanhθ
We can ﬁnd approximate values for θ that satisfy the above equation by means of a
graph, as shown in Figure 7.26. From the diagram it is clear that the roots occur just
before the points θ = 0, π, 
π, 
π, … . Using a calculator, we can compare the values
of tanθ and tanhθ, to produce the table of Figure 7.27, which gives us the estimate for
the root near θ =
π as 3.925 ± 0.005.
If we require a more precise answer than this provides, we can resort to a ﬁner 
subtabulation. In some problems this can be very tedious and time-consuming. A better
strategy is to use an interval-halving or bisection method. We know that the root lies
between θ1 = 3.92 and θ2 = 3.93. We work out the value of the functions at the midpoint
of this interval, θ3 = 3.925, and determine whether the root lies between θ1 and θ3 or
between θ3 and θ2. The process is then repeated on the subinterval that contains the root,
and so on until sufﬁcient precision is obtained.
The process is set out in tabular form in Figure 7.28. Note the renaming of the end
points of the root-bracketing interval at each step, so that the interval under scrutiny is
always denoted by [θ1, θ2]. After ﬁve applications we have θ = 3.926 72 ± (0.005/25).
A reﬁnement of the bisection method is the method of false position (also known
as regula falsa). To solve the equation f(x) = 0, given x1 and x2 such that f(x1)  0
and f(x2)  0 and f(x) is continuous in (x1, x2), the bisection method takes the point

(x1 + x2) as the next estimate of the root. The method of false position uses linear 
interpolation to derive the next estimate of the root. The straight line joining the points
(x1, f(x1)) and (x2, f(x2)) is given by
This line cuts the x axis where
so this is the new estimate of the root. This method usually converges more rapidly than
the bisection method. The computation of the root of tan θ −tanh θ = 0 in the interval
(3.92, 3.93) is shown in Figure 7.29. Notice how, as a result of the ﬁrst step, the
estimate of the root is θ = 3.926 580 and f(3.926580) = 0.000045. The root is now
bracketed in the interval (3.926580, 3.93), and the method is repeated. In two steps we
have an estimate of the root giving a value of f(θ)  10−6. This obviously converges
much faster than the bisection method.
Both the bisection method and the method of false position are bracketing methods
– the root is known to lie in an interval of steadily decreasing size. As such, they are
guaranteed to converge to a solution. An alternative method of solution for an equation
f(x) = 0 is to devise a scheme producing a convergent sequence whose limit is the root
of the equation. Such ﬁxed point iteration methods are based on a relation of the form
xn+1 = g(xn). If 
xn = α, say, then evidently α = g(α). The simplest way to devise an 
iterative scheme for the solution of an equation f(x) = 0 is to ﬁnd some rearrangement
of the equation in the form x = g(x). Then, if the scheme xn+1 = g(xn) converges, the limit
will be a root of f(x) = 0.
We can arrange the equation tan θ = tanh θ in the form
θ = tan−1(tanh θ) + kπ
(k = 0, ±1, ±2, … )
If we take k = 1 and θ0 =
we obtain, using the iteration scheme,
θn = tan−1(tanh θn−1) + π
the sequence
θ0 = 3.926 991,
θ1 = 3.926 603,
θ2 = 3.926 602,
θ3 = 3.926 602
and the root is θ = 3.926602 to 6dp. (Taking other values of k will, of course, give
schemes that converge to other roots of tan θ = tanhθ.)
The disadvantage of such iterative schemes is that not all of them converge. We shall
return to this topic in Section 9.3.2.

Engineering application: approximating functions and
Padé approximants
In Section 2.9.1 we introduced linear and quadratic interpolation as a means of obtaining
estimates of the values of functions in between known values. Often in engineering
applications it is of considerable importance to obtain good approximations to functions.
In this section we shall show how what we have learned about power series representa-
tion can be used to produce a type of approximate representation of a function widely
used by engineers, for example, when approximating exponentials by rational functions
in modelling time delays in control systems. The approach is attributed to Padé and is
based on the matching of series expansion.

Solution
Assuming an exact match at x = 0, we deduce at once that a = A. Also, we know that
1/ex = e−x, and assuming a similar relation for the approximation
This holds if we choose A = a (as above), B = −b and C = c, giving
We can see from this that it would be possible to express both sides of the equation as
power series in x (at least in a restricted domain). We can rewrite the approximation to
make it exact:
(A + Bx + Cx2)e−x = (A −Bx + Cx2) + px3 + qx4 + rx5 + …
where p, q, … are to be found.
Replacing e−x by its power series representation, we have
= A −Bx + Cx2 + px3 + qx4 + rx5 + . . .
Multiplying out the left-hand side and collecting terms, we obtain
= A −Bx + Cx2 + px3 + qx4 + rx5 + …
Comparing the coefﬁcients of like powers of x on either side of this equation gives
A = A

and so on.
We see from this that there is not a unique solution for A, B and C, but that we may
choose them (or some of them) arbitrarily. Taking A = 1 gives B =
and 
−C = p.
Setting p = 0 will make the error term smaller near x = 0, so we adopt that choice, 
giving C =

The principal term of the error, −
x5, enables us to decide the domain of usefulness
of the approximation. For example, if we require an approximation correct to 4dp, we
need 
x5 to be less then 
× 10−4. Thus the approximation
yields answers correct to 4dp for | x |  0.51.
This particular approximation is used by control engineers to enable them to apply
linear systems techniques to the analysis and design of systems characterizing a time
delay in their dynamics. Since the degree of both the numerator and denominator is 2,
this is referred to as the (2, 2) Padé approximant.
As an extended exercise, the reader should obtain the following (1, 1) and (3, 3) Padé
approximants:

There are two methods of assessing the value of a
wasting asset. The ﬁrst assumes that it decreases
each year by a ﬁxed amount; the second assumes
that it depreciates by a ﬁxed percentage.
A piece of equipment costs £1000 and has a
‘lifespan’ of six years after which its scrap value is
£100. Estimate the value of the equipment by both
methods for the intervening years.
2
A machine that costs £1000 has a working life 
of three years, after which it is valueless and has 
to be replaced. It saves the owner £500 per year
while it is in use. Show that the true total saving
£S to the owner over the three years is
−1000
where r% is the current rate of interest. Estimate S
for r = 5, 10, 15 and 20. When does the machine
truly save the owner money?

Introduction
Many of the practical situations that engineers have to analyse involve quantities that
are varying. Whether it is the temperature of a coolant, the voltage on a transmission
line or the torque on a turbine blade, the mathematical tools for performing such ana-
lyses are the same. One of the most successful of these is calculus, which involves two
fundamental operations: differentiation and integration. Historically, integration was
discovered ﬁrst, and indeed some of the ideas and results date back over 2000 years to
when the Greeks developed the method of exhaustion to evaluate the area of a region
bounded on one side by a curve – a method used by Archimedes (287–212 BC) to obtain
the exact formula for the area of a circle. Differentiation was discovered very much
later, during the seventeenth century, in relation to the problem of determining the tan-
gent at an arbitrary point on a curve. Its characteristic features were probably ﬁrst used
by Fermat in 1638 to ﬁnd the maximum and minimum points of some special functions.
He noticed that tangents must be horizontal at some points, and developed a method 
for ﬁnding them by slightly changing the variable in a single algebraic equation and
then letting the change ‘disappear’. The connection between the two processes of deter-
mining the area under a curve and obtaining a tangent at a point on a curve was ﬁrst
realized in 1663 by Barrow, who was Newton’s professor at the University of Cambridge.
However, it was Newton (1642–1727) and Leibniz (1646–1716), working independently,
who fully recognized the implications of this relationship. This led them to develop 
the calculus as a way of dealing with change and motion. Exploitation of their work
resulted in an era of tremendous mathematical activity, much of which was motivated
by the desire to solve applied problems, particularly by Newton, whose accomplish-
ments were immense and included the formulation of the laws of gravitation. The 
calculus was put on a ﬁrmer mathematical basis in the nineteenth century by Cauchy
and Riemann. It remains today one of the most powerful mathematical tools used by
engineers. In this chapter and the next we shall review its basic ideas and techniques,
refreshing some prior knowledge of the reader and extending it, and show their appli-
cation both in the formulation of mathematical models of practical problems and in
their solution.
In recent years we have seen signiﬁcant developments in symbolic algebra pack-
ages, such as MAPLE and the Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB, which are 
capable of performing algebraic manipulation, including the calculation of derivatives
and integrals. To the inexperienced, this development may appear to eliminate the 
need for engineers to be able to carry out even basic operations in calculus by hand.
This, however, is far from the truth. If engineers are to apply the powerful techniques
associated with the calculus to the design and analysis of industrial problems then 
it is essential that they have a sound grounding of differentiation and integration. 
First, this allows effective formulation, comprehension and analysis of mathematical
models. Secondly, it provides the basis for understanding symbolic algebra packages,
particularly when speciﬁc forms of results are desired. In order to acquire this under-
standing it is necessary to have a certain degree of ﬂuency in the manipulation of 
associated basic techniques. It is the objective of this chapter and the next to provide
the minimum requirements for this. At the same time, students should be given the
opportunity to develop their skills in the use of a symbolic algebra package and, when-
ever appropriate, be encouraged to check their answers to the exercises using such a
package.

Differentiation
Here we shall introduce the concept of differentiation and illustrate its role in some
problem-solving and modelling situations.
8.2.1
Rates of change
Consider an object moving along a straight line with constant velocity u (in ms−1).
The distance s (in metres) travelled by the object in time t (in seconds) is given by the
formula s = ut. The distance–time graph of this motion is the straight line shown in
Figure 8.1. Note that the velocity u is the rate of change of distance with respect to time,
and that on the distance–time graph it is the gradient (slope) of the straight line repres-
enting the relationship between the distance travelled and the time elapsed. This, of
course, is a special case where the velocity is constant and the distance travelled is a
linear function of time. Even when the velocity varies with time, however, it is still
given by the gradient of the distance–time graph, although it then varies from point to
point along the curve.
Figure 8.1
Distance–time graph
for constant velocity u.
Consider the distance–time graph shown in Figure 8.2(a). Suppose we wish to ﬁnd
the velocity at the time t = t1. The velocity at t = t1 is given by the gradient of the graph
at t = t1. To ﬁnd that we can enlarge that piece of the graph near t = t1, as shown in
Figure 8.2(b) and (c). We recall that continuous functions have the property that locally
they may be approximated by linear functions (see Section 7.9.1, property f). We see
that as we increase the magniﬁcation, that is, zooming closer, the graph takes on the

and (c) enlargement 
of inner rectangle
surrounding (t1, s1).

appearance of a straight line through the point P(t1, s1). The gradient of that straight line
(in the limit) gives us the gradient of the graph at P. Consider that section of the graph
contained in the rectangle whose sides parallel to the s axis are t = t1 + h and t = t1 −h
where h is a positive (small) number, as shown in Figure 8.3. If we denote the function
relating distance and time by f(t), then s1 = f(t1) and we can approximate the gradient
of the function f(t) at the point P by the gradients of either of the chords AP or BP. Thus
gradient
As h becomes smaller and smaller (corresponding to greater and greater magniﬁcations)
these approximations become better and better, so that in the limit (h →0) they cease
being approximations and become exact. Thus we may write
(gradient of f(t) at t = t1) =
Here we speciﬁed h  0, which means that the former limit is the limit from above and
the latter is the limit from below of the expression
where ∆t →0. (Here we have used the composite symbol ∆t to indicate a small change
in the value of t. It may be positive or negative.) So provided that the limits from above
and below have the same value, the gradient of the function f(t) is deﬁned at t = t1 by
8.2.2
Deﬁnition of a derivative
Formally we deﬁne the derivative of the function f(x) at the point x to be
where ∆f = f(x + ∆x) −f(x) is the change in f(x) corresponding to the change ∆x in x.

mental change in the independent variable x and ∆f is the corresponding incremental
change in f(x). P and Q are the points on the graph with coordinates (x, f(x)), (x + ∆x,
f(x + ∆x)) respectively. The slope of the line segment PQ is
In the limit as ∆x tends to zero the point Q approaches P, and the line segment becomes

Example 8.2
Consider the function f(x) = 25x −5x2. Find
(a) the derivative of f(x) from ﬁrst principles;
(b) the rate of change of f(x) at x = 1;
(c) the equation of the tangent to the graph of f(x) at the point (1, 20);
(d) the equation of the normal to the graph of f(x) at the point (1, 20).
Solution
(a) f(x) = 25x −5x2
f(x + ∆x) = 25(x + ∆x) −5(x + ∆x)2 = 25x + 25∆x −5x2 −10x ∆x −5(∆x)2
so that
Thus the derivative of f(x) is
(b) The rate of change of f(x) at x = 1 is f ′(1) = 15.
(c) The slope of the tangent to the graph of f(x) at (1, 20) is f′(1) = 15. Remembering
from equation (1.14) that the equation of a line passing through a point (x1, y1) and hav-
ing slope m is
y −y1 = m(x −x1)
we have the equation of the tangent to the graph of y = f(x) at (1, 20) is
y −20 = 15(x −1)
or
y = 15x + 5
(d) The slope n of the normal to the graph is given by the relation mn = −1, where m is
the slope of the tangent. This is illustrated in Figure 8.5. Thus in this example the slope
of the normal at (1, 20) is −1/15 and hence the equation of the normal at (1, 20) is

8.2.4
Differentiable functions
The formal deﬁnition of the derivative of f(x) implies that the limits from below 
and above are equal. In some cases this does not happen. For example, the function 
f(x) = ÷(1 + sin x) is such that its two limits are
Clearly the derivative of the function is not deﬁned at x = 3π/2 (the two limits above
are sometimes referred to as ‘left-hand’ and ‘right-hand’ derivatives, respectively).
The graph of y = ÷(1 + sin x) is shown in Figure 8.6, and it is clear that at x = 3π/2
a unique tangent cannot be drawn to the graph of the function. This is not surprising
since from the interpretation of the derivative as the slope of the tangent, it follows that
for a function f(x) to be differentiable at x = a, the graph of f(x) must have a unique,
non-vertical well-deﬁned tangent at x = a. Otherwise the limit
does not exist. We say that a function f(x) is differentiable if it is differentiable at all
points in its domain. For practical purposes it is sufﬁcient to interpret a differentiable
function as one having a smooth continuous graph with no sharp corners. Engineers 
frequently refer to such functions as being ‘well behaved’. Clearly the function having
the graph shown in Figure 8.7(a) is differentiable at all points except x = x1 and x = x2,
since a unique tangent cannot be drawn at these points. Similarly, the function having
the graph shown in Figure 8.7(b) is differentiable at all points except at x = 0.

Speed, velocity and acceleration
Considering the motion of the object in Section 8.2.1 enables us to distinguish between
the terms speed and velocity. In everyday usage we talk of speed rather than velocity,
and always regard it as being positive or zero. As we saw in Chapter 4, velocity is a
vector quantity and has a direction associated with it, while speed is a scalar quantity,
being the magnitude or modulus of the velocity. When s and v are measured horizont-
ally, the object will have a positive velocity when travelling to the right and a negative
velocity when travelling to the left. Throughout its motion, the speed of the particle will
be positive or zero. Likewise, acceleration a, being the rate of change of velocity with
respect to time, is a vector quantity and is determined by
Example 8.3
A particle is thrown vertically upwards into the air. Its height s (in m) above the ground
after time t (in seconds) is given by
s = 25t −5t2
(a) What height does the particle reach?
(b) What is its velocity when it returns to hit the ground?
(c) What is its acceleration?
Solution
Since velocity v is rate of change of distance s with time t we have
In this particular example
s(t) = 25t −5t2
(8.3)
so, from Example 8.2,
(8.4)
(a) When the particle reaches its maximum height, it will be momentarily at rest, so
that its velocity will be momentarily zero. From (8.4) this will occur when t = 25/10 = 2.5.
Then, from (8.3), the height reached at this instant is
That is, the maximum height reached by the particle is 31.25m.
(b) First we need to ﬁnd the time at which the particle will return to hit the ground. This
will occur when the height s is again zero, which from (8.3) is when t = 5. Then, from
(8.4), the velocity of the particle when it hits the ground is

basic operations of calculus and many of these will be introduced in this chapter. 
If y = f(x) then we denote dy/dx by dy or df (we could use any name such as, for
example, dydx or dybydx). Denoting ∆x by h the derivative of f(x), as given in (8.1),
is determined by the commands

f:= x –> f(x);

syms h x
df = limit(((25*(x + h) – 5*(x + h)^2) –

Mathematical modelling using derivatives
We have seen that the gradient of a tangent to the graph y = f(x) can be expressed as a
derivative, but derivatives have much wider application than just this. Any quantity that
can be expressed as a limit of the form (8.1) can be represented by a derivative, and such
quantities arise in many practical situations. Because gradients of tangents to graphs
can be expressed as derivatives, it follows that we can always interpret a derivative 
geometrically as the slope of a tangent to a graph. In Example 8.3 we saw that the 
particle reached its maximum height 31.25 m when t = 2.5 s. This maximum height
occurred when v = ds/dt = 0. This implies that the tangent to the graph of distance
against time was horizontal. In general at a maximum or minimum of a function, its
derivative is zero and its tangent horizontal (as discussed in Section 2.2.1). This is dis-
cussed fully later, in Section 8.5.
Example 8.4
Suppose that a tank initially contains 80litres of pure water. At a given instant (taken
to be t = 0) a salt solution containing 0.25kg of salt per litre ﬂows into the tank at a rate
of 8litres min−1. The liquid in the tank is kept homogeneous by constant stirring. Also,
at time t = 0 liquid is allowed to ﬂow out from the tank at a rate of 12litresmin−1. Show
that the amount of salt x(t) (in kg) in the tank at time t (min)  0 is determined by the
mathematical model
(t  20)
Solution
The situation is illustrated in Figure 8.8. Since x(t) denotes the amount of salt in the 
tank at time t  0, the rate of increase of the amount of salt in the tank is dx/dt, and is
given by

= rate of inﬂow of salt – rate of outﬂow of salt
(8.5)
The rate of inﬂow of salt is (0.25kglitre−1) (8litresmin−1) = 2 kg min−1.
The rate of outﬂow of salt is c × (rate of outﬂow of liquid) = c × 12litresmin−1
= 12c
(in kgmin−1)
where c(t) is the concentration of salt in the tank (in kglitre−1). The concentration at
time t is given by
After time t (in min) 8t litres have entered the tank and 12t litres have left. Also, at 
t = 0 there were 80 litres in the tank. Therefore the volume V of liquid in the tank at
time t is given by
V(t) = 80 −(12t −8t) = (80 −4t)
(Note that V(t)  0 only if t  20min; after this time the liquid will ﬂow out as quickly
as it ﬂows in and none will accumulate in the tank.) Thus the concentration c(t) is given by
so that
rate of outﬂow of salt =
Substituting back into (8.5) gives the rate of increase as
or
This equation involving the derivative of x(t) is called a differential equation, and in
Question 9 of Review Exercises 10.13 we shall show how it can be solved to give the
quantity x(t) of salt in the tank at time t.
Example 8.5
In a suspension bridge a roadway, of length 2l, is suspended by vertical hangers from
cables carried by towers at the ends of the span, as illustrated in Figure 8.9(a). The 
lowest points of the cables are a distance h below the top of the supporting towers. Find
an equation which represents the line shape of the cables.
Solution
To solve this problem we have to make some simplifying assumptions. We assume 
that the roadway is massive compared to the cables, so that the weight W of the roadway
is the dominant factor in determining the shape of the cables. Secondly, we assume

that the weight of the roadway is uniformly distributed along its length, and if the 
hangers are equally spaced they can be adjusted in length so that they carry equal 
vertical loads.
We solve this problem using elementary statics because at each point P(x, y) on the 
cable the forces are in equilibrium. Figure 8.9(b) shows the forces acting on the part of
the cable between A and P. These are the weight W1 of the roadway between C and Q
(W1 = Wx/2l, where x = CQ), the tension T in the cable acting at the angle α at A and
the tension S in the cable acting at the angle θ at P.
Resolving forces horizontally, we have T cosα = S cosθ
Resolving forces vertically, we have T sinα + S sinθ =
Eliminating S between these equations gives T sinα + T cosα tan θ =
Also, we know that the total weight W of the roadway is supported by the tensions
at A and B, so that 2T sinα = W. Hence, substituting, we obtain
giving
Now tanθ is the slope of the curve at P (the tensions act along the direction of the 
tangent at each point of the curve), so that

is the right-hand side of (8.6). In this case we can make use of the results of Example
8.1, since we know that
(which implies

and
(mx + c) = m
Applying these results to (8.6), we see that
(8.7)
where c is a constant. We can ﬁnd the value of c because we know that y = h at x = 0.
Substituting x = 0 into (8.7), we see that c = h, and the solution becomes
(8.8)
But we also know that y = 0 where x = l. This enables us to ﬁnd the value of tan α.
Substituting x = l into (8.8), we have
0 =
l tanα −l tanα + h
which implies tan α = 2h/l. Thus the shape of the supporting cable is given by
= h(x −l)2/l2
indicating that the points of attachment of the hangers to the cable lie on a parabolic curve.
Example 8.6
A radio telescope has the shape of a paraboloid of revolution (see Figure 1.23). Show
that all the radio waves arriving in a direction parallel to its axis of symmetry are
reﬂected to pass through the same point on that axis of symmetry.
Solution
The diagram in Figure 8.10 shows a section of the paraboloid through its axis of
symmetry. We choose the coordinate system such that the equation of the parabola
shown is y = x2. Let AP represent the path of a radio signal travelling parallel to the
y axis. At P it is reﬂected to pass through the point B on the y axis. The laws of
reﬂection state that ∠APN = ∠BPN, where PN is the normal to the curve at P. Now
given the coordinates (a, a2) of the point P we have to ﬁnd the coordinates (0, b) of the
point B. From the diagram we can see that if ∠PTQ = θ, then ∠PQT = π/2 −θ, which
implies that ∠ONP = θ. Since AP is parallel to NB, we see that ∠APN = θ and hence
∠BPN = θ. This implies that ∠PBN = π −2θ. With all of these angles known we can
calculate the coordinates of B. From the diagram

Example 8.7
Show that the shear force F acting in a beam is related to the bending moment M by
Solution
This was brieﬂy discussed in Section 7.9.2. We now explore the ideas more thoroughly.
A beam is a horizontal structural member which carries loads. These induce forces 
and stresses inside the beam in transmitting the loads to the supports. For design safety
two internal quantities are used, the shear force F and the bending moment M. At each
point along the beam the forces are in equilibrium. These forces can be thought of as
acting along the beam and (vertically) perpendicular to it. When a beam bends, its upper
surface is compressed and its lower surface is stretched, so that forces on the upper and
lower surfaces at any point along the beam are acting in opposite directions. There will,
of course, be a line within the beam, which is neither stretched nor compressed. This is
the neutral axis. The situation is illustrated in Figure 8.11(a). To analyse the situation

we imagine cutting the beam at a point P along its length and examine the forces which
are necessary there to keep it in equilibrium. The opposing horizontal forces at P, give
a moment M about the neutral axis, as shown in Figure 8.11(b). This is called the bend-
ing moment. As the beam is in equilibrium there will be an equal and opposite bend-
ing moment on the other side of our imaginary cut. In the same way the vertical forces
F balance at the cut. This vertical force is called the shear force. The shear force and
bending moment are important in considering design safety.
We ﬁnd the shear force F at a point distance x from the left-hand end of the beam
by considering the vertical equilibrium of forces for the left-hand portion of the beam,
and we ﬁnd the bending moment M by looking at the balance of moments of force for
that left-hand portion (see Figure 8.12(a)). The force F is the sum of the forces acting
vertically on AP, and M is the sum of moments.
Consider the small element of the beam of length ∆x between P and Q shown in
Figure 8.12(b). Then examining the balance of moments about Q we see that

Solution
Boxes like these are used commercially for food sales. Packaging is expensive, so that
manufacturers often try to design a container that has the biggest capacity for a standard
size of cardboard. An A4 sheet has size 210 × 297mm.
Allowing 10mm ﬂaps as stiffeners, shaded in the diagram, and denoting the length,
breadth and height by l, b and h (in mm) respectively, we have
l + 4h + 20 = 297
b + 4h + 20 = 210
and the capacity C is l × b × h mm3. Thus
C(h) = (277 −4h)(190 −4h)h = 52 630h −1868h2 + 16h3
The maximum capacity C* occurs where C′(h) = 0.

It can be shown from ﬁrst principles, see Question 5 of Exercises 8.2.6, that the
general cubic function
f(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d
has derivative
f ′(x) = 3ax2 + 2bx + c
In this example a = 16, b = −1868, c = 52 630, d = 0 and x = h. Thus
C′(h) = 52 630 −3736h + 48h2
so that the value h* of h which yields the maximum capacity is h* = 18.47 where
C′(h*) = 0. We can verify that it is a maximum by showing that
C′(18.4)  0
and
C′(18.5)  0

Techniques of differentiation
In this section we shall obtain the derivatives of some basic functions from ‘ﬁrst prin-
ciples’, that is, using the deﬁnition of a derivative given in (8.1), and will show how we
obtain the derivatives of other functions using the basic results and some elementary
rules. The rules themselves may be derived from the basic deﬁnition of the differentiation

process. In practice, we make use of a very few basic facts, which, together with the
rules, enable us to differentiate a wide variety of functions.
8.3.1
Basic rules of differentiation
To enable us to exploit the basic derivatives as we obtain them, we will ﬁrst obtain the
rules which make that exploitation possible. These rules you should know ‘by heart’.
Rule 1 (constant multiplication rule)
If y = f(x) and k is a constant then
Rule 2 (sum rule)
If u = f(x) and v = g(x) then
Rule 3 (product rule)
If u = f(x) and v = g(x) then
Rule 4 (quotient rule)
If u = f(x) and v = g(x) then
Rule 5 (composite-function or chain rule)
If z = g(x) and y = f(z), then
Rule 6 (inVerse-function rule)
If y = f −1(x), then x = f(y) and

Rule 7 (parametric differentiation rule)
If y = f(x) where x = g(t) and y = h(t) and t is a parameter, then
Veriﬁcation of rules
Rule 1 follows directly from the deﬁnition given in (8.1), for if
g(x) = kf(x),
k constant
g(x + ∆x) = kf(x + ∆x)
and
∆g = g(x + ∆x) −g(x) = k[ f(x + ∆x) −f(x)]
so that
using the properties of limits given in Section 7.5.2.
Likewise, for Rule 2, if
h(x) = f(x) + g(x)
h(x + ∆x) = f(x + ∆x) + g(x + ∆x)
and
∆h = h(x + ∆x) −h(x) = [ f(x + ∆x) −f(x)] + [g(x + ∆x) −g(x)]
so that

To verify Rule 3 consider Figure 8.16. For any value of x, the area y of the rectangle
ABCD is
y = u(x)v(x)
Increasing x by the increment ∆x changes u and v by amounts ∆u and ∆v respectively,
giving
u(x + ∆x) = u(x) + ∆u
and
v(x + ∆x) = v(x) + ∆v
From the diagram we see that the corresponding increment in y is given by
∆y = area EFCB + area CHJD + area CFGH
= u ∆v + v ∆u + ∆u ∆v
so that
leading to the result
= u(x)v′(x) + u′(x)v(x)
since ∆u and ∆v →0 as ∆x →0.
Rule 4 may then be deduced from Rule 3, for if
where u = f(x) and v = g(x), then u = yv and Rule 3 gives
on substituting for y
Rearranging then gives the required result
Rule 5 will be veriﬁed in Section 8.3.6, Rule 6 in Section 8.3.7 and Rule 7 in Section
8.3.14.

Derivative of xr

Solution
(a) Using Rule 1 and result (8.9) with r = 4, we have

Similarly

Using Rule 2, we have
(8x4 −4x2) = 32x3 −8x
(b) Using the result (8.9) with Rules 1 and 2, we obtain

and

Taking u = 2x2 + 5 and v = x2 + 3x + 1 in Rule 3, we obtain
[(2x2 + 5)(x2 + 3x + 1) ] = 4x(x2 + 3x + 1) + (2x2 + 5)(2x + 3)

Alternatively, we could write f(x) = 4x9 −12x8 giving f ′(x) = 36x8 −96x7 directly. It is
important to look at expressions carefully before applying the rules. Sometimes there
are quicker routes to the solution.
(d) Multiplying out we have
f(x) = x÷x + ÷x = x 3/2 + x1/2
so that
f ′(x) =
(e) Using Rule 4 with u = ÷x and v = x + 1 so that u′(x)
and v′(x) = 1, we
obtain
f ′(x) =
(f) Using Rule 4 with u = x3 + 2x + 1 and v = x2 + 1, we obtain
f ′(x) =
=
Symbolically in MATLAB, if y = f(x) then its derivative, with respect to x, is 
determined using the diff(y) or diff(y,x) commands (either can be used as 
y is a function of only one variable). Thus the derivative is determined by the 
commands
syms x y
y = f(x); dy = diff(y)
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are
y:= f(x); dy:= diff(y,x);
In both cases the simplify command may be used to simplify the answer returned
by the diff command. To illustrate, we consider Example 8.10(b), for which the
commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
syms x y
y = (2*x^2 + 5)*(x^2 + 3*x + 1);
y:= (2*x^2 + 5)*

dy = diff(y)
dy:= diff(y,x);

Using the simplify command, coupled with the pretty command for MATLAB,
we have that the commands
dy = simplify(dy);
dy:= simplify(dy);
pretty(dy)
return the derivative as
dy = 8x 3 + 18x 2 + 14x + 15
In practice we often anticipate the need to simplify and use the single command
simplify(diff(y)) in MATLAB and simplify(diff(y,x)); in MAPLE.
Considering Example 8.10(e), the MATLAB commands
syms x y
y = sqrt(x)/(x + 1); dy = simplify(diff(y));
pretty(dy)
return the derivative as
dy = -1/2 
For practice check the answers to sections (a), (c), (d) and (f) of Example 8.10 using
MATLAB or MAPLE.

Differentiation of polynomial functions
Using the result
given in equation (8.9), together with the rules developed in Section 8.3.1, we proceed

numbers.
Using the constant multiplication rule together with the sum rule we may differentiate

Example 8.11
If y = 2x4 −2x3 −x2 + 3x −2, ﬁnd 
.
Solution
Differentiating term by term, using the sum rule, gives
which on using the constant multiplication rule gives
= 2(4x3) −2(3x2) −(2x) + 3(1) −0
so that
= 8x3 −6x2 −2x + 3
Example 8.12
The distance s metres moved by a body in t seconds is given by
s = 2t3 −1.5t2 −6t + 12
Determine the velocity and acceleration after 2 seconds.
Solution
s = 2t3 −1.5t2 −6t + 12
The velocity v (ms−1) is given by
, so that
= 2(3t2) −1.5(2t) −6(1) = 6t2 −3t −6
When t = 2 seconds
v = 6(4) −3(2) −6 = 12
so that the velocity after 2 seconds is 12ms−1.
The acceleration a (ms−2) is given by
, so that
(6t2 −3t −6) = 12t −3
When t = 2 seconds
a = 12(2) −3 = 21
so that the acceleration after 2 seconds is 21ms−2.

Sometimes polynomial functions are not expressed in the standard form of (8.10),
f(x) = (2x + 5)3 and f(x) = (3x −1)2(x + 2)3 being such examples. Such cases will 
be considered in Section 8.3.6 where the differentiation of composite functions will be
discussed.
The derivatives of polynomial functions can be evaluated numerically by a simple
extension of the method of synthetic division (or nested multiplication) which is used
for evaluating the function itself. We saw in Section 2.4.3 that
f(x) = anx n + an−1x n−1+ … + a1x + a0
could be written as f(x) = g(x)(x −c) + f(c) where
g(x) = bn−1x n−1 + bn−2x n−2 + … + b1x + b0
and where the coefﬁcients bn−1, … , b0 were generated in the process of nested multi-
plication. Differentiating f(x) with respect to x using the product rule gives
f ′(x) = g′(x)(x −c) + g(x)(1)
so that
f ′(c) = g′(c)(0) + g(c)(1) = g(c)
Thus we can evaluate f ′(c) by applying the nested multiplication method again but this
time to g(x).
Example 8.13

This method of evaluating the function and its derivative is very efﬁcient and is often
used in computer packages which require ﬁnding the roots of polynomial equations.

Differentiation of rational functions
As we saw in Section 2.5, rational functions have the general form
where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials. To obtain the derivatives of such functions we
make use of the constant multiplication, sum and quotient rules, as illustrated in
Example 8.14.

8.3.6
Differentiation of composite functions
As mentioned earlier, to differentiate many functions we need a further rule to deal with
composite functions.
Rule 5 (composite-function or chain rule)
If z = g(x) and y = f(z) then
Verifying Rule 5 is a little more difﬁcult than Rules 1–4. For an increment ∆x in x,
let ∆z and ∆y be the corresponding increments in z and y respectively. It then follows
from deﬁnition (8.1) that
∆z = g′(x)∆x + ε1 ∆x
(8.11)
where ε1 →0 as ∆x →0. Likewise
∆y = f ′(z)∆z + ε2 ∆z
(8.12)
where ε2 →0 as ∆z →0. Combining (8.11) and (8.12) then gives
∆y = [ f ′(z) + ε2][g′(x) + ε1]∆x
so that
= f ′(z)g′(x) + ε2g′(x) + ε1 f ′(z) + ε1ε2
As ∆x →0 so does ∆z →0, ε1 →0 and ε2 →0 and
as required.
Adapting Figure 2.12 (Section 2.2.4), the chain rule
may be represented as in Figure 8.18.

Example 8.15
Find 
when y is
(a) (5x2 + 11)9
(b) ÷(3x2 + 1)
Solution
(a) In this case we could expand out (5x2 + 11)9 and treat it as a polynomial of degree 18.
However, it is advantageous to view it as a composite function, as represented in 
Figure 8.19(a). Thus, taking
y = z9
and
z = 5x2 + 11
= 9z8
and
= 10x
so, by the chain rule,
= 9(5x2 + 11)8(10x) = 90x(5x2 + 11)8
(b) The composite function y = ÷(3x2 + 1) may be represented as in Figure 8.19(b).
Thus, taking
y = ÷z = z1/2
and
z = 3x2 + 1
and
= 6x
so, by the chain rule,
It is usual to refer to z as the intermediate (or auxiliary) variable, and once the 
process has been understood the schematic representation, by a block diagram, stage is
dispensed with. Note that when z = g(z) is a linear function z = ax + b, then 
= a and 
= af ′(ax + b).

Find 
when y is

(b)

(d)
Solution
(a) Introducing the intermediate variable z = 3x 3 −2x 2 + 1 we have
y = z5
and
z = 3x3 −2x2 + 1
= 5z4
and
= 9x2 −4x
so, by the chain rule,
= 5(3x 3 −2x 2 + 1)4(9x 2 −4x)
= 5x(9x −4)(3x 3 −2x 2 + 1)4
(b) Introducing the intermediate variable z = 5x2 −2 we have
y =

and
z = 5x 2 −2
and
so, by the chain rule,
(c) In this case we are dealing with the product y = uv where u = (x 2 + 1)3 and 
v = ÷(x −1). Then by the product rule
To ﬁnd
we introduce the intermediate variable z = x2 + 1 giving u = z3 and so, by the

Differentiation of inverse functions
The algebraic and graphical properties of inverse functions were described in
Section 2.2.3 earlier. It is often useful to be able to express the derivative of an inverse
function in terms of the derivatives of the original function from which it came. To do
this we use the following rule
(x 2 + 1)2(13x 2 - 12x + 1)
2÷(x - 1)
(x 2 + 1)2(13x 2 - 12x + 1)

Rule 6 (inVerse-function rule)
If y = f −1(x) then x = f(y) and
Rule 6 may be readily deduced from graphical considerations. Since the graph of
y = f −1(x) is the mirror image of the graph of y = f(x) in the line y = x (see Figure 8.20)
it follows that since tanθ = cot( π −θ), the gradient with respect to the x direction is
We will be making use of this rule in following sections, but a simple example is to 
consider the function deﬁned by y = x1/ 3. Then x = y3 and 
= 3y2. Using the inverse-
function rule we obtain
Since y = x1/3 we deduce that

Taking f(x) = sin x and using the sum identity (2.26b) gives from the formal deﬁnition (8.1)
Since, from Section 7.8.1, remembering that x is measured in radians here,
we have

Likewise, using the sum identity (2.25d), we have
from which we deduce using (8.1) that

Since cot x = cos x/sin x, taking u = cos x and v = sin x and using the quotient rule gives

(a) sin(2x + 3)
(b) x2 cos x

Solution
(a) Introducing the intermediate variable z = 2x + 3, we have y = sin z and z = 2x + 3,
so by the chain rule
= cos(2x + 3)2 = 2cos(2x + 3)
Note that this result could have been written using the particular linear case of the 
composite-function rule given in Section 8.3.6 after Example 8.15.

Extended form of the chain rule
Sometimes there are more than two component functions involved in a composite
function. For example, consider the composite function
y = f(w),
w = g(z),
z = h(x)
which may be represented schematically by the block diagram of Figure 8.23. To obtain 
the derivative 
we ﬁrst consider y as a composite function of h and the ‘dotted box’,
giving, on applying the chain rule,
Reapplying the chain rule, this time with z as the domain variable, gives
which on back substitution gives
as the extended form of the chain rule.

Solution
(a) Introducing the intermediate variables z = x2 + 1 and w = sin z, then
y = w2,
w = sin z,
z = x2 + 1
so by the extended chain rule
Since z = x2 + 1 and w = sin z = sin(x2 + 1),
= 4x sin(x2 + 1)cos(x2 + 1)
(b) Introducing the intermediate variables z = 1 −x2 and w = ÷z, then
y = cos−1w,
w = z1/2,
z = 1 −x2
Since z = 1 −x 2 and w = ÷(1 −x 2) we have, by the extended chain rule,
Here we have assumed 0  x  1. If −1  x  0 the derivative is −1/÷(1 −x2). The
function has no derivative at x = 0. This is illustrated in Figure 8.24.

Parametric and implicit differentiation
The chain rule is used with the inverse-function rule to evaluate derivatives when a
function is speciﬁed parametrically.
Rule 7 (parametric differentiation)
In general, if a function is deﬁned by y = f(x), where x = g(t) and y = h(t)
and t is a parameter, then

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
Solution
The graph of f(x) is shown in Figure 8.25. There are many ways in which dy/dx may
be evaluated. The simplest uses the result (8.26). In this case
so that
This gives the result in terms of t. In terms of x, it may be written as
In terms of x and y, we have
Note from Figure 8.25 that the graph does not have a well-deﬁned tangent at x = 0, so the
derivative does not exist at this point; that is, the function is not differentiable at x = 0.
We can also obtain these results directly. Eliminating t between the deﬁning equa-
tions for x and y, we have
y = x2/3
Differentiating with respect to x gives
The chain rule may also be used to differentiate functions expressed in an implicit
form (see Section 2.8.2). For example, the function of Example 8.21 may be expressed
implicitly, by eliminating t, as
y3 = x2
To obtain the derivative dy/dx, we use the method known as implicit differentiation.
In this method we treat y as an unknown function of x and differentiate both sides term
by term with respect to x. This gives

Now y3 is a composite function of x, with y being the intermediate variable, so the chain
rule gives
Then, substituting back, we have

(on substituting for y3)
Parametric differentiation is achieved using the MATLAB commands (or com-
parable MAPLE commands)
syms x y t
x = x(t); y = y(t); dx = diff(x,t); dy = diff(y,t); 
dydx = dy/dx
Example 8.22
Find 
when x2 + y2 + xy = 1.
Solution
Differentiating both sides, term by term, gives
Recognizing that y is a function of x and taking care over the product term xy, the chain
rule gives
leading to
Implicit differentiation is useful in calculating the slopes of tangents and normals to
curves speciﬁed implicitly, such as in Example 8.22. Having obtained the slope of the 
tangent at the point (x, y) as 
, the slope of the normal to the curve at the correspond-
ing point is −1/(slope of tangent) as inferred from Figure 8.5.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
Example 8.23
Find the equations of the tangent and normal to the curve having equation 
x 2 + y2 −3xy + 4 = 0 at the point (2, 4).
Solution
Differentiating the equation implicitly with respect to x
gives
This represents the slope of the tangent at the point (x, y) on the curve. Thus the slope
of the tangent at the point (2, 4) is
Remembering from equation (1.14) that the equation of a line passing through a point
(x, y) and having slope m is y −y1 = m(x −x1) we have that the equation of the tangent
to the graph at (2, 4) is
(y −4) = 4(x −2)
or
y = 4x −4
The slope of the normal at (2, 4) is
, so it has equation
y −4 =
(x −2)
or
4y = 18 −x
Example 8.24
Find the slope of the tangents to the circle
x2 + y2 −2x + 4y −20 = 0
at the points A(1, 3), B(4, 2) and C(−2, −6).
Solution
The circle deﬁned by the equation is shown in Figure 8.26, together with the three
points A, B and C. Clearly this equation does not deﬁne a function in general, but near
speciﬁc points we can restrict it so that it behaves locally like a function. To compute
the slopes of the tangents, we differentiate the equation deﬁning the curve with respect

example we have
giving
Then at A the slope is zero, at B the slope is
, and at C the slope is
. Note
that dy/dx is not deﬁned at y = −2. There are two corresponding points: (−4, −2) and 
(6, −2). At these points the curve has a vertical tangent.
The implicit differentiation rule can be used in a double way to obtain derivatives of
functions of the form f(x)g(x), as illustrated in Example 8.25.
Example 8.25
Find the derivative of the function
f(x) = (sin x)x
(x  (0, π))
Solution
The simplest way of dealing with this is ﬁrst to take logarithms. Thus y = (sin x)x gives
ln y = x lnsin x
Then differentiating implicitly with respect to x, remembering that y is a function of x,
gives
and so
= (lnsin x + x cot x)(sin x)x
Sometimes the technique used in Example 8.25 is described as logarithmic differenti-
ation. It is useful for differentiating complicated functions.
Example 8.26
Differentiate with respect to x

To simplify the process, we ﬁrst take logarithms

is its acceleration and this is used in the mathematical modelling of problems in
mechanics using the law:
mass × acceleration = applied force
Example 8.27
Find the second derivative of the functions given by
(a) y = 3x4 −2x2 + x −1
(b) y = x/(x2 + 1)
(c) y = e−xsin2x

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
Solution
(a) Differentiating once gives
= 12x3 −4x + 1
and differentiating a second time gives
= 36x2 −4
(b) This simply requires two differentiations, as above,
Then 
(c) This simply requires two differentiations. Applying the product rule, we have
= (e−x)(2cos2x) + (sin2x)(−e−x) = e−x(2cos2x −sin2x)
Applying the rule again we have
= (e−x)(−4 sin 2x −2cos 2x) + (2cos2x −sin2x)(−e−x)
= −e−x(3sin2x + 4 cos 2x)
(d) Again this simply requires two differentiations. Applying the quotient rule, we have
Applying the rule again, we obtain
The second derivative is obtained using the commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
d2y = diff(y,2)
d2y:= diff(y,x,x);
and the third derivative by the commands
d3y = diff(y,3)
d3y:= diff(y,x,x,x); or 
d3y:= diff(y,x$3);
and so on for higher derivatives.

8.4 HIGHER DERIVATIVES

Considering Example 8.27(c) the commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
syms x y
y = exp(–x)*sin(2*x);
y:= exp(–x)*sin(2*x):
d2y = simplify(diff(y,2));
d2y:= diff(y,x,x);
pretty(d2y)
return the second derivative as
d2y = –exp(–x)(3sin(2x) +
d2y:= –3e(–x)sin(2x) –
4cos(2x))
4 e(–x)cos(2x)
Example 8.28
Show that
y = e−t(A cos t + B sin t) + 2 sin 2t −cos 2t
satisﬁes the equation
+ 2y = 10 cos 2t
Solution
Differentiating y twice with respect to t gives
= e−t[(A −B)cos t + (A + B)sin t] + 4cos 2t + 2sin 2t
= e−t[−2Bcos t + 2A sin t] −8sin 2t + 4cos 2t
Thus
+ 2y = 10cos 2t
When determining the second derivative using parametric or implicit differentiation
care must be taken to ensure correct use of the chain rule. The approach is illustrated in
Example 8.29.

when y is given by
(a) y = t2, x = t3

Further results for higher derivatives are developed in Exercises 8.4.2. These are on the
whole straightforward extensions of previous work. One result that sometimes causes
blunders is the extension of the inverse-function rule to higher derivatives.
We know that

8.4.3
Curvature of plane curves
The second derivative d2f/dx 2 represents the rate of change of df/dx as x increases; geo-
metrically, this gives us information as to how the slope of the tangent to the graph of
y = f(x) is changing with increasing x.
l
If d2f/dx2  0 then df/dx is increasing as x increases, and the tangent rotates in
an anticlockwise direction as we move along the horizontal axis, as illustrated 
in Figure 8.28(a).
l
If d2f/dx2  0 then df/dx is decreasing as x increases, and the tangent rotates 
in a clockwise direction as we move along the horizontal axis, as illustrated in
Figure 8.28(b).
Also note that when d2f/dx 2  0, the graph of y = f(x) is ‘concave up’, and when 
d2f/dx2  0 the graph is ‘concave down’. Thus the sign of d2f/dx2 relates to the concavity
of the graph; we shall use this information in Section 8.5.1 to deﬁne a point of inﬂection.
The curvature κ of a plane curve, having equation y = f(x), at any point is the rate
at which the curve is bending or curving away from the tangent at that point. In other
words, the curvature measures the rate at which the tangent to the curve changes as it
moves along the curve. This implies that it will depend on d2f/dx2 in some way.
Take two points P and Q on the curve y = f(x) and a distance ∆s apart measured
along the curve. Then, with the notation of Figure 8.29(a), the average curvature of the

8.4 HIGHER DERIVATIVES
607
curve PQ is ∆θ/∆s. We then deﬁne the curvature κ of the curve at the point P to be the
absolute value of the average curvature as Q approaches P. That is,
(8.27)
If we now construct a circle, as shown in Figure 8.29(b), so that it
l
has the same tangent at P as y = f(x),
l
lies on the same side of the tangent as y = f(x) and
l
has the same curvature κ as y = f(x) at P
then this is called the circle of curvature at P. Its radius ρ is called the radius of
curvature at P and is given by
ρ = radius of curvature =
The centre of the circle is called the centre of curvature at P. Clearly the curvature is
zero when the radius of curvature is inﬁnite.
In order to obtain the curvature of a curve given by an equation of the form y = f(x),
we must obtain a more usable formula than (8.27). Since

differentiating with respect to s, using the chain rule, gives
so that
(8.28)
using the trigonometric identity 1 + tan2θ = sec2θ.
We shall see in Section 8.9.6 that
so, from the inverse-function rule,
which on substituting into (8.28) gives the formula
(8.29)
If we denote the coordinates of the centre of curvature by (X, Y) then it follows from
Figure 8.29(b) that
X = x −ρ sinθ,
Y = y + ρ cosθ
Since tanθ = dy/dx, it follows that
Using these results together with ρ = 1/κ, with κ from (8.29), gives the coordinates of
the centre of curvature as
(8.30)
Although these results have been deduced for the curve of Figure 8.29(b), which at the
point P(x, y) has positive slope (dy/dx  0) and is concave upwards (d2y/dx2  0), it
can be shown that these are valid in all cases.
It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that if the curve y = f(x) is given in
parametric form
x = g(t),
y = h(t)
then the curvature κ is given by

Applications to optimization problems
In many industrial situations the role of management is to make decisions that will lead
to the most effective use of the resources available. These decisions seldom affect the
whole operation in one sweeping decision, but are usually a chain of small decisions:
organizing stock control, designing a product, pricing it, servicing equipment and so on.
Effective management seeks to optimize the constituent parts of the whole operation. 
A wide variety of mathematical techniques are used to solve such optimization prob-
lems. Here, and later in Section 9.4.9, we consider methods based on the methods and
concepts of calculus.
8.5.1
Optimal values
The basic idea is that the optimal value of a differentiable function f(x) (that is, its
maximum or minimum value) generally occurs where its derivative is zero; that is,
where
f ′(x) = 0
As can be seen from Figure 8.30, this is a necessary condition, since at a maximum 
or minimum value of the function its graph has a horizontal tangent. Figure 8.30 
does, however, show that these extremal values are generally only local maximum or
Figure 8.30
Maximum and
minimum values.

Figure 8.33
Change in slope on

turning point.
610
DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
minimum values, corresponding to turning points on the graph, so some care must be 
exercised in using the horizontal tangent as a test for an optimal value. In seeking the
extremal values of a function it is also necessary to check the end points (if any) of the
domain of the function.
Figure 8.31 gives another illustration of why care must be exercised: at some points
of inﬂection – that is, points where the graph crosses its own tangent – the tangent may
be horizontal.
A third reason for caution is that a function may have an optimal value at a point
where its derivative does not exist. A simple example of this is given by f(x) = x2 /3,
whose graph is shown in Figure 8.32.
Having determined the critical or stationary points where f ′(x) = 0, we need to be
able to determine their character or nature; that is, whether they correspond to a local
maximum, a local minimum or a point of inﬂection of the function f(x). We can do this
by examining values of f ′(x) close to and on either side of the critical point. From
Figure 8.33 we see that

Determine the stationary points of the function
f(x) = 4x3 −21x2 + 18x + 6
and examine their nature.

8.5 APPLICATIONS TO OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
611
Solution
The derivative is
f ′(x) = 12x2 −42x + 18 = 6(2x −1)(x −3)
Stationary points occur when f ′(x) = 0; that is,
6(2x −1)(x −3) = 0
the solutions of which are x =
and x = 3. The corresponding values of the function are
and
f(3) = 4(27) −21(9) + 18(3) + 6 = −21
so that the stationary points of f(x) are
and
(3, −21)
In order to investigate their nature, we use the procedure outlined above.
(a) Considering the point 
: if x is a little less than 
then 2x −1  0 and
x −3  0, so that
f ′(x) = 6(2x −1)(x −3) = (negative)(negative) = (positive)
while if x is a little greater than 
then 2x −1  0 and x −3  0, so that
f ′(x) = (positive)(negative) = (negative)
Thus f ′(x) changes from (positive) to (negative) as we pass through the point so that
is a local maximum.
(b) Considering the point (3, −21): if x is a little less than 3 then 2x −1  0 and 
x −3  0, so that
f ′(x) = (positive)(negative) = (negative)
while if x is a little greater than 3 then 2x −1  0 and x −3  0, so that
f ′(x) = (positive)(positive) = (positive)
Thus f ′(x) changes from (negative) to (positive) as we pass through the point so that
(3, −21) is a local minimum.
This information may now be used to sketch a graph of f (x), as illustrated in
Figure 8.34.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
An alternative approach to determining the nature of a stationary point is to calcu-
late the value of the second derivative f ″(x) at the point. Recall from Section 8.4.1 that
f ″(x) determines the rate of change of f′(x). Suppose that f(x) has a stationary point at
x = a, so that f ′(a) = 0. Then, provided f ″(a) is deﬁned, either f ″(a)  0, f ″(a) = 0 or
f ″(a)  0.
If f ″(a)  0 then f ′(x) is decreasing at x = a; and since f ′(a) = 0, it follows that
f ′(x)  0 for values of x just less than a and f ′(x)  0 for values of x just greater than
a. We therefore conclude that x = a corresponds to a local maximum. Note that this
concurs with our observation in Section 8.4.1 that the sign of f ″(x) determines the 
concavity of the graph of f(x). Since the graph is concave down at a local maximum,
f ″(a)  0. The equality case is discussed further in Section 9.4.9.
Similarly, we can argue that if f ″(a)  0 then the stationary point x = a corresponds
to a local minimum. Again this concurs with our observation that the graph is concave
up at a local minimum.
Summarizing, we have
l
the function f(x) has a local maximum at x = a provided f ′(a) = 0 and f ″(a)  0;
l
the function f(x) has a local minimum at x = a provided f ′(a) = 0 and 
f ″(a)  0.
If f ″(a) = 0, we cannot assume that x = a corresponds to a point of inﬂection, and we
must revert to considering the sign of f ′(x) on either side of the stationary point. As
mentioned earlier, at a point of inﬂection the graph crosses its own tangent, or, in other
words, the concavity of the graph changes. Since the concavity is determined by the
sign of f ″(x), it follows that f ″(x) = 0 at a point of inﬂection and that f ″(x) changes sign as
we pass through the point. Note, as illustrated by the graph of Figure 8.35, that it is not
necessary for f ′(x) = 0 at a point of inﬂection. If, as illustrated in Figure 8.31, f ′(x) = 0
at a point of inﬂection then it is a stationary point of inﬂection. It does not follow,
however, that if f ′(a) = 0 and f ″(a) = 0 then x = a is a point of inﬂection. An example
of when this is not the case is y = x4, which, as illustrated in Figure 8.36, has a local
minimum at x = 0 even though both dy/dx and d2y/dx2 are zero at x = 0. It is for this
reason that we must take care and revert to considering the sign of f ′(x) on either side.
We shall return to reconsider these conditions in Section 9.4.9 following consideration
of Taylor series.

Example 8.31
Using the second derivative, conﬁrm the nature of the stationary points of the function
f(x) = 4x3 −21x2 + 18x + 6
determined in Example 8.30.
Solution
We have
f ′(x) = 12x2 −42x + 18
so that
f ″(x) = 24x −42
At the stationary point 
f ″(
) = 12 −42 = −30  0
conﬁrming that it corresponds to a local maximum.
At the stationary point (3, −21)
f ″(3) = 72 −42 = 30  0
conﬁrming that it corresponds to a local minimum.
Note also that f ″(x) = 0 at x =
and that f ″(x)  0 for x 
and f ″(x)  0 for
x 
. Thus 
is a point of inﬂection (but not a stationary point of inﬂection),
which is clearly identiﬁable in the graph of Figure 8.34.
Considering the cubic of Examples 8.30 and 8.31 the stationary points may be investi-
gated using the following MATLAB commands
syms x y
y = 4*x^3 – 21*x^2 + 18*x + 6; dy = diff(y); solve(dy)
The last command solves dy = 0 to obtain the x coordinates 3 and 1/2 of the station-
ary points, and the commands
y1 = subs(y,x,3)
y2 = subs(y,x,1/2)
determine the corresponding y coordinates –21 and 10.25; so that the stationary
points are (3,–21) and (1/2,10.25). The commands
d2y = diff(y,2);
subs(d2y,x,3)
subs(d2y,x,1/2)
return the value of the second derivative at each stationary point as 30 and –30
respectively; thus conﬁrming that (3,–21) is a local minimum and that

(1/2,10.25) is a local maximum. Finally, to illustrate the results the plot of the
cubic is given by the command
ezplot(y,[–1,5]).
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are
y:= 4*x^3 – 21*x^2 + 18*x + 6; dy:= diff(y,x); 
solve(dy = 0,x);
y1:= subs(x = 3,y); y2:= subs(x = 1/2,y);
d2y:= diff(y,x,x); subs(x = 3,d2y); subs(x = 1/2,d2y);
plot(y,x = –1..5);
Example 8.32
Determine the stationary values of the function
f(x) = x2 −
,
x ≠0
Solution
The derivative is
f ′(x) =
and f ′(x) = 0 when
2x4 −6x3 −82x −90 = 0
Factorizing we have
2(x2 −4x −5)(x2 + x + 9) = 0
or
2(x + 1)(x −5)(x2 + x + 9) = 0
So the real roots are x = 5 and x = −1.
At x = 5, f(5) = 66/5. To decide whether this is a maximum or minimum we examine
the value of f ″(x) at x = 5.
f ″(x) =
and
f ″(5)  0
Thus f(5) = 66/5 is a minimum value of the function.
At x = −1, f(−1) = −30 and f″(−1)  0, so that f(−1) = −30 is also a minimum of the
function.
Note that f(x) has an asymptote x = 0 and behaves like (x −3)2 where |x| is very large.
In many applications, we know for practical reasons that a particular problem has
a minimum (or maximum) solution. If the equation f ′(x) = 0 is satisﬁed by only one
sensible value of x then that value must determine the unique minimum (or maximum)
we are seeking. We will illustrate using three simple examples.

Example 8.33
A manufacturer has to supply N items per month at a uniform daily rate. Each time a
production run is started it costs £c1, the ‘set-up’ cost. In addition, each item costs 
£c2 to manufacture. To avoid unnecessarily high production costs, the manufacturer
decides to produce a large quantity q in one run and store it until the contract calls for
delivery. The cost of storing each item is £c3 per month. What is the optimal size of a
production run?
Solution
As the contract calls for a monthly supply of N items, we need to look for a production
run size that will minimize the total monthly cost to the manufacturer.
The costs the manufacturer incurs are the production costs and the storage costs. The
production cost for a production run of q items is
£(c1 + c2q)
This production run will satisfy the contract for q/N months, so the monthly production
cost will be
To this must be added the monthly storage cost, which will be £ qc3, since the stock is 
depleted at a uniform rate and the average stock size is
q. Thus the total monthly cost
£C is given by
which has a graph similar to that shown in Figure 8.37.
To ﬁnd the value q* of q that minimizes C, we differentiate the expression for C with
respect to q and set the derivative equal to zero:
and
and hence
This quantity is called the economic lot size.
Optimization plays an important role in design, and in Example 8.34 we illustrate this
by applying it to the relatively easy problem of designing a milk carton.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
Example 8.34
A milk retailer wishes to design a milk carton that has a square cross-section, as illus-
trated in Figure 8.38(a), and is to contain two pints of milk (2 pints ≡1.136 litres). The
carton is to be made from a rectangular sheet of waxed cardboard, by folding into 
a square tube and sealing down the edge, and then folding and sealing the top and 
bottom. To make the resulting carton airtight and robust for handling, an overlap of at
least 5 mm is needed. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 8.38(b). As the milk retailer
will be using a large number of such cartons, there is a requirement to use the design
that is least expensive to produce. In particular the retailer desires the design that 
minimizes the amount of waxed cardboard used.
Solution
If, as illustrated in Figure 8.38(a), the ﬁnal dimensions of the container are h × b × b
(all in mm) then the area of waxed cardboard required is
A = (4b + 5)(h + b + 10)
(8.32)
Since the capacity of the carton is ﬁxed at two pints (1.136 litres), the values of h and
b must be such that
volume = hb2 = 1136000mm3
(8.33)
Substituting (8.33) back into (8.32) gives
To ﬁnd the value of b that minimizes A, we differentiate A with respect to b to obtain
A′(b) and then set A′(b) = 0. Differentiating gives
so the required value of b is given by the root of the equation
8b4 + 45b3 −4 544 000b −11360 000 = 0
A straightforward tabulation of this polynomial, or use of a suitable software package,
yields a root at b = 81.8. From (8.33) the corresponding value of h is h = 169.8. Thus
the optimal design of the milk carton will have dimensions 81.8mm × 81.8mm ×
169.8mm.

8.5 APPLICATIONS TO OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS

Optimization problems also occur in programmes for replacing equipment and machin-
ery in industry. We will illustrate this by a more commonplace decision: the best 
policy for replacing a car.
Example 8.35
For a particular model of car, bought for £14 750, the second-hand value after 
t years is given fairly accurately by the formula
price = £e9.55−0.11t
The running costs of the car increase as the car gets older, so after t years the annual
running cost is £(917 + 163t). When should it be replaced?
Solution
The accumulated running cost for the car over t years is
= £(835.5 + 81.5t)t
The total cost of the car clearly includes depreciation as well as running costs, so the
average annual cost £C of the car is given by
To ﬁnd the optimal time for replacing the car, we ﬁnd the value of t that minimizes C.
Differentiating C with respect to t gives
Setting C′(t) = 0 gives
Solving this numerically gives t = 5.3.

A numerical method which is more efﬁcient than

A pipeline is to be laid from a point A on one
bank of a river of width 1 unit to a point B 2 units
downstream on the opposite bank, as shown in
Figure 8.40. Because it costs more to lay the pipe
under water than on dry land, it is proposed to take
it in a straight line across the river to a point C and
then along the river bank to B. If it costs α% more
to lay a given length of pipe under the river than
along the bank, write down a formula for the cost
of the pipeline, specifying the domain of the
function carefully. What recommendation would
you make about the position of C when (a) α = 25,

Cross-current extraction methods are used in many
chemical processes. Solute is extracted from a
stream of solvent by repeated washings with water.
The solvent stream is passed consecutively through
a sequence of extractors, in each of which a cross-
current of wash water, ﬂowing at a determined
rate, carries out some of the solute. The aim is to
choose the individual wash ﬂowrates in such a
way as to extract as much solute as possible by 
the end, the total ﬂow of wash water being ﬁxed.
Consider the three-state extractor process
shown in Figure 8.41, where c, x, y and z are the
solute concentrations in the main stream, and αx,
αy and αz are the solute concentrations in the
efﬂuent wash-water streams, with α a constant.
The solute balance equations for the extractors are
Q(c −x) = uαx
Q(x −y) = vαy
Q(y −z) = wαz
The total wash-water ﬂowrate is W, so that
u + v + w = W
We wish to ﬁnd u, v and w such that the outﬂow
concentration z is minimized.
This is an example of dynamic programming.
The key to its solution is the Principle of
Optimality, which states that an optimal
programme has the property that, whatever the
initial state and decisions, the remaining decisions
must constitute an optimal policy with respect to
the state resulting from the initial decision. This
means we solve the problem ﬁrst for a one-
extractor process, then for a two-extractor process,
then for a three-extractor process, and so on.
For a one-stage process, x is minimized when
u = W, giving x* = Qc/(Q + αW).
For a two-stage process, y = Qx/(Q + αv), where
x =
W with v =
W, giving y* = Q2c/(Q +
αW)2.
For a three-stage process, z = Q2x/[Q +
α(W −u)]2, where x = Qc/(Q + αu). Show that z
is minimized when u =
W, with v = w =
W,
giving z* = Q3c/(Q +
αW)3.
Generalize your answers to the case where n
extractors are used.
88
The management of resources often requires a
chain of decisions similar to that described in
Question 87. Consider the harvesting policy for a
large forest. The proﬁt produced from the sale of
felled timber is proportional to the square root of
the volume sold, while the volume of standing
timber increases in proportion to itself year on
year. Use the technique outlined in Question 87 
to produce a 10-year harvesting programme for a
forest.

Numerical differentiation
Although the formula
provides the deﬁnition of the derivative of f(x), it does not provide a good basis for
evaluating f ′(x) numerically. This is because it provides a one-sided approximation of
the gradient at x, as shown in Figure 8.42. When we set ∆x = h ( 0), we obtain the
slope of the chord PR. When we set ∆x = −h ( 0), we obtain the slope of the chord
QP. Clearly the chord QR offers a better approximation to the tangent at P. A second
reason why the formal deﬁnition of a derivative yields a poor approximation is that the
evaluation of derivatives involves the division of a small quantity ∆f by a second small
quantity ∆x. This process magniﬁes the rounding errors involved in calculating ∆f from
the values of f(x), a process that worsens as ∆x →0. This phenomenon is called ill-
conditioning. Generally speaking, numerical differentiation is a process in which
accuracy is lost and the ‘noise’ caused by experimental error is magniﬁed.
8.6.1
The chord approximation
This method uses the slope of a chord QR symmetrically disposed about x to approxi-
mate the slope of the tangent at x, as shown in Figure 8.43. Thus
Thus when the function is speciﬁed graphically, a value of h is chosen, and at a series
of points along the curve the quotient φ(h) is calculated. When the function is given as
a table of values, we do not have control of the value of h, but the same approximation
is used using the tabular interval as h. Consequently, to estimate the value of the deriv-
ative f ′(a) at x = a we use the approximation

as the basis for an extrapolation. For almost all functions commonly occurring in engin-
eering applications
f ′(a) = φ(h) + terms involving powers of h greater than or equal to h2
For example, considering f(x) = x3
Similarly, for f(x) = x 4
φ(h) = 4a3 + 4ah2
In general, we may write
f ′(a) = φ(h) + Ah2 + terms involving higher powers of h
where A is independent of h. Interval-halving gives
f ′(a) = φ( h) +
A′h2 + terms involving higher powers of h
where A′  A. Hence we obtain a better estimate for f ′(a) by extrapolation, eliminating
the terms involving h2:
f ′(a) 
[4φ( h) −φ(h)]

We illustrate this technique in Example 8.36.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
In general, any numerical procedure is subject to two types of error. One is due to
the accumulation of rounding errors within a calculation, while the other is due to the
nature of the approximation formula (the truncation error). In this example the trunca-
tion error is of order h2 for φ(h), but we do not have an estimate for the truncation error
for the extrapolated estimate for f ′(a). This will be discussed in the next chapter
following the introduction of the Taylor series (see Exercises 9.4.6, Question 23). The
effect of the rounding errors on the answer can be assessed, however, and, using the
methods of Chapter 1, we see that the maximum effect of the rounding errors on
the answer in Example 8.36 is ±2.5 × 10−4.

8.7
Integration
In this section we shall introduce the concept of integration and illustrate its role in
problem-solving and modelling situations.
8.7.1
Basic ideas and deﬁnitions
Consider an object moving along a line with constant velocity u (in ms−1). The distance
s (in m) travelled by the object between times t1 and t2 (in s) is given by
s = u(t2 −t1)

8.7 INTEGRATION
623
This is the area ‘under’ the graph of the velocity function between t = t1 and t = t2, as
shown in Figure 8.44. This, of course, deals with the special case where the velocity is
a constant function. However, even when the velocity varies with time, the area under
the velocity graph still gives the distance travelled. Consider the velocity graph shown
in Figure 8.45(a). We can approximate the velocity–time graph by a series of small
horizontal lines that lie either entirely below the curve (as in Figure 8.45(b)) or entirely
above it (Figure 8.45(c)). An object moving such that its velocity–time graph is (b)
would always be slower at a particular time than an object with velocity–time graph (a),
so that the distance it covers is less than that of the object with graph (a). Similarly, an
object with velocity–time graph (c) will cover a greater distance than an object with
graph (a). Thus 
distance with graph (b)  distance with graph (a)  distance with graph (c) 
In cases (b) and (c), because the velocities are piecewise-constant, the distances covered
are represented by the areas under the graphs between t = t1 and t = t2. So we have
area under graph (b)  area under graph (a)  area under graph (c)
If the horizontal steps of graphs (b) and (c) are made very small, the difference between
the areas for the approximating graphs (b) and (c) becomes very small. In other words,
the distance for graph (a) is just the area under the graph between t = t1 and t = t2.
This is one of many practical problems that involve this process of area evaluation
at some stage in their solution. This process is called integration: the summing together
of all the parts that make up a given area. The area under the graph is called the
integral of the function. For some functions it is possible to obtain formulae for their
integrals; for others we have to be content with numerical approximations.

shows the distance
travelled by the object 
between times t1 and t2.

graph and two

approximations to it.

Formally, we deﬁne the integral of the function f(x) between x = a and x = b to be
where a = x0  x1  x2  …  xn−1  xn = b are the points of subdivision of the 
interval [a, b],
∆xr−1 = xr −xr−1, ∆x = max(∆x0, ∆x1, … , ∆xn−1) and xr−1  x*r  xr
Here we have used the special notation
to emphasize that n →∞and ∆x →0 simultaneously. The value of the integral is
independent of both the method of subdivision of [a, b] and the choices of x*r.
The usual notation for the integral is

b
a
f(x)dx
where the integration symbol  is an elongated S, standing for ‘summation’. The dx
is called the differential of x, and a and b are called the limits of integration. The 
function f(x) being integrated is the integrand.
The process is illustrated in Figure 8.46, where the area under the graph of f(x) for
x  [a, b] has been subdivided into n vertical strips (by which we strictly mean that
the area has been approximated by the n vertical strips). The area of a typical strip is
given by
f(x*r )(xr −xr−1) = f(x*r )∆xr−1
where xr−1  x*r  xr and ∆xr−1 = xr −xr−1. Thus the area under the graph can be
approximated by
This approximation becomes closer to the exact area as the number of strips is increased
and their widths decreased. In the limiting case as n →∞and ∆x →0 this leads to the
exact area being given by

(8.35)
In line with the deﬁnition of an integral, we note that if the graph of f(x) is below the 
x axis then the summation involves products of negative ordinates with positive widths,
so that areas below the x axis must be interpreted as being negative.
Example 8.37
By considering the area under the graph of y = x + 3, evaluate the integral 5
−5(x + 3)dx.
Solution
The area under the graph is shown hatched in Figure 8.47, with the area A1 being
negative, as explained immediately above, and the area A2 positive. So we determine
each area independently. In each case the areas are triangular, so that
A1 =
× 2 × 2 = −2
and
A2 =
× 8 × 8 = 32
Thus


The second term here is easy to evaluate since ∆xr−1 = xr −xr−1 and

(xr −xr−1) = b −a since x0 = a and
xn = b.
There are several different methods for evaluating the ﬁrst term. Here we shall illus-
trate one method; another method is set out in Question 98 of Exercises 8.7.3. We shall
use three different choices for xr*:

Mathematical modelling using integration
We have seen that the area under the graph y = f(x) can be expressed as an integral, but
integrals have a much wider application. Any quantity that can be expressed in the form
of the limit of a sum as in (8.35) can be represented by an integral, and this occurs in
many practical situations. Because areas can be expressed as integrals, it follows that
we can always interpret an integral geometrically as an area under a graph.
Example 8.39
What is the volume of a pyramid with square base, of side 4 metres and height 6 metres?
Solution
Imagine the pyramid of Figure 8.48(a) is cut into horizontal slices of thickness ∆h, as
shown in Figure 8.48(b), and then sum their volumes to give the volume of the pyramid.
From Figure 8.48(b) the volume of the slice is
∆Vk = area of square ﬂat face × thickness = 4d 2
k∆h
where 2dk is the length of one side of the square slice. The length of the side is related
to the height hk of the slice above the base, and using similar triangle relation (see 
Figure 8.48(c)) we have

vertical and has approximately the shape of a parabola, as shown in Figure 8.49. The
water pressure p (Pascals) varies with depth according to
p = p0 −gy + 10g
where p0 is the pressure at the surface, g is the acceleration due to gravity and y metres
is the height from the bottom of the parabola, as shown in the ﬁgure. Calculate the total
force acting on the wet face of the dam.

Solution
From the dimensions given in Figure 8.49 the equation of the parabola is 
, 
where x m is the half width. Dividing the surface of the parabola into horizontal strips
we can calculate the force acting on each strip and then sum these forces to obtain the
total force acting. The force ∆Fk acting on the strip at height yk is
∆Fk = (p0 −g8k + 10g)(26k∆yk)
where 6k and 8k are the average values of x and y on [yk, yk+1]. Thus, using (8.35), the
total force F newtons is given by

Later in Example 8.45 we will show that F = 200p0 + 800g.
Example 8.41
A beam of length l is freely hinged at both ends and carries a distributed load w(x) where
Show that the total load is W and ﬁnd the shear force at a point on the beam.
Solution
To ﬁnd the total load on the beam we divide the interval (0, l) into n subintervals of
length ∆x, so that xk = k∆x and ∆x = l/n. Then the load on the subinterval (xk, xk+1) is
w(x*k)∆x, where w(x*k) is the average value of w(x) in that subinterval. The total load on
the beam is the sum of all such elementary loads, and we have
This formula, while it is exact, is not very useful since we do not know the values of
the x*k’s. By proceeding to the limit, however, x*k →xk and we obtain the formula

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION

Now the integral l
0w(x)dx is the area under the curve y = w(x) between x = 0 and
x = l, and by considering the graph of w(x) shown in Figure 8.50 we see that this is W.
From the symmetry of the loading and the end conditions we see that the reactions
at the supports at both ends are equal (to R, say). Then the vertical forces must balance
for equilibrium, giving
2R = W
for equilibrium. To ﬁnd the shear force F we have to consider the vertical equilibrium
of the portion of the beam to the left of P. Thus
R + F = load between A and P which is represented by the area under the graph
between A and P

Deﬁnite and indeﬁnite integrals
We have seen that the area under the graph y = f(x) between x = a and x = b is given by
the integral

b
a
f(x)dx
Clearly, this area depends on the values of a and b as well as on the function f(x). Thus
the integral of a function f(x) may be regarded as a function of a and b. If we replace
the number b by the variable x, we obtain a function, F say, that is the area under the
graph between a and x, as shown in Figure 8.51. This type of integral is called an

indeﬁnite integral to distinguish it from integrals with ﬁxed a and b, which are called
deﬁnite integrals. We have deﬁned F by the relation
F(x) = 
x
a
f(t)dt
Notice here that the dummy variable t, used as the integrator, is chosen to be different
from the variable x on which the function F depends.
If a different lower limit is chosen, a different function is obtained, say G:
G(x) =
x
c
f(t)dt
By interpreting an integral as the area under a curve, we see from Figure 8.52 that this
new function differs from F only by a constant. This follows since
F(x) −G(x) =
x

f(t)dt −
x
c
f(t)dt =
c
a
f(t)dt
which is a deﬁnite integral having a constant value representing the area under the
graph between a and c, shown shaded in Figure 8.52.
For example, using the deﬁnition of an integral, we know (see Example 8.38) that

b

(t2 −1)dt =
(b3 −a3) −(b −a)
so that


DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
x3 −x + constant
When the lower limit is not speciﬁed, we denote the indeﬁnite integral by
 f(x)dx
or 
x
f(t)dt
and include the constant as an arbitrary constant of integration. Thus
(x2 −1)dx =
x3 −x + c
where c is the arbitrary constant of integration.
It is important to recognize that an indeﬁnite integral is itself a function, while a
deﬁnite integral is a number.
We noted in Section 8.2.4 that a function could only be differentiated at points where
its graph had a unique tangent, and that, for example, the function represented by the
graph of Figure 8.7(a), reproduced as Figure 8.53(a), is not differentiable at domain
values x = x1 and x = x2. However, such functions are integrable, with the corresponding
indeﬁnite integrals being functions having ‘smooth’ graphs. For example, the graph of
the indeﬁnite integral F(x) of the function f(x) shown in Figure 8.53(a) has the form
shown in Figure 8.53(b). For this reason, engineers often refer to integration as being a
‘smoothing’ process, and an integrator is frequently incorporated within a system design
in order to ensure ‘smoother’ operation.
We can express deﬁnite integrals in terms of indeﬁnite integrals. Thus

b
a
f(x)dx = g(b) −g(a)
where
g(x) = f(x)dx
This is often denoted by

b

f(x)dx = [g(x)]b

a notation introduced by Fourier. Thus, for example,

(x2 −1)dx = [ x3 −x + c] 5

When evaluating deﬁnite integrals, the constant of integration can be omitted, since
it cancels out in the arithmetic.

the above results may be combined to give
These results suggest a more general result:
The process of differentiation is the inverse of that of integration.
This conjecture is also supported by elementary applications of the processes. We
obtained the distance travelled by an object by integrating its velocity function. We
obtained the velocity of an object by differentiating its distance function. The general
result is called the Fundamental Theorem of Integral and Differential Calculus, and
may be stated in the form of the following theorem.

Theorem 8.1
The indeﬁnite integral F(x) of a continuous function f(x) always possesses a derivative
F′(x), and, moreover, F′(x) = f(x).
Proof
The formula for F(x) may be written as
F(x) =
x
a
f(t)dt,
where a is a constant
The quotient
may be written in terms of f(x) as
Consider the case when h is positive. The function f(x) is continuous, and so it is
bounded on [x, x + h]. Suppose it attains its upper bound at x1, as shown in Figure 8.54,
and its lower bound at x2. Then by considering the area under the graph, we see that
hf(x2) 
x
x+h
f(t)dt  hf(x1)
which implies that
f(x2)  
x
x+h
f(t)dt  f(x1)
or equivalently
As h →0, x2 →x and x1 →x, and we obtain the result
F′(x) = f(x)
(The proof when h is negative is similar.)

Techniques of integration
In this section we consider some of the methods available for determining the integrals
of functions. Again we shall concentrate on developing techniques, leaving problem-
solving applications for later in both this chapter and the rest of the book. The techni-
cal process of obtaining integrals is much more complicated than that of obtaining
derivatives. In the following sections the techniques for ﬁnding integrals are discussed,
but these techniques are often interconnected. It is strongly recommended that the 
student works through the examples, line by line, to gain experience in using these tech-
niques. The integrals of many functions cannot be expressed in terms of elementary
functions and sometimes these integrals themselves deﬁne new functions. An example
of this is the error function erf(x) deﬁned by
This occurs in the analysis of heat transfer. A related function also occurs in applied
statistics (see Section 13.5.3).

Integration as antiderivative
Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to some of the standard derivatives
deduced in Section 8.3, we deduce the integrals given in Figure 8.55. A more extensive
list is given in the Appendices A1.3 and A1.4. Note that we have used the notation
To help extend the number of functions that can be integrated analytically, using the
results of Figure 8.55, the following rules may be used.
Rule 1 (scalar-multiplication rule)
If k is a constant then
kf(x)dx = kf(x)dx
Rule 2 (sum rule)
[ f(x) ± g(x)]dx =f(x)dx ±g(x)dx

(b) Looking at the function, we see that because it involves a square root, its domain
is restricted to values of x  0. Multiplying through the brackets and using the scalar-

(2 −x)÷xdx = 2x 1/2 dx − x 3/2 dx

x3/2 −
x 5/2 + constant
(x  0)
(c) Examining the function, we see in this case that its domain is restricted to values of
x greater than or equal to 
. We note that the formula is the square root of a linear
function, and so we use the linear composite rule to obtain its integral. Thus, since
÷x dx =

we obtain

(d) In this case we see that the function is deﬁned except at x = 0. Expressing (x + 1)/x

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
MATLAB’s Symbolic Math Toolbox and MAPLE can evaluate both indeﬁnite and
deﬁnite integrals. If y = f(x) then the MATLAB command int(y) returns the
indeﬁnite integral of f(x), provided it exists in closed form. (Symbolic integration is
more difﬁcult than symbolic differentiation and difﬁculties can arise in computing
the integral.) Thus in MATLAB the indeﬁnite integral of y = f(x) is returned using
the commands
syms x y
y = f(x); int(y)
To determine the deﬁnite integral of y = f(x) from x = a to x = b the last command is
replaced by
int(y,a,b)
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are
y:= f(x); int(y,x); int(y,x = a..b);
Note that MATLAB and MAPLE do not supply a constant of integration when evalu-
ating indeﬁnite integrals. To illustrate, we consider Examples 8.42(a) and (c). For
Example 8.42(a) the commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
syms x y
y = 6*x^4 + 4*x – 3/x;
y:= 6*x^4 + 4*x – 3/x;
int(y);
int(y,x);
pretty(ans)
return the integral as
6/5x 5 + 2x 2 – 3log(x)
For Example 8.42(c) the commands
syms x y
y = sqrt(5*x + 2);
y:= sqrt(5*x + 2);
int(y);
int(y,x);
pretty(ans)
return the integral as
2/15(5x + 2)3/2
(5x + 2)(3/2)
For practice, check the answers to Examples 8.42(b) and (d) using MATLAB or
MAPLE.

We see from this last example that it is sometimes possible to integrate functions 
even if they have discontinuities. This is possible provided that there are only a ﬁnite
number of ﬁnite discontinuities within the domain of integration and that elsewhere 
the function is continuous and bounded. To illustrate this, consider the function f(x)
illustrated in Figure 8.58 where
Such a function is called a piecewise-continuous function. Interpreting the integral as
the area under the curve, we have

b
a
f(x)dx = A1 + A2 + A3
but in this case we interpret the individual areas as

b
a
f(x)dx =
where, as before, b1
−signiﬁes approaching b1 from the left and b1
+ signiﬁes approaching
b1 from the right (see Section 7.8.1). It is in this sense that we evaluated 0

Integration by parts
The product rule for differentiation
may also be used for integration after a little rearrangement. From the above we have
and on integrating we have
We may use this result to determine an integral when the integrand is the product of the
two functions. The method is called integration by parts. The procedure is to choose
one term of the product to be u and the other to be dv/dx. We then calculate du/dx and
v, and the hope is that the resulting integral on the right-hand side is easier than the one
we started with. We shall illustrate the method with a few examples.
Example 8.50
Find the indeﬁnite integrals of
(a) x ln x
(b) x2cos x
(c) exsin2x
Solution
(a) With this integral, we set
u = ln x
and
= x
giving
Note: There is no need to introduce a constant of integration when determining v.

(b) Since differentiation reduces the squared term to a linear one, leading to some
simpliﬁcation, we choose

x2 cos x dx = x2(sinx) −(sinx)(2x)dx = x2 sin x −2x sin x dx
We now apply the same technique to the last integral, taking
u = x
and
= sin x
to give
x sin x dx = (x)(−cos x) −(−cos x)(1)dx = −x cos x + sin x + constant
Substituting back gives
x2 cos x dx = x2sin x −2(−xcos x + sin x) + constant
= x2 sin x −2 sin x + 2x cos x + constant
(c) In this case it is not obvious that any choice of u and v will result in a simpler 
integral. Setting
u = sin2x
and
= ex
(only because integrating sin 2x will mean dividing by 2 and getting clumsy fractions!)
gives

exsin2x dx = exsin2x −ex(2cos2x)dx
= exsin 2x −2excos2x dx
which has produced no simpliﬁcation at all. We repeat the process, however, on the last
integral, taking care to integrate the part we integrated the ﬁrst time and to differentiate
the part we differentiated the ﬁrst time. Thus we take
u = cos2x
and
= ex
giving
excos2x dx = excos2x −ex(−2 sin 2x)dx
= excos2x + 2exsin2x dx
Substituting in the previous expression, we obtain
exsin 2x dx
Hence
5exsin2x dx = ex(sin2x −2 cos 2x)
so
exsin2x dx =
ex(sin2x −2 cos 2x) + constant
For Example 8.50(b) the MATLAB commands
syms x y
y = (x^2)*cos(x); int(y); pretty(ans)
return the integral as x 2sin(x) – 2sin(x) + 2xcos(x), which checks with the
given solution.

Integration using the general composite rule
The composite-function rule for differentiation
[ f(g(x))] = f ′(g(x))g′(x)
can be used to evaluate some integrals. Reversing the differentiation process, we 
may write
 f ′(g(x))g′(x)dx = f(g(x)) + constant
The key step here is identifying the function g(x). This will not be unique: different
choices of g(x) may differ by a constant. To make the process of manipulation easier to
follow, it is usual to set t = g(x), so that the integral becomes
 f ′(g(x))g′(x)dx = f ′(t)
dx = f ′(t)dt = f(t) + constant
= f(g(x)) + constant
(on back substitution)
which is the composite function rule for integration.
This technique for evaluating integrals is called the substitution method; we shall
illustrate its use with a number of examples.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
Solution
(a) Comparison with the general form above suggests that we take
g(x) = x2 + 3,
with g′(x) = 2x
Setting t = x2 + 3 so that 
= 2x, the integral becomes
=
t3/2 + constant =
(x2 + 3)3/2 + constant
(b) Comparison with the general form suggests that we choose
g(x) = x2 + 2x + 2,
with g′(x) = 2x + 2
This necessitates a slight modiﬁcation of the integral giving
where t = x2 + 2x + 2 and dt = (2x + 2)dx. Thus
Comment
This example is a special case of a commonly occurring form when the integrand 
can be written as
so that the integral is the logarithm of the denominator.

Integration using partial fractions
In this section, we consider the use of partial fractions in evaluating integrals of ratio-
nal functions. Partial fractions, discussed earlier in Section 2.5.1, are so frequently used
to evaluate such integrals that one talks of the partial fraction method of integration.
Example 8.52
Using partial fractions, evaluate the integrals
(a)
(b)
(c)
Solution
(a) Factorizing the denominator as x 2 −2x −8 = (x + 2)(x −4), we can express the 
integrand in terms of its partial fractions:
Thus
= −ln | x + 2 | + ln | x −4 | + constant
(b) In partial fractions we have

Setting x = −1 gives 1 = A
Setting x = 0
gives 1 = 2A + C giving C = −1

gives 1 = 5A + 2B + 2C giving B = −1
Thus

Solution
Expressing the integrand as partial fractions, we have
Thus

Comparing coefﬁcients of each power of x gives
x0 : B + D = 2
x1 : A + C + 2D = 0
x2 : B + D + 2C = 0
x3 : A + C = 0
from which we deduce A = 1, B = 2, C = −1 and D = 0. Thus

Integration involving the circular and hyperbolic functions
We have seen in many examples earlier in the chapter how a carefully chosen rearrange-
ment of the integrand makes it possible to evaluate non-standard integrals. This re-
arrangement method is widely used to ﬁnd integrals of products of sines and cosines.
This makes use of the trigonometric sum identities (Section 2.6.4) as well as the rules
of integration. The same techniques are used with the hyperbolic sines and cosines.
Example 8.55
Find the indeﬁnite integrals of
(a) cos2x
(b) sin(5x + 1)cos(x + 2)
Solution
(a) First we express cos2x in terms of cos 2x using the identity
cos 2x = 2 cos2x −1
So cos2x dx = (cos 2x + 1)dx
=
sin 2x +
x + constant
(b) First we express the product as the sum of two sine terms
sin(5x + 1)cos(x + 2) =
[sin(6x + 3) + sin(4x −1)]
Then we evaluate the integral using the rules of integration
sin(5x + 1)cos(x + 2)dx = −
cos(6x + 3) −
cos(4x −1) + constant
In other examples we make use of the general composite function rule and of integra-
tion by parts.

8.8 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION
657
Example 8.56
Find the indeﬁnite integrals of
(a) sin3x cos2x
(b) tan x
Solution
(a) Here we can rewrite the product as
sin x(1 −cos2x)cos2x
So we have the integral
sin3x cos2x dx =(cos2x sin x −cos4x sin x)dx
Now 
(cos x) = −sin x, so using the general composite rule we have
sin3x cos2x dx = −cos3 x +
cos5x + constant
(b) Here, again, we notice that 
(cos x) = −sin x, to obtain
and since 
= sec x, we may write this as
tan x dx = ln sec x + constant
Sometimes using different methods to ﬁnd an integral may give results that appear dif-
ferent but only differ by a constant.
Example 8.57
Find the indeﬁnite integrals of
(a) sinh 5x cosh 2x
(b) sech x
Solution
(a) Here we rewrite the integrand as (sinh 7x + sinh 3x) to obtain

cosh 7x +
cosh 3x + constant

Exercises 2.6.9) that

Integration by substitution
Sometimes it is possible to simplify an integral by means of a change of integrating
variable. This uses the composite-function rule (Section 8.8.6) in a slightly different
way. This is illustrated in Example 8.58.

8.8 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION
659
Example 8.58
Find the indeﬁnite integral
Solution
The source of the difﬁculty with this integral is the square-root term in the denominator.
We try to simplify the integral by the substitution t = ÷(1 −x). Thus x = 1 −t2 and 
dx/dt = −2t, giving
= 4 ln(2 + t) −2t + constant
= 4 ln[2 + ÷(1 −x)] −2÷(1 −x) + constant
The choice of such substitutions is not always immediately obvious. We shall consider
a further example and then give a list of substitutions commonly used to simplify 
integrals.
Example 8.59
Find the indeﬁnite integral ÷(1 −x2)dx, 0  x  1.
Solution
Based on our experience with Example 8.51, we are tempted to try to remove the
square-root term using the substitution
u = ÷(1 −x2)
Then u2 = 1 −x2 and 2u = −2x dx/du, so that
giving
which leaves us with an integral more complicated than the one with which we started.
Thus in this case the simple substitution does not work, and we need to look for a
more sophisticated substitution, bearing in mind that what we wish to do is to remove
the awkward square-root term ÷(1 −x2). Noting that cos2θ = 1 −sin2θ we try the 
substitution x = sinθ, so that
= cos θ, giving

which looks simpler than the original integral but is not immediately integrable.
Using the double-angle trigonometric identity (see 2.27c)
cos2θ = 2 cos2θ −1
we obtain
This gives the answer in terms of θ rather than the original variable x. Since θ = sin−1x,
back substitution gives
or, since sin 2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ = 2 sinθ÷(1 −sin2θ), we may write this in the alternative
form
Figure 8.59 shows a number of substitutions that are often used in the evaluation of
f(x)dx. This list is not exhaustive. There are many special cases, some of which are
given in Exercises 8.8.14.
When using substitution methods with deﬁnite integrals, it is usually best to change
the limits of the integral when the integrating variable is changed. This saves returning
to the original variable, which can sometimes be very tedious. In general, setting 
x = g(t) gives

Substitutions for
evaluation of f(x)dx.
Example 8.60
Using the substitution u = ÷(x + 2), evaluate the deﬁnite integral
Solution
Setting u = ÷(x + 2), or u2 = x + 2, gives 2udu = dx. Regarding limits, when x = −2,
u = 0 and when x = 2, u = ÷4 = 2.

Making the substitution gives
= 4 −π
For Example 8.58 the MATLAB commands
syms x y
y = 1/(2 + sqrt(1 – x)); int(y); pretty(ans)
return the integral as
2log(–x – 3) – 2(1 – x)1/2 – 2log(–2 + (1 – x)1/2)
+ 2log(2 + (1 – x)1/2)
Some algebraic manipulation is necessary to obtain the answer in the form given in
the solution. Collecting the log terms gives
−2(1 −x)1/2 + 2log
Multiplying ‘top and bottom’ of the log term by (2 + (1 −x)1/2) and subsequent
cancelling of the (−x −3) term gives the answer in the form given in the solution.
The corresponding MAPLE commands
y:= 1/(2 + sqrt(1 – x)); int(y,x);
return the integral as
2ln(–x – 3) – 2÷(1 – x) + 4arctanh (
÷(1 – x))
Using the command
convert(%, ln);
the answer is expressed in the logarithmic form
2ln(–x – 3) – 2÷(1 – x) + 2ln(2 + ÷(1 – x))
– 2ln(2 – ÷(1 – x))
This example clearly emphasizes the fact that integrals can be the same even if they
look totally different.

Integration involving –(ax2 + bx + c)
We have seen in many examples that the use of the linear composite rule combined with
standard integrals enables us to evaluate many integrals, including ones involving terms
like ÷(ax2 + bx + c). In this section we will deal with several integrals of that type.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION

8.8 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION
663
Example 8.61
Find the indeﬁnite integrals of the following functions
(a) ÷(x2 + 6x −7)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e) x÷(x2 + 4x −3)
(f) ÷(3 + 2x −2x2)
Solution
(a) First we complete the square of the term inside the square root
÷(x2 + 6x −7) dx =÷[(x + 3)2 −16] dx
Using the table (Figure 8.59), we select the substitution
(x + 3) = 4 cosh u,
so that 
= 4 sinh u and
÷(x2 + 6x −7) dx =÷[(16 cosh2 u −16)] 4 sinh u du
Now cosh2u −1 = sinh2u, and the integral becomes
16sinh2u du = 16 (cosh 2u −1)du = 4 sinh 2u −8u + constant
Since cosh u = (x + 3)/4 we deduce that sinh u = ÷(cosh2 −1); that is, sinh u =
and
sinh 2u = 2sinh u cosh u =
Also u = cosh−1(
) and hence
÷(x2 + 6x −7) dx = (x + 3)÷(x2 + 6x −7) −8 cosh−1
+ constant
(b) Using the same approach, we have
Setting x −
=
cosh u, so that 
=
sinh u, the integral becomes 
since cosh2u −1 = sinh2u. Thus
=1du = u + c, where cosh u =
(x −
)
Hence
= cosh−1

(c) Rewriting the integrand gives
Setting x −1 =
sinh u, so that 
=
cosh u, the integral becomes 
since sinh2u + 1 = cosh2u. Thus
, where sinh u =
Hence
(d) Here we notice that
so we ﬁrst rewrite the integrand as 
and the integral as
The ﬁrst term may be evaluated at once as 2÷(x2 + 4x + 9).
The second term is rewritten as 
.
Using the substitution x + 2 = ÷5 sinh u, the reader should show that the value of this
integral is sinh−1(
). Hence
(e) Here x2 + 4x −3 = (x + 2)2 −7, so we choose the substitution x + 2 = ÷7 cosh u.
Hence

Applications of integration
Integration is widely used in engineering applications. In this section we consider some
situations in which integration is used.
8.9.1
Volume of a solid of revolution
Imagine rotating the plane area A under the graph of the function f(x), x  [a, b],
of Figure 8.60 through a complete revolution about the x axis. The result would be to
generate a solid having the x axis as axis of symmetry, as shown in Figure 8.61(a): this
is called a solid of revolution. If we wish to determine the volume of this solid, we 
proceed as in Section 8.7.1 and subdivide the rotating area into n vertical strips. When
a typical strip within the subinterval [xr−1, xr] is rotated through a revolution about the 
x axis, it will generate a thin disc of radius f(x*r) (with xr−1  x*r  xr) and thickness 
∆xr−1, as shown in Figure 8.61(b). The volume of the disc is given by
∆Vr = π[ f(x*r )]2 ∆xr−1
Figure 8.60
Plane area rotated.

8.9 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
667
Thus the volume of the solid can be approximated by
Again this approximation is closer to the exact volume as the number of strips is
increased. Thus in the limiting case as n →∞and ∆x →0, ∆x =
∆xr; it leads to
the volume being given by
(8.36)
8.9.2
Centroid of a plane area
Consider the plane region of Figure 8.62(a) bounded between the graphs of the two
continuous functions f(x) and g(x) on the interval x  [a, b], with g(x)  f(x) on the
interval. The area A of this region is clearly given by
A = area under the graph of f(x) – area under the graph of g(x)

Figure 8.62

We now wish to ﬁnd the coordinates (x, y) of the centroid of this area. To do this, 
we take moments of area about the x and y axes in turn. As before, we subdivide the
region into n strips, with a typical strip in the subinterval [xr−1, xr] being shown in 
Figure 8.62(b). The area of the strip is
∆Ar = [ f(x*r ) −g(x*r )]∆xr−1
and the moment of this area about the y axis is
∆Myr = x*r ∆Ar = x*r [ f(x*r ) −g(x*r )]∆xr−1
Thus the sum of the moments of the n strips about the y axis is
Proceeding to the limit n →∞, ∆x →0, ∆x =
∆xr, we have the moment of the
plane area about the y axis being given by
Because the ‘x’ in the integrand is raised to the power ‘1’, this is termed the ﬁrst
moment of the area about the y axis. Since the x coordinate of the centroid of the plane
area is x, it follows that the moment of the area about the y axis is also given by
My = Ax
Equating, we have
x = 

a
x[ f(x) −g(x)]dx
(8.38)
where the area A is given by (8.37).
Likewise, taking moments about the x axis,

y =

b
a
{[ f(x)]2 −[g(x)]2}dx
(8.39)
where A again is given by (8.37).
In the particular case when g(x) is the x axis, we ﬁnd that the centroid of the plane
area bounded by f(x) (x [a, b]) and the x axis has coordinates

Centre of gravity of a solid of revolution
Proceeding as in Section 8.9.2, we can obtain the coordinates (X, Y) of the centre 
of gravity of the solid of revolution generated by f(x) (x  [a, b]) and shown in 
Figure 8.58. By symmetry, it lies on the x axis, so that
Y = 0
Taking moments about the y axis gives

giving

(8.42)
where the volume V is given by (8.36).
8.9.4
Mean values
In many engineering applications we need to know the mean value of a continuously
varying quantity. When dealing with a sequence of values we can compute the mean
value simply by adding the values together and then dividing by the number of values
taken. When dealing with a continuously varying quantity, we cannot do that directly.
Using integration, however, we are able to calculate the mean value.
Consider the function f(x) on the interval [a, b] and divide the interval into n equal
strips of width h so that nh = b −a. Now evaluate the function at the midpoint of
each strip. Formally, let xk = a + kh be the points of subdivision, so that the points of
evaluation are f(x*
k ) where x*
k = xk + h/2. Then the mean value (m.v.) of f(x) on [a, b] is
approximately
Now allowing n →∞(with h →0), the summation becomes an integral and the
approximation becomes exactly true. Thus
m.v.( f(x)) =

b
a
f(x)dx
(8.43)
The graphical representation of this makes the situation quite clear. In Figure 8.63, the
sum of the shaded areas above the line y = (mean value) is equal to the sum of the
shaded areas below it, so that the area of the rectangle ABCD is the same as the area
between the curve and the x axis.
8.9.5
Root mean square values
In some contexts the computation of the mean value of a function is not useful, for
example the mean of an alternating current is zero but that does not imply it is not

dangerous! To deal with such situations we use the root mean square (r.m.s.) of the
function f(x). Literally this is the square root of the mean value of [ f(x)]2. Thus we can
write
[r.m.s.(f(x))]2 =

[ f(x)]2 dx
(8.44)
Although the obvious applications of root mean square values are in electrical engineer-
ing, they also occur in the application of statistics to engineering contexts (as standard
deviations of continuously distributed random variables). They also occur in the design
of gyroscopes and in mechanics, where the ‘radius of gyration’ is in effect the root mean
of moments about an axis.
8.9.6
Arclength and surface area
In many practical problems we are required to work out the length of a curve or the
surface area generated by rotating a curve. The formula for the length s of a curve with
formula y = f(x) between two points corresponding to x = a and x = b is obtained using
the basic idea of integration. Let ∆sk be the element of arclength between x = xk and
x = xk+1. Then for a curve that is concave upwards, as in Figure 8.64, we deduce that
∆xksecθk  ∆sk  ∆xksecθk+1
where θk and θk+1 are the angles of slope made by the tangents to the curve at Pk and Pk+1.
Thus the length s of the curve between x = a and x = b satisﬁes the inequality
Letting n →∞and max ∆xk →0 yields the inequality

secθdx
A similar analysis for curves that are concave downwards yields the same result.
We can express secθ in terms of dy/dx by means of the identity
sec2θ = 1 + tan2θ
Here tan θ = dy/dx, so, using the convention that s increases with x, we obtain
so that the length of the curve is
(8.45)
The surface area S generated by s when it is rotated through 2π radians about the x axis
is calculated in a similar way. The element of arc ∆sk generates an element of surface
area ∆Sk, where
∆Sk = 2πyk∆sk
where yk is the average value of y between yk = f (xk) and yk+1 = f(xk+1). Thus the total 
surface area is given by
(8.46)

rotated through 2π radians about the x axis. Calculate

Find the equation of the curve described by a heavy cable hanging, without load, under
gravity, from two equally high points.
Solution
Consider the cable illustrated in Figure 8.69. Let T be the tension acting at a point P that
is a horizontal distance x from the axis of symmetry, as shown, and let the tangent to
the curve at P make an angle θ to the horizontal. If s is the length of the curve between
A and P, and T0 is the tension at A, then resolving the forces acting on the length of
cable between A and P horizontally and vertically gives
T0 = T cosθ

sρg = T sinθ

This is known as the intrinsic equation of the curve, where c = T0/ρg. In terms of x and
y, this equation, using (8.45), implies that the co-ordinates of P satisfy
To solve this equation to obtain the equation of the curve, we ﬁrst differentiate it with
respect to x, giving
with dy/dx = 0 at x = 0. This may be rewritten as
and integrating with respect to x, using the substitution dy/dx = sinhu, and remembering
that (d/dx)(dy/dx) = d2y/dx2, gives
Since dy/dx = 0 at x = 0, we deduce that A = 0 and
This is easy to integrate, giving
The value of B is ﬁxed by the value of y at x = 0. This may be chosen quite arbitrarily with-
out changing the shape of the curve. Choosing y(0) = c gives a neat answer (with B = 0):
Note that this curve, called the catenary, is different from the shape of the cable of a
suspension bridge, which is a parabola. The catenary has many applications, including
the design of roofs and arches.

Moments of inertia
We have seen in Section 7.9.2 that moments of inertia occur in the design of structures
involving beams. They also occur in the mechanics of rotating parts of machinery and
in the design of ships. The formal deﬁnition of a moment of inertia of an object about
an axis is its second moment of mass about that axis. The simplest case to consider is
that of a plane rectangular area of sides a and b, with mass per unit area ρ, as shown in
Figure 8.70(a).
The elementary strip PQ has mass ρb∆x and its second moment of mass about OY
is x2ρb∆x. The moment of inertia IOY of the rectangle about OY is the sum of all such
second moments. Thus

Numerical evaluation of integrals
In many practical problems the functions that have to be integrated are often speciﬁed
by a graph or by a table of values. Even when the function is given analytically, it
often cannot be integrated to give an answer in terms of simple functions. Also, in many
engineering and scientiﬁc problems it is often known in advance that the value of an
integral is only required to a certain precision and the use of an approximate method 
can avoid considerable unwanted labour. In all these cases we have to evaluate the 
integrals numerically. There are many ways of doing this, varying from the simplest
square-counting for working out the area under a graph to sophisticated computer 
procedures. In this section we shall develop a simple numerical method known as the
trapezium rule, which is the basis of many computer algorithms, and a hand computa-
tion method known as Simpson’s rule.
8.10.1
The trapezium rule
The simplest methods return to the initial ideas about integration introduced in
Section 8.7.1. As indicated in Figure 8.71, they involve slicing up the area to be found
into a number of strips of equal width, approximating the area of each strip in some
way; the sum of these approximations then gives the ﬁnal numerical result.
The points of subdivision of the domain of integration [a, b] are labelled x0, x1, … ,
xn, where x0 = a, xn = b, xr = x0 + rh (r = 0, 1, 2, … , n), and the width of each strip
is h = (b −a)/n. The value of the integrand f(x) at these points is, as usual, denoted by
fr = f(xr). A basic method for numerical integration approximates the area of each strip
by the area of the trapezium formed when the upper end is replaced by the chord of the
graph, as shown in Figure 8.72.

From Figure 8.72 we can see that the approximate area of the rth strip is
( fr + fr+1)h
so that
=
[( f0 + f1) + ( f1 + f2) + … + ( fn−1 + fn)]
That is,
(8.47)
This approximation method is called the trapezium rule. As we shall see below, the
best method for using it is given in formula (8.48).
Example 8.69
Evaluate the integral 1
2(1/x)dx to 5dp, using the trapezium rule.
Solution
This integral is one of the standard integrals given in Figure 8.55, and so can be evalu-
ated analytically. Its value is ln2 = 0.693147 to 6dp. This enables us, in this illustrative
example, to check our methods. Usually, of course, the value of the integral is not
known beforehand, and assessing the accuracy of the estimate obtained using the
trapezium rule is an important aspect of the evaluation.
The ﬁrst decision to be made in the numerical procedure is that of how many strips
should be used; that is, what value n should have. A large number of strips may yield
a good approximation to each strip, but will involve a lot of calculation, with the 
possibility of consequent rounding error accumulation. A small number of strips will
obviously involve a large error in the approximation to the area of each strip. We shall
investigate the situation.

First of all, we shall introduce the notation T(h) to denote the approximation to the
value of the integral given by the trapezium rule using strips of width h. Obviously,
ignoring the possible effects of rounding errors, we expect
Taking n = 1 gives h = (2 −1)/n = 1, x0 = 1 and x1 = 2. This gives the estimate 
Here f0 = 1 and f1 = 0.5, so that T(1) = 0.75. This estimate for the value of the integral
has an error of 0.75 −0.693 = +0.057.
Taking n = 2 gives h = 0.5, x0 = 1, x2 = 2 and x1 = 1.5. Note that x0 and x2 are the two
points used before, but now relabelled. This gives the estimate
T(0.5) = (0.5)[ f1 +
( f0 + f2)]
where f0 = 1, f1 = 0.666 667 and f2 = 0.5, so that T(0.5) = 0.708333. This estimate has
an error of +0.015, so by doubling the number of strips, we have reduced the error by
a factor of nearly four.
Taking n = 4 gives h = 0.25, x0 = 1, x4 = 2, x1 = 1.25, x2 = 1.5 and x3 = 1.75. Note
that three of these points were used in the previous calculation. This value of n gives
the estimate
T(0.25) = (0.25)[ f1 + f2 + f3 +
( f0 + f4)]
where f0 = 1, f1 = 0.8, f2 = 0.666 667, f3 = 0.571429 and f4 = 0.5, so that T(0.25) =
0.697024. This estimate has an error of +0.004, so by doubling the number of strips,
we have again reduced the error by a factor of four.
Continuing this process, with n = 8, we obtain the estimate T(0.125) = 0.694 122,
with an error of +0.001.
Based on these four calculations, we can estimate the values of n and h that will give
an answer correct to 5dp; that is, with an absolute error less than 0.000005. If we 
continue the process of doubling the number of strips, reducing the error by a factor of
four each time, we shall obtain an answer with the required accuracy when n = 128.
With this large number of strips, we clearly need to organize the calculation to do it as
economically as possible. Looking back at the previous calculations, we see that at each
new value of n we almost double the number of points at which the integrand has to 
be evaluated, but as can be seen from Figure 8.73, at half of these points it has been
evaluated in previous calculations.
Taking into account the effect of interval-halving on h, we can reduce the amount of
calculation to evaluate T(h) by making use of the result obtained for T(2h):
T(h) = h[ f1 + f2 + f3 + … + fn−1 +
( f0 + fn)],
T(2h) = (2h)[ f2 + f4 + … + fn−2 +
( f0 + fn)]

Here f0, f2, f4, … , fn were all calculated previously, in the evaluation of T(2h).
Rearranging, we have
T(h) = h( f1 + f3 + f5 + … + fn−1) +
(2h)[ f2 + f4 + … + fn−2 +
( f0 + fn)]
Thus
T(h) = h( f1 + f3 + f5 + … + fn−1) +
T(2h)
(8.48)
(remembering that if h is the strip width for n intervals then 2h is the strip width for
n intervals).
This formula enables us to perform the calculations economically, but we can
exploit it in a more subtle way.
We have seen that halving the strip width reduces the error by a factor of approxi-
mately four. This means that the error is proportional to h2. In fact, this behaviour is 
typical of the application of the trapezium rule to the evaluation of many kinds of 
integrals, and we can use it to obtain a more accurate estimate of the value of the integral.
Since the error is proportional to h2, we can write
where h = 1/n and A is some number that, in general, will depend upon n but will remain
bounded as n becomes large. A similar formula holds for T(2h):
where h has the same value as before and A′  A. These two formulae enable us to
estimate the error in the approximation for the integral. Subtracting them gives
3Ah2  T(2h) −T(h)
so that the approximation T(h) to the integral has an error estimate of [T(2h) −T(h)].
Thus in the calculation above the estimated error for T(0.125) is
(0.697 024 −0.694122) = +0.000 967
as we found before. This means that we can estimate the error in the usual situation of
not knowing (unlike in this example) the true value of the integral. It also enables us

to obtain a better approximation. Subtracting the estimated error from T(h) gives the
improved approximation (Richardson’s extrapolation)
Alternatively we may write
Using the values for T(0.25) and T(0.125) obtained above, we have
which is correct to 5dp. In general, of course, we could not know how good an approx-
imation this extrapolated value is, and the usual practice is to continue interval-halving
until two successive extrapolated values agree to the accuracy required. Not all integrals
will converge as quickly as in this example. For example, 1
0÷x dx requires a large 
number of evaluations to achieve reasonable accuracy. The reason for the slow con-
vergence of the approximation to 1
0÷x dx compared with that of 2
1(1/x)dx is readily
seen from Figure 8.74.

given solution.
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are:
with(student):
y:= f(x): trapezoid(y, x = a..b, n): evalf (%);
Example 8.70
Evaluate the integral 1
0÷(1 + x2)dx to 5dp, using the trapezium rule and extrapolation.
Solution
As before, we begin with just one strip, so that h = 1 and T(1) =
( f0 + f1), where 
f0 = f(x0) = f(0) = 1.000 000 and f1 = f(x1) = f(1) = 1.414 214. Thus T(1) = 1.207 107.
Next we set h = , and we calculate one new value of the integrand at x = , giving a
new f1 =
÷5 = 1.118 034 and
T(0.5) = hf1 +
T(1)
= 0.5 × 1.118 034 + 0.603 554
= 1.162 570
An estimate for the error in T(0.5) is
[T(1) −T(0.5)] = 0.014 846
and a better approximation for the value of the integral is given by
1.162 570 −0.014 846 = 1.147 724
Next we interval-halve again, giving h = 0.25, and calculate new values of the integrand
(at x = 0.25 and x = 0.75):
f1 = f(0.25) = 1.030 776
and
f3 = f(0.75) = 1.25
Thus
T(0.25) = h( f1 + f3) +
T(0.5) = 1.151 479
with an error estimate of [T(0.5) −T(0.25)] = 0.003697 and an extrapolated value
1.151 479 −0.003 697 = 1.147 782
At this stage we can see that the value of the integral is 1.148 to 3dp. We continue 
interval-halving, giving: for h = 0.125, T(0.125) = 1.148714, with an error estimate 
of 0.000922 and an extrapolated value 1.147793; and for h = 0.0625, T(0.0625) =
1.148714, with an error estimate of 0.000230 and an extrapolated value 1.147793.
Thus the extrapolated values agree to 6dp, so that we can write

Simpson’s rule
The interval-halving algorithm developed in Section 8.10.1 is the appropriate algorithm
to use for automatic computation. It is easy to program and is computationally efﬁcient
when used with extrapolation. It is, however, cumbersome for hand computation. For
pencil and paper calculations a method that has been commonly used is equivalent to
the extrapolated result obtained in Section 8.10.1 but does not give any estimate of error
or permit easy interval-halving to check the accuracy of the result.
The trapezium rule approximation to a
b f(x)dx using one strip is
T1 =
(b −a)[ f(a) + f(b)]
and that using two strips is
The extrapolation based on these two estimates is
S = [4T2 −T1]/3
The formula provides the basic approximation for the area under the curve between
x = a and x = b. It can be shown to be the area under the parabola which passes through
the three points (a, f(a)), ((a + b)/2, f((a + b)/2)) and (b, f(b)).
Now consider the interval [a, b] divided into n equal strips of width h where n is an
even number. Then we may write
where xk = a + kh.
Applying the basic formula to each of the integrals on the right-hand side yields the
approximation

or in words
The integral is approximately one-third the step size times the sum of four 
times the odd ordinates plus twice the even ordinates plus ﬁrst and last 
ordinates.
This is referred to as Simpson’s rule and a pencil and paper calculation would be set
out as shown in Example 8.71.
There is no command in MATLAB for implementing Simpson’s rule (8.49), in
which the number of strips is speciﬁed. Instead the package incorporates the com-
mand quad(f,a,b), which tries to approximate the integral of the scalar-valued
function f = f(x) from a to b to within an error of 1.e−6 using recursive adaptive
Simpson quadrature. There is no need to specify the number of strips and the method
is somewhat hidden from the user. It is an efﬁcient approach to evaluate an integral
numerically but is of limited value as a learning tool. When using the quad
command the function f(x) must be expressed as an inline function with the array
operations .*,./ and .^ used in its speciﬁcation, so that it can be evaluated with a
vector argument. As an illustration we consider the integral of Example 8.69, for
which the commands
f = inline(‘(1 + x.^2).^(1/2)’); quad(f, 0,1)
return the answer 1.1478.
In MAPLE, Simpson’s rule (8.49) is evaluated by the commands
with(student):
f:= x–>f(x); simpson(f(x),x = a..b,n); evalf(%);
For the integral of Example (8.69) the commands
with(student):
f:= 1/x; simpson(f,x = 1..2,8); evalf(%);
return the answer .6931545307.
MAPLE also has the facility to produce a sequence of answers corresponding to
an array of values for the number of strips; for example the commands
nn = [4,8,12];
seq(evalf(simpson(1/x,x = 1..2,n)),n = nn);
return the sequence of answers
.6932539681, .6931545307, .6931486622
This facility provides a valuable learning tool; it is also available for the trapezium
rule using the command
seq(evalf(trapezoidal(1/x,x = 1..2,n)), n = nn);

Example 8.71
Figure 8.75 shows a longitudinal section PQ of rough ground through which a straight
horizontal road is to be cut. The width of the road is to be 10 m, and the sides of the
cutting and embankment slope at 2 horizontal to 1 vertical. Estimate the net volume of
earth removed in making the road.

Cross-section with
distances above or
below datum at 200 m
intervals (not to scale).
Solution
In this case we are not dealing with a solid of revolution, and so cannot use (8.36) to
ﬁnd the volume. Instead, we slice the volume up, estimate the volume of each slice and
then add all the individual volumes together, as illustrated in Section 8.7.1. The volume
above the datum PQ is counted as positive and that below the datum as negative, so that
inﬁll on site is accounted for automatically.
Consider the ‘slice’ between the points at distances x and x + ∆x from P, as shown
in Figure 8.76. The volume of this slice is A∆x where A is the average cross-sectional
area between x and x + ∆x. The cross-sectional area A depends on the height h of the
soil above the datum line PQ. This relationship is given by
A = (2h + 10)h
as shown in Figure 8.77.
The height h depends on the distance x along the road, so that we can construct a
table of values for A as a function of x, as shown in Figure 8.78.

Using Simpson’s rule with 10 strips of width 200m, the calculation is shown in
Figure 8.79 and we obtain the estimate 7.3 × 104 m3. If a better estimate is required,
more data will have to be collected.

Engineering application: design of prismatic channels
The mean velocity V of ﬂow in straight prismatic channels is proportional to (A/p)r, where
A is the cross-sectional area of the ﬂow, p is the wetted perimeter and r is approximately
a constant (
). Given the channel section for minimum ﬂows (that is, A0 and p0), the
objective is to design a channel such that V has the same value for all larger discharges.
Assume a symmetric channel cross-section as shown in Figure 8.80, where A0 and
p0 are the minimum ﬂow values of A and p. Let the shape of the channel be given by
x = f(y). (Note that in this application y, the height of the surface above the datum line,
is the independent variable.) Then we want to ﬁnd the function f(y) such that the mean
ﬂow velocity is independent of y. This implies because it is proportional to (A/p)r that

where x = f(y) and h  0.
Using (8.45), the wetted perimeter p is given by

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
Since this is true for all h  0, it implies that the integrand must be identically zero.
Thus x = f(y) satisﬁes the differential equation
which, assuming 
 0, implies
(8.50)
Integrating with respect to y then gives
Using the substitution cosh u = (p0x/A0) on the left-hand side gives
If the channel has width 2b where y = 0, we can obtain the value of the constant of
integration c as
and deduce the formula for a suitable channel shape as
This solution, however, is not unique and we note that the differential equation
(8.50) is also satisﬁed by
As an exercise, use this information to show that the general solution may take the form
of either of the cross-sections shown in Figures 8.81(a) and (b). Notice that the line

Engineering application: harmonic analysis of 
periodic functions
Periodic functions occur frequently in practical problems and in natural phenomena like
tidal systems. Rotating parts of machinery produce vibrations, which may become dan-
gerous when resonance occurs. Indeed such a resonance led to the failure of the Tacoma
Road bridge (see Section 10.10.3). Periodic motions usually involve several frequen-
cies of vibrations at the same time and the method of ﬁnding the amplitude of each fre-
quency is called harmonic analysis (see also Chapter 12).
Consider, for example, the crank and connecting rod mechanism discussed in
Example 2.44. The displacement function of the slider is
y = r cos x + ÷(l 2 −r 2 sin2x)
where r is the radius of the crank, l the length of the connecting rod and x (radians) is
the angle turned through. The motion is periodic but is not a simple sinusoid. It involves
many harmonics and we may write
y = a0 + a1 cos x + a2 cos 2x + a3 cos 3x + …
where the a’s are constants and we choose a cosine series since y is an even function
y(−x) = y(x). To simplify the problem, we take a special case with r = 1 and l = 3. Then
y = cos x + ÷(8 + cos2x)
A graph of y is shown in Figure 8.82.
The displacement y has period 2π and its mean value 8 is given by
The contribution of cos x to the value of the integral over a complete period is zero, so
this simpliﬁes to

y = cos x + ÷(8 + cos2x)

This integral cannot be evaluated analytically. Using the trapezium rule with step sizes
π/2, π/4 and π/8, together with Richardson’s extrapolation, we obtain
8 = 2.9148
We now seek an approximation to y(x) having the form
y(x)  8 + cos x + a cos 2x
such that the integral of the squared error over a complete period is as small as poss-
ible. That is, a is chosen so that
Expanding the integrand this gives
This tidies up to
The ﬁrst integral inside the curly brackets is independent of a, and so differentiates to
zero. The second integral is zero in value and the last integral has value π. Thus differ-
entiating with respect to a gives
Hence
a =
Evaluating this integral numerically gives a = 0.0858. Investigating the difference
between the approximation and y over a complete period shows that the size of the 
maximum error is less than 0.0007.

The numerical procedures developed in this

strips of equal width. An alternative procedure is 
to specify the number of tabular points to be used

Introduction
In Chapter 8 we discussed the fundamental ideas and concepts of integral and differ-
ential calculus and applied them to various practical problems. We also developed 
techniques for solving problems using calculus. In this chapter we shall extend the tech-
niques developed in Chapter 8 to deal with a wide range of problems and develop the
theory to enable us to understand the numerical techniques widely used in practical
problem-solving. We shall introduce multivariable calculus and use it to solve problems
in optimization.
9.2
Improper integrals
When we considered the deﬁnite integral a
b f(x)dx in Chapter 8 and showed its equival-
ence with an area under a curve, it was assumed that the integrand f(x) was continuous,
or at least piecewise-continuous, over the closed domain of integration [a, b]. To illus-
trate a possible consequence of this not being the case, consider the apparent deﬁnite
integral 1
−1(1/x2)dx. If we proceed in a mechanistic way and follow the usual procedure,
we should write
However, if we plot the graph of f(x) = 1/x2, as in Figure 9.1, it is clear that this is not
correct, since it implies that the area under a curve that lies entirely above the x axis is
negative. So where have we gone wrong? The answer lies in the fact that f(x) = 1/x2 has
an inﬁnite discontinuity or singularity (that is, it is unbounded) at x = 0. As a con-
sequence, the region under the curve over the domain of integration [−1, 1] is unbounded,
and our integration process was invalid.
In this section we consider the conditions under which the integral a
b f(x)dx exists
when either
(a) the integrand f(x) becomes unbounded (that is, f(x) has an inﬁnite discontinuity) at
some point within the domain of integration, or
(b) the domain of integration is inﬁnite (that is, either a or b or both are inﬁnite).
Such integrals are called improper integrals, and are encountered in many contexts in
engineering. For example, the period of a simple pendulum of length l released from
rest with angle α is given by
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The integrand is inﬁnite at θ = α; yet we
know that the answer is meaningful from elementary physics. Further examples are met
when Laplace transforms are introduced in Chapter 11.

9.2.1
Integrand with an inﬁnite discontinuity
Suppose that the lower limit x = a is the only point of inﬁnite discontinuity of f(x) in
[a, b]. Then we deﬁne
(9.1)
provided that the one-sided limit exists (see Section 7.8.2). Otherwise a
b f(x)dx has no
meaning.
Similarly, if the upper limit x = b is the only point of inﬁnite discontinuity in [a, b],
we deﬁne
(9.2)
provided that the limit exists. Otherwise a
b f(x)dx has no meaning.

(since X ln X →0 as X →0+, Question 61, Section 7.8.3)
Since the limit exists, it follows from (9.1) that

1
0
ln x dx = −1
(d) In this case the integrand has an inﬁnite discontinuity at the lower limit x = 0, and
we consider the limit
This becomes inﬁnite as X →0 and so the integral has no meaning.
If the integrand f(x) has an inﬁnite discontinuity at x = c, where a  c  b, then we
deﬁne
(9.3)
provided that both limits on the right-hand side exist. Otherwise a
b f(x)dx is not
deﬁned.
Example 9.2
Conﬁrm that 1
−1(1/x2)dx is not deﬁned.
Solution
This is the apparent integral considered in the introductory discussion, where we saw
that following the usual integration techniques in a mechanistic sense led to a ridiculous
answer. In this case the integrand has an inﬁnite discontinuity at x = 0, so, following
(9.3), we consider the two limits
From the solution to Example 9.1(d) it is clear that both these tend to inﬁnity, so that
neither limit exists and the integral 1
−1(1/x2)dx is not deﬁned.

return the answer 1–2π.
(c) The MATLAB commands

return the answer –1.
(d) The MAPLE command

As an exercise consider how MATLAB or MAPLE deals with Example 9.2.
The numerical evaluation of integrals whose integrands have inﬁnite discontinuities will
clearly cause numerical problems. Often such integrals can be evaluated by ﬁrst chang-
ing the integrand by means of a substitution, as illustrated in the following example.
Example 9.3
Obtain the value of the integral
where α = π/3. This is the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum released from rest
from the angle α.
Solution
This integral has an integrand which is unbounded at θ = α. In this case we can ‘remove’
the difﬁculty by the substitution 
. Then

Some theorems with applications to numerical methods
There are a number of theorems involving integration and differentiation that are 
useful in understanding why certain numerical methods are better than others and in
devising new methods. They are also useful in the more mundane tasks of assessing 
the effect of data error when evaluating functions and probing the accuracy of ana-
lytical approximations to functions. We shall now brieﬂy consider such theorems and
indicate their potential uses. Deriving the results is not easy and the reader may prefer
to omit the proofs. The results, however, have many practical implications and should
be studied carefully.
9.3.1
Rolle’s theorem and the ﬁrst mean value theorems
The simplest result is the following
Theorem 9.1
Rolle’s theorem
If the function f(x) is continuous on the domain [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) with
f(a) = f(b) then there is at least one point x = c in (a, b) such that f ′(c) = 0.
end of theorem
The validity of this theorem can be easily illustrated geometrically, as shown in 
Figure 9.2, since what the theorem tells us is that it is possible to ﬁnd at least one point
on the curve y = f(x) between the values x = a and x = b where the tangent is parallel to the
x axis; that is, there must exist at least one maximum or minimum between x = a and x = b.
In Section 7.9.1 we discussed the properties of continuous functions. All continuous
functions are integrable, and this fact enables us to calculate the mean value of a con-
tinuous function over a given domain, say [a, b]. The mean value is given by

Clearly the mean value of f (x) lies between its maximum and minimum values on the
domain [a, b] and, from the intermediate value theorem (Property (c), Section 7.9.1),
we deduce that there is a point x = c in the interval [a, b] such that (see 8.43)
f(c) = mean value of f(x) =
This result is referred to as the ﬁrst mean value theorem of integral calculus and may
be stated as follows.

If the function f(x) is continuous over the domain [a, b] then there exists at least one
point x = c, with a  c  b, such that

This theorem is illustrated geometrically in Figure 9.3(a).

(b) the chord PQ is

at x = ci.

Theorem 9.3
First mean value theorem of differential calculus
If the function f(x) is continuous on the domain [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) then
there exists at least one point x = c, with a  c  b, such that
end of theorem
It is this theorem that is normally referred to as the ﬁrst mean value theorem. Geo-
metrically, it implies that at some point on the interval [a, b] the slope of the tangent to
the graph of f(x) is parallel to the chord between the end points x = a and x = b of the
graph, as shown in Figure 9.2(b).
An immediate application of Theorem 9.3 is in the estimation of the effect of
rounding errors in the independent variable x on the calculated value of the dependent
variable y = f(x). If εx is the error bound for x then the error bound for y is εy, where
Applying the ﬁrst mean value theorem with a = x, b = x* gives
| f(x*) −f(x)| = | x* −x | | f ′(c)|
with c lying between x and x*. Since x −εx < x* < c, f ′(c)  f ′(x), we have
(9.5)
We illustrate this by Example 9.5.
Example 9.5
Show that
∆(sinx)  cos x ∆x
and hence estimate an error bound for sin a, where a = 1.935 (3dp). Compare the error
interval obtained with [sin1.9355, sin1.9345]. Express sin a as a correctly rounded
number with the maximum number of decimal places.
Solution
The difference ∆(sinx) is given by
∆(sinx) = sin(x + ∆x) −sin x
Since (d/dx)sinx = cos x, application of Theorem 9.3 gives
with x  X  x + ∆x
which reduces to
∆(sinx) = cos X∆x,
with x  X  x + ∆x
If ∆x is small then x  X and cos X  cos x, so that
∆(sinx)  cos x ∆x
as required.

Setting x = a gives ∆(sina)  cos a ∆a, and hence, using (9.5), an error bound 
estimate for sina is
εsin a = | cos a |εa
In this example a = 1.935 and εa = 0.0005, so that
εsin a = | cos 1.935 | (0.0005) = |−0.3562 | (0.0005) = 0.000 18
Thus
sin a = sin 1.935 ± 0.000 18 = 0.934 41 ± 0.000 18
which spans the interval [0.93423, 0.93459].
Now sin1.9355 = 0.93423 and sin1.9345 = 0.93459, so that in this example the
estimate of the error interval and the error interval are the same to 5dp.
Thus
sin a = 0.9344 ± 0.0002
or
sin a = 0.93
9.3.2
Convergence of iterative schemes
In Section 7.9.3 the solution of equations by iteration was discussed. We now consider
the convergence of such iterative schemes. As before, suppose that an iteration for the
root x = α of the equation f(x) = 0 is given by
xn+1 = g(xn)
(n = 0, 1, 2, … )
where α = g(α). When we use such an iteration we need a rule which tells us when
to stop the process. The usual practice is to stop the iteration when the difference
| xn+1 −xn | between two successive iterates is sufﬁciently small, that is, when it is less
than half-a-unit of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure required in the answer.
There are two separate issues here: one concerns the convergence of the iteration
formula to the root, and the other concerns the ‘stopping’ mechanism. In practical
computation, the rule of stopping an iteration is important because it vitally affects the
accuracy of the estimate of the root of the equation.
Convergence process
To examine the convergence of the iteration to the root α, we estimate |xn+1 −α| as
n →∞. Now
xn+1 = g(xn)
and
α = g(α)
so that
xn+1 −α = g(xn) −g(α)
Using the mean value Theorem 9.3, this may be written as
xn+1 −α = (xn −α)g′(Xn)

where Xn lies in the interval (xn, α), assuming xn  α. Writing εn = xn −α, we obtain
| εn+1 |  r |εn |
where r = |g′(x)|max in the neighbourhood of x = α. By comparison with the geometric
sequence, we deduce that εn →0, as n →∞, if 0  r  1 and that, provided we start
near x = α, the iteration converges if |g′(x)|  1 near x = α. Note that the more 
horizontal the graph of g(x) near the root, the smaller r is and hence the more rapid is
the convergence. We will discuss this further in Section 9.4.7.
Stopping process
The ‘stopping’ rule can be investigated similarly. The rule says that the iteration is
stopped when | xn+1 −xn |  ε, where ε is the maximum acceptable error. We therefore
seek a relationship between |xn+1 −α| and | xn+1 −xn |.
Now we can rewrite xn+1 −α as
xn+1 −α = (xn+1 −xn+2) + (xn+2 −xn+3) + (xn+3 −xn+4) + … + (xn+k −α)
Since xn →α as n →∞, it follows that xn+k →α as k →∞, since all the previous terms
on the right-hand side tend to zero. The terms on the right-hand side can be thought of
as the corrections made to successive iterates in the process. We may therefore write
(9.6)
Using the ﬁrst mean value Theorem 9.3, we have
xn+1 −xn+2 = g(xn) −g(xn+1)
= (xn −xn+1)g′(Xn)
where Xn lies in the interval (xn, xn+1), assuming xn  xn+1. By repeated application of
this result, we have
xn+2 −xn+3 = (xn+1 −xn+2)g′(Xn+1) = (xn −xn+1)g′(Xn)g′(Xn+1)

leading to
xn+k −xn+k+1 = (xn −xn+1)g′(Xn)g′(Xn+1) … g′(Xn+k−1)
(9.7)
If, as before, |g′(x)|  r  1 in the neighbourhood of x = α then we obtain from (9.6)

using the expression for the sum of a geometric progression given in (7.14). Hence
Thus | xn+1 −α|  ε provided that r 
, and the ‘stopping’ rule is valid provided that 
| g′(x)| 
near the root x = α. In many practical problems it is necessary to estimate
r by
| xn+1 −xn |/| xn −xn−1| = | g(xn) −g(xn−1) |/| xn −xn−1|
Clearly, the smaller the value of r, the more rapid is the convergence. Note, however,
that this discussion has ignored the effects of rounding errors on the computation, so
that the result above has been shown only for exact arithmetic.
Example 9.6
Show that the iteration
θn+1 = tan−1(tanh θn),
with θ0 =
π  3.9
considered in Section 7.9.3 is convergent to the root near θ = 3.9 of the equation 
tanθ = tanhθ (see Figure 9.4).
Solution
Here the iteration function has formula
g(θ) = tan−1(tanh θ)
with derivative
Near θ = 3.9, cosh 2θ  1220, so |g′(θ) | is small (in fact r  0.004) and the method
converges.

Example 9.7
A spherical wooden ball ﬂoats in water, as illustrated in Figure 9.5. Its diameter is 
10cm and its density is 0.8gcm−3. Find the depth h cm to which it sinks.
Solution
Archimedes shouted ‘ευρηκα!’ when he realized that the weight of a ﬂoating body
must balance the weight of water it displaces. In this case we have the weight of the 
ball is
π(5)3 × 0.8 g
The volume of a zone depth h of a sphere of radius r is
πh2(3r −h) (see Example 8.63)
so the weight of water displaced is
πh2(15 −h)g
Hence by Archimedes’ principle we have
π × 125 ×
=
πh2(15 −h)
that is
400 = h2(15 −h)
Graphing y = (x −15)x2 + 400 shows that there is a root near x = 7. To ﬁnd the root
more accurately we can construct an iteration. For example
hn+1 = [(h3
n + 400)/15]1/2
Starting with h0 = 7.00, we obtain the iterates given in the table below.

With this set of iterates we would be tempted to conclude that the root is 7.11 or 7.12.
In fact the correct answer is 7.13. This example shows the importance of the size of 
the derivative of the iteration function. In this case it is 0.7 near the root and there is
danger of premature termination of the process. Clearly it is not of vital importance 
here but the example illustrates the danger of using an iteration without due care.

Taylor’s theorem and related results
A question that frequently arises in both engineering and mathematical problem-
solving is the behaviour of a solution when one (or more) of the parameters in the 
problem statement is changed. This occurs in sensitivity analysis when we examine
solutions for their dependence on errors in the original data. It is also relevant to
analysing the equilibrium of structures. One of the mathematical tools for such analyses
is Taylor’s theorem. In this section we shall develop the theorem and then use it to solve
problems in design and numerical methods.
9.4.1
Taylor polynomials and Taylor’s theorem
In Section 2.9.1 we discussed the use of interpolating functions to approximate func-
tions speciﬁed by a table of values. The simplest case was linear interpolation. With
this, we require a different formula between successive tabular points. Another approach
to the problem of function approximation is to construct a polynomial that, together

with its derivatives, takes the same values as those of the function and its derivatives at
a particular point in the domain. That is, we seek a polynomial p(x) such that
p(a) = f(a),
p′(a) = f ′(a),
p″(a) = f ″(a), … 
The idea is illustrated by Example 9.8.
Example 9.8
Find a polynomial approximation to the function f(x) such that
f(0) = 3,
f ′(0) = 4,
f ″(0) = −10
and
f ′″(0) = 12
Solution
In this example we have information about the value of the function and its ﬁrst three
derivatives at x = 0. This means that we can form an approximating polynomial of
degree 3
p(x) = a + bx + cx2 + dx3
and determine the values of a, b, c and d from the information given.
Setting p(0) = f(0) gives a = 3.
Differentiating gives
p′(x) = b + 2cx + 3dx2
and on setting p′(0) = f ′(0) = 4, we have b = 4.
Differentiating again gives
p″(x) = 2c + 6dx
and on setting p″(0) = f ″(0) = −10, we have c = −5.
Differentiating again gives
p″′(x) = 6d
and on setting p″′(0) = f ′″(0) = 12, we have d = 2.
Thus the approximating polynomial is
p(x) = 3 + 4x −5x2 + 2x3
The technique used in Example 9.8 can be applied at points other than x = 0, as shown
in Example 9.9.
Example 9.9
Find a polynomial approximation to f(x) such that
f(1) = 4,
f ′(1) = 0,
f ″(1) = 2
and
f ″′(1) = 12
Solution
Because the information concerns the value of the function and its derivatives at the
point x = 1, we look for a polynomial in powers of x −1. So in this case we are seeking
an approximation in the form
p(x) = a + b(x −1) + c(x −1)2 + d(x −1)3
716

9.4 TAYLOR’S THEOREM AND RELATED RESULTS
717
Setting x = 1 in p(x) and its derivatives gives, in turn,
p(1) = a = 4
p′(1) = b = 0
p″(1) = 2c = 2
p″′(1) = 6d = 12
Thus the required approximation is
p(x) = 4 + 0(x −1) + 1(x −1)2 + 2(x −1)3 = 4 + (x −1)2 + 2(x −1)3
Such polynomial approximations to functions are called Taylor polynomials. In gen-
eral, we can write the nth-degree Taylor polynomial approximation to the function f(x),
given the value of the function and its derivatives at x = a, in the form
f(x)  pn(x)
where
(9.8)
Clearly, pn(a) = f(a), and also the ﬁrst n derivatives of pn(x) match the ﬁrst n derivatives
of f(x) at x = a.
The approximation of f(x) given in (9.8) can be made exact by writing
f(x) = pn(x) + Rn(x)
(9.9)
where Rn(x) is the remainder. The remainder term can be expressed in many different
forms, with the simplest, known as Lagrange’s form, being
where h = x −a and 0  θ  1.
The result (9.9) constitutes Taylor’s theorem, which may be stated as follows.
Theorem 9.4
Taylor’s theorem
If f(x), f ′(x), … , f (n)(x) exist and are continuous on the closed domain [a, x] and f (n+1)(x)
exists on the open domain (a, x) then there exists a number θ, with 0  θ  1, such

Taylor’s theorem is in fact a natural extension of the ﬁrst mean value theorem
(Theorem 9.3), and it is sometimes referred to as the nth mean value theorem. It may
be proved by repeated use of Rolle’s theorem (Theorem 9.1), but, since the proof does
not add to our understanding of how to apply the result to the solution of engineering
problems, it is not developed here.
9.4.2
Taylor and Maclaurin series
An alternative form of the Taylor polynomial (9.10) is obtained when we replace x in
the expansion by a + x. Then we obtain a polynomial in x, rather than x −a, namely
(9.11)
where
with 0  θ  1
Equation (9.11) is called the Taylor polynomial expansion of f(x) about x = a.
The remainder Rn(x) represents the error involved in approximating f(x) by the
polynomial
If Rn(x) →0 as n →∞then we may represent f(x) by the power series
(9.12)
The power series (9.12) is called the Taylor series expansion of f(x) about x = a. We
saw in Section 7.7.1 that a power series may have a restricted domain of convergence.
Similarly, Rn(x) may tend to zero as n →∞only for a restricted interval of values of x
or not at all. In that case the power series given by (9.12) will only represent the
function f(x) in that interval of convergence.
Setting a = 0 in (9.13) leads to the special case
(9.13)
which is known as the Maclaurin series expansion of f(x).

Example 9.10
Find the Maclaurin series expansion of exsin x.
Solution
Since f(x) = exsin x,
f ′(x) = ex(sin x + cos x)
This may be rewritten (see Section 2.6.5) as
f ′(x) = ÷2exsin(x +
π)
so the process of differentiation is equivalent to multiplying by ÷2 and adding π to the
argument of the sine function. Thus we can write the second derivative directly as
f ″(x) = (÷2)2exsin(x + 2 ×
π) = 2excos x
and so on for higher derivatives, giving in general
f (k)(x) = (÷2)kexsin(x +
kπ)
Putting x = 0 gives f(0) = 0, f (1)(0) = 1, f (2)(0) = 2, f (3)(0) = 2, f (4)(0) = 0, f (5)(0) = −4,
f (6)(0) = −8, … , which, on substituting into (9.13), gives
It remains to show that Rn(x) →0 as n →∞. Since
with 0  θ  1
we have in this particular example
with 0  θ  1
We recall that the series for ex is convergent for all x, so that xn/n! →0 as n →∞. Hence
(x÷2)n+1/(n + 1)! →0 as n →∞, and | sin[θx +
(n + 1)π] |  1, and so
Rn(x) →0
as n →∞
for all x
Thus the Maclaurin expansion of exsin x is
In practice it is rarely the case that we obtain the Maclaurin series expansion of a 
function by direct calculation of the derivatives as in Example 9.10. More commonly,
we obtain such series by the manipulation of known standard Maclaurin series as 
we did in Section 7.7.2. Most of the standard series were given in Figure 7.13. For 
convenience, we reproduce some of them in Figure 9.6.

In MATLAB the command taylor(f,n,x,a) returns (n −1)th order Taylor series
expansion of f(x) about x = a, while the command taylor(f,n,x) returns the
Maclaurin series expansion of f(x). The corresponding command in MAPLE is 
taylor(f,x = a,n); (Note that in this case we need to specify x = 0 or x = a or
similar and if n is not speciﬁed then 6 is the default value). Considering Example
9.10 the commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
syms x
f = taylor(exp(x)*sin(x),
taylor(exp(x)*sin(x),
6,x);
x = 0);

return the answers

x + x 2 + 1–3x 3 -

which check with the answer given in the solution.
To obtain the ﬁrst three terms of the corresponding series about x = a the 
commands
syms x a
f = taylor(exp(x)*sin(x),
taylor(exp(x)*sin(x),
3,x,a);
x = a,3);
return the answer

Notice that in Example 9.12 we have integrated a power series to obtain the expansion
of another function. In general, we may integrate and differentiate power series within
their domains of absolute convergence.
For Example 9.12 check that the commands

taylor((1 – x^2)^(–1/2),
taylor((1 – x^2)^(–1/2),

int(ans);
int(%,x);
pretty(ans)
return the integrated series for sin−1x.
Note: In both cases the square root term could be entered as 1/sqrt(1 – x^2) and
this is often preferred.

L’Hôpital’s rule
Sometimes we need to ﬁnd limits of the form
where f(a) = g(a) = 0. Even though such a limit may be deﬁned, it cannot be found 
by substituting x = a, since this produces the indeterminate form 0/0. Using Taylor’s
theorem (Theorem 9.4), we can formulate a rule for obtaining such limits if they exist.
Using Taylor’s series, we may write
since f(a) = g(a) = 0, x ≠a
Hence
provided g′(a) ≠0. This is known as L’Hôpital’s rule.
It may be that f′(a)/g′(a) is also indeterminate. Consequently, when applying
L’Hôpital’s rule to obtain the limit
we must repeat the process of differentiating f(x) and g(x) each time we have the
indeterminate form 0/0 at x = c. If, however, at any stage in the process, one or other of
the derivatives is non-zero at x = a then we must stop the process, since the rule will
no longer apply. In such cases the limit is either zero or inﬁnite or does not exist; for
example, 
does not exist.

Example 9.14
Using L’Hôpital’s rule, obtain the limits
(a)
(b)
Solution
(a) Since (sin x −x)/x3 takes the indeterminate form 0/0 at x = 0, we apply L’Hôpital’s
rule to give
(again 0/0 at x = 0)
(again 0/0 at x = 0)
so that
(b) Since (1 −cosx)/(x + x2) takes the form 0/0 at x = 0, we apply L’Hôpital’s rule to give
Note that in this case the limit is zero since (sin x)/(1 + 2x) takes the form 0/1 at x = 0.
If we mistakenly proceeded to apply the rule once again, we should obtain
an incorrect answer, since the rule was not applicable. The reader may have noticed that
both of these limits can be readily evaluated using Maclaurin series.

gave a value for f(x) which was as accurate as the original data when |∆2fi| is less than
4 units of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure. In many applications, it is easier to express this
condition in terms of the second derivative rather than the second difference.
Now
∆2fi = f(xi + h) −2f(xi) + f(xi −h)
Replacing f(xi + h) and f(xi −h) by their Taylor expansions about x = xi, we have (after
some cancelling of terms)
∆2fi = h2f ″(xi) +
f ″″(xi) + …
The leading term provides a good estimate for ∆2fi so that the condition for accurate 
linear interpolation becomes
h2 | f ″(x)|  4 units of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure
This enables us to choose an appropriate tabular interval, as is shown in Example 9.15.
Example 9.15
The function f(x) = e−x is to be tabulated to 4dp on the interval [0, 0.5]. Find the
maximum tabular interval such that the resulting table is suitable for linear interpolation
to 4dp, that is, to yield an interpolated value which is as accurate as the tabulated value.
Solution
Here we require that
h2 | f ″(x)|  4 × 0.0001
Since f(x) = e−x we deduce that f ″(x) = e−x. On the interval [0, 0.5], the maximum value
of e−x occurs at x = 0, where e0 = 1. Thus we need the largest value of h such that
h2  4 × 0.0001
Hence h  0.02, so that the largest tabular interval is 0.02.

The convergence of iterations revisited
In Section 9.4.2 we analysed the convergence of an iteration xn+1 = g(xn) for the root α
of an equation f(x) = 0. We can use the Taylor expansion to analyse the rate of con-
vergence of such schemes. Setting xn = α + εn, so that εn is the error after n iterations,
we have
α + εn+1 = g(α + εn)
Expanding g(α + εn) about x = α, using the Taylor series (9.12), gives
(9.15)
Since α is a root of the equation f(x) = 0, we have α = g(α) and (9.15) simpliﬁes to
(9.16)
If g′(α) ≠0 then εn+1 is proportional to εn, and we have a ﬁrst-order process. If g′(α) = 0
and g″(α) ≠0 then εn+1 is proportional to εn
2, and we have a second-order process, and
so on.
Example 9.16
The equation x tan x = 4 has an inﬁnite number of roots. To ﬁnd the root near x = 1, we
may use the iteration
Show that this is a ﬁrst-order process. Starting with x0 = 1, ﬁnd x3 and assess its 
accuracy.
Solution
Here g(x) = tan−1(4/x), so that
which is non-zero for all x, i.e. g′(α) ≠0. Thus the iteration is a ﬁrst-order process.
Starting with x0 = 1, we obtain, working to 4dp, the following table.

Newton–Raphson procedure
One of the most popular techniques used by engineers for solving non-linear equations
is the Newton–Raphson procedure. The basic idea is that if x0 is an approximation
to the root x = α of the equation f(x) = 0 then a closer approximation will be given by
the point x = x1 where the tangent to the graph at x = x0 cuts the x axis, as shown in
Figure 9.7.
From the deﬁnition of the derivative
which can be rearranged to give
Taking x1 as the new approximation to the root x = α and repeating the procedure, as
illustrated in Figure 9.7, we obtain the closer aproximation
and so on. In general, we may write
(9.17)
Equation (9.7) is known as the Newton–Raphson iteration procedure for obtaining an
approximation to the root of f(x) = 0. Note that if f ′(xn) = 0 then (9.7) cannot be used

to obtain xn+1. This is because the tangent to the graph of y = f(x) at x = xn will be
parallel to the horizontal x axis.
Comparing with the general iteration xn+1 = g(xn), we see that in the case of the
Newton–Raphson procedure (9.19) the iteration function is
which, using the quotient rule, has derivative
Since α is a root of f(x) = 0, we have f(α) = 0, giving
g′(α) = 0
so the procedure is not a ﬁrst-order process. Differentiating again and substituting x = α,
we obtain
and we have a second-order process provided that f ′(α) ≠0. If f ″(α) = 0, f ′(α) ≠0 then
we have a third- or higher-order process. When f(x) = 0 has a repeated root at x = α,
g′(α) has the indeterminate form 0/0, and the analysis fails. Repeated roots cause
numerical as well as theoretical problems.
Example 9.17
The equation xtan x = 4 was considered earlier in Example 9.16. Apply the Newton–
Raphson method to ﬁnd the root near x = 1.
Solution
First, we rewrite the equation in the more convenient (for differentiation) form
x sin x −4 cos x = 0
Then taking f(x) = x sin x −4 cos x we have f ′(x) = x cos x + 5 sin x. Using the iteration
xn+1 = xn −f(xn)/f ′(xn),
x0 = 1
gives the values (to 9dp)

1.264 600 951
1.264 591 571
1.264 591 571
so that after four iterations we obtain an answer correct to 9dp.

Iteration for the root 
of the equation
8.0000x4 + 0.4500x3 −
4.5440x −0.1136 = 0.
Solution
In this particular example
f(x) = 8.0000x4 + 0.4500x3 −4.5440x −0.1136
giving
f ′(x) = 32.0000x3 + 1.3500x2 −4.5440
When iterating for the root using the Newton–Raphson procedure (9.17), it is usual 
to present the calculations in tabular form, as shown in Figure 9.8 for this particular
example. To 4sf the root is given by x = 0.8182. When using the Newton–Raphson
method, it is recommended that the iteration formula is not tidied up into a single
expression but is left in the ‘approximation minus error’ format. Tidying up may lead to
ill-conditioning of the numerical procedure.
There are no built-in programs for Newton–Raphson in either MATLAB or MAPLE.
The method is basically a numerical procedure, so MATLAB seems to be the 
obvious package to use. You will need to develop a little program, as illustrated
below for Example 9.18.
% Set up initial data and put initial results into R
e = 0.0001; acc = 1; x = .8; f = 8*x^4 + .45*x^3 -
4.544*x - 0.1136; fd = 32*x^3 + 1.35*x^2 - 4.544;
R = [x;f;fd];
% Now iterate until acc is less than e and add results
to R
while acc>e xold = x;
x = x - f/fd; f = 8*x^4 + .45*x^3 - 4.544*x - 0.1136; 
fd = 32*x^3 + 1.35*x^2 - 4.5440;
R = [R [x;f;fd]];
acc = abs(x - xold);
end
R
which returns
R =

9.4 TAYLOR’S THEOREM AND RELATED RESULTS

9.4.9
Optimization revisited
In Section 8.5 we indicated that we would return to reconsider the conditions for deter-
mining the nature of stationary points following the introduction of the Taylor series.
If a minimum value of a differentiable function f(x) occurs at x = a then the difference
f(a + h) −f(a) will be positive for all small h. However, from the Taylor series (9.12)
and the sign of the expression on the right-hand side depends on the sign of h. It will
change sign as h changes sign unless f ′(a) = 0, in which case the sign depends on 
the sign of f ″(a). Thus a necessary condition for the minimum to occur at x = a is that
f ′(a) = 0, and a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a minimum of f(x) at x = a
is f ′(a) = 0 and f ″(a)  0. Similarly, the maxima of differentiable functions occur when
f ′(a) = 0 and f ″(a)  0. If f ′(a) = 0 and f ″(a) = 0, we may have a maximum or minimum
value or a point of inﬂection. If f ′(a) = f ″(a) = 0, a necessary condition for a minimum
or maximum at x = a is f ″′(a) = 0, and so on. However, it is important to remember that
a function may have an optimal value at a point where its derivative does not exist, as
illustrated in Figure 9.9. A numerical scheme for locating the optimal point of a func-
tion using the Newton–Raphson procedure can be established. The resulting iteration
is, however, rarely used in practice. Generally, bracketing methods are used similar to
that described in Question 85 (Exercises 8.5.2).

Subdividing the interval [a, b] into n equal strips of width h, we have
Applying the Euler–Maclaurin formula to each term in the summation, we obtain the
trapezium rule together with a power series expansion of the truncation error in terms
of h:
= T(h) + α1h2 + α2h4 + α3h6 + …
(9.18)
where T(h) is the trapezium approximation to the integral using n strips of width h with
nh = b −a, and the α’s are independent of h. From this we see that the principal term
of the global truncation error for the approximation is 
h2[ f ′(b) −f ′(a)] which, using
the ﬁrst mean value Theorem 9.3, may be written 
h2(b −a)f ″(c) where a  c  b.
This analysis makes no allowance for the effect of rounding errors in the values of
fi (i = 0, 1, … , n). A simple estimate of these is
= nh(
unit of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure)
= (b −a)(
unit of the least signiﬁcant ﬁgure)
This result assumes a ﬁxed number of decimal places in the values of the integrand, and
is suitable for calculator work. For computers, when h is small and n large, there is the pro-
blem of loss of signiﬁcant digits when adding a large number of almost-equal numbers.
Example 9.19
In Example 8.68 the integral 2
1(1/x)dx was estimated using the trapezium rule with h =
and tabulating the integrand to 6dp. Estimate an error bound for the answer obtained.
Solution
Here f(x) = 1/x, a = 1 and b = 2. The global error is given by
(b −a)h2f ″(X),
with a  X  b
so that in this example it is
The largest possible value this can take is when X = 1, so we obtain an estimate for 
the truncation error of 0.010. The rounding-error effect, 0.0000005, is negligible 
compared with this. The error bound we have now calculated safely overestimates the
actual error 0.004 obtained in the calculation.

9.4 TAYLOR’S THEOREM AND RELATED RESULTS
733
Returning to the full Euler–Maclaurin expansion (9.18), using 2n strips of width h, 
we obtain
(9.19)
Eliminating the α1 terms from (9.18) and (9.19) (by subtracting the former from 4 × the
latter, and dividing the result by 3) gives
Thus the estimate [4T( h) −T(h)] is more accurate than either T( h) or T(h) taken
separately. This implies that the truncation error for Simpson’s rule is proportional
to h4, which explains why it is a good method for hand computation (as opposed to
automatic computation).

Calculus of vectors
In mechanics the vectors describing a dynamic system are time-dependent. Such vectors
may be integrated and differentiated in a natural extension of the same processes for
scalar quantities. In this section we brieﬂy introduce the relevant deﬁnitions.
9.5.1
Differentiation and integration of vectors
The formal deﬁnition gives the derivative of a vector ν(t) as
so if ν = (v1(t), v2(t), v3(t)) then
For example, the position vector r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) of a particle may be differentiated
with respect to time t to give its velocity ν(t) as
Differentiating again gives the acceleration of the particle as
When differentiating a vector with respect to time, it is conventional to use a ‘dot’ 
notation and write
The usual rules of differentiation may be deduced from this deﬁnition.

Figure 9.10

Solution
This is the equation of motion of a projectile under gravity. Integrating the equation
once gives
Since U(0) = V, we have
c = V
and
Integrating a second time gives
r(t) = Vt −
gt2k + a
Since r(0) = 0, we have a = 0, giving
r = Vt −
gt2k
Now r = (x, y, z), so that when V = (u, 0, v), we have
(x, y, z) = (u, 0, v)t + (0, 0, −gt2)
= (ut, 0, vt) + (0, 0, −gt2)
= (ut, 0, vt −
gt2)
Thus
x = ut,
y = 0
and
z = vt −
gt2
Substituting t = x/u into the equation for z gives, after some rearrangement,
This is a parabola with vertex at (uv/g, 0, v2/2g).

Functions of several variables
In many applications we use functions of several independent variables, for example,
the velocity of a ﬂuid at a point depends on its space coordinates, the temperature in a
heat furnace depends upon its position and so on. The basic ideas of calculus apply to
functions of several variables as well as to functions of one variable. Of course, because
more variables are involved, the notation and technical detail are more complicated but
the essential ideas are the same. In the remainder of this chapter we will explore the
extension of the process and ideas of differentiation to functions of several independent
variables. As we shall see below, the rate of change of the function with respect to its
variables can be expressed in terms of the rates of change of the function with respect
to each of the independent variables separately.
9.6.1
Representation of functions of two variables
For functions of two independent variables, we are able to extend the ideas of a func-
tion of one variable. We use three coordinate axes, conventionally setting x and y as the
independent variables and z = f(x, y) as the dependent variable. Instead of a function
being represented by a curve in two dimensions, now a function is represented by a 
surface in three dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 9.12(a) for the function f(x, y) =
3x −x3 −y2. Often it is easier to understand the behaviour of a function by sketching 
its contours (or level curves), that is, the curves deﬁned by f(x, y) = c for various 
values of the constant c, as shown in Figure 9.12(b) for the same function. Such plots
are readily produced using MATLAB or MAPLE.
Figure 9.11

Using the Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB the commands
syms x y
ezsurf(f(x,y))
where f(x, y) is a symbolic expression expressed in terms of x and y, plot the surface
z = f(x, y) over the default domain −2π  x  2π, −2π  y  2π, with the computa-
tional grid being chosen according to the amount of variation that occurs. If we wish
to specify the domain then we use the command
ezsurf (f(x,y),domain)
where the domain is speciﬁed as either the 4-array [a, b, c, d], with a  x  b, c 
y  b, or the 2-array [a, b] with a  x  b, a  y  b.

In MAPLE the surface f(x, y), a  x  b, c  y  b is obtained using the 
command
plot3d(f(x,y), x = a..b, y = c..d);
where f(x, y) is expressed in terms of x and y.
Likewise, in MATLAB the commands
syms x y
ezcontour(f(x,y))
plot the contour of f(x, y) over the default domain −2π  x  2π, −2π  y  2π. 
The domain may be speciﬁed using the command
ezcontour(f(x,y), domain)
where the domain may be the 4-array or 2-array speciﬁed above for ezsurf. The
corresponding commands in MAPLE are
with(plots):
contourplot(f(x,y), x = a..b, y = c..d);
9.6.2
Partial derivatives
Given a function of one variable, f(x), we recall from Section 8.2.2 that the derivative
was deﬁned by
and that this was a measure of the rate of change of the value of the function f(x) with
respect to its variable (or argument) x. For a function of several variables it is also 
useful to know how the function changes when one, some or all of the variables change.
To achieve this we deﬁne the partial derivatives of a function.
First, we consider a function f(x, y) of the two variables x and y. The partial derivative
, of f(x, y) with respect to x is its derivative with respect to x treating the value of y
as being constant. Thus
Likewise, the partial derivative, 
, of f(x, y) with respect to y is its derivative with
respect to y treating the value of x as being constant, so that
The process of obtaining the partial derivatives is called partial differentiation.
Note the use of ‘curly dees’, which is to distinguish between partial differentiation and

, all of which have different meanings.
A concise notation is sometimes used for partial derivatives; as an alternative to the
‘curly dee’, we write
It should be noted, however, that subscripts often have other connotations, so care
should be taken in using them in this way.
If we write z = f(x, y) then the partial derivatives may also be written as
Summary
The partial derivatives of the function z = f(x, y) with respect to the variables x and
y respectively are given by

Finding partial derivatives is no more difﬁcult than ﬁnding derivatives of functions of
one variable, with the constant multiplication, sum, product and quotient rules having
counterparts for partial derivatives. Note, however, that, despite the notation, partial 
derivatives do not behave like fractions. For example, 
.

9.6 FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

Although we have introduced partial derivatives in the context of functions of two
variables, the concept may be readily extended to obtain the partial derivatives of a
function of as many variables as we please. Thus for a function f(x1, x2, … , xn) of 
n variables the partial derivative with respect to xi is given by
and is obtained by differentiating the function with respect to xi with all the other
n −1 variables kept constant.
Example 9.26
Find the partial derivatives of
f(x, y, z) = xyz2 + 3xy −z
with respect to x, y and z.
Solution
Differentiating f(x, y, z) with respect to x, keeping y and z ﬁxed, gives
Differentiating f(x, y, z) with respect to y, keeping x and z ﬁxed, gives
Differentiating f(x, y, z) with respect to z, keeping x and y ﬁxed, gives
= xy(2z) + 0 −1 = 2xyz −1
The partial derivatives fx and fy of the function f(x, y), with respect to x and y
respectively, are given by the commands
MATLAB
MAPLE
syms x y
f = f(x,y)
f:= f(x,y);
fx = diff(f,x)
fx:= diff(f,x);
fy = diff(f,y)

fz = diff(fz); pretty(fz) return the answer 2xyz - 1
For practice, check the answers to Examples 9.24(a) and 9.25(a) and (b).
9.6.3
Directional derivatives
Consider a function of two variables z = f(x, y). This may be represented as a surface
in three dimensions, as shown in Figure 9.13.
We recall from Chapter 8 that the derivative of a function f(x) of one variable meas-
ures the slope of the tangent to the graph of the function, as illustrated in Figure 9.14.
In the case of a function of two variables, because z = f(x, y) deﬁnes a surface in three
dimensions, there is no unique meaning of ‘slope’ unless we specify the direction in
which it is to be measured. In general, the slope will be different for different directions.
Now consider two points P and Q on the surface z = f(x, y), as shown in Figure 9.15
and let P′ and Q′ be their projections on the x–y plane. To simplify, set P′Q′ = l; then
the coordinates of P′ and Q′ are given by
(x, y, 0)
and
(x + l cosα, y + l sinα, 0)

respectively, where α is the angle that P′Q′ makes with the positive x direction. The
slope of the line PQ is then
and the slope of the surface at P in the direction of p1q2 is the limit of this quotient as 
l →0. Denoting this slope by mα(x, y), we have
Here the subscript α indicates the direction with respect to which the slope is measured,
and the (x, y) shows the point at which it is evaluated. Essentially, we have reduced
the problem of a function of two variables to a function of one variable by ﬁxing
the direction along which we allow x and y to vary. It would be very clumsy to have to
perform the calculation this way every time we wish to work out the rate of change
or slope of the function. To simplify the process, we shall show how to represent the
slope mα in terms of two standard slopes: one in the x direction and the other in the
y direction.
To do this, we rearrange the numerator of the quotient as a sum of terms, one show-
ing the change in f(x, y) due to the change l cos α in x, the other showing the change in
f(x, y) due to the change l sinα in y. Thus
f(x + l cosα, y + l sinα) −f(x, y) = [ f(x + l cosα, y + l sinα) −f(x, y + l sinα)]
+ [ f(x, y + l sinα) −f(x,y)]

FURTHER CALCULUS
Examining the numerator of p(x, y), we see that the ‘y value’ in both terms is the
same, y + l sin α, and also that l sin α →0 as l →0. In contrast, the ‘x value’ in the terms
differs by l cosα. Denoting this by ∆x we may write
which simpiﬁes to
(9.22)
In the same way,
(9.23)
and we may then write the slope in the direction at an angle α to the x axis as
(9.24)
Example 9.27
Find the partial derivatives of f(x, y) = x2y3 + 3y + x with respect to x and y, and the
slope of the function in the direction at an angle α to the x axis.
Solution
To ﬁnd the partial derivative of f(x, y) with respect to x, we differentiate f(x, y) with
respect to x, keeping y constant. Thus
Similarly, we obtain the partial derivative with respect to y by differentiating f(x, y)
with respect to y, keeping x constant. Thus
The general expression for the slope of the surface z = f(x, y) in the direction at an
angle α to the x axis is
So for this function we have
mα(x, y) = (2xy3 + 1)cosα + (3x2y2 + 3)sinα
Since in evaluating ∂f/∂x we consider only the variation of f(x, y) in the x direction,
∂f/∂x gives the slope of the surface z = f(x, y) at the point (x, y) in the x direction
(α = 0 in (9.24)). Similarly, ∂f/∂y gives the slope in the y direction (α =
π in (9.24)).
This is illustrated in Figure 9.16.

Thus if we know ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y, we can calculate the slope mα(x, y) of the func-
tion in any given direction using (9.24). This is called the directional derivative of 
f(x, y), and may be regarded as the projection of the vector (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y) onto the direction
represented by the unit vector (cos α, sin α), so that (cos α, sin α) is a unit vector in the
direction of the required derivative. Thus we may express mα(x, y) as the scalar product

The chain rule
As can be seen from Examples 9.24–9.26, the rules and results of ordinary differenti-
ation carry over to partial differentiation. In particular, the composite-function rule still
holds, but in a modiﬁed form. Consider the two-variable case where z = f(x, y) and x
and y are themselves functions of two independent variables, s and t. Then z itself is
also a function of s and t, say F(s, t), and we can ﬁnd its derivatives using a composite-
function rule that gives the rates of change of z with respect to s and t in terms of the
rates of change of z with respect to x and y and the rates of change of x and y with
respect to s and t. Thus
(9.25)
or, in vector–matrix form,
This result is often called the chain rule. The proof is straightforward. Consider ∂z/∂s,
given by
The point (s + ∆s, t) in the s–t plane will correspond to the point (x + ∆x, y + ∆y) in 
the x–y plane, while (s, t) corresponds to (x, y). Thus
We can similarly prove the result for ∂z/∂t.

It may happen, of course, that x and y are functions of one variable only or of three
variables or more. In all these cases the chain rule still applies when the functions
involved are differentiable.
Example 9.28
Find ∂T/∂r and ∂T/∂θ when

so that
= (3x2 −y)cosθ + (−x + 3y2)sin θ
Substituting for x and y in terms of r and θ gives

Similarly,
= (3x2 −y)(−rsinθ) + (−x + 3y2)r cosθ
= 3r3(sinθ −cosθ)cos θsinθ + r2(sin2θ −cos2θ)

Solution
We note that x and y are functions of t only, so that the chain rule (9.5) becomes
Note the mixture of partial and ordinary derivatives. H is a function of the one variable
t, but its dependence is expressed through the two variables x and y.
Substituting for the derivatives involved, we have
= 3[cos(3x −y)]4t −[cos(3x −y)](t −5)
= (11t + 5)cos(3x −y)
= (11t + 5)cos(

Solution
The volume V of a cone having base radius r and height h is
V =

We wish to determine dV/dt given dr/dt and dh/dt. Applying the chain rule (9.25)

To substitute for x and y in terms of r and theta we make use of the eval command,
with
eval(Tr); pretty(ans)
returning the answer
(3r 2cos(theta)2 - rsin(theta))cos(theta) + (-rcos(theta)
+ 3r 2sin(theta)2)sin(theta)
which readily reduces to the answer given in the solution.
Similarly the commands
Ttheta = Tx*xtheta + Ty*ytheta;
eval(Ttheta); pretty(ans)
return the answer
(-3r 2cos(theta)2 + rsin(theta))rsin(theta) + (-rcos(theta)

MAPLE solves this problem much more efﬁciently using the commands

diff(T(r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta)), r);
diff(T(r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta)), theta);

and
There are some functions for which the mixed second derivatives are not equal, that is
and the order of differentiation is therefore important, but for most of the functions that
occur in engineering problems, when the second derivatives are usually continuous
functions, these mixed derivatives are the same in value. In a similar manner we can

Note that in this example
In MATLAB and MAPLE, second-order partial derivatives can be obtained by 
suitably differentiating the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives already found. Thus in
MATLAB the second-order partial derivatives of f(x, y) are given by
fxx = diff(fx,x), fxy = diff(fx,y), fyy = diff(fy,y), 
fyx = diff(fy,x)
Alternatively, the non-mixed derivatives can be obtained directly using the
commands
fxx = diff(f,x,2), fyy = diff(f,y,2)
which can be extended to higher-order partial derivatives.
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are
fxx:= diff(f,x,x); fxy:= diff(f,x,y);
fyy:= diff(f,y,y);
Considering Example 9.32 the MATLAB commands
syms x y
f = x^2*y^3 + 3*y + x;
fx = diff(f,x); fy = diff(f,y); fxx = diff(fx,x) return
fxx = 2*y^3
fxy = diff(fx,y) returns fxy = 6*x*y^2

Find all the second partial derivatives of 
f(x, y, z) = (x + 2y)cos3z.
Differentiating fx with respect to x gives
(using the product rule)
Repeated use of the chain rule as indicated above leads to
= 2fs + 2x(2xfss + yfst) + y(2xfts + yftt)
which, on assuming fst = fts, gives
fxx = 2fs + 4x2fss + y2ftt + 4xyfst
(9.26)
Following a similar procedure, we can determine fyy. Differentiating fy with respect to 
y gives
= −2fs −2y(−2yfss + xfst) + x(−2yfts + xftt)
giving
fyy = −2fs + 4y2fss + x2ftt −4xyfst
(9.27)
Adding (9.26) and (9.27), we obtain
fxx + fyy = 4(x2 + y2)fss + (x2 + y2)ftt
= (x2 + y2)(4fss + ftt)
= ÷[(x2 −y2)2 + 4x2y2](4fss + ftt)
which leads to the required result
fxx + fyy = ÷(s2 + 4t2)(4fss + ftt)

The total differential and small errors
Consider a function u = f(x, y) of two variables x and y. Let ∆x and ∆y be increments
in the values of x and y. Then the corresponding increment in u is given by
∆u = f(x + ∆x, y + ∆y) −f(x, y)
We rewrite this as two terms: one showing the change in u due to the change in x, and
the other showing the change in u due to the change in y. Thus
∆u = [ f(x + ∆x, y + ∆y) −f(x, y + ∆y)] + [ f(x, y + ∆y) −f(x, y)]
Dividing the ﬁrst bracketed term by ∆x and the second by ∆y gives

From the deﬁnition of the partial derivative, we may approximate this expression by
We deﬁne the differential du by the equation
(9.28)
By setting f(x, y) = f1(x, y) = x and f(x, y) = f2(x, y) = y in turn in (9.28), we see that
so that for the independent variables, increments and differentials are equal. For the
dependent variable we have
(9.29)
We see that the differential du is an approximation to the change ∆u in u = f(x, y) 
resulting from small changes ∆x and ∆y in the independent variables x and y; that is,

a result illustrated in Figure 9.17.
This extends to functions of as many variables as we please, provided that the
partial derivatives exist. For example, for a function of three variables (x, y, z) deﬁned

Total differential.

9.6 FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
759
The differential of a function of several variables is often called a total differential,
emphasizing that it shows the variation of the function with respect to small changes in
all the independent variables.
Example 9.35
Find the total differential of u(x, y) = x2y3.
Solution
Taking partial derivatives we have
Hence, using (9.29)
du = 2xy3 dx + 3x2y2dy
All physical measurements are subject to error, and a calculated quantity usually
depends on several measurements. It is very important to know the degree of accuracy
that can be relied upon in a quantity that has been calculated. The total differential can
be used to estimate error bounds for quantities calculated from experimental results or
from data that is subject to errors. This is illustrated in Example 9.36.
Example 9.36
The volume V cm3 of a circular cylinder of radius r cm and height h cm is given by 
V = πr2h. If r = 3 ± 0.01 and h = 5 ± 0.005 ﬁnd the greatest possible error in the 
calculation of V and compare it with the estimate obtained using the total differential.
Solution
The total differential is
Then from (9.30)
∆V  dV = 2πrh dr + πr2 dh = πr(2h ∆r + r ∆h)
When r = 3 and h = 5, we are given that ∆r = ±0.01 and ∆h = ±0.005, so that
∆V  ±3π(10 × 0.01 + 3 × 0.005)
giving
∆V  ±0.345π
(It should be noted that ∆r, ∆h, ∆V represent maximum errors.) The calculated volume
V is subject to a maximum positive error of
{(3.01)2(5.005) −45}π = 0.3458π
and a maximum negative error of
{(2.99)2(4.995) −45}π = −0.3442π
Thus the approximation gives a good guide to the accuracy of the result.

The angle of elevation of the top of a tower is
found to be 30° ± 0.5° from a point 300 ± 0.1m

Estimate the height of the tower.
Example 9.37
Two variables, x and y, are related by y = ae−bx, where a and b are constants. The
values of a and b are determined from experimental data and have relative error bounds
p and q respectively. What is the relative error bound for a value of y calculated using
the formula with these values of a and b?
Solution
Note that in this example it is assumed that the value of x is known exactly. We are
given y = ae−bx, where a and b are approximations with errors ∆a and ∆b, which are
unknown but are such that
The formula for the total differential gives
For the independent variables a and b the increments and the differentials are the same
quantity, so that da = ∆a and db = ∆b. Also, from the given formula for y, we have
Thus, from (9.28),
dy = e−bx∆a −xae−bx∆b
and division by y gives
Hence
Since ∆y  dy, we obtain an estimate for the relative error bound for y as p + | bx |q.

Exact differentials
Differentials sometimes arise naturally when modelling practical problems. An example
in ﬂuid dynamics is given in Section 9.9. When this occurs, it is often possible to analyse
the problem further by testing to see if the expression in which the differentials occur
is a total differential. Consider the equation
P(x, y)dx + Q(x, y)dy = 0
connecting x, y and their differentials. The left-hand side of this equation is said to be
an exact differential if there is a function f(x, y) such that
df = P(x, y)dx + Q(x, y)dy
Now we know that
so if f(x, y) exists then
For functions with continuous second derivatives we have

Thus if f(x, y) exists then
(9.31)
This gives us a test for the existence of f(x, y), but does not tell us how to ﬁnd it! The
technique for ﬁnding f(x, y) is shown in Example 9.38.
Example 9.38
Show that
(6x + 9y + 11)dx + (9x −4y + 3)dy
is an exact differential and ﬁnd the relationship between y and x given
and the condition y = 1 when x = 0.
Solution
In this example
P(x, y) = 6x + 9y + 11
and
Q(x, y) = 9x −4y + 3
First we test whether the expression is an exact differential. In this example
so from (9.31) we have an exact differential. Thus we know that there is a function
f(x, y) such that
(9.32), (9.33)
Integrating (9.32) with respect to x, keeping y constant (that is, reversing the partial 
differentiation process), we have
f(x, y) = 3x 2 + 9xy + 11x + g(y)
(9.34)
Note that the ‘constant’ of integration is a function of y. You can check that this expres-
sion for f(x, y) is correct by differentiating it partially with respect to x. But we also
know from (9.33) the partial derivative of f(x, y) with respect to y, and this enables us
to ﬁnd g′(y). Differentiating (9.34) partially with respect to y and equating it to (9.33),
we have

so, on integrating,
g(y) = −2y2 + 3y + C
Substituting back into (9.34) gives
f(x, y) = 3x2 + 9xy + 11x −2y2 + 3y + C
Now we are given that
which implies that
(6x + 9y + 11)dx + (9x −4y + 3)dy = 0
which in turn implies that
3x 2 + 9xy + 11x −2y2 + 3y + A = 0
The arbitrary constant A is ﬁxed by applying the given condition y = 1 when x = 0, 
giving A = −1. Thus x and y satisfy the equation
3x 2 + 9xy + 11x −2y2 + 3y = 1

Taylor’s theorem for functions of two variables
In this section we extend Taylor’s theorem for one variable (Theorem 9.4) to a function
of two variables and apply it to unconstrained and constrained optimization problems.

9.7.1
Taylor’s theorem
First we consider a function of two variables. Suppose f(x, y) is a function all of whose
nth-order partial derivatives exist and are continuous on some circular domain D with
centre (a, b). Then, if (a + h, b + k) lies in D, we have
(9.35)
where 0  θ  1. Here we have introduced the notation
to represent the value of the expression
at the point (a, b).
This result is obtained by repeated use of the chain rule. Setting x = a + ht and
y = b + kt, where 0  t  1, we obtain
g(t) = f(a + ht, b + kt)
which is a function of one variable, so that, from Theorem 9.4, it has a Taylor 
expansion
where 0  θ  1. The derivatives of g are found using the chain rule:

and, in general,
(r = 0, 1, 2, … , n)
Putting t = 1 into the Taylor expansion of g gives the required result.
The same method can be used to extend the result to as many variables as we please.
For the function f(x), where x = (x1, x2, … , xn), we have
(9.36)
where 0  θ  1, provided that all the partial derivatives exist and are continuous.
By setting h = x −a and k = y −b in (9.35), we have the following alternative form
of the Taylor expansion:

which is referred to as the Taylor expansion of f(x, y) about the point (a, b).
Example 9.39
Obtain the Taylor series of the function f(x, y) = sin xy about the point (1, 
π), neglecting
terms of degree three and higher.
Solution
From (9.37) the required series is
Since f(x, y) = sin xy,

Hence, neglecting terms of degree three and higher,
There appears to be no command in MATLAB for determining directly the Taylor
series expansion of f(x, y) about a point (a, b). In MAPLE the ﬁrst n terms in such
an expansion may be obtained using the multivariable Taylor command
readlib(mtaylor):
mtaylor(f(x,y), [x = a,y = b], n);
For example, considering Example 9.39, the MAPLE commands
readlib(mtaylor):
mtaylor(sin(x*y), [x = 1, y = Pi/3],3);
return the ﬁrst three terms of the series as
1–2÷3 +

which checks with the answer given in the solution.
Using the maple command, such an expansion may be obtained in MATLAB
using the command
maple(‘mtaylor(f(x,y),[x = a,y = b],n)’)
Considering Example 9.39, check that the MATLAB commands
syms x y
f = sin(x*y);
s = maple(‘mtaylor(sin(x*y),[x = 1,y = pi/3],3)’)
return the same answer as above.

9.7 TAYLOR’S THEOREM FOR FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES
767
9.7.2
Optimization of unconstrained functions
In Section 8.5 we considered the problem of determining the maximum and minimum
values of a function f(x) of one variable. We now turn our attention to obtaining the
maximum and minimum values of a function f(x, y) of two variables. Geometrically
z = f(x, y) represents a surface in three-dimensional space, with z being the height of
the surface above the x–y plane. Suppose that f(x, y) has a local maximum value at
the point (a, b), as illustrated in Figure 9.18(a). Then for all possible (small) values of
h and k
f(a, b)  f(a + h, b + k)
so that the difference (increment)
∆f = f(a + h, b + k) −f(a, b)
is negative. Then, provided that the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, using
Taylor’s theorem we can express ∆f in terms of the partial derivatives of f(x, y) 
evaluated at (a, b):
where h and k may be negative or positive numbers. Since h and k are small, the sign
of ∆f depends on the sign of
That is, the sign of ∆f depends on the values of h and k. But for a maximum value of
f(x, y) at (a, b) the sign of ∆f must be negative whatever the values of h and k. This
implies that for a maximum to occur at (a, b), ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y must be zero there.
If f(x, y) has a local minimum at (a, b), as illustrated in Figure 9.18(b), then
f(a, b)  f(a + h, b + k)
and, using the above argument, we ﬁnd that for a local minimum to occur at (a, b), ∂f/∂x
and ∂f/∂y must again be zero.

Thus a ﬁrst necessary condition for a maximum or a minimum is
In terms of differentials, this means that
df = 0
at (a, b)
Points at which this occurs are called stationary points of the function and the values
of the function at those points are called its stationary values. When this condition is
satisﬁed, we have
Putting
we deduce that the sign of ∆f depends on the sign of the second differential
d2f = Rh2 + 2Shk + Tk2
Rearranging, we have, provided that R ≠0,
d2f =
(R2h2 + 2RShk + RTk2) =
[(Rh + Sk)2 + (RT −S2)k2]
If RT −S2  0, the sign of d2f is independent of the values of h and k; while if
RT −S2  0, its sign depends on those values. Thus a second necessary condition for a
maximum or minimum value to occur at (a, b) is that
Note that
. If strict inequality is satisﬁed, the sign of ∆f depends 
on R = ∂2f/∂x2. If ∂2f/∂x2  0, there is a minimum at (a, b). If ∂2f/∂x2  0, there is a
maximum at (a, b).
By expressing d2f as
d2f =
[(TK + Sh)2 + (RT −S2)h2],
T ≠0
we could equally well have deduced that there is a minimum at (a, b) if ∂2f/∂y2  0 and
a maximum at (a, b) if ∂2f/∂y2  0, assuming the above strict inequality.
If
then the sign of ∆f depends on the values of h and k, and along some paths through
(a, b) the function has a maximum value while along other paths it has a minimum
value. Such a point is called a saddle point, as illustrated in Figure 9.18(c).

9.7 TAYLOR’S THEOREM FOR FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES

The contours of a function often show clearly where maximum or minimum or saddle
points occur, as illustrated in Figure 9.19.
Summary
(1) A necessary condition for the function f(x, y) to have a stationary value at (a, b)
is that
(2) 
then the stationary point is a local maximum.
(3) 
then the stationary point is a local minimum.
(4) 
then the stationary point is a saddle point.
(5) 
we cannot draw a conclusion, and the point may be a maximum, minimum or saddle
point. Further investigation is required, and it may be necessary to consider the third-
order terms in the Taylor series.

Nature of stationary

Solution
= 6x2 + 6y2 −150
and
= 12xy −9y2
For a stationary point both of these partial derivatives are zero, which gives
x2 + y2 = 25
and
y(4x −3y) = 0
From the second equation we see that either y = 0 or 4x = 3y. Putting y = 0 in the ﬁrst
equation gives x = ±5, so that the points (5, 0) and (−5, 0) are solutions of the equa-
tions. Putting x =
y into the ﬁrst equation gives y = ±4, so that the points (3, 4) and
(−3, −4) are also solutions of the equation. Thus the function has stationary points at

Next we have to classify these points as maxima or minima or saddle points.

9.7 TAYLOR’S THEOREM FOR FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES
771
To illustrate the use of MATLAB for determining and classifying the stationary
points of a function of two variables we consider the function of Example 9.40. The
MATLAB commands
syms x y
f = 2*x^3 + 6*x*y^2 - 3*y^3 - 150*x;
fx = diff(f,x); fy = diff(f,y); [X,Y] = solve(fx,fy)
return the two column vectors X and Y giving the stationary points as (5,0), 
(−5,0), (3,4) and (−3,−4). Next we determine the second partial derivatives and 
evaluate
at each of the stationary points, using the commands
fxx = diff(f,x); fxy = diff(fx,y); fyy = diff(fy,y);
delta = fxx*fyy - fxy^2;
and substituting the coordinates of the four points
subs(delta,{x,y},{X(1),Y(1)}) giving ans = 3600
subs(delta,{x,y},{X(2),Y(2)}) giving ans = 3600
subs(delta,{x,y},{X(3),Y(3)}) giving ans = -3600
subs(delta,{x,y},{X(4),Y(4)}) giving ans = -3600
For the ﬁrst two points delta > 0 so we look at the sign of fxx or fyy
subs(fxx,{x,y},{X(1),Y(1)}) giving ans = 60 so (5,0) is a 
minimum point
subs(fxx,{x,y},{X(2),Y(2)}) giving ans = −60 so (−5,0) is a 
maximum point
For the last two points delta < 0 so (3,4) and (−3,4) are both saddle points. The
contour plot can be investigated using the command
ezcontour(f,[10,10])
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are:
f:= f(x,y); fx: = diff(f,x); fy:= diff(f,y); 
stat:= solve({fx = 0,fy = 0},{x,y});
giving the four stationary points in form {a, b}
fxx:= diff(f,x,x); fxy:= diff(f,x,y); fyy:= diff(f,y,y);
delta:= fxx*fyy - fxy^2;
subs(stat[1],delta); subs(stat[2],delta);
subs(stat[3],delta); subs(stat[4],delta);
subs(stat[1],fxx); subs(stat[2],fxx);
The process indicated above can be extended to functions of as many variables as we
please. At a stationary point the ﬁrst differential df, is zero, so that all the ﬁrst partial
derivatives are zero there. If, at that stationary point, the second differential d2f is negative

9.7 TAYLOR’S THEOREM FOR FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES

9.7.4
Optimization of constrained functions
As we have seen in Exercises 9.7.3, Questions 82 and 85–87, there are frequent situ-
ations in engineering applications when we wish to obtain the stationary values of 
functions of more than one variable and for which the variables themselves are subject
to one or more constraint conditions. The general theory for these applications is 
discussed in the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics. Here
we will show the technique for solving such problems.
Example 9.41
Obtain the extremum value of the function
f(x, y) = 2x2 + 3y2
subject to the constraint 2x + y = 1.
Solution
In this particular example it is easy to eliminate one of the two variables x and y.
Eliminating y, we can write f(x, y) as
f(x, y) = f(x) = 2x2 + 3(1 −2x)2 = 14x2 −12x + 3
We can now apply the techniques used for functions of one variable to obtain the
extremum value. Differentiating gives
f ′(x) = 28x −12
and
f ″(x) = 28
An extremal value occurs when f ′(x) = 0; that is, x =
, and, since f ″
 0, this
corresponds to a minimum value. Thus the extremum is a minimum fmin =
at x =
,
y =
.
In Example 9.41 we were fortunate in being able to use the constraint equation to 
eliminate one of the variables. In practice, however, it is often difﬁcult, or even impos-
sible, to do this, and we have to retain all the original variables. Let us consider the
general problem of obtaining the stationary points of f(x, y, z) subject to the constraint
g(x, y, z) = 0. We shall refer to such points as conditional stationary points.
At stationary points of f(x, y, z) we have
(9.38)
This implies that the vector (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z) is perpendicular to the vector 
(dx, dy, dz). Since g(x, y, z) = 0
(9.39)
Thus, the vector (∂g/∂x, ∂g/∂y, ∂g/∂z) is also perpendicular to the vector (dx, dy, dz).
This implies that the vector (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z) is parallel to the vector 
(∂g/∂x, ∂g/∂y, ∂g/∂z) and that we can ﬁnd a number λ such that

Geometrically this means that the level surface of the objective function f(x, y, z)
touches the constraint surface g(x, y, z) = 0 at the stationary point.
This can be neatly summarized by writing φ(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z) −λg(x, y, z).
Then f(x, y, z) will have a stationary point subject to the constraint 
g(x, y, z) = 0 when
and
g(x, y, z) = 0
(9.41)
This gives four equations to determine (x, y, z; λ) for the stationary point. The scalar
multiplier λ is called a Lagrange multiplier and the function φ(x, y, z) is called the
auxiliary function.
Example 9.42
Rework Example 9.41 using the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Solution
Here we need to obtain the extremum of the function
f(x, y) = 2x 2 + 3y2
subject to the constraint
g(x, y) = 2x + y −1 = 0
The auxiliary function is
φ(x, y, z) = f(x, y) −λg(x, y)
= 2x2 + 3y2 −λ(2x + y −1)
and we ﬁnd that the conditional extrema of f(x, y) are given by
g(x, y) = 0
that is
= 4x −2λ = 0
(9.42)
= 6y −λ = 0
(9.43)
g(x, y) = 2x + y −1 = 0
(9.44)
Solving (9.42)–(9.44) gives
so that the conditional extremal value of f(x, y) is 
and occurs at x =
, y =
.
It is clear from the level curves of f(x, y), shown in Figure 9.21, that the function 
has a minimum at ( , ). In general, however, to determine the nature of the con-
ditional stationary point, we have to resort to Taylor’s theorem and consider the sign of
the difference f(x + h, y + k) −f(x, y). Taking a point near ( , ), say (
+ h, 
+ k),

that still satisﬁes the constraint 2x + y −1 = 0, we have 2h + k = 0, so that k = −2h.
Hence a near point satisfying the constraint is (
+ h, 
−2h), and thus
= 14h2  0
Since this is positive, it follows that the point is a minimum, conﬁrming the result of
Example 9.41.
In general, classifying conditional stationary points into maxima, minima or saddle
points can be very difﬁcult, but in the majority of engineering applications this can be
done using physical reasoning.
Example 9.43
Find the dimensions of the cuboidal box, without a top, of maximum capacity whose
surface area is 12 m2.
Solution
If the dimensions of the box are x × y × z then we are required to maximize
f(x, y, z) = xyz
subject to the constraint
xy + 2xz + 2yz = 12
(9.45)
The auxiliary function is
φ(x, y, z) = xyz + λ(xy + 2xz + 2yz −12)
and the equations we have to solve are
= yz + λ(y + 2z) = 0

Then, from (9.49) and (9.45),

Substituting into (9.46)–(9.48) in succession and dividing throughout by common
factors gives
(9.50)

(9.52)
Subtracting (9.51) from (9.50) gives
hence
y = x
(since clearly z ≠0)
Putting this into (9.52), we have
or
yz = 2
Substituting this and x = y into (9.50) gives
that is
y2 = 4,
or
y = 2 (since y  0)
It then follows that x = 2, z = 1. Thus the required dimensions are 2m × 2 m × 1m, and
it follows from physical considerations that this corresponds to the maximum volume,
since the minimum volume is zero (Figure 9.22).

the solve command are given in alphabetical order.)
Example 9.44
Apply the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the design problem of Section 2.10.
Solution
Here the objective function A(l, b, h, t) is subject to the constraint function C(l, b, h)
where
A(l, b, h, t) = (lb + 6bh + 2hl)t + (2l + 6b + 12h)t2 + 12t3
and C(l, b, h) = lhb = K
and t and K are constants.
The auxiliary function is
φ(l, b, h, λ) = A(l, b, h, t) + λ[C(l, b, h) −K]
and we ﬁnd the conditional extrema of A are given by
and C(l, b, h) = K
Thus
(b + 2h)t + 2t2 + λhb = 0

(l + 6h)t + 6t2 + λlh = 0

So b = 2h, l = 6h with lbh = K. Thus 12h3 = K and h = (K/12)1/3 as before.
The Lagrange multiplier method outlined above may be extended to a function of any
number of variables. It also extends naturally to situations where there is more than 
one constraint equation by introducing the equivalent number of Lagrange multipliers.
In general, if f(x1, x2, … , xn) is a function of n variables subject to m ( n) constraints
gi(x1, … , xn) = 0
(i = 1, 2, … , m)
then, to determine the constrained stationary values of f(x1, x2, … , xn), the procedure is
to set up the auxiliary function
φ(x1, x2, … , xn) = f(x1, x2, … , xn) + λ1g1 + … + λmgm
and solve the resulting m + n equations
( j = 1, 2, … , n)

Often the algebraic equations involved in this method of solution are not amenable
to algebraic solution and numerical methods are used. These are described in detail in

Engineering application: deflection of a built-in column
In this section we consider an example in which the techniques developed in Section 9.4
may be used to solve an engineering problem.
The deﬂection y(x) of a column buckling under its own weight satisﬁes the differ-
ential equation
(9.56)
where E is Young’s modulus, I the second moment of area of the cross-section and w
is the weight per unit run of the column. The deﬂection of the built-in column shown
in Figure 9.23 also satisﬁes the conditions
at x = 0
and
y = 0
and
at x = l
where l is the length of the column. We need to ﬁnd the greatest height attainable for
the column without collapse.
To make the algebraic manipulations easier, we ﬁrst simplify the differential equation.
Putting x = ct gives

with the conditions
at t = 0
and
f(t) = 0
at t = l(EI/w)−1/3 = T
Assuming that f(t) has a Maclaurin series expansion, we may write it as
f(t) = a0 + a1t + a2t2 + a3t3 + … + antn + …
Differentiating this, we have
f ′(t) = a1 + 2a2t + 3a3t2 + … + nantn−1 + (n + 1)an+1tn + …
and
f ″(t) = 2a2 + 6a3t + 12a4t2 + … + n(n −1)antn−2 + …
Since f ′(0) = 0, we deduce at once that a1 = 0. Since f(t) satisﬁes the differential equa-
tion (9.57), we deduce on substitution that
2a2 + 6a3t + 12a4t2 + … + n(n −1)antn−2 + …
= −a0t −a1t2 −a2t3 − … − antn+1 − …
This expression is true for all values of t, with 0  t  T, so we deduce from Property
(i) of polynomials given in Section 2.4.1 that the coefﬁcients of each power of t on each
side of the equation are equal. That is,
2a2 = 0
(coefﬁcient of t 0)
6a3 = −a0
(coefﬁcient of t1)
12a4 = −a1
(coefﬁcient of t 2)
and so on. In general, the coefﬁcient of t r (obtained by setting n −2 = r on the left-hand
side and n + 1 = r on the right-hand side) yields
(r + 2)(r + 1)ar+2 = −ar−1
This recurrence relation enables us to calculate ar+3 in terms of ar as
(9.58)
Thus
and so on.
Since we deduced earlier, using the condition f ′(0) = 0, that a1 = 0, some terms can
be eliminated immediately, and we have

Since a2 = 0 (from the coefﬁcient of t0), we have
a5 = 0,
a8 = 0,
…
We are therefore left with
f(t) = a0 + a3t3 + a6t6 + a9t9 + …
Substituting for a3, a6, a9, … in terms of a0, using (9.58) gives
So far we have only applied the condition at t = 0. Now we apply the condition at
t = T, namely f(T) = 0. This gives
so that either
This means that there is no deﬂection (a0 = 0) unless
The smallest value of T that satisﬁes this equation gives the critical height of the 
column. At that height the value of a0 becomes arbitrary (and non-zero), and the column
buckles. A ﬁrst approximation to the critical value of T can be found by solving the
quadratic equation (in T 3)
giving T3 = 8.292. This may be reﬁned using the Newton–Raphson procedure (9.19),
eventually giving the critical length L in terms of E, I and w:
L = 1.99(EI/w)1/3
The detailed calculation is left as an exercise for the reader.

Engineering application: streamlines in ﬂuid dynamics
As we mentioned in Section 9.6.10, differentials often occur in mathematical model-
ling of practical problems. An example occurs in ﬂuid dynamics. Consider the case of
steady-state incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow in two dimensions. Using rectangular cartesian
coordinates (x, y) to describe a point in the ﬂuid, let u and v be the velocities of the ﬂuid
in the x and y directions respectively. Then by considering the ﬂow in and ﬂow out 
of a small rectangle, as shown in Figure 9.24, per unit time, we obtain a differential

relationship between u(x, y) and v(x, y) that models the fact that no ﬂuid is lost or gained
in the rectangle; that is, the ﬂuid is conserved.
The velocity of the ﬂuid q is a vector point function. The values of its components
u and v depend on the spatial coordinates x and y. The ﬂow into the small rectangle in
unit time is
u(x, y)∆y + v(x, y)∆x
where x lies between x and x + ∆x, and y lies between y and y + ∆y. Similarly, the ﬂow
out of the rectangle is
u(x + ∆x, z)∆y + v(x, y + ∆y)∆x
where x lies between x and x + ∆x and z lies between y and y + ∆y. Because no ﬂuid 
is created or destroyed within the rectangle, we may equate these two expressions, 
giving
u(x, y)∆y + v(x, y)∆x = u(x + ∆x, z)∆y + v(x, y + ∆y)∆x
Rearranging, we have
Letting ∆x →0 and ∆y →0 gives the continuity equation
The ﬂuid actually ﬂows along paths called streamlines, so that there is no ﬂow across
a streamline. Thus from Figure 9.25 we deduce that
v ∆x = u ∆y
and hence
v dx −u dy = 0
The condition for this expression to be an exact differential is
or
This is satisﬁed for incompressible ﬂow since it is just the continuity equation, so that
we deduce that there is a function ψ(x, y), called the stream function, such that
It follows that if we are given u and v, as functions of x and y, that satisfy the continuity
equation then we can ﬁnd the equations of the streamlines given by ψ(x, y) = constant.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
10.1
Introduction
The essential role played by mathematical models in both engineering analysis and
engineering design has been noted earlier in this book. It often happens that, in creating
a mathematical model of a physical system, we need to express such relationships 
as ‘the acceleration of A is directly proportional to B’ or ‘changes in D produce pro-
portionate changes in E with constant of proportionality F’. Such statements naturally
give rise to equations involving derivatives and integrals of the variables in the model
as well as the variables themselves. Equations which introduce derivatives are called
differential equations, those which introduce integrals are called integral equations
and those which introduce both are called integro-differential equations. Generally
speaking, integral and integro-differential equations are rather more difﬁcult to solve
than purely differential ones. This chapter starts with a discussion of the general char-
acteristics of differential equations and then deals with ways of solving ﬁrst-order
differential equations. It is concluded by an examination of the solution of differential
equations of second and higher orders.
Before we go any further in our study of differential equations we need to note that
there are two main categories of differential equation. We met, in Chapter 8, the idea
of differentiation of a function of a single variable, and then, in Chapter 9, the idea of
partial differentiation of functions of more than one variable. Differential equations may
involve either ordinary or partial derivatives; those which involve only ordinary differ-
entials are called ordinary differential equations and those involving partial differentials
are partial differential equations, commonly abbreviated to ODEs and PDEs.
For the remainder of this chapter we shall concentrate on learning the most common
techniques for solving ordinary differential equations. This is not because partial differ-
ential equations are not important in engineering. On the contrary, partial differential
equations have many applications, but the methods used to solve them are signiﬁcantly
different from the methods used for ordinary differential equations. The solution of partial
differential equations is covered in the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics.
10.2
Engineering examples
Firstly we shall give some examples of engineering problems which naturally give rise
to differential equations. In due course we shall meet techniques which allow us to ﬁnd
solutions to these equations and hence to make predictions about the engineering 
systems modelled.
10.2.1
The take-off run of an aircraft
Aeronautical engineers need to be able to predict the length of runway that an aircraft
will require to take off safely. To do this, a mathematical model of the forces acting on
the aircraft during the take-off run is constructed, and the relationships holding between
the forces are identiﬁed. Figure 10.1 shows an aircraft and the forces acting on it. If the
mass of the aircraft is m, gravity causes a downward force mg. There is a ground
reaction force through the wheels, denoted by G, and an aerodynamic lift force L. The
engines provide a thrust T, which is opposed by an aerodynamic drag D and a rolling

10.2 ENGINEERING EXAMPLES
791
resistance from contact with the ground R. Since the aircraft is rolling along the 
runway, it is not accelerating vertically, so the vertical forces are in balance and the 
vertical equation of motion yields
L + G = mg
(10.1)
On the other hand, the aircraft is accelerating along the runway, so the horizontal 
equation of motion is
T −D −R =
(10.2)
where s is the distance the aircraft has travelled along the runway.
We know from experimental evidence that both aerodynamic lift and aerodynamic
drag forces on a body vary roughly as the square of the velocity of the airﬂow relative
to the body. We shall therefore choose to model the lift and drag forces as proportional
to velocity squared. The rolling resistance is also known to be roughly proportional to the
reaction force between ground and aircraft. Thus we make the modelling assumptions
L = αv2,
D = βv2
and
R = µG
Substituting for L, D and R in (10.1) and (10.2) and eliminating G results in the 
equation
−(µα −β)v2 + µmg = T
or, replacing v by ds/dt,
(10.3)
Thus our model of the aircraft travelling along the runway provides an equation
relating the ﬁrst and second time derivatives of the distance travelled by the aircraft, 
the thrust provided by the engines and various constants – the model is expressed as a
differential equation for the distance s travelled along the runway. The model is not yet
really complete, since we have not speciﬁed how the thrust varies. The thrust could, of
course, vary with time (the pilot could open or close the throttles during the take-off
run), and may also vary with the forward speed of the aircraft. On the other hand, we
could just assume that thrust is constant. Also, the constants m, µ, α and β need to be
determined. This information might be provided by measurements on the aircraft or on
scale models of it, by other calculations or by engineers’ estimates.
Once the model is complete it could be used, for instance, to predict the length
of runway needed by the aircraft to attain ﬂying speed. Flying speed is, of course, the

speed at which the lift (αv2) is equal to the weight (mg) of the aircraft. For a real
aircraft our model would probably need to be made more elaborate, including, for
instance, the angle of attack of the wing, which would change during the take-off run
as the balance between aerodynamic and ground forces changed and as the pilot (or
autopilot) changed the control surface settings.
10.2.2
Domestic hot-water supply
The second example involves modelling the heating of water in a hot-water storage
tank. Figure 10.2 shows schematically an ‘indirect’ domestic hot-water tank. In this
design of a hot-water system the central heating boiler, or other primary source of heat,
supplies hot water to a caloriﬁer (which takes the form of a coiled pipe) inside the
hot-water storage tank. The main mass of water in the tank is then heated by the hot
water passing through the caloriﬁer coil. We wish to calculate how quickly the hot
water in the tank will heat up.
We shall assume that, to a good approximation, during heating, convection ensures
that the main mass of water in the tank is well mixed and at a uniform temperature Tw.
The heating water ﬂows into the caloriﬁer at a speed U at a temperature Tin.The outﬂow
from the caloriﬁer is at temperature Tout. The cross-sectional area of the caloriﬁer tube
is A. The mass ﬂowrate of heating water through the caloriﬁer is therefore ρAU, 
where ρ is the density of water, and the rate of heat loss from the heating water is 
ρAU(Tin −Tout)c, where c is the speciﬁc heat of water. The heat capacity of the main
mass of water in the tank is ρVc, where V is the volume of the tank, and so the rate of
gain of heat in the main mass of water is given by
The tank is well insulated, so, to a ﬁrst approximation, we shall assume that the heat
loss from the external shell of the tank is negligible. The rate of heat gain of the main
mass of water is therefore equal to the rate of heat loss from the heating water; that is,
AU(Tin −Tout) =
(10.4)
where it is assumed that no hot water is being drawn off.

We should also expect that the difference in temperature of the heating water
ﬂowing in and that ﬂowing out of the caloriﬁer will be greater the cooler the mass of
water in the tank. If we assume direct proportionality of these two quantities, we may
express this modelling assumption as
Tin −Tout = α(Tin −Tw)
(10.5)
where α is a constant of proportionality. Eliminating Tout between (10.4) and (10.5)
leads to the equation
+ AUαTw = AUαTin
(10.6)
Thus we have a differential equation relating the temperature of the water in the tank
and its derivative with respect to time to the temperature of the heating water supplied
by the boiler. The equation also involves various constants determined by the charac-
teristics of the system. We will see later, in Question 35, Exercises 10.5.11, how this
equation can be solved to ﬁnd Tw as a function of time.
10.2.3
Hydro-electric power generation
Our third example is drawn from the sphere of hydraulic engineering. Figure 10.3
shows a cross-section through a hydro-power generation plant. Water, retained behind
a dam, is drawn off through a conduit and drives a generator. In order to control the
power generated, there is also a control valve in series with the generator. The conduit
from the dam to the generator is typically quite long and of considerable cross-section,
so that it contains many tonnes of water. Hence, when the control valve is opened or
closed, the power generated does not increase or decrease instantaneously. Because of
the large mass of water in the conduit that must be accelerated or decelerated, the 
system may take several minutes or even tens of minutes to attain its new equilibrium
ﬂowrate and power generation level. We wish to predict the behaviour of the system
when the control valve setting is changed.
The pressure at the entry to the conduit will be atmospheric plus ρgh, where ρ is the
density of the water in the dam and h is the depth of the entry below the water surface.
It is known that for ﬂow in pipes, to a good approximation, the volume ﬂowrate is 
proportional to the pressure differential between the ends of the pipe. We shall express
this as
Q = α∆p1
where Q is the volume ﬂowrate through the conduit, α is a constant and ∆p1 is the pres-
sure difference between the two ends of the conduit. It is also known that the pressure

794
INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
loss across a turbine such as the generator in this case is proportional to the discharge
(volume ﬂow through the turbine), so we can write
∆p2 = βQ
where ∆p2 is the pressure loss across the generator and β is a characteristic of the
generator. The discharge of the turbine must, of course, be equal to the ﬂowrate through
the conduit feeding the turbine. In a similar way, the pressure differential across a
control valve is also proportional to its discharge, so we have
∆p3 = γQ
where ∆p3 is the pressure loss across the valve and γ is a constant whose value will vary
with the setting of the control valve. The total pressure differential between the entry to
the conduit and the exit from the control valve is ρgh. Hence the pressure differential
between the ends of the conduit is ρgh −∆p2 −∆p3. If this exceeds ∆p1, the pressure
differential needed to maintain the ﬂow through the conduit at its current level, then
the mass of water in the conduit will accelerate and the volume ﬂowrate through the
system will increase; if it is less than ∆p1 then the mass of water will decelerate and
the volume ﬂow will decrease. The net force on the mass of water in the conduit is the
excess pressure differential multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the conduit, A, say.
The mass of water is ρAd, where d is the length of the conduit, and Q, the volume
ﬂowrate, is vA, where v is the velocity of the water in the conduit. Thus we can write
(ρgh −∆p1 −∆p2 −∆p3)A =
Assuming that the cross-sectional area of the conduit is constant and substituting for
∆p1, ∆p2 and ∆p3, we can rewrite this as
that is,
(10.7)
We ﬁnd that this simple model of the hydro-power generation system results in an
equation involving the volume ﬂowrate through the system and its time derivative and,
of course, various constants expressing physical characteristics of the system. One of
these constants, γ, is determined by the setting of the valve controlling the whole system.
Again we will see later (Question 36, Exercises 10.5.11) how (10.7) can be solved to ﬁnd
the ﬂowrate Q as a function of time.
10.2.4
Simple electrical circuits
The fourth example comes from electrical engineering. A resistor, an inductor and a
capacitor are connected in a series circuit with a switch and battery, as shown in Fig-
ure 10.4. The switch is a spring-biased one that, when released, moves immediately on
to contact B. While the switch is held against contact A, a current ﬂows in the circuit.
When it is released, the circuit must eventually become quiescent, with no current
ﬂowing. What is the manner of the decay to the quiescent state?

10.3 THE CLASSIFICATION OF ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
795
We know from experiment that the relation V = iR holds between the potential dif-
ference across the resistor and the current ﬂowing through a pure resistor of resistance
R. In the same way, we know that for a pure capacitor of capacitance C we have
V = q/C, where V is the potential difference across the capacitor and q is the charge on
it, and that for a pure inductor of inductance L we have V = L di/dt. If we assume that
the circuit components are a pure resistor, inductor and capacitor respectively, and that
the switch and the wires joining the components have negligible resistance, capacitance
and inductance, then, when the switch is in contact with B, the total potential difference
around the circuit must be zero and we have
This differential equation appears to relate two different quantities: the current i ﬂowing
in the circuit and the charge q on the capacitor. Of course, these two quantities are not
independent. If the current is ﬂowing then the charge on the capacitor must be increasing
or decreasing (depending on the direction in which the current is ﬂowing). The principle
of conservation of charge tells us that the current is equal to the rate of change of
charge; that is, we must have
(10.8)
We can use this in one of two ways: either to eliminate q, in which case we obtain the
integro-differential equation
or to eliminate i, in which case we obtain the differential equation
Alternatively, differentiating either of these equations with respect to time, we obtain
(10.9)
The equations are, of course, equivalent, but the ﬁnal form is probably the most usual
and most tractable of the three.
Thus we have found that a simple analysis of an LCR electrical circuit results in a
differential equation for one of the variables: either the charge on the capacitor in the
circuit or the current in the circuit. Once the equation has been solved to yield one of
these, the other can be obtained from (10.8). Equation (10.9) is an example of a type 
of differential equation which occurs widely in engineering applications. A general
method for solving such equations will be developed in Section 10.8.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
are many techniques for solving differential equations – different methods being appli-
cable to different kinds of equation – so, before we go on to study these methods, it is
necessary to understand the various categories and classiﬁcations of ordinary differen-
tial equations. We shall then be in a position to recognize the overall characteristics of
an equation and identify which techniques will be useful in its solution.
10.3.1
Independent and dependent variables
The ﬁrst type of classiﬁcation we must understand is that of the variables occurring in a
differential equation. The variables with respect to which differentiation occurs are called
independent variables while those that are differentiated are dependent variables.
This terminology reﬂects the fact that what a differential equation actually expresses is the
way in which the dependent variable (or variables) depends on the independent variable.
A single ordinary differential equation has one independent variable and one dependent
variable. In much the same way as algebraic equations may occur in sets that must be
solved simultaneously, we can also have sets of coupled ordinary differential equations. In
this case there will be a single independent variable but more than one dependent variable.
Example 10.1
In the ordinary differential equation
the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is f. In the pair of coupled 
ordinary differential equations
the independent variable is t and the dependent variables are x and y.
10.3.2
The order of a differential equation
Another classiﬁcation of differential equations is in terms of their order. The order of a
differential equation is the degree of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation.
The order of an equation is not affected by any power to which the derivatives may be
raised.

are both ﬁrst-order equations as is the equation
despite the term in (dx/dt)2.
10.3.3
Linear and nonlinear differential equations
Differential equations are also classiﬁed as linear or nonlinear. We may informally
deﬁne linear equations as those in which the dependent variable or variables and their
derivatives do not occur as products, raised to powers or in nonlinear functions. We
shall meet a more formal deﬁnition of a linear differential equation in Section 10.8.
Nonlinear equations are those that are not linear. Linear equations are an important
category, since they have useful simplifying properties. Many of the nonlinear equa-
tions that occur in engineering science cannot be solved easily as they stand, but can 
be solved, for practical engineering purposes, by the process of replacing them with 
linear equations that are a close approximation – at least in some region of interest –
and then studying the solution of the linear approximation. We shall see more of this
later.
Example 10.3

are all nonlinear differential equations, the ﬁrst because the derivative dx/dt is squared,
the second because of the product between the dependent variable x and its derivative,
and the third because of the nonlinear function, sin x, of the dependent variable.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
10.3.4
Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations
There is a further classiﬁcation that can be applied to linear equations: the distinction
between homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations. In all the examples we have
presented so far the differential equations have been arranged so that all terms contain-
ing the dependent variable occur on the left-hand side of the equality sign, and those
terms that involve only the independent variable and constant terms occur on the right-
hand side. This is a standard way of arranging terms, and aids in the identiﬁcation of
equations. Speciﬁcally, when linear equations are arranged in this way, those in which
the right-hand side is zero are called homogeneous equations and those in which it 
is non-zero are nonhomogeneous equations. Expressed another way, each term in a
homogeneous equation involves the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. In a
nonhomogeneous equation there is at least one term that does not contain the independ-
ent variable or any of its derivatives.
Example 10.4
The equations
and
are both homogeneous ordinary differential equations, while
and
are both nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equations.
Example 10.5
Classify the equations (10.3), (10.6), (10.7) and (10.9) derived in the engineering 
examples of Section 10.2.

Solving differential equations
So far we have said that differential equations are equations which express relationships
between a dependent variable and the derivatives of that variable with respect to the
independent variable. We are now going to study some methods of solving differential
equations. First, though, we should give some thought to exactly what form we expect
that solution to take.
When we solve an algebraic equation we expect the solution to be a number (e.g. the 
solution of the equation 4x + 9 = 7 is x = −) or, perhaps, a set of numbers (e.g. the 
solution of a cubic polynomial equation like x 3 −5x 2 + 8x −12 = 0 is that x is one of a
set of three real or complex numbers). Again, equations involving vectors and matrices
have solutions that are constant vectors or one of a set of constant vectors. Differential
equations, on the other hand, are equations involving not a simple scalar or vector
variable but a function and its derivatives. The solution of a differential equation is,
therefore, not a single value (or one from a set of values) but a function (or a family of
functions). With this in mind let us proceed.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
10.4.1
Solution by inspection
The solution to some differential equations can be obtained by recalling some results
about differentiation.
Example 10.6
Faced with the differential equation
(10.10)
we might recall that if x(t) = e−4t then
In other words, the function x(t) = e−4t is a solution of the differential equation.
Example 10.7
The differential equation
(10.11)
may be solved by recollecting that
Therefore, the function x(t) = sinλt satisﬁes the differential equation.
Many differential equations can be solved by inspection in a similar manner to
Examples 10.6 and 10.7. Solution by inspection requires the recognition of the equa-
tion and its connection to a familiar result in differentiation. It is therefore dependent
upon experience and inspiration, and for this reason is only practical for solving the
simplest differential equations.
MATLAB and MAPLE can both readily solve differential equations like these. 
In MATLAB, using the Symbolic Math Toolbox, analytic solutions of differential
equations are computed using the dsolve command. The letter D denotes differen-
tiation. The dependent variable is that preceded by D, whilst the default independent
variable is t. Thus the general solution of the ﬁrst-order differential equation
is given by the commands
syms x
dsolve(‘equation’)
In MAPLE the routine used is also called dsolve thus:

So, to solve Example 10.6, we would use
dsolve(‘Dx = –4*x’)
in MATLAB and
dsolve(diff(x(t),t) = –4*x(t));
in MAPLE. The answer returned by MATLAB is C1*exp(–4*t) and by MAPLE is
_C1*exp(–4*t). In each case C1 (or _C1) indicates an arbitrary constant. The reason
for this will become apparent in the next section. To solve Example 10.7 we could use
dsolve(‘D2x + lambda^2*x’,’t’)
in MATLAB and
dsolve(diff(x(t),t,t) + lambda^2*x(t));
in MAPLE. Notice here that MATLAB requires a second argument to specify what
is the independent variable (otherwise how does the package know that lambda is
not the independent variable?) whereas MAPLE does not require this because it has 
effectively been speciﬁed in the expression diff(x(t),t,t) for 
.
10.4.2
General and particular solutions
Examples 10.6 and 10.7 also illustrate a pitfall of solving equations in this way. The func-
tion x(t) = e−4tis certainly a solution of the equation in Example 10.6, but so is the function
x(t) = Ae−4t, where A is an arbitrary constant. The function x(t) = sin λt is certainly a
solution of the equation in Example 10.7, but so is the function x(t) = A sinλt + B cosλt,
where A and B are arbitrary constants. Differential equations in general have this 
property – the most general function that will satisfy the differential equation contains
one or more arbitrary constants. Such a function is known as the general solution of the
differential equation. Giving particular numerical values to the constants in the general
solution results in a particular solution of the equation. The general solution normally
contains a number of arbitrary constants equal to the order of the differential equation.
Example 10.8
Find the general solution of the differential equation
Solution
This differential equation can be solved by twice integrating both sides, remembering
that each time we integrate the right-hand side an unknown constant of integration is
introduced. Thus integrating
twice we have

and
x(t) =
t3 −e3t + At + B
This solution contains two arbitrary constants, A and B. The equation 
is a
second-order differential equation so, as a general rule, we would expect two constants.
When solving differential equations, we should, as a rule, seek the most general solu-
tion that is compatible with the constraints imposed by the problem. If we do not do
this, we run the risk of neglecting some feature of the problem which may have 
serious implications for the performance, efﬁciency or even safety of the engineering
equipment or system being analysed.
10.4.3
Boundary and initial conditions
The arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation can often be
determined by the application of other conditions.
Example 10.9
Find the function x(t) that satisﬁes the differential equation
and that has the value 2.5 when t = 0.
Solution
We noted in Section 10.4.2 that x(t) = Ae−4t is a solution of the differential equation
(This can be checked by differentiating x(t) to ﬁnd 
and substituting into the differ-
ential equation.) But the solution x(t) = Ae−4t does not have the value 2.5 at t = 0 as
required by the example. We can impose the boundary condition by x(0) = 2.5 to give
Ae−4×0 = Ae−0 = A = 2.5
so the solution that satisﬁes the boundary condition is x(t) = 2.5e−4t.
Additional conditions on the solution of a differential equation such as that in 
Example 10.9 are called boundary conditions. In the special case in which all the
boundary conditions are given at the same value of the independent variable the bound-
ary conditions are called initial conditions. In many circumstances it is convenient to
consider a differential equation as incomplete until the boundary conditions have been
speciﬁed. A differential equation together with its boundary conditions is referred to as
a boundary-value problem, unless the boundary conditions satisfy the requirements

for being initial conditions, in which case the differential equation together with its
boundary conditions is referred to as an initial-value problem.
Example 10.10
Find the function x(t) that satisﬁes the initial-value problem
x(0) = 4,
λ ≠0
Solution
We know from Section 10.4.2 that the general solution of this differential equation is
x(t) = A sinλt + Bcosλt
We can conﬁrm this by differentiating x(t) twice and substituting into the differential
equation to demonstrate that this x(t) does satisfy the differential equation. With this
x(t) we have
= λA cosλt −λBsinλt
Applying the initial conditions gives rise to the equations
0A + 1B = 4
λA + 0B = 3
and hence to the solution
x(t) =
sinλt + 4 cosλt
which is the particular solution of the initial value problem.
Example 10.11
Find the function x(t) that satisﬁes the boundary-value problem
x(0) = 4,
λ ≠0
Solution
As in the previous example, the general solution of the differential equation is
x(t) = A sin λt + Bcosλt
and so
= λA cosλt −λBsinλt
Applying the boundary conditions gives rise to the equations
0A + 1B = 4
−λA + 0B = 3
and hence to the particular solution
x(t) = −
sinλt + 4 cosλt

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Obviously, since a ﬁrst-order differential equation has only one arbitrary constant in 
its solution, only one boundary condition is needed to determine the constant, and 
so the boundary condition of a ﬁrst-order equation can always be treated as an initial
condition. For higher-order equations (and for sets of coupled ﬁrst-order equations) the
distinction between initial-value and boundary-value problems is an important one, 
not least because, generally speaking, initial-value problems are easier to solve than
boundary-value problems.
MATLAB and MAPLE can both solve initial and boundary-value problems. In
MAPLE the differential equation and its boundary conditions must be presented as
a set (indicated by placing curly brackets round the list of equation and boundary
conditions), thus for Example 10.11 the solution is given by the commands
ode:= diff(x(t),t,t) + lambda^2*x(t)
dsolve({ode,x(0) = 4,D(x)(Pi/lambda) = 3});
Notice that the derivative boundary condition uses D(x) to denote 
. In MATLAB 
the boundary conditions are deﬁned by a separate list of boundary conditions, thus
for Example 10.10 we have
dsolve(‘D2x + lambda^2*x’,’x(0) = 4,Dx(Pi/lambda) = 3’,‘t’)
In MATLAB we deﬁne the derivative boundary condition using Dx to denote 
.
In both MAPLE and MATLAB an initial-value problem would be solved in exactly
the same way; the difference would be that both boundary conditions would be
deﬁned at the same value of the independent variable.
10.4.4
Analytical and numerical solution
We have seen that some differential equations are so simple that they can be solved by
inspection, given a reasonable knowledge of differentiation. There are many differential
equations that are not amenable to solution in this way. For some of these we may be
able, by the use of more complex mathematical techniques, to ﬁnd a solution that
expresses a functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
We say that such equations have an analytical solution. In the case of other equations
we may not be able to ﬁnd a solution in such a form – either because no suitable 
mathematical technique for ﬁnding the solution exists or because there is no analytical
solution. In these cases the only way of solving the equation is by the use of numerical
techniques, leading to a numerical solution.
An analytical solution is almost always preferable to a numerical one. This is chieﬂy
because an analytical solution is a mathematical function, and so the numerical value
of the dependent variable can be computed for any value of the independent variable.
In contrast with this, a numerical solution takes the form of a table giving the values of
the dependent variable at a discrete set of values of the independent variable. The value
of the dependent variable corresponding to any value of the independent variable not
included in that discrete set can only be computed by interpolation from the table (or
by repeating the whole numerical solution process, making sure the desired value of the
independent variable is included in the solution set).

If the differential equation being solved contains parameters (such as the constant λ
in Example 10.7) then an analytical solution of the equation will contain that parameter.
The behaviour of the solution of the equation as the parameter value changes can be
readily understood. For a numerical solution the parameter must be given a speciﬁc
numerical value before the solution is computed. The numerical solution will then be
valid only for that value of the parameter. If the behaviour of the solution as the para-
meter value is changed is of interest then the equation must be solved repeatedly using
different parameter values.
When we obtain an analytical solution of a differential equation without its asso-
ciated boundary conditions, the arbitrary constants in the solution are effectively par-
ameters of the solution. A numerical solution to a differential equation cannot be obtained
unless the boundary conditions are speciﬁed. This is one reason why it is sometimes
convenient to refer to the whole problem (differential equation and boundary conditions)
as a unit rather than consider the differential equation separately from its boundary 
conditions.
Another reason for preferring an analytical solution to a numerical one when such 
a solution is available is that the work required to obtain a numerical solution is gen-
erally much greater than that required to obtain an analytical one. On the other hand,
most of this greater quantity of work can be delegated to a computer (and this may
sometimes be considered to be an argument for numerical solutions being preferable to
analytical ones).
Finally, it should be pointed out that this somewhat simpliﬁed overview of the 
contrast between analytical and numerical solutions of differential equations is becoming
increasingly blurred by the availability of computerized symbolic manipulation systems
(often known as computer algebra systems). We shall, in the remainder of this chapter,
be studying methods for both the numerical and analytical solution of ordinary differ-
ential equations.

10.5 FIRST-ORDER ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
807
All of the differential equations in Questions 3, 4 and 6 of Exercises 10.4.5 could be
solved using MATLAB or MAPLE. For example, using MAPLE, Questions 3(c)
would be solved by
dsolve(diff(x(t),t,t) = exp(4*t));
Question 4(g) could be solved in MATLAB as
dsolve(‘Dx = 2*x’,’x(0) = 1’,’t’)
and the ﬁrst part of Question 6 would be solved by
ode:= E*I*diff(y(x),x,x) = 1/2*w*(a – x)^2 – R*(a – x);
dsolve({ode,y(0) = 0,D(y)(0) = 0});
or by
ode = ’E*I*D2y = 1/2*w*(a – x)^2 – R*(a – x)’
dsolve(ode,’y(0) = 0,Dy(0) = 0’,’x’)
in MAPLE and MATLAB respectively. Now, for practice, use MAPLE or MATLAB
to check your solutions to Questions 3, 4 and 6.

First-order ordinary differential equations
For the next three sections of this chapter we are going to concentrate our attention on
the solution of ﬁrst-order differential equations. This is not as restrictive as it might at
ﬁrst sight seem, since higher-order differential equations can, using a technique that we
shall meet in Section 10.11.2, be expressed as sets of coupled ﬁrst-order differential
equations. Some of the methods used for the solution of ﬁrst-order equations, particu-
larly the numerical techniques, are also applicable to such sets of coupled ﬁrst-order
equations, and thus may be used to solve higher-order differential equations.
10.5.1
A geometrical perspective
Most ﬁrst-order differential equations can be expressed in the form
(10.12)
Expressing the equation in this form means that, for any point in the t–x plane for which
f(t, x) is deﬁned, we can compute the value of dx/dt at that point. If we then do this for
a grid of points in the t–x plane, we can draw a picture such as Figure 10.5. At each
point a short line segment with gradient dx/dt is drawn. Such a diagram is called the
direction ﬁeld of the differential equation. Obviously, there is a gradient direction at
every point of the t–x plane, but it is equally obviously only practical to draw in a ﬁnite
number of them, as we have done in Figure 10.5. The equation whose direction ﬁeld is
drawn in Figure 10.5 is in fact
but the same process could be carried out for any equation expressible in the form (10.12).

for the equation 
dx/dt = x(1 −x)t.

Solutions of 
dx/dt = x(1 −x)t
superimposed on 
its direction ﬁeld.
A solution of the differential equation is a function relating x and t (that is, a curve
in the t–x plane) which satisﬁes the differential equation. Since the solution function
satisﬁes the differential equation, the solution curve has the property that its gradient is
the same as the direction of the direction ﬁeld of the equation at every point on the
curve; in other words, the direction ﬁeld consists of line segments that are tangential to
the solution curves. With this insight, it is then fairly easy to infer what the solution
curves of the equation whose direction ﬁeld is shown in Figure 10.5 must look like.
Some typical solution curves are shown in Figure 10.6.
By continuing this process, we could cover the whole t–x plane with an inﬁnite 
number of different solution curves. Each solution curve is a particular solution of the
differential equation. Since we are considering ﬁrst-order equations, we expect the gen-
eral solution to contain one unknown constant. Giving a speciﬁc value to that constant
derives, from the general solution, one or other of the particular solution curves. In other
words, the general solution, with its unknown constant, represents a family of solution
curves. The curves drawn in Figure 10.6 are particular members of that family.

Example 10.12
Sketch the direction ﬁeld of the differential equation
Verify that x(t) = Ce−t/2 is the general solution of the differential equation. Find the
particular solution that satisﬁes x(0) = 2 and sketch it on the direction ﬁeld. Do the same
with the solution for which x(3) = −1.
Solution
The direction ﬁeld is shown in Figure 10.7. Substituting the function x(t) = Ce−t/2 into
the equation immediately veriﬁes that it is a solution. The initial condition x(0) = 2
implies C = 2. The condition x(3) = −1 implies C = −e3/2. Both of these curves are
shown on Figure 10.7, and are readily seen to be in the direction of the direction ﬁeld
at every point.

Sketching the direction ﬁeld of an equation is not normally used as a way of solving
a differential equation (although, as we shall see later, one of the simplest techniques
for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations may be interpreted as
following lines through a direction ﬁeld). It is, however, a very valuable aid to under-
standing the nature of the equation and its solutions. The sketching of direction ﬁelds
is made very much simpler by the use of computers and particularly computer graphics.
In cases of difﬁculty or uncertainty about the solution of a differential equation, sketching
the direction ﬁeld often greatly illuminates the problem.

MAPLE has tools for examining direction ﬁeld plots of differential equations. For
instance, Questions 9 and 10 of Exercises 10.5.2 can be completed with the follow-
ing commands
with(DETools):
ode:= diff(x(t),t) = –2*x(t)/(t – 3);
dfieldplot(ode, x(t),t = –2..2,x = –3..3);
ode:= diff(x(t),t) = (1–t)*x(t)/t
dfieldplot(ode, x(t),t = –2..4,x = –3..3)
Notice that we must give MAPLE a range of both the independent variable and the
dependent variable over which to construct the direction ﬁeld.
10.5.3
Solution of separable differential equations
So far we have only solved differential equations such as (10.10) and (10.11) whose
solution is immediately obvious. We are now going to introduce some techniques that
allow us to solve somewhat more difﬁcult equations. These techniques are basically
ways of manipulating differential equations into forms in which their solutions become

obvious. The ﬁrst method applies to equations that take what is known as a separable
form. If the function f(t, x) in the ﬁrst-order differential equation
is such that the equation can be manipulated (by algebraic operations) into the form
(10.13)
then the equation is called a separable equation. We may ﬁnd an expression for the
solution of such equations by the following argument.
Integrating both sides of (10.13) with respect to t we have
(10.14)
Now let
Then
and
Integrating both sides of this equation with respect to t we have
Hence we have
Finally, substituting 
in (10.14) we have
(10.15)
so we have demonstrated that if a differential equation can be manipulated into the form
of (10.13) then (10.15) holds. If the functions g(x) and h(t) are integrable then (10.15)
leads to a solution of the differential equation.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Example 10.13
Solve the equation
,
x  0
Solution
This equation can be written as
and so is a separable equation. The solution is given by
That is,
ln x = 2t 2 + C
or
x =
= C′
,
where C′ = eC
Note: The cases x  0 and x = 0 can be solved by allowing C′ to be negative and zero
respectively.
Note that a constant of integration has been introduced. We might expect such constants
as a result of the integration of both left- and right-hand sides. However, if two constants
had been introduced, they could then have been combined into one constant either on
the left- or the right-hand side of the equation, so only one constant is actually necessary.

Either MAPLE or MATLAB can be used to solve any of the equations above.
Sometimes the answers given may differ in exact form from those given in the
‘Answers to Exercises’ section at the end of this book. For instance, both MAPLE
and MATLAB give three answers to Question 14(e). This is because the differential
equation can be solved to show x(t)3 = 12[t(ln(t) −1) + 1]. There are then, of course,
three cube roots of a real quantity, one real and two complex conjugates. Sometimes,
the physical origins of a problem will indicate that the real root is the one of inter-
est. In the answers in this chapter, where multiple roots exist, only the principal root
is usually given.
10.5.5
Solution of differential equations of
= f
form
Some differential equations, while not being in separable form, can be transformed, by
means of a substitution, into separable equations. The best-known example of this is a
differential equation of the form
(10.16)
Note: Equations of the form (10.16) are sometimes called ‘homogeneous equations’,
but this use of the term homogeneous is different from the deﬁnition of homogeneous
equations which we gave in Section 10.3.4.

Solution of exact differential equations
Some ﬁrst-order differential equations are of a form (or can be manipulated into a form)
that is called exact. Since such equations can be solved readily, it would be useful to
be able to recognize them or, better still, to have a test for them. In this section we shall
see how exact equations are solved, and develop a test that allows us to recognize them.
The solution of exact equations depends on the following observation: if h(t, x) is a
function of the variables x and t, and the variable x is itself a function of t, then, by the
chain rule of differentiation,
Now if a ﬁrst-order differential equation is of the form
p(t, x)

and a function h(t, x) can be found such that
(10.18)
then (10.17) is equivalent to the equation
and the solution must be
h(t, x) = C
Example 10.15
Solve the differential equation
2xt
+ x 2 −2t = 0
Solution
If h(t, x) = x 2t −t 2 then
so the differential equation takes the form
(x 2t −t 2) = 0
and the solution is
x 2t −t 2 = C
Assuming t  0 and C  0 the solution can be written as
Thus we can solve equations of the form (10.17) provided that we can guess a func-
tion h(t, x) that satisﬁes the conditions (10.18). If such a function is not immediately
obvious, there are two possibilities: ﬁrst there is no such function, and, secondly, there
is such a function but we don’t see what it is. We shall now develop a test that enables us
to answer the question of whether an appropriate function h(t, x) exists and a procedure
that enables us to ﬁnd such a function if it does exist. If

so, for a function h(t, x) satisfying (10.18) to exist, the functions p(t, x) and q(t, x) must
satisfy
(10.19)
If p(t, x) and q(t, x) do not satisfy this condition then there is no point in seeking a
function h(t, x) satisfying (10.18).
If p(t, x) and q(t, x) do satisfy (10.19), how do we ﬁnd the function h(t, x) that
satisﬁes (10.18) and thus solve the equation (10.17)? It may be that, as in Example 10.14,
the function is obvious. If not, it can be obtained by solving the two equations (10.18)
independently and then comparing the answers, as in Example 10.15.
Example 10.16
Solve the differential equation
(lnsint −3x 2)
+ x cot t + 4t = 0
Solution
First, since
(lnsint −3x 2) = cot t =
(x cot t + 4t)
an appropriate function h(t, x) may exist. Now
= lnsin t −3x 2
gives
h = x lnsin t −x 3 + C1(t)
and
= x cot t + 4t
gives
h = x lnsin t + 2t 2 + C2(x)
where C1(t) and C2(x) are arbitrary functions of t and x respectively. Comparing the two
results, we see that
h(t, x) = xlnsin t −x 3 + 2t 2
satisﬁes (10.18) and so the solution of the differential equation is
x lnsin t −x 3 + 2t 2 = C
Notice that the solution, in this case, is not an explicit expression for x(t) in terms of t,
but an implicit equation relating x(t) and t, to be precise, a cubic polynomial in x with
coefﬁcients which are functions of t.
If an initial condition had been given, say x(
) = 3, we would impose that initial
condition on the implicit equation resulting in a value for the constant of integration C, thus
x( π) = 3
giving
3 ln sin
π −33 + 2 × 02 = C or 0 −27 + 0 = C
so
x3 −x ln sin t −2t2 −27 = 0

Both MAPLE and MATLAB can solve differential equations of the exact differen-
tial type. One drawback of systems such as MAPLE and MATLAB is that they 
may seek an explicit solution and, in doing so, give an answer which is of a more
complex form and correspondingly less easily comprehended than the solution which
might be obtained by a human. For instance, we can use MAPLE or MATLAB to
solve Example 10.16. In MAPLE we would use
ode:= (ln(sin(t)) – 3*x(t)^2)*diff(x(t),t) +
x(t)*cot(t) + 4*t;
dsolve(ode);
and an equivalent form in MATLAB. The solution given in Example 10.16 is an
implicit one which takes the form of a cubic function of x(t), x(t)3 −ln[sin(t)]x(t) −
2t 2 + C = 0. There is a general method for solving cubic algebraic equations which
the computer algebra packages use to derive an explicit form for x(t). There are, of
course, three roots of the cubic equation, all of which are much less immediately
understandable than the implicit solution given above.
All of the questions in Exercises 10.5.8 may be tackled with MAPLE or 
MATLAB. Some of the solutions derived in that way will appear different from
those given in the Answers section but, with some persistence, all can be shown
equivalent. Use of the simplify command can often be helpful.

Solution of linear differential equations
In Section 10.3.3 we deﬁned linear differential equations. The most general ﬁrst-order
linear differential equation must have the form
(10.20)
where p(t) and r(t) are arbitrary functions of the independent variable t. We shall ﬁrst
see how to solve the slightly simpler equation
(10.21)

will be exact if
Since g and p are functions of t only, this reduces to
which is a separable equation with solution
That is,
ln g =p(t)dt
or
g(t) = ek(t),
where k(t) =p(t)dt
Hence, multiplying (10.21) throughout by g(t), we obtain
ek(t)
+ p(t)ek(t)x = 0
or
Hence, integrating with respect to t, we have
ek(t)x = C
so the solution can be written as
x = Ce−k(t)
The function g(t) is called the integrating factor for the differential equation. This
name expresses the property that, whilst

is an exact integral. In other words g(t) is a factor which makes the expression 
integrable.
This technique can, in fact, be used on the full equation (10.20). In that case, mul-
tiplying by the integrating factor g(t), we obtain
ek(t)
+ p(t)ek(t)x = ek(t)r(t)
or
(ek(t)x) = ek(t)r(t)
Then, integrating with respect to t, we have
ek(t)x =ek(t)r(t)dt + C
and the solution
(10.22)
Thus (10.22) is an analytical solution of (10.20). The form of the solution can be simpliﬁed
considerably if p(t)dt has a simple analytical form, as in Examples 10.17 and 10.18.
Example 10.17
Solve the ﬁrst-order linear differential equation

Solution
We have shown that the integrating factor for a linear differential equation is
g(t) = ek(t)

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Now the left-hand side is a perfect differential (the form of the integrating factor is 
chosen to make this so), so the differential equation can be written
and integrating both sides of the equation with respect to t we have
Finally, dividing both sides by
we ﬁnd
Note: In evaluating t dt for the integrating factor we have taken the constant of 
integration to be zero. Any other value of the constant of integration would also 
produce a valid (but more complicated!) integrating factor.
Example 10.18
Solve the ﬁrst-order linear initial-value problem

We have shown that the integrating factor for a linear differential equation is
g(t) = ek (t)
where
In this case
Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by this integrating factor we have

So, ﬁnally,
Again both MAPLE and MATLAB can be used to solve ﬁrst-order linear differen-
tial equations. The preceding examples and the exercises in the next section can all
be tackled in this way. It is worth observing that this is not at all unexpected.
Computer algebra packages derive their results by following standard mathematical
methods, which have been programmed by the package designers. All of the ana-
lytical methods for solving differential equations described in this chapter are well
known and certainly included in the spectrum of methods incorporated into the
dsolve and related routines used by MAPLE and by MATLAB. MAPLE provides
a facility to see ‘inside’ the workings of the dsolve routine. The commands
infolevel[dsolve]:= 3:
ode:= t*diff(x(t),t) + x(t) = t^2;
dsolve({ode,x(2) = 1/3});
cause MAPLE to give a commentary on the different methods it is trying out in order
to solve the differential equation. In this case it almost immediately identiﬁes the
equation as ‘1st order linear’ and solves it by that method.

Solution of the Bernoulli differential equations
Differential equations of the form
are called Bernoulli differential equations. If the index α is 0 or 1 then the equation

substitution. Let
y(t) = x(t)1−α
then
giving
Substituting for 
in the original differential equation 
+ p(t)x = q(t)xα we have
Now dividing throughout by xα we have
But y(t) = x(t)1−α, so substituting for x(t)1−α and multiplying throughout by (1 −α) 
we obtain
which is a linear differential equation for y(t). Hence we can solve the equation for y(t)
using the method of Section 10.5.9.
Example 10.19
Solve the differential equation

Numerical solution of ﬁrst-order ordinary

for ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations, we are now going to see how ﬁrst-order
ordinary differential equations can be solved numerically. In this chapter we shall only
study the simplest such method, Euler’s method. Many more sophisticated (but also
more complex) methods exist which yield solutions more efﬁciently, but space precludes
their inclusion in this introductory treatment.

10.6 NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF FIRST-ORDER ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

10.6.1
A simple solution method: Euler’s method
In Section 10.5.1 we met the concept of the direction ﬁeld of a differential equation
We noted that solutions of the differential equation are curves in the t–x plane to which
the direction ﬁeld lines are tangential at every point. This immediately suggests that 
a curve representing a solution can be obtained by sketching on the direction ﬁeld a
curve that is always tangential to the lines of the direction ﬁeld. In Figure 10.8 a way
of systematically constructing an approximation to such a curve is shown.
Starting at some point (t0, x0), a straight line with gradient equal to the value of the
direction ﬁeld at that point, f(t0, x0), is drawn. This line is followed to a point with
abscissa t0 + h. The ordinate at this point is x0 + hf(t0, x0), which we shall call X1. The
value of the direction ﬁeld at this new point is calculated, and another straight line from
this point with the new gradient is drawn. This line is followed as far as the point with
abscissa t0 + 2h. The process can be repeated any number of times, and a curve in the
t–x plane consisting of a number of short straight line segments is constructed. The
curve is completely deﬁned by the points at which the line segments join, and these can
obviously be described by the equations
t1 = t0 + h,
X1 = x0 + hf(t0, x0)
t2 = t1 + h,
X2 = X1 + hf(t1, X1)
t3 = t2 + h,
X3 = X2 + hf(t2, X2)
\
\
tn+1 = tn + h,
Xn+1 = Xn + hf(tn, Xn)
These deﬁne, mathematically, the simplest method for integrating ﬁrst-order differential
equations. It is called Euler’s method. Solutions are constructed step by step, starting
from some given starting point (t0, x0). For a given t0 each different x0 will give rise to

a different solution curve. These curves are all solutions of the differential equation, but
each corresponds to a different initial condition.
The solution curves constructed using this method are obviously not exact solutions
but only approximations to solutions, because they are only tangential to the direc-
tion ﬁeld at certain points. Between these points, the curves are only approximately 
tangential to the direction ﬁeld. Intuitively, we expect that, as the distance for which 
we follow each straight line segment is reduced, the curve we are constructing will
become a better and better approximation to the exact solution. The increment h in the
independent variable t along each straight-line segment is called the step size used in
the solution. In Figure 10.9 three approximate solutions of the initial-value problem
x(0) = 0.91
(10.23)
for step sizes h = 0.05, 0.025 and 0.0125 are shown. These steps are sufﬁciently small
that the curves, despite being composed of a series of short straight lines, give the illu-
sion of being smooth curves. The equation (10.23) actually has an analytical solution,
which can be obtained by separation:
The analytical solution to the initial-value problem is also shown in Figure 10.9 for
comparison. It can be seen that, as we expect intuitively, the smaller the step size the
more closely the numerical solution approximates the analytical solution.
Example 10.20
The function x(t) satisﬁes the differential equation
and the initial condition x(1) = 2. Use Euler’s method to obtain an approximation to the
value of x(2) using a step size of h = 0.1.

10.6.2
Analysing Euler’s method
We have introduced Euler’s method via an intuitive argument from a geometrical under-
standing of the problem. Euler’s method can be seen in another light – as an application
of Taylor series. The Taylor series given in Section 9.4.2 applied to a function x(t) gives
(10.24)
Using this formula, we could, in theory, given the value of x(t) and all the derivatives
of x at t, compute the value of x(t + h) for any given h. If we choose a small value for h
then the Taylor series truncated after a ﬁnite number of terms will provide a good approxi-
mation to the value of x(t + h). Euler’s method can be interpreted as using the Taylor
series truncated after the second term as an approximation to the value of x(t + h).
In order to distinguish between the exact solution of a differential equation and a
numerical approximation to the exact solution (and it should be appreciated that all
numerical solutions, however accurate, are only approximations to the exact solution),
we shall now make explicit the convention that we used in the last section. The exact
solution of a differential equation will be denoted by a lower-case letter and a 
numerical approximation to the exact solution by the corresponding capital letter. Thus,
truncating the Taylor series, we write
X(t + h) = x(t) +  
= x(t) + hf(t, x)
(10.25)
Applying this truncated Taylor series, starting at the point (t0, x0) and denoting t0 + nh
by tn, we obtain
X(t1) = X(t0 + h) = x(t0) + hf(t0, x0)
X(t2) = X(t1 + h) = X(t1) + hf(t1, X1)
X(t3) = X(t2 + h) = X(t2) + hf(t2, X2)

which is just the Euler-method formula obtained in Section 10.6.1. As an additional
abbreviated notation, we shall adopt the convention that x(t0 + nh) is denoted by xn, 
X(t0 + nh) by Xn, f(tn, xn) by fn, and f(tn, Xn) by Fn. Hence we may express Euler’s
method, in general terms, as the recursive rule
X0 = x0
Xn+1 = Xn + hFn
(n  0)
The advantage of viewing Euler’s method as an application of Taylor series in this way
is that it gives us a clue to obtaining more accurate methods for the numerical solution
of differential equations. It also enables us to analyse in more detail how accurate
Euler’s method may be expected to be. We can abbreviate (10.24) to 
x(t + h) = x(t) + hf(t, x) + O(h2)
where O(h2) covers all the terms involving powers of h greater than or equal to h2.
Combining this with (10.25), we see that
X(t + h) = x(t + h) + O(h2)
(10.26)
(Note that in obtaining this result we have used the fact that signs are irrelevant in deter-
mining the order of terms; that is, −O(h p) = O(h p).) Equation (10.26) expresses the fact
that at each step of the Euler process the value of X(t + h) obtained has an error of order
h2, or, to put it another way, the formula used is accurate as far as terms of order h. 
For this reason Euler’s method is known as a ﬁrst-order method. The exact size of 
the error is, as we intuitively expected, dependent on the size of h, and decreases as 
h decreases. Since the error is of order h2, we expect that halving h, for instance, will
reduce the error at each step by a factor of four.
This does not, unfortunately, mean that the error in the solution of the initial-value
problem is reduced by a factor of four. To understand why this is so, we argue as
follows. Starting from the point (t0, x0) and using Euler’s method with a step size h to
obtain a value of X(t0 + 4), say, requires 4/h steps. At each step an error of order h2 is
incurred. The total error in the value of X(t0 + 4) will be the sum of the errors incurred
at each step, and so will be 4/h times the value of a typical step error. Hence the total
error is of the order of (4/h)O(h2); that is, the total error is O(h). From this argument we
should expect that if we compare solutions of a differential equation obtained using
Euler’s method with different step sizes, halving the step size will halve the error in the
solution. Examination of Figure 10.9 conﬁrms that this expectation is roughly correct
in the case of the solutions presented there.
Example 10.21
Let Xa denote the approximation to the solution of the initial-value problem
x(0) = 1
obtained using Euler’s method with a step size h = 0.1, and Xb that obtained using a step
size of h = 0.05. Compute the values of Xa(t) and Xb(t) for t = 0.1, 0.2, … , 1.0. Com-
pare these values with the values of x(t), the exact solution of the problem. Compute the
ratio of the errors in Xa and Xb.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Solution
The exact solution, which may be obtained by separation, is
The numerical solutions Xa and Xb and their errors are shown in Figure 10.11. Of
course, in this ﬁgure the values of Xa are recorded at every step whereas those of Xb are
only recorded at alternate steps.
Again, the ﬁnal column of Figure 10.11 shows that our expectations about the effects
of halving the step size when using Euler’s method to solve a differential equation are
conﬁrmed. The ratio of the errors is not, of course, exactly one-half, because there are
some higher-order terms in the errors, which we have ignored.
Both MAPLE and MATLAB can be used to obtain numerical solutions of differ-
ential equations. Both encapsulate highly sophisticated numerical methods, which
enable the production of very accurate numerical solutions. The Euler method
described above is the simplest numerical method available and it might be con-
sidered somewhat perverse to use MAPLE or MATLAB to obtain an Euler method
solution when much more accurate methods are available within the packages.
Nonetheless, the numerical results in column Xa of Figure 10.11 could be obtained
in MAPLE as follows.
odeprob:= {diff(x(t),t) = x(t)^2/(t + 1),x(0) = 1};
oseq:= array([seq(0.1*i,i = 0..10)]):
oput:= dsolve(odeprob,numeric,
method = classical[foreuler],
output = oseq,stepsize = 0.1);
evalm(oput[2,1]);
The results in column Xb of Figure 10.11 could be obtained by changing the step-
size argument in the dsolve routine to stepsize=0.05. A more extensive 
programming effort would be required to obtain the same numerical results through
MATLAB.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
10.6.3
Using numerical methods to solve engineering problems
In Example 10.21 the errors in the values of Xa and Xb are quite large (up to about 14%
in the worst case). While carrying out computations with large errors such as these is
quite useful for illustrating the mathematical properties of computational methods, in
engineering computations we usually need to keep errors very much smaller. Exactly
how small they must be is largely a matter of engineering judgement. The engineer
must decide how accurately a result is needed for a given engineering purpose. It is then
up to that engineer to use the mathematical techniques and knowledge available to 
carry out the computations to the desired accuracy. The engineering decision about the
required accuracy will usually be based on the use that is to be made of the result. If,
for instance, a preliminary design study is being carried out then a relatively approxi-
mate answer will often sufﬁce, whereas for ﬁnal design work much more accurate
answers will normally be required. It must be appreciated that demanding greater accur-
acy than is actually needed for the engineering purpose in hand will usually carry a
penalty in time, effort or cost.
Let us imagine that, for the problem posed in Example 10.21, we had decided we
needed the value of x(1) accurate to 1%. In the cases in which we should normally
resort to numerical solution we should not have the analytical solution available, so we
must ignore that solution. We shall suppose then that we had obtained the values of
Xa(1) and Xb(1) and wanted to predict the step size we should need to use to obtain a
better approximation to x(1) accurate to 1%. Knowing that the error in Xb(1) should be
approximately one-half the error in Xa(1) suggests that the error in Xb(1) will be roughly
the same as the difference between the errors in Xa(1) and Xb(1), which is the same as
the difference between Xa(1) and Xb(1); that is, 0.17266. One per cent of Xb(1) is roughly
0.03, that is, roughly one-sixth of the error in Xb(1). Hence we expect that a step size
roughly one-sixth of that used to obtain Xb will sufﬁce; that is, a step size h = 0.008 33.
In practice, of course, we shall round to a more convenient non-recurring decimal 
quantity such as h = 0.008. This procedure is closely related to the Aitken extrapolation
procedure introduced in Section 7.5.3 for estimating limits of convergent sequences 
and series.
Example 10.22
Compute an approximation X(1) to the value of x(1) satisfying the initial-value problem
x(0) = 1
by using Euler’s method with a step size h = 0.008.
Solution
It is worth commenting here that the calculations performed in Example 10.21 could
reasonably be carried out on any hand-held calculator, but this new calculation requires
125 steps. To do this is on the boundaries of what might reasonably be done on a hand-
held calculator, and is more suited to a computer. Repeating the calculation with a step
size h = 0.008 produces the result X(1) = 3.213 91.
We had estimated from the evidence available (that is, values of X(1) obtained using
step sizes h = 0.1 and 0.05) that the step size h = 0.008 should provide a value of X(1)
accurate to approximately 1%. Comparison of the value we have just computed with
the exact solution shows that it is actually in error by approximately 1.4%. This does

not quite meet the target of 1% that we set ourselves. This example therefore serves,
ﬁrst, to illustrate how, given two approximations to x(1) derived using Euler’s method
with different step sizes, we can estimate the step size needed to compute an approxi-
mation within a desired accuracy, and, secondly, to emphasize that the estimate of 
the appropriate step size is only an estimate, and will not guarantee an approximate
solution to the problem meeting the desired accuracy criterion. If we had been more
conservative and rounded the estimated step size down to, say, 0.005, we should have
obtained X(1) = 3.23043, which is in error by only 0.9% and would have met the
required accuracy criterion.
Since we have mentioned in Example 10.22 the use of computers to undertake the 
repetitious calculations involved in the numerical solution of differential equations, it
is also worth commenting brieﬂy on the writing of computer programs to implement
those numerical solution methods. While it is perfectly possible to write informal,
unstructured programs to implement algorithms such as Euler’s method, a little atten-
tion to planning and structuring a program well will usually be amply rewarded – 
particularly in terms of the reduced probability of introducing ‘bugs’. Another reason
for careful structuring is that, in this way, parts of programs can often be written in
fairly general terms and can be re-used later for other problems. The two pseudocode
algorithms in Figures 10.12 and 10.13 will both produce the table of results in 
Example 10.21. The pseudocode program of Figure 10.12 is very speciﬁc to the 
problem posed, whereas that of Figure 10.13 is more general, better structured, and
more expressive of the structure of mathematical problems. It is generally better to aim
at the style of Figure 10.13.
Both the MAPLE and MATLAB packages include a procedural programming lan-
guage with all the basic structures of such languages. The pseudocode algorithms 
in Figures 10.12 and 10.13 can be implemented as programs in both MAPLE 
and MATLAB. But, again, it would be perverse to do so when very much more
sophisticated numerical algorithms are packaged within the standard procedures 
of both languages. Nevertheless, either package could be used as a programming
environment for implementing simple programs to complete Questions 43–45 in

Engineering application: analysis of damper
performance
In this section we shall carry out a modest engineering design exercise that will illustrate
the modelling of an engineering problem using ﬁrst-order differential equations and the
solution of that problem using the techniques we have met so far in this chapter.
A small engineering company produces, among other artefacts, hydraulic dampers
for specialized applications. One of the test rigs used by the company to check the 
quality and consistency of the operational characteristics of its output is illustrated in
Figure 10.14. A carriage carrying a mass, which can be altered to suit the damper 
under test, is projected along a track of very low friction at a carefully controlled speed.
At the end of the track the carriage impacts into a buffer which is connected to the
damper under test. Immediately prior to impact the carriage passes through a pair of
photocells whose output is used to measure the carriage speed accurately. The mass of

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
the buffer is very small compared with the mass of the carriage and test weight. The
time/displacement history of the damper as it is compressed by the impact of the 
carriage is recorded digitally. The apparatus can produce time/displacement graphs 
and time/compression speed graphs for dampers on test.
In order to interpret the test results, the company needs to know how a damper
should, in theory, behave under such a test. The simplest classical model of a damper
assumes that the resistance of the damper is proportional to the velocity of compression.
Since the mass of the buffer and damper components is small compared with the mass
of the test apparatus carriage, it is reasonable to assume that, on impact, the moving
components of the buffer and damper accelerate instantaneously to the velocity of the
carriage, with negligible loss of speed on the part of the carriage. Since the track is of
very low friction, it will be assumed that the only force decelerating the carriage is
that provided by the damper (this also means assuming the carriage is not moving
sufﬁciently fast for air resistance to have a signiﬁcant effect). With these assumptions,
the equation of motion of the carriage is
,
v(0) = U
(10.27)
where m is the mass of the carriage, v(t) is its speed and k is the damper constant. Time
is measured from the moment of impact and U is the impact speed of the carriage. The
damper constant describes the force produced by the damper per unit speed of com-
pression (and, for double-acting dampers, extension). The design engineer can adjust
this constant by altering the internal design and dimensions of the damper. Equation
(10.27) can be solved on sight, or by separation. The solution is
v = Ce−λt,
with λ = k/m
which, upon substituting in the initial conditions, becomes
v = Ue−λt
(10.28)
Writing v = dx/dt, where x is the compression of the damper and is taken as zero 
initially, this equation can be expressed as
x(0) = 0
This can be integrated directly, giving the solution, after substitution of the initial 
condition,
(10.29)
The velocity and displacement curves predicted by this model, (10.28) and (10.29),
show that as t →∞, v →0 and x →U/λ. Neither v nor x actually ever achieve these
limits! This does not seem very realistic, since it is observed in tests that, after a ﬁnite
and fairly short time (short at least when compared with inﬁnity), the carriage comes to
rest and the compression reaches a deﬁnite ﬁnal value. The behaviour predicted by the
simple model and the behaviour observed in tests do not quite agree. One possible
explanation of this mismatch is the presence in the damper of friction between the 
components. Such friction would produce an additional resistance in the damper that

does not vary with the speed of compression. The force resisting compression might
therefore be better modelled as kv + b, where b is some constant force, rather than just
kv. The compression of such a damper would be described by the equation
v(0) = U
(10.30)
Equation (10.30) is a linear ﬁrst-order equation whose solution is
or, substituting in the initial conditions,
(10.31)
This can be integrated again to provide displacement as a function of time:
(10.32)
Equation (10.31) predicts that the compression velocity of the damper will be zero when
(10.33)
at which time the compression of the damper will be
(10.34)
This model therefore seems more realistic.
Figures 10.15 and 10.16 show the velocity and displacement curves represented by
(10.28) and (10.29) and (10.31) and (10.32) for a test in which the carriage carries 
a mass of 2kg and travels at 1.5ms−1 at impact, the damper has a damping constant 
25Nsm−1 and the constant frictional force in the damper amounts to 1.5N.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The company perceives that one of the disadvantages of the classical hydraulic
damper is, as may be inferred from Figure 10.15, that the largest force, and hence the
largest deceleration of the damped object, is produced early in the history of the impact,
when the velocity is largest. This means that the object, whatever it is, must be able to
withstand this high deceleration. If a damper could be designed that produced a more
even force over the deceleration process, the maximum deceleration experienced by 
an object being stopped from a given speed in a given distance would be reduced. 
The company’s designers think they may have a solution to this problem – they have
devised a new pattern of damper with a patent internal mechanism such that the damp-
ing constant increases as the damper operates. The effect of this mechanism is that, 
during any given operating cycle, the damping constant may be expressed as k(1 + at),
where t is the time elapsed in the operating cycle. The internal mechanism is such that
in a short time after an operating cycle the effective damper constant returns to its 
initial state and the damper is ready for another operating cycle.
A model of this new design of damper is provided by the equation
= −k(1 + at)v −b,
v(0) = U
(10.35)
This is a linear ﬁrst-order differential equation. Applying the appropriate solution method
gives the solution as
where g(t) = t +
at2
The integral in this solution does not result in a simple expression for v(t), although it
can be expressed in terms of a standard tabulated function called the error function.
However, (10.35) can be solved numerically to produce v(t) in tabulated form.
Although we will not obtain x(t) immediately using this method, we could readily
derive x(t) from the tabulated values of v(t). Since
we can integrate both sides of this equation to obtain
and the integral can be evaluated numerically (see Section 8.10) using the tabulated 
values of v(t). However, in evaluating the performance of the damper it is the velocity
curve which is more important, and we shall content ourselves with demonstrating the
numerical solution of (10.35).
The company’s engineers would wish to devise a numerical method for integrating
the equation that will allow them to predict the performance of the damper for differ-
ent combinations of the operational parameters U, m, k, a and b. Hence the task is to
write a program that can be validated against some test cases and then be used with con-
siderable conﬁdence in other circumstances. If the value of a is taken to be 0 then the
program to solve (10.35) should produce the same results as the analytical solution
(10.31) of (10.30). This provides an appropriate test for the adequacy of the method and

step size chosen. A program written to integrate equation (10.35) by Euler’s method
produced the results in the table in Figure 10.17. Several test runs of the program 
were undertaken using different step sizes, and results using h = 0.000 01 (Va) and 
h = 0.000 005 (Vb) together with analytical solution (10.31) are shown in the ﬁgure.
It can be seen that the results using a step size of h = 0.000005 are in agreement with
the analytical solution to at least 4 decimal places, and the agreement between the two
numerical solutions Va and Vb is good to 4dp. This agreement suggests that the accuracy
of the numerical solution is adequate.
It therefore seems that a step size of h = 0.000005 will produce results that are accur-
ate to at least 4dp and probably more. Using this step size, the (v, t) traces shown in
Figure 10.18 were produced. First, for comparison, the predicted result of a test on a
standard damper described by (10.30) is shown. Secondly, the predicted result of a 
test with a new model of damper with a parameter a = 4 is shown. It can be seen that
the modiﬁed damper stops the carriage in a shorter time than the original model. The

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
velocity–time trace is also slightly straighter, indicating that the design objective of
making the deceleration more nearly uniform has been, at least in part, achieved. The
third trace shown is for a new model damper with the basic damper constant k reduced
to 17.5 and the parameter a kept at 4. This damper is able to halt the carriage in the
same time as the original unmodiﬁed damper, but, in so doing, the maximum deceler-
ation is somewhat smaller. This is the advantage of the new design that the company
hope to exploit in the market.
In this section we have seen how differential equations and numerical solution 
methods can be used to provide an analytical tool that the company can now use as a
routine design tool for predicting the performance of a new model damper with any
given combination of parameters. Such a tool is an invaluable aid to the designer,
whose task will usually be to specify appropriate parameters to meet an operational
requirement speciﬁed by a client, for instance something like ‘to be capable of halting
a mass M travelling at velocity U within a time T while subjecting it to a deceleration
of no more than D’.
It should also be commented here that we have completed the numerical work in 
this example using Euler’s method. In practice it would be far better to use a more
sophisticated method, which would yield a solution of equivalent accuracy while 
using a much larger time step and therefore much less computing effort. Although the
difference for a single computation would be very small (and, therefore, considerably 
outweighed by the additional programming effort of implementing a more complex
method), if we were undertaking a large number of comparative runs or creating a
design tool which would be used by many engineers over a long period of time then
such issues would be important.
10.8
Linear differential equations
Having dealt, in the last three sections, with ﬁrst-order differential equations we shall
now turn our attention to differential equations of higher orders. To begin with we 
shall restrict our attention to linear differential equations.
In Section 10.3.3 we deﬁned the concept of linearity and mentioned that the 
solutions of linear equations have important simplifying properties. In this section 
we are going to study these simplifying properties in more detail. Before we do so,
however, it is helpful to deﬁne some new notation.
10.8.1
Differential operators
We are familiar from Section 2.2 with the idea that a function is a mapping from a set
known as the domain of the function to another set, the codomain of the function. The
functions we have met so far have been ones whose domain and codomain have been
familiar sets, such as the set of all real numbers (or perhaps some subset of that set), the
set of integers or the set of complex numbers. There is, though, no reason why a func-
tion should not be deﬁned to have a domain and codomain consisting of functions. Such
functions are called operators. This name captures the idea that operators are functions
that transform one function into another function. If f is a function and φ is an operator
then φ[ f ] is another function.

10.8 LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
841
Example 10.23
Let the set A be the set of functions on the real numbers, that is, functions whose
domain and codomain are both the real numbers. The operator φ has domain A and is
deﬁned by
φ[ f(t)] = f(t)2
In other words, the effect of an operator φ on a function f is deﬁned by specifying the
function φ[ f(t)]. Thus for the φ deﬁned here
φ[3t2 −2t + 4] = 9t4 −12t3 + 28t2 −16t + 16
and
φ[sin t −t] = sin2t −2t sin t + t2
Example 10.24
The operator φ is deﬁned by
φ[ f(t)] = tf(t)2 −4f(t) + t2
Then tg(t)4 −4g(t)2 + t2 may be expressed as φ[g(t)2] and te2t −4et + t2 may be expressed
as φ[et].
Where no ambiguity is likely to result, it is permissible and conventionally acceptable to
write φ[ f(t)] as φf(t), that is, to omit the square brackets.
We may view the operation of differentiation as transforming a differentiable 
function to another function, its derivative. When we are going to take this view, we
often write the differentiation symbol separately from the function on which it will
operate; for instance, we write
This notation is already familiar in those contexts in which we habitually write such
expressions as
In such contexts we refer to the symbol d/dt as a differential operator.
Example 10.25
Let the operator φ be deﬁned by
φ[ f(t)] =
Then we have
φ[t2] = 2t,
φ[sin t] = cos t,
φ[4t3 −tan t] = 12t2 −sec2t,
and so on
Using this notation, a differential equation may be expressed as an operator equation.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Example 10.26
Let the operator L be deﬁned by
The differential equation
may, using the operator notation, be written as
L[ f(t)] = t4
In Section 10.3.4 we introduced the concept of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous 
linear differential equations and mentioned the convention whereby differential equa-
tions are usually written with the terms involving the dependent variable on the left-
hand side and those not involving it on the right-hand side. When written in this way,
a homogeneous equation can be characterized as an equation of the form
L[x(t)] = 0
and a nonhomogeneous one as an equation of the form
L[x(t)] = f(t)
where L is the differential operator of the equation.
10.8.2
Linear differential equations
Returning now to linear and nonlinear equations, we see that linear ones can be more
precisely and compactly deﬁned as those for which the operator satisﬁes
L[ax1 + bx2] = aL[x1] + bL[x2]
(10.36)
for all functions x1 and x2 and all constants a and b.

Hence we have

Equation (10.36) is the strict mathematical deﬁnition of linearity for any type of 
operator, and the deﬁnition we gave earlier in Section 10.3.3 is considerably less 
satisfactory mathematically. The formal deﬁnition of a linear differential equation is
therefore any differential equation whose differential operator is linear in the sense 
of (10.36).
We said before that linear differential equations are an important subcategory of 
differential equations because they have particularly useful simplifying properties. 
The most important simplifying property can be summed up in the following principle:
Linearity principle: if x1 and x2 are both solutions of the homogeneous 
linear differential equation L[x] = 0 then so is ax1 + bx2, where a and b are
arbitrary constants.
This result follows directly from the deﬁnition of a linear operator. Since x1 and x2 are
solutions of the differential equation, we have
L[x1] = 0
and
L[x2] = 0
Since the equation is linear, we have
L[ax1 + bx2] = aL[x1] + bL[x2] = 0
Therefore ax1 + bx2 is a solution of the equation L[x] = 0.
Example 10.28
We noted in Section 10.4.2 that the general solution of the equation
is
x = A sinλt + Bcosλt
This solution can be interpreted in the light of the linearity principle. Let x1 = sinλt and
x2 = cos λt. Then x1 and x2 are solutions of the differential equation. The equation is 
linear, so we know that Ax1 + Bx2 is also a solution.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Example 10.29
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
We can check, by substitution into the equation, that sin λt, cosλt, sinh λt and cosh λt
are all solutions of the equation. Therefore, since the equation is linear, the general
solution is
x = A sinλt + B cosλt + C sinhλt + D coshλt
MAPLE and MATLAB are able to solve higher-order differential equations much as
they solve ﬁrst-order differential equations. Thus, to ﬁnd the solution of the differ-
ential equation in Example 10.29 the MAPLE commands are
ode:= diff(x(t),t$4) – lambda^4*x(t);
dsolve(ode);
and, for MATLAB, the commands are
ode = ’D4x – lambda^4*x’
dsolve(ode,’t’)
In each case the general solution with 4 arbitrary constants is returned.
In Example 10.29 we have implicitly used our expectation, introduced in Section
10.4.2, that the general solution of a pth-order differential equation contains p arbitrary
constants. Since the equation is a fourth-order one, once we have found four solutions,
we assemble them with four arbitrary constants and we have the general solution. Is this
always the case? Not quite – we need an additional constraint on the solutions, as is
shown by Example 10.30.
Example 10.30
Find the general solution of the differential equation
Solution
We can show, by substituting into the equation, that et, e−t and cosh(t) are all solutions
of the differential equation. Because the equation is linear, the function
x = Aet + Be−t + C cosh(t)
is also a solution. Is it the general solution? The function cosh(t) can be written as
cosh(t) =
(et + e−t)
so the solution proposed can be rewritten as
x = Aet + Be−t +
C(et + e−t) = (A +

10.8 LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

and replacing the constants (A +
C) with D and (B +
C) with E we see that
x = Det + Ee−t
The proposed solution only really has two arbitrary constants, not the three we would
expect for the general solution. Of course if we notice that e2t is also a solution of the
differential equation we can apply the linearity principle to demonstrate that
x = Aet + Be−t + Ce2t
is a solution and, since it has the expected number of arbitrary constants and cannot be
rewritten in a form with fewer constants, it is the general solution of the differential
equation.
In order to resolve this problem, we need the idea of linear independence.
The functions f1(t), f2(t), … , fp(t) are said to be linearly dependent if a set
of numbers k1, k2, …, kp, which are not all zero, can be found such that
k1 f1(t) + k2 f2(t) + … + kp fp(t) = 0
that is,
The functions are linearly independent if no such set of numbers exists.
Example 10.31
Which of the following sets of functions are linearly dependent and which are linearly
independent?
(a) {1 + t, t, 1}
(b) {1 + t, 1 + t + t2, 1 + t2}
(c) {sin(t), cos(t)}
(d) {et, e2t, e3t}
Solution
(a) Writing f1 = 1 + t, f2 = t, f3 = 1, we seek a relationship of the form
a1 f1 + a2 f2 + a2 f2 + a3 f3 + . . . + an fn = 0
where the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an are not all zero. It is easily seen that
(1 + t) −t −1 = 0
so we have the required relationship with a1 = 1, a2 = −1, a3 = −1. Hence {1 + t, t, 1} is
a linearly dependent set of functions.
(b) Writing f1 = 1 + t, f2 = 1 + t + t2, f3 = 1 + t2, we seek a relationship of the form
a1 f1 + a2 f2 + a2 f2 + a3 f3 + . . . + an fn = 0

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
where the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an are not all zero. That is, we seek {a1, a2, a3} such that
a1(1 + t) + a2(1 + t + t2) + a3(1 + t2) = 0
Taking coefﬁcients of 1, t and t2 on both sides of the equation, we require
a1 + a2 + a3 = 0
a1 + a2 = 0
a2 + a3 = 0
that is
This is a homogeneous linear equation and we know that such equations only have a
non-zero solution if the determinant of the matrix is zero. In this case
so the only solution is 
, that is a1 = a2 = a3 = 0. Hence the functions {1 + t,  
1 + t + t2, 1 + t2} are linearly independent.
(c) We shall demonstrate that {sin(t), cos(t)} are linearly independent. We shall do this
by seeking a relationship of the form
a1f1 + a2 f2 + a2 f2 + a3 f3 + . . . + an fn = 0
We shall demonstrate that the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an must be all zero and therefore
conclude that the functions are not linearly dependent (and so are linearly independent).
In this case the relationship reduces to
a1 cos(t) + a2 sin(t) = 0
This must hold for all t in the domain of the functions. So we can choose particular 
values of t and say the relation must hold for those. Hence we have
t = 0 ⇒a11 + a20 = 0 ⇒a1 = 0
t = π/2 ⇒a10 + a21 = 0 ⇒a2 = 0
Hence the coefﬁcients must be all zero and the functions are linearly independent.
(d) This set of functions can be investigated in an analogous manner to part (c). So we
seek a relationship of the form
a1f1 + a2 f2 + a2 f2 + a3 f3 + . . . + an fn = 0
and will demonstrate that the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an must be all zero and therefore
conclude that the functions are not linearly dependent (and so are linearly independent).
In this case the relationship reduces to
a1et + a2e2t + a3e3t = 0

This must hold for all t in the domain of the functions, so we can choose particular 
values of t and say the relation must hold for those. Hence we have
t = 0 ⇒a1e0 + a2e0 + a3e0 = 0 ⇒a1 + a2 + a3 = 0
t = 1 ⇒a1e + a2e2 + a3e3 = 0
t = 2 ⇒a1e2 + a2e4 + a3e6 = 0
that is
This is a homogeneous linear equation and we know that such equations only have a
non-zero solution if the determinant of the matrix is zero. In this case
= e8 −e7 −e7 + e5 + e5 −e4 = (e4 −2e3 + 2e −1)e4 ≈1029.9
so the only solution is 
, that is a1 = a2 = a3 = 0. The coefﬁcients are all zero, 
hence the functions {et, e2t, e3t} are linearly independent.
The essential difference between a set of linearly dependent functions and a set of 
linearly independent ones is that for a linearly dependent set there are functions in the
set that can be written as linear combinations of some or all of the remaining functions.
For a linearly independent set this is not possible. We can see that the three solutions
that we ﬁrst used in Example 10.30 are linearly dependent solutions. In effect this
means that one of them is just a disguised form of the other two, and so we don’t 
really have three solutions at all, only two. The additional constraint that we mentioned 
immediately after Example 10.29 is just that the solutions must be linearly independent.
This gives us the following principle:
General solution of a linear homogeneous equation: Let L be a pth order
linear differential operator, that is
Then if x1, x2, … , xp are all solutions of the pth-order homogeneous linear
differential equation
L[x] = 0
and x1, x2, … , xp are also linearly independent then the general solution of
the differential equation is
x = A1x1 + A2x2 + … + Apxp

A formal proof of this result is not straightforward, and is not given here. We may,
however, argue for its plausibility in the following way. Since the equation is linear,
repeated application of the linearity principle shows that A1x1 + A2x2 + … + Apxp is a
solution of L[x] = 0. The expression A1x1 + A2x2 + … + Apxp has p arbitrary constants
and, since x1, x2, … , xp are linearly independent, there is no way of rewriting the expres-
sion to reduce the number of arbitrary constants. Hence A1x1 + A2x2 + … + Apxp has the
characteristics of the general solution of the differential equation.
The relatively simple structure of the general solution of a homogeneous linear 
differential equation has now been exposed. The general solution of a nonhomogeneous
equation is only slightly more complex. It is given by the following result:
General solution of a linear nonhomogeneous equation: let
L[x] = f(t)
be a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation. If x* is any solution of
this equation and xc is a solution of the equivalent homogeneous equation
L[x] = 0
then x* + xc is also a solution of the nonhomogeneous equation.
This result is relatively straightforward to prove. By deﬁnition of x* and xc, we have
L[x*] = f(t)
and
L[xc] = 0
Since L is a linear operator, we have
L[x* + xc] = L[x*] + L[xc] = f(t) + 0 = f(t)
Hence x* + xc is a solution of L[x] = f(t).
It follows from this that ﬁnding the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear 
differential equation can be reduced to the problem of ﬁnding any solution of the 
nonhomogeneous equation and adding to it the general solution of the equivalent 
homogeneous equation. The resulting expression is a solution of the nonhomogeneous
equation containing the appropriate number of arbitrary constants, and so is the general
solution. The ﬁrst part of the solution (the ‘any solution’ of the nonhomogeneous equa-
tion, x*) is known as a particular integral and the second part of the solution (the gen-
eral solution of the equivalent homogeneous equation, xc) is called the complementary
function. The reader should note the similarity in structure with the general solution of
linear recurrence relations developed in Section 7.4.

Linear nonhomogeneous differential equations present no problem to MAPLE and
MATLAB. To ﬁnd the solution of the differential equation in Example 10.33 the
MAPLE and MATLAB commands are
ode:= diff(x(t),t$2) – k^2*x(t) = sin(2*t);
dsolve(ode);
and
ode = ’D2x – k^2*x = sin(2*t)’
dsolve(ode,’t’)
respectively. It is quite instructive to precede the MAPLE commands with
infolevel[dsolve]:= 3:
to obtain a commentary from MAPLE on the sequence of methods explored to solve
this equation.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Linear constant-coefﬁcient differential equations
10.9.1
Linear homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equations
One class of linear equation that arises relatively frequently in engineering practice is
the linear constant-coefﬁcient equation. These are linear equations in which the co-
efﬁcients of the dependent variable and its derivatives do not depend on the independ-
ent variable but are constants. In view of the frequency with which such equations arise,
and the fundamental importance of the problems that give rise to such equations, it is
perhaps fortunate that they are relatively easy to solve.
We shall demonstrate the method of solution of such equations by considering, ﬁrst
of all, the second-order linear homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equation. The most
general form this can take is
a ≠0
(10.37)
Now the solution of the ﬁrst-order linear homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equation
a ≠0
is
x = Aemt,
where am + b = 0
Let us, by analogy, try the function x(t) = emt as a solution of the second-order equation
(10.37). Then direct substitution gives
am2emt + bmemt + cemt = 0
That is,
(am2 + bm + c)emt = 0
Thus emt is a solution of the equation provided that
am2 + bm + c = 0
(10.38)
Suppose the roots of this quadratic equation are m1 and m2. Then em1t and em2t are solu-
tions of the differential equation. Since it is a linear homogeneous equation, the general
solution must be
x(t) = Aem1t + Bem2t
(10.39)
provided that m1 ≠m2.
The form of the solution to (10.37) is deceptively simple. We know that the roots of
a quadratic equation will take one of three forms:
(a)
two different real numbers;
(b)
a pair of complex-conjugate numbers;
(c)
a repeated root (which must be real).

In the ﬁrst case the solution is expressed as in (10.39). In the second case the roots may
be written as
m1 = φ + jψ
and
m2 = φ −jψ
where φ and ψ are real, so that the solution is
x(t) = Ae(φ +jψ )t + Be(φ −jψ )t
= eφt(Aejψ t + Be−jψ t)
= eφt[A(cosψt + jsinψt) + B(cosψt −jsinψt)]
= eφt[(A + B)cos ψt + j(A −B)sinψt]
using Euler’s formula (3.9). Writing A + B = C and j(A −B) = D, we have
x(t) = eφt(C cosψt + D sinψt)
In the third case the two roots m1 and m2 are equal, say, to k; therefore the solution
(10.39) reduces to
x(t) = Aekt + Bekt = Cekt
In this case the two solutions are not linearly independent, so we do not yet have the
complete solution of (10.37). The complete solution, in this case, can be obtained by
using the trial solution x(t) = t pemt. In order for (10.38) to have a repeated root m = k,
the constants in (10.37) must be such that (10.37) is of the form
Substituting the trial solution into this equation gives
a[p(p −1)t p−2emt + 2mpt p−1emt + m2t pemt] −2ak(pt p−1emt + mt pemt) + ak2t pemt = 0
That is,
p(p −1) + 2mpt + m2t 2 −2k(pt + mt 2) + k 2t 2 = 0
or
p(p −1) + 2(m −k)pt + (m −k)2t 2 = 0
This equation is satisﬁed, for all values of t, if m = k and p = 1 or p = 0. Hence tekt
and ekt are two solutions of the differential equation. These are linearly independent
functions, so the general solution in the case of two equal roots is
x(t) = Atekt + Bekt = (At + B)ekt
Evidently the solutions of (10.38) that arise from substituting the trial solution into
the differential (10.37) determine the form of the solution to the latter. Equation (10.38)
is an important adjunct to the original equation, and is known as the characteristic
equation of the differential (10.37). It is sometimes referred to as the auxiliary 
equation.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Summary
To solve the second-order, linear, homogeneous, constant-coefﬁcient differential
equation
ﬁrst form the characteristic equation
am2 + bm + c = 0
and ﬁnd its roots, m1 and m2. Then if the two roots are 
l
real and distinct then the corresponding solution is
x(t) = Aem1t + Bem2t
l
both equal to k then the corresponding solution is
x(t) = (At + B)ekt
l
complex conjugates φ ± jψ then the corresponding solution is
x(t) = eφt(C cosψt + D sinψt)
Example 10.34
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
The characteristic equation is
m2 −9m + 6 = 0
The roots of this equation are m = 4.5 ± ÷57, or, to 2dp, m1 = 8.27 and m2 = 0.73. Thus
the solution is
x(t) = Ae8.27t + Be0.73t
Example 10.35
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
The characteristic equation is
2m2 −3m + 5 = 0
The roots of this equation are m =
(3 ± j÷31), or, to 2dp, m1 = 0.75 + j1.39 and
m2 = 0.75 −j1.39. Thus the solution is
x(t) = e0.75t(A cos 1.39t + B sin 1.39t)

Example 10.36
Find the solution of the initial-value problem
Solution
The characteristic equation is
m2 + 6m + 9 = (m + 3)2 = 0
This equation has a repeated root m = −3. Thus the solution is
x(t) = (At + B)e−3t
Now substituting in the initial conditions gives
B = 1,
−3B + A = 2
Hence x(t) = (5t + 1)e−3t.
Notice, in Example 10.36, that the two initial conditions allow us to determine the 
values of the two arbitrary constants in the general solution of the second-order differ-
ential equation.
We have thus far demonstrated a technique that will solve any second-order linear
homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equation. The technique extends quite satisfactorily
to higher-order homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equations. When the same trial solu-
tion emt is substituted into a pth-order equation, 
it gives rise to a characteristic equation that is a polynomial equation of degree p in m,
apm p + ap−1m p−1 + ap−2m p−2 + … + a1m + a0 = 0
We know from the theory of polynomial equations (see Section 3.1) that such an
equation has p roots. These may be real or complex, with the complex ones occurring
in conjugate pairs. The roots may also be simple or repeated. These various possibil-
ities are dealt with just as for a second-order equation. The only additional complexity
over and above the solution of the second-order equation lies in the possibility of roots
being repeated more than twice. In the case of a root m = k of multiplicity n, the 
technique employed above can be used to show that the corresponding solutions are 
ekt, tekt, t2ekt, …, tn−1ekt.
Example 10.37
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
The characteristic equation is
m3 −2m2 −5m + 6 = (m −1)(m + 2)(m −3) = 0
This equation has roots m = 1, −2, 3. Thus the solution is
x(t) = Aet + Be−2t + Ce3t

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Example 10.38
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
The characteristic equation is
2m4 + 3m3 −22m2 −73m −60 = 0
that is,
(m −4)(2m + 3)(m2 + 4m + 5) = 0
The roots are therefore m = 4, −3/2, −2 ± j. Thus the solution is
x(t) = Ae4t + Be−3t/2 + e−2t(C cos t + D sin t)
Example 10.39
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
The characteristic equation is
m4 + m3 −3m2 −5m −2 = 0
that is,
(m −2)(m3 + 3m2 + 3m + 1) = (m −2)(m + 1)3 = 0
The roots are therefore m = 2 and m = −1 repeated three times. Thus the solution is
x(t) = Ae2t + (Bt2 + Ct + D)e−t
MAPLE implements the general method which we have just developed for linear,
constant coefﬁcient, differential equations of arbitrary order (and so, by extension,
this method is also available via MATLAB). Any of the Examples 10.34–10.39 can
be solved using either package. For instance, Example 10.37 would be solved in
MAPLE and MATLAB respectively by the commands
ode:= diff(x(t),t$3) – 2*diff(x(t),t$2) 
–5*diff(x(t),t) + 6*x(t);
dsolve(ode);
and
ode = ’D3x – 2*D2x – 5*Dx + 6*x’
dsolve(ode,’t’)
The solutions of all the questions in Exercises 10.9.2 can be readily checked using
either package. For instance, Question 59(f) would be solved by

10.9.3
Linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equations
Having dealt with linear homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient differential equations, much
of the groundwork for linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient differential equations
is already covered. The general form of such an equation of pth order is
where L is a pth-order linear differential operator. We have seen in Section 10.8.2 that
the general solution of this equation takes the form of the sum of a particular integral
and the complemetary function. The complementary function is the general solution of
the equation
L[x] = 0
Hence the complementary function may be found by the methods of the last section,
and, in order to complete the treatment of the nonhomogeneous equation, we need only
to discuss the ﬁnding of the particular integral.
There is no general mathematical theory that will guarantee to produce a particular
integral by routine manipulation – rather, ﬁnding a particular integral relies on recall of
empirical rules or on intellectual inspiration. We shall proceed by ﬁrst giving some
examples.
Example 10.40
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
First we shall seek a particular integral. Try the polynomial
x(t) = Pt2 + Qt + R
Then direct substitution gives
2P + 5(2Pt + Q) −9(Pt2 + Qt + R) = t2

that is,
−9Pt2 + (10P −9Q)t + 2P + 5Q −9R = t2
Equating coefﬁcients of the various powers of t on the left- and right-hand sides of this
equation leads to a set of three linear equations for the unknown parameters P, Q and R:
−9P
= 1
10P −9Q
= 0
2P + 5Q −9R = 0
This set of equations has solution
so the particular integral is
The method of Section 10.9.1 provides the complementary function, which is
Ae−(5−÷61)t/2 + Be−(5+ ÷61)t/2
so the general solution of the equation is
Example 10.41
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
As in Example 10.40, we ﬁrst seek a particular integral. In this case the right-hand-side
function is cos2t. If we considered as a trial function x(t) = P cos2t, we should ﬁnd that
the left-hand side produced cos2t and sin2t terms. This suggests that the trial function
should be
x(t) = P cos2t + Q sin2t
Then direct substitution gives
−4P cos2t −4Q sin2t + 5(−2Psin2t + 2Q cos2t) −9(P cos2t + Q sin2t)
= cos2t
that is,
(−13P + 10Q)cos 2t −(10P + 13Q) sin 2t = cos2t
Equating coefﬁcients of cos2t and sin2t on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation
leads to two linear equations for the unknown parameters P and Q:
−13P + 10Q = 1
10P + 13Q = 0

so
and the particular integral is
x(t) =
(10sin2t −13 cos 2t)
The complementary function is the same as for Example 10.40,
Ae−(5−÷61)t/2 + Be−(5+ ÷61)t/2
so the general solution of the equation is
x(t) =
(10sin2t −13 cos 2t) + Ae−(5−÷61)t/2 + Be−(5+ ÷61)t/2
Example 10.42
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
Again we ﬁrst seek a particular integral. In this case the right-hand-side function is e4t.
Since all derivatives of e4t are multiples of e4t, the trial function Pe4t seems suitable.
Then direct substitution gives
16Pe4t + 20Pe4t −9Pe4t = e4t
Equating coefﬁcients of e4t on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation yields
27P = 1
so the particular integral is
x(t) =
e4t
The complementary function is the same as for Example 10.40,
Ae−(5−÷61)t/2 + Be−(5+ ÷61)t/2
so the general solution of the equation is
x(t) =
e4t + Ae−(5−÷61)t/2 + Be−(5+ ÷61)t/2
Examples 10.40–10.42 show how to deal with the most common right-hand-side func-
tions. In each case a trial solution function is chosen to match the right-hand-side 
function. The trial solution function contains unknown parameters, which are deter-
mined by substituting the trial solution into the differential equation and matching the
left- and right-hand sides of the equation. Figure 10.19 summarizes the standard trial
functions which are used.
Although the examples that we have shown above all involve the solution of
second-order equations, the trial solutions used to ﬁnd particular integrals that are given 
in Figure 10.19 apply to linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient differential 
equations of any order.
If the right-hand side is a linear sum of more than one of these functions then the
appropriate trial function is the sum of the trial functions for the terms making up the

right-hand side. This can be seen from the properties of linear equations expressed in
the following principle:
If L is a linear differential operator and x1 is a solution of the equation
L[x(t)] = f1(t)
and x2 is a solution of the equation
L[x(t)] = f2(t)
then x1 + x2 is a solution of the equation
L[x(t)] = f1(t) + f2(t)
This result can readily be proved as follows. Since L is a linear operator
L[x1 + x2] = L[x1] + L[x2]
= f1(t) + f2(t)
Hence x1 + x2 is a solution of L[x] = f1(t) + f2(t).

Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
First we ﬁnd the particular integral. Since the right-hand side is the sum of an exponen-
tial and a polynomial of degree one, the trial function for this equation is
Pe−2t + Q + Rt
So, by direct substitution
4Pe−2t + 5(−2Pe−2t + R) −9(Pe−2t + Q + Rt) = e−2t + 2 −t

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Equating coefﬁcients of e−2t, 1 and t on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation yields
−15P
= 1
−9Q + 5R = 2
− 9R = −1
so the particular integral is
The complementary function is the same as for Example 10.40,
Ae−(5−÷61)t/2 + Be−(5+ ÷61)t/2
so the general solution of the equation is
The solution of linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient differential equations of
order higher than two follows directly from the method for second-order equations.
Finding a particular integral is the same whatever the degree of the equation. The
principle that the solution is constructed from a particular integral added to the comple-
mentary function requires that the differential operator be linear, but is valid for an
operator of any degree. Hence completing the solution of the higher-order nonhomo-
geneous equation only requires that the derived homogeneous equation can be solved –
and we learnt how to do that in Section 10.9.1.
There is one complication that we have not yet mentioned. This is illustrated in
Example 10.44.
Example 10.44
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
Substituting in the appropriate trial solution Pe−2t produces the result 
4Pe−2t −2Pe−2t −2Pe−2t = e−2t
This equation has no solution for P.
The problem in Example 10.44 lies in the fact that the right-hand side of the equation
consists of a function that is also a solution of the equivalent homogeneous equation. 
In such cases we must multiply the appropriate trial function for the particular integral
by t. 
So, to ﬁnd the particular integral for Example 10.44, the appropriate trial solution is
Pte−2t. Substituting this into the equation we have
(−2Pe−2t + 4Pte−2t −2Pe−2t) + (−2Pte−2t + Pe−2t) −2Pte−2t = e−2t
so, gathering terms, we have
−3Pe−2t = e−2t

and the general solution to Example 10.43 is
x(t) = −te−2t + Ae−2t + Bet
If the right-hand-side function corresponds to a function that is a repeated root of the
characteristic equation then the trial function must be multiplied by t n, where n is the
multiplicity of the root of the characteristic equation.
Example 10.45
Find the general solution of the equation
Solution
Substituting in the appropriate trial solution Pet produces the result
Pet −2Pet + 5Pet −8Pet + 4Pet = et
for which, as in Example 10.44, there is no solution for P. The characteristic equation
for the homogeneous equation is
m4 −2m3 + 5m2 −8m + 4 = 0
that is,
(m −1)2(m2 + 4) = 0
so the general solution of the homogeneous equation is
x(t) = (At + B)et + C cos2t + D sin2t
The right-hand side of the equation, et, is the function corresponding to the double root
m = 1, so the standard trial function for this right-hand side, Pet, must be multiplied by
t2. Substituting this trial function, we obtain
P(t2et + 8tet + 12et) −2P(t2et + 6tet + 6et)
+ 5P(t2et + 4tet + 2et) −8P(t2et + 2tet) + 4Pt2et = et
that is,
10Pet = et
Hence the solution of the differential equation is
x(t) =
t2et + (At + B)et + C cos2t + D sin2t
Examples 10.40–10.45 have all found general solutions to problems with no boundary
conditions given. Obviously values could be determined for the constants to ﬁt the 
general solution to given boundary or initial conditions. Each boundary condition
allows the value of one constant to be ﬁxed. Hence, in general, the number of bound-
ary conditions needed to completely determine the solution is equal to the order of the
differential equation.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Again MAPLE implements the method which we have just developed for non-
homogeneous, linear, constant coefﬁcient, differential equations of arbitrary order
(and, of course, this method is therefore also available in the MATLAB Symbolic
Math Toolbox). Any of the Examples 10.40–10.45 can be solved using either pack-
age. For instance, Example 10.45 would be solved by
ode:= diff(x(t),t$4) – 2*diff(x(t),t$3) +
5*diff(x(t),t$2) – 8*diff(x(t),t) + 4*x(t) = exp(t);
sol:= dsolve(ode);
or, using MATLAB, by
ode = ’D4x – 2*D3x + 5*D2x – 8*Dx + 4*x = exp(t)’
dsolve(ode,’t’)
Solutions of any of the questions in Exercises 10.9.4 may readily be checked using
either package.

Engineering application: second-order linear
constant-coefﬁcient differential equations
In this section we are going to show how simple mathematical models of a variety of
engineering systems give rise to second-order linear constant-coefﬁcient differential
equations. We shall also investigate the major features of the solutions of such models.
10.10.1
Free oscillations of elastic systems
If a wooden plank or a metal beam is attached ﬁrmly to a rigid foundation at one end with
its other end projecting and unsupported, as shown in Figure 10.20 then the imposition
of a force on the free end, or equivalently the placing of a heavy object on it, will cause
the plank or beam to bend under the load. The greater the force or load, the greater will
be the deﬂection. If the load is moderate then the plank or beam will spring back to its
original position when the load is removed. If the load is great enough, the plank will
eventually break. The metal beam, on the other hand, may either deform permanently
(so that it does not return to its original position when the load is removed) or fracture,
depending on the type of metal. Experiments on planks or beams such as described here
have revealed that for beams made of a wide variety of materials there is commonly a
Figure 10.20

cantilever by a load.

866
INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
range of loads for which the deﬂection of the beam is roughly proportional to the load
applied (Figures 10.20(a), (b)). When the load becomes large enough, however, there
is usually a region in which the deﬂection increases either less rapidly or more rapidly
than the load (Figure 10.20(c)), and ﬁnally a load beyond which the beam either breaks
or is permanently deformed (Figure 10.20(d)).
A beam that is ﬁxed rigidly at one end and designed to support a load of some sort
on the other end is called a cantilever. There are many common everyday and engin-
eering applications of cantilevers. One with which most readers will be familiar is a 
diving springboard. Engineering applications include such things as warehouse hoists,
the wings of aircraft and some types of bridges. For most of these applications the
cantilever is designed to operate with small deﬂections; that is, the size and material of
construction of the cantilever will be chosen by the designer so that, under the greatest
anticipated load, the deﬂection of the cantilever will be small. Within this regime, the
deﬂection of the tip of the cantilever will be proportional to the load applied. In the
notation of Figure 10.20, we can write
(10.40)
where d is the deﬂection of the cantilever, F is the load applied and k is a constant.
Equation (10.40) essentially expresses a mathematical model of the cantilever, albeit a
very simple one. The model is valid for applied loads such that the deﬂection of the
cantilever remains within the linear range (where the deﬂection is proportional to load),
and would not be valid for larger loads leading to nonlinear deﬂections, permanent
distortions and breakages.
Equation (10.40) can also be used to investigate the dynamic behaviour of can-
tilevers. So far, we have assumed that the cantilever is in equilibrium under the applied
load. Such situations, in which the cantilever is not moving, are called static. The term
dynamic is conventionally used to describe situations and analyses in which the
deﬂection of the cantilever is not constant in time. When the deﬂection of a cantilever
is either greater than or less than the static deﬂection under the same load, the cantilever
exerts a net force accelerating the mass back towards its equilibrium position. As a
result, the deﬂection of the cantilever oscillates about the static equilibrium position.
The situation is illustrated in Figure 10.21.

The dynamic
behaviour of a 
loaded cantilever.

Such oscillations can be analysed fairly readily. If the mass supported on the end of
the cantilever is large compared with the mass of the cantilever itself, the effect of the
cantilever is merely to apply a force to the mass. The vertical equation of motion of the
mass is then
where x is the instantaneous deﬂection of the tip of the cantilever below the horizontal,
m is the mass and F is the upward force exerted on the mass by the cantilever due to its
bending. But the restoring force, provided the deﬂection of the cantilever remains small
enough at all times during the motion, is given by (10.40). Thus the motion is governed
by the equation
This equation, rearranged in the form
(10.41)
is recognizable as a second-order linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient equa-
tion. In the static case, when the load is not moving, the solution of this equation is 
x = mg/k. This is, of course, also a particular integral for (10.41). The complementary
function for (10.41) is
x = A cosωt + Bsinωt,
where ω 2 = k/m
The complete solution of (10.41) is therefore
+ Acosωt + B sinωt
(10.42)
The constants A and B could of course be determined if suitable initial conditions were
provided. What is at least as important −if not more so for the engineer −is to under-
stand the physical meaning of the solution (10.42). This is more easily done if (10.42)
is slightly rearranged. Taking C = (A2 + B2)1/2 and tan δ = B/A, so that 
A = C cosδ
and
B = C sinδ
(10.42) becomes
+ C cos(ωt −δ)
(10.43)
In physical terms this equation implies that the deﬂection of the cantilever takes the
form of periodic oscillations of angular frequency ω and constant amplitude C about
the position of static equilibrium of the cantilever (the position at which kx = mg).
The interested reader can check the accuracy of this description by constructing a
cantilever from a ﬂexible wooden or plastic ruler (the ﬂexible plastic type is the most
effective). The ruler should be held ﬁrmly by one end so that it projects over the edge
of a desk or table, and the free end loaded with a sufﬁcient mass of plasticine or other
suitable material. The static equilibrium position is easily found. If the end of the ruler
is displaced from this position and released, the plasticine-loaded end will be found to

vibrate up and down around the equilibrium position. If the mass of plasticine is
increased, the frequency of the vibration will be found to decrease as predicted by the
relation ω 2 = k/m.
A cantilever is not the only engineering system that gives rise to linear constant-
coefﬁcient equations. The pendulum shown in Figure 10.22 can be analysed thus. It is
of length l and carries a mass m at its free end. If the mass of the pendulum arm is very
small compared with m then, resolving forces at right-angles to the pendulum arm, the
equation of motion of the mass is
This is a second-order nonlinear differential equation, but if the displacement from the
equilibrium position (in which the pendulum hangs stationary and vertically below the
pivot) is small then sinθ  θ and the equation becomes
(10.44)
The solution of this equation is
θ = A cosωt + Bsinωt,
with ω 2 = g/l
(10.45)
In other words, the pendulum’s displacement from its equilibrium position oscillates
sinusoidally with a frequency that decreases as the pendulum increases in length but is
independent of the mass of the pendulum bob.
The buoy (or ﬂoating oil drum or similar) shown in Figure 10.23 also gives rise to a
second-order linear constant-coefﬁcient equation. Suppose the immersed depth of the
buoy is z. Its mass (which is concentrated near the bottom of the buoy in order that it
should ﬂoat upright and not tip over) is m. We know, by Archimedes’ principle, that the
water in which the buoy ﬂoats exerts an upthrust on the buoy equal to the weight of the
water displaced by the latter. If the cross-sectional area of the buoy is A and the density
of the water is ρ, the upthrust will be ρAzg. Hence the equation of motion is
that is,
(10.46)
Equation (10.46) has particular integral z = m/ρA and complementary function

so the complete solution is
(10.47)
As in the case of the cantilever, the particular integral of the equation corresponds to
the static equilibrium solution (when the buoy is ﬂoating just sufﬁciently immersed that
the upthrust exerted by the water equals the weight of the buoy), and the complement-
ary function describes oscillations of the buoy about this position. In this case the buoy
oscillates with constant amplitude and a frequency that decreases as the mass of the
buoy increases and increases as the density of the water and/or the cross-sectional area
of the buoy increases.
10.10.2
Free oscillations of damped elastic systems
Equations (10.42), (10.45) and (10.47) all describe oscillations of constant amplitude.
In reality, in all the situations described, a vibrating cantilever, an oscillating pendulum
and a bobbing buoy, experience leads us to expect that the oscillations or vibrations are of
decreasing amplitude, so that the motion eventually decays away and the system ﬁnally
comes to rest in its static equilibrium position. This suggests that the mathematical
models of the situation that we constructed in Section 10.10.1, and which are repres-
ented by (10.41), (10.44) and (10.46), are inadequate in some way.
What has been ignored in each case is the effect of dissipation of energy. Suppose, in
the case of the pendulum, the motion of the pendulum were opposed by air resistance.
The work which the pendulum does against the air resistance represents a continuous
loss of energy, as a result of which the amplitude of oscillation of the pendulum
decreases until it ﬁnally comes to rest. The situation is illustrated in Figure 10.24. 
The forces acting on the pendulum mass are gravity, air resistance (which opposes
motion) and the tension in the pendulum arm. Resolving these forces perpendicular to
the pendulum arm results in the equation of motion.
If the air resistance is assumed to be proportional to the speed of the pendulum mass
then, since the speed of the mass is l(dθ/dt), we have
Hence
or, assuming θ is small so that sin θ  θ and rearranging the terms,
(10.48)
This is a second-order linear constant-coefﬁcient differential equation. It should be
noted that the assumption that air resistance is proportional to speed is not the only 
possible assumption. For very slow-moving objects air resistance may well be more

nearly constant, while for very fast-moving objects air resistance is usually taken to 
be proportional to the square of speed, which is a much better description of reality 
for fast-moving objects. For objects moving at modest speeds, however, the assump-
tion that air resistance is proportional to speed is commonly adopted.
In the case of the cantilever and the buoy, also, we might assume that there is a 
resistance to motion that is proportional to the speed of motion. Again these are not the
only possible assumptions, but they are ones that, under appropriate circumstances, are
reasonable. The guiding principle when modelling physical systems such as these is 
to identify the physical source of the resistance and try to describe its behaviour. 
This is not a problem of mathematics but rather one of mathematical modelling, in
which engineers must use their knowledge of physics and engineering as well as of
mathematics in order to arrive at an appropriate mathematical description of reality.
Constructing models of a whole host of other engineering situations also leads to
equations similar to (10.48). Basically, any situation in which the motion of some mass
is caused by the sum of a force opposing displacement that is proportional to the dis-
placement from some ﬁxed position and a force that resists motion and is proportional
to the speed of motion gives rise to an equation of the form
that is,
(10.49)
where
We must have p  0 and q  0, because the two forces oppose displacement and
motion respectively. We know from Section 10.10.1 that the solution of (10.49) is 
x(t) = Aem1t + Bem2t
where m1 and m2 are the roots of the characteristic equation
m2 + pm + q = 0
For reasons that will become apparent, it is convenient to put (10.49) into the standard
form
(10.50)
where, because p, q  0, so are ζ and ω. The characteristic equation is then m2 + 2ζωm
+ ω 2 = 0, whose roots are

and the solution of (10.50) is therefore
x = A exp{−[ζ −(ζ 2 −1)1/2]ωt} + B exp{−[ζ + (ζ 2 −1)1/2]ωt} (ζ  1)
(10.51a)
x = e−ωt(At + B)
(ζ = 1)
(10.51b)
x = e−ζωt{A cos[(1 −ζ 2)1/2ωt] + B sin[(1 −ζ 2)1/2ωt]}
(0  ζ  1)
(10.51c)
The ﬁrst point to note about these solutions is that, since ζ  0 and ω  0, we have
x →0 as t →∞in all cases. Figure 10.25 shows the typical form of the solution (10.51)
for various values of ζ. Variation of ω will only change the scale along the horizontal
axis. For 0  ζ  1 the solution takes an oscillatory form with decaying amplitude. For
ζ  1 the solution has the form of an exponential decay. The larger ζ, the slower is the
ﬁnal decay, since the exponential coefﬁcient ζ −(ζ 2 −1)1/2 →0 as ζ →∞. In Fig-
ure 10.25 the envelopes of the oscillatory solutions are shown as broken lines. If the
envelope of the oscillatory decay is compared with the solutions for ζ  1 it is quickly
apparent that the most rapid decay is when ζ = 1. It is now apparent why we chose to
take (10.50) as the standard form for the description of second-order damped systems.
The parameter ω is the natural frequency of the system, that is, the frequency with
which it would oscillate in the absence of damping, and the parameter ζ is the damping
parameter of the system. When ζ = 1, the decay of the motion of the system to its 
equilibrium state is as fast as is possible. For this reason, ζ = 1 is referred to as critical
damping. When ζ  1, the motion described by the equation decays to its equilibrium

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
state in an oscillatory manner, passing through the equilibrium position on a number of
occasions before coming to rest. For this reason, the motion is described as under-
damped. When ζ  1, the motion described by the equation decays to the equilibrium
position in a direct manner, but less rapidly than for a critically damped system. In this
case the motion is described as over-damped.
For the under-damped case an engineering rule of thumb that is commonly used is
that when ζ = 0.3 the system shows three discernible overshoots before settling down.
That is not to say that there are only three overshoots – on the contrary, there are an
inﬁnite number – but by the fourth and subsequent overshoots the amplitude of the
oscillations has decayed to less than 2% of the initial amplitude. When ζ = 0.5, there
are two discernible overshoots (the third and subsequent ones have amplitude less than
% of initial); and when ζ = 0.7, there is only one signiﬁcant overshoot.
Another rule of thumb relates to the envelope containing the response. The response
is contained within an envelope deﬁned by the function e−ζωt. Now e−3 = 0.0498 and
e−4.5 = 0.0111; so when ζωt = 3, the amplitude of the response will have fallen to
approximately 5% of its original amplitude; and when ζωt = 4.5, it will have fallen to
roughly 1% of its original amplitude. For this reason, t = 1/ζω is called the decay time
of the system, and engineers use the rule of thumb that response falls to 5% in three
decay times and 1% in four and a half decay times.
Example 10.46
A pendulum of mass 4 kg, length 2 m and an air resistance coefﬁcient of 5 Nsm−1 is
released from an initial position in which it makes an angle of 20° with the vertical.
Assuming that this angle is small enough for the small-angle approximation to be made
in the equation of motion, how many oscillations will be obviously observable before
the pendulum comes to rest, and how long will it take for the amplitude of the motion
to have fallen to less than 1°?
Solution
The motion of the pendulum is described by (10.48). Comparing this with (10.50), 
we see that ω = (g/l)1/2 = 2.215rads−1 and 2ζω = k/m = 1.25; that is, ζ = 0.282. Hence,
since ζ  0.3, we expect to see three obvious discernible overshoots (one and a half
complete cycles of oscillation). The decay time for the pendulum is 1/ζω = 2m/k = 1.6 s,
so we expect the amplitude of oscillation of the pendulum to fall to 5% of its initial
amplitude in 4.8s.
It is evident from the preceding paragraphs and from Example 10.46 that the natural
frequency ω and the damping parameter ζ of a system are a very convenient way of
summarizing the properties of any physical system whose oscillations are described by
a damped second-order equation.
10.10.3
Forced oscillations of elastic systems
In Sections 10.10.1 and 10.10.2 we have examined the behaviour of elastic systems
undergoing oscillations in which the system is free to choose its own frequency of 
oscillation. In many situations elastic systems are driven by some external force at 
a frequency imposed by the latter.

A familiar example of such a situation is the vibration of lamp posts in strong 
winds. The lightweight tubular metal lamp posts that have frequently been installed by
highway authorities since the 1960s are a form of cantilever. The vertical post is rigidly
mounted in the ground, and carries at its top a lamp apparatus. The lamp is effectively
a concentrated mass, though it would probably not be sufﬁciently massive to allow the
assumption, which we made for the cantilevers treated in Sections 10.10.1 and 10.10.2,
that the mass of the post is small compared with the mass of the lamp. Nonetheless, if
the top of the lamp post were to be pulled to one side and released, the post would
certainly vibrate. The frequency of that vibration would be a function of the stiffness
(restoring force per unit lateral tip displacement) of the lamp post and the mass of 
both the post and the lamp apparatus carried at the top. The stiffer the lamp post, the
higher would be the frequency of vibration. The more massive the post and the lamp
apparatus, the lower the frequency.
When the wind blows past the lamp post, aerodynamic effects (known as vortex
shedding) result in an oscillating side-force on the lamp post. The frequency of this
side-force is a function of the wind speed and the diameter of the lamp post. There is
no reason why the frequency of oscillation of the wind-induced side-force should 
coincide with the frequency of the oscillations that result if the top of the lamp post 
is displaced sideways and released to vibrate freely. Under the inﬂuence of the oscil-
lating side-force, such lamp posts commonly vibrate from side to side in time with the
oscillating side-force. As the wind speed changes, so the frequency of the side-force
and therefore of the lamp post’s vibrations changes. Other types of lamp post, notably
the reinforced concrete type and the older cast-iron lamp posts, do not seem to exhibit
this behaviour. This can be explained in terms of their greater stiffness, as we shall 
see later.
Oscillations of elastic systems in which the system is free to adopt its own natural
frequency of vibration are called free vibrations, while those caused by oscillating
external forces (and in which the system must vibrate at the frequency of the external
forcing) are called forced vibrations.
Other large structures can also be forced to oscillate by the wind blowing past them,
just like lamp posts. Large modern factory chimneys made of steel or aluminium
sections bolted together and stayed by wires exhibit this type of vibration, as do the sus-
pension cables and hangers of suspension bridges and the overhead power transmission
lines of electricity grid systems. The legs of offshore oil rigs can be forced to vibrate
by ocean currents and waves. The wings of an aircraft (which, being mounted rigidly
in the fuselage of the aircraft, are also a form of cantilever) may vibrate under aero-
dynamic loads, particularly from atmospheric turbulence. Large pieces of static industrial
machinery are usually bolted down to the ground. If such fastening is subjected to a
large load, it will usually give a little, so the attachment of the machinery to the ﬂoor
must be considered as elastic. If the machinery, when in operation, produces an inter-
nal side-load (such as an out-of-balance rotor would produce) then the machinery is
seen to rock from side to side on its mountings at the frequency of the internally gen-
erated side-loading. This effect can often be observed in the rocking vibrations of a car
engine when it is idling in a stationary car. It is well known that bodies of men or
women marching are ordered to break step when passing over bridges. If they did not,
the regular footfalls of the whole group would create a periodic force on the bridge. The
dangers of such regular forces will become apparent in our analysis. All these situations
are similar in nature to the forced vibrations of the lamp post under the inﬂuence of 
the wind. In most of them the oscillations induced by the side-force are potentially 
10.10 ENGINEERING APPLICATION
873

disastrous, and must be understood by the engineer so that engineering artefacts may be
designed to avoid the destructive effects of forced vibrations.
A simple model of the vibrations of a lamp post can be constructed as shown in
Figure 10.26. The lamp apparatus, of mass m, is displaced from its equilibrium position
by a distance x. The structure of the cantilever results in a restoring force S and air
resistance in a restoring force R. The wind load (which, remember, is not a force in the
direction of the wind but rather an oscillatory side-force) is W. If the displacement x is
small and the displacement velocity is not too great then we may reasonably assume
S = kx
and
Making the somewhat unrealistic assumption that the mass of the lamp post itself is
small compared with the mass of the lamp apparatus, the equation of motion of the
lamp is seen to be
The wind-induced force W is oscillatory, so we shall assume that it is of the form
W = W0 cosΩt
Hence the equation of motion becomes
(10.52)
which is a second-order linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient differential equation.
In order to facilitate the interpretation of the result, we shall replace (10.52) with the
equivalent equation
(10.53)
The particular integral for (10.53) is obtained by assuming the form A cosΩt + B sin Ωt,
and is found to be
(10.54a)
or equivalently
(10.54b)
where
The complementary function is of course the solution of the homogeneous equival-
ent of (10.52), which is just (10.50). The complementary function is therefore given by
(10.51). The motion of a damped second-order system in response to forcing by a force

F cosΩt is therefore the sum of (10.51) and (10.54a) or (10.54b). In Section 10.10.2 we
saw that (10.51) is, for positive ζ, always a decaying function of time. The comple-
mentary function for (10.53) therefore represents a motion that decays to nothing with
time, and is therefore called a transient solution. The particular integral, on the other
hand, does not decay, but continues at a steady amplitude for as long as the forcing
remains. The long-term response of a damped second-order system to forcing by a force
F cos Ωt is therefore to oscillate at the forcing frequency Ωwith amplitude
(10.55)
times the amplitude of the forcing term. This is called the steady-state response
of the system. Evidently, the amplitude of the steady-state response changes as the
frequency Ωof the forcing changes. In Figure 10.27 the form of the response amplitude
A(Ω) as a function of Ωis shown for a range of values of ζ. Obviously, the character-
istics of the response of a damped second-order system to forcing depend crucially on
the damping. For lightly damped systems (ζ near to 0) the response has a deﬁnite maxi-
mum near to ω, the natural frequency of the system. For more heavily damped systems
the peak response is smaller, and for large enough ζ the peak disappears altogether.
The signiﬁcance of this is that systems subjected to an oscillatory external force at a
frequency near to the natural frequency of the system will, unless they are sufﬁciently
heavily damped, respond with large-amplitude motion. This phenomenon is known as
resonance. Resonance can cause catastrophic failure of the structure of a system. The
history of engineering endeavour contains many examples of structures that have failed
because they have been subjected to some external exciting force with a frequency near
to one of the natural frequencies of vibration of the structure. Perhaps the most famous
example of such a failure is the collapse in 1941 of the suspension bridge at Tacoma
Narrows in the USA. This failure, due to wind-induced oscillations, was recorded on
ﬁlm and provides a salutary lesson for all engineers. Similar forces have destroyed 
factory chimneys, power transmission lines and aircraft.

It should now be obvious why the amplitude of oscillation of the tubular metal lamp
post varies with wind speed. The natural frequency of the lamp post is determined by
its structure, and is therefore ﬁxed. The frequency of the vortex shedding, and so of 
the oscillatory side-force, is directly proportional to the wind speed. Hence, as the 
wind speed increases, so does the frequency of external forcing of the lamp post. As the
forcing frequency approaches the natural frequency of the lamp post, the amplitude 
of the lamp post’s vibrations increases. When the wind speed increases sufﬁciently, the
forcing frequency exceeds the natural frequency, and the amplitude of the oscillations
decreases again. The same explanation applies to the Tacoma Narrows bridge. The
bridge, once constructed, stood for some months without serious difﬁculty. The failure
was the result of the ﬁrst storm in which wind speeds rose sufﬁciently to excite the
bridge structure at one of its natural frequencies. (Since the structure of a suspension
bridge is much more complex than that of a simple cantilever, such a bridge has many
natural frequencies, corresponding to different modes of vibration.)
10.10.4
Oscillations in electrical circuits
In Section 10.2.4 we analysed a simple electrical circuit composed of a resistor, a
capacitor and an inductor. In that case we considered what happened when a switch 
was thrown in a circuit containing a d.c. voltage source. If an alternating voltage signal
is applied to a similar circuit the equation governing the resulting oscillations also turns
out to be a second-order linear differential equation.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.28. Suppose a voltage Vi is applied across
the input terminals i1 and i2. The voltage drop across the inductor is L(di/dt), that across
the capacitor is (i/C)dt and that across the resistor is Ri. Kirchhoff’s laws (or the prin-
ciple of conservation of charge) tell us that the current in each component must be the
same. The voltage across the output terminals o1 and o2 is (i/C)dt = Vo. Hence we have
with
That is,
or
(10.56)
This is a second-order linear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient differential equa-
tion. If the signal Vi is of the form V cosΩt then we essentially have forced oscillations
of a second-order system again. If we write

then (10.56) takes the standard form of (10.53), and we can infer that the voltage Vo will
be sinusoidal with amplitude
where
Thus when a sinusoidal voltage waveform is applied to the input terminals of the
circuit, the voltage appearing at the output terminals is also a sinusoidal waveform,
but one whose amplitude, relative to the input waveform amplitude, depends on the
frequency of the input. A circuit that has this property is of course called a ﬁlter.
The form of A(Ω) will depend on ω and ζ, which in turn are determined by the 
values of L, R and C. The latter could be chosen so that ζ is small. In that case the 
circuit provides a large output when the input frequency Ωis near some frequency ω
(which is determined by the choice of L and C) and a smaller output otherwise. This is
a tuned circuit or a bandpass ﬁlter. If L, R and C are chosen so that ζ is larger (say
near unity) then the circuit provides a larger output for small Ωand a smaller output for
larger Ω. Such a circuit is a low-pass ﬁlter.
In this section, we have seen how problems in two very different areas of engineering
– one mechanical and the other electrical – both give rise to very similar equations. Our
knowledge of the form of the solutions of the equation is applicable to either area. 
This is a good example of the unifying properties of mathematics in engineering science.
There are many other applications of the theory of the solution of second-order linear
constant-coefﬁcient differential equations in engineering.
It is also worth commenting here that ﬁlters of the type that we have described 
in this section are called passive ﬁlters since they use only inductors, resistors and
capacitors – components that are referred to as passive components. Modern practice
in electrical engineering involves the use of active components such as operational
ampliﬁers in ﬁlter design, such ﬁlters being known as active ﬁlters. The analysis of the
operation of active ﬁlters is more complex than that of passive ﬁlters. While, for many
applications, active ﬁlters have displaced passive ﬁlters in modern practice, there are
also many applications in which passive ﬁlters remain the norm.

The function A(Ω) is as given by (10.55) and
shown in Figure 10.27. Show that A(Ω) has a
simple maximum point when ζ  ÷ . Let the
value of Ωfor which this maximum occurs be
Ωmax. Find Ωmax as a function of ζ and ω, and 
also ﬁnd A(Ωmax).
For ζ  ÷ , A(Ω) has no maximum, but does
have a single point of inﬂection. Show, by
consideration of Figure 10.27, that |dA/dΩ| is a
maximum at the point of inﬂection. Let Ωc be the

occurs. Show that Ωc satisﬁes the equation

where β = 2ζ 2 −1. Hence show that for ζ = ÷
the greatest value of | dA/dΩ| occurs when Ω= ω
and is 1/(÷2ω 3). Also ﬁnd the greatest values of

ζ = ÷ . The two values of ζ that minimize the
maxima of |dA/dΩ| and | d2A(0)/dΩ2| respectively
are important, particularly in control theory, since,
in different senses, they maximize the ﬂatness of 
the response function A(Ω).

An underwater sensor is mounted below the keel 
of the fast patrol boat shown in Figure 10.29. The
supporting bracket is of cylindrical cross-section
(diameter 0.04m), and so is subject to an oscillating
side-force due to vortex shedding. The bracket is 
of negligible mass compared with the sensor itself,
which has a mass of 4kg. The bracket has a tip
displacement stiffness of 25000Nm−1. The
frequency of the oscillating side-force is SU/d,
where U is the speed of the vessel through the
water, d is the diameter of the supporting bracket
and S is the Strouhal number for vortex shedding
from a circular cylinder. S has the value 0.20
approximately. At what speed will the frequency of
the side-force coincide with the natural frequency 
of the sensor and mounting?

Numerical solution of second- and higher-order
differential equations
Obviously, the classes of second- and higher-order differential equations that can be
solved analytically, while representing an important subset of the totality of such
equations, are relatively restricted. Just as for ﬁrst-order equations, those for which 
no analytical solution exists can still be solved by numerical means. The numerical
solution of second- and higher-order equations does not, in fact, need any signiﬁcant
new mathematical theory or technique.
10.11.1
Numerical solution of coupled ﬁrst-order equations
In Section 10.6 we met Euler’s method for the numerical solution of equations of the
form
that is, ﬁrst-order differential equations involving a single dependent variable and a
single independent variable. In Section 10.3 we noted that it was possible to have sets
of coupled ﬁrst-order equations, each involving the same independent variable but with
more than one dependent variable. An example of this type of equation set is

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
(10.57a)
(10.57b)
This is a pair of differential equations in the dependent variables x and y with the inde-
pendent variable t. The derivative of each of the dependent variables depends not only
on itself and on the independent variable t, but also on the other dependent variable.
Neither of the equations can be solved in isolation or independently of the other – both
must be solved simultaneously, or side by side. A pair of coupled differential equations
such as (10.57) may be characterized as
(10.58a)
(10.58b)
For a set of p such equations it is convenient to denote the dependent variables not 
by x, y, z, … but by x1, x2, x3, …, xp and to denote the set of equations by
= fi(t, x1, x2, … , xp)
(i = 1, 2, … , p)
or equivalently, using vector notation,
where x(t) is a vector function of t given by
x(t) = [x1(t)
x2(t)
…
xp(t)]T
f(t, x) is a vector-valued function of the scalar variable t and the vector variable x. 
Euler’s method for the solution of a single differential equation takes the form
Xn+1 = Xn + hf(tn, Xn)
If we were to try to apply this method to (10.58a), we should obtain
Xn+1 = Xn + hf1(tn, Xn, Yn)
In other words, the value of Xn+1 depends not only on tn and Xn but also on Yn. In the
same way, we would obtain
Yn+1 = Yn + hf2(tn, Xn, Yn)
for Yn+1. In practice, this means that to solve two coupled differential equations, we
must advance the solution of both equations simultaneously in the manner shown in
Example 10.47.

10.11 NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF SECOND- AND HIGHER-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Example 10.47
Find the value of X(1.4) satisfying the following initial-value problem:
= x −y2 + xt,
x(1) = 0.5
= 2x2 + xy −t,
y(1) = 1.2
using Euler’s method with time step h = 0.1.
Solution
The right-hand sides of the two equations will be denoted by f1(t, x, y) and f2(t, x, y)
respectively, so
f1(t, x, y) = x −y2 + xt
and
f2(t, x, y) = 2x2 + xy −t
The initial condition is imposed at t = 1, so tn will denote 1 + nh, Xn will denote
X(1 + nh), and Yn will denote Y(1 + nh). Then we have
X1 = x0 + hf1(t0, x0, y0)
Y1 = y0 + hf2(t0, x0, y0)
= 0.5 + 0.1f1(1, 0.5, 1.2)
= 1.2 + 0.1f2(1, 0.5, 1.2)
= 0.4560
= 1.2100
for the ﬁrst step. The next step is therefore
X2 = X1 + hf1(t1, X1, Y1)
Y2 = Y1 + hf2(t1, X1, Y1)
= 0.4560
= 1.2100
+ 0.1f1(1.1, 0.4560, 1.2100)
+ 0.1f2(1.1, 0.4560, 1.2100)
= 0.4054
= 1.1968
and the third step is
X3 = 0.4054
Y3 = 1.1968
+ 0.1f1(1.2, 0.4054, 1.1968)
+ 0.1f2(1.2, 0.4054, 1.1968)
= 0.3513
= 1.1581
Finally, we obtain
X4 = 0.3513 + 0.1f1(1.3, 0.3513, 1.1581) 
= 0.2980
Hence we have X(1.4) = 0.2980.
It should be obvious from Example 10.47 that the main drawback of extending Euler’s
method to sets of differential equations is the additional labour and tedium of the 
computations. Intrinsically, the computations are no more difﬁcult, merely much more
laborious – a prime example of a problem ripe for computerization.

INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
10.11.2
State-space representation of higher-order systems
The solution of differential equation initial-value problems of order greater than one
can be reduced to the solution of a set of ﬁrst-order differential equations. This is
achieved by a simple transformation, illustrated by Example 10.48.
Example 10.48
The initial-value problem
can be transformed into two coupled ﬁrst-order differential equations by introducing an
additional variable
With this deﬁnition, we have
and so the differential equation becomes
+ x 2ty −xt 2 =
t 2
Thus the original differential equation can be replaced by a pair of coupled ﬁrst-order
differential equations, together with initial conditions:
= y,
x(0) = 1.2
= −x2ty + xt 2 +
t 2,
y(0) = 0.8
This process can be extended to transform a pth-order initial-value problem into a set
of p ﬁrst-order equations, each with an initial condition. Once the original equation has
been transformed in this way, its solution by numerical methods is just the same as if it
had been a set of coupled equations in the ﬁrst place.
Example 10.49
Find the value of X(0.2) satisfying the initial-value problem
using Euler’s method with step size h = 0.05.

10.11 NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF SECOND- AND HIGHER-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
883
Solution
Since this is a third-order equation, we need to introduce two new variables:
Then the equation is transformed into a set of three ﬁrst-order differential equations
= y
x(0) = 1
= z
y(0) = 0.5
= −xtz −ty + t 2x
z(0) = −0.2
Applied to the set of differential equations
= f1(t, x, y, z)
= f2(t, x, y, z)
= f3(t, x, y, z)
the Euler scheme is of the form
Xn+1 = Xn + hf1(tn, Xn, Yn, Zn)
Yn+1 = Yn + hf2(tn, Xn, Yn, Zn)
Zn+1 = Zn + hf3(tn, Xn, Yn, Zn)
In this case, therefore, we have
X0 = x0 = 1
Y0 = y0 = 0.5
Z0 = z0 = −0.2
f1(t0, X0, Y0, Z0) = Y0 = 0.5000
f2(t0, X0, Y0, Z0) = Z0 = −0.2000
f3(t0, X0, Y0, Z0) = −X0t0Z0 −t0Y0 + t 2
0 X0
= −1.0000 × 0 × (−0.2000) −0 × 0.5000 + 02 × 1.0000
= 0.0000
X1 = 1.0000 + 0.05 × 0.5000 = 1.0250
Y1 = 0.5000 + 0.05 × (−0.2000) = 0.4900
Z1 = −0.2000 + 0.05 × 0.0000 = −0.2000
f1(t1, X1, Y1, Z1) = Y1 = 0.4900

f2(t1, X1, Y1, Z1) = Z1 = −0.2000
f3(t1, X1, Y1, Z1) = −X1t1Z1 −t1Y1 + t 2
1X1
= −1.0250 × 0.05 × (−0.2000) −0.05 × 0.4900
+ 0.052 × 1.0250 = −0.0117
X2 = 1.0250 + 0.05 × 0.4900 = 1.0495
Y2 = 0.4900 + 0.05 × (−0.2000) = 0.4800
Z2 = −0.2000 + 0.05 × (−0.0117) = −0.2005
Proceeding similarly we have
X3 = 1.0495 + 0.05 × 0.4800 = 1.0735
Y3 = 0.4800 + 0.05 × (−0.2005) = 0.4700
Z3 = −0.2005 + 0.05 × (−0.0165) = −0.2013
X4 = 1.0735 + 0.05 × 0.4700 = 1.0970
Y4 = 0.4700 + 0.05 × (−0.2013) = 0.4599
Z4 = −0.2013 + 0.05 × (−0.0139) = −0.2018
Hence X(0.2) = X4 = 1.0970. It should be obvious by now that computations like these
are sufﬁciently tedious to justify the effort of writing a computer program to carry out
the actual arithmetic. The essential point for the reader to grasp is not the mechanics 
but the principle whereby methods for the solution of ﬁrst-order differential equations
(and this includes the more sophisticated methods as well as Euler’s method) can be
extended to the solution of sets of equations and hence to higher-order equations.
We noted earlier that both MAPLE and MATLAB can be used to obtain numerical
solutions of differential equations and commented that they both implement very
accurate methods of solution which are much more sophisticated than the Euler
method illustrated here. But MAPLE could be used to obtain an Euler method 
solution of the third-order differential equation in Example 10.49, as follows:
ode:= diff(x(t),t$3) + x(t)*t*diff(x(t),t$2) +
t*diff(x(t),t) – x(t)*t^2 = 0:
odeprob:= {ode,x(0) = 1,D(x)(0) = 0.5,D(D(x))(0) =
–0.2};
oseq:= array([seq(0.05*i,i = 0..4)]);
oput:= dsolve(odeprob,numeric, 
method = classical[foreuler], 
output = oseq,stepsize = 0.05):
evalm(oput[2,1]);
884
INTRODUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

10.11 NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF SECOND- AND HIGHER-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
885
MAPLE is equally able to solve the same equation presented in state space form,
thus
ode1:= diff(x(t),t) = y(t):
ode2:= diff(y(t),t) = z(t):
ode3:= diff(z(t),t) = –x(t)*t*z(t) – t*y(t) + x(t)*t^2:
odeprob:= {ode1,ode2,ode3,x(0) = 1,y(0) = 0.5,z(0) =
–0.2};
oseq:= array([seq(0.05*i,i = 0..4)]);
oput:= dsolve(odeprob,numeric,
method = classical[foreuler], 
output = oseq,stepsize = 0.05):
evalm(oput[2,1]);
In fact, if we set the infolevel system variable thus
infolevel[dsolve]:= 3:
before calling dsolve to integrate the differential equation in the third-order form
above, we discover that MAPLE ﬁrst translates it into state space form just as we
have done in Example 10.49!

A water treatment plant deals with a constant inﬂux
Q of polluted water with pollutant concentration
s0. The treatment tank contains bacteria which
consume the pollutant and protozoa which feed
on the bacteria, thus keeping the bacteria from
increasing too rapidly and overwhelming the
system. If the concentration of the bacteria and 
the protozoa are denoted by b and p the system 
is governed by the differential equations
Write a program to solve these equations
numerically. 
Measurements have determined that the
(biological) parameters α, m, β and n have the
values 0.5, 1.0, 0.8 and 0.1 respectively. The
parameter r is a measure of the inﬂow rate of
polluted water and s0 is the level of pollutant. 
Using the initial conditions s(0) = 0, b(0) = 0.2 
and p(0) = 0.05 determine the ﬁnal steady level

The values of X(0.4) using step sizes of 0.01 and 0.005 are found to be 0.398022
and 0.397919 to 6sf respectively. This enables us to predict, using Richardson

extrapolation, that a step size of approximately h = 0.0024 or smaller would be
required to obtain the speciﬁed accuracy. In fact, as we have already noted, the
MAPLE dsolve/numeric procedure can integrate differential equations numeric-
ally using much more sophisticated methods and providing answers to a speciﬁed
accuracy. The dsolve/numeric procedure uses methods similar to the Richardson
extrapolation method to achieve this.
10.12
Qualitative analysis of second-order 
differential equations
Sometimes it is easier or more convenient to discover the qualitative properties of the
solutions of a differential equation than to solve it completely. In some cases this quali-
tative knowledge is just as useful as a complete solution. In other cases the qualitative
knowledge is more illuminating than a quantitative solution, particularly if the only
quantitative solutions that can be derived are numerical ones. One technique that is very
useful in this context is the phase-plane plot.
10.12.1
Phase-plane plots
The second-order nonlinear differential equation
is known as the Van der Pol oscillator. It has properties that are typical of many non-
linear oscillators. The equation has no simple analytical solution, so, if we wish to
investigate its properties, we must resort to a numerical computation. The equation 
can readily be recast in state-space form as described in Section 10.11.2 and solved 
by Euler’s method described in Section 10.6.
Figure 10.32 shows displacement and velocity plots for a Van der Pol oscillator with
λ = 40 and µ = 3. The initial conditions used were x(0) = 0.05 and (dx/dt)(0) = 0. 
It can be seen that initially the amplitude of the displacement oscillations grows quite
rapidly, but after about three cycles this rapid growth stops and the displacement 
curve appears to settle into a periodically repeating pattern. Similar comments could be
made about the velocity curve. Is the Van der Pol oscillator tending towards some ﬁxed
cyclical pattern?
This question can be answered much more easily if the displacement and velocity
curves are plotted in a different way. Instead of plotting each individually against time,
we plot velocity against displacement, as in Figure 10.33. Such a plot is called a phase-
plane plot. Figure 10.33(a) shows the same data as plotted in Figure 10.32. Time
increases in the direction shown by the arrows, the plot starting at the point (0.05, 0)
and spiralling outwards. From this plot it is easy to see that the fourth and ﬁfth cycles
of the oscillations are nearly indistinguishable. Continuing the computations for a larger
number of cycles would conﬁrm that, after an initial period, the oscillations settle down
into a cyclical pattern. The pattern is called a limit cycle. The Van der Pol oscillator has
the property that the limit cycle is independent of the initial conditions chosen (but

depends on the parameters µ and λ). Figure 10.33(b) shows a phase-plane plot of the
oscillations of the Van der Pol oscillator, starting from the initial condition (4.5, 0). The
interested reader may wish to explore the Van der Pol oscillator further – perhaps 
by writing a computer program to solve the equation and plotting solution paths in
the phase plane for a number of other initial conditions. Exploration of this type will
conﬁrm that the limit cycle is independent of initial conditions, and exploration of other
values of µ and λ will show how the limit cycle varies as these parameters change.
Other equations will of course produce different solution paths in the phase plane.
The second-order linear constant-coefﬁcient equation
yields a phase-plane plot like that shown in Figure 10.34(a). In that particular case the
parameters have the values µ = 1.5 and λ = 40. Other values of µ and λ that result

in decaying oscillatory solutions of the equation yield similar spiral phase-plane plots
tending towards the origin as t →∞. Such a plot is typical of any system whose
behaviour is oscillatory and decaying. For instance, Figure 10.34(b) shows the phase-
plane plot of the nonlinear second-order equation
(10.59)
with µ = 3 and λ = 40 (recall that the function sgn(x) takes the value 1 if x  0 and 
−1 if x  0). The general characters of Figures 10.34(a), (b) are similar. The difference
between the two equations is manifest in the difference between the pattern of changing
spacing of successive turns of the spirals.
The utility of phase-plane plotting is not restricted to enhancing the understanding
of numerical solutions of differential equations. Second-order differential equations
which can be expressed in the form
arise in mathematical models of many engineering systems. An equation of this form
can be expressed as
The derivative dv/dx is of course just the gradient of the solution path in the phase
plane. Hence we can sketch the path in the phase plane of the solutions of a second-
order differential equation of this type without actually obtaining the solution. This
provides a useful qualitative insight into the form of solution that might be expected.
As an example, consider (10.59). This may be expressed as

Figure 10.35
The phase-plane
direction ﬁeld 
for (10.59).
Thus the gradient of the solution path in the phase plane is equal to k for all points on
the curve
These curves are of course a family of straight lines. Hence we can construct a diagram
similar to the direction-ﬁeld diagrams described in Section 10.5.1. The phase-plane
direction-ﬁeld diagram is shown, with the solution path from Figure 10.34(b) super-
imposed upon it, in Figure 10.35.
This technique can also be used for equations for which the lines of constant gradient
in the phase plane are not straight. Example 10.50 illustrates this.
MAPLE provides tools to assist in the construction of phase-plane plots. One such
tool is the phaseportrait procedure. The following MAPLE commands produce
a diagram similar to Figure 10.33(a) but with a direction ﬁeld shown in addition to
the solution curve.
with(DEtools):
vdp2:= {diff(x(t),t) = v(t),
diff(v(t),t) = –3*(x(t)^2 – 1)*v(t) – 40*x(t)};
phaseportrait(vdp2,{x(t),v(t)},t = 0..10,
[[x(0) = 0.05,v(0) = 0]],x = –2..2,stepsize = 0.01);
Notice that it is necessary to load the DEtools package in order to access the
phaseportrait procedure. Also the second-order differential equation is con-
verted into a state space form for use in phaseportrait.
The phaseportrait procedure can be used to produce a diagram similar to
Figure 10.36 for Example 10.50, and also to check your solutions to all parts of
Question 78.

Example 10.50
Draw a phase-plane direction ﬁeld for the equation
(10.60)
Hence sketch the solution path of the equation that starts from the initial conditions
x = 1, dx/dt = 0.
Solution
Equation (10.60) can be expressed as
so the curve on which the solution-path gradient is equal to k is given by
x = −
(kv + 1.5v3)
Thus, as shown in Figure 10.36, the curves of constant solution-path gradient are in this
case cubic functions of v. The solution path of the equation starting from the point 
(1, 0) is sketched.

Equation (10.3), arising from the model of the 
take-off run of an aircraft developed in Section
10.2.1, can be solved by the techniques introduced
in Exercises 24 and 26. Assuming that the thrust 
is constant ﬁnd the speed of the aircraft both 
as a function of time and of distance run along 
the ground. The take-off speed of the aircraft is 
denoted by V2. Find expressions for the length of
runway required and the time taken by the aircraft 
to become airborne in terms of take-off speed.

the solution of the differential equation problem
using Euler’s method with step size h = 0.025.
Repeat the computation with h = 0.0125. Hence 
estimate the accuracy of the value of X(2) given 
by your solution.

The end of a chain, coiled near the edge of a
horizontal surface, falls over the edge. If the
friction between the chain and the horizontal
surface is negligible and the chain is inextensible
then, when a length x of chain has fallen, the
equation of motion is 
where m is the mass per unit length of the chain, 
g is gravitational acceleration and v is the velocity
of the falling length of the chain. If the mass per
unit length of the chain is constant show that this
equation can be expressed as
and, by putting y = v2, show that v = ÷(2gx/3).

damping, is vibrating under the action of a

where F and p are constants.
Solve the differential equation for the
displacement x(t). Show that one part of the
solution tends to zero as t →∞and show that
the amplitude of the steady-state solution is
F[(4 −p2)2 + 4p2]−1/2.
Hence show that resonance occurs when p = ÷2.

An alternating emf of E sinωt volt is supplied 
to a circuit containing an inductor of L henry, a
resistor of R ohm and a capacitor of C farad in
series. The differential equation satisﬁed by the
current i amp and the charge q coulomb on the
capacitor is
Using i = dq/dt obtain a second-order differential
equation satisﬁed by i. Find the resistance if it is
just large enough to prevent natural oscillations.
For this value of R and ω = (LC)−1/2 prove that
where K 2 = L/C, when the current and charge on
the capacitor are both zero at time t = 0.
The following three questions are intended to be open-
ended – there is no single ‘correct’ answer. They should
be approached in an enquiring frame of mind, with the
objective of discovering, by use of mathematical
knowledge and technique, something more about how 
the physical world functions. The questions are designed
to use primarily mathematical knowledge introduced in
this chapter.

Repeat these calculations for similar trucks subject
to resistance forces proportional to
(a) square root of speed;
(b) square of speed;
(c) cube of speed.
How long does the truck take to come to rest in 
each case? Draw plots of velocity against
displacement in each case. Explain, in qualitative
terms, the behaviour of the truck under each type 
of resistance. 
How would you model mathematically a truck
that is subject to a small constant resistance plus 
a resistance proportional to its speed? How far
would such a truck travel before coming to rest, 
and how long would it take to do so? Can you
repeat these calculations for trucks subject to a 
small constant resistance plus a resistance
proportional to speed squared or speed cubed?
What general conclusions can you draw about
the type of terms that it is sensible to use in
mathematical models of engineering systems to
describe resistance to motion?

Figure 10.37 shows a system that serves as a
simpliﬁed model of the phenomenon of ‘tool
chatter’. The mass A rests on a moving belt and 
is connected to a rigid support by a spring. The
coefﬁcient of sliding friction between the belt 
and the mass is less than the coefﬁcient of static
friction. When the spring is uncompressed, the 
mass moves to the right with the belt. As it does
so, the spring is compressed until the force 
exerted by the spring exceeds the maximum static
frictional force available. The mass then starts to
slide. The spring force slows the mass, brings it

‘tool chatter’ phenomenon.

to rest, and then accelerates it back along the 
belt so that it moves leftwards. As it does so, the
compression in the spring is reduced, the force of
sliding friction slows the mass to rest, and then
accelerates it so that its velocity is directed to 
the right. When its velocity matches that of the
belt, sliding ceases and static friction takes 
over again. 
Thus the mass undergoes a cyclic process of
being pushed forwards by static friction until the
spring is sufﬁciently compressed and then being
ﬂung backwards by the stored energy in the spring
until the energy is dissipated. Analyse the model,
determining such quantities as how the amplitude
and frequency of motion of the mass depend on
the coefﬁcients and static friction and the other
physical parameters.

The second-order linear nonhomogeneous
constant-coefﬁcient differential equation
(often referred to as a forced harmonic oscillator)
has a response A(Ω)F cos(Ωt −δ ), where A(Ω) is
often called the frequency response (strictly it is
the amplitude response or gain spectrum) and is
given by (10.55) and shown in Figure 10.27. How
does the frequency response of the second-order
nonlinear nonhomogeneous constant-coefﬁcient
differential equation
differ from that of the linear one?

11.1
Introduction
Laplace transform methods have a key role to play in the modern approach to the 
analysis and design of engineering systems. The stimulus for developing these methods
was the pioneering work of the English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925)
in developing a method for the systematic solution of ordinary differential equations
with constant coefﬁcients. Heaviside was concerned with solving practical problems,
and his method was based mainly on intuition, lacking mathematical rigour: con-
sequently it was frowned upon by theoreticians at the time. However, Heaviside 
himself was not concerned with rigorous proofs, and was satisﬁed that his method gave
the correct results. Using his ideas, he was able to solve important practical problems
that could not be dealt with using classical methods. This led to many new results in
ﬁelds such as the propagation of currents and voltages along transmission lines.
Because it worked in practice, Heaviside’s method was widely accepted by engin-
eers. As its power for problem-solving became more and more apparent, the method
attracted the attention of mathematicians, who set out to justify it. This provided the
stimulus for rapid developments in many branches of mathematics, including improper
integrals, asymptotic series and transform theory. Research on the problem continued
for many years before it was eventually recognized that an integral transform developed
by the French mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749–1827) almost a century
before provided a theoretical foundation for Heaviside’s work. It was also recognized
that the use of this integral transform provided a more systematic alternative for 
investigating differential equations than the method proposed by Heaviside. It is this
alternative approach that is the basis of the Laplace transform method.
We have already come across instances where a mathematical transformation has
been used to simplify the solution of a problem. For example, the logarithm is used 
to simplify multiplication and division problems. To multiply or divide two numbers,
we transform them into their logarithms, add or subtract these, and then perform the
inverse transformation (that is, the antilogarithm) to obtain the product or quotient of
the original numbers. The purpose of using a transformation is to create a new domain
in which it is easier to handle the problem being investigated. Once results have been
obtained in the new domain, they can be inverse-transformed to give the desired results
in the original domain.
The Laplace transform is an example of a class called integral transforms, and it
takes a function f(t) of one variable t (which we shall refer to as time) into a function
F(s) of another variable s (the complex frequency). Another integral transform widely
used by engineers is the Fourier transform, which is dealt with in the companion text
Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics. The attraction of the Laplace transform
is that it transforms differential equations in the t (time) domain into algebraic equa-
tions in the s (frequency) domain. Solving differential equations in the t domain there-
fore reduces to solving algebraic equations in the s domain. Having done the latter for
the desired unknowns, their values as functions of time may be found by taking inverse
transforms. Another advantage of using the Laplace transform for solving differential
equations is that initial conditions play an essential role in the transformation process, so
they are automatically incorporated into the solution. This constrasts with the classical
approach considered in Chapter 10, where the initial conditions are only introduced
when the unknown constants of integration are determined. The Laplace transform is

therefore an ideal tool for solving initial-value problems such as those occurring in the
investigation of electrical circuits and mechanical vibrations.
The Laplace transform ﬁnds particular application in the ﬁeld of signals and linear
systems analysis. A distinguishing feature of a system is that when it is subjected to an
excitation (input), it produces a response (output). When the input u(t) and output x(t)
are functions of a single variable t, representing time, it is normal to refer to them as
signals. Schematically, a system may be represented as in Figure 11.1. The problem
facing the engineer is that of determining the system output x(t) when it is subjected to
an input u(t) applied at some instant of time, which we can take to be t = 0. The rela-
tionship between output and input is determined by the laws governing the behaviour
of the system. If the system is linear and time-invariant then the output is related to the
input by a linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients, and we have a standard
initial-value problem, which is amenable to solution using the Laplace transform.
While many of the problems considered in this chapter can be solved by the clas-
sical approach of Chapter 10, the Laplace transform leads to a more uniﬁed approach
and provides the engineer with greater insight into system behaviour. In practice, the
input signal u(t) may be a discontinuous or periodic function, or even a pulse, and in
such cases the use of the Laplace transform has distinct advantages over the classical
approach. Also, more often than not, an engineer is interested not only in system ana-
lysis but also in system synthesis or design. Consequently, an engineer’s objective in
studying a system’s response to speciﬁc inputs is frequently to learn more about the sys-
tem with a view to improving or controlling it so that it satisﬁes certain speciﬁcations.
It is in this area that the use of the Laplace transform is attractive, since by considering
the system response to particular inputs, such as a sinusoid, it provides the engineer
with powerful graphical methods for system design that are relatively easy to apply and
widely used in practice.
In modelling the system by a differential equation, it has been assumed that both the
input and output signals can vary at any instant of time; that is, they are functions of a
continuous time variable (note that this does not mean that the signals themselves have
to be continuous functions of time). Such systems are called continuous-time systems,
and it is for investigating these that the Laplace transform is best suited. With the intro-
duction of computer control into system design, signals associated with a system may
only change at discrete instants of time. In such cases the system is said to be a discrete-
time system, and is modelled by a difference equation rather than a differential equa-
tion. Such systems are dealt with using the z transform considered in the companion
text Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.
In this chapter we restrict our consideration to simply introducing the Laplace trans-
form and to illustrating its use in solving differential equations. Its more extensive role
in engineering applications is dealt with in the companion text.
There is some overlap in the material covered in this chapter and in Chapter 10,
particularly in relation to the modelling aspects of applications to electrical circuits and
mechanical vibrations. This overlap has been included so that the two approaches to
solving differential equations can be studied independently of each other.

The Laplace transform
11.2.1
Deﬁnition and notation
We deﬁne the Laplace transform of a function f(t) by the expression
{ f(t)} =
0
∞
e−stf(t)dt
(11.1)
where s is a complex variable and e−st is called the kernel of the transformation.
It is usual to represent the Laplace transform of a function by the corresponding
capital letter, so that we write
{ f(t)} = F(s) =
0
∞
e−stf(t)dt
(11.2)
An alternative notation in common use is to denote { f(t)} by f(s) or simply f.
Before proceeding, there are a few observations relating to the deﬁnition (11.2) 
worthy of comment.
(a) The symbol  denotes the Laplace transform operator; when it operates on a
function f(t), it transforms it into a function F(s) of the complex variable s. We say the
operator transforms the function f(t) in the t domain (usually called the time domain)
into the function F(s) in the s domain (usually called the complex frequency domain,
or simply the frequency domain). This relationship is depicted graphically in Fig-
ure 11.2, and it is usual to refer to f(t) and F(s) as a Laplace transform pair, written
as { f(t), F(s)}.
(b) Because the upper limit in the integral is inﬁnite, the domain of integration is
inﬁnite. Thus the integral is an example of an improper integral, as introduced in
Section 9.2; that is,

0
∞
e−stf(t)dt =

0
T
e−stf(t)dt
This immediately raises the question of whether or not the integral converges, an issue
we shall consider in Section 11.2.3.

11.2 THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
903
(c) Because the lower limit in the integral is zero, it follows that when taking the
Laplace transform, the behaviour of f(t) for negative values of t is ignored or sup-
pressed. This means that F(s) contains information on the behaviour of f(t) only for 
t  0, so that the Laplace transform is not a suitable tool for investigating problems 
in which values of f(t) for t  0 are relevant. In most engineering applications this 
does not cause any problems, since we are then concerned with physical systems for
which the functions we are dealing with vary with time t. An attribute of physical 
realizable systems is that they are non-anticipatory, in the sense that there is no out-
put (or response) until an input (or excitation) is applied. Because of this causal rela-
tionship between the input and output, we deﬁne a function f(t) to be causal if f(t) = 0 
(t  0). In general, however, unless the domain is clearly speciﬁed, a function f(t) is
normally intepreted as being deﬁned for all real values, both positive and negative, of
t. Making use of the Heaviside unit step function H(t) (see also Section 2.8.3), where
we have
Thus the effect of multiplying f(t) by H(t) is to convert it into a causal function.
Graphically, the relationship between f(t) and f(t)H(t) is as shown in Figure 11.3.
It follows that the corresponding Laplace transform F(s) contains full information on
the behaviour of f(t)H(t). Consequently, strictly speaking one, should refer to { f(t)H(t),
F(s)} rather than { f(t), F(s)} as being a Laplace transform pair. However, it is common
practice to drop the H(t) and assume that we are dealing with causal functions.
(d) If the behaviour of f(t) for t  0 is of interest then we need to use the alternative
two-sided or bilateral Laplace transform of the function f(t), deﬁned by
B{ f(t)} =
∞
−∞
e−stf (t)dt
(11.3)
The Laplace transform deﬁned by (11.2), with lower limit zero, is sometimes referred to
as the one-sided or unilateral Laplace transform of the function f(t). In this chapter
we shall concern ourselves only with the latter transform, and refer to it simply as the
Laplace transform of the function f(t). Note that when f(t) is a causal function,

INTRODUCTION TO LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
Solution
Since
e jat = cos at + jsinat
we may write
f(t) = sin at = Im(e jat),
g(t) = cos at = Re(e jat)
Using this formulation, the required transforms may be obtained from the result
,
Re(s)  Re(k)
of Example 11.3.
Taking k = ja in this result gives
Re(s)  0
or
Re(s)  0
Thus, equating real and imaginary parts and assuming s is real,
These results also hold when s is complex, giving us the Laplace transform pairs

Re(s)  0
(11.8)
Use of MATLAB and MAPLE to solve ordinary linear differential equations with
constant coefﬁcients was introduced in Section 10.8. Since the two chapters may be
studied independently, MATLAB and MAPLE commands are again introduced here.
In MATLAB, using the Symbolic Math Toolbox, the Laplace transform of a func-
tion f(t) is obtained by entering the commands
syms s t
laplace(f(t))
with the purpose of the ﬁrst command, as previously, being that of setting up s
and t as symbolic variables. To search for a simpler form of the symbolic answer
enter the command simple(ans). Sometimes repeated use of this command may

be necessary. If the function f(t) includes a parameter then this must be declared as
a symbolic term at the outset. For example, the commands
syms s t
laplace(sin(a*t))
return
ans = a/(s^2 + a^2)
as the Laplace transform of sin(at). To express this in a format that resembles 
typeset mathematics, enter the command pretty(ans).
Use of MAPLE is almost identical to the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox
except for minor semantic differences. However, when using MAPLE the integral
transform package must be invoked using inttrans and the variables t and s must
be speciﬁed explicitly. For instance the commands
with(inttrans):
laplace(sin(a*t),t,s);
return the transform as
11.2.3
Existence of the Laplace transform
Clearly, from the deﬁnition (11.2), the Laplace transform of a function f(t) exists if and
only if the improper integral in the deﬁnition converges for at least some values of s.
The examples of Section 11.2.2 suggest that this relates to the boundedness of the func-
tion, with the factor e−st in the transform integral acting like a convergence factor in that
the allowed values of Re(s) are those for which the integral converges. In order to be
able to state sufﬁcient conditions on f(t) for the existence of {f(t)}, we ﬁrst introduce
the deﬁnition of a function of exponential order.
Deﬁnition 11.1
A function f(t) is said to be of exponential order as t →∞if there exists a real
number σ and positive constants M and T such that
| f(t)|  Meσ t
for all t  T.
What this deﬁnition tells us is that a function f(t) is of exponential order if it
does not grow faster than some exponential function of the form Meσ t. Fortunately,
most functions of practical signiﬁcance satisfy this requirement, and are therefore of
exponential order. There are, however, functions that are not of exponential order,
an example being et2, since this grows more rapidly than Meσ t as t →∞, whatever the 
values of M and σ.

s

Example 11.5
The function f(t) = e3t is of exponential order, with σ  3.
Example 11.6
Show that the function f(t) = t3 (t  0) is of exponential order.
Solution
Since
eα t = 1 + αt +
α2t2 +
α3t3 + …
(see Figure 9.6) it follows that for any α  0
so that t3 is of exponential order, with σ  0.
It follows from Examples 11.5 and 11.6 that the choice of σ in Deﬁnition 11.1 is not
unique for a particular function. For this reason, we deﬁne the greatest lower bound σc
of the set of possible values of σ to be the abscissa of convergence of f(t). Thus, in the
case of the function f(t) = e3t, σc = 3, while in the case of the function f(t) = t3, σc = 0.
Returning to the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform given by (11.2), it follows
that if f(t) is a continuous function and is also of exponential order with abscissa of
convergence σc, so that
| f(t)|  Meσ t,
σ  σc
then, taking T = 0 in Deﬁnition 11.1 and noting that the absolute value of an integral is
always equal to or less than the integral of the absolute value
| F(s)| =
 
0
∞
| e−st| | f(t)| dt
Writing s = σ + jω, where σ and ω are real, since |e−jω t| = 1, we have
| e−st| = | e−σ t| | e−jω t| = | e−σ t| = e−σ t
so that

This last integral is ﬁnite whenever σ = Re(s)  σd. Since σd can be chosen arbitrarily
such that σd  σc we conclude that F(s) exists for σ  σc. Thus a continuous function
f(t) of exponential order, with abscissa of convergence σc, has a Laplace transform
{ f(t)} = F(s),
Re(s)  σc
where the region of convergence is as shown in Figure 11.4.

INTRODUCTION TO LAPLACE TRANSFORMS

11.2 THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
909
In fact, the requirement that f(t) be continuous is not essential, and may be relaxed
to f(t) being piecewise-continuous, as deﬁned in Section 8.8.2; that is, f(t) must have
only a ﬁnite number of ﬁnite discontinuities, being elsewhere continuous and bounded.
We conclude this section by stating a theorem that ensures the existence of a Laplace
transform.
Theorem 11.1
Existence of Laplace transform
If the causal function f(t) is piecewise-continuous on [0, ∞] and is of exponential order,
with abscissa of convergence σc, then its Laplace transform exists, with region of
convergence Re(s)  σc in the s domain; that is,
{ f(t)} = F(s) =
0
∞
e−stf(t)dt,
Re(s)  σc
end of theorem
The conditions of this theorem are sufﬁcient for ensuring the existence of the Laplace
transform of a function. They do not, however, constitute necessary conditions for the
existence of such a transform, and it does not follow that if the conditions are violated
then a transform does not exist. In fact, the conditions are more restrictive than neces-
sary, since there exist functions with inﬁnite discontinuities that possess Laplace
transforms.
11.2.4
Properties of the Laplace transform
In this section we consider some of the properties of the Laplace transform that will
enable us to ﬁnd further transform pairs { f(t), F(s)} without having to compute them
directly using the deﬁnition. Further properties will be developed in later sections when
the need arises.
Property 11.1: The linearity property
A fundamental property of the Laplace transform is its linearity, which may be stated
as follows:
Figure 11.4
Region of convergence
for {f(t)}; σc is the
abscissa of
convergence for f(t).

If f (t) and g(t) are functions having Laplace transforms and if α and β are 
any constants then
{αf(t) + βg(t)} = α{ f(t)} + β{g(t)}
As a consequence of this property, we say that the Laplace transform operator  is a
linear operator. A proof of the property follows readily from the deﬁnition (11.2),
since
{αf(t) + βg(t)} =
0
∞
[αf(t) + βg(t)]e−stdt

= α
0
∞
f(t)e−stdt + β
0
∞
g(t)e−stdt
= α{f(t)} + β{g(t)}
Regarding the region of convergence, if f(t) and g(t) have abscissae of convergence σf
and σg respectively, and σ1  σf, σ2  σg, then
| f(t)|  M1eσ1t,
| g(t)|  M2eσ2t
It follows that
|αf(t) + βg(t)|  |α | | f(t)| + | β| | g(t)|
 |α | M1eσ1t + |β| M2eσ2t
 (|α | M1 + |β| M2)eσ t
where σ = max(σ1, σ2), so that the abscissa of convergence of the linear sum αf(t) + βg(t)
is less than or equal to the maximum of those for f (t) and g(t).
This linearity property may clearly be extended to a linear combination of any ﬁnite
number of functions.

The ﬁrst shift property is another property that enables us to add more combinations to
our repertoire of Laplace transform pairs. As with the linearity property, it will prove
to be of considerable importance in our later discussions, particularly when considering
the inversion of Laplace transforms.
Property 11.2: The ﬁrst shift property
The property is contained in the following theorem, commonly referred to as the ﬁrst
shift theorem or sometimes as the exponential modulation theorem.
Theorem 11.2
The ﬁrst shift theorem
If f(t) is a function having Laplace transform F(s), with Re(s)  σc, then the function
eatf(t) also has a Laplace transform, given by
{eatf(t)} = F(s −a),
Re(s)  σc + Re(a)
Proof
A proof of the theorem follows directly from the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform,
since
{eatf(t)} =
0
∞
eatf(t)e−stdt =
0
∞
f(t)e−(s−a)tdt
Then, since
{ f(t)} = F(s) =
0
∞
f(t)e−stdt,
Re(s)  σc
we see that the last integral above is in structure exactly the Laplace transform of f(t)
itself, except that s −a takes the place of s, so that
{eatf(t)} = F(s −a),
Re(s −a)  σc
or
{eatf(t)} = F(s −a),
Re(s)  σc + Re(a)
end of theorem
An alternative way of expressing the result of Theorem 11.2, which may be found
more convenient in application, is
{eatf(t)} = [{f(t)}]s→s−a = [F(s)]s→s−a
In other words, the theorem says that the Laplace transform of eat times a function f(t)
is equal to the Laplace transform of f(t) itself, with s replaced by s −a.

INTRODUCTION TO LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
Entering the further commands
simple(ans);
pretty(ans)
returns
2/(s2 + 6s + 13)
as an alternative form of the answer. Note that the last two commands could be
replaced by the single command pretty(simple(ans)).
In MAPLE the commands

laplace(exp(–3*t)*sin(2*t),t,s);

There is no ‘simple’ command in MAPLE.
The function e−3tsin2t in Example 11.10 is a member of a general class of functions
called damped sinusoids. These play an important role in the study of engineering 
systems, particularly in the analysis of vibrations. For this reason, we add the following
two general members of the class to our standard library of Laplace transform pairs:
{e−ktsin at} 
Re(s)  −k
(11.9)
{e−ktcos at} 
Re(s)  −k
(11.10)
where in both cases k and a are real constants.
Property 11.3: Derivative-of-transform property
This property relates operations in the time domain to those in the transformed s domain,
but initially we shall simply look upon it as a method of increasing our repertoire of
Laplace transform pairs. The property is also sometimes referred to as the multiplication-
by-t property. A statement of the property is contained in the following theorem.
Theorem 11.3
Derivative of transform
If f(t) is a function having Laplace transform
F(s) = { f(t)},
Re(s)  σc
then the functions t nf(t) (n = 1, 2, …) also have Laplace transforms, given by
{t nf(t)} = (−1)n

11.2 THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Proof
By deﬁnition,
{ f(t)} = F(s) =
0
∞
e−stf(t)dt
so that

0
∞
e−stf(t)dt
Owing to the convergence properties of the improper integral involved, we can inter-
change the operations of differentiation and integration and differentiate with respect to
s under the integral sign. Thus
[e−stf(t)]dt
which, on carrying out the repeated differentiation, gives
= (−1)n
0
∞
e−stt nf(t)dt = (−1)n{t nf(t)},
Re(s)  σc
the region of convergence remaining unchanged.
end of theorem
In other words, Theorem 11.3 says that differentiating the transform of a function
with respect to s is equivalent to multiplying the function itself by −t. As with the pre-
vious properties, we can now use this result to add to our list of Laplace transform pairs.
Example 11.11
Determine {t sin3t}.
Solution
Using the result (11.7),
{sin3t} = F(s) 
Re(s)  0
so, by the derivative theorem,
{t sin3t} 
Re(s)  0

ans = 6/(s^2 + 9)/s/(1 + 9/s^2)
Repeating the simple command

11.2.7
The inverse transform
The symbol −1{F(s)} denotes a causal function f(t) whose Laplace transform is F(s);
that is,
if
{ f(t)} = F(s)
then
f(t) = −1{F(s)}
This correspondence between the functions F(s) and f(t) is called the inverse Laplace
transformation, f(t) being the inverse transform of F(s), and −1 being referred to
as the inverse Laplace transform operator. These relationships are depicted in
Figure 11.6.
As was pointed out in observation (c) of Section 11.2.1, the Laplace transform F(s)
only determines the behaviour of f(t) for t  0. Thus −1{F(s)} = f(t) only for t  0.
When writing −1{F(s)} = f(t), it is assumed that t  0, so, strictly speaking, we should
write
−1{F(s)} = f(t)H(t)
(11.11)

it follows that
Example 11.15
Since
it follows that
The linearity property for the Laplace transform (Property 11.1) states that if α and β
are any constants then
{αf(t) + βg(t)} = α{ f(t)} + β{g(t)} = αF(s) + βG(s)
It then follows from the above deﬁnition that
−1{αF(s) + βG(s)} = αf(t) + βg(t) = α−1{F(s)} + β−1{G(s)}
so that the inverse Laplace transform operator −1 is also a linear operator.
11.2.8
Evaluation of inverse transforms
The most obvious way of ﬁnding the inverse transform of the function F(s) is to make
use of a table of transforms, such as that given in Figure 11.5. Sometimes it is possible
to write down the inverse transform directly from the table, but more often than not it
is ﬁrst necessary to carry out some algebraic manipulation on F(s). In particular, we
frequently need to determine the inverse transform of a rational function of the form
p(s)/q(s), where p(s) and q(s) are polynomials in s. In such cases the procedure is ﬁrst
to resolve the function into partial fractions and then to use the table of transforms.
Using the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox the commands
syms s t
ilaplace(F(s))
return the inverse transform of F(s). The corresponding MAPLE commands are

Inversion using the ﬁrst shift theorem
In Theorem 11.2 we saw that if F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t) then, for a scalar a,
F(s −a) is the Laplace transform of eatf(t). This theorem normally causes little difﬁculty
when used to obtain the Laplace transforms of functions, but it does frequently lead to
problems when used to obtain inverse transforms. Expressed in the inverse form, the
theorem becomes
−1{F(s −a)} = eatf(t)
The notation
−1{[F(s)]s→s−a} = eat[ f(t)]
where F(s) = {f(t)} and [F(s)]s→s−a denotes that s in F(s) is replaced by s −a, may

11.3
Solution of differential equations
We ﬁrst consider the Laplace transforms of derivatives and integrals, and then apply
these to the solution of differential equations.
11.3.1
Transforms of derivatives
If we are to use Laplace transform methods to solve differential equations, we need to
ﬁnd convenient expressions for the Laplace transforms of derivatives such as df/dt,
d2f/dt2 or, in general, dnf/dt n. By deﬁnition,

Integrating by parts, we have
= [e−stf(t)]0
∞+ s
0
∞
e−stf(t)dt
= −f(0) + sF(s)
that is,
(11.12)
In taking the Laplace transform of a derivative we have assumed that f(t) is continuous
at t = 0, so that f(0−) = f(0) = f(0+). In the companion text Advanced Modern Engineer-
ing Mathematics there are occasions when f(0−) ≠f(0+) and we have to revert to a
more generalized calculus to resolve the problem.
The advantage of using the Laplace transform when dealing with differential equa-
tions can readily be seen, since it enables us to replace the operation of differentiation
in the time domain by a simple algebraic operation in the s domain.
Note that to deduce the result (11.12), we have assumed that f(t) is continuous, with
a piecewise-continuous derivative df/dt, for t  0 and that it is also of exponential order
as t →∞.
Likewise, if both f(t) and df/dt are continuous on t  0 and are of exponential order
as t →∞, and d2f/dt2 is piecewise-continuous for t  0, then
which, on using (11.11), gives
leading to the result
(11.13)
Clearly, provided that f(t) and its derivatives satisfy the required conditions, this 
procedure may be extended to obtain the Laplace transform of f (n)(t) = dnf/dt n in the
form

a result that may be readily proved by induction.
Again it is noted that in determining the Laplace transform of f (n)(t) we have
assumed that f (n−1)(t) is continuous.
11.3.2
Transforms of integrals
In some applications the behaviour of a system may be represented by an integro-
differential equation, which is an equation containing both derivatives and integrals of
the unknown variable. For example, the current i in a series electrical circuit consisting
of a resistance R, an inductance L and capacitance C, and subject to an applied voltage
E, is given by
To solve such equations directly, it is convenient to be able to obtain the Laplace 
transform of integrals such as 0

11.3.3
Ordinary differential equations
Having obtained expressions for the Laplace transforms of derivatives, we are now in
a position to use Laplace transform methods to solve ordinary linear differential equa-
tions with constant coefﬁcients, which were introduced in Chapter 10. To illustrate this,
consider the general second-order linear differential equation
(11.16)
subject to the initial conditions x(0) = x0, :(0) = v0 where as usual a dot denotes differ-
entiation with respect to time, t. Such a differential equation may model the dynamics
of some system for which the variable x(t) determines the response of the system to the
forcing or excitation term u(t). The terms system input and system output are also
frequently used for u(t) and x(t) respectively. Since the differential equation is linear
and has constant coefﬁcients, a system characterized by such a model is said to be a
linear time-invariant system.
Taking Laplace transforms of each term in (11.16) gives
which on using (11.12) and (11.13) leads to
a[s2X(s) −sx(0) −:(0)] + b[sX(s) −x(0)] + cX(s) = U(s)
Rearranging, and incorporating the given initial conditions, gives
(as2 + bs + c)X(s) = U(s) + (as + b)x0 + av0

INTRODUCTION TO LAPLACE TRANSFORMS

11.3 SOLUTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
927
Equation (11.17) determines the Laplace transform X(s) of the response, from which,
by taking the inverse transform, the desired time response x(t) may be obtained.
Before considering speciﬁc examples, there are a few observations worth noting at
this stage.
(a) As we have already noted in Section 11.3.1, a distinct advantage of using the Laplace
transform is that it enables us to replace the operation of differentiation by an algebraic
operation. Consequently, by taking the Laplace transform of each term in a differential
equation, it is converted into an algebraic equation in the variable s. This may then be
rearranged using algebraic rules to obtain an expression for the Laplace transform of
the response; the desired time response is then obtained by taking the inverse transform.
(b) The Laplace transform method yields the complete solution to the linear differen-
tial equation, with the initial conditions automatically included. This contrasts with the
classical approach adopted in Chapter 10, in which the general solution consists of two
components, the complementary function and the particular integral, with the initial
conditions determining the undetermined constants associated with the complementary
function. When the solution is expressed in the general form (11.17), upon inversion
the term involving U(s) leads to a particular integral while that involving x0 and v0 gives
a complementary function. A useful side issue is that an explicit solution for the 
transient is obtained that reﬂects the initial conditions.
(c) The Laplace transform method is ideally suited for solving initial-value problems;
that is, linear differential equations in which all the initial conditions x(0), :(0), and so on,
at time t = 0 are speciﬁed. The method is less attractive for boundary-value problems,
when the conditions on x(t) and its derivatives are not all speciﬁed at t = 0, but some
are speciﬁed at other values of the independent variable. It is still possible, however, 
to use the Laplace transform method by assigning arbitrary constants to one or more 
of the initial conditions and then determining their values using the given boundary
conditions.
(d) It should be noted that the denominator of the right-hand side of (11.17) is the left-
hand side of (11.16) with the operator d/dt replaced by s. The denominator equated to
zero also corresponds to the auxiliary equation or characteristic equation used in the
classical approach. Given a speciﬁc initial-value problem, the process of obtaining a
solution using Laplace transform methods is fairly straightforward, and is illustrated by
Example 11.23.
Example 11.23
Solve the differential equation
subject to the initial conditions x = 1 and dx/dt = 0 at t = 0.

leads to the transformed equation
[s2X(s) −sx(0) −:(0)] + 5[sX(s) −x(0)] + 6X(s) =
which on rearrangement gives
(s2 + 5s + 6)X(s) =
+ (s + 5)x(0) + :(0)
Incorporating the given initial conditions x(0) = 1 and :(0) = 0 leads to
(s2 + 5s + 6)X(s) =
+ s + 5
That is,
Resolving the rational terms into partial fractions gives
Taking inverse transforms gives the desired solution
x(t) = e−t + e−2t −e−3t
(t  0)
In principle the procedure adopted in Example 11.23 for solving a second-order 
linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients is readily carried over to higher-
order differential equations. A general nth-order linear differential equation may be
written as
(11.18)
where an, an−1, … , a0 are constants, with an ≠0. This may be written in the more 
concise form
q(D)x(t) = u(t)
(11.19)
where D denotes the operator d/dt and q(D) is the polynomial
The objective is then to determine the response x(t) for a given forcing function u(t)
subject to the given set of initial conditions

Taking Laplace transforms in (11.19) and proceeding as before leads to
where
Then, in principle, by taking the inverse transform, the desired response x(t) may be
obtained as
For high-order differential equations the process of performing this inversion may prove
to be rather tedious, and matrix methods may be used, as indicated in Chapter 5 of the
companion text Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.
To conclude this section, further worked examples are developed in order to help
consolidate understanding of this method for solving linear differential equations.
Example 11.24
Solve the differential equation

INTRODUCTION TO LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
Resolving into partial fractions gives
that is,
Taking inverse transforms, using the shift theorem, leads to the desired solution
In MATLAB, using the Symbolic Math Toolbox, the command dsolve computes
symbolic solutions to differential equations. The letter D denotes differentiation
whilst the symbols D2, D3, …, DN denote the 2nd, 3rd, … , Nth derivatives respect-
ively. The dependent variable is that preceded by D whilst the default independent
variable is t. The independent variable can be changed from t to another symbolic
variable by including that variable as the last input variable. The initial conditions
are speciﬁed by additional equations, such as Dx(0) = 6. If the initial conditions
are not speciﬁed the solution will contain constants of integration such as C1 and C2.
For the differential equation of Example 11.24 the MATLAB commands
syms x t
x = dsolve(D2x + 6*Dx + 9*x = sin(t)’, ‘x(0) = 0,Dx(0) = 0’);
pretty(simple(x))
return the solution
x = –3/50cos(t) + 2/25sin(t) + 3/50(1/exp(t)3) +
1/10(t/exp(t)3)
It is left as an exercise to express 1/exp(t)3 as e–3t.
In MAPLE the command dsolve is also used and the commands
ode2:= diff(x(t),t,t) + 6*diff(x(t),t) + 9*x(t) = sin(t);
dsolve({ode2, x(0) = 0, D(x)(0) = 0}, x(t));

If the initial conditions were not speciﬁed then the command

returns the solution
x(t) = e(–3t)C1 + e(–3t)tC2 –
3––
50cos(t) +
2––

In MAPLE it is also possible to specify a solution by the Laplace method and the 
command

laplace);

Solution
Taking Laplace transforms

Simultaneous differential equations
In engineering we frequently encounter systems whose characteristics are modelled
by a set of simultaneous linear differential equations with constant coefﬁcients. The
method of solution is essentially the same as that adopted in Section 11.3.3 for solving
a single differential equation in one unknown. Taking Laplace transforms throughout,
the system of simultaneous differential equations is transformed into a system of simul-
taneous algebraic equations, which are then solved for the transformed variables;
inverse transforms then give the desired solutions.
Example 11.26
Solve for t  0 the simultaneous ﬁrst-order differential equations
(11.20)
(11.21)
subject to the initial conditions x = 2 and y = 1 at t = 0.
Solution
Taking Laplace transforms in (11.20) and (11.21) gives
sX(s) −x(0) + sY(s) −y(0) + 5X(s) + 3Y(s) =
2[sX(s) −x(0)] + sY(s) −y(0) + X(s) + Y(s) =
Rearranging and incorporating the given initial conditions x(0) = 2 and y(0) = 1 leads to
(s + 5)X(s) + (s + 3)Y(s) =
(11.22)
(2s + 1)X(s) + (s + 1)Y(s) =  
(11.23)
Hence, by taking Laplace transforms, the pair of simultaneous differential equations
(11.20) and (11.21) in x(t) and y(t) has been transformed into a pair of simultaneous
algebraic equations (11.22) and (11.23) in the transformed variables X(s) and Y(s).
These algebraic equations may now be solved simultaneously for X(s) and Y(s) using
standard algebraic techniques.
Solving ﬁrst for X(s) gives

Resolving into partial fractions,

Likewise, solving for Y(s) gives
Resolving into partial fractions,
which on inversion gives
Thus the solution to the given pair of simultaneous differential equations is
Note: When solving a pair of ﬁrst-order simultaneous differential equations such as (11.20)
and (11.21), an alternative approach to obtaining the value of y(t) having obtained x(t)
is to use (11.20) and (11.21) directly.
Eliminating dy/dt from (11.20) and (11.21) gives
Substituting the solution obtained in (11.24) for x(t) gives
leading as before to the solution
A further alternative is to express (11.22) and (11.23) in matrix form and solve for X(s)
and Y(s) using Gaussian elimination.
In MATLAB the solution to the pair of simultaneous differential equations of
Example 11.26 may be obtained using the commands

y = –25/2*exp(t) + 11/2*exp(–2*t) + 15/2 + 1/2*exp(–t)
These can then be expressed in typeset form using the commands pretty(x) and
pretty(y). In MAPLE the commands
ode1:= D(x)(t) + D(y)(t) + 5*x(t) + 3*y(t) = exp(–t);
ode2:= 2*D(x)(t) + D(y)(t) + x(t) + y(t) = 3;

quite complicated, and matrix methods are usually preferred.

Engineering applications: electrical circuits and 
mechanical vibrations
To illustrate the use of Laplace transforms, we consider here their application to the
analysis of electrical circuits and vibrating mechanical systems. Since initial conditions
are automatically taken into account in the transformation process, the Laplace trans-
form is particularly attractive for examining the transient behaviour of such systems.
Although electrical circuits and mechanical vibrations were considered in Chapter 10,
we shall review here the modelling aspects in each case. This is to enable the two 
chapters to be studied independently of each other.
Using the commands adapted in the previous sections, MATLAB or MAPLE can be
used throughout this section to conﬁrm answers obtained.
11.4.1
Electrical circuits
Passive electrical circuits are constructed of three basic elements: resistors (having
resistance R, measured in ohms Ω), capacitors (having capacitance C, measured in farads
F) and inductors (having inductance L, measured in henries H), with the associated
variables being current i(t) (measured in amperes A) and voltage v(t) (measured in
volts V). The current ﬂow in the circuit is related to the charge q(t) (measured in
coulombs C) by the relationship
Conventionally, the basic elements are represented symbolically as in Figure 11.7.

of an electrical circuit.

11.4 ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS: ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS AND MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS
937
The relationships between the ﬂow of current i(t) and the voltage drops v(t) across
these elements at time t are
voltage drop across resistor = Ri
(Ohm’s law)
voltage drop across capacitor =
The interaction between the individual elements making up an electrical circuit is 
determined by Kirchhoff’s laws:
Law 1
The algebraic sum of all the currents entering any junction (or node) of a circuit is zero.
Law 2
The algebraic sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop (or path) in a circuit is
zero.
Use of these laws leads to circuit equations, which may then be analysed using Laplace
transform techniques.
Example 11.27
The LCR circuit of Figure 11.8 consists of a resistor R, a capacitor C and an inductor L
connected in series together with a voltage source e(t). Prior to closing the switch at
time t = 0, both the charge on the capacitor and the resulting current in the circuit are
zero. Determine the charge q(t) on the capacitor and the resulting current i(t) in the
circuit at time t, given that R = 160 Ω, L = 1 H, C = 10−4 F and e(t) = 20V.
Solution
Applying Kirchhoff’s second law to the circuit of Figure 11.8 gives
(11.25)

(s2 + 160s + 104)Q(s) = [sq(0) + {(0)] + 160q(0) +
where Q(s) is the transform of q(t). We are given that q(0) = 0 and {(0) = i(0) = 0, so
that this reduces to
(s2 + 160s + 104)Q(s) =

Resolving into partial fractions gives
Taking inverse transforms, making use of the shift theorem (Theorem 11.2), gives
The resulting current i(t) in the circuit is then given by
Note that we could have determined the current by taking Laplace transforms in (11.25).
Substituting the given values for L, R, C and e(t) and using (11.15) leads to the trans-
formed equation
160I(s) + sI(s) +
I(s) =

Solution
Applying Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law to node X gives
i = i1 + i2
Applying Kirchhoff’s second law to each of the two loops in turn gives
R1(i1 + i2) + L1
(i1 + i2) + R2i1 = 200
+ R3i2 −R2i1 = 0
Substituting the given values for the resistances and inductances gives
(11.26)
Taking Laplace transforms and incorporating the initial conditions i1(0) = i2(0) = 0 leads
to the transformed equations
(s + 56)I1(s) + (s + 40)I2(s) =
(11.27)
−8I1(s) + (s + 10)I2(s) = 0
(11.28)
Hence

that is,
i1(t) = 4.55 −7.49e−59.1t + 2.98e−14.9t
Note that as t → ∞, the currents i1(t) and i2(t) approach the constant values 4.55A and
3.64A respectively. (Note that i(0) = i1(0) + i2(0) ≠0 due to rounding errors in the 
calculation.)
Example 11.29
A voltage e(t) is applied to the primary circuit at time t = 0, and mutual induction M
drives the current i2(t) in the secondary circuit of Figure 11.10. If, prior to closing the
switch, the currents in both circuits are zero, determine the induced current i2(t) in the
secondary circuit at time t when R1 = 4 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, L1 = 2 H, L2 = 8 H, M = 2H and
e(t) = 28sin2t V.
Solution
Applying Kirchhoff’s second law to the primary and secondary circuits respectively
gives
Substituting the given values for the resistances, inductances and applied voltage leads to
Taking Laplace transforms and noting that i1(0) = i2(0) = 0 leads to the equations
(s + 2)I1(s) + sI2(s) =

As t →∞, the current will approach the sinusoidal response
11.4.2
Mechanical vibrations
Mechanical translational systems may be used to model many situations, and involve
three basic elements: masses (having mass M, measured in kg), springs (having spring
stiffness K, measured in Nm−1) and dampers (having damping coefﬁcient B, measured
in Nsm−1). The associated variables are displacement x(t) (measured in m) and force
F(t) (measured in N). Conventionally, the basic elements are represented symbolically,
as in Figure 11.11.
Assuming we are dealing with ideal springs and dampers (that is, assuming that they
behave linearly), the relationships between the forces and displacements at time t are
mass:
(Newton’s law)
spring:
F = K(x2 −x1)
(Hooke’s law)
damper:
Using these relationships leads to the system equations, which may then be analysed
using Laplace transform techniques.
Example 11.30
The mass of the mass–spring–damper system of Figure 11.12(a) is subjected to an
externally applied periodic force F(t) = 4 sinωt at time t = 0. Determine the resulting
displacement x(t) of the mass at time t, given that x(0) = :(0) = 0, for the two cases
(a) ω = 2
(b) ω = 5
In the case ω = 5, what would happen to the response if the damper were missing?

Figure 11.11
Constituent elements
of a translational
mechanical system.

Solution
As indicated in Figure 11.12(b), the forces acting on the mass M are the applied force
F(t) and the restoring forces F1 and F2 due to the spring and damper respectively. Thus,
by Newton’s law,
M;(t) = F(t) −F1(t) −F2(t)
Since M = 1, F(t) = 4 sin ωt, F1(t) = Kx(t) = 25x(t) and F2(t) = B:(t) = 6:(t), this gives
;(t) + 6:(t) + 25x(t) = 4 sin ωt
(11.31)
as the differential equation representing the motion of the system.
Taking Laplace transforms throughout in (11.31) gives
(s2 + 6s + 25)X(s) = [sx(0) + :(0)] + 6x(0) +
where X(s) is the transform of x(t). Incorporating the given initial conditions 
x(0) = :(0) = 0 leads to
(11.32)
In case (a), with ω = 2, (11.32) gives
which, on resolving into partial fractions, leads to
Taking inverse Laplace transforms gives the required response
x(t) =
(7sin2t −4 cos 2t) + 
e−3t(8cos4t −sin4t)

that is,
which, on taking inverse Laplace transforms, gives the required response
(11.35)
If the damping term were missing then (11.34) would become
(11.36)
By Theorem 11.3,
that is,
Thus, by the linearity property (11.10),
{ sin 5t −t cos5t} =
so that taking inverse Laplace transforms in (11.36) gives the response as
x(t) =
(sin5t −5t cos5t)
Because of the term tcos5t, the response x(t) is unbounded as t → ∞. This arises because
in this case the applied force F(t) = 4 sin 5t is in resonance with the system (that is, the
vibrating mass), whose natural oscillating frequency is 5/2π Hz, equal to that of the
applied force. Even in the presence of damping, the amplitude of the system response
is maximized when the applied force is approaching resonance with the system. (This
is left as an exercise for the reader.) In the absence of damping we have the limiting
case of pure resonance, leading to an unbounded response. As noted in Section 10.10.3,
resonance is of practical importance, since, for example, it can lead to large and strong
structures collapsing under what appears to be a relatively small force.
Example 11.31
Consider the mechanical system of Figure 11.13(a), which consists of two masses
M1 = 1 and M2 = 2, each attached to a ﬁxed base by a spring, having constants K1 = 1
and K3 = 2 respectively, and attached to each other by a third spring having constant
K2 = 2. The system is released from rest at time t = 0 in a position in which M1 is
displaced 1 unit to the left of its equilibrium position and M2 is displaced 2 units to
the right of its equilibrium position. Neglecting all frictional effects, determine the 
positions of the masses at time t.

Solution
Let x1(t) and x2(t) denote the displacements of the masses M1 and M2 respectively from
their equilibrium positions. Since frictional effects are neglected, the only forces acting
on the masses are the restoring forces due to the springs, as shown in Figure 11.13(b).
Applying Newton’s law to the motions of M1 and M2 respectively gives
M1;1 = F2 −F1 = K2(x2 −x1) −K1x1
M2;2 = −F3 −F2 = −K3x2 −K2(x2 −x1)
which, on substituting the given values for M1, M2, K1, K2 and K3, gives
;1 + 3x1 −2x2 = 0
(11.37)
2;2 + 4x2 −2x1 = 0
(11.38)
Taking Laplace transforms leads to the equations
(s2 + 3)X1(s) −2X2(s) = sx1(0) + :1(0)
−X1(s) + (s2 + 2)X2(s) = sx2(0) + :2(0)
Since x1(t) and x2(t) denote displacements to the right of the equilibrium positions, we have
x1(0) = −1 and x2(0) = 2. Also, the system is released from rest, so that :1(0) = :2(0) = 0.
Incorporating these initial conditions, the transformed equations become
(s2 + 3)X1(s) −2X2(s) = −s
(11.39)
−X1(s) + (s2 + 2)X2(s) = 2s
(11.40)
Hence
Resolving into partial fractions gives
which, on taking inverse Laplace transforms, leads to the response
x2(t) = cos t + cos2t
Substituting for x2(t) in (11.38) gives
x1(t) = 2x2(t) + ;2(t)

INTRODUCTION TO LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
14
A system consists of two unit masses lying in a
straight line on a smooth surface and connected
together to two ﬁxed points by three springs. When
a sinusoidal force is applied to the system, the
displacements x1(t) and x2(t) of the respective
masses from their equilibrium positions satisfy
the equations
Given that the system is initially at rest in the
equilibrium position (x1 = x2 = 0), use the Laplace
transform method to solve the equations for x1(t)
and x2(t).

(b) The equation of motion of the moving coil of
a galvanometer when a current i is passed through
it is of the form
where θ is the angle of deﬂection from the
‘no-current’ position and n and K are positive
constants. Given that i is a constant and 
θ = 0 = dθ/dt when t = 0, obtain an expression 
for the Laplace transform of θ.
In constructing the galvanometer, it is desirable
to have it critically damped (that is, n = K). 
Use the Laplace transform method to solve the
differential equation in this case, and sketch the
graph of θ against t for positive values of t.

Two cylindrical water tanks are connected as
shown in Figure 11.22. Initially there are 250 litres
in the top tank and 50 litres in the bottom tank. At
time t = 0 the valve between the two tanks and the
valve at the bottom of the lower tank are opened.
The ﬂowrate through each of these valves is
proportional to the volume of water in the tank
immediately above the valve, the constant of
proportionality being 0.1 for both valves. Denoting
the volume in the top tank by v1 and the volume 
in the bottom tank by v2, show that the following
differential equations are satisﬁed.

12.1 INTRODUCTION

12.1
Introduction
The representation of a function in the form of a series is fairly common practice in
mathematics. Probably the most familiar expansions are power series of the form
in which the resolved components or base set comprise the power functions
1, x, x 2, x 3, … , x n, …
For example, we recall that the exponential function may be represented by the inﬁnite
series
There are frequently advantages in expanding a function in such a series, since the ﬁrst
few terms of a good approximation are easy to deal with. For example, term-by-term
integration or differentiation may be applied or suitable function approximations can 
be made.
Power functions comprise only one example of a base set for the expansions of func-
tions: a number of other base sets may be used. In particular, a Fourier series is an
expansion of a periodic function f(t) of period T = 2π/ω in which that base set is the set
of sine functions, giving an expanded representation of the form
Although the idea of expanding a function in the form of such a series had been used
by Bernoulli, D’Alembert and Euler (c. 1750) to solve problems associated with the
vibration of strings, it was Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) who developed the approach to
a stage where it was generally useful. Fourier, a French physicist, was interested in
heat-ﬂow problems: given an initial temperature at all points of a region, he was con-
cerned with determining the change in the temperature distribution over time. When
Fourier postulated in 1807 that an arbitrary function f(x) could be represented by a
trigonometric series of the form
the result was considered so startling that it met considerable opposition from the 
leading mathematicians of the time, notably Laplace, Poisson and, more signiﬁcantly,
Lagrange, who is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. They ques-
tioned his work because of its lack of rigour, and it was probably this opposition that
delayed the publication of Fourier’s work, his classic text Théorie Analytique de la
Chaleur (The Analytical Theory of Heat) not appearing until 1822. This text has since
become the source for the modern methods of solving practical problems associated
with partial differential equations subject to prescribed boundary conditions. In addition
to heat ﬂow, this class of problems includes structural vibrations, wave propagation and

diffusion, which are discussed in the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics. The task of giving Fourier’s work a more rigorous mathematical under-
pinning was undertaken later by Dirichlet (c. 1830) and subsequently Riemann, his 
successor at the University of Göttingen.
In addition to its use in solving boundary-value problems associated with partial
differential equations, Fourier series analysis is central to many other applications 
in engineering, such as the analysis and design of oscillating and nonlinear systems.
This chapter is intended to provide only an introduction to Fourier series, with a 
more detailed treatment, including consideration of frequency spectra, oscillating and
nonlinear systems, and generalized Fourier series, being given in Advanced Modern
Engineering Mathematics.
12.2
Fourier series expansion
In this section we develop the Fourier series expansion of periodic functions and dis-
cuss how closely they approximate the functions. We also indicate how symmetrical
properties of the function may be taken advantage of in order to reduce the amount 
of mathematical manipulation involved in determining the Fourier series. First, for
continuity, we review the properties of periodic functions considered in Section 2.2.6.
12.2.1
Periodic functions
A function f(t) is said to be periodic if its image values are repeated at regular intervals
in its domain. Thus the graph of a periodic function can be divided into ‘vertical strips’
that are replicas of each other, as illustrated in Figure 12.1. The interval between two
successive replicas is called the period of the function. We therefore say that a func-
tion f(t) is periodic with period T if, for all its domain values t,
f(t + mT) = f(t)
for any integer m.
To provide a measure of the number of repetitions per unit of t, we deﬁne the
frequency of a periodic function to be the reciprocal of its period, so that

The term circular frequency is also used in engineering, and is deﬁned by
circular frequency = 2π × frequency 
and is measured in radians per second. It is common to drop the term ‘circular’ and refer
to this simply as the frequency when the context is clear.
12.2.2
Fourier’s theorem
This theorem states that a periodic function that satisﬁes certain conditions can be
expressed as the sum of a number of sine functions of different amplitudes, phases and
periods. That is, if f(t) is a periodic function with period T then
f(t) = A0 + A1 sin(ωt + φ1) + A2sin(2ωt + φ2) + … 
+ An sin(nωt + φn) + … 
(12.1)
where the As and φs are constants and ω = 2π/T is the frequency of f(t). The term 
A1 sin(ωt + φ1) is called the ﬁrst harmonic or the fundamental mode, and it has the
same frequency ω as the parent function f(t). The term Ansin(nωt + φn) is called the 
nth harmonic, and it has frequency nω, which is n times that of the fundamental. An
denotes the amplitude of the nth harmonic and φn is its phase angle, measuring the lag
or lead of the nth harmonic with reference to a pure sine wave of the same frequency.
Since
An sin(nωt + φn) ≡(An cosφn)sinnωt + (Ansinφn)cosnωt
≡bn sin nωt + an cos nωt
where
bn = An cosφn,
an = An sinφn
(12.2)
the expansion (12.1) may be written as
(12.3)
where a0 = 2A0 (we shall see later that taking the ﬁrst term as
rather than a0 is a 
convenience that enables us to make a0 ﬁt a general result). The expansion (12.3) is
called the Fourier series expansion of the function f(t), and the as and bs are called 
the Fourier coefﬁcients. In electrical engineering it is common practice to refer to
an and bn respectively as the in-phase and phase quadrature components of the nth
harmonic, this terminology arising from the use of the phasor notation ejnωt = cos nωt
+ j sin nωt. Clearly, (12.1) is an alternative representation of the Fourier series, with the
amplitude and phase of the nth harmonic being determined from (12.2) as
An = ÷(a2
n + b2
n),
φn = tan−1
with care being taken over choice of quadrant.

cos mωt sin nωt dt = 0
(all m and n)
(12.8)
The results (12.4)–(12.8) constitute the orthogonality relations for sine and cosine
functions, and show that the set of functions
{1, cos ωt, cos 2ωt, … , cosnωt, sinωt, sin2ωt, … , sin nωt}
is an orthogonal set of functions on the interval d  t  d + T. The choice of d is arbi-
trary in these results, it only being necessary to integrate over a period of duration T.
Integrating the series (12.3) with respect to t over the period t = d to t = d + T, and
using (12.4) and (12.5), we ﬁnd that each term on the right-hand side is zero except for
the term involving a0; that is, we have

INTRODUCTION TO FOURIER SERIES

12.2 FOURIER SERIES EXPANSION
955
To obtain this result, we have assumed that term-by-term integration of the series (12.3)
is permissible. This is indeed so because of the convergence properties of the series –
its validity is discussed in detail in more advanced texts.
To obtain the Fourier coefﬁcient an (n ≠0), we multiply (12.3) throughout by
cos mωt and integrate with respect to t over the period t = d to t = d + T, giving


d
d+T
cos mωt sin nωt dt
Assuming term-by-term integration to be possible, and using (12.4), (12.7) and (12.8),
we ﬁnd that, when m ≠0, the only non-zero integral on the right-hand side is the one
that occurs in the ﬁrst summation when n = m. That is, we have

d
d+T
f(t)cosmωt dt = am
d
d+T
cos mωt cos mωt dt =
amT
giving
am = 
d
d+T
f(t)cosmωt dt
which, on replacing m by n, gives
an = 
d
d+T
f(t)cosnωt dt
(12.10)
The value of a0 given in (12.9) may be obtained by taking n = 0 in (12.10), so that we
may write
an = 
d
d+T
f(t)cosmωt dt
(n = 0, 1, 2, … )
(12.11)
This explains why the constant term in the Fourier series expansion was taken as 
and not a0, since this ensures compatibility of the results (12.9) and (12.10). Although
a0 and an satisfy the same formula, it is usually safer to work them out separately.
Finally, to obtain the Fourier coefﬁcients bn, we multiply (12.3) throughout by 
sin mωt and integrate with respect to t over the period t = d to t = d + T, giving

Assuming term-by-term integration to be possible, and using (12.5), (12.6) and (12.8),
we ﬁnd that the only non-zero integral on the right-hand side is the one that occurs in
the second summation when m = n. That is, we have

d
d+T
f(t)sinmωt dt = bm
d
d+T
sin mωt sin mωt dt = bmT
giving, on replacing m by n,
bn = 
d
d+T
f(t)sinnωt dt
(n = 1, 2, 3, … )
(12.12)
The equations (12.11) and (12.12) giving the Fourier coefﬁcients are known as Euler’s
formulae.
Summary
In summary, we have shown that if a periodic function f(t) of period T = 2π/ω can
be expanded as a Fourier series then that series is given by
(12.3)
where the coefﬁcients are given by Euler’s formulae
an = 
d
d+T
f(t)cosnωtdt
(n = 0, 1, 2, … )
(12.11)
bn = 
d
d+T
f(t)sinnωtdt
(n = 1, 2, 3, … )
(12.12)
The limits of integration in Euler’s formulae may be speciﬁed over any period, so
that the choice of d is arbitrary, and may be made in such a way as to help in the
calculation of an and bn. In practice, it is common to specify f(t) over either the period
−
 t 
or the period 0  t  T, leading respectively to the limits of integration
being −
and
(that is, d = −
) or 0 and T (that is, d = 0).
It is also worth noting that an alternative approach may simplify the calculation of
an and bn. Using the formula
e jnω t = cos nωt + jsinnωt
we have
an + jbn = 
d
d+T
f(t)e jnω tdt
(12.13)
Evaluating this integral and equating real and imaginary parts on each side gives the
values of an and bn. This approach is particularly useful when only the amplitude
| an + jbn | of the nth harmonic is required.

12.2.4
Functions of period 2p
If the period T of the periodic function f(t) is taken to be 2π then ω = 1, and the series
(12.3) becomes
(12.14)
with the coefﬁcients given by
an = 
d
d+2π
f(t)cosntdt
(n = 0, 1, 2, … )
(12.15)
bn = 
d
d+2π
f(t)sinntdt
(n = 1, 2, … )
(12.16)
While a unit frequency may rarely be encountered in practice, consideration of this par-
ticular case reduces the amount of mathematical manipulation involved in determining
the coefﬁcients an and bn. Also, there is no loss of generality in considering this case,
since if we have a function f(t) of period T, we may write t1 = 2πt/T, so that
where F(t1) is a function of period 2π. That is, by a simple change of variable, a 
periodic function f(t) of period T may be transformed into a periodic function F(t1) of
period 2π. Thus, in order to develop an initial understanding and to discuss some of the
properties of Fourier series, we shall ﬁrst consider functions of period 2π, returning to
functions of period other than 2π in Section 12.2.10.
Example 12.1
Obtain the Fourier series expansion of the periodic function f(t) of period 2π deﬁned by
f(t) = t
(0  t  2π),
f(t) = f(t + 2π)
Solution
A sketch of the function f(t) over the interval −4π  t  4π is shown in Figure 12.2. 
Since the function is periodic we only need to sketch it over one period, the pattern
being repeated for other periods. Using (12.15) to evaluate the Fourier coefﬁcients a0
and an gives
a0 = 

Equating real and imaginary parts gives, as before,
A periodic function f(t) may be speciﬁed in a piecewise fashion over a period, or,
indeed, it may only be piecewise-continuous over a period, as illustrated in Figure 12.4.
In order to calculate the Fourier coefﬁcients in such cases, it is necessary to break up
the range of integration in Euler’s formulae to correspond to the various components of
the function. For example, for the function shown in Figure 12.4, f(t) is deﬁned in the
interval −π  t  π by

INTRODUCTION TO FOURIER SERIES

12.2 FOURIER SERIES EXPANSION
963
Hence from (12.14) the Fourier series expansion of f(t) is
A major use of the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox and MAPLE, when dealing
with Fourier series, is to avoid the tedious and frequently error-prone integration
involved in determining the coefﬁcients an and bn. It is therefore advisable to use them
to check the accuracy of integration. To illustrate we shall consider Examples 12.2
and 12.3.
In MAPLE n may be declared to be an integer using the command
assume(n,integer);
which helps with simpliﬁcation of answers. There is no comparable command in
MATLAB so, when using the Symbolic Math Toolbox, we shall use the command
maple(‘assume (n,integer)’)
Considering Example 12.2 the MATLAB commands
syms t n
maple(‘assume (n,integer)’);
int((t^2 + t)*cos(n*t),–pi,pi)/pi
return the value of an as
4*(–1)^n/n^2
Entering the command pretty(ans) gives an in the form 4
, where n~
indicates that n is an integer. Likewise the commands
int((t^2 + t)*sin(n*t),–pi,pi)/pi;
pretty(ans)
returns bn as
-2
thus checking with the values given in the solution.
The corresponding commands in MAPLE are
assume(n,integer);
int((t^2 + t)*cos(n*t), t = –Pi..Pi)/Pi;
returning the value of an as

with the further command
int((t^2 + t)*sin(n*t), t = –Pi..Pi)/Pi;
returning the value of bn as
-2
again checking with the values given in the solution.
In Example 12.3 we are dealing with a piecewise function, which can be speciﬁed
using the piecewise command. In MATLAB the commands
syms t n
maple(‘assume (n,integer)’);
f = (‘PIECEWISE([t,t<= 1/2*pi], [1/2*pi,1/2*pi–t<= 0 and
t–pi< = 0],[pi–1/2t*t,pi<=t])’);
int(f*cos(n*t),0,2*pi)/pi;
pretty(ans)
return the value of an as
1/2
with the further commands
int(f*sin(n*t),0,2*pi)/pi;
pretty(ans)
returning the value of bn as
.
In MAPLE the commands
f:= simplify(piecewise(t<= Pi/2,t,(t>= Pi/2 and 
t<= Pi),Pi/2,t>= Pi,Pi–t/2));
ff:= unapply(f,t);
assume(n,integer);
an:= int(ff(t)*cos(n*t), t = 0..Pi)/Pi;
bn:= int(ff(t)*sin(n*t), t = 0..Pi)/Pi;
return the same values as MATLAB above for an and bn..
An alternative approach to using the piecewise command is to express the 
function in terms of Heaviside functions.

Even and odd functions
Noting that a particular function possesses certain symmetrical properties enables us
both to tell which terms are absent from a Fourier series expansion of the function and
to simplify the expressions determining the remaining coefﬁcients. In this section we
consider even and odd function symmetries, while in Section 12.2.6 we shall consider
symmetry due to even and odd harmonics.

First we review the properties of even and odd functions, considered in Section 2.2.6,
that are useful for determining the Fourier coefﬁcients. If f(t) is an even function then
f(t) = f(−t) for all t, and the graph of the function is symmetrical about the vertical axis,
as illustrated in Figure 12.6(a). From the deﬁnition of integration, it follows that if f(t)
is an even function then

a
−a
f(t)dt = 2
a
0
f(t)dt
If f(t) is an odd function then f(t) = −f(−t) for all t, and the graph of the function is
symmetrical about the origin; that is, there is opposite-quadrant symmetry, as illustrated
in Figure 12.6(b). It follows that if f(t) is an odd function then

a
−a
f(t)dt = 0
The following properties of even and odd functions are also useful for our purposes:
(a)
the sum of two (or more) odd functions is an odd function;
(b)
the product of two even functions is an even function;
(c)
the product of two odd functions is an even function;
(d)
the product of an odd and an even function is an odd function;
(e)
the derivative of an even function is an odd function;
(f)
the derivative of an odd function is an even function.
(Noting that t even is even and todd is odd helps one to remember (a)–(f).)
Using these properties, and taking d =
in (12.11) and (12.12), we have the 
following:
(i) If f(t) is an even periodic function of period T then
an = 
T/2

f(t)cosnωt dt = 

using property (b), and
bn = 

f(t)sin nωt dt = 0

In this section we consider types of symmetry that can be identiﬁed in order to elimin-
ate terms from the Fourier series expansion having even values of n (including n = 0)
or odd values of n.
(a) If a periodic function f(t) is such that
f(t +

then it has period T/2 and frequency ω = 2(2π/T), so only even harmonics are present
in its Fourier series expansion. For even n we have

The square wave of Example 12.4 is such that f(t + π) = −f(t), so that, from (b),
its Fourier series expansion consists of only odd harmonics. Since it is also an odd 
function, it follows that its Fourier series expansion consists only of odd-harmonic sine
terms, which is conﬁrmed by the result (12.21).
Example 12.6
Obtain the Fourier series expansion of the rectiﬁed sine wave
f(t) = | sin t |
Solution
A sketch of the wave over the interval −π  t  2π is shown in Figure 12.10. Clearly,
f(t + π) = f(t), so that only even harmonics are present in the Fourier series expansion.
Since the function is also an even function of t, it follows that the Fourier series expan-
sion will consist only of even-harmonic cosine terms. Taking T = 2π, that is ω = 1, in
(12.23), the coefﬁcients of the even harmonics are given by

Linearity property
The linearity property as applied to Fourier series may be stated in the form of the 
following theorem.
Theorem 12.1
If f(t) = lg(t) + mh(t), where g(t) and h(t) are periodic functions of period T and l and m
are arbitrary constants, then f(t) has a Fourier series expansion in which the coefﬁcients
are the sums of the coefﬁcients in the Fourier series expansions of g(t) and h(t) multi-
plied by l and m respectively.
Proof
Clearly f(t) is periodic with period T. If the Fourier series expansions of g(t) and h(t) are

Suppose that g(t) and h(t) are periodic functions of period 2π and are deﬁned within the
period −π  t  π by
g(t) = t 2,
h(t) = t
Determine the Fourier series expansions of both g(t) and h(t) and use the linearity prop-
erty to conﬁrm the expansion obtained in Example 12.2 for the periodic function f(t)
deﬁned within the period −π  t  π by f(t) = t 2 + t.

of h(t) = t is
(12.27)
Using the linearity property, we ﬁnd, by combining (12.12) and (12.27), that the Fourier
series expansion of f(t) = g(t) + h(t) = t 2 + t is
which conforms to the series obtained in Example 12.2.
12.2.8
Convergence of the Fourier series
So far we have concentrated our attention on determining the Fourier series expan-
sion corresponding to a given periodic function f(t). In reality, this is an exercise in 
integration, since we merely have to compute the coefﬁcients an and bn using Euler’s
formulae (12.11) and (12.12) and then substitute these values into (12.3). We have not
yet considered the question of whether or not the Fourier series thus obtained is a valid
representation of the periodic function f(t). It should not be assumed that the existence
of the coefﬁcients an and bn in itself implies that the associated series converges to the
function f(t).
A full discussion of the convergence of a Fourier series is beyond the scope of
this book and we shall conﬁne ourselves to simply stating a set of conditions which
ensures that f(t) has a convergent Fourier series expansion. These conditions, known as
Dirichlet’s conditions, may be stated in the form of Theorem 12.2.
Theorem 12.2
Dirichlet’s conditions
If f(t) is a bounded periodic function that in any period has
(a) a ﬁnite number of isolated maxima and minima, and
(b) a ﬁnite number of points of ﬁnite discontinuity
then the Fourier series expansion of f(t) converges to f(t) at all points where f(t) is 
continuous and to the average of the right- and left-hand limits of f(t) at points where
f(t) is discontinuous (that is, to the mean of the discontinuity).

INTRODUCTION TO FOURIER SERIES

12.2 FOURIER SERIES EXPANSION
973
Solution
(a) The function f(t) = 1/(3 −t) has an inﬁnite discontinuity at t = 3, which is within
the interval, and therefore does not satisfy the condition that f(t) must only have ﬁnite
discontinuities within a period (i.e. it is bounded).
(b) The function f(t) = sin[1/(t −2)] has an inﬁnite number of maxima and minima in
the neighbourbood of t = 2, which is within the interval, and therefore does not satisfy
the requirement that f(t) must have only a ﬁnite number of isolated maxima and minima
within one period.
The conditions of Theorem 12.2 are sufﬁcient to ensure that a representative Fourier
series expansion of f(t) exists. However, they are not necessary conditions for conver-
gence, and it does not follow that a representative Fourier series does not exist if they
are not satisﬁed. Indeed, necessary conditions on f(t) for the existence of a convergent
Fourier series are not yet known. In practice, this does not cause any problems, since
for almost all conceivable practical applications the functions that are encountered 
satisfy the conditions of Theorem 12.2 and therefore have representative Fourier series.
Another issue of importance in practical applications is the rate of convergence of
a Fourier series, since this is an indication of how many terms must be taken in the
expansion in order to obtain a realistic approximation to the function f(t) it represents.
Obviously, this is determined by the coefﬁcients an and bn of the Fourier series and the
manner in which these decrease as n increases.
In an example, such as Example 12.1, in which the function f(t) is only piecewise-
continuous, exhibiting jump discontinuities, the Fourier coefﬁcients decrease as 1/n,
and it may be necessary to include a large number of terms to obtain an adequate
approximation to f(t). In an example, such as Example 12.3, in which the function is 
a continuous function but has discontinuous ﬁrst derivatives (owing to the sharp 
corners), the Fourier coefﬁcients decrease as 1/n2, and so one would expect the series
to converge more rapidly. Indeed, this argument applies in general, and we may sum-
marize as follows:
(a)
if f(t) is only piecewise-continuous then the coefﬁcients in its Fourier series
representation decrease as 1/n;
(b)
if f(t) is continuous everywhere but has discontinuous ﬁrst derivatives then
the coefﬁcients in its Fourier series representation decrease as 1/n2;
(c)
if f(t) and all its derivatives up to that of the rth order are continuous but
the (r + 1)th derivative is discontinuous then the coefﬁcients in its Fourier
series representation decrease as 1/nr+2.
These observations are not surprising, since they simply tell us that the smoother the
function f(t), the more rapidly will its Fourier series representation converge.
To illustrate some of these issues related to convergence we return to Example 12.4,
in which the Fourier series (12.21) was obtained as a representation of the square wave
of Figure 12.7.
Since (12.21) is an inﬁnite series, it is clearly not possible to plot a graph of the
result. However, by considering ﬁnite partial sums, it is possible to plot graphs of
approximations to the series. Denoting the sum of the ﬁrst N terms in the inﬁnite series
by fN(t), that is

(12.28)
the graphs of fN(t) for N = 1, 2, 3 and 20 are as shown in Figure 12.11. It can be seen
that at points where f(t) is continuous the approximation of f(t) by fN(t) improves as N
increases, conﬁrming that the series converges to f(t) at all such points. It can also be
seen that at points of discontinuity of f(t), which occur at t = ±nπ (n = 0, 1, 2, … ), 
the series converges to the mean value of the discontinuity, which in this particular
example is
(−1 + 1) = 0. As a consequence, the equality sign in (12.21) needs to 
be interpreted carefully. Although such use may be acceptable, in the sense that the
series converges to f(t) for values of t where f(t) is continuous, this is not so at points
of discontinuity. To overcome this problem, the symbol ~ (read as ‘behaves as’ or 
‘represented by’) rather than = is frequently used in the Fourier series representation of
a function f(t), so that (12.21) is often written as
In the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics it is shown that
the Fourier series converges to f(t) in the sense that the integral of the square of the
difference between f(t) and fN(t) is minimized and tends to zero as N →∞.
We note that convergence of the Fourier series is slowest near a point of discon-
tinuity, such as the one that occurs at t = 0. Although the series does converge to 
the mean value of the discontinuity (namely zero) at t = 0, there is, as indicated in
Figure 12.11(d), an undershoot at t = 0−(that is, just to the left of t = 0) and an overshoot
at t = 0+ (that is, just to the right of t = 0). This non-smooth convergence of the Fourier
series leading to the occurrence of an undershoot and an overshoot at points of dis-
continuity of f(t) is a characteristic of all Fourier series representing discontinuous
functions, not only that of the square wave of Example 12.4, and is known as the Gibbs

phenomenon after the American physicist J. Willard Gibbs (1839–1903). The magnitude
of the undershoot/overshoot does not diminish as N →∞in (12.28), but simply gets
‘sharper’ and ‘sharper’, tending to a spike. In general, the magnitude of the undershoot
and overshoot together amount to about 18% of the magnitude of the discontinuity (that
is, the difference in the values of the function f(t) to the left and right of the discon-
tinuity). It is important that the existence of this phenomenon be recognized, since in
certain practical applications these spikes at discontinuities have to be suppressed by
using appropriate smoothing factors.
To reproduce the plots of Figure 12.11 and see how the series converges as N
increases, use the following MATLAB commands:
t=pi/100*[300:300];
f=0;
T=[-3*pi -2*pi -2*pi -pi -pi 0 0 pi pi 2*pi 2*pi 3*pi];
y=[-1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 1];
for n=1:20
f=f+4/pi*sin((2*n-1)*t)/(2*n-1);
plot(T,y,t,f,[-3*pi 3*pi],[0,0],‘k-’,[0,0], 
[-1.3 1.3],‘k-’)
axis([-3*pi,3*pi,-inf,inf]),pause
end
The pause command has been included to give you an opportunity to view the plots
at the end of each step. Press any key to proceed.
Theoretically, we can use the series (12.21) to obtain an approximation to π. This is
achieved by taking t = π, when f(t) = 1; (12.21) then gives
leading to
For practical purposes, however, this is not a good way of obtaining an approximation
to π, because of the slow rate of convergence of the series.

Functions of period T
Although all the results have been related to periodic functions having period T, all the
examples we have considered so far have involved periodic functions of period 2π. This
was done primarily for ease of manipulation in determining the Fourier coefﬁcients
while becoming acquainted with Fourier series. As mentioned in Section 12.2.4, func-
tions having unit frequency (that is, of period 2π) are rarely encountered in practice, and
in this section we consider examples of periodic functions having periods other than 2π.
Example 12.9
A periodic function f(t) of period 4 (that is, f(t + 4) = f(t)) is deﬁned in the range
−2  t  2 by

12.3
Functions deﬁned over a ﬁnite interval
One of the requirements of Fourier’s theorem is that the function to be expanded be
periodic. Therefore a function f(t) that is not periodic cannot have a Fourier series 
representation that converges to it for all values of t. However, we can obtain a Fourier
series expansion that represents a non-periodic function f(t) that is deﬁned only over 
a ﬁnite time interval 0  t  τ. This is a facility that is frequently used to solve prob-
lems in practice, particularly boundary-value problems involving partial differential
equations, such as the consideration of heat ﬂow along a bar or the vibrations of a
string. Various forms of Fourier series representations of f(t), valid only in the interval
0  t  τ, are possible, including series consisting of cosine terms only or series 
consisting of sine terms only. To obtain these, various periodic extensions of f(t) are
formulated.
12.3.1
Full-range series
Suppose the given function f(t) is deﬁned only over the ﬁnite time interval 0  t  τ.
Then, to obtain a full-range Fourier series representation of f(t) (that is, a series 
consisting of both cosine and sine terms), we deﬁne the periodic extension φ(t) of 
f(t) by
φ(t) = f(t)
(0  t  τ)
φ(t + τ) = φ(t)
The graphs of a possible f(t) and its periodic extension φ(t) are shown in Fig-
ures 12.17(a) and (b) respectively.
Provided that f(t) satisﬁes Dirichlet’s conditions in the interval 0  t  τ, the new
function φ(t), of period τ, will have a convergent Fourier series expansion. Since,
within the particular period 0  t  τ, φ(t) is identical to f(t), it follows that this Fourier
series expansion of φ(t) will be representative of f(t) within this interval.
Example 12.11
Find a full-range Fourier series expansion of f(t) = t valid in the ﬁnite interval 0  t  4.
Draw graphs of both f(t) and the periodic function represented by the Fourier series
obtained.
Solution
Deﬁne the periodic function φ(t) by
φ(t) = f(t) = t
(0  t  4)
φ(t + 4) = φ(t)

12.3 FUNCTIONS DEFINED OVER A FINITE INTERVAL
981
Then the graphs of f(t) and its periodic extension φ(t) are as shown in Figures 12.18(a)
and (b) respectively. Since φ(t) is a periodic function with period 4, it has a convergent
Fourier series expansion. Taking T = 4 in (12.11) and (12.12), the Fourier coefﬁcients
are determined as
a0 = 

(n = 1, 2, 3, … )
and
bn = 
4
0
f(t)sin nπt dt
(n = 1, 2, 3, … ) 
Thus, by (12.10), the Fourier series expansion of φ(t) is
Since φ(t) = f(t) for 0  t  4, it follows that this Fourier series is representative of f(t)
within this interval, so that
(12.29)
It is important to appreciate that this series converges to t only within the interval
0  t  4. For values of t outside this interval it converges to the periodic extended
function φ(t). Again convergence is to be interpreted in the sense of Theorem 12.2, so
that at the end points t = 0 and t = 4 the series does not converge to t but to the mean of
the discontinuity in φ(t), namely the value 2.

12.3.2
Half-range cosine and sine series
Rather than develop the periodic extension φ(t) of f(t) as in Section 12.3.1, it is 
possible to formulate periodic extensions that are either even or odd functions, so that
the resulting Fourier series of the extended periodic functions consist either of cosine
terms only or sine terms only.
For a function f(t) deﬁned only over the ﬁnite interval 0  t  τ its even periodic
extension F(t) is the even periodic function deﬁned by
F(t + 2τ) = f(t)
As an illustration, the even periodic extension F(t) of the function f(t) shown in Fig-
ure 12.17(a) (redrawn in Figure 12.19(a)) is shown in Figure 12.19(b).
Provided that f(t) satisﬁes Dirichlet’s conditions in the interval 0  t  τ, since it 
is an even function of period 2τ, it follows from Section 12.2.5 that the even periodic
extension F(t) will have a convergent Fourier series representation consisting of cosine
terms only and given by
(12.30)
where
an = 
τ
0
f(t)
(n = 0, 1, 2, … )
(12.31)
Since, within the particular interval 0  t  τ, F(t) is identical to f(t), it follows that the
series (12.30) also converges to f(t) within this interval.
For a function f(t) deﬁned only over the ﬁnite interval 0  t  τ, its odd periodic
extension G(t) is the odd periodic function deﬁned by
G(t + 2τ) = G(t)
Again, as an illustration, the odd periodic extension G(t) of the function f(t) shown in
Figure 12.17(a) (redrawn in Figure 12.20(a)) is shown in Figure 12.20(b).

12.3 FUNCTIONS DEFINED OVER A FINITE INTERVAL
983
Provided that f(t) satisﬁes Dirichlet’s conditions in the interval 0  t  τ, since it 
is an odd function of period 2τ, it follows from Section 12.2.5 that the odd periodic
extension G(t) will have a convergent Fourier series representation consisting of sine
terms only and given by
(12.32)
where
bn = 
τ
0
f(t)
(n = 1, 2, 3, … ) 
(12.33)
Again, since, within the particular interval 0  t  τ, G(t) is identical to f(t), it
follows that the series (12.32) also converges to f(t) within this interval.
We note that both the even and odd periodic extensions F(t) and G(t) are of period
2τ, which is twice the length of the interval over which f(t) is deﬁned. However, the
resulting Fourier series (12.30) and (12.32) are based only on the function f(t), and for
this reason are called the half-range Fourier series expansions of f(t). In particular,
the even half-range expansion F(t), (12.30), is called the half-range cosine series
expansion of f(t), while the odd half-range expansion G(t), (12.32), is called the half-
range sine series expansion of f(t).
Example 12.12
For the function f(t) = t deﬁned only in the interval 0  t  4, and considered in
Example 12.11, obtain
(a) a half-range cosine series expansion;
(b) a half-range sine series expansion.
Draw graphs of f(t) and of the periodic functions represented by the two series obtained
for −20  t  20.
Solution

It is important to realize that the three different Fourier series representations
(12.29), (12.34) and (12.35) are representative of the function f(t) = t only within the
deﬁned interval 0  t  4. Outside this interval the three Fourier series converge to the
three different functions φ(t), F(t) and G(t), illustrated in Figures 12.18(b), 12.21(b) and
12.21(c) respectively.

12.4 DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION OF FOURIER SERIES
987
12.4
Differentiation and integration of Fourier series
It is inevitable that the desire to obtain the derivative or the integral of a Fourier series
will arise in some applications. Since the smoothing effects of the integration process
tend to eliminate discontinuities, whereas the process of differentiation has the opposite
effect, it is not surprising that the integration of a Fourier series is more likely to be
possible than its differentiation. We shall not pursue the theory in depth here; rather we
shall state, without proof, two theorems concerned with the term-by-term integration
and differentiation of Fourier series, and make some observations on their use.
12.4.1
Integration of a Fourier series
Theorem 12.3
A Fourier series expansion of a periodic function f(t) that satisﬁes Dirichlet’s con-
ditions may be integrated term by term, and the integrated series converges to the
integral of the function f(t).
end of theorem
According to this theorem, if f(t) satisﬁes Dirichlet’s conditions in the interval
−π  t  π and has a Fourier series expansion
then for −π  t1  t  π
Because of the presence of the term
on the right-hand side, this is clearly not a
Fourier series expansion of the integral on the left-hand side. However, the result can
be rearranged to be a Fourier series expansion of the function
g(t) =
f(t)dt −
Example 12.13 serves to illustrate this process. Note also that the Fourier coefﬁcients
in the new Fourier series are −bn/n and an/n, so, from the observations made in Section
12.2.8, the integrated series converges faster than the original series for f(t). If the
given function f(t) is piecewise-continuous, rather than continuous, over the interval
−π  t  π then care must be taken to ensure that the integration process is carried out
properly over the various subintervals. Again, Example 12.14 serves to illustrate this
point.

Example 12.13
From Example 12.5, the Fourier series expansion of the function
f(t) = t 2
(−π  t  π),
f(t + 2π) = f(π)
is
Integrating this result between the limits −π and t gives
that is,
Because of the term
on the right-hand side, this is clearly not a Fourier series
expansion. However, rearranging, we have
and now the right-hand side may be taken to be the Fourier series expansion of the 
function
g(t) = t 3 −π 2t
(−π  t  π)
g(t + 2π) = g(t)

Integrate term by term the Fourier series expansion obtained in Example 12.4 for the
square wave
f(t + 2π) = f(t)

We now need to integrate between the limits −π and t and, owing to the discontinuity
in f(t) at t = 0, we must consider separately values of t in the intervals −π  t  0 and
0  t  π.
Case (i), interval −π  t  0. Integrating (12.21) term by term, we have

12.4.2
Differentiation of a Fourier series
Theorem 12.4
If f(t) is a periodic function that satisﬁes Dirichlet’s conditions then its derivative f′(t),
wherever it exists, may be found by term-by-term differentiation of the Fourier series
of f(t) if and only if the function f(t) is continuous everywhere and the function f ′(t) has
a Fourier series expansion (that is, f ′(t) satisﬁes Dirichlet’s conditions).
end of theorem
It follows from Theorem 12.4 that if the Fourier series expansion of f(t) is differ-
entiable term by term then f(t) must be periodic at the end points of a period (owing to
the condition that f(t) must be continuous everywhere). Thus, for example, if we are
dealing with a function f(t) of period 2π and deﬁned in the range −π  t  π then we
must have f(−π) = f(π). To illustrate this point, consider the Fourier series expansion
of the function
f(t) = t
(−π  t  π)
f(t + 2π) = f(t)
which, from Example 12.7, is given by
f(t) = 2(sin t −
2t +
3t −
4t + … )
Differentiating term by term, we have
f ′(t) = 2(cos t −cos2t + cos3t −cos4t + … )
If this differentiation process is valid then f′(t) must be equal to unity for −π  t  π.
Clearly this is not the case, since the series on the right-hand side does not converge for
any value of t. This follows since the nth term of the series is 2(−1)n+1 cos nt and does
not tend to zero as n →∞.
If f(t) is continuous everywhere and has a Fourier series expansion
then, from Theorem 12.4, provided that f ′(t) satisﬁes the required conditions, its
Fourier series expansion is
In this case the Fourier coefﬁcients of the derived expansion are nbn and nan, so, in
contrast to the integrated series, the derived series will converge more slowly than the
original series expansion for f(t).
Example 12.15
Consider the process of differentiating term by term the Fourier series expansion of the
function
f(t) = t 2
(−π  t  π),
f(t + 2π) = f(t)

Solution
From Example 12.5, the Fourier series expansion of f(t) is
Since f(t) is continuous within and at the end points of the interval −π  t  π, we may
apply Theorem 12.4 to obtain
which conforms to the Fourier series expansion obtained for the function

Figure 12.24 Slider–crank mechanism.
12.5
Engineering application: analysis of a slider–crank
mechanism
Figure 12.24(a) represents a slider–crank mechanism. The crank OP rotates about O,
and P is connected to Q, which is constrained so that it slides along OB. A special case
when OP = 1 m and PQ = 3 m is shown in Figure 12.24(b). The distance OQ is x when
the angle QOP is θ and is given by (see Example 2.44)
x(θ) = cosθ + ÷(9 −sin2θ)
Here we recap the work of Section 8.12 and extend it to illustrate a general result con-
cerning Fourier series.
It is clear, both from the basic geometry of the mechanism and from the formula for
x, that x(θ) is an even periodic function. This implies it can be represented by a Fourier
series of the form
x(θ) = a0 + a1cosθ + a2cos2θ + a3 cos3θ + … 
Such mechanisms usually form parts of larger pieces of equipment, so it is important
to know the sizes of the coefﬁcients ak during the design process to avoid dangerous
motions due to resonance.
The process of obtaining the values of the coefﬁcients ak is called harmonic ana-
lysis. Truncating the Fourier series, we can obtain an approximation to x(θ) in the form
x(θ)  a0 + a1cosθ + a2cos2θ + a3cos3θ + a4cos4θ
We wish to determine the values of a0, … , a4 so that we obtain the best approximation
possible. We achieve this by choosing a0, … , a4 in such a way that the total squared
error over a complete period is a minimum. Because x(θ) is an even function, this 
simpliﬁes to ﬁnding the values of a0, … , a4 that minimize the integral

Taking the case k = 0, this yields

Similarly, ∂I/∂a1 = 0 gives

proximation’ for x(θ) in the form

We could continue the process to ﬁnd a5 and a6. Notice that the coefﬁcients are just those
found by the standard formulae for the coefﬁcients of a Fourier series so that we do not
have to go through the above minimizing process every time. Indeed the example can
be generalized to show that the truncated Fourier series provides the ‘best’ approxi-
mation to a periodic function.
Using the trapezium rule the MATLAB commands
a = 0; b = pi/2; n = 8;h = (b – a)/n; x = (a:h:b);
y = 2.*((9 – (sin(x)).^2).^(1/2))./pi;
h*trapz(y)
return the answer 2.9148.
Likewise the commands
a = 0; b = pi; n = 8; h = (b-a)/n; x = (a:h:b);
y = 2.*cos(2.*x).*((9 – (sin(x)).^2).^(1/2))./pi;
h*trapz(y)
return the answer 0.0858.
and the commands
a = 0;b = pi; n = 8; h = (b – a)/n; x = (a:h:b);
y = 2.*cos(4.*x).*((9 – (sin(x)).^2).^(1/2))./pi;
h*trapz(y)
return the answer –6.3119e – 004.

An interesting alternative approach is to attempt to evaluate the integrals in 
symbolic form. Using the Symbolic Math Toolbox the integrals can be evaluated
symbolically, with some of the answers expressed in terms of elliptic functions.
Using the double command, all answers can be expressed in numeric form. For
example, considering the integral for a0 the commands
syms x y
y = 2*cos(2*x)*sqrt(9 – (sin(x))^2)/pi;
int(y,0,pi);
double(ans)
return the answer 0.0858.

13.1
Introduction
Many events in our lives are subject to chance – by which we mean that they are not
entirely predictable. To some extent, we can choose where we live and what sort of
work we do, but even so we cannot be sure what sort of neighbours or workmates we
shall have: noisy, generous, friendly and so on. In a similar way, experiments in all
branches of science and engineering involve unpredictable outcomes that may be
expressed either as a quality such as ‘turned green’ or ‘exploded’, or numerically in
terms of mass, resistance or any standard unit. In contrast with everyday life, an ‘experi-
ment’ is repeated many times, so that the limited predictability of the various outcomes
can emerge as a pattern within the disorder. The subject of statistics is about extracting
that pattern and drawing useful conclusions from it, and the theoretical foundation for
this is contained in the theory of probability.
Engineers, in particular, are immersed in data throughout their working lives. The term
‘data’ is used rather loosely to refer to numerical information of all kinds, including for
example the speciﬁcation of a machine or part. For our present purposes, however, we
shall use data to refer to the set of measured outcomes of an experiment. Engineering
is a discipline founded upon experiment, and engineers need to know how to process
their experimental data and how to assess the results of others’ experiments.
The aim of statistics is to extract useful information from the data. This information
can take many forms. If the aim of an experiment is to assist with the making of a 
decision then the people conducting the experiment will have in mind a question to
which they would like the answer, and ideally the question (and its possible answers)
will be expressed as simply and clearly as possible in ordinary language. On the other
hand, the aim of an experiment may be to calibrate an instrument or to measure some
unknown quantity, in which case the conclusions of the experiment will be numerical.
Sometimes all that is needed is to plot the data in a suitable way that makes the
message clear. The information is then conveyed in graphical form to the reader. 
Unfortunately, it very often turns out that the data are rather ambiguous, the conclusions
are not obvious and the data must be analysed in a more mathematical way. In this case
the conclusion (which relates directly to the purpose of the experiment) cannot be stated
with 100% conﬁdence. This issue is taken up in the companion text Advanced Modern
Engineering Mathematics, where the mathematical methods of statistics are introduced.
In the present chapter we shall see how the data may be plotted to good effect, and then
go on to cover the essential probability theory without which the proper statistical prac-
tices (in engineering and elsewhere) would be impossible.
Whilst MATLAB and MAPLE have some statistical functionality there are special-
ist statistical packages, such as Minitab, that are more appropriate for use in the teaching
of statistical work. Consequently, MATLAB and MAPLE commands are not developed
in this chapter. Almost all the statistical calculations in this chapter could also be car-
ried out using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. In addition, the statistical
package R, which is available on the web (http://www.r-project.org), is increasingly
popular and runs on a variety of platforms.

13.2 THE RAW MATERIAL OF STATISTICS
1001
13.2
The raw material of statistics
13.2.1
Experiments and sampling
A statistician requires data to work on, and data are usually obtained by experiment – 
but not any old experiment will do. The most common type of statistical experiment
involves taking a sample from a population and drawing some conclusions about
the whole population from the results for the sample. In general, in statistical work the
population that is the object of study is assumed to be very large and rather uniform
with respect to certain characteristics of interest. The sample that is drawn for investi-
gation is much smaller. The size of the sample governs the conﬁdence with which
statements about the characteristics of the population can be made.
Ideally, the entire population would be studied, but this may be impractical for 
reasons of expense, ethics or destructiveness of tests:
(a)
Expense: the population may be too large or the cost per individual may be
high.
(b)
Ethics: in medical experiments involving animals or people the aim is to use
the smallest sample size that is compatible with obtaining a dependable result.
(c)
Destructiveness: destructive testing of components, for example, breaking stress
or lifetime, obviously precludes using the whole population.
The quality of the sample is also important. Imagine an opinion poll in which all
the people interviewed were professional engineers. The results would be of interest to
someone investigating the voting intentions of this particular group, but such a poll
might be a poor indicator of the result of the next general election. Now imagine 
an opinion poll conducted in a large hall, with a microphone passed from person to
person. The intimidating nature of this situation would prevent many respondents from
giving a truthful answer, particularly if the poll involved politically, socially or morally
sensitive issues. These two examples demonstrate the fundamental requirements of any
sampling experiment, including an opinion poll: the sample must be representative
and successive observations must be independent.
13.2.2
Histograms of data
After gathering the data together, the ﬁrst step is often to display it graphically using 
a histogram or pie chart. Computer packages are often very useful for this. For example,
Figure 13.1 contains some data describing the performance of two prototype car
engines: a series of running times (in minutes at constant speed on 1 litre of standard
fuel) and ambient temperatures at the times of the tests, for each engine. Two questions
that are easy to state, and which might be answerable from this data, are
(a)
Is the fuel consumption of one engine different from that of the other?
(b)
Does fuel consumption depend upon ambient temperature?
These questions are actually related, as can be seen in Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics, where this example is discussed at some length. For the moment, we shall
see what can be learned just by plotting the data.

The ﬁrst thing to observe is that the measured running times are rather erratic, even
taking temperature into account. The six tests of engine A at 18°C produced results
ranging from 23.7min to 26.9min. This situation is typical, and is not necessarily the
result of sloppy experimental practice or inaccurate equipment (though such failings
should not be condoned where they are easily avoided). There are practical limitations
on the design and conduct of experiments that preclude making measurements to
ultimate precision, and mean that certain causal factors that might inﬂuence the results
are not measured at all. In this series of engine tests the actual quantity of fuel would
have varied a little around 1 litre, the condition of the engine oil would have been
different from one test to another, and so on.
Figures 13.2(a) and (b) are histograms of the running times for engines A and B
respectively. The data have been grouped into classes, and the height of each bar indic-
ates the number in the class. Values falling on a boundary are counted in the upper
class. The width of each bar is the same, and is chosen to reveal the overall shape of the
data. A histogram with too many small classes is very erratic, whereas one with too few
large classes has no structure. It is typical for a histogram to span the data with about
eight to ten classes.
Figure 13.2(c) shows the two histograms superimposed. It is fairly clear that there is
a difference here, and that the running times for engine B tend to be longer than those
for engine A. However, just from the histograms, it is difﬁcult to be precise about the
amount of the difference, or to assess the conﬁdence with which one could state that a
difference exists.
Figure 13.3 contains corresponding histograms for the temperatures. This time the
results are much more similar. It is easy to imagine that if a relatively small subset of
the sample had given different results from those obtained then there would have been
no difference at all between the histograms. This difference could therefore be attrib-
uted to chance.

13.2 THE RAW MATERIAL OF STATISTICS
1003
Somewhere in between these two situations is one for which a difference just exists
but is not obvious. It is in dealing with this type of situation (which is quite common)
that the powerful mathematical discipline of statistics is important. No analysis of the
data will deﬁnitely settle the question of whether or not the populations differ, but the
extent of the evidence for a difference can be assessed, and this may be invaluable if a
decision has to be made.

13.2.3
Alternative types of plot
Histograms are the most common types of data plot, but there are many others. For
example, when data are grouped into classes, there is inevitably some loss of informa-
tion. This can be avoided by using a stem-and-leaf plot, which is similar to a histogram
except that the individual values are retained. The idea is for the leading digits in the
sample values to form a stem (one per class), with the remaining digits entering the bar
as a leaf. The length of the bar is simply the number of sample values with that stem.
Figure 13.4 contains stem-and-leaf plots for the running time data for engines A and B
(Figure 13.1). The * in the stem shows where the leaf digit goes. The similarity of these
plots to the histograms in Figure 13.2 is clear.
The main disadvantages of stem-and-leaf plots are that they are less suitable for
large samples, they are more difﬁcult to superimpose to detect differences, and there is
less ﬂexibility in choosing the classes. The stem can be split or several stems conjoined,
but the main constraint is that ten is divisible only by two and ﬁve. (Try drawing a stem-
and-leaf plot for the temperature data in Figure 13.1.)
Another useful device is the cumulative percentage plot, which shows for any
value what proportion of observations were less than that value. This can be drawn up
from the original data, but is more easily inferred from a histogram of classes by suc-
cessively adding the class sizes and dividing by the total number of observations.
Figure 13.5 contains such a table for the temperature data for engine A in Figure 13.1.
The cumulative percentage is plotted in Figure 13.6(a). The S shape is typical for plots
like this. Sometimes a special kind of graph paper is used for which the probability

scale is nonlinear, as shown in Figure 13.6(b). This is known as normal probability
paper, and is useful for testing whether the data have a particularly important kind of
proﬁle called the normal distribution, which will be introduced in Section 13.5.3. If the
data are normal, the plot should ﬁt a straight line.
The presentation of data (often using sophisticated graphics) is very important in
communicating results, and is often referred to as descriptive statistics. In Advanced
Modern Engineering Mathematics we introduce inferential statistics. This means
using mathematical methods to analyse the data with a view to answering certain
important questions. Inferential statistics is more powerful than descriptive statistics
because of the capacity to extract conclusions and quote the conﬁdence with which 
they are asserted. In the rest of this chapter the necessary theory of probability will be
covered so that the statistical methods can be built upon it.

Probabilities of random events
13.3.1
Interpretations of probability
The theory of probability underlies the methods of inference used in statistical situ-
ations, and the concept of probability can be related to the histogram of data. The height
of each bar determines the proportion of the sample that fell into the corresponding
class. One way to think of probability is to assume that as a larger and larger sample
is taken (ignoring the practical objections raised in Section 13.2.1), the histogram will
stabilize and the class proportions will converge to the ‘true’ probability ﬁgures. This
concept of probability is of an objective quantity that applies to each observation and
measures (in a relative way) how likely it is to fall into the corresponding class. Like
the speed of sound and the density of gold, it is known only imperfectly because of our
limited capacity to do experiments.
An alternative concept of probability that is important in decision-making and expert
systems involves degree of belief. This is highly subjective, because it will depend
upon the individual (or group) concerned and will vary with past experience. This
seems unscientiﬁc at ﬁrst sight, and there is much resistance to this notion, but there are
many situations where experiments are unrepeatable in principle and no ‘large-sample
proportion’ approach is applicable. The outcome of an election is uncertain, and it
is not unreasonable to say that some outcomes are ‘more probable’ than others, but the

13.3 PROBABILITIES OF RANDOM EVENTS
1007
actual election can take place only once. It seems that one is forced into a subjective
view of the uncertainties, but the probability ﬁgures that emerge must obey certain rules
in order to be consistent. Advocates of subjective probability have shown that these
rules are the same as those obeyed by the sample proportions.
The formal theory of probability admits a number of ‘interpretations’, of which these
objective and subjective interpretations are by far the most important. For engineering
students it is most appropriate to keep the ﬁrst interpretation – that of probability as an
idealized proportion – in mind when studying the theory.
13.3.2
Sample space and events
The ﬁrst step is to introduce some terminology that allows us to be clear in describing
what is observed in an experiment. The language used is that of set theory, introduced
in Chapter 6, because this provides a natural way of describing how observed events
combine and separate.
Let the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment be called the sample space
and denote it by S. An event is any subset of S. One (initially unspeciﬁed) outcome is
considered to be the actual outcome, and an event is said to occur if it contains the
actual outcome.
Example 13.1
If the experiment is to roll an ordinary six-faced die and observe the numerical value
of the outcome then the sample space will be the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The event ‘the
outcome is an even number’ will be represented by the set {2, 4, 6}. If the actual
outcome is a 5 then the event ‘the outcome is an even number’ has not occurred,
because 5  {2, 4, 6}.
Example 13.2
If the experiment is to toss a fair coin twice then the sample space may be represented as
the set {HH, HT, TH, TT}. The event ‘both tosses yield the same result’ is represented
by the set {HH, TT}. If the actual outcome is TT then the event ‘both tosses yield the
same result’ has occurred, because TT  {HH, TT}.
The sample space S therefore contains everything that can occur, and may be dis-
crete or continuous. It is discrete if the possible outcomes can be written as a list: for
instance, for somebody’s birthday S = {1 January, 2 January, … , 31 December}. The
list does not need to be ﬁnite. Continuous sample spaces arise when experiments
involve measurements of some continuous variable such as a person’s height or the
voltage in a circuit. Then parentheses (rather than curly brackets) are used to denote an
open interval such as S = (0, 10), and square brackets to denote a closed interval (see
Section 1.2.5). Of course we can only measure to limited precision in practice, so the
possible values could be listed, but this is a rather arbitrary technical limitation.
Events are what we observe, in general. It is not always necessary – and for a con-
tinuous observation it is impossible – to know the actual outcome. If you want to send
someone a birthday card then it is sufﬁcient to know that her birthday occurs ‘about 
the end of June’. Events range from S itself (the certain event) to the empty set ∅
(the impossible event). Most interesting events are in-between: neither certain nor
impossible, but with a reasonable chance of containing the actual outcome.

The usual operations of set theory (Section 6.2) apply to events. If A and B are events
then so are the following:
(a)
union: A  B corresponding to ‘A or B occurs’;
(b)
intersection: A  B corresponding to ‘A and B occur’;
(c)
complement: S −A corresponding to ‘not-A occurs’.
The complement of A is also written A.
Using this language, it is possible to describe situations in which at least one of two
events occurs (union), or where both events occur (intersection), or where an event fails
to occur (complement). Since so much of our everyday experience is structured in this
way, this should be a fairly natural starting-point for the theory.
13.3.3
Axioms of probability
The next step is to associate a real number P(A) with each event A  S, called the
probability of that event. (Strictly speaking, assigning probabilities to arbitrary subsets
of a continuous sample space is not possible, but there are ways around this and we shall
ignore this technical limitation here.) These numbers must satisfy the rules prompted
by the interpretations discussed in Section 13.3.1. The following three rules are referred
to as the axioms of probability, and lay the foundation for the whole theory:
(1)
The certain event S has probability one: P(S) = 1.
(2)
All probabilities are non-negative: P(A)  0.
(3)
Addition rule: if A and B are disjoint events (so that A  B = ∅) then 
P(A  B) = P(A) + P(B)
If probability is regarded as an idealized proportion then clearly its maximum value
must be one, it must be non-negative, and the addition rule describes how proportions
behave in exclusive situations: for instance, if 5% of units of a brand of power supply
produce a voltage that is too low and 8% produce a voltage that is too high then the
proportion that produces a voltage that is either too low or too high must be 13%. The
three axioms are therefore exactly what we should intuitively expect. What is remark-
able is that they are also sufﬁcient. Further rules of probability follow from the axioms:
(4)
Complement rule: P(S −A) = 1 −P(A).
(5)
P(∅) = 0.
(6)
If A  B then P(A)  P(B).
(7)
General addition rule:
P(A  B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A  B)
The complement rule (4) follows immediately from axioms (1) and (3) using the fact
that a set does not intersect with its complement:
P(A  A) = P(S) = 1 = P(A) + P(A)
1008
DATA HANDLING AND PROBABILITY THEORY

13.3 PROBABILITIES OF RANDOM EVENTS
1009
The general addition rule (7) can be illustrated using a Venn diagram, as in Figure 13.7.
Imagine the probability as a unit mass, spread out (unevenly) over S. Because of the
overlap between A and B, adding their probabilities makes the probability of the inter-
section contribute twice to the total, so this has to be subtracted to compensate.
Example 13.3
A fair six-sided die is tossed. Find the probability of the event ‘even number or number
less than four’.
Solution
The sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, with all values equally likely. Since
P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6) must sum to one, we must have
P(1) = P(2) = … = P(6) =
The various events are shown in Figure 13.8. Using the general addition rule,
P(even or less than four) = P(even) + P(less than four)
− P(even number less than four)
= P({2, 4, 6}) + P({1, 2, 3}) −P({2})
=
This result also follows from the complement rule:
P({1, 2, 3, 4, 6}) = P(not {5}) = 1 −P({5}) =

Example 13.4
During the assessment of a class of students, 80% passed the examination in mathe-
matics, 85% passed in laboratory work, and 75% passed both. For a student chosen at 
random from the class, ﬁnd the probabilities that the student
(a) passed in either mathematics or laboratory work;
(b) passed in mathematics but failed laboratory work;
(c) failed in both.
Solution
Let M and L denote passes in mathematics and laboratory work respectively.
(a) By the general addition rule,
P(M  L) = P(M) + P(L) −P(M  L) = 0.8 + 0.85 −0.75 = 0.9
(b) The group of students who passed in mathematics consists of those who passed in
both together with those who passed in mathematics but failed in laboratory work, so that
P(M  L) = P(M) −P(M  L) = 0.8 −0.75 = 0.05
(c) De Morgan’s law (Section 6.2.4, equations (6.7)), together with the result of (a),
gives
P(M  L) = 1 −P(M  L) = 1 −0.9 = 0.1
13.3.4
Conditional probability
Information sometimes arrives in stages, and this happens whenever the outcome of one
experiment (or part of an experiment) is relevant to another outcome subsequent to it.
For example, the outcome of a seismic survey tells an oil company something about the
chances of ﬁnding oil if a well is drilled in a certain area, but has no direct causal
inﬂuence on that discovery. Sometimes a causal inﬂuence does exist, as in the case
(mentioned in Section 13.2.1) of an opinion poll or vote conducted in a large hall with
a microphone passed from person to person. In such circumstances there is strong
psychological pressure on individuals to go along with the majority. This is very
undesirable in statistical sampling because it can result in a serious bias, so one of the
essential features of a sample is independence. This requires that future outcomes
should not depend upon past or present outcomes, but ﬁrst we need to express the
possibility of dependence in general probability terms.
From the start, all probabilities are probabilities of events (see Section 13.3.3), so
suppose in general that an event A is known to have occurred (representing the existing
information). The probabilities of possible future events are now measured relative to
the fact that A has occurred. This event must therefore encompass all possibilities com-
patible with the known information, and can effectively be regarded as a new, revised,
sample space in the light of that information. This is the key to understanding the
deﬁnition and examples that follow.

This represents the new probability of B given that A has occurred, and depends upon
the probability of the intersection as shown in Figure 13.9.
Example 13.5
Someone tosses a die, covers it up and tells you that the number shown is less than four.
How does this change the probability that the number is even?
Solution
From the deﬁnition,
The information that the number is less than four causes the sample space to shrink to
{1, 2, 3}, and only one entry in this set is even. The outcomes are equally likely, so the
probability that the number is even drops from one-half to one-third.
Example 13.6
The probability that a regularly scheduled ﬂight departs on time is P(D) = 0.83, the
probability that it arrives on time is P(A) = 0.92, and the probability that it both departs
and arrives on time is P(A  D) = 0.78. Find the probability that a plane
(a) arrives on time given that it departed on time;
(b) did not depart on time given that it fails to arrive on time.
Solution
(a) This is straightforward from the deﬁnition:
P(arrives on time | departed on time) = P(A | D)
(b) First, using De Morgan’s law (Section 6.2.4, equations (6.7)), we have
P(A  D) = 1 −P(A  D)

by the general addition rule (7). Hence
P(did not depart on time | does not arrive on time)
= P(D | A)
= 0.375
In a sense it is cheating to refer to a conditional ‘probability’ until it is clear that this
quantity actually satisﬁes the axioms of probability. It is a useful exercise to show that
this is the case. Consider the three axioms in turn:
(1)
The event A can be considered as the new sample space, and
(2)
P(B | A)  0
because
P(A  B)  0
and
P(A)  0
(3)
If B  C = ∅
then
(B  A)  (C  A) = ∅,
and so
P[(B  A)  (C  A)] = P(B  A) + P(C  A)
Since
(B  A)  (C  A) = (B  C)  A
we have that
= P(B| A) + P(C | A)
So conditional probability satisﬁes the axioms and therefore the various further rules
such as the complement rule (4) and the general addition rule (7). Also, because a
conditional probability is itself a probability, it is possible to conditionalize again. Thus
if the probabilities in the deﬁnition are all conditioned upon another event C, we have
Example 13.7
Suppose that on a small tropical island there are only two kinds of day: sunny days and
rainy days. The probability that a sunny day is followed by a rainy day is 0.6, and the
probability that a rainy day is followed by another rainy day is 0.8. The weather on any
day depends upon the previous day’s weather but not upon any earlier days. Find the
probability that if Thursday is rainy then it will be sunny on Saturday.

DATA HANDLING AND PROBABILITY THEORY

13.3 PROBABILITIES OF RANDOM EVENTS
1013
Solution
Let T, F and S denote the events that Thursday, Friday and Saturday are sunny respect-
ively (see Figure 13.10). All probabilities must be conditioned upon the assumption that
Thursday is rainy. The ﬁrst step is
P(S | T) = P(S  F | T) + P(S  F | T)
because conditional probabilities obey the addition rule. Also,
P(S  F | T) = P(S | F  T)P(F | T)
from the deﬁnition. Now
P(F | T) = P(sunny | rainy)
= 1 −0.8 = 0.2
because conditional probabilities obey the complement rule. The assumption that the
inﬂuence of the weather does not extend beyond the previous day implies that
P(S | F  T) = P(S | F) = P(sunny | sunny)
= 1 −0.6 = 0.4
(This is known as independence, and is described in Section 13.3.5.) Similarly,
P(S  F | T) = P(S | F  T)P(F | T)
= P(S | F)P(F | T)
= P(sunny | rainy)P(rainy | rainy)
= (1 −0.8)(0.8)
Thus
P(S | T ) = (0.2)(0.4) + (0.2)(0.8) = 0.24
which is the answer required.
We shall not use conditional probabilities very much in this chapter, but the idea of a
probability that is conditional upon another event is pervasive. For the moment, how-
ever, we must use conditional probability (rather paradoxically) to express the absence
of interaction between the events.

13.3.5
Independence
It is possible for the probability of an event B to be raised, lowered or left unchanged
by the information that another event A has occurred. For the events shown in 
Figure 13.11, B1 is a subset of A and B2 is disjoint from A, so that

The probability of B3 could go either way, or remain unchanged, depending on the 
probability of the intersection. The situation where the probability is unchanged assumes
a special importance.
Events A and B are called independent when
P(B| A) = P(B)
In this situation A conveys effectively no information about B. From the deﬁnition of
conditional probability in Section 13.3.4 it follows that
P(A  B) = P(A)P(B)
The joint probability is the product of the separate probabilities. This shows that
independence is symmetric between the two events, so we also have
P(A| B) = P(A)

Items from a production line can have defects A or B. Some items have both, some
just one, but most have neither. Tables (a) and (b) show two alternative sets of joint

13.3 PROBABILITIES OF RANDOM EVENTS
1015
Solution
The row and column totals shown in the tables are the respective probabilities for the
two defects individually, for example
P(A  B) + P(A  B) = P(A)
and these ﬁgures are the same for both tables. It is easy to see that independence holds
for (a) but not for (b); for example, the probability of both defects together is
P(A  B) = 0.02 = P(A)P(B)
for (a)
but
P(A  B) = 0.06  P(A)P(B)
for (b)
The probability of the combination is greater in (b) than would be expected from the
product of the separate probabilities, which suggests that the two defects are causally
related in some way.
In general, for any number of independent events the probabilities multiply:
P(A1  A2  …  An) = P(A1)P(A2) … P(An)
This is called the product rule and must be distinguished from the addition rule, which
applies (in its basic form, axiom (3)) to exclusive events. Independent events cannot be
exclusive unless the probability of at least one of them is zero.
Example 13.9
A card is selected at random from an ordinary pack of 52 playing cards. Find the 
probabilities that the card drawn is
(a) an ace and a club,
(b) an ace or a club,
(c) an ace and a king,
(d) an ace or a king.
Solution
Let the events that the card is an ace, king and club be denoted by A, K and C
respectively.
(a) The events that the card is an ace and that it is a club are independent because there
are the same numbers of cards for each suit. These events are not exclusive unless the
ace of clubs happens to be missing. Thus
P(A  C) = P(A)P(C)
(b) The general addition rule for events (Section 13.3.3) gives
P(A  C) = P(A) + P(C) −P(A  C)
(c) The events that the card is an ace and that it is a king are mutually exclusive, so
P(A  K) = 0

Example 13.10
If two fair dice are tossed, ﬁnd the probability of at least one six occurring.
Solution
We shall assume that the throws are causally independent, in that the outcome for one
die does not relate in any way to the outcome for the other. They will then be statistic-
ally independent, and, by the complement and product rules,
P(at least one six) = 1 −P(no six)
= 1 −P(ﬁrst die not six)P(second die not six)
Example 13.11
If n people are independently selected, how large does n have to be before there is a 
better than even chance that at least two of them have the same birthday (not neces-
sarily in the same year and ruling out February 29th)? Assume that all possibilities are
equally likely.
Solution
The method of solution to this problem is similar to that for Example 13.10.
P(at least two with the same birthday)
= 1 −P(all different birthdays)
= 1 −P(2nd different from 1st)P(3rd different from 1st and 2nd)
… P(nth different from 1st, … , (n −1)th)
= 0.507
when n = 23
Many people are surprised to ﬁnd that the answer to Example 13.11 is so small, but this
shows that our subjective expectations sometimes have to give way when the rules of
probability are properly applied.
In connection with this example, a number of fallacies that ‘appear to be most 
prevalent and injurious to the susceptible gambler’ have been identiﬁed (R. A. Epstein, 
The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Academic Press, New York, 1977, 
p. 393), among which is
A tendency to interpret the probability of successive independent events as
additive rather than multiplicative. Thus the chance of throwing a given
number on a die is considered twice as large with two throws as it is with
a single throw.
The addition and product rules apply in different circumstances and must not be
confused.

Introduction and deﬁnition
Now that the foundation of probability theory has been laid, we can begin to consider
the data that originates in typical experiments – in particular, numerical data from obser-
vations of random variables. It is quite possible for non-numerical outcomes to be of
interest, for instance in an experiment where a machine’s possible faults might consist
of the set {overheated, jammed, misaligned}. Even then, the experiment is likely to
be repeated a number of times, and the count for each outcome gives rise to numerical
data that can be treated statistically. For the moment, however, let us assume that the
outcomes themselves take numerical values.
A random variable consists of a sample space of possible numerical values together
with a probability over those values.
Random variables vary in their degree of advance predictability. As the following
four examples show, the probabilities of the possible values are very dispersed for some
random variables, but highly concentrated for others:
(a)
The toss of a die. No die is perfect, but for this random variable the probabil-
ities of the six values are almost equal.
(b)
Next month’s rainfall. Unless you live in a part of the world that has a very
constant climate, the amount of rain that falls in March, say, varies from year
to year quite considerably. The probabilities are not quite so dispersed as for
the die toss, but there is a high degree of uncertainty.
(c)
A ﬂight delay. Here there is a high probability of at most a short delay, but
a small probability of a very long delay. The probabilities are relatively 
concentrated.

(d)
The time of tomorrow’s sunrise. Knowing your latitude, longitude, altitude, the
date, the direction of sunrise and the height above sea level of the horizon in
that direction, you could predict the time very precisely. There would be some
small uncertainty because of atmospheric refraction.
The behaviour of a random variable is determined by the proﬁle of its probability
distribution. We shall now enlarge upon this for the two common types. The notation
convention is to denote a random variable by a capital letter, say X, and an observed
value by the corresponding lower-case letter, then x.
13.4.2
Discrete random variables
The distinction between discrete and continuous random variables is inherited from that
for sample spaces (Section 13.3.2). First we shall consider the discrete case.
The random variable X, say, has a list of possible values v1, v2, … , vm with prob-
abilities P(X = v1), … , P(X = vm) of equalling these values. In other words, each actual
value x of X is equal to vi for some i = 1, … , m, and we allow m to be inﬁnite if required.
This can be regarded as an idealization of the histogram of data in Section 13.2.2, where
m is the number of classes. Typical examples are die tosses, birthdays, and the numbers
of defective components in a batch from a production line.
In general, the behaviour of a discrete random variable can be represented graphic-
ally by means of a probability function
PX(x) = P(X = x)
(−∞ x  +∞)
and illustrated in Figure 13.12(a) for Example 13.12. Also useful is the distribution
function Fx(x) deﬁned as
FX(x) = P(X  x)
(−∞ x  +∞)
Figure 13.12
Example 13.12: (a)
probability function;
(b) distribution
function.

and illustrated in Figure 13.12(b). This deﬁnition is based on the fact that the set of
points in the sample space for which X  x constitutes an event, and the probability 
of this event (as a function of x), forms the distribution function. Sometimes this is
referred to as the cumulative distribution function, because it measures the cumulative
probability up to (and including) the value of its argument.
Example 13.12
The number of ships arriving at a container terminal during any one day can be any
integer from zero to four, with respective probabilities 0.1, 0.3, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05. Plot the
probability and distribution functions.
Solution
The probability function is shown in Figure 13.12(a). The function has zero value except
at the ﬁve integer points. The value of the distribution function at any point x is the 
sum of the probabilities to the left of and including x. This is shown in Figure 13.12(b).
The function is discontinuous, with steps occurring at the integer points, and the value
at each integer includes the probability of that integer. This is indicated by the blob at
each step.
The distribution function will be discussed further after the other class of random vari-
ables has been introduced.
13.4.3
Continuous random variables
A continuous random variable X can take any value within some interval (v1, v2). If this
interval is not already inﬁnite, we deﬁne the random variable to have zero probabil-
ity for any value outside it, and hence extend the domain of deﬁnition to (−∞, +∞).
Typical examples are a person’s height and weight, component lifetimes, and all meas-
ured quantities expressed in units of mass, length, time, temperature, resistance and 
so on.
In general, the behaviour of a continuous random variable X is described by a
probability density function fX(x) for −∞ x  +∞, as illustrated in Figure 13.13.
As will be explained below, fX(x) is not the probability that X = x: instead, the density
function has to be understood in terms of the distribution function FX(x), which
measures (as before) the probability that the value of the random variable is less than
or equal to the argument x:
FX(x) = P(X  x)
(−∞ x  +∞)

13.4 RANDOM VARIABLES
1021
In this case, because there are no discrete steps in probability, FX(x) is continuous and
differentiable, and its derivative is called the probability density function fX(x):
The signiﬁcance of the density function is that it indicates for a continuous random
variable the concentration of possible observed values along the real axis. This inter-
pretation will be clariﬁed in Section 13.4.4.
Example 13.13
The lifetime of an electronic component (in thousands of hours) is a continuous random
variable with density function
(This is an example of an exponential distribution with parameter 
.) Plot the

The distribution and density functions show that most components have short lifetimes,
but a small proportion can survive for much longer.
13.4.4
Properties of density and distribution functions
In order to use the density and distribution functions, we need the following results,
which are immediate from the deﬁnitions:
(a)
FX(x) = 0
and
FX(x) = 1
lim
x→+∞
lim
x→−∞
1
2

Clearly it is impossible for a random variable to have a value less than −∞, and it is
certain to have a value less than +∞.
(b)
If x1  x2
then
FX(x1)  FX(x2)
Here the event that X  x1 is a subset of the event that X  x2, so the probability of the
latter must be at least as great as that of the former. From results (a) and (b) it follows
that at any point the distribution function is either constant or else increasing, ultimately
from its lower limit of zero (at −∞) to its upper limit of one (at +∞).
(c)
P(x1  X  x2) = FX(x2) −FX(x1)
For any random variable the difference between the values of the distribution function
at two points is the probability that a value of the random variable will lie between those
two points (or is equal to the upper one). For a continuous random variable this is also
the area under the density function between those points, by virtue of the relationship
between the functions:
P(x1  X  x2) =
fX(z)dz
as illustrated in Figure 13.15. This crucial result expresses the signiﬁcance of the
density function and leads to another feature of continuous random variables that
should be clearly understood. Setting x1 = x2 = x, we see that the probability P(X = x)
that the random variable has a value exactly equal to x is zero for any x, because the
integral is over a domain of length zero. This is in sharp contrast to discrete random
variables, which can only take certain speciﬁc values.
(d)
fX(x)dx = 1
The total area under the density function must be unity because the random variable
must have a value somewhere.
Example 13.14
For the distribution of component lifetimes in Example 13.13 ﬁnd the proportion of
components that last longer than 6000 hours.
Solution
Using the distribution function,
P(X  6) = 1 −P(X  6) = 1 −FX(6)
= 1 −[1 −e−6/2] = e−3  0.05
In other words, approximately one in 20 components lasts longer than 6000 hours.

Example 13.15
Two people have agreed to meet in a deﬁnite place between six and seven o’clock.
Their actual times of arrival are independent and entirely random (no arrival time more
likely than any other) within the hour. Find
(a) the density function of the time that the ﬁrst person arriving has to wait;
(b) the probability that the meeting will occur if the ﬁrst person to arrive does not wait
for longer than 15 minutes.
Solution
(a) The sample space can be regarded as a unit square as depicted in Figure 13.16(a).
Figure 13.16
(a) Sample space 
for Example 13.15. 
(b) Density and
distribution functions
for waiting time.
Each point represents a pair of arrival times, each measured as part of one hour from
six o’clock. Because all arrival times are equally likely for each person and because
they arrive independently, all points in the unit square are equally likely. Because the
total probability must be one, this implies that the probability of any subset of points is
simply equal to the area of that subset. Points along the diagonal lines offset along
either axis by a distance w correspond to a waiting time for the ﬁrst person arriving
(W, say) equal to w, because the difference between the arrival times is constant along
such lines. The shaded area therefore represents a waiting time greater than w. Putting
the two triangles together, we obtain a square of side 1 −w, so the probability that the
waiting time exceeds w is given by
P(W  w) = (1 −w)2
The complement of this gives the distribution function of waiting time:
FW(w) = P(W  w) = 1 −(1 −w)2 = 2w −w2
and, by differentiation, the density function is
fW(w) = 2(1 −w)
both functions being for w between zero and one and illustrated in Figure 13.16(b).
(b) The probability that the meeting will occur is the probability that the waiting time
does not exceed 15 minutes:

Measures of location and dispersion
The observable properties of a random variable are determined by its distribution of
probabilities (if discrete) or density function (if continuous), but this amount of infor-
mation is difﬁcult to extract from data. One common approach that is rather simpler is to

13.4 RANDOM VARIABLES
1025
assume that the random variable is one of a class whose distribution is speciﬁed by a
formula and which often arises in practice, such as the binomial, Poisson or normal.
These distributions will be covered in Section 13.5. Another common approach is
to characterize the random variable in terms of two numbers: a measure of location
(‘typical’ value) and a measure of dispersion (‘spread’ about that value). In practice,
both approaches are used together, with the measures of location and dispersion often
providing the parameters for the formula of the distribution.
Mean, median and mode
There are three common measures of location, the most important of which is the mean.
For a random variable X this is usually given the symbol µX and is deﬁned as
This represents a weighted sum of the possible values of X, with weights reﬂecting 
their relative likelihood of occurrence, and is effectively the ‘centre of gravity’ of the
distribution.
Another measure of location that is often used is the median. For a continuous 
random variable X this is the point mX for which
P(X  mX) = FX(mX) =
In other words, there are equal chances of X being greater than the median or less than
the median. For a discrete random variable the median may not be unique, and is any
point for which
P(X  mX) 
and
P(X  mX) 
The median of a distribution does not coincide with the mean unless the distribution has
an axis of symmetry, in which case both measures lie on it.
The third measure of location is the mode, which is any point for which the prob-
ability function PX(mode) (if discrete) or the density function fX(mode) (if continuous)
is an overall maximum. The mode can therefore be regarded as the most likely value
of X to be observed. The mean, median and mode can all differ (see for example
Figure 13.17), and can occur in any order.

Find the mean, median and mode for

(b) the number of ship arrivals (Example 13.12),
(c) the lifetime distribution (Example 13.13).
Solution
(a) For the toss of a fair die
The median is any point in the interval [3, 4], and each possible value is a mode.
(b) For the number of ship arrivals
µX = (0)(0.1) + (1)(0.3) + (2)(0.35) + (3)(0.2) + (4)(0.05) = 1.8
The median is two because P(X  2) = 0.75 and P(X  2) = 0.6, both of which exceed
one-half. The mode is also equal to two because this is the most likely value.

The median is given by
FX(mX) = 1 −e−mX/2 =
from which mX = 1.386. The mode, however, is zero because this is the peak of the
density function.
Variance, standard deviation and quartiles
There are two approaches to measuring the variation of random variables around
their central values (mean, median or mode). The most important such measure is the
variance, a weighted sum of squared differences between the possible values and the
mean, usually written as Var(X) or σ 2

13.4 RANDOM VARIABLES

This is analogous to ‘moment of inertia’: it measures how tightly concentrated the
possible values are about the mean (centre of gravity). One undesirable feature is that
the squaring operation changes the units, so that a random variable measured, say,
in volts will have a variance in volts-squared. The remedy is to use the standard
deviation σX, which is deﬁned as the square root of the variance.
The alternative approach to measuring dispersion is to exploit the distribution func-
tion FX(x). Suppose for simplicity that X is a continuous random variable. We have
already deﬁned the median by
FX(mX) =
The points q1 and q3 where
FX(q1) =
and
FX(q3) =
are called quartiles, and the median can also be described as a quartile q2. These
quartiles divide the range of possible values of X into four successive intervals, for each
of which the probability of X falling in the interval is one-quarter. In fact, a ﬁner sub-
division into 100 equally likely intervals is also used, the dividing points being called
percentiles. The ﬁrst quartile q1 is then the 25th percentile, and so on. The 10th and
90th percentiles are also known as the ﬁrst and ninth deciles, d1 and d9.
The most common measure of dispersion apart from variance (or standard deviation)
is the interquartile range q3 −q1. Sometimes the semi-interquartile range or quar-
tile deviation
(q3 −q1) is quoted instead. The interdecile range d9 −d1 is also used.

13.4.7
Expected values
The mean and variance are special cases of expected values for a random variable. In
general, the expected value of a function h(X) of a random variable X is
As before, this is a weighted combination of the possible values. The mean and
variance are retrieved by taking h(X) = X and h(X) = (X −µX)2 respectively.
Expected values have many applications. One immediate application is in a useful
alternative expression for the variance, obtained by expanding the square. If X is 
continuous then
σ 2
X =
(x −µX)2fX(x)dx
=
x 2fX(x)dx −2µX
xfX(x)dx + µ 2
X
fX(x)dx
= E(X2) −µ2
X
In other words, the variance is the expected value (or mean) of the square minus the
square of the mean. The same is true when X is discrete, by a similar proof.

13.4.8
Independence of random variables
It is possible for two different random variables to be measured for the same object: 
for example, a person’s height and weight. Individually, these random variables have
distributions, mean values and variances, which apply to a particular population, but
this is not the whole story. It is clear that taller people tend to be heavier than shorter
people (although obviously there are exceptions). In this case we say that these variables
are dependent upon each other (to some degree). The notion of dependence is basically
the same as that applying to events, discussed in Section 13.3.4. Furthermore, just as
events can be independent (Section 13.3.5), so can random variables. For example, it is
plausible that a person’s birthday and telephone number are not related in any way, and
are therefore independent random variables. Nothing is likely to be learnt about the one
from an observation of the other.
For independent events we have the rule that the joint probability is the product of
the separate probabilities:
P(A  B) = P(A)P(B)
For independent discrete random variables a similar rule applies:
P(X = ui  Y = vj) = P(X = ui)P(Y = vj)
where u1, u2, … , uk are the possible values of X and v1, v2, … , vm are the possible 
values of Y. This effectively speciﬁes a joint distribution for the two random variables.
If we sum over the possible values of Y then we ﬁnd
= P(X = ui)
Thus the individual probability of one value ui of X can be obtained from the joint
distribution by summing over all values vj of Y, with X ﬁxed at ui. In fact, this is true
even when the random variables are dependent.

A new plant at a manufacturing site has to be ﬁrst installed and then commissioned. The
times required for these two stages depend upon different random factors, and can
therefore be regarded as independent. Based on past experience, the respective distribu-
tions for X (installation time) and Y (commissioning time), both in days, are as follows:
ui
3
4
5
6
vj
2
3
4
P(X = ui)
0.1
0.4
0.3
0.2
P(Y = vj)
0.50
0.35
0.15
Find the joint distribution for X and Y, and the probability that the total time will not
exceed seven days.
Solution
Because the random variables are independent, the joint distribution is given by the
product of the separate distributions:
P(X = ui  Y = vj) = P(X = ui)P(Y = vj)
with the following result:
Note that the row and column totals give the individual distributions for X and Y. The
probability that the total time will not exceed seven days is given by the sum of those
joint probabilities above the stepped broken line:
P(X + Y  7) = P(X = 3  Y = 2) + P(X = 3  Y = 3) + P(X = 3  Y = 4)
+ P(X = 4  Y = 2) + P(X = 4  Y = 3) + P(X = 5  Y = 2)
= 0.050 + 0.035 + 0.015 + 0.200 + 0.140 + 0.150 = 0.59
13.4.9
Scaling and adding random variables
Example 13.19 has introduced the idea of a sum of random variables, itself a random
quantity. The distribution of this quantity can be deduced from the joint distribution; thus
in Example 13.19 the probability that the total time (installation plus commissioning)
will take exactly seven days is
P(X + Y = 7) = P(X = 3  Y = 4) + P(X = 4  Y = 3) + P(X = 5  Y = 2)
= 0.015 + 0.140 + 0.150 = 0.305
A similar calculation can be done for every possible value from the minimum (ﬁve
days) to the maximum (ten days), and the distribution is then complete.

Example 13.20
Find the distribution of total time for the situation described in Example 13.19, and the

Solution
Proceeding as described above, we obtain the following distribution:

P(X + Y = wk)
0.050
0.235

0.030
The expected value is then
There is, however, an easier way to arrive at the mean of a sum of random variables.
The separate means (or expected values) of X and Y are easily found from the values
given in Example 13.19:
It has turned out that
E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)
The mean of the sum of random variables is the sum of the means. That this is a
general result is shown as follows:
= E(X) + E(Y)
The double summation is over all the possible values of X + Y (which are ui + vj) times
the probability of each combination, and the result in Section 13.4.8 that summing a
joint probability over the values of one variable gives the probability of the other vari-
able has been used. Furthermore, because this also holds for dependent variables (as can
be seen in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics), the mean of a sum of random
variables is always equal to the sum of the means, whether they are dependent or not.

For the variance of a sum it is not quite so simple. If the mean of X is µX and the
mean of Y is µY then
Var(X + Y) = E{[(X + Y) −(µX + µY)]2} = E{[(X −µX) + (Y −µY)]2}
= E{(X −µX)2 + (Y −µY)2 + 2(X −µX)(Y −µY)}
= E{(X −µX)2} + E{(Y −µY)2} + E{2(X −µX)(Y −µY)}
The ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand side are Var(X) and Var(Y) respectively. The third
term (which is actually called the covariance) is a measure of dependence, and it
is shown in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics that this is always zero for
independent variables. Hence if X and Y are independent, the variance of a sum is equal
to the sum of the variances:
Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)
These results for the mean and variance of sums of random variables extend naturally
to any number of variables, and apply whether the variables are discrete or continuous.
If we add a constant (c, say) to a random variable X, it follows immediately from the
deﬁnitions in Section 13.4.6 that the same constant is added to the mean, but the vari-
ance does not change. If X is a continuous random variable, with density function fX(x),
say, then
E(X + c) =
(x + c)fX(x)dx =
xfX(x)dx + c
fX(x)dx
= µX + c
Var(X + c) =
[(x + c) −(µX + c)]2fX(x)dx
=
(x −µX)2fX(x)dx = σ 2
X
If we multiply a random variable X by a constant c, the mean is multiplied by c and
the variance by c2:
E(cX) =
cxfX(x)dx = cµX
Var(cX) =
(cx −cµX)2fX(x)dx = c2
(x −µX)2fX(x)dx = c2σ 2
X
All of these results hold whether X is continuous or discrete.

Example 13.21
If a mean temperature is 58°F, what is the mean temperature in degrees Celsius?
Solution
If TF and TC denote temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius respectively then
TC =
(TF −32)
so
E(TC) =
[E(TF) −32] =
(58 −32) = 13.4°C
13.4.10
Measures from sample data
We can now return to the consideration of data, which is the object of the whole
exercise. Given that the exact distribution of a random quantity under investigation is
usually not known in an experimental context but that the mean and variance at least
would be useful characteristics of it, it is reasonable to try to estimate these from the
data. Experience shows that quite good estimates of mean and variance can be obtained
even from rather small samples, whereas a much larger sample is needed before the
histogram gives a good approximation to the whole shape of the true distribution.
Sample average and variance
For a sample {X1, … , Xn} of data, the sample average and sample variance are
deﬁned as
respectively. The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance.
The average of the sample, and the average squared deviation from the sample 
average, are easy to work out from the data, and characterize the data in location and
dispersion. It turns out that these approximate the true ﬁgures of mean and variance, and
the approximations improve as n →∞in a sense to be made precise below.
By expanding the square in the formula for the sample variance (as in Section 13.4.7
for the true variance) it is easy to show that an alternative expression (which is useful
for hand calculation) is
that is, the average of the square minus the square of the average. When small samples
are used in statistics (this is considered in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathe-
matics), a different deﬁnition of sample variance must be adopted:

The difference between the two deﬁnitions is relatively small. Many scientiﬁc calcu-
lators provide functions to work out sample average and both forms of sample variance
or standard deviation.
Example 13.22
A die was tossed 24 times, producing the following results:
4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6
Find the sample average and standard deviation.
Solution
The average score over the 24 tosses is
X = 3.42
The average of the squares is 13.667, so the standard deviation is
SX = ÷[13.667 −(3.42)2] = 1.73
These ﬁgures are close to the theoretical values worked out in Examples 13.16 and 13.17.
An issue ﬁrst raised in Section 1.5 is important here: to how many places of deci-
mals should these results be quoted? The actual average of the data in this example is
3.4166 … , but the results should be stated with no more signiﬁcant digits than can be
justiﬁed statistically. The average might be quoted as 3, 3.4, 3.42, 3.417 and so on, but
the appropriate precision depends upon the sample size n.
The sample average itself is a random variable; it has a mean and variance, and it
follows from the results in Section 13.4.9 that
since the random variables, Xi, can be reasonably assumed independent here.
The larger the sample size, the smaller the variance of X and the greater the pre-
cision, but to quantify the precision we also need a value for σX. Usually all we have is
the estimate SX, but this is also a random variable and subject to error. It can be shown
that in many situations a (rather rough) indication of the accuracy of SX as an estimate
of σX is that its relative error (see Section 1.5.3) varies inversely with ÷(2n):
Returning to Example 13.22, with n = 24, the percentage error in SX is estimated at
14%, so the error in SX is likely to be of order 0.2, and the second decimal place has 
no meaning. The error in SX/÷n is correspondingly of order 0.05 in its value of 0.35.
The results of Example 13.22 can therefore be stated more properly as
X = 3.4
(with likely error of order 0.4)
SX = 1.7
(with likely error of order 0.2)

DATA HANDLING AND PROBABILITY THEORY

13.4 RANDOM VARIABLES
1035
In practice, these high standards of honesty are not always maintained, and it is very
important not to be misled by the spurious precision with which results are often quoted.
Example 13.23
Measured values of resistance (in Ω) for 12 nominally 100 Ωresistors were as follows:
106, 98, 95, 109, 99, 102, 101, 108, 94, 99, 96, 102
Find the sample average and both forms of sample variance and standard deviation.
Solution
The average of the 12 ﬁgures is
X = 100.75
which is slightly high but close to the nominal ﬁgure, and much closer to that ﬁgure
than a ‘typical’ value from the data. The two results for sample variance and standard
deviation are
S2
X = 22.9,
SX = 4.8
and
S2
X,n−1 = 25,
SX,n−1 = 5
Despite the small sample size, the difference between the two versions of sample stand-
ard deviation is not very large. Furthermore, following the above discussion, an error
of order 1.0 is likely in the standard deviation (÷
is about 20%), so there is no point
in distinguishing them, even to the ﬁrst decimal place. The value of SX/÷n is 1.4, with
a likely error of order 0.3, so the average should properly be stated as
X = 101
(with likely error of order 1.5)
It is worth noting that in Example 13.23 the distribution of the random variable (resist-
ance) is not known, but the sample provides useful information about the mean value
and the variability about that value.
As mentioned above, many scientiﬁc calculators will work these results out auto-
matically. There are also many statistical packages that run on computers of all sizes,
and they will do the same. Alternatively, Figure 13.18 contains a pseudocode listing of
an efﬁcient program to compute the sample average and standard deviation of a set of
data X1, … , Xn. The algorithm used works as follows.
Let Mk and Qk respectively represent the average of the ﬁrst k observations and the
sum of squares of deviations of the ﬁrst k observations about their average:
The program exploits the following recursion relations, which are proved in D. Cooke,
A. H. Craven and G. M. Clarke, Statistical Computing in Pascal (Edward Arnold,
London, 1985), pp. 54–5 (© 1985 Edward Arnold Ltd. Reproduced by permission of

and
Finally,
The use of this recurrence method avoids having to make two passes through the data
(as required for the original deﬁnition of the sample variance), and also avoids the loss
of precision involved in subtracting two quantities that often turn out in practice to be
large in magnitude and similar in value (as required by the alternative expression).
Sample median and range
The sample average and standard deviation are not the only measures of location and
dispersion derived from data. Suppose that the data {X1, … , Xn} are ordered so that
X(1)  X(2)  …  X(n)
Then a sample median that provides an estimate of the true median (Section 13.4.6)
can be deﬁned as

13.4 RANDOM VARIABLES
1037
A common measure of dispersion (especially for small samples) is the sample range
X(n) −X(1), the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the data set, often
used in quality control. The ideas of quartiles and percentiles (Section 13.4.6) can also
be applied to data, based on the cumulative percentages (Section 13.2.3).
Example 13.24
Find the sample median and range for the data in Examples 13.22 and 13.23.
Solution
For the die toss the sorted data are
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6
so the sample median is (3 + 4) = 3.5, and the sample range is 5.
For the resistors the sorted data are
94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101, 101, 102, 106, 108, 109
so the sample median is (99 + 101) = 100, and the sample range is 15.

Important practical distributions
A lot of information is required to specify the exact distribution of a random variable,
and even more to specify the joint distribution of two or more variables. The mean,
variance and covariance are useful measures of the most important properties of 
random variables, namely, location, dispersion and dependence, which can realistically
be estimated from data. These measures are of great value in statistics, as can be seen in
the companion text Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics. Another short cut is
provided by the various classes of distributions that are often used in statistical practice.
The user has to supply the values of certain essential parameters, perhaps using esti-
mates of mean and variance to do so, and then the probability distribution is determined
by a formula. Experience shows that these classes of distributions (which are idealized
in mathematical form) do approximate very well to the actual distributions in many
practical situations.
The most important of these classes of distributions are the binomial, Poisson and
normal. In this section we cover these, with a particular view towards the statistical
applications to follow.
13.5.1
The binomial distribution
Consider ﬁrst a simple coin-tossing experiment, or any other random situation where only
two outcomes are possible. We shall refer to these outcomes as ‘success’ and ‘failure’,
but any other pair of terms (appropriate to the context) will do. Imagine tossing the coin
(or performing the general experiment) n times and counting the number of successes.
Clearly the sample space for this random variable Y, say, is S = {0, 1, … , n} with 
values near the middle of the range being more probable than values near the ends. It
is this distribution that is sought.
A Bernoulli trial is a single observation of a random variable X, say, that can
take the values zero or one:
P(X = 1) = p
and
P(X = 0) = 1 −p
for some success probability p.
The mean and variance of X are easily derived:
E(X) = 1(p) + 0(1 −p) = p
and
E(X 2) = 12(p) + 02(1 −p) = p
Hence
σ 2
X = p −p2 = p(1 −p)
Now let {X1, …, Xn} denote n independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability
p. The number of successes is
Y = X1 + … + Xn

Suppose in general that Y = k, where 0  k  n. Then k of the Xi values are equal to
one and n −k are equal to zero. The probability of this occurring is
pk(1 −p)n−k
by the product rule (because the separate outcomes are independent).
There are many ways in which the k successes can be distributed among the n trials.
For instance, if n = 5 and k = 3, the result might be {1, 1, 0, 1, 0} or {0, 1, 1, 1, 0} or
{1, 0, 0, 1, 1}, and so on. As far as we are concerned, these are all equivalent, since we
are interested only in the total number of successes and not their particular arrangement
among the trials. The number of possible arrangements of the k successes among the n
trials is given by the binomial coefﬁcient (see Section 7.7.2)
Each arrangement of successes is exclusive of every other, so the addition rule of 
probabilities gives us the distribution
(k = 0, … , n)
This is the general form of the binomial distribution, with parameters n and p. The
mean and variance of the binomial distribution are
E(Y) = np
and
Var(Y) = np(1 −p)
(this follows from the mean and variance of the Bernoulli random variable and the
results on the mean and variance of sums of random variables in Section 13.4.9). Two
typical binomial distributions can be seen in Figure 13.19.

13.5 IMPORTANT PRACTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS
1041
Example 13.25
A component supplier claims that 95% of its catalogue items are in stock at any time.
A particular order for 20 different components is returned with three items missing as
being out of stock. Is this likely, given the supplier’s claim?
Solution
Each item can be either in stock or out of stock at any time, and the probability of each
item being out of stock is 5%. The binomial distribution therefore applies and
P(k out of stock) =
0.05k0.9520−k
so
P(3 or more out of stock) = P(3) + P(4) + … + P(20)
= 1 −P(0) −P(1) −P(2)
= 1 −0.3585 −0.3774 −0.1887
= 0.0755
This is unlikely, given the supplier’s claim.
There are several points to note about this simple example. The assumed ﬁgure of 5%
probability of being out of stock is prompted by the supplier’s claim, but in reality this
will be an average ﬁgure, both between components (some may be out of stock more
often than others because of supply difﬁculties) and over time (for the same reason).
The independence assumption may not be true – if for instance a consignment of several
similar types of components is awaited from a manufacturer and several of these are
included in the order.
Most importantly, the probability worked out in the solution is that of three or more
being out of stock, a result at least as extreme as that observed. Any result may have a
low probability. What matters here is how far into the ‘tail’ of the distribution the actual
result lies, and this is assessed by the total probability from there to the maximum value
of k, which is 20. Note the use of the complement rule to simplify the calculation.
13.5.2
The Poisson distribution
The binomial distribution becomes unwieldy for large values of its parameter n, as
illustrated in Examples 13.26 and 13.27. Another discrete distribution that often serves
as a useful approximation to the binomial is the following:
(k = 0, 1, 2, … )
This is the general form of the Poisson distribution, with parameter λ. It is shown in
Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics that the mean and variance of the Poisson
distribution are both equal to λ. These can be derived directly from the deﬁnition, but
are more easily obtained by using the moment generating function, which will also be
considered there. Also using this technique, it can be shown that for large n and small

p the Poisson distribution approximates the binomial with λ = np. As a guide, the
Poisson approximation can be used if n  25 and p  0.1. This is illustrated numeric-
ally in Figure 13.20, where binomial and Poisson distributions are compared for n = 25,
p = 0.1 and λ = 2.5.
Example 13.26
If 0.04% of cars break down while driving through a certain tunnel, ﬁnd the prob-
ability that at most two break down out of 2000 cars entering the tunnel on a 
given day.
Solution
The true distribution of breakdowns is binomial:
P(k breakdowns) =
(0.0004)k(0.9996)2000−k
for which P(0) = 0.449 26, P(1) = 0.359 55 and P(2) = 0.143 81, and
P(at most two breakdowns) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) = 0.952 61
Because n is large and p small, the Poisson aproximation can also be used, with
λ = np = 0.8, so that
P(at most two breakdowns)  e−λ(1 + λ +
λ2) = 0.952 58
The Poisson calculation is easier, and the agreement is very good. It would not normally
be appropriate to quote such an answer to ﬁve signiﬁcant digits but it is only with such
precision that the difference between the two distributions shows up.
Despite its ease of use compared with the binomial distribution, some calculations 
with the Poisson distribution are difﬁcult, especially those involving long summations.
The following recurrence formulae are useful both for hand calculation and in computer
programs. If X has a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, the successive Poisson
probabilities are given by

with P(X = 0) = e−λ. Furthermore, a cumulative property such as
can be rewritten in the nested form (see Section 2.4)
This approach can be generalized as follows: let
(k = n, n −1, … , 2)
then
P(X  n) = e−λG1
Example 13.27
A machine produces components that have defect A with probability 0.015 and defect
B with probability 0.020, the two defects being independent. If 54 components are
packed into a batch, what is the (approximate) probability that the batch contains at
least 50 components without defects?
Solution
By the complement and product rules, the probability that a component will have
neither defect is
P(A  B) = [1 −P(A)][1 −P(B)] = 0.9653
so the probability that a component will have at least one defect is 0.0347. If a batch
contains at least 50 good components then it contains at most four defective ones, and,
from the binomial distribution,
P(at most four defective) =
(0.0347)k(0.9653)54−k
This is rather unwieldy, so we use the Poisson approximation with λ = (54)(0.0347) = 1.874.
The successive values G4, … , G1 in the recurrence formula above are 1.469, 1.917,
2.797 and 6.241, and hence
P(at most four defective)  6.241e−1.874 = 0.958
In other words, about one batch in 24 will contain fewer than 50 good components.
The binomial and Poisson are discrete distributions, which have the widest applica-
tion among all discrete random variables. The Poisson distribution is especially useful
to engineers because of its importance in statistical quality control. This will be intro-
duced in Section 13.6, but we now turn to the most important of the continuous 
distributions.

13.5.3
The normal distribution
One class of distributions is awarded the name ‘normal’ because of the regularity 
with which random continuous data are found to obey it. This is no coincidence. The 
central limit theorem (Section 13.5.4) provides an explanation in terms of cumulative
independent random parts adding up to a normal whole, a situation that is of great value
in statistical inference (considered in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics).
The normal distribution also serves as an approximation to the binomial distribution
that complements the Poisson approximation.
The normal distribution has two parameters, which can be shown (see Question 60
in Exercises 13.5.7) to be the mean and standard deviation, so the appropriate symbols
µX and σX are used.
A continuous random variable X has a normal distribution with mean µX and
variance σ 2
X if
(−∞ x  +∞, σX  0)
The density function is symmetrical about µX and has the bell-shaped form shown in
Figure 13.21. This distribution is also sometimes referred to by its more traditional
name: the Gaussian distribution.
The need to declare that a random variable has a normal distribution (with a speci-
ﬁed mean and variance) is so common that a special notation exists for the purpose:
X  N(µX, σ 2
X)
Calculations involving the normal distribution are complicated by the fact that there 
is no simple expression for the integral of the density function on an arbitrary interval;
in other words, the distribution function FX(x) does not have a simple explicit form.
Instead, tables of this function are used. In fact, only a single table is needed: that for
the special case of a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one.

Table of the standard
normal cumulative
distribution function
Φ(z).

For any random variable X, whether normal or not, subtracting the mean gives a
random variable whose mean is zero:
E{X −µX} = 0
The variance is not changed by this subtraction, but then dividing by the standard
deviation gives a variable with a variance of one:
(this follows from the results in Section 13.4.9). It is a property of the normal distribu-
tion, not shared by most distributions, that the result of this operation is still normal. It
is usual to denote the new random variable by the letter Z:
This is then a standard normal random variable, to which the table applies. Con-
versely, any normal random variable can be considered to have been obtained from a
standard normal random variable by multiplying by the required standard deviation and
adding the mean:
X = σXZ + µX
It follows that we can use the one table for the standard normal for all calculations
involving normal variates.
Example 13.28
If X  N(4, 4), ﬁnd
(a) P(X  6.7)
(b) the constant c such that P(X  c) = 0.1.
Solution
(a)
= P(Z  1.35) = 0.9115
(from Figure 13.22)
(b) If P(X  c) = 0.1 then P(X  c) = 0.9, so that
from which
(c −4) = 1.282 (using Figure 13.22); hence c = 6.564.
Example 13.28 shows that the standard normal table can be used in either direction:
either to ﬁnd the probability of an interval or to ﬁnd the interval that gives a particular
probability.

The central limit theorem
The practical methods of statistical inference have foundations in probability theory,
and the fundamental assumption underlying many of these methods is that the data have
a distribution that is normal. Some statistical methods are robust in the sense that they
work reliably even under moderate violations of their assumptions, but it is unsatisfac-
tory to rely heavily upon this. If normality of the data were exceptional then this would
severely limit the scope of those methods that assume it. Fortunately (and as the name
implies), the normal distribution arises very frequently in practice; the reason for this
will be explained in this section.
Continuous measurements of random phenomena such as noise in electronic circuits
or wave elevation on the sea surface give rise to graphs of the form shown in Fig-
ure 13.23. If the signal is sampled at regular intervals and a histogram of values built
up, it is often found that the histogram closely approximates to a normal density curve.
Physically, there are many separate independent random components adding up to
produce the measured signal, and it is the total that is normal. There are many sources
of noise in an electronic circuit and there are many separate waves on the sea. That the
cumulative effect of these, which are often not individually normal, is to produce a total
that has that special character is the substance of the following result, which is proved
in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.

Theorem 13.1
Central limit theorem
If {X1, … , Xn} are independent and identically distributed random variables (the distri-
bution being arbitrary), each with mean µX and variance σ 2
X, and if
then, as n →∞, the distributions of Wn and Zn tend to Wn  N(µX, σ 2
X/n) and Zn  N(0, 1)
respectively.
end of theorem
Loosely speaking and with certain exceptions, the sum of independent identically
distributed random variables tends to a normal distribution. The following points
should be noted.
(a) The standard normal is obtained by subtracting the mean of the total and dividing
by the standard deviation.
(b) The distributions converge to the normal in the sense that the cumulative distribu-
tion functions converge. This ensures that all observational properties of Zn will be
standard normal for sufﬁciently large n.
(c) How large n has to be before the normal approximation is good depends upon the
underlying population. If the distribution of the variables Xi is symmetric about the
mean then convergence to the normal is rapid. Figure 13.24(a) shows the distributions
of the uniform random variable X with density function
fX(x) =
÷
(−÷3  x  ÷3)
(which has mean zero and variance one), together with those for Z2 and Z4. The normal
distribution is also shown. Figure 13.24(b) shows similar results for the exponential
random variable X with density function
fX(x) = e−(x+1)
(x  −1)
(which has mean zero and variance one), together with Z5 and Z25. Convergence is
clearly more rapid for the symmetric distribution.

(d) The theorem can be generalized so that the random variables Xi do not need to be
identically distributed, which is usually not the case in physical situations.
(e) Even where the data of an experiment are not normally distributed, the central limit
theorem implies that the sample average has a normal distribution for large samples.
Much valuable statistics exploits this fact.
Example 13.30
In a quality control scheme at a factory, batches of components are accepted or rejected
depending on the number of defective items counted in a sample. Rejected batches are
inspected and all defective items are replaced with good ones. From the machine reli-
ability statistics it has been calculated that the probabilities of three, four, ﬁve, six and
seven defective items in a rejected batch are 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.08 and 0.02 respectively.
Fifty rejected batches produced a total of 221 defective items. Does this suggest that the
machines are producing more defective items than they should?
Solution
If X represents the number of defective items in a rejected batch, the mean and standard
deviation are given by
µX = 3(0.3) + 4(0.4) + 5(0.2) + 6(0.08) + 7(0.02) = 4.12
σX = ÷[9(0.3) + 16(0.4) + 25(0.2) + 36(0.08) + 49(0.02) −(4.12)2] = 0.9928
By the central limit theorem, the aggregate count of defectives Y in 50 rejected batches
will be approximately normal, and
This probability is rather small, so the performance of the machines must come under
suspicion. In fact, a rather more accurate answer to this problem is obtained by making
a continuity correction, as explained in Section 13.5.5, but the conclusion is the same.
Example 13.30 is typical of many applications of the central limit theorem. The 
underlying distribution is certainly not normal, but it is reasonable to assume that the
aggregate is approximately normal.
Example 13.31
In Section 1.5.5 it was noted that the maximum error that would occur in the sum of
100 numbers, each of which was rounded to three decimal places, is 0.05. Find the
probability of the error in the sum exceeding 0.005 in magnitude, and the expected
magnitude of the error.
Solution
We assume that the error in a number rounded to 3dp may be anything between
−0.0005 and +0.0005, with all values in the range equally likely. In other words, the
error in each value is a uniform random variable X, say, with

σ 2
X = E(X 2) −µ2
X = 8.333 × 10−8
The error in the sum is a random variable Y = X1 + … + X100. By the central limit
theorem, approximately
Y  N(100µX, 100σ 2
X) = N(0, 8.333 × 10−6)
so
= P(Z  1.732) = 1 −Φ(1.732)
The error in the sum will exceed 0.005 in magnitude if Y  0.005 or Y  −0.005, so,
by symmetry,
P(| Y |  0.005)  2[1 −Φ(1.732)]
= 2(1 −0.9584)
= 0.0832
Thus, because the errors tend to cancel each other out, there is only one chance in 12 of
the error reaching even
of its maximum possible value. Furthermore, the expected
value of the error magnitude is
(by substitution of w = y2)
With σ 2
Y = 8.333 × 10−6, this gives E(|Y |)  0.0023, which is less than
of the 
maximum possible value.
13.5.5
Normal approximation to the binomial
One immediate corollary of the central limit theorem is that the normal distribution 
can be used to approximate the binomial distribution when n is sufﬁciently large. This 
follows from the deﬁnition of a binomial random variable as a sum of Bernoulli random

variables (see Section 13.5.1). All that has to be done is to choose the parameters of the
normal distribution to match the mean np and variance np(1 −p). As a rule, the normal
approximation can be used when n  25 and 0.1  p  0.9. For values of p outside
this range the Poisson approximation can be used.
It may seem surprising that the normal distribution, which is continuous, can be used
to approximate a discrete distribution, given the very different character of these two
types of random variable. The approximation of a discrete distribution X, say, by a con-
tinuous one Y works in the manner indicated in Figure 13.25. The probability that X
takes the integer value k is approximated by the area under the density function fY(y)
between k −0.5 and k + 0.5. Similarly, the following integral approximates to the
probability that X exceeds k:
P(X  k) 
fY(y)dy
By the same token we would have
P(X  k) 
fY(y)dy
This use of a half-integer shift in the limit of integration is called the continuity 
correction and gives a more accurate result.
Example 13.32
If 70% of airline passengers using a particular route are members of a frequent-ﬂyer
club, ﬁnd the probability that out of a sample of 50 chosen independently, more than 40
will be members of a frequent-ﬂyer club.
Solution
Let X represent the number who are members of a frequent-ﬂyer club. The conditions
for a binomial distribution are met, and the mean and variance are 50(0.7) = 35 and
50(0.7)(0.3) = 10.5 respectively. With no continuity correction, we have

With the continuity correction,

As a percentage, this difference is substantial, so the continuity correction is important.
We now have three special classes of distribution: the binomial, Poisson and normal.
The binomial is the most fundamental, and the others provide useful approximations to
it in different circumstances, but the Poisson and especially the normal also have very
important applications of their own. Increasingly in engineering and in all parts of
industry there are problems arising that involve these and other distributions but which
it is not practical to solve without the aid of a computer.
13.5.6
Random variables for simulation
Computer simulations are very widely used in research, design and training. Perhaps
the best known is the ﬂight simulator, upon which pilots receive much of their training.
Simulations are used in research and design wherever a system is too complex for a
complete solution to a problem to be obtained theoretically, or where a solution can be
obtained but its completeness or accuracy is open to question.
Simulations are deterministic if what occurs at any time is completely determined
by the state of the system. In contrast, they are stochastic if what occurs at any time
can be inﬂuenced by a chance element that is inherently unpredictable. Stochastic 
simulations therefore require that random variables (or outcomes) be generated within
the program. This may seem a hopeless requirement, considering that computer pro-
grams are sequences of deterministic instructions running on deterministic hardware.
However, it is possible to generate sequences of numbers that are deterministic and
repeatable but that have the appearance of being random. These pseudo-random 
numbers are very useful for simulations, and for other purposes such as the so-called
Monte Carlo numerical methods.
Most modern computers contain a software facility for generating pseudo-random
numbers with a uniform distribution on the interval (0, 1):
The successive variables {U1, U2, …} appear to be uncorrelated, and, although there is
some structure in the sequence (and indeed the sequence will eventually repeat itself),
it is rare for these deﬁciencies to cause problems in practice.
Random variables with non-uniform distributions are obtained from the sequence
{U1, U2, …} by applying various transformations. Figure 13.26 contains pseudocode
listings for generating the most common random variables. In each case it is assumed
that the system function ‘rnd’ returns a uniform (0, 1) value, which is stored in the 
variable U. The variable X contains the required value of the random variable. The
binomial is based on the Bernoulli, the Poisson on the exponential, and the normal on
the central limit theorem. For a full explanation of how these work see S. J. Yakowitz,
Computational Probability and Simulation (Addison-Wesley, 1977). Computer pack-
ages such as Minitab also often contain facilities for generating random data.

Engineering application: quality control
This is a topic of particular relevance to engineers, because the statistical methods of
quality control are widely and increasingly used in industry in order to promote the
reliability of products. Orders have been won and lost because one manufacturer has
implemented quality control in the workplace more than another and the purchaser has
used this as a criterion when deciding where to place the order.
Quality control statistics is not particularly difﬁcult, but (as usual) it rests on funda-
mental results such as the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution (Section
13.5.2). The methods apply mainly to mass production systems where quality can be
measured numerically.
This section will introduce the use of control charts for continuous monitoring of
quality, rather than the more traditional batch inspection plans, and control charts are
further discussed in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics.
13.6.1
Attribute control charts
Manufactured items that are elaborate and therefore expensive can each be tested 
thoroughly before dispatch to consumers, but such item-by-item testing must be ruled
out for low-level components on grounds of cost. Some defective items are bound to
slip through, and the objective of quality control is to keep the proportion of these
within acceptable and agreed limits.
Variations occur in the quality of a product, caused either by variations in the raw
material or input or by variations in processing. Quality is monitored by regular testing
of samples of output. Assume for now that the test consists in counting the number
within the sample which pass or fail according to some performance criterion. A small
proportion of defective items in the output is permitted while the process is said to 
be in control. If the actual proportion of defectives rises to an unacceptable level, the
process is said to be out of control, and the counts of defectives in the samples would
be expected to rise. We should like to detect this as soon as possible when it occurs, but
without incurring the expense of a large number of false alarms while the process is
actually in control.
An essential aid to the quality controller is the Shewhart control chart, which is a
plot of the successive counts of defective items against sample number. Figure 13.27 is
Figure 13.27
Attribute control chart
for Example 13.33.

an example of such a chart. Also shown on the chart are two limits on the counts of
defectives, corresponding to probabilities of one in 40 and one in 1000 of a sample
count falling outside the limit if the process is in control. These are called warning and
action limits respectively, and are denoted by cW and cA.
Any sample point falling outside the action limit would normally result in the pro-
cess being suspended and the problem corrected. Roughly one in 40 sample points will
fall outside the warning limit purely by chance, but if this occurs repeatedly or if there
is a clear trend upwards in the counts of defectives then action may well be taken before
the action limit itself is crossed.
To obtain the warning and action limits, we use the Poisson approximation to the
binomial. If the acceptable proportion of defective items is p, usually small, and the
sample size is n, then for a process in control the defective count C, say, will be a
binomial random variable with parameters n and p. Provided that n is not too small, the
Poisson approximation can be used (Section 13.5.2):
Equating this to 
and then to 
gives equations that can be solved for the warning
limit cW and the action limit cA respectively, in terms of the product np. This is the basis
of the table shown in Figure 13.28, which enables cW and cA to be read directly from the
value of np.
Example 13.33
Regular samples of 50 are taken from a process making electronic components, for
which an acceptable proportion of defectives is 5%. Successive counts of defectives in
each sample are as follows:

At what point would the decision be taken to stop and correct the process?
Solution
The control chart is shown in Figure 13.27. From np = 2.5 and Figure 13.28 we have
the warning limit cW = 5.5 and the action limit cA = 8.5. The half-integer values are to
avoid ambiguity when the count lies on a limit. There are warnings at samples 6, 10,
11, 15 and 16 before the action limit is crossed at sample 18. Strictly, the decision
should be taken at that point, but the probability of two consecutive warnings is less
than one in 1600 by the product rule of probabilities, which would justify taking action
after sample 11.
Example 13.33 shows that the strict practice of waiting for the action limit to be crossed
in the Shewhart control chart would be rather conservative. The long sequence of
counts that exceed the expected number of defectives would lead to the decision being
taken sooner in practice.

The control chart decribed above, with action and warning limits set by probability of
exceedance, is the standard practice in the United Kingdom. In the United States the
practice is rather different in that there is usually no warning limit and that action limit
(called the upper control limit, UCL) is set at three standard deviations above
the mean. Because the count of defectives is binomial with mean np and variance

control limits: n is
sample size, p is
probability of defect,
cW is warning limit
and cA is action limit.

Example 13.34
Find the UCL and apply it to the data in Example 13.33.
Solution
From n = 50 and p = 0.05 we infer that UCL = 7.1, which is between the warning limit
cW and the action limit cA in Example 13.33. The decision to correct the process would
be taken after the 15th sample, the ﬁrst to exceed the UCL.
Sometimes a lower limit control, LCL, is deﬁned at three standard deviations below
the mean:
LCL = np −3[np(1 −p)]1/2
If this is positive, it can be used to test whether the proportion defective in the output
is falling signiﬁcantly below the expected value.
Control charts are also useful for monitoring the output of a manufacturing process
where quality depends upon a numerical measure such as dimension, weight or resist-
ance. Charts that are more powerful than the Shewhart charts at detecting variations in
the output are also used. These topics are covered in Advanced Modern Engineering
Mathematics.

Engineering application: clustering of rare events
13.7.1
Introduction
To conclude this chapter, we shall apply some of the probability theory covered so far
to an investigation of a serious problem, or rather a family of problems. Failures of
engineering systems or structures are rare events, but they have serious consequences.
If a number of similar failures occur and a link between them can be found then it may

13.7 ENGINEERING APPLICATION: CLUSTERING OF RARE EVENTS
1059
be possible to anticipate and prevent future failures. One aspect of this is the detection
of regional variations in the number of failures, which may provide clues as to possible
causes.
Problems like this, and their associated difﬁculties, arise in many ﬁelds, and the 
lessons learned from analysing one can often be applied to others. Some typical examples
are as follows:
(a)
near-misses between two aircraft in ﬂight;
(b)
collisions or capsizing of ships at sea;
(c)
accidents involving road vehicles;
(d)
occurrences of environmentally induced diseases such as leukaemia.
These problems can be looked at in various ways, but there is an approach that applies
to all of them because of the following common elements:
(a)
a very large number of potential cases;
(b)
a very small proportion of these become actual cases;
(c)
a possible common cause;
(d)
regional variations in the common cause if it exists.
Common causes for (a) and (b) that vary regionally could be dangerous weather con-
ditions or inadequate control over routes taken; for (c) they could be inadequate lighting
or hazard warnings, and for (d) they could be proximity to a nuclear installation. For
each problem it is important to identify the common cause if it exists – and one clue 
to its existence is the regional variation. Also, for each problem the main difﬁculty is
the rarity of the cases, and it is this that makes an analysis using probability theory 
useful.
This case study is expressed in terms of a survey of near-misses in aircraft oper-
ations, but the analysis could be applied to any of the above examples. The ﬁgures are
hypothetical, but the method of analysis is realistic.
13.7.2
Survey of near-misses between aircraft
Suppose that the major airlines cooperate in a survey of near-misses during a period of
one year. The region being studied is divided up into 1000 areas in such a way that there
are on average 200 ﬂights per year through each area. Suppose that the total number of
ﬂights is 200000 and that the total number of near-misses logged by the pilots is 120.
Although a near-miss involves two aircraft, it is recorded as a single incident. At the
end of the year the data is examined and two areas in particular stand out. In one area
A four incidents occurred in a total of 400 ﬂights, and in another area B two incidents
occurred in a total of 150 ﬂights.
The question that it is natural to ask is whether there are any areas, in particular these
two, in which the number of near-misses is greater than can be accounted for by chance.
If any such area exists, it can be examined to see what makes it special, and this may
lead to the discovery of a common cause and appropriate action being taken. To
approach this, we shall ﬁrst assume that the probability that a near-miss will occur is the
same for every ﬂight and in every area. This probability is taken to be the total number
of near-misses divided by the total number of ﬂights, which gives p = 6 × 10−4.
To assess how unlikely the ﬁgures for areas A and B are we need to calculate the
probability of the given number or more of incidents, as explained in the discussion

following Example 13.25. If we assume that the probability p applies independently for
every ﬂight, then for area A, using the binomial distribution, we have
P(4 or more incidents)
which gives 1.13 × 10−4. Alternatively, using the Poisson approximation (Section 13.5.2),
P(4 or more incidents)
(with λ = 400p = 0.24)
= 1.14 × 10−4
which is close to the exact ﬁgure. Similarly, for area B
P(2 or more incidents) = 1 −(1 −p)150 −150p(1 −p)149 = 3.79 × 10−3
 1 −e−λ(1 + λ)
(with λ = 150p = 0.09)
= 3.82 × 10−3
The effectiveness of the Poisson approximation to the binomial is clear from these
results.
The four incidents in area A are seen to be much less likely to be due to chance than
the two incidents in area B. This is interesting, because common sense would suggest
comparing the proportions in the respective areas, which are 1% for A and 1.33% for
B. Despite having the lower proportion of incidents, area A provides stronger evidence
for a regional anomaly, by more than an order of magnitude.
The extent of anomaly can be judged from the probability that at least one of the
1000 areas in the region will give a result at least as extreme as those observed. After
all, with 1000 opportunities for a rare event to occur, the probability that it will occur
in at least one of them is signiﬁcantly enhanced. Using the complement and product
rules we have
P(at least one event with probability 1.13 × 10−4 in 1000 areas)
= 1 −P (no such events)
= 1 −(1 −1.13 × 10−4)1000 = 0.107
Similarly,
P(at least one event with probability 3.79 × 10−3 in 1000 areas)
= 1 −(1 −3.79 × 10−3)1000 = 0.978
The area B result has a high probability of occurring by chance, somewhere within the
1000 areas. However, there is only one chance in ten that a result as improbable as that
in area A would occur anywhere, assuming a constant value of p. It seems that the true
probability of a near-miss is higher in that area. Although the number of incidents is
small, quite a ﬁrm conclusion has been reached.

The most interesting point about this analysis is that the comparison of proportions,
which is the most obvious way of judging the results, is so misleading. The reason why
it doesn’t work is that (as can be seen in Advanced Modern Engineering Mathematics)
the variance of a sample proportion depends upon the size of the sample, the denomin-
ator in that proportion. Dividing the number of incidents by the number of ﬂights in an
attempt to normalize the data fails to eliminate the number of ﬂights as a variable,
because of its lingering inﬂuence on the statistics.
This is as far as the mathematical analysis can proceed. It cannot point to any
particular cause without further data. Tracking down the reason for the anomaly can be
very difﬁcult in situations like this, but at least the search can be focused on an area.
The local weather, the operating procedures and technical support of the ﬂight con-
trollers, and natural sources of interference in the navigational equipment would all be
under suspicion.

Error-correcting codes are widely used for data
transmission. A message consisting of N binary
bits is partitioned into blocks of k bits, and each
block is transmitted with some additional parity
bits, giving a total of n bits per block. The parity
bits are used at the receiving end to correct any
errors that occur in transmission (bits that get
inverted, including the parity bits themselves).
Some error-correcting codes can correct only a
single error per block; others can correct up to 
two errors. The number n −k of parity bits is
chosen as small as possible to satisfy the
relationship:

independently at an average rate of 1% of bits
transmitted. For data blocks k of 4, 8, 16, 32 and

Do this for single- and double-error-correcting codes.
(b) Find for each type of code the largest block

overall interpretation at the receiving end. Compare

32 y = (x −5)4 + 15(x −5)3 + 80(x −5)2 + 165(x −5) + 81.
Since coefﬁcients are all positive, zeros of y must all
lie to the left of x = 5, i.e. x  5. Hence the zeros of 
y lie between x = 0 and x = 5.

(d) To modify the circuit we introduce the chairman’s
vote E. If N denotes No and Y denotes Yes, the new
circuit must have the output
Nnew = (Nold + T)·E
Ynew = (Yold + T)·E
where T = Tie. Hence the modiﬁed circuit will be
A tie is now impossible.
