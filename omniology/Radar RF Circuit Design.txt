Acknowledgments
We would like to thank our families for providing endless support in the cre­
ation of this work. Writing a book is a labor of love, and it is their love and 
inspiration that kept our fingers tapping. In addition, we offer many thanks to 
the reviewers for their insight, guidance, and encouragement throughout the 
writing process.
We would also like to thank Keysight Technologies for generously pro­
viding access to its analysis software for generating the simulation examples 
provided. Our industry has come a long way from vellum paper and slide rules 
thanks to trailblazers in electronic design like Keysight Technologies.
Finally, we’d like to thank our readers for their interest and passion in 
the subject. We sincerely believe that tighter collaboration and understanding 
between system designers and component designers will lead to advancements 
in radar technology like never before. It all begins with crossing the chasm from 
system to component level. Let’s get started.

Crossing the Chasm from System to 
Component Level
There is in practice a clear division between “system-level” and “component-
level” thinking. Engineers typically classify themselves as system or component 
designers, and indeed that is the case for the authors of this book. Conferences 
also often differentiate between system and component focus. Funding sources 
[like government broad agency announcements (BAAs)] seek to make advance­
ments at one level or the other. Consequently, it’s easy to see why a chasm natu­
rally exists. The chasm is so deep that even the vernacular is different. Table 1.1 
lists various terms commonly used at the system and component level.
1.1  Basic Radar Systems Overview
To first order, the performance of a radio detection and ranging, or radar, sys­
tem is driven by the size of the antennas employed and the power it can gener­
ate. In practice however, both these quantities are highly constrained due to a 
multitude of factors including size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C). Thus, 
real-world radar systems engineering quickly evolves into “getting the most out 
of what is available.” In addition to clever signal-processing techniques, such as 
pulse compression and adaptive processing, optimizing component-level per­
formance is key—and the subject of this book. This is made clear in the follow­
ing description of a basic radar system.
At the simplest level, radar systems operate by sending out a signal and 
precisely measuring the reflection. The distance from the radar to the target is 
determined by the time required for the signal to return. The velocity of the tar­
get can be determined from the measured Doppler shift or simply by observing

the change in range over time. Monostatic radars generally use one antenna (or 
two colocated) to perform both transmit and receive functions, whereas bistatic 
radars use two different antennas separated by a distance much greater than the 
wavelength of operation. 
1.1.1  Radar Transmitters
A radar transmitter generates a frequency signal of interest, amplifies the signal 
to a power level sufficient to reach the desired maximum range of operation, 
and radiates that signal into the environment through an antenna. The signal 
will either come in contact with an object and scatter, or it will eventually 
propagate far enough that it is naturally absorbed into the atmosphere or pro­
ceed further to travel into space. Generally, radar transmitters are benchmarked 
against the following parameters:
• Power-aperture product, or the maximum operating range; a function 
of the ERP out of the transmit and the two-way antenna gain (transmit 
and receive antenna gain).
• Operating frequency, or how the signal behaves when propagating 
through the atmosphere; it is also related to the amount of signal band­
width that is practical. Higher operating frequencies allow for wider 
bandwidth and, in turn, finer range resolution (which is proportional to 
the reciprocal of the operating bandwidth).
• Prime power, or the energy (i.e., fuel) required to operate the system, 
which is always greater than the ERP.
• Power output variation, or how the power fluctuates with frequency.
• Intermodulation, or the ability to generate signals as spectrally clean as 
possible.
• Robustness, or the ability for a system to survive or recover from a me­
chanical or electrical disturbance.

1.1.2  Radar Receivers
A radar receiver detects the scattered signal from the environment, amplifies the 
signal to a level suitable for processing, filters unwanted components (if pos­
sible), and extracts usable information. This information includes, for example, 
the size, position, and direction of objects within the operating range. Gener­
ally, radar receivers are benchmarked against the following characteristics:
• Sensitivity: The ability to detect signals above the background noise 
floor;
• Selectivity: The ability to differentiate signals from one another;
• Intermodulation: The ability to suppress the creation of additional non­
linearities from the input signals;
• Frequency locking: The ability to lock on and track detected signals;
• Leaky radiation: The ability to prevent detected signals from leaking to 
the antenna and reradiating;
• Robustness: The ability to survive or recover from a mechanical or elec­
trical disturbance.
Practical Note
One of the greatest advantages of radar is its ability to reach out over vast distances 
in all weather conditions. The Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico has been used 
in radar mode to map the surface of Venus nearly 42 million kilometers (26 million 
miles) away! As one would expect, the signal reflection from a target many hundreds 
or even thousands of miles away can be many orders of magnitude less than that 
which was transmitted—as much as 100-dB attenuation or more.
1.1.3  Fundamental Equations
The basic principles of radar have been studied since the early 1900s. Although 
it is presented in many forms, the main radar equation is [1]:
	
(

λ σ
π
=

(1.1)
where Pr  is the received power (watts), Pt is the transmit power (watts), Gt is the 
transmitter antenna gain (unitless), Gr is the receiver antenna gain (unitless), λ 
is the wavelength (meters, m), σ is the radar cross section (RCS) of the target 
(square meters, m2), and R is the distance to the target (m). 

6 
Radar RF Circuit Design
Equation (1.1) is generally applied to the single pulse case, where the 
pulse width τ is inversely proportional to the receiver bandwidth B. If pulse 
compression is employed, whereby the pulse width is much larger but still re­
tains the same bandwidth, a multiplicative term in the numerator of (1.1) is 
included, which is equal to the time-bandwidth product τB.
Additionally, if Doppler processing is employed, whereby a set of N pulses 
(compressed if pulse compression is employed) are fed to a Doppler filter bank, 
an additional gain term in the numerator of (1.1) proportional to N is added 
(coherent processing assumed).
The effective target signal strength is directly proportional to the received 
power level. Per the radar equation, smaller targets can be detected by doing the 
following:
• Increasing the transmit power level;
• Increasing the transmit and/or receive antenna gain (that is, making 
them more directive);
• Decreasing the distance from the target;
• Increasing the dwell time (i.e., illuminating the target for longer periods);
• Increasing the pulse width via pulse compression techniques;
• Optimizing the choice of polarization (target RCS often varies with po­
larization).
By far, the biggest impact can be gained by decreasing the distance to 
the target (the infamous “R to the fourth” relationship). Since this is generally 
not possible, it is necessary to optimize all of the above to achieve requisite 
performance.
If the target is in motion, the received signal will be shifted in frequency 
from the transmitted signal. This change in frequency is due to the Doppler 
shift and can be calculated by [1]:
	
=
± 2
o
r
o
vf
f
f
c
	
(1.2)
where fr  is the received frequency (Hz), fo  is the original (transmitted) fre­
quency (Hz), v is the target velocity projected along the radial line-of-sight 
direction (meters per second, m/s), and c is the speed of light (m/s). Note that 
the sign is positive when the target is approaching and negative when the target 
is receding.

 
Crossing the Chasm from System to Component Level 
7
For example, a target traveling at Mach 1 (340.3 m/s) will have a Doppler 
shift of 22.7 KHz on a 10-GHz signal. This is a very small difference that must 
be accurately measured if radial velocity is a required radar output.
In the real world, any received electrical signals are always accompanied 
by unwanted background signals called noise. Though there can be many sourc­
es of such interference, some are fundamental and completely unavoidable. The 
most ubiquitous is so-called thermal noise, which is due to random molecular 
motions in the radar components due to temperature. The thermal noise power 
(Pn) in a radar receiver at 290K is calculated by:
	
=
n
o
P
kT FB 	
(1.3)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant (1.38×10–23 W·s/K), To is the standard tem­
perature (290K), B is the instantaneous receiver bandwidth (Hz), and F is the 
noise figure of the receiver (unitless) and is highly dependent on component 
selection and design—the focus of this book.
To be an effective radar, the target signal must have a power level that can 
be distinguished from the thermal noise floor. To ensure this is the case, the ra­
tio between the signal level and the noise level must be carefully analyzed. This 
SNR can be determined by combining the earlier equations [1]:

While the radar is in search mode, the target’s location is unknown. There­
fore, the radar must search a greater volume of space. The following relationship

where Pavg is the average transmitted power (W), Ae is the effective aperture size 
(m2), σ is the RCS of the target (m2), Tfs is the frame search time (seconds, s), 
k is Boltzmann’s constant, Ω is the search angle solid angle (steradian), Ls is 
the system loss (unitless), To is the standard temperature (290K), F is the noise 
figure (unitless), and R is the distance to the target (m). Note that both system 
losses and noise figure are directly related to the choice of “components and 
circuits” employed by the radar.
While the radar is in track mode, the target location is known to a degree 
sufficient to focus resources. Therefore, the antenna can be pointed directly at 
the target. The following relationship is the track radar equation [1].

(m), k is Boltzmann’s constant, To is the standard temperature (290K), Ls is the 
system loss (unitless), and B is the noise bandwidth of the receiver (Hz).
1.1.4  Requirements on Components
From the SNR equations for searching and tracking, the parameters that effect 
performance are evident. However, a radar’s power, antenna, operating frequen­
cy, and bandwidth are often dictated by the application and host platform—
and the target cross section is rarely under the control of the radar. Therefore, 
the only design variables left to the radar engineer to enhance performance is 
the minimization of so-called system losses and noise figure [and possibly an­
tenna efficiency, especially for electronically scanned antennas (ESAs)]. 
The front-end components (i.e., antenna, RF filter, amplifier, and wir­
ing/cabling between these components) all contribute to the system thermal 
noise, and thus great care must be given to minimize these effects. Both the 
architecture and component performance can have a big impact. For example, 
if the RF filter and amplifier can be placed in close proximity to the antenna 
(perhaps “integrated into” the antenna), then significant wiring/cable losses can 
be mitigated. However once an architecture is set, all focus is on maximizing 
component performance, such as the filters and amplifiers.
When requirements flow down from the system level, they generally fall 
into five categories:
• Electrical: Performance required to achieve the system needs;
• Physical: Size and form factor that fits in the space allotted;
• Cost: Price point needed to be marketable;
• Operating conditions: Thermal, lifetime, and other environmental 
factors;
• Manufacturability: Constraints posed by the production facility.
Unfortunately, all too often, these flow-downs are dictated without an 
understanding of what is possible at the component level. Sometimes require­
ments are set that exceed physics; sometimes requirements are set below what 
could be achieved because they are presumed impossible.

Practical Note
One of the next-generation wideband radars under development had a stringent fre­
quency flatness requirement. This requirement was flowed down from the system 
designers to the submodule design teams. To compensate for the +6-dB/octave gain 
slope inherent in the antenna array, the designers incorporated a lossy equalizer cir­
cuit. Separately, the amplifier front-end design team incorporated a lossy equalizer 
circuit to compensate for the –6-dB/octave gain slope inherent in their active com­
ponent. Had the system designers understood the complementary nature of these 
components, 6 dB more power would have been available (magnifying the receive 
power level by four times)!
1.2  Introduction to Microwave Components
Microwave components are the building blocks for microwave assemblies, 
modules, subsystems, and ultimately systems. Passive components manipulate 
electrical signals without adding energy. Active components do the same, but 
they draw on energy from an external source and can thus potentially add en­
ergy (such as amplification) to a signal. 
1.2.1  Fundamental Equations
The most fundamental behaviors of electromagnetics are described by Max­
well’s equations. Although compact and perhaps deceptively “simple,” they are 
extremely powerful in what they represent. A deep understanding of their us­
age is not necessary to be a good microwave designer, but they are referenced 
throughout the book [2]. A description of each follows.

1.2.2  Essential Components
Just as craftspeople must be familiar with their tools, microwave designers must 
understand the diversity of components at their disposal. Table 1.2 lists the 
most common RF components in alphabetical order with a brief explanation. 
Design strategies for most of these, or portions thereof, are discussed in this 
book.

1.3  Traveling Wave Tubes Versus Solid State
Radars used during World War II used magnetrons to create traveling wave 
tube amplifiers (TWTAs), pronounced “tweet-ahs”. Today, TWTAs are still the 
primary technology for extremely high-frequency/high-power applications. Al­
though transistors have paved the way for smaller, more affordable, easier to 
integrate, and more robust systems, there are certain power levels that still elude 
them. Klystrons and TWTAs that provide 10s of megawatts of power are avail­
able, whereas kilowatt solid-state amplifier modules are still in their infancy [3]. 
The focus of this book is on solid-state solutions since that is arguably the 
future of radar systems. Also, extremely high-power radars can be created from 
solid-state amplifiers if multiple coherent antennas are used, each driven by sep­
arate solid-state amplifiers. These are referred to as active electronically scanned 
antennas (AESAs). The ease of integration into AESA configurations, which 
offer reduced prime power requirements and versatility, makes them an ideal 
component in radar systems. Throughout the text, a comparison to TWTAs 
will be made for reference. 
1.4   “How” Components are Connected Matters
Consider the two receiver configurations shown in Figure 1.1. 
Figure 1.1(a) shows an antenna connected to an LNA via a conveniently 
sized run of coax cable. The reason this configuration is convenient is because 
the amplifier can be placed in a suitable location isolated from the elements, 
other RF interference, and perhaps with easy access to repairs. Lots of benefits! 
Now consider Figure 1.1(b), where the LNA is place directly behind the anten­
na. For the same antenna and LNA, which configuration has the lowest noise 
figure? Even without intimate RF design knowledge most engineers can easily 
reason that Figure 1.1(b) has a better noise figure since the coax cable, as an 
electrical component, adds loss and thermal noise. In fact, the added loss is pro­
portional to the square root of frequency, the type of metal and dielectric used 
in the coax, and the diameter of the coax. Not something to be chosen casually!
The examples in Figure 1.1 illustrate that even the most basic aspects of 
combining RF components have a profound impact on overall performance. 
Despite the noise figure advantage of the Figure 1.1(b) configuration, there 
are many applications where it simply is not possible to colocate the LNA and 
antenna. Thus the goal in such situations is to minimize the distance to the 
greatest extent possible and, of course, to use the highest quality coax possible.
Other major component connection/configuration considerations in­
clude location of components to allow for waste heat removal (a major con­
sideration in high-power applications), placement to minimize RF leakage 
into other components, and placement and packaging to meet often stringent

Introduction to Microwave Design
Microwave design starts by understanding wave theory—or the rules that gov­
ern how signals (energy) propagate through a material. Once that is under­
stood, ways to manipulate those signals through amplification, attenuation, 
transformation, and filtering can be explored.
Chapter 2 begins by treating all microwave components like a black box 
with at least one external interface (or port). Higher-level functions, including 
those mentioned earlier, are implemented by connecting multiple components 
together at their ports. Just like trying to connect a square peg to a round hole, 
integrating microwave components requires handling the interface properly to 
avoid mismatch. Otherwise, performance will be reduced, and potentially the 
integrated circuit will not function at all.
This chapter discusses methods for describing a component’s behavior by 
quantifying its port performance are discussed, along with the process for de­
termining the effect of mismatch. In addition, the chapter explains how waves 
propagate through various microwave structures, materials, and discontinuities. 
These are the prerequisites for microwave design.
Throughout the text, the unit of length will be presented in the most 
appropriate form. For example, equations are usually expressed in terms of me­
ters (m), but printed circuit board thickness and metal widths are usually pub­
lished in mils or thousandths of an inch (in). To convert between units, use the 
following:
• 1 in = 1000 mils = 25.4 millimeters (mm);
• 1 mil = 25.4 microns (μm) = 0.0254 mm;
• 1 mm = 1000 μm = 39.37 mils = 0.03937 in.

2.1  Scattering Matrix
Radar system development begins as a block diagram that shows how the 
desired functionality is implemented, along with a set of performance and 
SWAP‑C requirements. Some of those blocks include microwave components, 
such as filters, couplers, amplifiers, and antennas. When operating as a linear 
system (output is proportional to input), the scattering matrix, more common­
ly known as the S-parameter, is the preferred method for representing behavior 
at component ports (i.e., inputs and outputs). More specifically, it is a math­
ematical representation of the incident, reflected, and transmitted port voltages. 
As an example, for a two-port network (Figure 2.1), the scattering matrix is a 
ratio of the following:
• S11: Reflected voltage amplitude at port 1 to incident voltage at port 1;
• S22: Reflected voltage amplitude at port 2 to incident voltage at port 2;
• S21: Voltage amplitude exiting port 2 to voltage incident at port 1;
• S12: Voltage amplitude exiting port 1 to voltage incident at port 2.
Practical Note
S-parameter matrix notation (i.e., S11, S21, and S54) is a concatenation of individual 
ports. Therefore, they should be read as such. For example, S11 should be read “S one 
one” not “S eleven.”
Figure 2.1 provides an example of a two-port network. This same nomen­
clature can be applied to any linear N-port network.
S-parameters are commonly represented in log scale in decibels. (They 
can also be found in magnitude-phase formats.) Generally S11 is in negative 
decibels to indicate less power is reflected than is incident. S21 is negative for 
passive circuits (indicating loss) and positive for active circuits (indicating gain).
The return loss at port m in decibels can be calculated from

Return loss and insertion loss are always positive numbers (in decibels). 
Negative loss implies positive gain which may not be the case. This is not to 
be confused with S11 (the S-parameter representation of return loss) or S21 (the 
S-parameter representation of insertion loss), which can be negative in decibels. 
For example, a 10-dB return loss is the equivalent of –10 dB S11. In circuit de­
sign, it is preferable for S11 to always be negative.
For most applications, a 10-dB return loss is considered sufficient for 
proper operation. This computes to 0.1 or 10% reflected power. Other applica­
tions require 20 dB, or 1% reflection. When analyzing a chain of components, 
it is important to take return loss into consideration. This is especially impor­
tant in radars where often good return loss must be sacrificed to achieve other 
SWAP-C considerations.
Some properties of S-parameters [1] are described as follows:
• Any perfectly matched port has Smm = 0 (no signal is reflected);
• Reciprocal networks have Smn = Snm, which is true for any passive linear 
network;
• Passive circuits have

• Active linear circuits can have

2.2  Matching Networks
Most systems have standardized on 50+j0Ω system impedance (50Ω marks a 
compromise between 30Ω, which is best for power handling, and 77Ω, which 
is best for minimizing loss, in a coax line). For ease of integration, all lower-level 
assemblies and components conform to this impedance. Achieving perfect 50Ω 
operation is impractical, but it is the component designer’s mission to get as 
close as possible while meeting all other criteria. 
Matching networks attempt to bridge the gap between inherently low-
impedance circuits (i.e., high-power amplifiers), high-impedance circuits (i.e., 
antennas), and the 50Ω system. In order to minimize the impact on system effi­
ciency, matching networks must be as low-loss as possible. They must also sup­
port the complete bandwidth, power-handling, and phase-stability demands 
on the components they connect. A properly matched receiver will provide 
significantly better SNR than a poorly matched receiver.
In a perfect system, components in a block diagram would be cascaded 
together, and the total loss of the circuit would be equivalent to the sum of the 
individual component losses. However, in a practical system, not all compo­
nents will provide a perfect system impedance at the ports. Between any two 
connected ports, some of the energy will be reflected back (reflected power) in­
stead of delivered to the next component (incident power). To minimize reflec­
tions and maximize transmission, matching networks can be added to convert 
one impedance to another.
During the development phase of a program, incorporating tunable 
matching networks can give designers the ability to compensate for circuit-
to-circuit variation. This is especially useful when commercial off-the-shelf 
(COTS) components are used and cannot be modified.
2.2.1  Quantifying Mismatch
A transmission line of length l and characteristic impedance Zo is terminated by 
a load ZL as shown in Figure 2.2. The impedance looking into the circuit is Zin, 
and the ratio of reflected power (reflection coefficient) is ΓL.
If ZL = Zo and the transmission line is lossless, there is no impedance 
mismatch, and ΓL is zero regardless of the transmission line length. In practical 
systems, this is never the case (at least at all frequencies). We can quantify the 
situation by:

Figure 2.3 plots ZL versus ΓL for a Zo of 50Ω. If ΓL is 0, there is no reflec­
tion and ZL is 50Ω. If ΓL is –1, ZL is 0Ω (short circuit). If ΓL is +1, ZL is ∞Ω 
(open circuit). Even a small impedance mismatch can cause significant reflected 
power.
The impedance looking into the transmission line and load is a function 
of Zo, ZL, l, and the wavelength (λ) [2].

For lossy transmission lines, the guided wavelength (λg, discussed later) 
should replace λ.
Practical Note
From (2.7), we can determine the impedance looking into a short (ZL = 0Ω) and open 
(ZL = ∞Ω) load. The short circuit input impedance is jZo tan(2πl/λ), and the open 
circuit impedance is –jZo cot(2πl/λ).

Another parameter for quantifying how well a load is matched is the volt­
age standing wave ratio (VSWR) (pronounced “viz-warr”). The value is written 
as a ratio compared to 1. A perfect match would have a VSWR of 1:1. A com­
monly specified VSWR is 2:1, which corresponds to a return loss of 9.54 dB 
and a reflection coefficient of 0.333. These values can be calculated from (where 
RL is in decibels):

One of the challenges with specifying VSWR is that the quantity is scalar (only am­
plitude, no phase, information is presented). Therefore, both an open circuit and a 
short circuit have the same VSWR (∞:1). When converting from VSWR, ΓL must be 
represented as the absolute value.

2.2.2  Graphically-Based Circuits
Part II will discuss how to determine the ideal impedances for a component. 
For an amplifier, for example, these would be the optimal source and load im­
pedances for power, efficiency, and linearity, among other factors. This section 
assumes that these impedances are known. One of the simplest, most visual, 
and most intuitive methods for designing a matching network is to use a Smith

chart. A Smith chart is a graphical representation of the plane of real (Re) and 
imaginary (Im) impedances. Figure 2.4 shows a Smith chart.

where Zn is the impedance plotted (Ω), Z is the impedance of interest (Ω), and 
Zo is the system impedance (Ω). In most cases, Zo is 50Ω so all impedances are 
divided by 50 before plotting. The center of the chart marks the system imped­
ance and is always 1. The leftmost point of the chart marks a short circuit, or Zn 
= 0. The rightmost point marks an open circuit, or Zn = ∞. That line along the 
equator, called the real line, includes every normalized resistance from 0 to ∞.

Introduction to Microwave Design

When the imaginary part of the impedance (called the reactance) is positive, the 
impedance lies in the northern hemisphere (Im[Zn] > 0). When the imaginary 
part of the reactance is negative, the impedance lies in the southern hemisphere 
(Im[Zn] < 0).
Plotting (and reading) an impedance from the chart requires three steps. 
Figure 2.5 shows how a normalized impedance of 0.40+j0.60Ω is plotted. First, 
the circle connected to the real part of the impedance along the real line is 
found. In Figure 2.5, a circle that connects Re(Zn) = 0.40 is drawn. Second, the 
radial line that connects to the imaginary part of the impedance is found. The 
Im(Zn) = 0.60 arc is drawn in Figure 2.5. Third, the intersection of the circle 
and the arc is the normalized impedance.
Five normalized impedances are plotted in Figure 2.6.
There are many uses of the Smith chart, but the most popular are listed 
as follows:
• To transpose between ΓL and ZL;
• To transpose between Zin and ZL;
• To transpose between impedance (Z ) and admittance (Y = 1/Z);
• To determine VSWR;
• To perform impedance matches.
A Smith chart is probably most widely used for impedance matching be­
cause it is a visual (and intuitive) way to design a circuit. Lumped elements move 
around the Smith chart as shown in Figure 2.7. Series elements are placed in 
Figure 2.4  Classic Smith chart.

line (or parallel) with the main signal path. Shunt elements are placed perpen­
dicular with the main signal (often leading to ground). Series reactive elements 
move along constant resistance circles on the impedance Smith chart since the 
resistance is unchanged. Shunt reactive elements move along the constant con­
ductance circles (the inverse of a resistance circle) since the conductance is un­
changed. Along those same lines, series resistors (which have no reactive part) 
move along the constant reactance curves, and shunt resistors move along the 
constant susceptance curves [2].
Along the border of a Smith chart is a ruler (omitted from Figure 2.7) de­
noting the magnitude of the imaginary axis (the reactance or the conductance). 
To determine how far a component will rotate around the imaginary axis, the 
equivalent impedance or admittance is calculated. The total circumference of 
the Smith chart is equivalent to a half-wavelength.

Notice that for all elements except resistors, the magnitude of the imped­
ance shift is frequency-dependent. Let’s match 50Ω to the example impedance 
presented earlier (Zn = 0.40+j0.60Ω) at 10 GHz with a system impedance 50Ω. 
There are an infinite number of ways to design a matching network. Let’s first 
use a shunt capacitor to slide on the admittance chart along the constant con­
ductance circle until we reach the constant Z = 1 resistance circle. Then, we’ll 
use a series capacitor to slide on the impedance chart along the constant resis­
tance circle to the origin.
The steps, shown in Figure 2.8, are described as follows. At Zn = 
0.40+j0.60Ω, we can see on the admittance chart, this is on the –j1.15 suscep­
tance curve. The point we want to slide to is on the –j0.42 susceptance curve. 
This delta is j0.73. Since we’re dealing with normalized impedance/admittance, 
we must divide by Zo (50) to get Yshunt,C = j0.015. Solving for C using (2.22) 
gives 0.23 pF.
From our current position, we are on the j0.55 reactance curve. We want 
to slide to the real line, so the delta is j0.55. Once we normalize to Zo, we get 
Zseries,C = 27.5. Solving for C using (2.19) gives 0.58 pF.
The final solution is a shunt 0.23 pF capacitor followed by a series 
0.58 pF capacitor to 50Ω.
2.2.3  Distributed Matching Networks
In addition to lumped-element matching networks, transmission-line based (or 
distributed) elements can also be used. Any two resistances can be matched us­
ing a quarter-wave transformer. Matching RL to Zo, for example, would require 
a transmission line of resistance 
L

load can be accomplished by first using a single stub tuner to remove the reac­
tive part, then using a quarter-wave transformer to match the resistive part.
Since quarter-wave transformers are inherently narrowband, a multisec­
tion network can be used for improved bandwidth as shown in Figure 2.11.

A three-section quarter-wave transformer can be used to match 5Ω to 
50Ω using resistances 8.5Ω, 20Ω, and 37Ω as shown in Figure 2.12. This topic 
will be discussed further in Chapter 4.
2.3  Methods of Propagation
Before we can learn how to design components that manipulate electromag­
netic energy (i.e., amplify, attenuate, filter, and radiate), we must first under­
stand how waves propagate. Electromagnetic theory explains how waves travel 
through materials and structures. There are common techniques for directing 
electromagnetic energy from one place to another. The background and equa­

tions will be explained in this chapter and used in the design examples in all 
subsequent chapters.
2.3.1  Wave Modes
Electromagnetic signals travel in waves, and there are a few different types that 
can propagate in waveguides. The type that is desired for most applications is 
the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave. TEM waves can propagate when­

ever there are two or more conductors. A closed conductive waveguide, for ex­
ample, would not support TEM propagation. Higher-order modes, including 
transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM), can propagate through 
any single-conductor or multiconductor structure.
A TE mode is present whenever the direction of propagation is perpen­
dicular to the electric field and parallel to the magnetic field. The TE mode 
is further subdivided into submodes (TEmn), where m is the number of half 
wavelengths across the broad dimension of the electric field and n is the number 
of half wavelengths across the narrow dimension. m or n can be zero if their 
respective dimension is less than a half-wavelength long.
A TM mode is present whenever the direction of propagation is perpen­
dicular to the magnetic field and parallel to the electric field. As with TE, the 
TM mode is further subdivided into submodes (TMmn), where m is the number 
of half wavelengths across the broad dimension of the magnetic field and n is 
the number of half wavelengths across the narrow dimension. m or n can be 
zero if their respective dimension is less than a half-wavelength long.
Although TEM propagates across all frequencies, higher-order modes 
only propagate at frequencies above a certain threshold, known as the cutoff 
frequency. Preventing the excitation of TE and TM modes is important because 
those signals will create mixing products with the TEM signal through multi­
plication. This will certainly degrade linearity (or spectral purity) and can even 
cause instability or catastrophic failure in active components. Ways to prevent 
higher-order mode excitation will be addressed in Part II.

2.3.2  Coaxial Cables (Coax)
The coax cable is probably the most familiar structure, because it is used to 
bring cable television into residences. Coax lines have a center conductor sur­
rounded by a grounded shield. In Figure 2.13, d is the center conductor di­
ameter, D is the inner diameter of the ground shield, and εr/μr is the relative 
permittivity/permeability of the filler material.
The electromagnetic energy is contained within the coax, so it is isolated 
from external effects. Because of its size, coax is not popular inside compact 
modules. However, it is popular in measurement benches as a way to connect 
gate and drain voltages while maintaining isolation from potential interfering 
microwave signals.
The design equations for coax lines are listed as follows. Wherever practi­
cal, approximations are included. Variables are shown in Figure 2.13 [2].

2.3.3  Microstrip
If the coax line is the most familiar structure, the microstrip line is arguably the 
most popular. Energy flows along a single conductor placed over a flat ground 
plane separated by a substrate. In Figure 2.14, the conductor has width w, 
length l, and thickness t. The substrate has thickness h, permittivity  εr, perme­
ability μr and loss tangent (tan δ) [2].
Since only one substrate is needed, microstrip lines are easy and low-cost 
to manufacture and integrate with other components. Unlike with coax, there 

34 
Radar RF Circuit Design
is no cutoff frequency, but microstrip lines are principally used below 100 GHz. 
To make circuits smaller, they can be meandered or wrapped around other 
structures.
There are, however, drawbacks to microstrip lines, and the most critical is 
power handling. Excessive voltage levels will breakdown the substrate and arc to 
ground. Excessive current levels will heat the conductor line until it delaminates 
and breaks. Substrate properties change with temperature, and if not carefully 
screened, can have a 10% variability in manufacturing tolerance.
Some substrates are less sensitive to temperature change than others. Com­
mercially available materials have values of εr that vary between approximately 
3 and 500 ppm/°C (parts-per-million/°C). In applications where temperature 
will vary greatly, this must be a material-selection criteria.
Since the signal conductor is not surrounded on all sides by dielectric, the 
mode that propagates is not pure TEM. It is often referred as quasi-TEM in 
literature. This complicates the design equations, and approximations are avail­
able for a given range of width-to-height ratios. The effective dielectric constant 
can be approximated by the Schneider-Hammerstad equation [2]:

Figure 2.15 shows the relationship between εr, εe, and Z (which of course 
determines w and h). As Z decreases, εe approaches εr . As εr increases, the effect 
on εe becomes more pronounced.

Metal thickness is often specified to handle a desired current or pow­
er level (thicker metal handles more current and power). However, the fields 
propagating from thick metal layers are different than thin metal layers, so the 
width must be adjusted to compensate for the field change. The effects of metal 
thickness are included in the equation for εe , (2.33). To determine design rules, 
the metal thickness effect has been extracted and is represented in (2.37).

When the thickness is zero, Δw is also zero. For most substrate boards, 
w/h > 1/(2π) which means Δw is only a function of the substrate height (h) and 
the metal thickness (t). Figure 2.16 plots Δw versus h at three different com­
mercially available metal thicknesses.
Practical Note
From Figure 2.16 we can generate a rule of thumb: The change in width due to metal 
thickness is approximately twice the metal thickness.
An approximation for determining characteristic line impedance from a 
known geometry (εr, h, w, t) is available when w/h is between 0.1 and 3 [4]:

Losses during signal propagation come from the conductor (conductor 
loss), the substrate (dielectric loss), and radiation losses. At high frequency, con­
ductor loss is much higher than dielectric and radiation [3].
The conductor loss can be calculated from:

Radiation loss comes from higher-order modes that propagate due to dis­
continuities that radiate energy. Discontinuities are discussed in Section 2.3.7. 
For high dielectric materials, surface wave propagation can also radiate energy 
and increase loss. Generally, if the substrate thickness is much less than 0.01 × 
λo, radiation loss is negligible.
Practical Note
Since propagation is quasi-TEM (as opposed to pure TEM), microstrip lines are often 
contained within metal or ferrite-loaded enclosures. To prevent disrupting the desired 
electric field, enclosures should be at least five times the substrate height (h) above 
the ground plane and two and a half times the conductor width (w) away from the 
conductor. This also applies to other circuit elements. 
Microstrip structures have been modified to support differential opera­
tion (explained in Chapter 4). The structure, shown in Figure 2.17, differs from 
the standard microstrip line by the addition of a second conductor spaced apart 
by gap d.
An approximation for a differential microstrip impedance (Zc,d) is avail­
able when w/h is between 0.1 and 3 [4]:

Microstrip structures can also be embedded within the substrate. This 
has the advantage of protecting the conducting material against surface damage 
(i.e., scratching or corrosion). The structure, shown in Figure 2.18, differs from 
the standard microstrip line by the addition of a layer of substrate above the 
conductor of thickness h1.

substrates.
Practical Note
Interestingly, the relationship of er to Zc,e is inverse parabolic. The er that is least af­
fected by the top-layer substrate is 6. The most affected materials have permittivity 
2.2 and 10.

Microstrip equations assume design parameters (i.e., Zo and εe) are inde­
pendent of frequency. In reality, as frequency increases, εe approaches εr . The 
effect of frequency on these parameters is called dispersion. The only way to tru­
ly determine the optimal line width for a given geometry is through full-wave

analysis. Figure 2.20 shows the change in width that is required to compensate 
for dispersion maintaining 50Ω on a 20-mil-thick substrate with permittivity 
equal to 6. Dispersion is negligible below 9 GHz and then increases approxi­
mately linearly with a slope of 0.26 mil/GHz.
2.3.4  Stripline
Like a coax, the electromagnetic energy that flows through a stripline is con­
tained within a grounded structure. Energy flows along a single conductor 
placed between two substrates with ground planes. In Figure 2.21, the con­
ductor has width w, length l, and thickness t. The substrates have thickness h, 
permittivity εr, permeability μr, and loss tan δ [2].
Since dielectric surrounds the conductor, the stripline supports pure 
TEM propagation. Therefore, the effective dielectric constant is frequency-
independent. Generally, stripline structures are used below 10 GHz. There is 
no dispersion, which makes stripline a popular option for directional couplers.
Calculating Zc for a stripline is a multistep process. First, a parameter k is 
calculated from the width and height [3].

2.3.5  Coplanar Waveguide (CPW)
A CPW requires only one substrate like a microstrip line, so it has the same cost 
and manufacturing advantages. Energy flows along a single conductor placed 
between two ground planes on the same side of the substrate. In Figure 2.24, 
the conductor has width w, ground width D, gap g, and thickness t. The sub­
strate has thickness h, permittivity εr, permeability μr, and loss tan δ [2].
Figure 2.22  Example differential stripline.
Figure 2.23  Example asymmetric stripline.

 
Introduction to Microwave Design

Since ground is on the same side as the conductor, there is no need for vias 
to ground. This makes incorporating shunt circuits much easier. Additionally, 
CPW lines have low dispersion and are commonly used to 60 GHz.
Practical Note
There is flexibility in the required ground width D. A good rule of thumb is: λ/2 > 
2D + 2g + w > 10(w + 2g).
As with microstrip lines, waves propagate within two materials in a CPW 
so an effective dielectric constant must be determined:

Practical Note
To minimize dispersion effects and suppress unwanted mode propagation, the ground 
lines should be connected by wire bonds throughout the structure and at every dis­
continuity (i.e., bends). Figure 2.25 shows an example of resolved discontinuity.
2.3.6  Waveguide
Unlike the structures we’ve discussed so far, waveguides are not fabricated on a 
substrate. Instead, they are machined from metal or another rigid material (i.e., 
silicon) and then metalized. Figure 2.26 shows a rectangular waveguide with 
width a, height b, length l, permittivity εr, and permeability μr [2].
Waveguides have the advantages of very low loss and a high power ca­
pability, and they support high-Q (narrow bandwidth relative to the center 
frequency) passive circuits. They are also physically large, expensive, and dif­
ficult to integrate. For these reasons, waveguides are not the focus of this book. 
Nevertheless, this section presents the important waveguide equations.

 
Introduction to Microwave Design

Since there is no center conductor, TEM waves cannot propagate. Instead 
TEnm and TMnm modes are present. For a waveguide, n can be 0, 1, 2, … and 
m can be 0, 1, 2, …, but n ≠ m = 0. TE10 is generally the preferred mode. 
Figure 2.27 shows what the TE and TM modes look like within the waveguide. 
That pattern repeats throughout the length of the structure, but in alternating 
direction each cycle.
The propagation constant gnm can be calculated by:

2.3.7  Discontinuities
The equations included in this chapter apply to straight, continuous, and un­
interrupted transmission lines. Whenever a deviation from this structure is in­
troduced, a potential discontinuity is introduced. This can be in the form of 
bends, gaps, width changes, thickness changes, and material changes, among 
others. Discontinuities can be purposely introduced for filtering or impedance 
matching. Often, they are added to reduce size or material cost. Depending on 
the structure, they can introduce an unwanted inductance or capacitance that 
can limit bandwidth and degrade performance.
Figure 2.28 shows the parasitic effects of four common discontinuities 
with their respective circuit model. Chapter 6 presents methods for mitigating 
these discontinuities.

2.4  Material Selection
It probably goes without saying that material selection is critical in every aspect 
and discipline of engineering. No one would ever make a bridge out of paper 
mâché or an airplane out of brick. Materials must be chosen based on the fol­
lowing factors:
• Physical properties (i.e., melting point and reflectivity);
• Electrical properties (i.e., conductivity, dielectric constant, and loss tan­
gent);
• Mechanical properties (i.e., Poisson’s ratio and fatigue resistance);
• Thermal properties (i.e., thermal expansion, specific heat, and conduc­
tivity);
• Chemical properties (i.e., corrosion, radiation, and oxidation resistance);
• Manufacturing properties (i.e., machinability and available tolerances);
• Cost (i.e., whether it meets the financial requirements);
• Availability (i.e., whether it can be procured in the time allowed);
Figure 2.28  Parasitic effects of four common discontinuities.

52 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Environmental impact (i.e., whether it contains lead).
Guidelines for material selection will be discussed throughout the book. 
It is a design parameter that is especially critical for radars due to these inherent 
characteristics of radar:
• Concentration of heat in small areas;
• Fluctuation of electrical and environmental conditions;
• Requirements for cost reduction;
• Low tolerance for failure;
• Long expected lifetime;
• Severe operating conditions.
This section provides an overview of materials commonly used in compo­
nent design. The appendix lists tables of material properties.
2.4.1  Semiconductors
Semiconductors provide the backbone for monolithic microwave integrated 
circuits (MMICs), which are the RF equivalent of the integrated circuits found 
in everyday digital chips. Common semiconductors used in microwave radar 
components include Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and Gallium Nitride (GaN). 
Semiconductors tend to have the following material characteristics [5]:
• They are poor conductors of electricity;
• They have a high temperature stability;
• Their purity can be implemented to within a few impurity atoms for 
every billion host atoms (parts-per-billion, ppb);
• They are chemically resistant.
2.4.2  Metals
Metals are both electrically and thermally conductive. They are used as the 
conductive material for signal and ground lines. Depending on the application, 
metal lines can be deposited by sputtering, evaporating, electroplating, or roll­
ing. They are also used as the carrier or base plate metal to spread heat and add 
mechanical stability. Common metals used in microwave radar components are 
gold (Au), copper (Cu), and aluminum (Al). Metals tend to offer the following 
material properties [5]:

 
Introduction to Microwave Design 
53
• They are excellent conductors of both electricity and heat;
• They are relatively strong;
• They are highly dense;
• They are malleable;
• They are resistant to cracking;
• They are resistant to breaking when subjected to high-impact forces.
Microwave signals do not propagate equally throughout a volume of con­
ductive material. The amplitude of the field as it decays within a conductor can 
be calculated by: 
	
/ s
d
d
A
e
δ
-
=
	
(2.86)
where Ad is the magnitude of field strength present (maximum is 1 or 100% 
field remaining), d is the depth into the material from the surface (m), and δs 
is the skin depth (m).
The skin depth is the depth within a conductive surface where most of the 
current flows, and it is calculated by:
	
1
s
f
δ
π μσ
=
	
(2.87)
where f is frequency, μ is permeability, and σ is conductivity loss. More than 
one-third of the propagating signal is absorbed at depths beyond the skin depth 
so it is important to choose a metal and metal thickness sufficient to support 
the radar signals needed.
2.4.3  Ceramics
Ceramics are available with a wide array of properties. For example, thermal 
conductivity ranges from nearly perfectly insulating (i.e., space shuttle tiles dur­
ing re-entry) to more conductive than metal (i.e., carbon-based nanocompos­
ites). Ceramics tend to offer the following material properties [5]:
• They are generally composed of both metallic and nonmetallic elements;
•  They are poor conductors of electricity;
• Their thermal conductivity can range from very poor to superior to 
metal;
•  They are stronger than metal, but brittle under impact force;

54 
Radar RF Circuit Design
•  They are high-temperature-stable;
•  They are chemically resistant.
2.4.4  Polymers
Polymers are generally used as low-cost packaging and sealing materials. Many 
are specifically designed for high-frequency or military applications. Although 
there are many exceptions, polymers tend to offer the following material prop­
erties [5]:
• They soften at high temperature;
• They are inexpensive to make;
• They are low-density;
• They are malleable;
• They are chemically resistant.
2.4.5  New and Emerging Technologies
New materials have brought new life to old (perhaps stale) technologies. Com­
panies are taking existing designs and porting them to new materials with im­
provements like lower loss, higher permittivity, lower cost, better uniformity, 
and improved robustness. New designs can leverage the advancements that have 
been made and that are being made every day. Some of the most exciting new 
and emerging materials are described as follows.
Electrically Conductive Polymers
Polymers provide low-cost and low-loss packaging options. Unfortunately, since 
they are nonmetallic, they do not provide shielding (discussed in Chapter 8). In 
highly integrated assemblies, this can cause crosstalk among components. Elec­
trically conductive polymers are being introduced that provide the moldability 
and cost savings of polymers with the shielding properties of metal. Several 
polymers, including polyacetylene, polyparaphenylene, polypyrrole, polyani­
line, and polythiophene, can be made conductive. Alternatively, other polymers 
can be made conductive by filling with conductive materials (i.e., silicone rub­
ber or silver particles).
Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP)
LCP has a number of unique properties. First, it operates with very low loss 
up to 110 GHz making it applicable for millimeter-wave applications. Second, 
it is hydrophobic so moisture is not absorbed into the material. This allows

it to maintain electrical properties even in humid environments. Third, it is 
equally qualified to be both a substrate and a packaging material. Commercial 
fabricators can now assemble structures with more than 10 layers with preci­
sion. Fourth, it is a flexible material that has been used to make conformal 
electronics.
High-Permittivity Substrates
Circuit size is inversely proportional to the permittivity. Circuits are inherently 
smaller on higher-permittivity substrates than lower-permittivity substrates. As 
the need for smaller components increases, the use of these high-permittivity 
substrates becomes more prevalent. Materials doped with hafnium and beryl­
lium are gaining in popularity and can have permittivity of 30–100. The draw­
back to increased permittivity is usually higher loss.
Robust Substrates
Companies that produce microwave substrates are making materials geared to­
ward military applications. Some offer temperature stability (very little change 
in performance versus temperature). Others, like LCP, operate well in harsh 
environments. The best manufactures make these changes without sacrificing 
loss (tan δ) or cost.
Diamond
When thermal management is critical and cost is secondary, there is no better 
heat spreader on the market than diamond. Sheets of diamond are commercial­
ly available with thermal conductivity up to a staggering 1,800 W/m·K. This is 
nearly five times more conductive than pure copper. Diamond is electrically an 
insulator so before using it as a thermal spreader, all sides must be metalized to 
preserve the ground plane.

Component Modeling
The behavior of all microwave components, including those listed in Table 1.2, 
can be expressed mathematically. Behavior can be categorized by the frequency 
response (how it behaves over frequency), transient response (how it behaves 
over time), small-signal response (how it behaves at low input power level), and 
large-signal response (how it behaves at high input power level).  
For complicated components or components with many ports, work­
ing with a system of equations to model the behavior can be cumbersome. To 
simplify the design process, equivalent circuit models are derived using basic 
electrical elements, including capacitors, inductors, resistors, transmission lines 
(discussed in Chapter 2), voltage sources, and current sources. Each of those 
basic elements can be described by a much more manageable set of equations. 
This chapter presents equivalent circuit models that describe the electrical 
behavior of components at microwave frequencies, including unwanted effects 
caused by the physical structure (i.e., packaging effects). Those models are then 
combined to generate a circuit model for a transistor—arguably one of the most 
complicated components used by a microwave designer. The model serves as an 
example to explain some of the physical traits of a transistor, which will be lev­
eraged in Chapters 4 and 5 (amplifier design). The process for deriving custom 
models is also explained.
3.1  Passive Modeling
Lumped or surface-mount elements are attractive due to their small size, broad 
bandwidth, and commercial availability compared with distributed elements. 
At low frequencies, component size is very small compared to the wavelength. 
Therefore, they can be used with minimal concern. However, at higher frequen­

60 
Radar RF Circuit Design
cies (UHF and above), this is not the case. Lumped elements exhibit spurious 
resonances, fringing fields (radiation leakage), loss, and other parasitic (unde­
sired) effects (discussed in Chapter 6) [1]. 
3.1.1  Capacitor
The equivalent circuit model of a lumped-element capacitor is shown in Fig­
ure 3.1 where Cnom is the nominal capacitance, Ls is the series parasitic induc­
tance, ESR is the equivalent series resistance, and Cp is the parallel parasitic 
capacitance.
Fortunately, data sheets often include one or more of these parameters 
to aid designers. If not, S-parameters are usually available so that values can be 
tuned to match the frequency response. Figure 3.2 shows the effect Ls has on the 
capacitor frequency response. The Ls = 0.000 curve has no parasitic effect. As Ls 
increases, the high-frequency response degrades quickly. 
Some components are marketed as having “low ESR.” They are designed 
for high-frequency applications. Having a low ESR will reduce the loss, espe­
cially at high frequency.
Sometimes data sheets quantify the loss of capacitor by its quality factor 
(Q), which is defined as:

where f is the frequency (hertz), Cnom is the nominal capacitance (farads), and 
ESR is the series resistance (W). This equation can be used to calculate ESR.
Data sheets may also specify the series-resonant frequency (SRF) of a ca­
pacitor. This is the frequency where Cnom and Ls are equal, but opposite in 
magnitude. At that frequency, the capacitor behaves like a parallel RC circuit 
with ESR and Cp. To calculate Ls from SRF, the following equation can be used:

Cp accounts for any deviation from the frequency response that cannot 
be predicted. It is determined by trial and error until the measured frequency 
response matched the equivalent circuit model. 
3.1.2  Inductor
The equivalent circuit model of a lumped-element inductor is shown in Figure 
3.3 where Lnom is the nominal inductance, ESR is the parallel resistance, and Cp 
is the parallel parasitic capacitance.
Sometimes data sheets quantify the loss of inductor by its quality factor 
(Q), which is defined as:

where f is the frequency (Hz), L is the inductance (henrys), and R is the series 
resistance (Ω). This equation can be used to calculate R. R can also be measured 
directly with an ohmmeter. If the inductor is comprised of a coil of wire, R can 
be approximated from the resistivity of the metal:

where Rskin is the skin-effect resistance (2.44), l is the wire length (approxi­
mately equal to the number of turns multiplied by the coil circumference plus 
the lead length), and d is the wire diameter. 
Data sheets may also specify the SRF of an inductor. To calculate Cp from 
SRF, the following equation may be used:

response matched the equivalent circuit model. 
Wire bonds used to connect components together are another source of 
inductance in a circuit. There are many models that approximate the behavior 
of a wire. A simple, but popular model that determines the inductance of a 
straight wire based on physical parameters is [2]:

When the wire is used on the surface of a substrate, the proximity to the 
ground plane (discussed in Chapter 2) can have an effect. This is particularly 
true for long wires or thin substrates (less than 5 mils). Equation (3.7) shows 
the added complexity when ground effects are considered [2].

These equations do not take into account the height or shape of the bond 
wire arch. Design software packages include sophisticated bond wire models 
that take into consideration the substrate properties and geometry of the bond 
wire.
Practical Note
For a 1-mil wire, the equivalent inductance is largely related to substrate thickness and 
the bond wire height (the apex of the arch). Figure 3.4 shows a plot demonstrating a 
good rule of thumb relationship.
The inductance of a wire can be reduced by replacing it with a wider 
structure called a ribbon. The inductance of a ribbon can be calculated from [2]:

3.1.3  Resistor
The equivalent circuit model of a lumped-element resistor is shown in Figure 
3.5 where Rnom is the nominal resistance, Ls is the series parasitic inductance, 
and Cp is the parallel parasitic capacitance.
As is the case with capacitors and inductors, resistors have a frequency 
range where the parasitics overcome the resistance. Ls and Cp can be determined 
if SRF information is provided from the vendor, or through trial and error until 
the measured frequency response matches the model. 
3.1.4  Resonators
Resistors, inductors, and/or capacitors can be combined in series or parallel 
to make circuits with very sharp frequency responses. A circuit might pass all 
frequencies except for a very narrow band or might reject all frequencies ex­
cept for a very narrow band. Resonators are widely used in filters, so they will 
be discussed extensively in Chapter 6. Since they are also used in amplifiers 
and matching networks, their important design equations are included in this 
section.
The frequency of both series and parallel resistor, inductor, and capacitor 
(RLC) circuits is determined by:

As soon as a component is attached to a transmission line by way of soldering 
or epoxying to a pad of metal, the effects of the attachment must be consid­
ered. This is generally modeled as a set of pads (called the footprint) spaced the 
same distance apart as the component ports. Table 3.1 lists typical pad sizes 
along with their respective approximate capacitance (footprints vary by manu­
facturer). The frequency where the pad exhibits behavior other than a pure

Chapter 6 discusses rules for laying out circuits to prevent coupling or set 
a desired level of coupling.
3.3  Transistor Modeling
The heart of an active circuit is the transistor. It is the component that uses 
DC power to amplify an RF signal. Chapter 2 discussed how a poor match can 
add loss. Transistors have an additional layer of complexity. The impedance 
presented at the input and output has a profound effect on the behavior of the 
transistor (this is discussed in Chapter 4). Additionally, its performance is de­
termined by the DC bias applied and level of input RF power. To be effective, 
a transistor model must accurately represent this multidimensional trade space. 
This section reviews pertinent information about semiconductors and transis­
tor operation.
3.3.1  Semiconductor Background
Materials of interest for transistors (and other electronics) can be categorized 
as either conductors, insulators, or semiconductors. Conductors are generally 
metals, and have resistivity less than 10–3 Ω·cm. Silicon dioxide is an example of 
an insulator used commonly in silicon transistors. Insulators can have resistivity 
of more than 105 Ω·cm. Semiconductors, as the name implies, are all materials 
between conductors and insulators. The resistivity of a homogeneous material 
(one type of material is used throughout the object) is determined by:
	
2
m
e n
ρ
τ
=
	
(3.19)
where ρ is the resistivity (Ω·m), m is the electron mass (9.11 × 10–31 kg), e is the 
fundamental charge (1.602 × 10–19 C), n is the number of charge carriers per 
unit volume, and τ is the mean time between collisions of the charge carriers. 
The resistivity of pure copper is 1.7 × 10–8 Ω·m. The resistivity of pure gold is 
2.4 × 10–8 Ω·m. Gold is approximately 40% more resistive than copper, which 
is why copper traces have gold plating (to prevent oxidation) is the preferred 
metal configuration for microwave components. The appendix presents a table 
of resistivity. 
Nearly all RF transistors used in radars today are compound semiconduc­
tors, meaning they are formed by two or more elements. Generally, the most 
common transistors come from elements in the third and fifth columns of the 

68 
Radar RF Circuit Design
periodic table so they are known as III-V (pronounced “three five”) transis­
tors. The most popular semiconductors for radar are gallium arsenide (GaAs), 
gallium nitride (GaN), and indium phosphide (InP). The advantages of these 
materials will be discussed in Part II.
A semiconductor is often classified by its bandgap energy (or just band­
gap). It is known from quantum mechanics that electrons surround the atom 
at various discrete bands or energy states. Energy states where the electrons 
are bound to a particular atom are called valence bands. Energy states outside 
the valance band where electrons can flow freely from atom to atom within a 
lattice are called conduction bands. The energy differential between the lowest 
conduction band and the highest valence band is the bandgap. A perfect metal 
would have zero bandgap, and a perfect insulator would have infinite bandgap. 
In general, semiconductors have bandgaps less than 2.5 eV and insulators have 
bandgaps greater than 2.5 eV [3]. 
Practical Note
Bandgap values vary from foundry to foundry, so always ask before doing any kind of 
analysis that requires this information. The bandgap of GaN, for example, can vary 
from 1.5 to 3 eV for commercial processes. Chapter 7 discusses how this difference 
can have a profound effect on reliability and stability. For example, the difference can 
change the necessary burn-in time (operational time required before the performance 
of an active component remains constant) by more than 20 times (see Chapter 7).
Charge-carrier mobility, conductivity, and the number of charge carriers 
vary with temperature. For these reasons, the effects of temperature play an im­
portant role in transistor behavior and should be included in any model. 
3.3.2  Basic Transistor Theory Review
At the simplest level, transistors generate an electric field from a DC bias and 
when an RF signal passes through that electric field, it is amplified. There are 
many different types of transistors, each with strengths and weaknesses. Several 
transistors with their electrical symbol are listed as follows:
• Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs);
• Heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs);
• Metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs);
• Laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductors (LDMOS);
• Metal semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs);
• High electron mobility transistors (HEMTs).

 
Component Modeling 
69
BJTs utilize electrons and holes (absence of an electron) as charge carriers. 
Regions concentrated with electrons and holes are created by doping a semicon­
ductor with impurities. When a BJT is biased, the charge carriers flow (diffuse) 
across the junction. BJTs are commonly used in analog circuits, but they are 
also popular for use up to S-band for microwave applications [4]. 
Rather than create regions with electrons and holes, a similar effect can be 
attained by using multiple materials with different bandgaps called heterojunc­
tions. An HBT can operate to well above 100 GHz. BJTs and HBTs made on 
silicon offer extremely low cost, high manufacturing yields, high gain, and low 
noise. Since silicon is a poor thermal conductor, BJTs and HBTs are generally 
impractical for high-power radars.
MOSFETs can deliver a lot of power and are still commonly used today 
to deliver 10s of amps into a load. They are generally limited to lower-frequency 
applications (L-band and below) due to high parasitic capacitance. LDMOS 
was developed to reduce the parasitic capacitance to enable operation to C-
band [4].
MESFETs further improved the layout to enable operation to millimeter-
wave (mm-wave). They were the transistor of choice for microwave applications, 
especially radar, for decades. Today, they are losing market share to HEMTs.
HEMT devices offer higher gain, lower noise, and higher operating fre­
quency than MESFET at a competitive cost. Indium is commonly used as a 
heterojunction material because it improves high-frequency performance. GaN 
HEMTs have a heterojunction capable of supporting high power density. Since 
heterojunctions use materials with different bandgaps, they also have a different 
lattice size (spacing between atoms). This leads to discontinuities at the atomic 
layer that can “trap” charge, and this degrades device performance. Creating a 
smooth interface between the materials is a challenge, and there are two com­
mon approaches.  A pseudomorphic HEMT (pHEMT) uses a very thin layer 
of one of the materials in the heterojunction, which allows the atomic structure 
to stretch. Alternatively, a metamorphic HEMT (or mHEMT) uses a buffer 
material in the middle of the heterojunction to fill in the gaps. Both approaches 
support higher-frequency operation.
Figure 3.6 shows a general small-signal (linear) model for a transistor. It is 
a three-port (or three-terminal) circuit with gate, drain, and source. Each port 
has a respective capacitance (Cg, Cd, Cs), inductance (Lg, Ld, Ls), and resistance 
(Rg, Rd, Rs). Additionally, each port has coupled parameters (Cgs, Cds, Cgd, Rgs, 
Rds, Rgd). There is also an input resistance (Ri) and a junction resistance (Rj). The 
voltage-controlled current source is related to the transconductance [gm, defined 
in (3.20)] and the frequency (f ) [4].
gm can be calculated by:

From (3.22), (3.23), and (3.24), we can see that in order to operate at 
higher frequencies, transistor designers (usually device physicists) can do the 
following: 
• Decrease Cgs, Cgd;
• Decrease Rg, Ri, Rs;
• Decrease Ls.
These parameters can be modified by changing the channel doping con­
centration, gate width, channel thickness, gate length, source-gate-drain spac­
ing, and the layer structure. Figure 3.7 shows an example of a GaAs HEMT 
cross section.
In a depletion-mode device, a conductive channel between the source and 
drain exists when 0V is applied to the gain (the device is nominally ON). The 
transistor is in the saturated region. As a negative voltage is applied to the gate, 
the transistor enters the linear region when the drain current varies with Vgs and 
Vds. The transistor is essentially a voltage-controlled resistor (the word transistor 
is a contraction of transfer resistor). If the gate voltage is driven further negative, 

72

the channel will be shut off, and no drain current will flow. This is the cutoff 
region.  
To map out the relationship between drain current (Id), Vgs, and Vds, an 
IV plot (current-voltage plot) can be made. Figure 3.8 provides an example of 
a IV plot [5].
The knee voltage (Vknee) marks the transition between the linear region 
(on the left) to the saturated region (on the right). The maximum current pos­
sible is denoted IMAX. The saturated current level where Vg = 0 is called IDSS. 
In the cutoff region, the drain current should become zero. Any current that 
continues to flow is leakage. In most cases, leakage is undesired and can be a 
sign of device failure. Some foundry processes have a small amount of drain cur­
rent leakage, which is fine for amplifier applications, but the transistor cannot 
be used as a switch.
In an enhancement-mode device, the channel between the source and 
drain does not exist when 0V is applied to the gate (the device is nominally 
OFF). In this case, a positive voltage is applied to the gate to activate the chan­

nel. The same terminology and IV curve characteristics as a depletion-mode 
device are also applicable for enhancement-mode devices.
3.3.3  Transistor Imperfections
Semiconductor wafers can be grown with extraordinary purity (measured in 
parts per billion). However, the layers that are deposited above the semicon­
ductor will always have some defects. The epitaxial growth process responsible 
for adding the main transistor layers can introduce vacancies (missing atoms), 
interstitials (atoms in the wrong place), and impurities (undesired atoms) in the 
lattice structure. These defects can cause the following[3]:
• Current and voltage leakage;
• Deviation from normal behavior (generally from the trapping of impu­
rities);
• Additional loss;
• Reduced frequency response;
• Catastrophic failure.
Foundries minimize defects during fabrication by carefully monitoring 
the following:
• Substrate and process temperature;
• Chamber pressure;
• Growth precursors;
• Wafer precleaning recipes.
Foundries tend to develop reputations for generating transistors with high 
reliability and low device-to-device variation. This is especially important in 
large AESA radars where uniformity across the structure is critical. 
3.4  Custom Models
Models provided by component vendors should ideally be valid under all con­
ditions (i.e., all substrates, frequencies, temperatures, and biases). Trying to 
represent the behavior accurately over the infinite trade space is impractical. 
Therefore, vendors optimize their models to be as broad reaching as possible. 
In doing so, compromise in advertised accuracy is made. For this reason, many 

74 
Radar RF Circuit Design
designers choose to extract their own component models and optimize them for 
only the specific operating conditions required.
From measured data, a custom mathematical model can be created. Data 
that follows a line, parabola, or polynomial can be fitted to an equation using 
algebra. 
It may be noticed that many of the mathematical models presented 
throughout this book leverage trigonometry (trig) or polynomial functions. 
When measurements are made of the natural world, the behavior tends to 
mimic a trend represented mathematically by a trig or polynomial function. 
Therefore, deriving a custom model starts by visually comparing the natural 
behavior against the library of functions, which are plotted in Figures 3.9–3.17 
for convenience.

Component Modeling 
75
Once a suitable function is found, trial and error can be used to fit the 
model to the data.
3.5  Measurement Techniques
Using models to represent measured data offers design flexibility. Models can 
be scaled, tuned, and updated as needed. They offer superb resolution since pa­
rameters can be swept in small steps. Monte Caro analysis (discussed in Chapter 
7) can be used to assess performance yield from tolerances.
However, if none of this flexibility is needed, modern simulators sup­
port the use of measurement files directly in the analysis. Various routines are

76 
Radar RF Circuit Design
available to extrapolate data or interpolate between steps. A measured S‑param­
eter file (i.e., SnP file, where “n” is the number of ports) can be used in place of a 
small-signal (low-power) model. In place of a large-signal (high-power) model, 
load-pull measurements can be performed on a transistor to determine the ideal 
matching and bias conditions. Figure 3.18 shows a simple load-pull setup. Im­
pedance tuners are placed at the input and output of the transistor. The tuners 
are controlled by a computer (not shown) to move around the Smith chart 
and record the input power, output power, and bias information. Once the

impedance plane has been covered, the optimal gain/power or efficiency imped­
ances are known. Rather than simulating with a device model, it is possible to 
design matching networks that present those measured impedances. 
Many designers find this design approach too limiting since there is no 
flexibility in the bias (a measured data set is taken at one bias). However, for 
quick “down and dirty” designs, this approach is appropriate. 
To assess stability, it is important to replace the transistor with an S2P 
(two-port S-parameter) file. This will provide the gain and match information 
needed (discussed in Chapter 4).

Power Amplifier
One could argue that the power amplifier is the cornerstone of the active radar. 
Reviewing the equations for SNRsearch and SNRtrack in Chapter 1, the ampli­
fier is the component that directly influences transmit power, system loss, noise 
figure, and frequency. It also consumes the most prime power and generates the 
most heat. It should come as no surprise that the bulk of new radar nonrecur­
ring engineering (NRE) expense is often invested in the amplifier design.
One subject often overlooked by other amplifier design textbooks is the 
effect of mechanical constraints. As amplifiers achieve higher power in smaller 
volume, mitigating thermal effects becomes just as important as meeting electri­
cal requirements. As thermal and environmental stress rise, so must the impor­
tance placed on mitigating mechanical effects. The best microwave component 
designers will have a basic understanding of mechanical engineering (and vice 
versa). For this reason, Chapter 4 presents both the electrical and mechanical 
aspects of power amplifier design for radar applications.
4.1  Amplifier Basics
Defining the specifications of an amplifier requires more metrics than just fre­
quency, power, gain, efficiency, and linearity. Other important specifications 
include the following (listed in no particular order):
• Gain flatness over the operating band;
• Frequency roll-off characteristics out of band;
• Stability;
• VSWR (or return loss);

88 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Dynamic range;
• Prime power available (or power added efficiency, PAE);
• Linear phase response;
• Operating temperature;
• Duty cycle or peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR);
• Leakage current;
• Blanking requirement;
• Multifunctionality;
• Reconfigurability;
• Level of technology maturity;
• Sensitivity to production variation;
• Form factor;
• Bias available;
• Cost.
Practical Note
Unfortunately, specifications rarely include everything that a designer needs or wants 
to know. Or, specifications include the appropriate line items, but they are marked 
with “to be determined” or “TBD.” This should not be confused with “not specified” 
or “NS.” The former indicates there will be a specification, but one wasn’t available at 
the time of printing. The latter indicates there will not be a specification.
  There was once a specification generated for a high-power amplifier for a naval ship 
with an efficiency of “NS.” When asked about it, the commander mentioned that he 
had twin 20-MW electric motors and an ocean full of cold water—efficiency wasn’t 
a concern!
A schematic of the basic amplifier is shown in Figure 4.1. At the input is 
a voltage (RF) source, which represents the incoming signal. A capacitor (Cblock) 
serves as a DC block to protect the RF source from over-current exposure. An 
input-matching network presents the ideal impedance to the transistor input. 
A gate voltage (Vg) is connected to the gate of a transistor through an induc­
tor (Lblock). The inductor serves as an RF block (or RF choke) to isolate the DC 
source from the amplifier. In some cases, Lblock can be replaced with a large resis­
tor or a combination of the two. On the transistor, the gate is at the input, the 
drain is at the output, and the source is grounded (known as a common-source 
configuration). The network at the output of the transistor is similar to that at 
the input. An output-matching network presents the ideal impedance to the 

 
Power Amplifier 
89
transistor output. The drain voltage (Vd) is connected to the drain through an 
RF choke. A DC blocking capacitor protects the load (RL ) from excess DC bias.

In order to properly isolate the DC sources (Vg, Vd), an adequate induc­
tance (Lblock) must be chosen so the impedance “seen” looking into the DC 
source from the amplifier is very large. This can be calculated from:

where Lblock is the RF choke inductance (henrys), R is the desired resistance (W), 
and fmin is the maximum design frequency. R should be a large value. Choos­
ing at least 20 times Zo is usually adequate. For example, a 16-nH inductance 
would provide 1,000-Ω resistance at 10 GHz. For narrowband applications, 
Lblock can be replaced with a quarter-wave transmission line.
Similarly, the values for the DC-blocking capacitors (Cblock) must be care­
fully chosen to prevent unnecessary attenuation of the input RF signal. The 
resistance provided by the blocking capacitor can be calculated from:

where Cblock is the DC blocking capacitance (F), R is the desired resistance (W), 
and fmin is the minimum design frequency. R should be a small value. Choos­
ing 1/200 times Zo is usually adequate. For example, a 64-pF capacitor would 
provide 0.25-Ω resistance at 10 GHz. 
Amplifiers are often categorized into classes to help convey the type of 
design technique used. In conversation, the mere mention of a class can give 
an impression to the listener of output power, efficiency, linearity, frequency 
limitations, and SWAP-C. The most popular classes for RF amplifiers are A, B, 
AB, C, E, and F, as described in Sections 4.1.1–4.1.6. 
4.1.1  Class A
Class A is the most linear of the classes. It is often used as a gain stage since it 
offers high gain and doesn’t degrade the linearity and noise figure of the later 
stages. Figure 4.2 shows the operation [1]. Recall that the gate is the transistor 
input and that the drain is the transistor output. 
The current IDQ is biased at 50% of IMAX, which puts it along the middle 
of the IV plane. The voltage VDQ is set near the center of the IV plane and 
should be less than half the breakdown voltage (< VBR /2) of the transistor. The 
load line is drawn on the Id–Vd plot from the knee voltage on the highest cur­
rent trace through the normal operating bias (called the Q-point) to the X-axis. 
During operation, the voltage moves (swings) along the load line. The decreas­
ing voltage (Vswing,-) will swing between Vknee and VDQ. Just like a pendulum, the 
increasing voltage (Vswing,+) will have the same magnitude as Vswing,-, but in the 

 
Power Amplifier 
91
opposite direction. The maximum drain voltage is labeled VMAX. The peak-to-
peak voltage (Vpp) is calculated from VMAX – Vknee or 2Vswing,–.
A similar behavior happens with the current swing. The increasing cur­
rent Iswing,+ will swing between Iknee and IDQ. The decreasing current Iswing,- will 
have the same magnitude as Iswing,+, but in the opposite direction. Since IDQ is 
set to 50% IMAX, the current swing should never need to go below 0 A. 
The voltage and current swing can simultaneously be plotted on the 
transconductance (Id-Vg) plot. As shown, the swing is wholly contained within 
the linear region of the transconductance curve. This gives a Class A amplifier 
unique qualities, described as follows:
• A Class A amplifier operates in a linear mode, by definition.
• The input power level must not exceed Pmax/2, where Pmax is defined in 
(4.7). This will allow a class A amplifier to continuously conduct (100% 
of the voltage swing is above 0A so it always draws power). Said another 
way, it has a conduction angle of 360° (it is always conducting).
• Since Class A is always “on,” there is no “turn on” time required.
• The theoretical maximum efficiency is 50%.

where Vpp is the peak-to-peak voltage (V) and Ipp is the peak-to-peak current 
(A).
To increase Pmax, VDQ should also be maximized as long as VMAX is less 
than the breakdown voltage of the transistor. Damage will occur to the transis­
tor if the operating voltage exceeds breakdown.
For maximum power, the load impedance should be set to:

4.1.2  Class B
Class B is not as linear as Class A, but it is significantly more efficient (theoreti­
cal max is 78.5%). It is often used in a push-pull configuration (explained in 
Section 4.3.3). The operation is shown in Figure 4.3 [1]. 
The current IDQ is biased at pinch-off, which puts it along the bottom 
of the IV plane. As with Class A, the voltage VDQ is set near the center of the 
IV plane and should be less than half the breakdown voltage (< VBR/2) of the 
transistor. The load line is drawn on the Id-Vd plot from the knee voltage on the 
highest current trace through the Q-point to the X-axis. During operation, the 
voltage swings in the same manner as Class A.
The current behavior is quite different. The increasing current Iswing,+ will 
still swing between Iknee and IDQ. However, like a pendulum, the decreasing cur­
rent Iswing,- wants to swing negative, but Id does not go negative—it stays at 0 A. 
This is best seen when plotted on the transconductance (defined in Chapter 3) 
plot. Half the time, current is conducting and half the time the current is 0 A. 
This gives a Class B amplifier unique qualities, described as follows:
• Since the voltage swing is nonlinear, an amplifier operating Class B will 
also be nonlinear.
• A Class B amplifier is conducting half the time (50% of the voltage 
swing is above 0A). Said another way, it has a conduction angle of 180°.
• Since conducting angle is less than 360°, gain will be less than Class A 
(it must be driven with more input power to achieve maximum output 
power).

VMAX is less than the breakdown voltage of the transistor.

Transistors have both forward and reverse breakdown voltages. As men­
tioned previously, VDQ must be chosen to ensure VMAX does not exceed the 
breakdown voltage (with some margin). On the transconductance plot, if the 
voltage swings too far to the left (very negative Vg), Id will begin to conduct 
again. Designers must also ensure that Vg stays above the reverse breakdown 
voltage of the transistor.
To maximize efficiency, Class B amplifiers can shape the voltage wave­
forms to decrease the dissipated power within the transistor. This can be ac­
complished by terminating all harmonics with a short circuit (SC). In Figure 
4.4, a parallel shunt LC circuit has been added to provide a SC at 2fo and 3fo. 
This helps shape the output waveform into a sinusoid.
Figure 4.4  Example Class B schematic.

94 
Radar RF Circuit Design
4.1.3  Class AB
Class AB strives to compromise between the linearity of Class A and the ef­
ficiency of Class B. It is arguably the most commonly used configuration. The 
operation is shown in Figure 4.5 [1].
The current (IDQ) is biased between pinch-off and 50% of IMAX. Often, it 
is set to 25% of IMAX, but can range between 5 and 30%. As with Class A and 
Class B, the voltage (VDQ) is set near the center of the IV plane and should be 
less than half the breakdown voltage (< VBR /2) of the transistor. The load line 
is drawn on the Id-Vd plot from the knee voltage on the highest current trace 
through the Q-point to the X-axis. During operation, the voltage swings in the 
same manner as class A and class B.
The increasing current (Iswing,+) will still swing between Iknee and IDQ. In 
this case, the decreasing current (Iswing,-) cannot make a full swing (like Class 
A) but it can swing more than Class B. This is best seen when plotted on the 
transconductance plot. More than half the time, current is conducting, but part 
of the swing is at 0A. 
This gives a Class AB amplifier unique qualities, listed as follows:
• Linearity is between Class A and Class B;
• Efficiency is between Class A and Class B (between 50 and 78.5%);
• Gain is between Class A and Class B;
• It has a conduction angle between 180° and 360°.

To maximize efficiency, Class AB amplifiers can shape the voltage wave­
forms to decrease the dissipated power within the transistor. This can be accom­
plished by terminating all harmonics with an SC. The same Class B schematic 
applies to Class AB.
4.1.4  Class C
Class C is operated well below pinch-off. This gives it the best efficiency and 
the worst linearity of the classes presented so far. Due to its nonlinear nature, it 
is limited to frequency- or phase-modulated waveforms or applications with a 
liberal linearity requirement. The operation is shown in Figure 4.6 [1].
It is biased deep into pinch-off so without a large-signal RF signal applied, 
it is off. In comparison with the other classes, only a small positive current 
(Iswing,+) swing is achieved under input drive. Class C also benefits from har­
monic matching, like Class B. This gives a Class C amplifier unique qualities, 
outlined as follows:
• Linearity is worse than Class B;
• Efficiency is better than Class B (up to 81%);
• Gain is less than Class B;
• It has a conduction angle less than 180° (typically 90–120°).

Practical Note
Measuring S-parameters on a Class C amplifier will not show gain (S21), which can 
cause great confusion during measurements. Input power must be driven to draw cur­
rent and see RF gain.
4.1.5  Harmonically Matched Classes
Class AB, Class B, and Class C can benefit from harmonically matched out­
puts. Providing an SC impedance at the harmonics shapes the voltage wave­
forms within the transistor to reduce current and voltage overlap and reduce 
the dissipated power (Pdiss = Id · Vd). Some classes use this principle to attempt 
to eliminate all current and voltage overlap to approach a theoretical 100% 
efficiency.
Class E is the first of several topologies with a theoretical 100% efficiency. 
The transistor is terminated with a high-Q circuit to provide a reactive load at 
fo and open circuit at 2fo and 3fo. A perfect implementation causes the transistor 
to switch on and off, giving it very precise waveforms (hence the term switch-
mode amplifier). This precision minimizes voltage/current overlap and provides 
very high efficiency. Unfortunately, realizing a Class E amplifier in practice is 
very challenging and limiting. The high-Q circuit limits the operating frequen­
cy range to very narrow bandwidth. The switching speed must be fast compared 
with the frequency, which limits operation to low frequencies (L-band or below 
principally). For these reasons, Class E is not widely used.
Class F (and its inverse, Class F–1) is gaining in popularity because it 
works well at microwave frequencies. The ideal Class F will have all odd har­
monics terminated in an open circuit and all even harmonics terminated in a 
short circuit. Class F–1 terminates all odd harmonics with a short circuit and all 
even harmonics with an open circuit. Ideally, both input and output will follow 
this termination scheme, although in practice the focus is on the output. Figure 
4.7 shows a circuit approach for Class F [1].
In the circuit shown in Figure 4.7, L1 and C1 resonate at fo, L3 and C3 
resonate at 3fo, and C2 provides blocking and compensation for parasitics (if 
any). These values can be calculated by [1]:

where C3 is the capacitance (F), L3 is the previously calculated inductance (H),

Class F can also be implemented using distributed instead of lumped ele­
ments. In either implementation, two factors, detailed in the following, make 
100% efficiency unobtainable in practice.
• Individual elements (i.e., capacitors, inductors, and transmission lines) 
have parasitics, which prevent achieving perfect open and SCs.
Figure 4.7  Example class F schematic.

Radar RF Circuit Design
• Terminating all harmonics would require an infinite number of elements 
(which in itself is impractical). In addition to parasitics, real elements 
have loss. Eventually, the benefit of terminating additional harmonics is 
outweighed by the loss of adding more elements.
For these reasons, most implementations do not handle input harmonics 
and only terminate 2fo and 3fo on the output. Some will terminate 2fo on the 
input and 4fo on the output. 
Practical Note
Although achieving Class F over very broad bandwidth is not practical, it is generally 
suitable for radar bandwidths (up to 1 GHz).
4.1.6  Do Classes Really Matter?
Understanding how classes work is an important step in learning amplifier de­
sign. It will help gain an intuition between the balance of bias, impedance ter­
mination, output power (or gain), efficiency, and linearity. In conversation, if 
someone says he or she is targeting Class AB operation, it is universally known 
throughout the amplifier design community what that means. 
That said, when it comes to designing amplifiers, the answer to Section 
4.1.6’s title question is (ultimately) no. Specifications almost never have a speci­
fied class of operation. Instead, they focus on factors such as power, efficiency, 
and linearity (as listed in Section 4.1). It’s up to the designer to determine the 
ideal bias condition and whether harmonic terminations are worthwhile. Even 
if one wanted to realize a perfect textbook implementation of a particular class, 
there is no way to verify it. True verification would require measuring the pre­
cise voltage and current at the transistor terminals (not the amplifier terminals), 
which is impractical due to the observer effect (the act of probing would alter the 
waveforms they were intended to measure).
Some of the best amplifiers made in practice do not follow any of the be­
fore mentioned classes. A combination of clever matching, bias, and transistor 
selection can shape waveforms in such a way to support high conduction angles 
(for improved gain, power, and linearity) and reduce current/voltage overlap 
(for improved efficiency). Unfortunately, the best design strategies are often 
kept as trade secrets so they cannot be discussed openly.
4.2  Design Strategies and Practices
Understanding how bias and terminations effect amplifier behavior allows a 
designer to choose the best approach to fit a particular performance need. Once 

 
Power Amplifier

that is established, the details must be fine-tuned to ensure all requirements are 
met. This section dives deeper into amplifier design details.
4.2.1  Stability
All active devices have the potential of becoming unstable. If this happens, 
power is generated at a frequency other than what is intended. This undesired 
frequency is called an oscillation, and the amplifier is said to be oscillating when 
this happens. Since energy must be conserved, this means less energy is generat­
ed at the frequencies of interest (i.e., fo ). Aside from a decrease in performance, 
instability can also lead to failure if driven harder or operated long enough.
There are many potential sources of oscillation. Often, stability is linked 
to certain input or output impedances. An amplifier that is stable regardless of 
the port impedances is unconditionally stable. It is almost always desirable to be 
unconditionally stable (if the port impedances are tightly controlled, it is con­
ceivable that unconditional stability may not be required).
Fortunately, there are ways during the design process to determine if a 
circuit can be unstable and to resolve the source of instability. The methods 
described in this section must be true over all frequencies, not just the intended 
operating frequency. Instability can occur well below or above band. When per­
forming a stability analysis, it is best to calculate or simulate from 0 Hz (or as 
close to it as possible) to fmax (3.24). At minimum, analysis should be performed 
to at least 2fo (3fo or more would be better). 
The quickest test is to evaluate the return loss. If S11 and S22 are not 
contained within the Smith chart, then the amplifier is unstable. That is, to be 
stable,

A more thorough analysis includes calculating the Rollett stability factor, 
or K-factor, which must be greater than one for unconditional stability . Mak­
ing this calculation starts by calculating the determinant of the S-parameters 
(denoted as Δ).

Graphically, stability circles can be plotted on a Smith chart to show im­
pedance regions of stability (or instability). Separate circles are drawn for the 
source and load. The centers of the circles (Cstability,L and Cstability,S) are calculated

From the center and radius, a compass can be used to draw the circles 
on a Smith chart. The circle drawn can either enclose the region of stability or 
instability. This is determined from  and whether the origin (Zn = 1 + j0Ω) is 
within the circle or outside the circle. Table 4.1 summarizes these conditions.
Alternatively, the same conclusion made in Table 4.1 can be determined 
mathematically. The load stability circle encloses the origin if either are true:

4.2.2  Power and Gain
The output power capability of a transistor is proportional to its periphery 
(more specifically, its gate periphery). The periphery is equal to the gate width 
multiplied by the number of gate fingers). A 4 × 200-μm transistor has a total 
periphery of 800 μm (0.8 mm). If the power density of the transistor is 3.5 W/
mm, then the maximum output power of the transistor is 3.5 W/mm × 0.8 
mm = 2.8W. If the desired transistor output power is 25W, then nine of those 
4×200-μm transistors are needed.

Radar RF Circuit Design
Output power at the amplifier level is often specified at a saturated level 
(Psat, meaning no additional power is possible regardless of increasing input 
drive) or at a particular compression level. On a spec sheet, the latter appears as 
PNdB, where N is the number of decibels compressed (i.e., gain has reduced by 
N dB from the small-signal level). P1dB is commonly used and denotes 1-dB 
gain compression. P3dB is also commonly used since it is often similar in power 
to Psat and is more precisely defined. 
Practical Note
P1dB is a common power level because it generally marks the compression point 
when linearity starts to degrade quickly. However, we know from our discussion on 
classes that some amplifiers will be inherently more linear than others. It is much more 
accurate to define “linear output power,” which is the power level required without ex­
ceeding a set linearity. For example, a specification could include an IM3 specification 
of 40 dBc (decibels relative to the carrier) with a linear output power of 10W. From a 
system point-of-view, the compression level is not important. The output power and 
linearity are what matter.
Transistor impedance is inversely proportional to periphery. The larger a 
transistor is scaled, the smaller the impedance becomes and the more difficult 
it becomes to match to (especially broadband). For high-power applications, 
using transistors with higher power density (like GaN) is advantageous because 
smaller transistors can be used.
The effects of impedance mismatch were discussed in Chapter 2 and now 
will be applied to power amplifiers. When an amplifier is attached to a signal 
source, a potential mismatch occurs. If the effects of the mismatch are ignored, 
the gain of the system is called the power gain, and it is defined by:
	
L
p
in
P
G
P
=
	
(4.32)
where Gp is the power gain (unitless), PL is the power delivered to the load 
(watts), and Pin is the amplifier input power (watts). 
If the effects of the mismatch are not ignored, the gain of the system is 
called the transducer gain and it is defined by:
	
L
t
inc
P
G
P
=
	
(4.33)
where Gt is the transducer gain (unitless), PL is the power delivered to the load

Just as with stability circles, gain circles can also be drawn. This allows

starts by calculating the maximum normalized gain [3]:

4.2.3  Efficiency
Providing good efficiency is important for a number of reasons at the system 
and component levels. The following are system-level reasons for efficiency:
• Reducing prime power consumption while maintaining desired output 
performance;
• Producing prime power with a smaller generator;
• Generating less waste heat and thereby minimizing thermal load;
• Lowering operating expense;
• Improving mobility due to smaller size and weight.
The component-level benefits of efficiency are the following.
• Longer lifetime since the component;
• The lower bias (mainly drain current) simplifies circuitry.
The most common efficiency metric is the PAE, which is calculated from:

where PL is the power at the load (W), Pin is the input power (W), Pdc is the 
DC power consumed (W), Gp is the power gain (unitless), and ηd is the drain 
efficiency (unitless).

When gain is high, PL is much larger than Pin so ηd is similar to PAE.
4.2.4  Gain Flattening
It was shown in (3.23) that the gain drops by 6 dB every time the frequency 
doubles. In some radars, this is not an issue. The radar range will be larger at 
lower frequencies. In some radars, gain flatness over the band is critical. There 
are two principal methods for flattening gain, described as follows.
• Adding a lossy filter like the pi-network shown in Figure 4.8 to the input 
of the amplifier to equalize the gain. Although the circuit can be placed 
anywhere in the RF chain, it is usually placed right before the amplifier. 
Values can be optimized to track any unique characteristics of the gain 
roll-off. There are a myriad of high-pass filters that can be used for this 
approach.
• Adding a negative feedback circuit between the gate and drain. This 
is commonly implemented with a resistor as shown in Figure 4.9. To 
prevent shorting Vg and Vd, a large capacitor is placed in series with the 
resistor. Feedback mechanisms are complicated, so in practice, the value 
of R is generally determined through optimization in a simulator.

106 
Radar RF Circuit Design
Adding negative feedback also tends to improve the input and output 
return loss and improve stability. However, it can be tricky to implement since 
the RC circuit could be physically much larger than the transistor (especially 
if in bare die form). To be effective, the RC circuit needs to be as close to the 
gate and drain as possible to minimize phase shift in the feedback loop. Since a 
resistor is added to the series path, noise figure will degrade.
4.2.5  VSWR
Chapter 2 discusses the concepts of VSWR and mismatch. For an amplifier, 
achieving good VSWR is important to ensure maximum incident power and 
maximum delivered power to the load. The reflection coefficient for the input 
and output can be calculated from:
Figure 4.8  Example of a gain-flattening circuit.

This process can be repeated for different Γx values to generate a set of 
contours. These contours can be plotted on the same Smith chart as gain and 
stability circles to see the trade space graphically.
4.2.6  Conjugate Matching
If the transistor is unconditionally stable, conjugate impedance matching can 
be used to achieve peak gain and power. This is implemented using the follow­
ing steps.

4.2.7  DC Bias Filtering
Any alternating current (AC) or RF signal that is superimposed on the DC line 
will enter the transistor drain and be amplified. In addition to unwanted (spuri­
ous) signals on the output, this can also lead to oscillation. DC lines can pick 
up AC or RF signals by:
• Noise from the power supply (even the best models have a noise speci­
fication);
• Coupling from other circuit elements;
• Receiving signals from the environment outside the amplifier.
These non-DC signal components can be removed by providing a low re­
sistance path to ground without shorting DC to ground. This is accomplished 
using a decoupling or bypass capacitor. If the component value is chosen prop­
erly, any alternating voltage passing that node should be shorted to ground. 
Since a capacitor blocks DC, the DC voltage is unaffected.
The best decoupling circuits utilize multiple capacitors in parallel rather 
than one large capacitor. (Remember, larger capacitors provide low resistance 
to lower frequencies.) This provides a balance of component response time and 
parasitic mitigation. A good rule of thumb is to use three or more parallel capac­
itors. Figure 4.10 shows an amplifier with gate and drain decoupling circuits.
Since noise can be comprised of virtually any frequency, a wideband re­
sponse is needed. Generally, small, medium, and large capacitors are chosen to 
satisfy this need. For example, the largest capacitor may be 1–10 μF (although 
it is not uncommon to go as high as 220–470 μF). The medium capacitor may 
be between 0.01 and 0.1 μF. The small capacitor is usually 100–1,000 pF.

110 
Radar RF Circuit Design
Decoupling capacitors should be added wherever there are long DC (or 
bias) transmission lines. If placed every λ/8 or so, this should provide adequate 
protection. Chapter 7 discusses decoupling circuits for pulsed applications. 
4.2.8  Multistage Amplifiers
Depending on frequency, technology, and class of operation, the gain from a 
single transistor can range from 10 to 20 dB. Generally, this is not adequate 
for most applications (40 dB and higher is more typical). Multiple FETs are 
chained together to achieve the required gain level. Figure 4.11 shows the lay­
out of a generic two-stage amplifier. 
In Figure 4.11, each stage has an independent gate and drain voltage. 
Often, each stage shares the same bias. This reduces the number of power sup­
plies needed.
The steps in designing a multistage amplifier are listed as follows:
• Calculate the periphery needed on the output (final) stage to meet the 
power requirement.
• Determine the optimal bias and port impedances of the final stage to 
meet the other performance requirements.
• Calculate the periphery needed on the input (driver) stage. If high ef­
ficiency is needed from the two-stage amplifier, the input stage should 
have a much smaller periphery to minimize the DC power consumed 
(rule of thumb: 8:1 power ratio between the final and driver stage). If

high linearity is needed, the input stage should be closer in size to the 
final stage so it is linear when the final stage starts compressing (rule of 
thumb: 4:1 or 2:1 power ratio between the final and driver stage).
• Determine the optimal bias and port impedances of the driver stage to 
meet the other performance requirements.
• Design the inner-stage matching network that transforms the imped­
ance needed at the input to the final stage to the impedance needed at 
the output of the driver stage. Be sure a series capacitor (Cm) is part of 
the matching network to provide a DC block between the input-stage 
drain and the output-stage gate voltage.
• In simulation, vary (or optimize) the inner-stage matching network to 
ensure mismatch is minimized and optimal impedances are presented.
It is not uncommon to lose several decibels in an inner-stage matching 
network. This is especially true if there is a large impedance difference between 
stages or if a broadband match is needed.
4.3  Broadband Amplifiers
The terms broadband, wideband, and wide instantaneous bandwidth are in­
terchangeable and mean different things to different industries. In commu­
nications, broadband can mean 100s of megahertz. In electronic warfare, 
broadband can mean 50:1 or 100:1 bandwidth ratios relative to the operating 
frequency. Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar bandwidths tend to fall in between 
those extremes (typically 10:1 to 20:1 or less). By comparison, the vast majority 
of today’s radars have an instantaneous bandwidth of ~10%.
For a long time, radars seemed to be banded, meaning that there were S-
band radars, X-band radars, and Ku-band radars, among others. Today, there 
is a push to design, produce, qualify, and deploy one hardware design that fits 
as many systems or applications as possible. This requires broadband amplifier 
designs, which are possible but introduce the following trade-offs:
• For maximum gain and output power, amplifiers are conjugate-matched. 
In practice, this can only be realized narrowband so some performance 
will be sacrificed broadband.
• Broadband circuits will inherently have worse return loss over narrow­
band (explained by the Bode-Fano limit in Chapter 6).
• Rather than utilizing reactive matching, which is frequency-dependent, 
resistive matching is used. This reduces gain and increases NF.

 
Power Amplifier 
113
• The natural amplifier gain slope is -6 dB/octave, so more octaves cov­
ered means that it is necessary to compensate for more gain slope.
There are four popular methods for achieving broadband performance: 
multisection matching networks, balanced amplifiers, push-pull amplifiers, and 
distributed amplifiers. Section 4.3.1–4.3.4 discuss each of these.
4.3.1  Multisection Matching
Any two impedances can be matched with two elements at a single frequency. 
Since inductors, capacitors, and transmission lines are frequency-dependent, 
the impedance they present are not maintained as bandwidth increases. Resis­
tors can be used as broadband matching elements since they are not frequency-
dependent (parasitic effects aside), but they are lossy.
Matching networks are broadband if they have low quality factors, which 
means that the impedance transformation remains close to the real line of the 
Smith chart (R+j0Ω). In order to match two distant impedance, multiple ele­
ments are needed. To achieve the broadest bandwidth, elements should be cho­
sen so the transformation hops along the real line. Figure 4.12 shows two 5Ω to 
50Ω transformations centered at 10 GHz.
The impedance transformation can be made with a series 0.24-nH induc­
tor and a shunt 0.95-pF capacitor. On the Smith chart, the lighter line shows 
the impedance trace, which is quite a distance from the real line. Alternatively, 
by using a sequence of series inductors and shunt capacitors and a transmis­
sion line, the same impedance match can be made. On the Smith chart, the 
darker line shows the impedance trace, which is much closer to the real line. 
Figure 4.13 shows the frequency response. The two-element matching circuit 
(dotted line) has a 10-dB return loss bandwidth of 2.4 GHz (24% bandwidth). 
Figure 4.12  Two-element and seven-element matching circuit transformations from 5Ω to 
50Ω to achieve broadband performance (centered at 10 GHz).

114 
Radar RF Circuit Design
The seven-element matching circuit (solid line) has a bandwidth of 11.7 GHz 
(117% bandwidth), which is nearly five times the two-element bandwidth.
The previous example used a combination of lumped and distributed ele­
ments. The same could be accomplished with one or the other. At low frequen­
cy, lumped elements tend to be favored since parasitics are low and distribute 
elements are large. At high frequency, distributed elements are favored for the 
opposite reasons. For this example at X-band, either is applicable.
One additional benefit of broadband distributed matching circuits is their 
reproducibility in production. During fabrication, manufacturers can tightly 
control the line widths to achieve the designed line impedance. The unit-to-
unit variation can be much better with distributed elements. Lumped element 
providers bin parts by value and can also tightly control the nominal value, but 
parasitics can vary considerably (discussed in Chapter 7). Figure 4.14 shows 5Ω 
to 50Ω distributed transformations centered at 10 GHz.
For the one-element case, the transmission line impedance is 5 50
⋅
 = 
15.8Ω. For the two- and three-element cases, the impedance is chosen so that 
the impedance path remains as close to the real line as possible. Figure 4.15 
shows the bandwidths for a one-, two-, three-, and four-element distributed 
matching network.
4.3.2  Balanced Amplifier
Balanced amplifiers are comprised of two identical amplifiers combined in par­
allel using two hybrid (90°) couplers (discussed in Chapter 6). Figure 4.16 
shows a circuit schematic.
Balanced amplifiers can be used to ensure excellent return loss regardless 
of the reflection coefficient of the individual amplifiers. Figure 4.17 illustrates 
this concept. The incoming signal voltage is split equally (V/2) between the two 
amplifiers with 90° phase difference due to the couplers. The amplifiers will 
have reflected signals proportional to their reflection coefficients Γ1 and Γ2. 
The reflections to the input port will have 180° phase difference and cancel if 
Figure 4.13  S11 and S21 of the circuits shown in Figure 4.12.

 
Power Amplifier 
115
Γ1 = Γ2. Most of the reflected power is directed into the resistor at the isolation 
port, and only the portion resulting from the difference between Γ1 and Γ2 will 
appear at the input. The isolation resistor must be chosen carefully to ensure 
that it can handle the power level presented. Although in theory this principal 
works with any mismatch, to be effective in practice the return loss of each 
amplifier should be better than 5 dB. 
Using this approach, designers can focus on optimizing the port imped­
ances for power, efficiency, or linearity instead of impedance match. Since 
broadband impedances can be challenging to match, this approach mitigates 
that challenge.
The drawback to this approach is that it requires two amplifiers, two cou­
plers, and two load resistors, so size and cost are higher. Broadband couplers are 
typically achieved using multiple stages, which increases size. The drawbacks 
are generally outweighed by advantages, so this is a popular design strategy.
4.3.3  Push-Pull Amplifier
Push-pull amplifiers are similar in appearance to balanced amplifiers, but they 
operate quite differently. Both circuits require two amplifiers, but in a push-pull 
circuit, they are combined using a balun (a structure that transforms a single 
port referenced to a common ground to a dual port referenced to each other—
see Chapter 6). Figure 4.18 shows a push-pull amplifier.
Each amplifier receives half of the input signal, but separated by 180°. 
Baluns naturally have a lower port impedance on the splitting/combining side 
(12.5Ω or 25Ω generally), which means that the individual amplifiers only 
need to match to that lower impedance. This facilitates broadband matching, 
especially for very high-power amplifiers where impedance is low. Baluns also

50Ω.

116

have the advantage of canceling second-harmonics. Chapter 6 explains this 
principle.
Unlike balanced amplifiers, baluns do not cancel reflected signals so indi­
vidual amplifiers do need to be well matched. Isolation between amplifiers may

works.

only be 6 dB with a balun, so a careful stability analysis must be performed. 
Some baluns utilize ferrites to achieve broad bandwidth, which can increase 
size and cost. As with the balanced amplifier, the drawbacks are generally out­
weighed by advantages so this is a popular design strategy.

4.3.4  Distributed Amplifiers 
A distributed amplifier, illustrated in Figure 4.19, is a type of traveling-wave 
amplifier capable of achieving incredible bandwidths (much more so than the 
previous approaches discussed).
Multiple transistors are combined in parallel, although there is a cascad­
ing nature to the way the signals are combined. Transmission lines are placed 
between amplifiers to ensure in-phase combining. Load resistors (Zd and Zg) are 
added to absorb reflections.
Distributed amplifiers provide moderate match, gain, and noise figure. 
It’s difficult to achieve very high power or efficiency, which can prohibit them 
from some applications.
4.4  Balancing Linearity and Efficiency
In the discussion on amplifier classes in Section 4.1, it was shown that ampli­
fiers trade off efficiency for linearity. Class A provides excellent linearity and 
poor efficiency. Every class after that degrades in linearity but improves effi­
ciency. Most applications require a balance between the two extremes. Class 
AB is one way of balancing linearity and efficiency. This section will discussion 
other options. 
4.4.1  Explanation of Linearity
A circuit is no longer linear when increasing the input power by N dB does not 
also increase the output by N dB. That output energy must go somewhere, and 
some of it is generated as mixing products. This section will explain where these 
mixing products come from.
The voltage transfer function of an amplifier can be represented by the 
following Taylor series:

The a2 term generates 2f1, f1 – f1, f1 + f2, and 2f2 mixing products. Per­
forming a similar analysis on the third term would generate mixing products at 
3 f1, 3f2, 2f1 + f2, f1 + 2f2, 2f1 – f2, and –f1 + 2f2.
Higher-order mixing products occur at frequencies, mf1 +nf2 where m 
and n may be positive or negative numbers. The order of the mixing product is 
defined as |m| + |n|. Figure 4.20 shows all of the mixing products for two tones, 
f1 and f2.
Practical Note
Another term for a mixing product is a “spurious signal.” This is not to be confused 
with the term “harmonic,” which is an integral multiple of a fundamental frequency 
(i.e., 2f1, 2f2, 3f1, and 3f2).
Practical Note
Although neighboring tones are shown in the Figure 4.20 as having equal amplitude, 
this is not necessarily the case (so 2f1 – f2 doesn’t have to equal –f1 + 2f2). For this 
reasons, mixing products are usually specified as “high-side” (–f1 + 2f2) or “low-side” 
(2f1 – f2).
Table 4.2 shows an example two-tone scenario at X-band with 1-MHz 
tone spacing. In a narrowband situation, all mixing products can be filtered 
except for the third-order tones at 2f1 – f2 and 2f2 – f1. They are extremely close 
in frequency to the two fundamental tones. For this reason, linearization efforts 
generally focus on IM3.

 
Power Amplifier 
121
The levels shown in Figure 4.20 are typically seen when a nonlinear device 
(such as an amplifier) is several decibels into compression. At small-signal, when 
the device is linear, mixing products are not present and only the fundamental 
tones (f1 and f2 in this case) are present. As the input power level increases, 
the fundamental tones increase linearly (1-dB output: 1-dB input). However, 
second-order products increase by 2 dB for every 1 dB additional input power. 
Third-order products increase by 3 dB for every 1 dB additional input power 
(and so on). Mixing product levels are negligible at small-signal and will appear 
once the fundamental tones stop behaving linearly. If input power is increased 
high enough, mixing-product amplitude will meet or exceed the fundamental 
level. This is shown in Figure 4.21.
The circuit has a linear region with a 1-dB/dB slope. At some power level, 
the circuit will saturate (Psat), and additional input power will generate no ad­
ditional output power. The second-order mixing products (IM2) are summed 
and plotted with a 2-dB/dB slope. Intermodulation products are calculated by 
Figure 4.20  Mixing products for two input tones, f1 and f2.

where Px is the power level at tone x. Units are in decibels with respect to carrier.
The IM2 line intersects a line extrapolating the power of the fundamental 
tone at a point called the second-order intercept point (IP2). That point corre­
sponds to an input power IIP2 and an output power OIP2. The same process 
is done for the third-order products (IM3) and their related third-order intercept 
point (IP3). 
Although intercept points cannot be measured, they are sometimes used 
as a way of specifying linearity. Often, OIP3 is ~10 dB above Psat so that can be 
used as a rule of thumb.
Practical Note
In reality, mixing products compress and saturate just like the fundamental frequency. 
This can add ambiguity when specifying an intercept point since it is a calculated 
number. Since IMX are measured values, they are a safer way to specify linearity.

Power Amplifier

4.4.2  Doherty
Doherty circuits are advantageous when the average power is much less than 
the peak power (by 6–12 dB). When an amplifier operates backed off from 
saturation, the output is linear, but efficiency is low (efficiency usually peaks 
~3–5 dB in compression). Doherty combines two amplifiers operating with 
different classes to achieve high efficiency at back-off and at saturation. Figure 
4.22 shows the Doherty circuit.
The carrier amplifier is usually biased Class AB so it strikes a balance of 
linearity and efficiency. The peaking amplifier is biased Class C, so it is essen­
tially OFF at back-off. The operation is shown in Figure 4.23.
The two amplifiers are separated by 90°, which can be implemented by 
a simple transmission line or a hybrid coupler (as shown in Figure 4.22). The 
advantage of a coupler is the cancelation of reflected signals at the input. At 
back-off, only the carrier amplifier is operational so its individual performance 
defines the Doherty output. The peaking amplifier is designed so it turns on 
at the same power level where the carrier amplifier starts to compress. This 
extends the linear operating region of the amplifier, so it is linear over a wide 
dynamic range. Concurrently, both the carrier and peaking amplifiers are run­
ning efficiently so the Doherty amplifier is efficient over the same dynamic 
range (the carrier defines the efficiency below saturation and the peaking de­
fines the efficiency in saturation). On the output of the amplifiers, a quarter-
wave transformer combines the signals in-phase. Since the effective impedance 
at that combination point is Zo/ 2, another quarter-wave transformer is used to 
achieve Zo. 
This circuit approach has been widely used throughout the communica­
tions industry for decades. Many variations on this circuit have been made over 
the years to improve on performance, including the following:
• Unequal input power division between carrier and peaking;
• Incorporating baluns to cancel second harmonics;
• Using amplifiers with different output power;
• Combining more than two amplifiers.

Radar RF Circuit Design
4.4.3  Other Linearization Techniques
The design approaches discussed to this point represent the industry standard, 
but there are some lesser known but equally beneficial options. These include 
the following:
1.	 Transistor selection: Transistors are made in foundries all over the 
world, and often they are chosen for convenience, price, availability, 
familiarity, and periphery, among other advantages. Linearity should 
also be a screening criteria during transistor selection. Device archi­
tecture and chemistry can inherently improve linearity by as much as 
20 dB. A strong correlation has been found between doping profile 
and linearity, so some foundries have released specialized high-linearity 
processes. Recently, an emerging technology has made high-linearity 
GaN transistors commercially available.
Practical Note
When reviewing data sheets of transistors, be wary of “specmanship.” Some transistor 
data sheets show linearity 10-dB backed-off from saturation. The linearity looks ter­
rific, but they are operating in the linear region. Look for linearity plots versus output 
power instead of input power.
2.	 Source and load matching: Before designing, generate source and load-
pull contours for linearity (i.e., IM3, IM2, and ACPR). This can be 
done in measurement or simulation. On one Smith chart, contours 
for power, efficiency, and linearity (not to mention noise, VSWR, and 
other parameters) can be plotted to directly compare the trade space.
Figure 4.23  Output power versus input power for the carrier and peaking amplifiers within a 
Doherty amplifier (not drawn to scale to show alignment of power levels).

 
Power Amplifier

3.	 Analog predistortion (APD): Predistortion is the process of modifying a 
signal before it enters the amplifier to correct for the expected nonlin­
earity. APD implements the modification using RF circuit elements, 
rather than digital processors. Figure 4.24 shows the predistortion 
process.
	
  An amplifier has a set output power versus input power compres­
sion curve. A predistortion element is placed before the amplifier that 
has the complementary response. When the amplifier is linear, the 
linearizer has a fixed loss. When the amplifier starts to compress, the 
linearizer loss decreases at the same rate. Once the amplifier is satu­
rated, the linearizer loss should ideally be zero. Effectively, this extends 
the linear region to a wider dynamic range. However, it does not in­
crease the saturated output power level as is commonly shown in open 
literature. The watts per millimeter generated by an amplifier cannot 
increase due to the addition of a lossy element; therefore saturated 
output power cannot increase.
	
  Analog predistorters are simple to integrate and can easily improve 
linearity by 10–20 dB (meaning that mixing-product amplitudes are 
10–20 dB lower with a predistortion circuit added). The trade-off is 
added loss at back-off, which reduces gain and increases noise figure. 
They can be challenging to implement broadband since compression 
curve shape can change over frequency. If the linearizer loss and com­
pression curves are not aligned, linearity can degrade instead of im­
prove.
	
  In production, APD can be challenging if there is a large variation 
from amplifier to amplifier. One way of mitigating this is by binning 
amplifiers and linearizers and matching curves.
4.	 Digital predistortion (DPD): DPD is similar to APD, except that the 
desired input to the amplifier is implemented by a synthesizer generat­
Figure 4.24  Predistortion process for a nonlinear amplifier.

126 
Radar RF Circuit Design
ing the signal. Algorithms can be used to tune the waveform for each 
amplifier, which can improve linearity by 50–80 dB (same definition 
as before). Tuning in real time also makes DPD more effective across 
operating condition, broad bandwidth, and production variation.
	
  Since radars have digital circuitry for performing complex math­
ematics, DPD is a more logical choice for linearization. This topic is 
explored further in Chapter 8.
4.5  Multiphysics Concerns
Cramming incredible amounts of power into a small area does you no good if 
the unit overheats and fails. Achieving never-before-seen efficiency is wasted if 
the material properties change when exposed to moisture. The best linearizer 
is deemed ineffective if the amplifier dies after 1,000 hours from a buildup of 
microcracks.
Today’s radars are smaller, lighter, and higher-power, and they operate in 
the most extreme conditions ever. Designing for optimal electrical performance 
without considering mechanical concerns is a fool’s errand and is a topic often 
overlooked in RF design books. This section discusses the mechanical concerns 
every radar component designer needs to know.
4.5.1  Thermal Considerations
Just as RF designers simulate circuits to evaluate the effects of loss, parasitics, 
and other imperfections, there is no substitute for a full thermal analysis. Mul­
timaterial stack-ups spread heat in complicated ways. Tolerances in materials 
can be wide. Interfaces are never perfect. The effects of thermal conduction, 
convection, and radiation must be evaluated. In any system, there are multiple 
sources and sinks of thermal energy. The only way to truly capture this is in 
high-fidelity simulation and testing.
The thermal energy dissipated from an amplifier is defined by [1]:

tance (°C/W), θCS is the case-to-heat sink thermal resistance (°C/W), and θSA 
is the heat sink-to-ambient thermal resistance (°C/W). 
NOTE: Tj may also be called Tjc or Tc, which indicates that the device has 
a channel rather than a junction.

127
Practical Note
A good rule of thumb is that output power drops by 0.016 dB/°C per stage. So, an 
amplifier loses 0.5 dB for every ~30°C rise in temperature per stage.
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion
Most materials expand with increasing temperature and contract with decreas­
ing temperature. The magnitude of that change, which is determined by a ma­
terial’s coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), is represented by the following 
equation:

sion and negative for contraction.

where dT is the change in length (m), and L is the original length (m).
Heat Capacity
Some objects, like a cast iron skillet, heat up very quickly when placed on a 
heat source. This is because they have a very low heat capacity, meaning that 
the application of very little heat results in a large temperature increase. This is 
represented mathematically as:
	
Q
C
T
= Δ
	
(4.76)
where C is the heat capacity (calories per degree Celsius or joules per degree 
Celsius), Q is the heat applied (calories or joules), and ΔT is the change in 
temperature.
Heat capacity is proportional to mass (a larger skillet will have a smaller 
temperature rise than a small skillet for a fixed heat applied), which that means 
every object has its own value. This can make comparing multiple materials dif­
ficult. To avoid this, heat capacity is generally normalized to mass to make it a 
material-specific property, and this is known as the specific heat.

(4.79)
where L is the thickness (m) and A is the area of the object (m2).
Absolute thermal resistance is object-specific, and units are Kelvin per 
Watt (K/W). The generic thermal resistance of a material is calculated the 
same without dividing by the area. Units are meters squared Kelvin per Watt 
(m2·K/W) or sometimes they are quoted in data sheets as feet squared Celsius 
hours per British thermal unit (ft2·°C·hr/Btu).
Practical Note
An often underestimated source of thermal resistance is due to imperfect contact 
between conducting surfaces. Even though the physical size may be small, surface 
roughness or contamination can have a significant effect. For example, the addition 
of a thin soft-metal foil (i.e., indium, lead, tin, or silver) or thermally conductive (i.e., 
silicon-based) paste between two surfaces can improve thermal conduction by four to 
10 times.
Generally for microwave applications (especially power amplifiers), what 
matters most is the rise (or fall) in temperature as a result of a heat (or cooling) 
source. This can be calculated from:

Watts per meter squared Kelvin (W/m2·K), Ts is the surface temperature, and 
Tf is the fluid temperature. Table 4.3 lists typical ranges of h.
The large range of h shown in Table 4.3 is due to the complexity of mov­
ing fluids. Consider, for example, the following [4]: 
• Objects “in the way” cause uneven flow.
• Fluids compress so there are areas of higher/lower pressure.
• Fluids experience inertia, which must be accounted for.
• Even on a smooth surface, friction slows the flow over the surface (that 
is, it has drag).
• Excessive disruptions in fluid flow causes turbulence.

Thermal Radiation
All objects above absolute zero (0K) radiate heat. Although the effects of ther­
mal radiation are generally negligible for microwave components, they are in­
cluded here for completeness. The power radiated due to its heat can be calcu­
lated by [5]:

where σSB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.6703 × 10–8 W/m2·K4), εrad 
is the emissivity (material property between 0 and 1), A is the surface area 
(square meters), Ts is the object surface temperature (K), and Tsurroundings is the 
temperature of the surrounding volume (K). In other text books, the subscripts 
“SB” and “rad” are not used, but since σ and ε have meaning in the microwave 
domain, they are included here for clarity.
Emissivity is a radiative property of the surface to quantify how efficient 
a surface radiates energy. The thermal resistance due to radiation (Rth,rad) is

The effects of radiation are minimal. Figure 4.25 shows the radiated heat 
from a 6 mm × 6 mm GaN-on-SiC MMIC with the surrounding tempera­
ture set to ambient (25°C) as the surface temperature (Ts ) is swept from 0K 
(–273.15°C) to 400K (126.85°C). 
The dissipated heat is less than 32 mW. Given that a GaN MMIC that 
size is easily capable of generating more than 100W, this radiated power level is 
negligible (0.032%).

In all cases, heat transfer can be maximized by increasing the contact area, 
but this conflicts with the objective of making circuits as small as possible. 
Choosing carrier materials to minimize the thermal resistance (Rth,cond) can im­
prove heat transfer through conduction. Using forced air or liquid cooling can 
increase the convection heat transfer coefficient (h), although this is usually 
limited by the system. 
Alternatively, fins can be added to aid in convection, and the efficiency is 
a measure of its effectiveness. The efficiency of a straight, rectangular fin can be 
calculated from [5]:

Figure 4.26 shows a plot comparing the efficiency of 1-cm-long alumi­
num fins with forced-air cooling. If either is more than a few millimeters thick, 
the difference is almost negligible. In both cases, forced air cooling with a fin is 
very effective at removing heat.
Thermal Spreaders
Sometimes designers do not have the luxury of a heat sink in close proximity 
to a heat source. In these cases, it’s important to spread the heat as much as 
possible to reduce peak temperature. Fortunately, there are a number of com­
mercial and military-grade materials that can be used for this. Some examples 
are listed as follows:
• Thermally conductive pastes, gels, and greases;
• Silicone and nonsilicone thermal sheets to serve as interface layers;
• Heat pipes;
• High thermal-conductivity ceramics;
• High thermal-conductivity semiconductor (i.e., aluminum nitride);

• Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond.
Generally these approaches are implemented at the module level, so they 
are discussed in Chapter 8. 
4.5.2  Mechanical Considerations
The real world is not static. Most if not all commercial and military radars go 
through some degree of “shake, rattle, and roll” testing. This is to verify that 
the design can handle the effects of the operating environment. These condi­
tions must be considered in the microwave design. There is no substitute for 
a complete mechanical analysis, but this section will review the key terms and 
equations you need to know [6]. Again, high-fidelity simulations can greatly aid 
designers and reduce the overall time needed to complete a successful design.
Practical Note
In an informal survey conducted at the 2014 International Microwave Symposium, 
a significant percentage of microwave designers admitted to spending as much time 
accounting for thermal and mechanical requirements as electrical.
Stress
Stress is the intensity of a force applied to an object. The magnitude of the stress 
is defined as:
	
P
A
σ =
	
(4.94)
where σ is the stress [pounds per square inch (psi), Newtons per square meter 
(N/m2), or Pascals (Pa)], P is the force or pressure (pounds or Newtons), and A 
is the area over which the force is applied (in2 or m2).
If the force is in a direction that stretches the object, it is called tensile stress 
and the sign on σ is positive. If the direction compression the object, it is called 
compressive stress and the sign on σ is negative. 
Strain
Some objects are brittle in nature and do not deform under stress. Many ceram­
ics, for example, hold their shape until enough stress is applied to cause crack­
ing. Other materials, like metals, are ductile in nature. Their shape will deform 
under stress. When an object elongates under tensile stress or shortens under 
compressive stress, this change in length is call strain. It is defined as [4]:

 
Power Amplifier 
135
	
L
δ
ε =
	
(4.95)
where ε is the strain (unitless), Δ is the change in length (m), and L is the origi­
nal length (m). Often, strain is simply expressed as a percentage.
If the object is stretched, it is called tensile strain and the sign on ε is posi­
tive. If the object is shortened, it is called compressive strain and the sign on ε is 
negative.
Most materials do not change in just one direction when stretched or 
compressed. If you stretch a bar of metal, for example, the length will elongate, 
but the width will also decrease (you get a longer, thinner wire). That ratio of 
length elongation to width narrowing is known as Poisson’s ratio:
	
lateral
axial
ε
υ
ε
= -
	
(4.96)
where ν is Poisson’s ratio (unitless), εlateral is the strain in the direction normal 
to the applied stress (unitless), and εaxial is the strain in the direction parallel to 
the applied stress (unitless).
Generally, either εlateral or εaxial is negative, but not both (that would im­
ply growth in all directions when stretched, for example). Therefore, to make 
Poisson’s ratio positive, the convention is to add a negative sign to the equation. 
A material can also be expressed by its modulus of elasticity (or Young’s 
modulus) defined by:
	
E
σ
ε
=
	
(4.97)
Since strain is unitless, E is expressed as the same units as stress. This equa­
tion is commonly known as Hooke’s law. Using this value, we can calculate the 
stress caused by a change in temperature by:
	
E
T
σ
α
=
Δ
	
(4.98)
where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion (1/°C).
Fatigue
Over its lifetime, a radar component is exposed to a highly dynamic environ­
ment. Radar systems may be transported and deployed many times. Desert 
deployment can mean very hot days and very cool nights. Radars will cycle 

136 
Radar RF Circuit Design
between moments of activity and rest. Even during constant operation, condi­
tions within the radar may change (i.e., adaptive output power) to meet per­
formance needs. The effect of these individual stresses may be small (almost 
negligible), but when factored over the lifetime of the system (10–30 years, 
or longer) they can be significant. The wearing down or deterioration of com­
ponents due to repetitious stress is called fatigue. It’s not uncommon for radar 
components to experience millions or billions of repeated stress cycles over their 
lifetime. Fatigue can occur in metal, polymers, and ceramics, although ceramics 
are the least susceptible to fatigue [7].
Practical Note
Taking a paper clip and bending it back and forth until it weakens and eventually 
breaks is an example of failure due to fatigue.
Failure due to fatigue happens when the stress is so high that the mechani­
cal structure loses integrity and a microcrack is formed. This reduces the area 
over which the stress is distributed, which concentrates (increases) the stress. If 
the stress condition continues, the microcrack will spread until the area intact is 
no longer sufficient to bear the stress. Generally with microwave components, 
materials are small and thin so once a microcrack is formed, catastrophic failure 
happens quickly.
Figure 4.27 shows a representative endurance curve (or S-N curve). It indi­
cates two important relationships between stress and endurance:
• There is an upper level of stress under which the object cannot endure 
even one cycle;
• There is a lower level of stress under which the object could (theoretical­
ly) endure an infinite number of cycles (called the endurance limit) [7].
Figure 4.27  Example endurance curve.

 
Power Amplifier 
137
Practical Note
Not all materials have a clearly defined endurance limit as shown in Figure 4.27. Some 
materials exhibit S-N curves that continue to decrease instead of flatten. In these 
cases, it is generally accepted to set the endurance limit at the stress level correspond­
ing to 107 cycles.
The properties of fatigue are difficult to quantify because they vary with 
the following factors [6]:
• Properties of the material(s) involved;
• Geometry of the components;
• Speed of stress changes;
• Magnitude of stress.
As a rule of thumb, the endurance limit is generally between 25 and 50% 
of the ultimate tensile strength (σuts) of the material (a value provided by the 
material manufacturer).
Since fatigue always starts at the surface, components can be designed 
for greater endurance by optimizing the surface condition. Materials that are 
naturally rough (i.e., machined metal parts) are naturally prone to instigate mi­
crocracks. Polishing the surface can reduce the tendency to crack. Adding a sur­
face treatment to prevent oxidation or corrosion can help resist fatigue. Tool or 
grinding marks should run parallel to the primary loading direction, if possible.
4.6  Local Oscillators (LOs)
Much of this chapter deals with how to prevent unstable or oscillating ampli­
fiers. Otherwise, signals will be generated other than what is desired. However, 
there is a need for LOs, active components that intentionally oscillate to gener­
ate an RF signal. LOs are rated based on how constant the frequency remains 
over time and temperature (called stability), level of phase noise (fluctuations 
in the phase of a waveform), and linearity (no tones generated other than the 
intended one).
There are several types of LOs, including the following:
• Crystal oscillators: Components that use the mechanical resonance of a 
vibrating crystal (usually quartz) to create a very precise frequency. These 
are popular due to their good stability and low cost. However, crystal 
oscillators can only operate at one frequency.

138 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs): Tunable components that are 
capable of changing the oscillating frequency using tunable analog ele­
ments, such as varactors. At high frequency, tunable analog elements can 
have excessive parasitic effects that can limit performance.
• Direct digital synthesizers (DDS): Tunable components that are capable 
of changing the oscillating frequency using digital circuits. These com­
ponents have the disadvantage of being relatively noisy and offer less 
tunability than analog circuits. However, a single integrated circuit can 
provide DSS, so size and cost are minimal.
To improve stability in tunable circuits, phase-locked loops (PLLs) can be 
incorporated. A PLL is a feedback mechanism that compares the input phase 
(and frequency) to the output phase (and frequency). It is possible to compen­
sate for any detected discrepancy to maintain stable performance [8].
Practical Note
Phase noise and jitter are essentially the same thing. The former term is generally used 
in the RF domain, and the latter is used in the digital domain.
Chapter 6 shows how an LO can be combined with a mixer to perform 
up- and down-frequency conversion. LO design is outside the scope of this 
book, but interested readers are encouraged to review [9].
4.7  Tubes, Solid-State, and Where They Overlap
Over the past decade, solid-state sources have become the preferred method of 
generating RF power in radar transmitters, both in new designs and in retrofit­
ting legacy radars. A large fraction of radars operating today still rely on tubes 
for the final power stages. However, tubes suffer from wear and tear issues, and 
they are being replaced with solid-state power amplifiers whenever possible. In 
the class of electronically scanned array antennas, solid-state transmit/receive 
modules now power the largest and most powerful ground-based radars (e.g., 
BMEWS and PAVE PAWS systems) and virtually all the latest multipurpose 
radars for fighter and attack aircraft.
The introduction of GaN and its 5–15 W/mm power density marked 
the first time solid-state amplifiers could go head-to-head with tubes. GaN-on-
diamond, GaN-on-graphene, and other technologies are on the horizon and 
offer the potential of three to five times those levels (hence why nearly half of 
the power amplifier chapter was dedicated to thermal and mechanical consider­
ations). Through advancements in radar technology, AESAs achieve high pow­
ers by combining many solid-state amplifiers (sometimes in the thousands). 

 
Power Amplifier 
139
The need for megawatt power for a single amplifier is not needed. There could 
come a day when solid-state capabilities equal or overcome tubes.
Nevertheless, tube manufacturers are not resting on their laurels. Tubes 
are getting smaller, more reliable, and more affordable. They still require elec­
tron generation, which typically includes a warm-up delay. Power supply volt­
ages still range above 600V, which can be an issue—but these voltages are de­
creasing. Reliability is still measured in years instead of hundreds of years (like 
solid-state), but this is also improving.
Some of the best circuits utilize solid-state amplifiers to drive tubes. Al­
though the focus of this book is on solid-state, at least for the foreseeable future, 
tubes will continue to have a place in radar systems.

LNAs
If the power amplifier is the cornerstone of the transmit radar, the LNA is the 
equivalent for the receive radar. Before reviewing LNA design strategies, it is 
important to understand what noise is and where it comes from. Noise is an 
electrical signal with random behavior. All electronic circuits inherently gener­
ate noise. Noise can be measured, and even though the amplitude is random, 
the average magnitude can be predicted by probability. Figure 5.1 shows what a 
real sine wave might look like with and without noise.
Sources of noise in a radar can be external to a system (i.e., received from 
sky noise, some of which—amazingly—is a remnant of the Big Bang!) or in­
ternal (i.e., created by the components within the system). Noise from one 
component can couple to another component. This is known as interference or 
crosstalk (discussed in Chapter 8).
This chapter introduces the types of noise present in radar systems and 
demonstrates how to calculate component performance with noise. In addition, 
it discusses the process for designing an LNA, including information on self-bi­
asing, equalization, designing for high dynamic range, and cryogenic operation.
5.1  Explanation of Noise
There are several sources of noise related to radar components, including the 
following [1]:
• Thermal (also known as Johnson or Nyquist) noise: Generated by ther­
mal energy from all resistive elements as free electrons move randomly at 
temperatures above absolute zero (0K).

142 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Shot noise (also known as Poisson noise): The result of random fluctua­
tions of charge carriers across a transistor p-n junction, which is directly 
proportional to DC bias current.
• Flicker, 1/f (read “one over f”), contact, excess, or pink noise: Triggered 
when imperfect contact between two conducting materials causes con­
ductivity to fluctuate when DC current is applied.
• Quantum noise: Caused by charge carriers and photons. The magni­
tude is generally negligible compared to the other noise sources in most 
devices.
The Fourier transform (5.1) is an integral equation that converts a signal 
in the time domain (like the one shown in Figure 5.1) into the frequency do­
main. It is given by:

(5.1)
where G(f) is the frequency-domain response, g(t) is the time-domain response, 
j is the imaginary number 
1
- , f is the frequency of interest, and t is time. 
The frequency-domain response is determined by calculating (5.1) at every fre­
quency point. The function of a spectrum analyzer is to perform this process 
fast enough to be displayed in real time. 
Taking the Fourier transform of a signal determines the magnitude of the 
desired and undesired (including noise) frequencies. The frequency response 
after taking the Fourier transform of a single-tone signal is shown in Figure 5.2.

Figure 5.2 shows noise occurring at nearly every frequency. Integrating 
the noise level across all frequencies would give an infinite response. Therefore, 
the only way to quantify noise is to specify a bandwidth of interest. The amount 
of noise occurring in a given bandwidth is known as the noise power spectral 
density, or more commonly, noise power density (NPD). The units of NPD are 
typically watts per hertz (W/Hz) or watt-seconds (W-s), and the symbol is N0. 
The wider the bandwidth, the more noise that will fall within that bandwidth.
5.1.1  Thermal Noise
The history of thermal noise (and noise in general) is presented in great detail 
by Leon Cohen in [2]. Thermal noise has a uniform or flat power distribution 
across frequencies giving it the distinction of being called white noise (an analog 
to white light, which encompasses all optical frequencies). 
Thermal noise is the dominant source of noise in most radar systems op­
erating above high-frequency (HF), where sky noise can actually be dominant. 
Thermal noise voltage can be calculated using Planck’s black body radiation law 
(rms value):

(1.381 × 10–23 J/K), T is temperature (K), B is system bandwidth (Hz), f is the 
center frequency (Hz), and R is the noise resistance (W).

The ratio of h/k is approximately 4.74 × 10–11. Since RF radar has frequen­
cies on the order of GHz (109), the first term in the Taylor series is significant. 
In higher-order terms, that ratio trumps the frequency so as an approximation, 
they can be ignored. The exponent of (5.2) then simplifies to:

This is known as the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. Notice that thermal 
noise voltage is independent of frequency as stated earlier, and it applies to the 
open-circuit voltage of resistance R at temperature T. Figure 5.3 shows the noise 
voltage for three bandwidths at 290K versus resistance.
Noise sources that may or may not be derived from temperature but that 
are not a function of frequency can be considered white noise and handled as 
such. When this is the case, noise temperature is referred to as the equivalent 
noise temperature, Te [1], to differentiate from a pure thermal noise source.
From the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, it was shown that noise is pro­
portional to bandwidth and temperature; reducing one or both will reduce the 
noise level.
Noise power can be calculated from [3]:

Practical Note
Although it’s been stated that white noise occupies all frequencies, it actually has a cut­
off frequency in the infrared range (300 GHz–430 THz). For all intents and purposes 
for radar, assume that white noise occupies all frequencies.
5.1.2  Shot Noise
Shot noise occurs in transistor devices with a junction (as opposed to a conduct­
ing channel, discussed in Chapter 3). This includes p-n junction diodes, bipolar 
transistors, and MOSFETs. It is caused by random diffusion of holes and elec­
trons through a p-n junction and by the random generation and recombination 
of hole-electron pairs [4]. When this happens, random fluctuations of current 
occur. Shot noise current can be calculated by the Schottky formula [5]:

where q is the charge of an electron (1.6 × 10–19 C), IDC is the average DC cur­
rent (amperes), and B is the noise bandwidth (hertz). 
Since shot noise is independent of frequency, it is also classified as white 
noise. For practical purposes, unless current or bandwidth are extremely high, 
shot noise tends to be negligible. For example, the shot noise generated from 
1-A and 1-GHz bandwidth, is only 17.9 μA (0.00179% of the 1-A source).
5.1.3  Flicker Noise
When DC current flows through two conductive materials, imperfections at 
the interface can generate noise current. This is called flicker noise, and it can be 
calculated by [4]:
	
m

(5.10)
where Kf  is the flicker noise coefficient (A), I is the DC current (A), m is the 
flicker noise exponent (usually 1 < m < 3), B is the noise bandwidth (Hz), f is 
the frequency (Hz), and n is the frequency exponent (usually n ≈ 1). Kf can be 
calculated by [4]:

(5.11)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant (1.381 × 10–23 J/K), T is temperature (K), ff 
is the flicker noise corner frequency (Hz), IDSS is the saturated current level 
where Vg = 0 (discussed in Section 3.3.2), Vpo is the pinch-off voltage (V), and 
Id is the drain current (A). The flicker noise corner frequency is defined as the 
frequency where the noise spectral density is 3 dB higher than the voltage at 
high frequency.
Notice that flicker noise is only generated when DC current flows. Since 
the noise level varies inversely proportional with frequency, it is called 1/f (read 
“one over f”) noise. Since the noise level is higher at low frequency, it is also 
called pink noise because pink light has a power density that increases at lower 
frequency.
Practical Note
Above 100 MHz or so, flicker noise is insignificant compared to thermal and shot 
noise. For radar applications, it is easy to ignore this effect. However, low-frequency 
oscillations or mixing products (discussed in Chapter 8) can fall below 100 MHz and 
generate flicker noise.

is zero. That is [6]:

Most commonly, noise is referenced to the square root of the mean-square 
noise, which is called the root-mean-square or RMS noise (denoted vn,rms).
A term used by both system and component designers is noise figure (NF). 
The noise figure of a component is the change in the SNR if the component 
was noiseless (a noiseless component would have NF = 0 dB). This can be rep­
resented as:

where S is the signal level and N is the noise level. The subscript i denotes input 
and o denotes output. If the “10 log” is omitted from (5.14), the ratio is called 
the noise factor (F). Generally, designers think in terms of decibels so NF is a 
more popular term.

5.2  Transistor Noise Modeling
The noise performance of a transistor can be accurately modeled and simulated 
by adding four elements to the equivalent small-signal circuit model shown in 
Figure 3.6, listed as follows.
• Thermal noise voltage source generated by the gate resistance (Vng);
• Thermal noise voltage source generated by the source resistance (Vns);
• Shot noise current source generated by the gate (ing);
• Shot noise current source generated by the drain (ind).
The enhanced circuit model with noise parameters is shown in Figure 5.4.
The equations for Vn (5.6) and Ishot (5.9) can be used as a starting point 
for the noise model. Unfortunately, the values (also called model parameters) 
for Vng, Vns, ing, and ind will need to be optimized to fit measured noise data. 
Material imperfections, parasitics, and other difficult-to-anticipate or difficult-
to-quantify factors need to be included in the model parameters.
5.3  Design Strategies and Practices
To minimize noise, a low operating DC bias is needed. However, gain is re­
duced as DC bias is reduced due to the transconductance. Therefore, the prin­
cipal trade-off made in LNA design is finding the optimal balance between 
noise and gain.

 
LNAs 
149

150 
Radar RF Circuit Design
The signal received by a radar will be extremely low in amplitude, often 
just above the noise floor, which is the lowest measurable level that is distin­
guishable from background radiation (discussed in Section 5.4). To amplify 
the signal to a level that can be processed, an RF amplifier is needed that does 
not contribute significant additional noise. This is known as an LNA. Since the 
received signal may have a power level of only -60 to -100 dBm and a typical 
LNA stage has 10–20-dB gain, multiple LNAs must be cascaded to achieve the 
necessary power level. An LNA cascade is shown in Figure 5.5.
The noise factor of the cascaded chain can be determined using the Friis 
formula for noise:

(5.18)
Since the overall gain increases with each additional stage, the denomina­
tor increases, which means that the noise contribution decreases.
Practical Note
The principal noise driver is the first stage, so it should be designed to have as low 
noise and high gain as possible. In order to overcome the noise of later stages, the 
first-stage gain must be at least 10 dB and have minimal NF—even if this means 
compromising the output return loss match.
5.3.1  Understanding Noise Circles
Similar to a power amplifier, the performance of an LNA is determined by how 
it is biased and how it is terminated. The optimal configuration can be deter­
mined by measuring a transistor with a noise parameter analyzer. The measure­
ment system measures noise performance while varying the source impedance 
and generates four noise parameters at each bias:
• NF50: The NF at 50Ω;
• NFmin: The lowest NF possible;
• Γopt or Zopt: The matching impedance where NFmin is achieved;
Figure 5.5  Cascade of LNAs with mismatch loss (MN) and gain (GN).

 
LNAs 
151
• Equivalent derivative noise resistance (Re): The rate of change in noise 
performance as the impedance deviates from Γopt. Lower values of Re 
indicate a wider range of impedances are possible with minimal degrada­
tion in NF.
By sweeping noise measurements over bias, a trade-off between NF and 
gain over a range of drain current can be made. This is shown in Figure 5.6.
Once the bias level where NF and gain are balanced is determined, noise 
circles can be drawn at that bias to determine the optimal terminating imped­
ance. Plotting circles on a Smith chart provides designers with a visual tool to 
trade off noise performance with other parameters, such as stability, VSWR, or 
gain.
A conversion can be made between impedance and reflection coefficient 
using (5.19) where Zo is the system impedance:

where F is the noise factor, Fmin is the minimum noise factor, Re is the equiva­
lent derivative noise resistance, Γopt is the optimum noise reflection coefficient, 
and Γm is the reflection coefficient of interest. Recall that NF = 10 log (F).

5.3.2  LNA Design
LNA requirements vary greatly depending on the type of radar used. Some 
factors, including size, weight, and cost, are universal to all components. Mod­
ern military radars that use AESAs may use hundreds or thousands of LNA 
elements so a strong emphasis is placed on power consumption. Alternatively, 
automotive radar places very little emphasis on power consumption since it is 
small in comparison with other vehicle systems.
Designing an LNA follows the same procedure as designing a power am­
plifier. The optimal bias is determined by trading off gain and noise (discussed 
in 5.3.1). Then, the optimal impedance is determined by plotting performance 
circles on a Smith chart. Figure 5.8 shows a set of source and load curves plot­
ted using ADS.
In Figure 5.8, on the source side (left figure), the region of instability is 
plotted to ensure that the impedance is stable. Several noise and gain circles are 
plotted so that a designer can explore the trade space. As shown in Figure 5.8, 
available gain increases as the impedance moves away from NFmin. However, 

 
LNAs 
153
there is a range of impedances within the first noise circle (the one closest to 
NFmin) that touches the second highest gain circle. That is the optimal point 
for best overall balance.
On the load side (on the right of Figure 5.8), the region of instability is 
also plotted to ensure the impedance is stable. The load impedance is gener­
ally selected for maximum power gain (particularly if this is the first LNA in a 
chain) or VSWR (not plotted).
5.3.3  Self-Bias Scheme
The biasing strategies discussed have all required separate gate and drain bias 
voltages to set the desired drain current level. However, LNAs have the option 
Figure 5.7  Example noise circles with Γopt = 0.5 < 135°, NFmin = 0.25, and Re = 0.5.

154 
Radar RF Circuit Design
of using a self-bias circuit, which only requires a single positive supply. Figure 
5.9 shows a self-bias circuit.
A resistor (Rbias) is added between the transistor source and ground. When 
drain voltage (Vd) is applied, a current (Ids) flows from the drain to the source 
through the resistor. This causes a voltage drop at the transistor source equal to 
Ids · Rbias. If the transistor gate is DC-grounded, then it will be at a lower voltage 
than the transistor source. Effectively, a negative gate-source voltage (Vgs) has 
been applied. The value of Rbias can be set to provide the desired Vgs. 
In order to work properly, a bypass capacitor must be added to provide 
the transistor with RF ground at the source. The capacitor value should be 
chosen to have low impedance at the operating frequency. Additionally, to pre­
vent shorting the RF to ground at the transistor gate, an RF-blocking inductor 
must be added. The inductor value should be chosen to have high impedance 
at the operating frequency. Since the RF-blocking inductor and DC-blocking 
capacitor have a bandwidth-limiting effect, self-biasing is not as broadband as 
traditional biasing.
Since Ids must flow through Rbias, the gain and efficiency of the transistor 
is reduced. For this reason, self-biasing is better suited for LNAs than power 
amplifiers.
5.3.4  Gain Equalizers
Gain equalizers or flatteners are used to compensate for an amplifier’s natural 
6-dB/octave drop in gain over frequency. An equalized amplifier would have 
the same gain over the operating frequency range. Unequalized gain can lead 
to signal distortions that can produce suboptimal results and artifacts in radar 
returns.
Figure 5.9  Self-biasing circuit.

 
LNAs 
155
Equalizers operate by having peak loss at low frequency, minimal loss at 
high frequency, and a desired loss slope in between. They are created by modi­
fying an attenuator (discussed in Chapter 6) so that series resistors are in paral­
lel with a capacitor and shunt resistors are in series with an inductor. At low 
frequency, capacitors are high-impedance and inductors are low-impedance so 
the resistor values are unchanged and attenuation is highest. As the frequency 
increases, the capacitor impedance drops and the inductor impedance rises to 
dampen the resistor values. This reduces the level of attenuation. Ideally at high 
frequency, the capacitors would short circuit and the inductors would open 
circuit the resistors to eliminate all attenuation. In practice, there will always be 
some loss. Figure 5.10 presents three examples of equalizer circuits.
Unfortunately, in all cases, resistors are added, which increases the NF 
of the LNA. The first two circuits are generally more popular for power am­
plifiers and should always be placed before the amplifier. Otherwise the RLC 
components must be sized to handle the high output power, and the amplifier 
efficiency will be reduced by the equalizer losses.
The rightmost circuit in Figure 5.10 can be used to equalize a power 
amplifier, but it is more popular with LNAs. It is a simple RLC circuit that 
provides feedback from the output to the input. The capacitor provides a DC 
block so that gate and drain voltages are isolated. At low frequency, the inductor 
is low-impedance so the level of feedback is maximized. At high frequency, the 
inductor is high-impedance so feedback is minimal. Since the magnitude of the 
output waveform is higher than the input, the resistor dampens the feedback 
amplitude so the right amount of cancelation is achieved.
To be effective, the RLC circuit must be placed as close to the amplifier 
transistor as possible. Otherwise, a phase delay will be introduced and feedback 
cancelation will not happen. This can be challenging, especially for packaged 
transistors (discussed in Chapter 7).
Regardless of the circuit topology used to equalize performance, it is im­
portant to minimize the resistor values by only compensating for the gain slope 
Figure 5.10  Equalizer types are shown: tee (left), pi (center), and feedback (right).

156 
Radar RF Circuit Design
needed. For example, if a specification allows for 2-dB/octave gain slope, less re­
sistance is needed in the equalizer and thermal noise is reduced by nearly 18%.
5.3.5  Resistor Component Selection
Ideally, resistors would be eliminated from the receiver chain (including the 
LNA) to minimize thermal noise. Unfortunately, that usually isn’t possible, but 
some resistors are better for noise applications than others so proper resistor 
selection can reduce NF [5].
Carbon composition resistors are made by compressing a mixture of carbon 
dust or graphite paste with a nonconducting powder. The ratio of conducting 
to nonconducting material determines the resistor value. Since they have low 
series inductance and are inexpensive to make, they are very popular for RF 
applications. They are comprised of compressed particles, so they have flicker 
noise in addition to thermal noise. At high temperature, their noise perfor­
mance degrades significantly. In total, they have the highest noise level of any 
resistor type.
Film resistors also have a layered configuration, but they use well controlled 
films that are laser-trimmed to determine the resistance value. This allows them 
to have much finer tolerances than composition resistors. Film resistors can be 
classified as thin-film or thick-film depending on the thickness of the conductive 
material. They are also known as Cermet resistors because they integrate CE­
Ramic with METal. Since the material is more homogeneous than composition 
resistors, flicker noise is less. They also degrade less at high temperature.
Wire-wound resistors are made by wrapping a thin metal alloy wire around 
an insulating ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass rod. Nichrome is typically used as 
the metal alloy. Compared to the prior resistor types, wire-wound resistors have 
no flicker noise, so they have the lowest noise. They also handle power and 
temperature very well. When choosing a wire-wound resistor, it is important to 
verify that an alternating winding pattern was used. Otherwise, the resistor will 
have a strong series inductance.
Practical Note
When multiple resistors that seem to meet the requirements are available, choose the 
one with the lowest power rating. Often, the changes made to increase power han­
dling capability also increase noise. Similarly, choose a thin-film resistor over a thick-
film resistor for the lowest noise.
5.4  High Dynamic Range
It would seem that given enough gain stages, a signal—no matter how weak—
could be amplified to any desired level. Unfortunately, there is always a limit to 

 
LNAs 
157
the smallest signal that can be amplified, and that limit is determined by noise. 
Figure 5.11 demonstrates what a signal looks like as the SNR degrades from 
∞:1 (noiseless) to 0.25:1 (signal level is four times lower than noise level).
Similarly, there is a maximum power level that the LNA can receive and 
still operate. The dynamic range of an LNA is defined as the difference in signal 
amplitude between the maximum linear power level (output is proportional 
to the input) and the minimum detectible power level (usually determined by 
noise level, low-level distortion, interference, or resolution level). This is shown 
in the Figure 5.12 power curve.
In the receiver and signal processor chain of a radar system, the minimum 
acceptable signal level may be set by the required detection probability (Pd) or 
tracking accuracy. The minimum acceptable signal level at the processor out­
put is generally 10 or more decibels above the average noise power. However, 
at the receiver output it may be far below the noise power, as the system relies 
on subsequent processing gain to achieve the high SNR required for detection 
or tracking. One must distinguish between LNA dynamic range and the com­
bined receiver and signal processor dynamic range.
Linear power is usually defined as rated output power with an associated 
IM3 or OIP3 level (discussed in Chapter 4) or at a specific compression level 
(usually 1-dB compression, or P1dB). Techniques for increasing linear power 
(and in the process increasing dynamic range) include the following:
• Incorporating a linearizer: Analog and digital linearization techniques 
are discussed in Section 4.4.3. Since adding resistive elements may be 
required, it is important to evaluate the impact on NF.
• Biasing to higher drain current: Biasing closer to class A increases the 
maximum linear power, but it also increases drain current. Figure 5.6 
shows that NFmin occurs at low drain current. A trade-off can be made 
between dynamic range and NF.
• Output-matching for high OIP3: Usually the output termination of 
an LNA is set to achieve maximum gain. In a cascade, this provides the 
lowest overall NF. However, higher dynamic range can be achieved by 
terminating at an impedance that trades gain for higher OIP3.
• Using a more linear transistor: Even within a device technology (i.e., 
GaN transistors), some foundry devices are more linear than others. 
Some foundries even offer a special linear process that trades off power 
density, voltage breakdown, or other parameters. A more linear device 
reduces the difference between Psat and max linear power.
• Using envelope termination [7]: When the signal input is comprised 
of multiple tones (f1, f2, … fN) a set of mixing products are generated 
at large signal strength. If the tone spacing is close, some of these mix­

ing products will fall well below band (i.e., f2 – f1). These products can 
be eliminated by selecting bypassing capacitor values that filter those 
frequencies. This technique is not applicable when tone spacing can be 
wide.
Since the LNA often has a much wider bandwidth than that of subse­
quent receiver stages, the noise floor at the LNA is likely much higher than that 
of the receiver. Therefore, the dynamic range can also be extended by limiting 
the bandwidth of the LNA.
5.5  Cryogenic Operation
There is an increasing interest in operating receivers at or below the cryogenic 
temperature (defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as 
–180°C, –292°F, or 93.15K). Advancements in microchillers have made cryo­
genic operation practical, particularly for military applications. Since thermal 
noise is a significant contributor to overall system noise, reducing operating 
temperature greatly improves radar receiver sensitivity (especially when external 
noise sources are low).
Electrical performance generally improves as temperature drops (i.e., gain 
and efficiency increase and loss is reduced). Designing an LNA for cryogenic 
operation requires additional considerations, including the following:
• Stability analysis with added gain: A two-stage LNA will have approxi­
mately 6.5 dB more gain at –180°C than at 25°C (0.016 dB per stage 
Figure 5.12  Power curve demonstrating definition of dynamic range.

160 
Radar RF Circuit Design
per °C). Increasing S21 by this amount can be sufficient to cause insta­
bility. This can be avoided by designing for stability at low temperature.
• Mechanical effects: The mechanical stress added by a change in tempera­
ture can be calculated from (4.98). Carrier materials and die attachment 
methods must be chosen to handle this added stress. Materials must also 
be chosen for temperature and mechanical stability at low temperature.
• Electrical effects on passive components: Lumped elements and their 
models have a fixed operating range. Commercial components are usu­
ally not tested or rated below –50°C. Component values and parasitic 
behavior can change at extreme temperatures, which can lead to an un­
expected degradation in performance.
5.6  Limiter Elimination
LNAs are designed to be sensitive over a high dynamic range, but the input 
power level is very low compared to power amplifiers (i.e., microwatt or mil­
liwatt range). Even a small pulse (or burst) of power from a neighboring trans­
mitter can be sufficient to overpower and destroy an LNA. Consequently, a 
limiter circuit is usually added between the antenna and LNA to protect the 
LNA from overpower conditions. The limiter is designed to be linear over the 
dynamic range of the LNA and reach Psat within the power handling range of 
the LNA. In the event of a burst, the limiter circuit will saturate and prevent 
excess power from reaching the LNA.
Although effective, limiters add size, weight, cost, loss, and noise to the 
receiver. The introduction of an LNA that could handle a fair amount of in­
put power level could eliminate altogether. This is not a new concept, but the 
proliferation of GaN has reenergized this topic. GaN can achieve low noise 
performance and has four to 20 times higher power handling capability than 
traditional LNA technologies (i.e., GaAs and InP).
When designing an LNA to handle high input power, the transistor size 
must be chosen accordingly. For example, an LNA that needs to handle 10-W 
continuous input power will need 2 mm of gate periphery if the power han­
dling capability is 5 W/mm (typical power density for GaN). In the case of 
GaN, biasing the drain voltage below the normal operating voltage (i.e., 28V 
or 50V) usually results in better noise performance. GaN LNAs usually operate 
in the 5–10V range.
Designing an LNA to handle high power will always result in higher NF. 
However, if the added noise is equal to or less than the noise contribution from 
the limiter, it is still a worthwhile venture since size, weight, and cost will be 
reduced.

Passive Circuitry
Amplifiers, like rock stars, seem to get all the attention, but neither could 
achieve greatness without support. Rock stars could not take center stage with­
out an army of support staff. Similarly, amplifiers rely on surrounding passive 
circuit elements to make them better. Passive circuit components can reduce or 
eliminate unwanted frequencies generated from amplifier nonlinearity. More­
over, they can compensate for impedance mismatch between components, and 
they are responsible for sending and receiving energy. These are only a few 
simple examples of what passive elements bring to the radar system.
Designed properly, passive circuits can take a radar front end to a new 
level. Designed poorly, passive circuits can really hurt performance. They can 
limit bandwidth and power handling. They always add loss and size, but if 
those are excessive, they can place an unnecessary burden on the active circuits. 
The parasitics they introduce can reduce radar performance.
This chapter discusses design strategies for the most common passive cir­
cuit components used in radars, reviewing methods to minimize layout dis­
continuities and analyze signal flow through a circuit and presenting inherent 
limitations to bandwidth and performance.
6.1  Limiting Factors and Ways to Mitigate
Before reviewing the design procedure for individual components, we present 
general issues that affect all passive circuits.

164 
Radar RF Circuit Design
6.1.1  Lumped Elements
Misconceptions about lumped elements (i.e., surface-mount components) are 
described as follows.
• Self-containment (no radiation): Components are rarely provided with 
shielding, so they will radiate (discussed in Chapter 8). Poorly placed 
components will couple and affect isolation and linearity.
• Parasitics: At RF frequencies, all components have parasitics (unwant­
ed resistance, capacitance, and inductance that arise due to the nature 
of the materials used to implement them) that can result in loss and 
changes in the circuit frequency response. Chapter 3 presents equivalent 
circuit models. Even the highest-quality lumped elements available have 
nonideal behavior at some frequency.
• Equal performance over rated band: Particularly in wideband applica­
tions, the performance of a component will change over frequency. Data 
sheets generally choose the center frequency performance to be the nom­
inal condition. So, part of the rated band will be above that number and 
part will be below. For example, a nominal 5-nH inductor may be 4.5 
nH at the low end of the frequency band and 5.5 nH at the high end.
• Loss: All of the equivalent circuit models presented in Chapter 3 include 
a resistive component, so they all have loss. This is often forgotten, es­
pecially for purely reactive elements such as capacitors and inductors. 
A reactive-element matching circuit containing multiple sections will 
inherently have loss from parasitic resistance and from the transmission 
lines that connect these sections.
• Smaller component size supports operation at higher frequency: It is 
important that the physical size be less than (and ideally much less than) 
the wavelength of the highest operating frequency. In some cases, how­
ever, the small size of a lumped component results from the need to 
reduce cost, rather than design for high-frequency performance. So it is 
important to verify the performance as well as the size before the com­
ponent is used in a high-frequency circuit.
6.1.2  Bode-Fano Limit
As discussed in Chapter 4, there are trade-offs between impedance match and 
other performance metrics (i.e., output power and efficiency). Sometimes im­
pedance match must be sacrificed to meet other objectives. When it comes to 
achieving a good impedance match over a broad bandwidth, there is a funda­

mental limitation that was determined in the 1940s and 1950s by Bode and 
Fano [1]. The Bode-Fano, which limit relates the reflection coefficient to a 
load impedance, can be used to determine the maximum bandwidth obtainable 
for a given quality match. Every impedance (R+jX) has an equivalent circuit 
comprised of a series or shunt RC or RL circuit. The Bode-Fano bandwidth-
limiting equations are listed as follows, with Γ(ω) as the reflection coefficient 
of the load:

In order to assess the meaning of (6.1)–(6.4), we can define the load as Zm

A plot of Δω versus Γmin for several values of Zm is shown in Figure 6.2.
This plot allows us to draw some important conclusions:

166 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Regardless of the load (Zm), as the bandwidth (Δω) increases, the reflec­
tion coefficient (Γmin) must also increase.
• A perfect match (Γmin = 0) can only be achieved at one frequency (Δω 
= 0).
• A near perfect mismatch (Γmin > 0.9) has an indeterminate bandwidth 
(the limit approaches infinity as  Γmin  approaches 1).
• At a fixed bandwidth, Γmin will decrease as Zm increases (in the case of a 
parallel RC load, that would require a decrease in the RC value).
Practical Note
The Bode-Fano equations proved without exception that very broadband applications 
will not achieve a good instantaneous impedance match. In practice, the theoretical 
bandwidth limit set by the Bode-Fano equations cannot be achieved. However, under­
standing this limit is important to avoid chasing an impossible specification.

6.1.3  Discontinuities
A discontinuity occurs whenever a transmission line ceases to be straight and 
perfectly continuous. This includes bends, gaps, open circuits, short circuits, 
width changes, material changes, external loadings (i.e., shunt stubs), and poor 
connections. These changes can be modeled using lumped elements and can be 
beneficial or detrimental to performance. For example, discontinuities can be 
used for filtering or impedance-matching. They can also contribute unwanted 
parasitics.
A common discontinuity is the right-angle bend. To keep layouts small, 
transmission lines are meandered like an accordion to increase electrical length 
while minimizing physical size. Figure 6.3 shows three examples of a right-angle 
bend: The leftmost image shows a cornered bend with the most parasitic induc­
tance; the center image is mitered and has reduced parasitic inductance; and the 
rightmost image shows a rounded bend with the lowest parasitic inductance.
Although rounded bends have the best performance, they are also the 
most difficult (and therefore expensive) to produce. For this reason, mitered 
bends are the most widely used. They are implemented by removing the corner, 
as shown in Figure 6.4.
A design equation for a mitered right-angle bend is available for 0.25 ≤ 
w/h ≤ 2.75 and 2.5 ≤ er ≤ 25 [2]:

where a is the dimension shown in Figure 6.4, w is the signal line width (me­
ters), and h is the substrate height (meters). The calculated value for a is not 
always the optimal value, but it is usually close.
Figure 6.3  Three types of right-angle bends with their magnitudes of parasitic inductance 
shown graphically.

168 
Radar RF Circuit Design
The most accurate way to determine the optimal miter is through full-
wave simulation (discussed in Chapter 8). Table 6.1 shows full-wave simulated 
results of return loss, insertion loss, and change in insertion phase for a 50-Ω 
(25 mil) mitered bend on 25-mil-thick alumina (εr = 9.6). The optimal miter 
is 35 mil. For comparison, the last row is for a rounded bend. The rounded 
bend loss is lower than the optimal miter, but the additional electrical length 
increases the phase response.
A similar perturbation can be made wherever there is a tee (or T) junction 
to reduce parasitic effects, as shown in Figure 6.5. 
The parasitic inductance can be reduced by removing part of the trans­
mission line as shown in Figure 6.5 (right image). As the signal propagates 
down the line, the improved tee-junction makes the split much less abrupt, so 
current hot spots are mitigated. This reduces the chance of undesired radiation.

The optimal shape of the perturbation is best determined by full-wave simula­
tion, but it is common for the inset to be 0.5 to three times the higher-imped­
ance line width.
Often, metal traces are added to serve as landing pads for optional tuning 
elements. Figure 6.6 shows an example of such a trace.
These traces are effectively parallel-plate capacitors in disguise, and their 
value should be calculated to ensure they are sufficiently low (or compensated 
for). The design equation is [2]:

high permittivity (6+), the effective capacitance is nonnegligible.
6.2  Couplers
Directional couplers are four-port components that can split or combine a sig­
nal. The four ports are labeled on two different (but equivalent) component 
symbols shown in Figure 6.8.
The through (P 2) and coupled (P 3) ports are the intended outputs. If the 
outputs are meant to be equal amplitude (3-dB coupler), then S21 = S31 = –3 
dB (plus any losses in the component). If the outputs are unequal, then the 
coupling factor (C  ) is defined by:

where P1 is the power at port 1 (W) and P3 is the power at port 3 (W).
In a perfect coupler, the Isolated (P4) port would have no output signal. 
Since no real component is perfect, there are two metrics for assessing coupler 
quality. Directivity (D) relates the output power to the coupled port and the 
isolated port and can be calculated by:

In a quadrature or 90-degree hybrid design, the outputs (ports 2 and 3) 
have a 90-degree phase difference between them. The most common quadrature 
design uses a branch-line strategy as shown in Figure 6.9. The same design can 
be implemented in a circular form where each side of the square is 90 degrees.
An equivalent circuit model is also shown in Figure 6.9 (right image). The 
component values can be determined by [3]:

To achieve broadband coupling, multiple hybrid components can be cas­
caded. Alternatively, a 90-degree Lange coupler design can be used. It is a type 
of quadrature coupler with many closely spaced parallel lines. This architecture 
is also advantageous when high coupling factors are needed. Figure 6.10 shows 
an example topology. Unfortunately, these designs can be difficult to fabricate 
because of the tight tolerances required and the need for tightly controlled wire 
bonds or air bridges. However, they can be made very compact and broadband. 
Section 7.5.1 presents an example of this architecture.
In a 180-degree hybrid, the outputs have 180 degrees phase difference 
between them. Figure 6.11 shows an example ring hybrid or rat race layout and 
the equivalent circuit model. There are a number of ways it can be operated, 
described as follows.
• When P1 is the input, P2 and P3 are in-phase outputs (90 degrees shifted 
from the input) and P4 is isolated;

and P1 is isolated;

and P4 is the difference port.

Practical Note
Directional couplers are commonly used in measurement benches to determine in­
cident and reflected power; directional couplers are also known as “reflectometers.” 
When connected in line, the input signal can be measured at the coupled port (P3) 
and the reflected power can be measured at the Isolated port (P4). 
6.3  Isolators and Circulators
Isolators and circulators are two-port and three-port (respectively) compo­
nents that force electromagnetic energy to propagate in one direction. This is 
achieved by the use of ferrites. Whenever possible, these components are gener­
ally avoided for several reasons:
• Ferrites are made from iron cores, which are heavy for their size (an issue 
for airborne platforms).
• Little can be done to significantly shrink the size of ferrites, so compo­
nents tend to be large (an issue meeting new size constraints).
• Manufacturing ferrites is a time-consuming and expensive process, 
which drives the high cost of isolators and circulators (not a low-cost 
solution).
• Ferrites are inherently narrowband. Generally wideband ferrites are an 
octave in bandwidth (suitable for half-octave radars, but not ultra-wide­
band radars).
• Ferrites are nonlinear components, so if overdriven, they will degrade in 
linearity and can even fail.
Practical Note
Isolators are just circulators with one port terminated. Often, circulators are more 
readily available off the shelf. If all you need is an isolator, consider purchasing a cir­
culator and a 50-Ω load to hasten the procurement cycle and lower the cost.
When isolators and circulators are not practical, they can be replaced with 
couplers (discussed in Section 6.2) by taking advantage of the isolation port or 
with switches to toggle between transmit and receive modes.

 
Passive Circuitry 
175
6.4  Switches
Switches are used in nearly all electronics to control the flow of a signal. In a 
radar, they can be used to toggle between transmit and receive circuitry. In a 
phased array, they are used to shift phase (Section 6.5) and attenuation (Section 
6.6).
Switches have four main parameters:
• Number of inputs (poles) and number of outputs (throws);
• Insertion loss or ON resistance (ideally zero);
• Isolation or OFF capacitance between input and output ports (ideally 
infinite);
• Reflective type (the OFF port is open or short circuit) or nonreflective/ 
absorptive/ terminated/ resistive type (the OFF port is set to the system 
impedance, usually 50Ω);
• An equivalent circuit model for an ON and OFF switch is shown in 
Figure 6.12. Cp and Rp are generic parasitic elements [3].
Unfortunately, due to the wide variety of switching technologies available, 
universal design equations for the circuit elements are not possible. These values 
are best determined empirically by fitting circuit performance to measured data.
For RF applications, solid-state switches are principally used instead of me­
chanical switches (i.e., relays) due to their faster turn-on/off speed, smaller size, 
and lower loss. In recent years, microelectrical-mechanical switches (MEMS) 
have gained in popularity in radar applications due to their broad bandwidth, 
excellent linearity, good isolation, and increasing power handling capability. 
What limits their widespread usage is increased cost and size, difficulty in inte­
gration, lower reliability, shorter lifetime, slower switching speed (microseconds 
versus nanoseconds), lower temperature handling (less than 100°C versus more

compared to solid-state switches. However, progress is being made in all of 
these areas.
In 2006, Radant MEMS, Inc., (Stow, MA) demonstrated an electroni­
cally scanning antenna for air and surface target detection using 25,000 MEMS 
switches with a scanning capability of ±60° and operated over a 1-GHz band­
width at X-band. This is believed to be the world’s first demonstration of a 
MEMS-based radar system [4]. Unfortunately due to the inherent “mechani­
cal” nature of MEMS, reliability and lifespan continue to be issues impeding 
their universal adoption.
Solid-state switches can be made from diodes (i.e., PIN switches) or tran­
sistors (i.e., FET switches). PIN switches are popular due to their high-power 
handling and low cost. However, they are more cumbersome to use because 
they require a current flow to turn ON. An example bias network is shown in 
Figure 6.13. The PIN switch is represented symbolically as a diode. 
DC-blocking capacitors are used at the input and output of the PIN 
switch to isolate current flow to that component. RF-choking inductors are 
added to prevent the signal from propagating into the voltage source or the 
ground return. Sections 4.1, 4.5, and 4.6 discuss design rules for DC blocks 
and RF chokes using (4.5) and (4.6).
FET switches are easier to use because they have dedicated low-current 
control (or enable) ports. They are also significantly faster than PIN switches. 
Figure 6.14 shows example reflective and nonreflective single-pole double-
throw (SPDT) FET switches [3].
In Figure 6.14, in the reflective (top) circuit, there is one series and two 
shunt FETs per throw. The FETs are turned ON (short circuit) and OFF (open 
circuit) through control voltages (Vc1 and Vc2). To enable output 1, Vc1 is set 
to turn ON FETs C, E, and F and Vc2 is set to turn OFF FETs A, B, and D. 
The RF signal at the input propagates across C and through output 1. FET D 
is OFF so that it blocks the signal from propagating through that path. Since 
no FET can serve as a perfect block, FETs E and F are shorted to ground so any

leakage signal is shorted to ground instead of propagating through output 2. 
Output 2 isolation is improved as additional shunt elements are added. Adding 
shunt elements improves isolation when that path is OFF, but they add loss 
when that path is ON. This trade-off drives the compromise between low in­
sertion loss and high isolation. To enable output 2, Vc1 is set to turn ON FETs 
A, B, and D and Vc2 is set to turn OFF FETs C, E, and F. The resistance of the 
OFF port in this circuit is ideally 0Ω.
In the nonreflective (bottom) circuit in Figure 6.14, there are two series 
and two shunt FETs per throw. The operation is the same as the reflected case, 
except the OFF port is connected through an additional FET to 50Ω.
In practice, switches cannot achieve perfect short- and open circuit per­
formance. The ON and OFF resistance of a FET determines the insertion loss 
and isolation of a switch. Ron can range from <10 mΩ to a few ohms, depend­
ing on transistor size and technology. Roff can range from 1 kΩ to 1 MΩ. To 
prevent RF from leaking into the bias (gate) port, resistors are added to each 
FET (Riso).  The value of this resistance must be large enough to block RF, but 
not so large as to slow down the switching speed. Typically values are 1–5 kΩ 
per millimeter of gate periphery. The control voltage to turn ON a FET (VON) 
is usually 0V or slightly higher. A FET is turned OFF (VOFF) by biasing well 
below pinch-off (< –5V).

Radar RF Circuit Design
High-power radars often use stacked-FETs (or N-FETs) to increase 
power  handling. Figure 6.15 shows a stacked-FET circuit for a single shunt 
configuration.
The RF signal is distributed across the FETs so that the total power han­
dling is increased. Increasing the number of FETs increases the power handling, 
but it also adds size. The maximum output power can be calculated from [3]:

where N is the number of transistors, VBR is the gate-drain or gate-source break­
down voltage (volts), and VP is the pinch-off voltage (volts). Since there is a 
squared relationship, doubling the number of transistors quadruples the power 
handling.
The operating frequency range of a switch can be improved by adding 
components to compensate for the parasitic elements shown in Figure 6.12. 
For example, adding a series inductance between shunt FETs will minimize the 
parasitic capacitance and extend the frequency range. Using devices with low 
COFF (such as small gate length devices) will also improve operating frequency.
If a single negative voltage is not available, bias can be implemented using 
two positive voltages as shown in Figure 6.16 [3].
A fixed voltage (Vfixed) is applied to the source terminal of the FET. The 
voltage should be set to |VOFF |. If the control voltage (Vc ) is set to 0V, then VGS 
= –VOFF and the FET is OFF. If Vc is set to |VOFF |, then VGS = 0V (the gate and 
source are at the same voltage potential) and the FET is ON.

6.5  Phase Shifters
All components have electrical length so they exhibit a phase response. If mul­
tiple signals are being combined, combining efficiency is maximized when the 
signals are in-phase. Phase shifters can be added to compensate for phase mis­
alignment by delaying one of the signals until the other is in alignment. In 
an AESA, changing the relative phase within the antenna array enables elec­
tronic beam steering. An example switched-line phase shifter is shown in Figure 
6.17. The gaps indicate the location of a switch that enable signal propagation 
through that path. The l1 path is enabled by turning ON the top two switches 
and turning OFF the bottom two. The l2 path is enabled by turning ON the 
bottom two switches and turning OFF the top two.
The phases of the l1 and l2 paths are:

The circuit shown in Figure 6.17 is a one-bit phase shifter with two pos­
sible phase shifts. More than one of these components can be cascaded to cre­
ate a multibit phase shifter. The four-bit phase shifter shown in Figure 6.18 is 
capable of 16 relative phase shifts (0° to 337.5° in 22.5° increments). Compact 
designs are also possible [5].
6.6  Attenuators
Attenuators are two-port components that add loss (or remove gain) wherever 
they are placed. When so much effort is spent to reduce loss, it may seem 
strange that anyone would want to add loss to a system. However, in applica­
tions where a broadband match is needed and excess gain is available, adding an

attenuator will correct a poor VSWR. A small attenuator at the input or output 
of an amplifier can maintain stability even when presented with an open or 
short circuit. Attenuators also serve as broadband loads for terminating isola­
tion ports of couplers or isolators.
The three most popular attenuator circuits are the tee, bridged tee, and pi 
networks. Figure 6.19 shows all three of these circuits [6].
The design equations are presented as follows, with A as the desired at­
tenuation (dB).

Generally, the most appropriate circuit is the one with the most conve­
nient resistor values for the attenuation needed. Figure 6.20 shows values for R1 
and R2 as the attenuation is swept from 0 to 40 dB. Zout is set to 50Ω. Regard­
less of the circuit approach, very low attenuation levels are difficult to realize 
due to the very small or very large resistor values needed.
6.7  Filters/Diplexers 
Filters are components that attenuate unwanted frequencies (the stopband) and 
transmit desired frequencies (the passband) with as little loss as possible. There 
are five types of filters:
• Low-pass: Only low frequencies propagate;
Figure 6.20  R1 and R2 as attenuation is swept from 0 to 40 dB.

 
Passive Circuitry 
183
• High-pass: Only high frequencies propagate;
• Bandpass: Only a frequency range of interest propagates;
• Bandstop (also known as band reject or notch): All frequencies except a 
range of interest propagate;
• Multipass (or multistop): Multiple regions of frequencies pass (or are 
rejected).
Unfortunately, no filter is precise enough to pass one frequency and reject 
the frequency infinitesimally lower or higher. Instead, filters have skirts that 
can be designed to roll off quickly or slowly. Higher-order filters roll off more 
quickly than lower-order filters, but they require more elements and size (which 
adds loss). Additionally, the faster the roll-off, the more ripple that occurs in the 
passband. A response that has a moderate skirt slope and flat passband is called 
a maximally flat or Butterworth response. A response that has a steep skirt slope 
and an equal-amplitude ripple passband is called a Chebyshev (or Tchebychev) 
response. Figure 6.21 illustrates these terms. 
Group delay is the time required to propagate through the filter. Having 
constant group delay allows signals to remain undistorted due to frequency 
dispersion. Pulses, for example, will maintain their rise and fall times if group 
delay is small.
Filters are one of the most commonly published RF components, and 
design strategies are as varied as the authors themselves. Using a simulator

with built-in design guides (discussed in Chapter 8) is really advantageous 
for determining the best design strategy. Figure 6.22 shows a distributed and 
lumped-element filter designed using Keysight ADS’ Filter and Passive Circuit 
DesignGuides. The filters provide maximally flat performance from 8 to 12 
GHz (all of X-band) with 30-dB rejection 1 GHz out of band (meaning S21 at 
frequencies below 7 GHz and above 13 GHz must be 30 dB below the S21 level 
between 8 and 12 GHz). With this information, the designer can determine 
whether a distributed or lumped-element approach works best.
6.8  Splitters/Combiners
Power splitters (or dividers) enable a signal to be split into two or more separate 
paths. Both amplitude and phase can be designed to be equal or unequal at the 
output. Common applications include feeding networks for an antenna array 
or a bank of parallel-combined power amplifiers.
Power combiners receive two or more signals. As with splitters, they can 
be designed to receive equal or unequal amplitude and phase. The most com­
mon application is to combine the output power from multiple sources.
The Wilkinson power divider offers isolation at the output ports using a 
resistor. In the three-port, equal-split configuration (shown in Figure 6.23), all 
ports are matched to Zo. This makes it a very versatile design that has led to its 
widespread use.
Practical Note
Isolation between output ports is important in real applications. If a splitter circuit 
does not provide isolation (as is the case in a simple tee junction), a change in imped­
ance at any port will affect the impedance at all other ports. This can have a significant 
impact on circuits that are sensitive to input impedance, such as receivers. At least 
10-dB isolation should always be implemented.
The Wilkinson typology supports unequal power ratios as well, as shown 
in Figure 6.24 [7].
The power ratio between port 2 and port 3 (P3/P2) can be calculated from:

Notice that the output ports are both multiplied and divided by the 
square root of the power ratio (RP). For large power ratios, this can be prob­
lematic. For example, if RP is 10 and the system impedance is 50Ω, the output 
port impedances will be multiplied and divided by 3.16 (158.11Ω and 15.81Ω 
respectively). Matching networks will need to be added at port 2 and port 3 to 
match to 50Ω.
Figure 6.25 shows a circuit that is matched to 50Ω at all ports and in­
corporates a matching network at the input (Z1) [6]. The design equations for

When the power split ratio is large, the use of high and low impedance 
signal traces is unavoidable. Some substrate configurations are better suited to 
realize high and low impedance lines concurrently. Figure 6.26 shows the range

of matchable impedances versus substrate thickness for three permittivity val­
ues. The range of impedance values is defined as the impedance range achiev­
able if the signal width is varied from 10 mils to 250 mils. Figure 6.26 shows 
that low permittivity and thick substrates are better for matching low and high 
impedance values. 
The Wilkinson topology also supports configurations with more than two 
outputs. Such components are called N-way configurations. Figure 6.27 shows 
four-way layout. All paths have an impedance of the square root of N multi­
plied by the system impedance (in the case of Figure 6.27, 4 Zo = 2Zo) and are 
λ/4 in length. The isolation resistors are equivalent to the system impedance. 
Notice that all resistors share a common terminal.
The difficulty designing an N-way Wilkinson is with the layout. All paths 
must have the same physical length and that is challenging to accomplish while 
maintaining enough distance to prevent coupling. Furthermore, the isolation

ity values 2, 6, and 10.

resistors must jump over the RF signal traces, and for best results, symmetry 
should be maintained in all paths. Figure 6.28 shows a layout of a 10-GHz 
four-way splitter on 25-mil-thick substrate (εr = 6). Two wire bonds are needed 
on the output for isolation.
6.9  Baluns
For DC current to flow in a circuit, there must be a closed loop. Breaking the 
loop (say, by toggling a switch or removing a series component) will cause DC 
current to stop flowing. Similarly, when an RF signal propagates down a trans­
mission line, there is a current return. In a single-ended component, such as a 
microstrip circuit, the current return is through a dedicated ground plane. Since 
there are two conductors and one is at a lower potential than the other, this is 
known as an unbalanced configuration.
Alternatively, a single-ended component can be implemented in a dif­
ferential configuration. Figures 2.17 and 2.22 present examples of differential 
transmission lines. In this case, a pair of conductors transmits the signal voltage 
so neither is dedicated as ground. The two conductors have equal but opposite 
amplitude, so this is known as a balanced configuration. The phase between 
conductors is 180 degrees.
A balun is a component that converts between an unbalanced and bal­
anced configuration (or vice versa). The name balun comes from the words bal­
anced-unbalanced. They are commonly used to implement push-pull amplifiers 
Figure 6.27  A four-way equal-split Wilkinson power divider layout.

190 
Radar RF Circuit Design
(discussed in Chapter 4.3.3), to feed dipole antennas, and as a power splitter/
combiner wherever 180-degree phase shifts between signals can be used.
There are three popular methods for designing baluns for radar. The first 
utilizes a quarter-wave length of coax line as shown in Figure 6.29. The outer 
conductor is connected to common ground on the unbalanced end. The center 
and outer conductors create the balanced end on the other side of the coax. 
Unfortunately, due to mechanical limitations, coax lines are only practical at 
lower frequencies.
Planar baluns are popular because they are practical at higher frequencies. 
Although there are many planar architectures, two common ones are shown in 
Figure 6.30. The structure on the left of Figure 6.30 looks similar to a CPW 
Figure 6.28  Actual layout of 10-GHz four-way splitter on 25-mil-thick substrate with permit­
tivity of 6.

transmission line except only one unbalanced end is connected to common 
ground. The length of the coupled lines is quarter-wave. The structure can also 
be realized without the second ground trace, but the bandwidth will be re­
duced. The structure on Figure 6.30’s right is a Marchand balun. It has similar 
bandwidth to the edge-coupled design but trades increased size (half-wave ver­
sus quarter-wave) for no wire bonds. 
When multilayer architectures are an option, the parallel-plate balun 
shown in Figure 6.31 can be used. If the balun is attached to a component that 
isn’t driven from the topside, it offers a convenient end-launch style connection.
Baluns are judged based on the following:
• Amplitude balance: A perfect balun would have equal amplitude signals 
propagating from each conductor of the balanced port. A real balun will 
generally have 0.5–1 dB amplitude imbalance.
• Phase balance: A perfect balun would have 180-degree phase shift be­
tween the signals propagating from the balanced port. A real balun will 
generally have ±10-degree phase imbalance.
• Common mode rejection ratio (CMRR): If two identical signals are 
fed into the balanced port, the 180-degree phase shift between them 
should cause them to cancel completely. Therefore, in an ideal balun, the 
Figure 6.30  Planar balun layouts: edge-coupled (left) and Marchand (right).

192 
Radar RF Circuit Design
CMRR would be infinite. Since real baluns have amplitude and phase 
imbalance, the CMRR indicates how closely the two signals would can­
cel. Most baluns have CMRR greater than 25 dB.
There are two additional benefits to using a balun:
1.	 When combining two equivalent nonlinear components (i.e., a pair 
of power amplifiers), all even-order harmonics are cancelled. This is 
due to the out-of-phase nature of the balanced signals. Baluns cancel 
harmonics over the entire operating frequency range (which can be a 
decade or more).
2.	 It is possible to implement an impedance shift as part of a balun. 
Generally, impedance shifting or impedance matching baluns are 
expressed by their unbalanced-to-balanced impedance ratio. For ex­
ample, a 1:4 balun would shift a 50-Ω unbalanced port to a 200-Ω 
balanced port, and a 4:1 balun would shift a 50-Ω unbalanced port to 
a 12.5-Ω balanced port. This is useful for matching high-impedance 
(i.e., antennas) and low-impedance (i.e., large power amplifiers) cir­
cuits. Figure 6.32 shows a 1:4 planar balun.
6.10  Mixers
Modern radar would not be possible without mixers. In most systems, the fre­
quencies used to seek and track objects are much higher than analog-to-digital 
converters (ADC) can process. Therefore, the RF frequency is downconverted 
to something that can be accurately transformed to digital and processed. Like­
wise, digital waveforms are transformed to analog using a digital-to-analog con­
verter (DAC) and upconverted to the appropriate RF frequency. This frequency 
transformation is provided by the mixer. Multiple mixers can be cascaded when 
large-scale transformation is needed. 
Figure 6.31  Orthogonal view (left) and top view (right) of a parallel-plate balun layout.

 
Passive Circuitry 
193
A mixer is a three-port device as shown in Table 1.2. The three ports are 
for RF, LO, and intermediate frequency (IF). Mixers are reciprocal devices, 
so they can be used as both frequency upconverters and downconverters. For 
down-conversion, RF is the input and IF is the output. For up-conversion, IF 
is the input and RF is the output (two tones represent high and low side). In 
both cases, LO (discussed in Chapter 4) is an input that provides the multiply­
ing frequency. The input and output frequencies are shown in Figure 6.33 [8]. 
For example, 5 GHz at the RF port and 6 GHz at the LO port will pro­
duce 1 GHz at the IF port (down-conversion). Alternatively, 1 GHz at the IF 
port and 6 GHz at the LO port will produce 5 GHz (RF1) and 7 GHz (RF2) 
at the RF port (up-conversion).
Mixers can be designed in many ways, but two popular designs are the 
single- and double-balanced mixers shown in Figure 6.34. The hybrid coupler 
outputs are 180 degrees out of phase, which means they could be replaced with 
a balun. Double-balanced mixers have the benefit of improved linearity at the

IF port and lower conversion loss (RF power-IF power) than single-balanced 
mixers [8].
No DC power is needed for a mixer to operate so it is a passive device. 
However, since it contains nonlinear elements (i.e., diodes or transistors), mix­
ers are also nonlinear. If enough input power is provided, a mixer will saturate 
just like an amplifier. Additional (usually unwanted) tones will be generated 
when a mixer becomes nonlinear. 
6.11  Antennas
Antennas are components that transform the system impedance (usually 50Ω) 
to the free-space impedance (377Ω, derived in Chapter 8) to facilitate radia­
tion. Antenna design is a complete and extensive topic in itself and interested 
readers are encouraged to read [9]. For the purposes of this book, the key defini­
tions are listed as follows.
• Radiator: The part of an antenna that radiates (propagates electromag­
netic energy);
• Reflector: An optional part of an antenna that focuses radiated energy 
in a desired direction;
• Boresight: The direction the antenna is pointing;
• Boresight error (BSE): The difference between boresight and the direc­
tion of maximum radiated intensity;
• Beam or lobe: The volume of radiated energy directed away from the 
antenna;
• Sidelobe: Radiation in an unwanted direction;
Figure 6.34  Single- (top) and double- (bottom) balanced mixer.

 
Passive Circuitry 
195
• Peak sidelobe ratio: Ratio of the highest sidelobe and the main beam 
intensity;
• NdB beamwidth: The width of the main beam (in degrees) where the 
gain is within NdB of maximum (typically, 3 dB);
• Azimuth (AZ): The direction of a reference point looking “left to right” 
or along the XY-plane (expressed from 0–360 degrees or –180–180 de­
grees);
• Elevation (EL): The direction of a reference point looking “up and 
down” or along the Z-axis (expressed from -90° to 90°);
• Range: The distance from the antenna to a reference point;
• Antenna or radiation pattern: A 2D or 3D plot of field strength in space;
• Isotropic antenna: An antenna capable of radiating with equal field 
strength in all directions with no loss (not feasible in practice);
• Gain: The ratio of the field strength at boresight (typically) compared 
with the field strength of an isotopic antenna;
• Directivity: The ratio of the field strength at boresight (typically) com­
pared with the field strength of the antenna averaged over all directions;
• Omnidirectional antenna: An antenna capable of radiating with equal 
field strength in all azimuthal directions (appears as a circle on an an­
tenna pattern plot).
6.12  Current Density Analysis
Compared with active circuits, passive components are relatively straightfor­
ward to design. When circuits do not work in simulation as expected, it’s often 
difficult to know where to begin diagnosis. A great starting point is to look at 
current density plots. Figure 6.35 was generated using ADS; on the left is a 
meandered delay line, and on the right is the same delay line with a 1-mil gap 
(break) in the signal line.
Using ADS, a designer can plot the flow of current through the signal 
path. In the figure above, the line length is greater than a wavelength so a dark 
spot appears where the signal is zero. When viewed in time-varying mode, the 
dark spot (and neighboring light spots) traverse the signal path. 
Discontinuities usually show up as an interruption to the signal flow. Ar­
eas of concentrated current indicate possible sources of radiation and failure. 
Adding miters or smoothing sharp corners can reduce high current concentra­
tion areas. If it is determined that excessive current is being driven into a narrow 
line, that signal trace should be widened (preferred) or thickened to handling

the current load. Otherwise, the metal trace is likely to heat up, expand, delami­
nate, and break open.
Current density analysis can also be used to check for unwanted coupling. 
If two metal traces couple due to their close proximity, signal from one trace 
will show up on the other. Figure 6.36 shows the pad locations for a simple DC 
bias network and matching circuit. In the left image of Figure 6.36, coupling 
is found between the signal line and the DC feed line as indicated by the light 
grey color on the DC feed. This can be resolved by increasing the spacing be­
tween traces, as shown in the right image of Figure 6.36.
Alternatively, the DC feed could be shielded to prevent coupling (dis­
cussed in Chapter 8).

Microwave Integrated Circuits
The RF front end is a general term for all components between the antenna and 
the ADC or DAC. For the transmitter, this includes the frequency upconverter, 
power amplifier, filter(s), and antenna. For the receiver, this includes the anten­
na, LNA, filter(s), and frequency downconverter. Both sides leverage the passive 
circuit elements presented in Chapter 6 to modify the signal(s) as needed.
With an understanding of the individual passive and active circuit ele­
ments, the focus of the book turns toward integration. Just like quality ingredi­
ents must be combined properly to make a great meal, the best RF components 
must be integrated intelligently to make a great radar.
This chapter discusses different types of component, subassembly, and 
packaging form factors. Since radars can operate pulsed or CW, design con­
siderations for both types of operation are included. In addition, the chapter 
presents techniques for utilizing simulators to quickly and accurately determine 
module performance and lists the most commonly used radar component spec­
ifications, which are often derived from military standards. Finally, the chapter 
reviews strategies for improving manufacturability and yield, since a radar that 
outperforms expectations but cannot be manufactured is unacceptable.
7.1  Component Integration
In most cases, a front end is assembled by integrating components from mixed 
technologies; usually some components are purchased COTS, and some are 
produced in-house. This section presents the various types of components that 
are usually encountered and the best ways to integrate them.

Radar RF Circuit Design
7.1.1  MMIC
An RF circuit that is fabricated on a single piece of semiconductor substrate is 
called a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC). The word monolithic 
is derived from the Greek words monos (single) and lithos (stone). As discussed 
throughout the book, common RF semiconductors used in radar include GaAs, 
GaN, and InP. Figure 7.1 presents a MMIC.
Although there are MMICs that only contain passive circuits, most 
MMICs are amplifiers of one form or another. Transistors rely on semiconduc­
tors to operate, so it makes sense to integrate an amplifier and other functional­
ity with it.
Arguably the most beneficial feature of a MMIC is the precise fabrica­
tion tolerance offered and inherent compactness. MMIC metal traces can have 
submicron tolerance, whereas printed circuit board manufacturers generally 
charge a premium when less than one mil (submil) tolerance is needed (1 mil = 
Figure 7.1  Image of a GaAs MMIC. (From Meharry, D. E., et al., “Multi-Watt Wideband MMICs 
in GaN and GaAs,” IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium, June 2007, pp.631–634.

25.4 μm). Semiconductor substrates are nearly flawless, whereas printed circuit 
boards usually have 10% tolerance on both thickness and permittivity. With 
this level of precision, a MMIC circuit can be fully optimized to minimize 
parasitic effects, shrink size, and realize premium performance.
As is usually the case in engineering, there are trade-offs to using MMICs. 
Foundries that produce MMICs have strict rules on how circuits can be laid 
out. It takes time to ensure that all design rules are followed and that no un­
wanted coupling can happen between metal traces. Consequently, the design 
process for MMICs is typically longer, which adds engineering cost to the ef­
fort. A printed circuit board can be fabricated in days, but a MMIC requires at 
least six weeks to fabricate. Additionally, semiconductors are more costly than 
printed circuit boards, so this raises the material expense. For high-power ap­
plications, dissipating the heat generated from a small area can be a challenge 
(discussed in Chapter 8).
7.1.2  Hybrid
A hybrid circuit closely integrates two or more components (or subcomponents) 
to perform a single function. For example, a single diced transistor (called a dis­
crete transistor) can be bonded to external circuits that contain the input- and 
output-matching circuits. Often a hybrid is used instead of a MMIC due to the 
following factors:
• Availability of parts: If existing in-house or COTS parts are being used 
with incompatible form factors, their interfaces can be matched using a 
hybrid.
• Lower cost: For expensive semiconductors, such as GaN-on-silicon car­
bide, matching circuit components can be placed off-MMIC to reduce 
the size of the semiconductor and lower cost.
• Broader bandwidth: Techniques that offer broader bandwidth by de­
signing multisection components, such as multistage couplers or match­
ing networks, may be more easily realized off-MMIC.
• Thermal considerations: For high-power applications, combining mul­
tiple components of moderate power level spreads the heat better than 
producing a single high-power component.
• Better manufacturing yield: As MMICs become larger, they become 
more difficult to fabricate and handle. Keeping the MMIC small in­
creases foundry yield and assembly yield.
• Form factor: Greater flexibility to the overall size and shape is provided 
by a hybrid so fitting to an existing form factor is much easier.

Radar RF Circuit Design
When integrating multiple components, it is important to ensure that 
ground path integrity has been maintained. Figure 7.2 shows a side view of 
two MMICs being integrated from different substrates. The signal path in­
tegrity between MMICs is maintained by keeping wire bond lengths short. 
However, the ground path must travel down through the first substrate, across 
the gap, and up through the second substrate. For thick substrates, this can add 
significant phase difference between the signal and ground, which can excite 
higher-order modes. To avoid this, bond wires can be added topside to con­
nect the grounds from both MMICs. Most MMICs are designed with coplanar 
waveguide launches to enable direct topside ground connections.
7.1.3  Multichip Modules (MCMs)
Multiple MMICs, packaged components, and/or hybrid circuits can be integrat­
ed to create a MCM. In this configuration, multiple functions are performed, 
such as filtering, built-in test, and amplification. As unpackaged MMICs (also 
called bare die) are becoming more widely available, COTS MCMs are becom­
ing more popular.
To make assembly, testing, and debugging easier, MCMs are usually the 
building blocks for higher-level assemblies. Figure 7.3 shows an example of 
what a MCM could look like. Multiple types of packages are integrated to­
gether (discussed in Section 7.1.4) to form a single module. A substrate is added 
to provide transmission lines to connect the components together (transmission 
lines not shown). Bare die are connected to other components through wire 
bonds. (For simplicity, only four are shown.) Each of the dark gray components 
is a hybrid circuit that can be individually tested for compliance before integrat­
ing into the next higher-level assembly.
Components that generate a lot of heat cannot be attached directly to 
the substrate. From the thermal conductivity of the material, the rise in tem­
perature due to heat generated from the component can be determined (dis­
cussed in Chapter 4). If the temperature rise is above the maximum operating

temperature, then a more efficient thermal path to the heat sink (in this case the 
metal carrier) must be implemented.
One method for improving the thermal path to the heat sink is to attach 
the heat source (i.e., MMIC or hybrid circuit) on top of a via field. A via field, 
shown in Figure 7.4, is a region of the substrate that has been tightly packed 
with metal-filled vias. This is generally easy to implement in the substrate and 
does not add any board-level assembly steps.
For optimal heat removal, the best method is to attach the heat source 
directly to the heat sink. In this example, that requires removing a section of 
the substrate and mounting the MMIC or hybrid directly to the metal carrier. 
This is shown in Figure 7.5. Since the MMIC or hybrid resides inside the sub­
strate, the wire bonds connecting to the external components will be longer by 
at least the substrate height. This difference must be taken into consideration.

Radar RF Circuit Design
For example, the added inductance from adding 25 mil of wire bond length is 
sufficient to shift a 10-GHz resonance to 11.8 GHz.
7.1.4  Packaging Options
It is not uncommon for a package to add 0.5–1-dB loss (not to mention a 
reactive element) to a component’s performance. Unfortunately, the effects of 
packaging are often overlooked or underestimated. As component performance 
improves with new materials and techniques, packaging effects can drive overall 
performance.  Although high-quality and high-frequency packaging options are 
available, they can be costly. Some of the more popular packaging options (bot­
tom view) are shown in Figure 7.6 and discussed in this section.
Flange-Mount Package
This is the industry standard for any component that operates with more than 
10W DC power (or dissipated power, PDC). The component is mounted di­
rectly to a metal carrier, which is then screwed onto the heat sink. Since there is 
direct metal-to-metal contact, this package offers superb thermal and electrical 
performance. Flanges extend from the input and output to be soldered to the 
substrate. A ceramic or plastic lid can be added to encapsulate the component. 
If the lid is ceramic, the package can be made hermetic (blocks moisture). These 
packages can be designed to operate well into millimeter-wave frequencies.
The downside to this package is the size. Since it is screwed down, surface 
area is consumed by the attachment method. Most flange-mount packages have 
two or four ports, so DC and RF signals share a port.
QFL Package
For components that operate with less than 10 W DC power, the QFL package 
is a more easily integrated option. As shown in Figure 7.6 (center image), many 
Figure 7.5   Heat source with improved thermal path using a direct carrier attach.

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
207
ports are available on a QFL so DC and RF ports can be handled separately. 
Since the leads extend away from the package, they are easy to solder into and 
out of modules. Often the leads are formed with a bent or gull wing shape so 
that the bottom of the leads are flush with the bottom of the package. In the 
center of the package bottom is a metal pad called a paddle, which serves as 
both the thermal and electrical path to ground. This package can also support 
millimeter-wave frequencies.
Other than the power-handling limitation, this package is also limited by 
the number of ports it can handle. Since all leads are placed on the perimeter, 
ports must be spaced adequately to prevent coupling.
QFN Package
If the leads that extend beyond the edge of a QFL are trimmed away, the result­
ing package would be a QFN package. The footprint size for this package is 
smaller than a QFL, but it is more difficult to assemble into a module. Some 
QFN packages have castellated ports, which means the metal wraps around the 
edge. This makes assembly easier.
This package has the same power and port limitations as the QFL. How­
ever, additional ports can be added by changing the interface to a ball grid array 
(BGA), which uses a series of bumps on the backside of the package as ports. 
Since the distance from the component to the port is minimized, a BGA offers 
low port inductance and higher operating frequencies.
Metal Package
A metal package (not shown in Figure 7.6) can be made to fit any size compo­
nent. If hermeticity is not an issue, an inexpensive way to protect a component 
is to screw a folded-metal lid over it. Stainless steel is often used because it 
is easy to machine. Alternatively, a hermetic package can be implemented by 
welding the metal lid to a metal carrier.
Small metal covers are often called dog houses because of their resemblance 
to the namesake. They provide a convenient mechanism for electromagnetic 
shielding (discussed in Chapter 8).

packages.

208 
Radar RF Circuit Design
Plastic Package
Similarly to a metal package, a plastic package can be extruded to fit any size 
component. Due to their light weight and low cost in volume, they are becom­
ing increasingly popular. Although the lid material is plastic, the inside can be 
metal-coated to become hermetic. Additionally, the plastic can be formulated 
to prevent static or provide magnetic or electric shielding (discussed in Chapter 
8). Some plastic packages have even been formulated to pass U.S. military stan­
dards (discussed in Section 7.3).
7.2  Packaging Model
A simple model for a symmetric package is shown in Figure 7.7, where the 
subscript “Ext” is for external parasitics, “Int” is for internal parasitics, and “P” 
is for generic parasitics.
These values are generally determined empirically by replacing the com­
ponent with a 50-Ω thru line and fitting the parameters to measured S-parame­
ters. At low frequency, the inductor and resistor values can be determined since 
the capacitors are essentially open circuits. Then, the capacitors can be tuned to 
meet the higher-frequency behavior.
To test the model, the component can be replaced by a short to ground. 
The modeled and measured S11 magnitude and phase should match. If needed, 
the simple model can be expanded to include delay lines (to match phase) and 
a single input-to-output capacitance (if port-to-port isolation is not sufficiently 
high to be negligible).
7.3  Designing for U.S. Military Standards
The United States has created a library of documents that clearly define how 
military systems must be built and tested. They cover every detail from how

long silver epoxy should be cured through how resilient a system must be to 
fungal growth. For components, there are several commonly referenced military 
standards for components. (Note that when searching for these documents, let­
ters are often added after the name to denote the version.)
MIL-STD-883 entitled “Test Method Standard—Microcircuits” [1]
Scope: This standard establishes uniform methods, controls, and procedures for 
testing microelectronic devices suitable for use within military and aerospace 
electronic systems including basic environmental tests to determine resistance 
to deleterious effects of natural elements and conditions surrounding military 
and space operations; mechanical and electrical tests; workmanship and train­
ing procedures; and such other controls and constraints as have been deemed 
necessary to ensure a uniform level of quality and reliability suitable to the 
intended applications of those devices.
MIL-PRF-19500 entitled “General Specification for Semiconductor Devices” [2]
Scope: This specification establishes the general performance requirements for 
semiconductor devices. Product assurance is provided by effective screening, 
conformance inspection, and process controls to mitigate risk.
MIL-PRF-38534 entitled “General Specification for Hybrid Microcircuits” [3]
Scope: This specification establishes the general performance requirements 
for hybrid microcircuits, MCMs and similar devices, and the verification re­
quirements for ensuring that these devices meet the applicable performance 
requirements.
MIL-PRF-38535 entitled “General Specification for Integrated Circuits 
(Microcircuits) Manufacturing” [4] 
Scope: This specification establishes the general performance requirements for 
integrated circuits or microcircuits and the quality and reliability assurance re­
quirements, which are to be met for their acquisition. The intent of this speci­
fication is to allow the device manufacturer the flexibility to implement best 
commercial practices to the maximum extent possible while still providing 
product that meets military performance needs.
MIL-STD-1835 entitled “Electronic Component Case Outlines” [5]
Scope: This standard establishes and maintains a compilation of electronic 
component case outlines and should be useful to all levels of manufacturing 
that culminate in the production of reliable and logistically supportable elec­
tronic equipment. The purpose of this standard is to assure complete mechani­
cal interchangeability of all electronic component case outlines of a particular 
style and type, regardless of source, commensurate with the requirements of 
high-density electronic equipment manufacturing.

210 
Radar RF Circuit Design
MIL-STD-461 entitled “Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic 
Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment” [6]
Scope: This standard establishes interface and associated verification require­
ments for the control of the electromagnetic interference (emission and sus­
ceptibility) characteristics of electronic, electrical, and electromechanical equip­
ment and subsystems designed or procured for use by activities and agencies 
of the Department of Defense. Such equipment and subsystems may be used 
independently or as an integral part of other subsystems or systems.
System designers tend to specify which items within the standard apply 
to a particular system. Testing for military standard compliance is expensive, so 
it is best to avoid testing irrelevant standards (i.e., testing operational perfor­
mance at high altitude on a ground vehicle platform). The military standards 
we describe here total 1,734 pages of detail, so this section will discuss only the 
key design parameters.
7.3.1  Robustness
Military radar must handle extreme environmental, mechanical, and electrical 
stress (which is why there are so many lengthy military standards). A certain 
level of robustness must be met, and a component is only as strong as the weak­
est area. It is important to differentiate between the following:
• Safe operating limit: The stress level at which the component can oper­
ate over the expected lifetime without degrading performance;
• Deteriorated operating limit: The stress level at which the component 
can operate over the expected lifetime with degraded performance;
• Survivability limit: The stress level at which the component can operate 
but over which any additional stress will cause permanent damage.
These limits determine the subcomponent ratings. For example, all capac­
itors have a maximum safe operating voltage and a survivability voltage limit. 
Suppose that a capacitor can operate for 1 × 106 hours at 100V and has a break­
down (survivability) voltage of 150V. If analysis shows that under all operating 
conditions and assembly tolerances (see the Monte Carlo analysis in Chapter 
8) the peak voltage at a particular node is 98V, then that capacitor is properly 
rated for use at that node. In most cases, designers use a safely factor of two to 
three times rated value to provide margin. So, in this case, it would be better to 
choose a capacitor with safe operating voltage of 200–300V.

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
211
Practical Note
Be wary of excessive derating. If a design engineer determines that a capacitor at a 
particular node will never experience voltages above 50V, there is no need to choose 
a component rated for 500V. Larger-rated parts are usually physically larger and have 
more parasitics than lower-rated parts. Manufacturers also derate their components so 
there is no need to over derate.
Substrates also have a rated value that is sometimes overlooked. The di­
electric strength (or electrical strength) is the voltage that a material can with­
stand before dielectric breakdown occurs. It is the same principal that causes 
high voltages to arc through air. The likelihood of voltage breakdown can be 
aggravated by surface moisture and contamination. Once breakdown occurs, 
the substrate is degraded permanently. The dielectric strength of a substrate 
(ζmax) can be calculated by:
	
max
max
V
d
ζ


= 



	
(7.1)
where V is the voltage (V) and d is the substrate thickness (m). Dielectric 
strength values for microwave materials typically range between 20 and 30 kV/
mm (500–750 V/mil).
When attaching a MMIC, hybrid, or substrate to a carrier in a military 
environment, there are four principal options:
• Mechanical: Attaching two materials through purely mechanical means 
(i.e., bolting them together) is rarely a good idea. Surfaces are never 
perfectly flat so air pockets form and prevent good thermal and electrical 
contact. The problem is exacerbated as temperature change causes ex­
pansion and contraction. Any sort of sustained vibration will eventually 
wear down the components. Mechanical attach should never be used at 
RF frequencies or higher.
• Film: Sheet epoxy, sheet solder, and indium foil are popular due to their 
ease of use. They are comprised of thin sheets of material that can be 
cut to size, placed between the components being attached, compressed, 
and heated until molten. Once the heat is removed, the film solidifies, 
and attachment is made. Although convenient to handle, films tend to 
have low thermal and electrical conductivity compared to paste epoxy 
or solder, which can cause a rise in operating temperature and higher 
loss. Indium foil does not require heating for attachment, but it does 

212 
Radar RF Circuit Design
suffer from mechanical creep (the condition where repeated stress causes 
degradation).
• Epoxy: Silver-loaded epoxies are pastes that can be spread by hand or 
with an automated system to the areas needed. Since they are silver-
loaded, thermal and electrical conductivities are high. They are also rich 
with lead, which makes them soft and flexible. This is advantageous for 
applications with large temperature swings or vibration requirements. 
Some epoxies come as two-part chemicals that must be precisely mixed 
right before application. They must also be stored cold and have a short 
shelf life. At high temperatures, they can become brittle and break down 
electrically so they are not applicable for high-power applications (as 
determined by the manufacturer’s maximum operating temperature).
• Solder: Au/Sn (80% gold/20% tin) solder is the staple for military ap­
plications. It is robust and offers excellent thermal and electrical perfor­
mance. It works well in high-power applications. It is usually applied 
in a bell jar with nitrogen- or hydrogen-forming gas. The consistency 
is not as smooth as epoxy, so it can be challenging to apply. It is also 
harder than lead-based solders, so it has less mechanical flexibility under 
extreme conditions.
7.3.2  Operating Stability
Just as a new pair of shoes needs to be “broken in” before they wear well, most 
semiconductors need to be exercised before deployment. This process, called 
stabilization or burn in, is discussed in Chapter 9. Essentially, the conducting 
junction or channel matures as current passes through it. Once a stable path is 
formed, the electrical performance will not change for the duration of the oper­
ating lifetime provided the conditions are unchanged (i.e., same or lower bias, 
RF drive level, or temperature).
Unfortunately, many system specifications require 100-hour stabilization 
at 100°C (legacy numbers from older military standards). For a GaAs compo­
nent, this generic process can be so severe that it degrades performance and 
consumes usable lifetime. Similarly for a GaN component, this process may 
drive up the cost of testing and have an insignificant effect (higher temperature 
may be needed). It is important to use military standards judiciously.
7.3.3  Environmental Considerations
Radars can be found everywhere from deep under water to deep space, so the 
range of possible environmental conditions is tremendously large. Systems (and 

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
213
therefore components) must operate regardless of the environment. Some of 
the more problematic environmental conditions are addressed as follows.
Temperature
The typical operating temperature range for a military system is –40 to +85°C, 
although some span –55 to +125°C. Since most electrical parameters degrade 
as temperature increases, performance is usually determined by the highest op­
erating temperature. Electrical stability (Kfactor from 4.20) is more difficult to 
achieve at low temperature, so analysis must be performed at the lowest tem­
perature. If cold models are not available, a simple analysis can be performed 
by adding a gain stage equivalent to 0.016 dB/°C per stage to account for the 
added gain at low temperature. For example, a two-stage amplifier will add ap­
proximately [0.016 dB/°C · (85 – –40°C) · 2 stages =] a 4-dB gain between hot 
and cold. It should be verified that the active components are still stable with 
the added gain (Section 4.2.1).
All materials should be checked to ensure that the operating temperature 
range is within its safe operating range. Keep in mind that active components 
dissipate heat, so the temperature a component experiences could be higher 
than the external temperature. Some materials, like polymers, become brittle at 
low temperature. Others, like solder, can reflow (become liquid) at high tem­
perature. There are also materials, like indium, that degrade with temperature 
cycling (a behavior called creep). Fortunately, material blends are usually avail­
able that provide extended temperature range.
An assortment of tests can be performed to evaluate temperature effects 
on a component, including the following:
• Thermal shock: A sample is cycled between submerging in hot liquid 
and submerging in cold liquid. The sudden change in temperature ac­
celerates the effects of thermal mismatch between materials.
• Thermal cycling: A sample is cycles between hot and cold air with a 
soak time (nominally 30 minutes) after each step. The gradual change in 
temperature accelerates the effects of thermal creep in the component.
Moisture
An enclosure that is hermetic is impervious to gas and is formed by seam-sealing 
or laser-welding two metals, ceramics, and/or glasses together. If gas particles 
cannot enter (or escape) then neither can moisture or particulates. The military 
(and industry) standard leak test requires filling a cavity with helium and then 
measuring for leaks. Helium is used because it is an inert gas and the second 
smallest element on Earth (after hydrogen). This is called a fine leak test, and 
MIL STD 883 specifies the amount of allowable leakage. Alternatively, a gross 
leak test requires dipping the sample in a clear liquid and watching for bubbles.

Practical Note
Most MMICs are covered by a protective insulating layer called a passivation layer. It is 
usually made from a thin layer (100–300 nm) of silicon nitride. Contrary to popular 
belief, MMICs that are properly passivated can operate with moisture on the surface. 
However, due to water’s dielectric constant of approximately 80 (it varies greatly with 
frequency), surface moisture can dramatically change the electrical performance. That 
is the real reason MMICs are usually enclosed in a hermetic package.
Surface moisture can also change the performance of substrates. As mois­
ture is absorbed into the material, the substrate is being loaded with a high-
dielectric material (again, approximately 80). This raises the effective dielectric 
of the material, which in turn changes the impedance of the transmission line. 
Fortunately, the effective dielectric constant is not the weighted average of the 
two individual permittivities. For example, a 25-mil-thick substrate that is half 
permittivity 2 and half permittivity 80 is not permittivity 41. It is actually ap­
proximately 4.2 (determined through full-wave analysis). This may seem coun­
terintuitive, but it is similar to combining 2-Ω and 80-Ω resistors in parallel. 
The result is approximately 1.95Ω; the effect of the 80-Ω resistor is almost 
negligible.
Some materials, like liquid crystal polymer, are hydrophobic and do 
not absorb moisture. Instead, moisture passes right through them like water 
through a sieve. These materials maintain electrical performance in high-mois­
ture environments.
Corrosion
Other than inert gasses, nearly every other substance is corrosive to electronics. 
Hydrogen causes damage to pHEMT devices. Salt mist and oxygen can break 
down metals. Even fine particulates can cause excessive scratching over time. 
Just as MMICs are coated in a protective passivation layer, other components 
can be coated in protective layers as well. Parylene and all of its variations are 
a popular option for radar components because of their low dielectric constant 
(< 3). It can be added with little thought as to the electrical ramifications.
Parylene can be easily deposited by vapor deposition or dipping in liquid 
so oddly shaped objects are not difficult to coat. It offers a corrosion barrier 
against strong acids and bases and can handle high temperature (> 300°C).
7.3.4  Electrical Considerations
We have already considered performance changes due to dielectric loading from 
moisture. Additionally, environmental effects can change the performance of 
the components connected to the input and output, which can alter the match­
ing condition. Generally this is only an issue for active components. Instead of 

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
215
providing a fixed system impedance (typically 50Ω), the component may be 
terminated with a changing impedance within an N:1 VSWR circle. For exam­
ple, a component may be required to operate within a 3:1 VSWR circle (return 
loss can be as bad as 6 dB over all phase angles). Some protection can be added 
by incorporating a small attenuator at the port, but this adds loss. Alternatively, 
a hybrid coupler can be incorporated as discussed in Section 4.3.2.
Components may need to be protected against DC or RF power spikes. 
This can be caused by system failure or electronic countermeasures targeting 
the radar. DC spikes can usually be mitigated by designing smoothing circuits 
into the DC supply or power-conditioning circuit. Short DC bursts are more 
difficult to handle, because the transient response (rise and fall time of the 
spike) can be similar to the RF operating frequency. Filtering the response to 
remove spikes is therefore not possible. Instead, high-breakdown materials, like 
GaN, can be used for added robustness. GaN operates at 28V or 50V, but the 
breakdown voltage is usually 150V or higher. Even when the peak voltage is on 
the drain, there is still ample margin in the event of a spike.
In applications where high-breakdown materials cannot be used, oversiz­
ing the device will increase the potential power handling. This will come at 
the expense of performance since the amplifier will not operate near saturated 
power.
7.3.5  Mechanical Considerations
Whether mounted on a warfighter, military vehicle, aircraft, or satellite, systems 
and components are going to be exposed to vibrations, acceleration, and vari­
ous forms of drop shock. For the most part, microelectronic circuits (and sub­
circuits) are so small and lightweight that these effects are negligible. Where it 
becomes an issue is at the system level, where many large components are being 
combined together and can flex. Also, the physical size can be sufficiently large 
to have a mechanical resonance.  If the vibration frequency matches the reso­
nant frequency, excessive wear or fracturing can occur. This can be avoided by 
performing a full structural analysis and testing for those physical conditions.
7.4  Designing for Pulsed Radar
Radars operate in either continuous wave (CW) or pulsed mode. This section 
discusses the impact of pulsed operation on component design.
7.4.1  Radar Terminology
In pulsed mode, a radar toggles between transmit and receive functionality as 
shown in Figure 7.8.

216 
Radar RF Circuit Design
The duration of the transmit cycle is also called the pulse width (τ). The 
periodicity of transmit pulses is called the pulse repetition interval (PRI). The 
reciprocal of PRI is the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The duty cycle is the 
fraction of time the radar is transmitting and is calculated by:
	
D
PRF
PRI
τ
τ
=

⋅
	
(7.2)
where D is the duty cycle (percentage), τ is the pulse width (s), PRI is the pulse 
repetition interval (s), and PRF is the pulse repetition frequency (Hz).
PRF is a very important factor in designing pulsed radar. If the PRF is 
too high (meaning that pulses occur too often), then the echo from one pulse 
reflecting from a far target may not be distinguishable from the echo coming 
from a later pulse on a closer target. This is known as range ambiguity. Similarly, 
if the PRF is too low the Nyquist condition for Doppler may not be met. This is 
known as Doppler frequency ambiguity [7]. Radar designers must find the right 
balance.
The average power for a pulsed radar can be calculated from:

where Pavg is the average power level (W) and Pt is the transmit power level (W).
From (7.3), it can be seen that to achieve the same level of average power, 
pulsed radar must use much higher peak power level.
Figure 7.8  Radar transmit and receive behavior in pulsed mode.

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
217
In modern radar systems, the transmit bandwidth of the radar signal can 
be greater than the reciprocal of the pulse width when utilizing spread spectrum 
techniques (referred to as pulse compression in radar parlance).
7.4.2  Component Design
Fortunately for components, operating in pulsed mode reduces the average DC 
and RF power level, which lowers the operating temperature. In fact, applica­
tions with very narrow pulse width and low duty cycle can completely mitigate 
the effects of temperature (known as an isothermal condition).
Practical Note
It is common to see a 0.5–1-dB increase in output power and a 1–2-dB increase in 
gain when an amplifier changes from CW to pulsed mode. Efficiency also increases as 
a result of the increased gain.
To operate in pulsed mode, there are three design factors to consider.
• Time and phase alignment: When combining signals in CW mode, 
phase alignment is important to minimize combining loss. In pulsed 
mode, if two signals are not time-aligned, they could miss each other en­
tirely. This is particularly important for narrow pulses. Full-wave simu­
lation (discussed in Section 7.5) can help ensure good time alignment.
• Stability: Amplifiers that are unstable at CW may be stable when pulsed. 
If the oscillation is caused by a feedback loop (discussed in Chapter 8), 
the pulse width could be shorter than the time required for the feedback 
to occur. Even if a component is intended to only operate pulsed, it is 
a good idea to verify CW stability, even if only using S-parameters. It is 
common to debug circuits using CW signals (even if only at low power) 
to make testing easier.
• RF blocking (choking): If the drain or gate voltage is being pulsed to 
conserve prime power, this can become an issue for the RF-blocking 
circuitry. In CW mode, the RF choke uses a series inductance and shunt 
capacitance to ground to pass DC and block RF. Inductors treat fast DC 
pulses the same way they do AC signals. This is shown in Figure 7.9. 
As the series inductance increases, the voltage pulse takes longer to turn 
on and off. This could degrade or potentially cripple a pulsed radar. A 
balance must be found that provides enough isolation between the com­
ponent and the pulsed voltage source without preventing the pulse from 
propagating through it.

218 
Radar RF Circuit Design
Whenever components are not operating (say, the LNA during transmit 
mode or the PA during receive mode), they are often biased down by pinching 
off the gate or applying 0V to the drain. This is known as blanking, and it pro­
tects the components and can reduce prime power. Component specifications 
will often include a blanking time, which indicates how quickly the component 
must turn on and/or off when triggered. Blanking is especially beneficial to class 
A amplifiers since they consume prime power even when no RF is applied.
7.5  Taking Advantage of Simulators
It’s hard to imagine how complex designs were ever done before the days of 
computers and simulators. Today, realizing “first-pass success” isn’t just a mar­
keting term; it is achievable when a simulator is used by someone who knows 
how to apply it properly.
In general, simulators can do the following:
• Determine small and large-signal performance (provided that suitable 
models are available);
• Optimize component values;
• Show how varying one (or more) parameter can affect performance;
• Perform sensitivity analysis (discussed in Chapter 8);
• Analyze components in multiphysics environments (i.e., electrical, ther­
mal, and mechanical);
Figure 7.9  Degradation of pulse as series inductance from RF choke increases.

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
219
• Generate initial designs based on traditional approaches.
In general, simulators cannot do the following:
• Invent new architectures;
• Trade off multiple approaches and materials;
• Find ways to make a design more compact;
• Determine what is manufacturable;
• Investigate cost-saving options.
A widely used RF simulator is Keysight ADS [8]. Simulation examples 
shown throughout this book and the remainder of this section were generated 
using ADS.
7.5.1  Passives
One nice feature of ADS is that it offers built-in designs that it calls Design­
Guides. Nearly every passive component imaginable has a dedicated Design­
Guide for both the lumped and distributed form. A designer can select the 
component needed from the drop-down menu, enter the key specifications 
(i.e., frequency, bandwidth, and ripple), and in seconds the design is done. 
The design may not meet all specifications, but it can almost always provide 
something close. Then, the designer can make tweaks and optimize from that 
starting point. The distributed and lumped-element band pass filters shown in 
Chapter 6 were designed using the ADS Filter DesignGuide.
In addition to DesignGuides, ADS also offers a utility called LineCalc 
that performs a similar function, but for more standard designs. As an example, 
an 8-finger 3-dB Lange coupler was designed using LineCalc that operates at 
X-band. Lange couplers are notoriously tricky to design, but ADS was able to 
generate the design shown in Figure 7.10 instantly.
Without changing the design, the layout in Figure 7.10 was simulated, 
and the results are shown in Figure 7.11. Return loss (S11) and isolation (S41) 
are better than 29 dB across X-band. The thru (S21) and coupled (S31) loss are 
within ±0.3 dB of each other.
Other than components, ADS can also be used to generate matching net­
works. Any two impedances can be entered, and ADS will provide a list of pos­
sible matching networks. It is certainly much faster than using a Smith chart.
7.5.2  Actives
Chapters 4 and 5 show that amplifier design is rooted in circles (i.e., power, 
gain, efficiency, stability, noise, and match). Fortunately, ADS can generate 

220 
Radar RF Circuit Design
those circles from a device model. There are even built-in DesignGuides that 
generate those circles automatically.
ADS has several useful features for analyzing stability. For looking at com­
ponent-level stability, ADS will calculate the four stability parameters discussed 
in Section 4.2.1 (Kfactor, Kmeasure, μload, and μsource). Additionally, ADS offers a 
two-port stability probe (SProbe) that can be placed on any node in a circuit to 
determine if it is unstable at that node. The probe is most accurate when placed 
directly on the gate and drain nodes. Sometimes losses between the transistor 
and the input/output ports can mask an instability. Adding an SProbe directly 
on the transistor prevents this from happening.
7.5.3  Full-Electromagnetic (EM) Simulation
Schematic simulators operate by building a block diagram of lumped elements, 
distributed elements, and other components. Figure 7.12 presents a schematic 
for a two-way Wilkinson divider. Each block has a behavioral model that the 
simulator uses to calculate the integrated performance. The “S-parameters” 
block lists the frequency range to simulate over. The “MSub” block includes 
information about the substrate (in this case 25-mil-thick alumina). Any cou­
pling that may occur between TL2 and TL3 would not be captured in this 
simulation.
To improve accuracy, the substrate components (i.e., the MLIN trans­
mission lines) can be simulated using full EM analysis (also called full-wave 
analysis). Full-EM simulators calculate the electric and magnetic fields deter­
mined by Maxwell’s equations [(1.8), (1.11), (1.13), and (1.16)] including all 
time-varying and frequency-dependent behaviors. Coupling between structures 
would be accurately captured. Keysight offers a design package called FEM 
Simulator that allows a user to draw a circuit in three dimensions, simulate the 
Figure 7.10  Autogenerated Lange coupler from ADS.

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
221
circuit, and view the waves propagating through the structure. For complicated, 
three-dimensional circuits this is an incredibly powerful tool.
For designers who need more fidelity than can be achieved with a be­
havioral model, but who do not need something as sophisticated as a three-
dimensional model, there is an intermediate option. These simulators are called 
2.5D, quasi-3D, or planar 3D. They run faster than full-EM simulators, but not 
as fast as behavioral simulators. For the circuit in Figure 7.12, a 2.5D simulator 
is ideal. Substrate losses and coupling between structures would be captured. 
A designer could watch the RF current flow through the transmission lines (if 
needed) to diagnose issues.

7.5.4  Manufacturing Assessment
If a component could be built exactly as modeled, then it would work as ex­
pected every time. Unfortunately, this is never the case. Even the best manufac­
turers have tolerances that must be accounted for. Substrates typically vary in 
thickness and permittivity by 10%. Milled mechanical parts are usually within 
a mil (25.4 μm) of specification. Surface-mount elements (i.e., resistors and 
capacitors) are rated between 1 and 20%, depending on price. The list goes on 
and on.
Every component has many elements that can vary, and the best way to 
simulate a wide range of possible outcomes is with a Monte Carlo analysis.  This 
design step is discussed fully in Chapter 8, but a list of tolerances to consider is 
presented as follows.
• Bond wire placement: Bonds will not always be placed in the middle of 
a bond pad, which can change inductance;
• Bond wire height: Bond wire height can be difficult to control and 
height variations will change the bond wire length and equivalent in­
ductance;
• Gaps due to cutting tolerance: In hybrid circuits, gaps will occur between 
substrates to allow for manufacturing tolerances. These gaps should be 
kept small to maintain a good ground connection, but they will vary;
• MMIC process variation: Foundries can usually provide Monte Carlo 
parameters based on data they have taken on the process variation;
• Line width: Line width variation will change the line impedance;
• Surface-mount element tolerances: Manufacturers of products such as 
COTS resistors and capacitors should provide a tolerance that varies 
with price;

Microwave Integrated Circuits 
223
• Substrate thickness: Substrate thickness variation will change the im­
pedance and electrical length of the transmission lines;
• Substrate permittivity: Substrate permittivity will change the impedance 
and electrical length of the transmission lines;
• Port VSWR mismatch: The ports may not always maintain the system 
impedance (usually 50Ω), leading to performance degradation and in­
stability;
• Temperature variation: The thermal model will have some tolerance, 
which can change performance;
• Bias voltage: Depending on the power supply, bias voltage can drift with 
time, which can change performance.
After a Monte Carlo analysis is completed, the range of potential com­
ponent performance will be determined. From this, a projected manufactur­
ing yield can also be determined (if 90% of all Monte Carlo cases meet the 
specification, then that is the manufacturing yield—assuming that all possible 
tolerances have been captured). It can also be determined whether any scenarios 
can lead to device instability.
Even if a design has an ample performance margin, it doesn’t take much 
unexpected parasitic inductance to shift the operating frequency out of speci­
fication. Using a simulator like ADS, a designer can perform a Monte Carlo 
analysis and if the variation (or yield) is not as expected, designers can deter­
mine the main contributors to the variation and possibly modify them to make 
them less sensitive.
7.6  Manufacturing Practices
Engineering companies are placing a much stronger emphasis on designing for 
production. This is a design practice where engineers are aware of manufactur­
ing and test limitations during the design phase. Designing with production 
in mind leads to faster time to market, lower production costs, and ultimately, 
more competitive bidding. With the radar market becoming so competitive, it 
is important to address manufacturing practices and how to implement good 
design strategies.
For efforts that are genuinely research-oriented (bleeding edge), designing 
for production can stifle creativity. These endeavors are usually several iterations 
away from production, and only a handful of prototypes will be made in the 
course of the project to prove feasibility. Parts can usually be handmade or the 
best parts can be cherry-picked from those available. In these cases, designing 
for best results rather than production is ideal. In all other cases, including early 

224 
Radar RF Circuit Design
stage, technology maturation, or alpha/beta phase efforts, designing blind to 
the limitations of production would be a mistake.
7.6.1  Manufacturing Essentials
The words manufacturing and production are interchangeable. Manufacturing 
is derived from the Latin words manu factus meaning made by hand. A range 
between 70 and 80% of the cost of product development and manufacturing 
is determined during the initial design phase [9]. Engineering goals should not 
be restricted to only achieving the best possible performance; they should also 
include goals to make products that are manufacturable (i.e., high-yield and 
low-cost). There are several things to consider:
• Performance requirements: If the specifications are so aggressive that 
only the top-performing components will be used, this will drive up 
cost;
• Manufacturing method: Low-volume components or anything built by 
hand will have a different manufacturing tolerance than high-volume or 
automated manufacturing;
• Operating lifetime: Some military platforms are designed to operate for 
decades (the B-52 bomber is famous for having a 60+ year service record 
and counting). Components must be selected that can survive under 
operating conditions for the life of the product;
• Frequency of routine maintenance: Sometimes components cannot be 
designed to survive under normal operating conditions over the expect­
ed lifetime. Normal “wear and tear” may be unavoidable, but compart­
mentalizing parts that need replacing will improve serviceability;
• Consequences of in-service failure: It’s an unfortunate truth that when 
military systems fail, warfighters may be placed in harm’s way. This must 
be considered when determining the margin that a component has over 
its specification;
• End-of-life disposal: An often overlooked item, choosing recyclable 
materials, is becoming more important as environmental awareness in­
creases;
• Cost and price: The cost is the financial requirement to produce the 
component, whereas the price is what the components sell for. Profit is 
equal to price minus cost. Since price is often market-driven, to increase 
profit, cost must be reduced by controlling manufacturing expenses.

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
225
These manufacturing considerations require engineers to think about the 
following:
• Durability: Ability to withstand wear, pressure, and damage;
• Reliability: Consistent behavior for the operational lifetime;
• Longevity: Ability to survive for a long period of time;
• Cost: Expense associated with raw materials and assembly;
• Environmental impact: How the creation, operation, and disposal ef­
fects the environment.
Practical Note
The last example (environmental impact) is often neglected, but it shouldn’t be. In 
2010, the United States discarded 3.41 million tons of aluminum. At 84¢ per pound, 
that’s $5.7 billion dollars in waste (or $18.52 per American). Fortunately, nearly 20% 
of that aluminum was recovered [10]. Designing with recyclability in mind should be 
part of the design process.
7.6.2  Engineering Practices for High Yield
The life cycle of a product includes concept, design, development, production, 
distribution, use, and disposal. Right from the beginning (the concept and de­
sign phases), the entire lifecycle should be considered. For example, changing 
materials late in the design cycle to lower cost or improve manufacturing may 
not be possible, since the new materials will need to be reanalyzed for mechani­
cal, thermal, and electrical changes.
Some tips for achieving high manufacturing yield are listed as follows.
• Buy from reputable suppliers and question the source of their raw ma­
terials. Trace amounts of lead, silicone, or other impurities can cause 
failures during operation.
•  Avoid ambiguity by placing alignment marks (such as triangles) to indi­
cate how a part should be centered. Although the placement of a MMIC, 
surface-mount element, or bond wire may be obvious to engineers, these 
factors are not always clear to manufacturing technicians.
• When possible, keep feature sizes large. For example, a 50-Ω line on 
10-mil substrate with permittivity 10 is 9.3-mil-wide. On 25-mil-thick 
substrate, the line width is 24 mils. If both substrate thicknesses are 
equally suitable for the application, use the thicker substrate since the 
wider line width is easier to manufacture.

226 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Be mindful of electrical and mechanical tolerances and use a Monte 
Carlo analysis to determine areas of sensitivity (discussed in Chapter 8).
• Whenever possible, use thicker and higher-permittivity material, since 
thinner and lower permittivity materials are more sensitive to substrate 
variation.
• Screen substrates to reduce component-to-component variation, espe­
cially when quantities are high. Most substrate materials have a ±10% 
tolerance on both thickness and permittivity. Upon request (and some­
times for a nominal fee), this tolerance can be tightened.
• Individually select or bin materials and elements based on desired per­
formance. For example, use only components within 1% of nominal 
(referred to as the family group) or with peak performance. When com­
bining multiple parts (i.e., two amplifiers power-combined), top-per­
forming components can be paired with bottom-performing compo­
nents to achieve average performance.
• Having optional tuning structures on-MMIC or on-board; when units 
fall short on performance, these tuning structures can help resurrect a 
component from the scrap bin. Figure 7.13 shows four common tuning 
structures: The first image is of a transmission line or DC bias line with 
grounded traces on either side to support the addition of surface-mount 
capacitors for tuning or decoupling. The second image is of an open stub 
with pads that can be connected with wire bonds to extend the electrical 
length. The third image shows a tuning element called a trombone (due 
to its resemblance of a trombone slide) that can be wired bonded to ex­
tend the phase length. The inner connection must also be scratched off. 
The final image is of a pad field that can be wire-bonded to implement 
whatever electrical length is needed. In Figure 7.13, maximum phase 
length has been achieved by wire bonding every pad. Shorter phase de­
lays can be implemented by bonding fewer pads.

and pad field.

7.6.3  Designing for MMIC-Level Cost Reduction
If a component includes a MMIC, the MMIC is usually the most expensive 
part of the component. Foundries are inherently expensive to run and main­
tain. The material expense is also high, particularly when silicon carbide wafers 
are used (as is usually the case for GaN).
Unfortunately, the only method a designer has to reduce the MMIC cost 
is to make the size as small as possible. Since the foundry price is fixed, the 
more MMICs that can fit on a wafer, the lower the per-component cost will be. 
Designing for compact size is just a matter of making components small and as 
tightly packed as possible without compromising isolation.
Unlike modules that can be reworked when there are material or assembly 
issues, once a MMIC completes fabrication it cannot be modified. From fabri­
cation to product shipment, there are a number of stages where MMIC failure 
affects overall product yield; they are described as follows.
• Wafer yield (Yw): Percentage of wafers that complete processing (some­
times wafers are broken during processing due to mishandling or equip­
ment failure).
• Process visual yield (Ypv): Percentage of MMICs that pass visual inspec­
tion. [Sometimes foreign object debris (FOD) is introduced during 
fabrication. Since FOD is localized, fewer MMICs are affected when 
MMIC size is small.]
• Process electrical yield (Ype): Percentage of MMICs that pass electrical 
screening [usually defined by structures called process control monitors 
(PCMs) that must perform within a tightly controlled window]).
• Screening yield (Ys ): Percentage of MMICs within an acceptable perfor­
mance window (parts that do not perform “in family” may be suitable 
for engineering samples but cannot be used in production).
• Assembly yield (Ya): Percentage of MMICs that are successfully incor­
porated into the next higher-level assembly. (Sometimes components are 
damaged during assembly, especially while a process is being matured.)
• Burn-in yield (Ybi): Percentage of MMICs that meet performance re­
quirements after burn-in. (As discussed in Chapter 9, some components 
will not stabilize and therefore cannot be used.)
The final product yield (Y  ) is equivalent to the product of these quantities:

Radar RF Circuit Design
Yield values vary greatly depending on the MMIC size, foundry, process 
maturity, and manufacturer. In general, wafer yield, process visual yield, and 
process electrical yield usually total 85–95% yield. After screening yield, this 
drops to 80–90%. Assembly and burn-in yield can drop overall yield to 50% at 
first, but once the process is matured (especially when volumes are high), yield 
usually rebounds to 75–90%.
7.6.4  Designing for Module-Level Cost Reduction
The need for cost reduction is self-evident, but how to do it effectively is not. 
Some tips for designing for cost reduction follow:
• Don’t overdesign: A material and design strategy that greatly exceeds 
what is needed, it is also likely to be unnecessarily expensive. Seek out 
an alternative.
• Choose materials that are standard products, industry standard, or pro­
duced in large quantities: Competition and volume will drive down the 
price
• Use standard sizes: For example, if an 18-mil-thick MMIC carrier shim 
is the ideal size, but 20-mil-thick material is a standard product, try to 
use the 20-mil material.
• Monitor market price fluctuations: This is particularly true in the mi­
crowave industry since the price of precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, and 
copper) changes dramatically. For example, if the price of gold is high, 
avoid overplating substrate boards. Determine if a flash-plating process, 
which uses less gold, is thick enough for the application.
• Involve manufacturers early in design process: Some manufactures favor 
one technique or material over another due to equipment availability 
or personnel expertise. For example, it may be less expensive to replace 
a ribbon bond with multiple wire bonds. Knowing the strengths and 
weakness of manufacturers allows designers to make informed decisions.
• Push back on cost-driving requirements: Sometimes specifications are 
imposed that are “nice-to-haves” by the system designers but that drive 
up cost to the component designer. For example, if the higher-level as­
sembly is going to be hermetically sealed, then the individual compo­
nents probably do not need to be. An expensive hermetic package may 
be replaceable with an inexpensive plastic package.
• Push back on test requirements: The list of standard military tests cov­
ers hundreds of pages (discussed in Section 7.3). Testing and qualifica­
tion is not an inexpensive process, and sometimes a duplicate test is 

 
Microwave Integrated Circuits 
229
requested at the component and higher-assembly levels. For example, it 
may be unnecessary to do a drop-shock test at the component level if it 
is planned at the system level.
• Procure long lead parts in advance: Paying above market price to expe­
dite shipment drives up costs unnecessarily.
Practical Note
Premium capacitors that are used in radar systems are often made to order and have a 
12–16-week lead time. Even the best RF capacitors only cost a few cents each. (In fact, 
garden-variety parts cost a fraction of a penny each.) Rather than wait until a design 
is finalized, it is often less expensive to purchase several values upfront than pay to 
expedite delivery or hold production by several months.

Transmit/Receive Module Integration
Chapter 7 presented techniques for ensuring that components work as ex­
pected, that they are packaged properly, that they function under necessary 
operating conditions, and that they are manufacturable. In a perfect world, all 
components could be integrated together in “plug and play” fashion without 
issues. Unfortunately with RF systems, it’s not that simple. The effects of con­
necting components with mismatched impedances have already been discussed, 
but that’s only the beginning.
When integrating components, all electrical, mechanical, and thermal in­
teractions must be considered. Excess heat generated in one component, for 
example, can change the behavior of the entire module. If all components are 
not properly grounded or shielded, noise and oscillations are prone to domi­
nate performance. The risk of this happening is exacerbated whenever digital 
circuitry is added to the mix. All of these factors must be considered along with 
the variation expected from manufacturing tolerances.
All RF components radiate energy in one form or another. Unless pre­
ventative measures are taken, this energy can couple onto other components 
and affect their performance. Loss can increase, output power and linearity can 
degrade, and in some cases, components can be permanently damaged. Fortu­
nately, through the good integration practices discussed in this chapter, these 
issues can be prevented.
8.1  Integration Techniques
The word module is not a universally well-defined term, which can lead to 
confusion. One engineer’s module is another engineer’s subsystem, higher-level 
assembly, component, or RF enclosure, to name a few. Essentially, a module is 

232 
Radar RF Circuit Design
any RF assembly that includes a substrate contained within a housing with at 
least one external connector.
Alumina is a widely used RF substrate because it offers low loss and good 
thermal conductivity. It is also durable and easy-to-use. Alternatively, there are 
many composite materials available with a wide range of electrical and mechan­
ical properties. Most composites are either hydrocarbon, glass-filled polytetra­
fluoroethylene (PTFE), or ceramic-filled PTFE [1].
Housings are usually made of aluminum (for low weight and cost) or an 
iron-nickel-cobalt alloy (i.e., Kovar™) to minimize thermal expansion. Brass 
alloys (principally copper and zinc for wear and harsh environment resistance) 
and bronze (principally copper and tin for metal fatigue and harsh environment 
resistance) are also used. Brass has the advantage of being easier to machine than 
bronze.
RF connectors are available to accommodate a wide range of frequencies, 
sizes, and power-handling requirements. Chapter 9 discusses connectors. This 
section presents techniques for integrating components to create a module.
8.1.1  Physical Transitions
Section 2.2.1 discusses the effects of impedance mismatch. Essentially, the pow­
er that enters a component is related to the incident power and the reflection 
coefficient according to:
	
(
)
2
1
in
inc
P
P
=
- Γ
	
(8.1)
where Pin is the power entering the component (W), Γ is the reflection coef­
ficient, and Pinc is the incident power (W).
Improving transitions from component to component starts by minimiz­
ing this reflection coefficient. This can be done by selecting components that 
are well-matched at their ports (usually to 50Ω) or by designing an impedance-
matching circuit (discussed in Chapter 2).
Transitioning between different types of transmission lines can also be a 
source of loss. The most common transition is between CPW and microstrip. 
CPW is a popular choice because it allows for topside RF probing and has no 
dispersion, as shown in Figure 8.1. Microstrip has the advantage of smaller size 
since the ground plane is on the backside. Other differences are discussed in 
Chapter 2.
To connect these structures, the ground plane can be flared as shown 
in Figure 8.2. This softens the discontinuity and reduces parasitic effects. The 
structure is symmetric so it can be used as a microstrip to CPW transition as 
well.

There are several connector options for bringing DC into a module (dis­
cussed in Chapter 9). DC feedthroughs are available that incorporate a shunt 
capacitor. When screwed into a metal housing, the feedthrough provides a

capacitance to ground. This filters the DC input before entering the module. 
These are known as feedthrough capacitors, and they are commercially available 
well into millimeter-wave frequencies.
8.1.2  Wire and Ribbon Bonding
When components are integrated that do not have package leads (like those 
shown in Figure 7.6), wires or ribbons are used to connect the topside metal 
pads. Wires are usually 1 or 2 mils in diameter and ribbons are 5–10 mils in 
width. Chapter 3 provides (3.6), (3.7), and (3.8) for determining the equivalent 
inductance of a wire. Multiple wires can be used in parallel to handle the cur­
rent level and reduce inductance. A single ribbon can be used to replace several 
parallel wires. For brevity, this text will refer to all metal bonding structures as 
“wires.”
When connecting two transmission lines of unequal width, wires should 
always be placed such that they flare outward as shown in Figure 8.3. This will 
ease the step discontinuity to reduce loss and parasitic effects.
Bond wires must have some height in order to provide strain relief. When 
the temperature is cold, these small metal structures will shrink and break if 
adequate slack is not provided. However, if they are too long, the added induc­
tance will affect performance. Balance must be achieved.
Alternatively, if bond wires can be placed consistently from unit to unit, 
then the inductance can be compensated using either a series capacitor or set 
of transmission lines. For example, at 5 GHz, a 1-pF series capacitor can com­
pensate for a 1-nH wire bond. The same can be accomplished with a 50-Ω, 
36-degree transmission line in series with a 68-Ω, 90-degree transmission line.
8.1.3  Proper Grounding
All too often, grounding concerns at the module level are overlooked. Compo­
nents are attached to a common conductive surface (i.e., the metal housing),

width: orthogonal view (left) and top view (right).

and the ground plane is presumed to be equipotential everywhere. This is rarely 
the case. For current to flow, there must be a closed loop. A ground plane pro­
vides a low-resistance path for current to return to the source [2]. Since current-
carrying conductors experience a voltage drop, it is expected that the voltage 
potential will vary across the surface of a ground plane. Although the potential 
may be small, in a noisy system it will not be negligible. For example, small 
fluctuations in the gate voltage of an amplifier can be detected at the output, 
especially for high-gain amplifiers.
The worst type of ground architecture is known as common ground where 
all components connect to the ground plane at a single point. Instead, the path 
to ground from a component should be as physically short (ideally less than 
λ/20) and as low-inductance as possible. A distributed or multipoint ground 
architecture is particularly important at high frequency. Figure 8.4 shows com­
mon and distributed ground designs.
In modules that integrate digital, analog, and RF, each of those circuits 
should have its own ground plane to prevent noise coupling. Extremely noisy 
circuits, like relays or motors, must share a separate ground plane. RF chokes 
should be added to provide isolation between circuits and ground planes.

8.1.4  Achieving Compact Size
Size reduction is nearly always a design requirement. When integrating mul­
tiple components together into a module it is important to be mindful of two 
things, described as follows:
• Coupling between components: If components are placed too closely 
together, their fields will couple and isolation will be reduced. Figure 8.5 
shows the isolation between parallel 35-degree-long microstrip lines as 
separation increases (in terms of substrate thickness).
  To achieve 20-dB isolation, separation must be at least four substrate 
thicknesses wide. A common rule of thumb is to always maintain at 
least three to five substrate thicknesses between components. Alterna­
tively, components can be placed perpendicular to each other. Figure 8.6 
shows the isolation between the same microstrip lines from Figure 8.5, 
but placed perpendicular to each other. The isolation of one substrate

increases.

increases.

 
Transmit/Receive Module Integration 
237
thickness placed perpendicularly is the same as 5.5 substrate thicknesses 
placed in parallel.
• Cavity resonances: All enclosed metal structures have a cavity resonance. 
This is the frequency where waveguide effects start to occur. These fre­
quencies can be calculated from (2.82) in Section 2.3.6 or simulated 
using a 3D simulator. The lowest resonance of a module can be approxi­
mated by [2]:
	
,min
212
rf
l
=
	
(8.2)
where f is the resonant frequency (MHz), and l is the largest dimension 
(m). 
  For example, at 10 GHz, a module should be no more than 2.12-cm-
long. If it must be, then the inside of the module should be compart­
mentalized with conductive walls to reduce the cavity length.
8.1.5  Component Placement
Placing components near a discontinuity can increase the parasitic effects. Fig­
ure 8.7 provides an example of this. In Figure 8.7, a series element (in this 
case a capacitor) is placed near a mitered microstrip 90-degree corner. As that 
element is moved away from the miter without changing the physical length 
of the transmission line (left image in Figure 8.7), the insertion loss changes 
dramatically (right image in Figure 8.7).  The miter discontinuity provides an 
inductance that resonates with the series element (in this case, as an LC circuit). 
When electrical distance is placed between those reactive components, the reso­
nance (near 20 GHz in Figure 8.7) is alleviated.

mitered corner (left) and the S21 trend as the element moves (right).

Radar RF Circuit Design
8.2  Preventing Oscillation
One of the most frustrating issues to overcome when designing or integrating 
active components is oscillation (unless, of course, you are designing an oscil­
lator). Any active circuit has the potential to oscillate. This potential increases 
as gain increases. This section discusses various types, sources, and corrective 
actions for oscillation.
8.2.1  Even-Mode Oscillation 
Even-mode oscillation can happen whenever the transistor in an amplifier is not 
unconditionally stable. It is caused by signals at the output coupling or feeding 
back to the input. It can happen without any RF applied, and the frequency 
is usually below the operating band. Even-mode oscillation can be determined 
using stability analysis (discussed in Section 4.2.1) at each stage in the ampli­
fier chain (as opposed to analyzing the overall input and output module ports).
These oscillations are often fixed by changing DC bias capacitance or 
resistance values (or adding resistance to the gate bias). It is important that bias 
circuitry is included in stability analysis for this reason.
8.2.2  Odd-Mode Oscillation
Odd-mode oscillation can happen when multiple transistors or amplifiers are 
combined asymmetrically. This can occur if transistors have different electrical 
behavior (i.e., different IDSS, pinch-off voltage, or transconductance). It can 
occur in amplifiers if matching conditions are different due to tolerances or 
unequal coupling to other components. It generally happens under RF drive, 
and the frequency is usually in or above the operating band. Behavior usually 
changes with bias or input power level.
These oscillations are often avoided by tightly matching transistor or am­
plifier performance. They can be fixed by adding resistors between amplifier 
gates or drains to improve isolation. Unfortunately, this will reduce gain, output 
power, and efficiency.
8.2.3  Spurious Oscillation
Spurious oscillation is a catch-all term for any frequency that appears at the 
output that is not a harmonic, mixing product, or cavity resonance. The origins 
are often unknown and cannot be predicted from stability analysis. They can 
happen in or out of the operating frequency range. Sometimes the oscillations 
disappear at certain biases or temperatures.
These are difficult to fix, especially in broadband circuits. Usually they are 
resolved through trial and error on the measurement bench. Moving absorbing 

 
Transmit/Receive Module Integration 
239
material or metal shims (i.e., aluminum foil) around the module can sometimes 
reveal a way to dampen the oscillation. Adding an LC circuit to ground from 
the DC bias can sometimes help alleviate a spurious oscillation.
If digital circuits are within the module, noise generated from those com­
ponents can contribute directly or indirectly (through harmonics or mixing) to 
oscillations. Section 8.7 discusses this phenomenon.
8.2.4  Ground Loops
Ground loops can occur whenever there is a disconnect in the ground plane. 
As mentioned in Section 8.1.3, the voltage across a ground plane may not be 
equipotential. By Faraday’s law of induction, this can induce a current (called 
ground-loop current). This is shown in Figure 8.8.
When the shield of a coax is connected to the grounded source of an am­
plifier (left image of Figure 8.8), that ground node can have a different voltage 
potential than the voltage input. This causes a ground loop. If the shield is con­
nected directly to the ground plane (right image of Figure 8.8), there is a better 
chance of achieving an equipotential ground.
Ground loops can also be avoided by [3] doing the following:
• Ensuring that all paths to ground are low-inductance (i.e., larger diam­
eter vias have lower inductance than narrow diameter vias);
• Ensuring that all paths to ground are low-resistance (i.e, filling with 
high-conductivity metals);
• Using a multipoint ground design and as many ground paths as can be 
practically implemented.
8.3  Preventing Crosstalk and Leakage
All circuit elements radiate whenever charge is moving. Electric (or capacitive) 
coupling occurs whenever electric fields from two or more components inter­

corrected circuit to prevent ground loop (right).

240 
Radar RF Circuit Design
act. This is often mistakenly referred to as electrostatic coupling, but fields of 
this type are never static. Magnetic (or inductive) coupling occurs whenever 
magnetic fields from two or more components interact. This is commonly mis­
labeled as electromagnetic coupling, even though there is no influence from an 
electric field. Whenever both electric and magnetic fields are interacting be­
tween components, it is appropriate to classify the situation as electromagnetic.
If the distance between components is less than λ/2π, the fields are within 
the near-field region, and the effects of electrical and magnetic fields must be 
handled separately. If the distance between components is greater than λ/2π, 
the fields are within the far-field region, and the effects of electrical and mag­
netic fields can be handled as a single electromagnetic field.
The ratio of the electric field (E

) to the magnetic field (B

) is the wave im­
pedance. In the far field, the E B

 ratio is equal to the characteristic impedance 
(Zo) of the propagating medium, which can be calculated from:

where f is the frequency (Hz), μ is the permeability (H/m), σ is the conductiv­

j2πf ε and the previous equation reduces to:

(8.4)
The far-field free-space wave impedance is 120πΩ (approximately 377Ω). 
Notice that this quantity is independent of frequency.
In the near field, the E B

 ratio is dependent upon the nature of the 
source and the distance to the source. If the source is predominantly magnetic, 
the source will have high current and low voltage, and E B

 will be less than 
377Ω. If the source is predominantly electric, the source will have low current 
and high voltage, and E B

 will be greater than 377Ω.
Additionally in the near field, the electric field attenuates at a rate of 
(1/d )3 and the magnetic field attenuates at a rate of (1/d )2, where d is the 
distance from the source. The wave impedance increases as d increases and ap­
proaches 377Ω when d is λ/2π (the start of the far-field region). In the far field, 
both electric and magnetic fields attenuate at a rate of 1/d [2].
Conceptually, crosstalk and leakage can be reduced by the following [2]:
• Reducing the source of the noise;

 
Transmit/Receive Module Integration 
241
• Reducing the conducting or coupling channel;
• Desensitizing the receptor.
Generally this can be accomplished by either shielding, properly ground­
ing, filtering, separating components, or reorienting components. All of these 
techniques are discussed in this chapter.
8.3.1  Electric Coupling
If we assume that a component can be approximated as a perfect conductor 
with regard to radiation, then electric coupling analysis is much more straight­
forward. Between any two components, the voltage that couples from compo­
nent 1 to component 2 can be calculated from [2]:

where VC is the voltage coupled to component 2 (V), V1 is the voltage on 
component 1 (V), f is the frequency of V1 (Hz), C12 is the capacitance between 
component 1 and component 2 (F), C2G is the capacitance between component 
2 and ground (F), and R2G is the resistance between component 2 and ground 
(W). V1 can be the desired signal or an undesired noise voltage.
The capacitance between two parallel conductors (which we are approxi­
mating our components to be) can be calculated by [2]:

the distance between components (m), and d is the diameter of the component

Equation (8.7) indicates that the coupled voltage is proportional to the 
source voltage, frequency, the resistance of component 2 to ground, and the ca­
pacitance between components. Since the source voltage and frequency usually 
cannot be changed, the only ways to reduce coupling are to improve (reduce 
the resistance) the connection from component 2 to ground or to decrease the 
capacitance between components. The latter can be accomplished by doing the 
following:
• Reorienting the components (i.e., perpendicular or off-angle instead of 
parallel);
• Adding shielding (discussed in Section 8.3.3);
• Increasing distance between components (8.6).
In the case where R2G is much larger than [j2πf (C12 + C2G)]–1, the VC 
equation can be simplified to [2]:

Three observations about the coupling voltage can be made from (8.8):
• It is independent of frequency;
• The magnitude is larger than when R2G is small;
• It is a function of the capacitance between conductor 2 and ground.
8.3.2  Magnetic Coupling
We know from the Ampère-Maxwell law (1.16) that an electric current pro­
duces a circulating magnetic field. This magnetic field can couple from one 
object to another. If a current flow in component 1 induces a magnetic flux in 
component 2, a mutual inductance between the components can be calculated 
from [2]:

(8.9)
where M12 is the mutual inductance, φ12 is the flux in component 2 due to

to the electric capacitance C12.

where μ is the permeability of the volume between components (μ = μ o = 4π × 
10–7 H/m for free space), I is the current in component 1, and r is the distance 
between components (meters).
Equations (8.11) and (8.12) indicate that the coupled voltage is pro­
portional to the source current, frequency, flux density, and inductance be­
tween components. Since the source current and frequency usually cannot be 
changed, the only ways to reduce coupling are to reduce the flux density or 
decrease the inductance between components. This can be accomplished by 
doing the following:
• Reorienting the components (i.e., perpendicular or off-angle instead of 
parallel) to change θ;

244 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• If the source of the current is a wire, coiling (or twisting) the wire to 
cancel the magnetic field and reduce B;
• Increasing distance between components to decrease M12.
Air core or open magnetic core inductors are prone to magnetic coupling 
since their flux extends well outside the volume of the component. Particular 
attention should be paid to either shield these components or space them away 
from other components. Alternatively, closed magnetic core inductors can be 
used.
8.3.3  Shielding
Shielding introduces an electrically conductive partition that surrounds a vol­
ume to provide isolation to the outside. When placed around a noise or cou­
pling source, they are effective at containing (or blocking) electromagnetic 
fields. When the shield is grounded, the coupled voltage is shorted to ground 
and the component within the shield is isolated. A proper shield should be 
grounded at a distance no less than every λ/20.
In high-gain power amplifiers, it is critically important to ground the 
shield properly. Otherwise, coupling between the final-stage output and the 
shield can cause a feedback loop to couple between the first-stage input and the 
shield. This can be prevented by grounding the shield to the amplifier common 
terminal (usually the source since most RF amplifiers use a common-source 
configuration). In most cases, the amplifier common terminal is directly con­
nected to the ground plane so that the shield can also be connected directly to 
the ground plane. In cases where the amplifier has an isolated ground (i.e., a 
floating ground to prevent noise coupling to a sensitive receiver circuit), the 
shield should connect to the amplifier ground and remain isolated from the 
system ground (or Earth ground).
Shielding can be effective for magnetic coupling, but it’s not as straight­
forward as preventing electric coupling. Magnetic shielding functions by induc­
ing a ground-return current in the direction opposite to the main propagating 
signal. The two currents generate magnetic fields in directions opposite to each 
other, which effectively cancels them out. The difficulty in implementing this 
approach is getting the ground locations on the shield correct. If the opposing 
magnetic field is not equal, opposite, and in alignment with the main magnetic 
field, the shield will be ineffective (or will only be effective over a small range of 
frequencies). Using a coaxial cable (discussed in Chapter 9) can provide a well-
controlled environment for implemented a high-frequency magnetic shield as 
long as both ends of the coax are grounded to implement the ground-return 
loop. At low frequency, coaxial cables are ineffective at magnetic shielding. A

twisted-pair cable is much more effective, and the number of twists per unit 
length should be maximized for peak effectiveness. 
Instead of shielding the receiving component, placing a well-grounded 
shield over the radiating component can also be effective. Regardless of the 
shield location, it can only truly be effective if there are no gaps, holes, or breaks 
in the shield.
The effectiveness of a shield can be determined by adding the absorbed 
loss in the shield with the loss from reflection. At low frequency for electric 
fields, reflection loss dominates, and at high frequency absorption loss domi­
nates. Absorption loss dominates magnetic fields at all frequencies.
The absorption loss of a shield depends on the thickness and skin depth 
and can be calculated by [2]:

where A is the absorption loss (dB), t is the thickness of the shield (m) and δs is 
the skin depth (m) (2.87). Absorption loss is the same whether in the near field, 
far field, electric field, or magnetic field.
The reflection loss can be calculated from [2] assuming that:

(8.15)
where R is the reflection loss (dB), f is the frequency (Hz), μ is the shield mate­
rial permeability (H/m), and σ is the shield material conductivity (S/m). From 
the perspective of preventing coupling to the outside, higher reflection loss is 
better than lower reflection loss—although it is true that too much reflection 
can couple back to the circuit and change performance.
The alternative to using a shield material with good conductivity is to 
use one with high permeability (that is, a magnetic or ferrite-loaded material). 
Since skin depth is inversely proportional to permeability, increasing μ also 
increases absorption loss. This makes the shield more effective, particularly at 
low frequency. Concurrently, reflection loss is inversely proportional to perme­
ability, so increasing μ reflects less energy, which may be beneficial for some 
sensitive components that cannot tolerate reflections.
Unfortunately, magnetic shielding is not as effective for low-frequency 
electric fields. As a compromise, the inside of a conductive shield can be lined 
with high-permeability material. This stack-up is more costly than using one of 
the other methods, but it does offer broader-band shielding.

Radar RF Circuit Design
The best shield completely covers the component being shielded, but un­
fortunately that is not always possible. Openings may need to be added to feed 
in bias lines, RF lines, or cooling structures. These openings should be used 
minimally. Some guidelines for minimizing the effect of shield openings in­
clude the following [2]:
• Multiple small openings are better than one large hole of the same area;
• Keep the openings to less than λ/20 each;
• Space openings by more than λ/2;
• Distribute openings to different sides of the module.
8.4  Thermal Considerations
When integrating multiple components, it is important to determine the 
change in temperature due to the surrounding components. Section 4.5.1 dis­
cussed the equations for performing thermal analysis, although thermal analy­
sis is usually determined through simulation. Components that generate large 
amounts of heat (i.e., high-power amplifiers) may need to be placed away from 
temperature-sensitive components (i.e., LNAs).
Generally, it is desirable to pull heat away from the sources (i.e., transis­
tors) as quickly as possible to prevent overheating, loss of performance, and 
reduced lifetime. Reducing the thermal resistance to the heat sink can be ac­
complished using the following:
• High thermal conductivity ceramics and semiconductors: The appendix 
lists the thermal conductivities of many common materials, including 
aluminum nitride (285 W/m·K) and silicon carbide (114 W/m·K);
• High thermal conductivity metal carriers: The appendix lists the ther­
mal conductivities of many common materials, including aluminum 
(235 W/m·K) and copper (401 W/m·K);
• CVD diamond: A relatively new addition to the microwave market, 
CVD diamond has thermal conductivity up to 1,800 W/m·K. Due to 
the high price, it is usually placed only under the hottest components to 
effectively remove heat from the source;
• Thermally conductive pastes, gels, greases, and films: These materials 
are thinly spread between the main conducting materials (i.e., substrate 
and housing) to fill in any air gaps (air is nearly 9,000 times less conduc­
tive than aluminum).

 
Transmit/Receive Module Integration 
247
It is also desirable to spread the heat around the module surface and elimi­
nate it from the module as much as possible. There are several ways to do this, 
described as follows.
• Heat pipes: As the name suggests, these are tubes filled with a material 
that is superconducting in one direction (in this case, down the pipe). 
They can be placed parallel or perpendicular to the heat source(s) and 
act like a thermally conductive superhighway to move heat from the 
source to the sink. These are particularly useful in applications where the 
heat sink is located far from the heat source.
• Phase change materials: Substances added to the module that are de­
signed to melt at the upper temperature limit. When that temperature 
is exceeded, the substance changes phases (i.e., melts or evaporates) and 
absorbs heat in the process. This process cools the module. Materials are 
available that can be effective to more than 150°C.
• Convection cooling: Forcing fluid (i.e., air, deionized water, or glycol) 
over a module can increase the rate of heat removal by 10 times (dis­
cussed in Section 4.5.1).
8.5  Mechanical Considerations
When components (especially hybrid circuits) are integrated, it is important to 
pay attention to the type of metal used in the carrier. Whenever two different 
metals touch, there is a risk of galvanic action taking place. This is especially 
true in the presence of moisture or water vapor. Table 8.1 lists common metals 
used in RF modules from most anodic to most cathodic.
The further away from each other the metals reside in Table 8.1, the great­
er the galvanic reaction between them (i.e., the greater the voltage generated). 
Whenever possible, only materials within the same group should be used to­
gether. Otherwise, one or both metals will corrode and eventually the module 
will cease to function.
Practical Note
Attaching copper (group 4) to aluminum (group 2) is popular because it combines 
the thermal spreading of copper with the low cost and light weight of aluminum. 
Together, they generate a serious galvanic reaction. and eventually the aluminum will 
corrode away. This reaction can be slowed if the copper is coated with lead-tin solder 
(group 3) since the galvanic reaction between aluminum and lead-tin is much less [2].

248 
Radar RF Circuit Design
8.6  Module Simulation and Monte Carlo Analysis
Simulating at the module level can be cumbersome. Each component is prob­
ably simulated by a different designer, and integrating multiple design files to­
gether can be nontrivial. Additionally, components that are purchased commer­
cially may not have behavioral models. Despite these challenges, the likelihood 
of achieving first-pass success is significantly higher when higher-level assembly 
simulations are performed.
Keysight ADS is equally effective at simulating modules as it is at simulat­
ing components. Each design file can be represented as a single component with 
multiple ports for DC and RF input and output. Alternatively, a measurement 
file can be used when a model is not available. Multiple design or measurement 
components can be combined to create higher-level components, and this pro­
cess can be repeated until the entire module can be represented in a manageable 
form. Once this main simulation file is created, module-level performance can 
be simulated and compared against the specification. Sources of losses can be 
determined. Stability and crosstalk analysis can also be performed.

The one limitation of this “master” simulation file is that it assumes that 
all mechanical dimensions, assembly alignment, and device performance are 
perfect. In reality, we know this is not possible. Machine and circuit board 
shops and assembly houses typically hold tolerances to within a few mils. De­
vices generally fall within ±10% of the nominal value. A small unexpected and 
undesired parasitic can have a significant impact on performance. Tables 8.2 
and 8.3 list the reactance (imaginary part of impedance) created by an unde­
sired series inductance and capacitance at 5, 20, and 50 GHz.
Tables 8.2 and 8.3 show that it doesn’t take much to create a large reac­
tance, and this causes two concerns:
• How does this variation affect performance?
• How does this variation affect stability?
Arguably, the second concern is the most important. A design can have 
ample margin over the specification, but that doesn’t matter if the component 
fails under RF drive due to instability.
To determine how much variation can be expected due to tolerances, a 
Monte Carlo analysis can be performed. Simulators allow a designer to set a

nominal value, range of possible values, and type of variation (usually uniform 
or Gaussian) for each physical variable (i.e., length, width, thickness, and place­
ment). The simulator will vary the parameters pseudorandomly equally across 
the range specified (if the variation type is set to uniform) or weighted more 
heavily around the nominal (if the variation type is set to Gaussian). Each set of 
parameters simulated is called a trial. A good rule of thumb for thorough cover­
age is to determine the minimum number of trials per:

where Ntrials is the number of Monte Carlo trials, Nparam is the number of pa­
rameters varied, and e is the natural log (≈2.718). Figure 8.9 plots this equation.
As the number of parameters gets large, the suggested number of trials 
can reach tens or hundreds of thousands. It may be necessary to perform a 
full Monte Carlo analysis on each component, determine the range of possible 
performance, create a new behavioral model that is hard-coded to this range 
of possible performance (ADS has built-in behavioral models for components 
that makes this straightforward), and use that simplified component in the 
module-level Monte Carlo analysis. For example, a power amplifier may have 
35 variables, so it needs to run approximately 16,000 trials. From that analysis, 
a range of output power, efficiency, linearity, noise, and S-parameters will be de­
termined. Those ranges can be entered into the ADS “Amplifier2” component. 
Now there are only eight or so variables that are needed to provide the same 
behavior variation in the next higher-level analysis.
Figure 8.10 shows the results of an example Monte Carlo analysis for 
a two-way Wilkinson divider. The case where all variables are as designed is

eters (8.16).

labeled the nominal. Notice the spread of performance that can be expected due 
to electrical, mechanical, and assembly tolerances.
8.7  Incorporating Digital into an RF Module
As digital circuits become smaller, more powerful, easier to program, and less 
power consuming, incorporating them into RF modules has become more pop­
ular and for good reason. ADCs sample an RF waveform and convert it to a 
digital signal. Once in the digital domain, software can be written to perform 
math or logic functions on the data. Complicated functions are usually much 
easier to implement in the digital rather than analog domain. DACs generate 
an RF waveform from the digital signal.
A digital integrated circuit that can be programmed (and reprogrammed) 
by the designer is called a field programmable gate array (FPGA). FPGAs have 
a library of math functions (i.e., SIN, EXP, SQRT) and logic functions (i.e., 
AND, OR, XOR) that can be used by the programmer to analyze or manipu­
late data. In comparison, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is hard­
coded to perform a specific function and cannot be changed by the user. Since 
they are fully optimized for one purpose, ASICs can outperform FPGAs pro­
grammed to fulfill the same purpose. However, advancements in FPGA tech­
nology are closing this performance gap, and ASICs are becoming less popular.
Unfortunately, adding a digital circuit to an RF module is not without 
challenges. High-speed circuits have switching or clock speeds in the hundreds 
or thousands of megahertz range. These frequencies may be in the RF band 
(direct coupling) or have harmonics or mixing products that are in the RF 
band (indirect coupling). Signals can radiate from one component to another 
or propagate through the ground plane to the RF circuitry (if digital and RF 
circuits share a ground plane).
Issues related to digital circuits can be difficult to trace back to their ori­
gin. This section discusses techniques for using digital circuits effectively in RF 
modules.
Figure 8.10  Example Monte Carlo analysis for a two-way Wilkinson divider.

252 
Radar RF Circuit Design
8.7.1  Common Digital Uses
Digital circuits are most commonly used to add “smarts” to RF circuits. They 
can collect data from sensors (i.e., temperature probes or chemical detectors), 
bias circuits, and input/output waveforms and perform analysis. Simple circuits 
may adjust bias voltages to compensate for temperature effects. More compli­
cated circuits may correct for aging, radiation, or other environmental effects.
Circuits are now available that can process at RF (gigabit) speed, and 
microwave speed is on the horizon. Processing at this speed enables real-time 
waveform sampling, manipulation, and adaptability. Bias and port impedance 
can be optimized to provide peak performance (i.e., output power, efficiency, 
and linearity) to the system in real time [4]. If advanced knowledge of the per­
formance need is available (as is the case in a cognitive radar), the digital circuit 
can adapt the RF circuitry so the module performance is modified exactly when 
needed [5].
APD, discussed in Section 4.4.3, is a way to improve amplifier linearity. 
The same technique can be implemented using digital means. This is referred 
to as DPD. Since DPD is implemented using a single integrated circuit, it can 
be much more versatile than APD. For example, an FPGA can be programmed 
to implement DPD and correct for performance changes due to bias drift, tem­
perature, aging, and waveform characteristics (i.e., channel width). The same 
can be implemented using APD, but it would require an extensive and com­
plicated set of hardware. Additionally, DPD can be programmed to calibrate 
each module at start-up. This would correct for module-to-module variation 
due to manufacturing tolerances. An APD circuit would either need to be cali­
brated during manufacturing (a costly practice) or designed to fit nominal per­
formance (some units will perform better than others). When only a relatively 
small improvement to linearity is needed (10–15 dB), adding a small APD 
circuit would be easier than incorporating a digital circuit.
Digital circuits are great for implementing built-in test (BIT), built-in 
self-test (BIST), or built-in test and repair (BITR) capability. Usually couplers 
are placed at strategic points in the module (i.e., at the input and output of an 
amplifier). The coupled port is connected to an FPGA through an ADC. A 
simple test circuit determines whether the signal amplitude is as expected. If 
not, then a failure has been detected. An error message can be transmitted to the 
user (if the infrastructure is in place to do so), or an auxiliary set of hardware can 
be enabled (if available). The latter capability (repair) is an example of BITR. If 
performance is degraded, a BITR circuit may be able to modify circuit param­
eters (i.e., bias voltage or tunable elements) to regain performance.
Digital circuitry can also implement modulation schemes. Pulse-width 
modulation (PWM), for example, is used to reduce average prime power 
consumption. PWM is mostly used in CW applications, but the same prin­

 
Transmit/Receive Module Integration 
253
cipal applies to pulse modulators commonly used in past and present radars. 
Figure 8.11 demonstrates the operation of PWM.
In Figure 8.11, the analog waveform is a simple sine wave (dotted curve). 
The amplifier is turned on in short pulses (or bursts, light color trace) and 
driven into an averaging filter (i.e., an inductive circuit). The modulated output 
(solid curve) then resembles a stepped version of the analog waveform. Since 
the amplifier is only consuming prime power while pulsing, most of the time 
no prime power is being consumed. In order to maintain an acceptable level of 
signal fidelity, high-speed digital circuitry is needed.
8.7.2  Current Digital Infrastructure
In most (if not all) modern radars, digital circuitry already exists. Figure 8.12 
shows a high-level block diagram for a modern radar.
All of the “brains” in a radar lie in the digital circuitry. Digital circuits 
determine the appropriate radar waveform characteristics in the transmitter. 
In the receiver, they process the data into information that is valuable to the 
operator. Since antennas cannot propagate digital signals, the purpose of the 
RF circuitry is to prepare the waveform for propagation (i.e., through frequen­
cy upconversion and amplification), propagate and receive the waveform (i.e., 
through the antenna), and prepare the waveform for analysis (i.e., through am­
plification, frequency downconversion, and demodulation). If digital circuitry 
provides the brains, RF circuitry provides the “brawn.” Since digital circuitry is 
already available in the system, RF designers might as well use it.
System-on-chip (SOC) is an approach that integrates digital, analog, and 
RF circuitry onto a single chip. It is popular in the nonradar commercial mar­
ket as a means to keep up with the demands for size reduction (i.e., smaller 
cell phones and thinner televisions). An entire radar T/R module (minus the 
antenna) can be reduced to a single integrated circuit. An impressive degree of 
size and cost reduction can be achieved using SOC. There are significant design 
challenges, including preventing crosstalk, maintaining ground plane integrity, 
and heat removal.
8.7.3  Digital Radiation
High-speed digital circuits can have clock speeds in the hundreds to thousands 
of megahertz range. These signals can radiate or couple to other components 
that can radiate. The faster the switching speed, the greater the potential for 
radiation. Similarly to RF, radiation from digital circuits exhibit near- and far-
field behavior.
There are two types of digital radiation. The first, differential mode radia­
tion, is caused from conductive paths around a circuit. This effect is similar to

at various locations around the circuit that spur radiation. This effect is similar 
to a small monopole antenna, so the magnitude of the electric field can be de­
termined by [2]:

measured from the component surface (radians). Mitigation techniques are dis­
cussed in Section 8.7.4.
8.7.4  Avoiding Mixed-Signal Issues
Whenever analog (or RF) and digital are used together, the combination is 
known as mixed signal. The following techniques are suggested to ensure proper 
mixed-signal operation:
Figure 8.12   High-level block diagram of modern radar with digital circuitry.

256 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Don’t use integrated circuits with switching or processing speed greater 
than what is needed. For example, temperature changes happen over 
many seconds (or longer); there is no need for microsecond resolution 
in a temperature-compensation circuit. Faster speeds increase the like­
lihood of a spurious signal generating in-band, consume more prime 
power, and are more expensive.
• Be mindful of switching speed and internal clock timing. Calculate all 
potential harmonics and mixing products and, if possible, add filters to 
remove them prior to the RF circuitry. Keep a list during testing so that 
if a spurious signal is detected, it may be traced to the digital circuit.
• Coupling is stronger between components whose direction of propaga­
tion is parallel. Rotating components so they are placed perpendicular to 
each other will reduce coupling.
• Separate and isolate RF and digital ground planes. This requires mul­
tiple power supplies but can improve isolation by 60 dB.
• Route metal traces around components rather than under. As shown 
Figure 8.13, when components are in the way, signal traces can route 
under or around the obstruction. Routing through the substrate aids in 
size reduction, but it also causes more radiation.
Incorporate a frequency-selective surface (FSS) to block unwanted fre­
quencies. Isolation can be improved by as much as 100 dB for narrow-band 
applications.
An electronic band gap (EBG) is a type of FSS that can be patterned on 
the topside or backside (ground plane) of a substrate to block frequencies from 
propagating. An example of both topologies is shown in Figure 8.14, where se­
lect frequencies are blocked from traveling between port 1 and port 2. Example 
EBG structures are shown in Figure 8.15 [6].
By wrapping an EBG around a component, as shown in Figure 8.16, it 
is isolated from other components within the frequency range of the EBG. It 
is useful for blocking difficult-to-remove frequencies like those generated from 
digital switching speed.

On the Measurement Bench
For an engineer, there is probably no greater thrill than seeing a design come 
to life. Unfortunately, despite all the preparation required to make a low-risk 
design, simulations can’t predict everything.
Once the design is complete, the real fun begins. The bench demonstra­
tion is the engineer’s first opportunity to determine how accurate the design 
really was. If accurate models have been used (Chapter 3) and a proper Monte 
Carlo has been performed (Section 8.6), then measured results should come 
close to predicted performance.
This chapter is dedicated to getting the best measured results and ad­
dresses what to do when the results are not as expected. Further, the chapter 
discusses the importance of determining the uncertainty associated with a par­
ticular measurement or measurement bench and presents methods for design­
ing a good test fixture and de-embedding its contribution to measured results. 
The chapter also lists different types of connectors, adapters, and cables with 
their respective advantages. Finally, the chapter describes how to stabilize active 
circuits (that have achieved their desired results) to maintain performance over 
their lifetime.
9.1  Measurement Uncertainty
Before beginning a measurement, it is important to determine the uncertainty 
of the test bench. In metrology (the science of measurement), there are two 
types of measurement uncertainty:
• Accuracy: How closely the measured result is to the true value;

262 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Precision: How repeatable the result is from measurement to measure­
ment.
For example, if the output power of an amplifier is exactly 10W, but the 
instrumentation measures 5W after testing multiple times, the measurement is 
precise but not accurate.
Ensuring that a measurement setup is both accurate and precise is criti­
cally important. Otherwise, there is no way of knowing if a design meets speci­
fication. Every measurement has some degree of measurement uncertainty, 
which is the difference between the actual value and the one reported from the 
measurement. For example, if a current meter has a measurement uncertainty 
of ±0.1% and the meter display reads 12.5000A, the actual current is between 
12.4875 and 12.5125A.
Practical Note
Metrologists avoid using the term “measurement error” when referring to measure­
ment uncertainty. “Error” gives the impression that a mistake or oversight has been 
made, which isn’t necessarily the case. “Uncertainty” implies a degree of randomness, 
which is a better description of the phenomenon.
When a component is being measured (especially for the first time) and 
the results are not as expected, it’s natural to assume that the problem is in the 
component. It’s always a good idea to first check the measurement bench to 
determine if the results are within the degree of measurement uncertainty. (Ide­
ally, this should be done before starting the measurement so a proper expecta­
tion is set.) At a high level, measurement uncertainty can be determined by the 
following:
• Determining the uncertainty for the measurement equipment (usually 
listed in the product specification) and performing a statistical analysis 
to roll up the individual uncertainties into a bench uncertainty;
• Testing a measurement standard (accurately calibrated device with 
known performance) or golden unit (device with known good perfor­
mance that other units can be compared to empirically).
Neither approach is without limitations. Equipment specifications tend 
to state conservative measurement uncertainty values. To achieve high test 
yields, engineers will be required to overdesign components to compensate for 
the wide uncertainty range. Measuring “known” standards can determine the 
precision of a measurement bench, but they introduce their own uncertainty 
when determining accuracy.

 
On the Measurement Bench 
263
Practical Note
It is not acceptable practice to improve accuracy by measuring a component multiple 
times and averaging the results. Uncertainty should be presumed to be uniformly 
distributed so the average value is not necessarily the most accurate.
If measurement uncertainty is greater than desired, it can be minimized 
by the following [1]: 
• Using only equipment with valid calibration (some equipment must be 
calibrated annually);
• Reducing cable lengths;
• Reducing the number of adapters;
• Avoiding chained adapters to achieve the necessary input and output 
type (i.e., if an SMA male to 2.9-mm female is needed, don’t insert an 
additional 3.5-mm adapter because that’s what is available. Procure an 
SMA male to 2.9-mm female adapter);
• Using the same connector type (i.e., 2.9-mm) throughout the bench;
• Using a torque wrench to connect cables, connectors, and adapters to 
ensure that proper tightness is provided;
• Using only quality cables, connectors, and adapters (dispose of any bro­
ken or questionable units to prevent inadvertent use by someone else);
• Add an attenuator or isolator to protect the measurement equipment 
from high-power reflections.
Measurement uncertainty cannot be avoided so it should always be incor­
porated into a specification as design margin.
9.2  Test Fixture Design
While in production, special fixtures may be used to perform component-lev­
el testing without causing wear to the interfaces (i.e., connectors, microstrip 
launch, or CPW launch). Production fixtures are designed for fast, repeatable 
(precise), and reliable (accurate) testing. Design techniques for those fixtures 
are outside the scope of this book, but engineering-level (or R&D-level) test 
fixtures are worthy of discussion [2].
A well-designed test fixture would introduce minimal loss, impedance 
mismatch, and parasitic effects to the component being tested [commonly re­
ferred to as the device under test (DUT)]. A poorly designed test fixture can 

264 
Radar RF Circuit Design
actually change the DUT performance and render the measured results useless. 
Calibration is used to mathematically remove the effects of the measurement 
bench and fixtures so that the DUT performance can be isolated. However, cal­
ibration does not change what the DUT “sees” when connected. For example, 
a fixture with poor impedance match can be calibrated to represent a perfect 
50-Ω match, but the DUT will still behave as if it is poorly matched at its ports. 
The measured results will be misleading.
Similarly, a good test fixture should provide the same environmental con­
ditions as the operational environment. For example, if a DUT operates hotter 
in the test fixture than it would in the operating environment because the test 
fixture has a lower thermal conductivity, the measured results will be mislead­
ing. This can be overcome by adding a thermocouple at the DUT-to-test fixture 
interface and monitoring temperature.
For DUTs that do not use rugged connectors at the ports (discussed in 
Section 9.2.2), light contact is usually desired at all points between the DUT 
and test fixture. A variety of plunger-style or pogo pins are commercially avail­
able to make light, short-duration contact. Sometimes wire or ribbon bonds can 
provide a good connection with minimal disturbance to the DUT connection 
pads. Figure 9.1 shows a simple two-port DUT with ribbon-bond connections.
Practical Note
For DUTs with active components, include voltage “test points” throughout the cir­
cuit. During debug, it is very useful to have connection points where DC probes can 
be attached without risking damage to the RF circuitry. If these test points can be con­
nected directly to ports on the test fixture, then gate and drain voltages (for example) 
can be monitored in real time during testing.
9.2.1  De-Embedding Fixture Effects
If a measurement fixture could ever be perfectly matched with zero insertion 
loss and phase length, then it would have no contribution to the measured 
Figure 9.1  Simple two-port DUT in a test fixture with ribbon-bond connections.

 
On the Measurement Bench

DUT performance. Unfortunately, even the best measurement fixtures have 
some amount of impedance mismatch, loss, and phase length. In some appli­
cations (particularly below 10–100 MHz), these quantities may be negligible 
and can be ignored. For most applications, fixture effects must be removed (or 
de-embedded) from the measured results.
Arguably the easiest and most accurate way to de-embed fixture effects is 
to create an equivalent circuit model between the DUT and each measurement 
port. Figure 9.2 shows a circuit for the fixture shown in Figure 9.1. Since the 
measurement fixture is symmetric, there is a line of symmetry in the circuit as 
well.
A frequency-dependent attenuator (A) is used to represent the connec­
tor. The impedance (Zblock) and phase delay (θblock) traversing the end block is 
represented by a transmission line. The impedance (Zsub) and phase delay (θsub) 
traversing the RF substrate is represented by a second transmission line. The 
wire bond (L) connecting the fixture to the DUT is represented by an inductor.
To extract the model parameters (A, Zblock, θblock, Zsub, θsub, and L), de-
embed fixtures should be made to provide short circuit and thru information. 
This is shown in Figure 9.3. The short circuit can be implemented with a via 
or solder joint to ground. An open circuit can be used in lieu of a short circuit, 
but with less accuracy. (The fringing fields at the end of the microstrip will be 
different in the test fixture than in the de-embed fixture).
Figure 9.2  Equivalent circuit model for the test fixture shown in Figure 9.1.
Figure 9.3  De-embed fixtures for the test fixture shown in Figure 9.1: short circuit (left) and 
thru circuit (right).

266 
Radar RF Circuit Design
The shorted fixture (left image in Figure 9.3) is used to optimize Sxx mag­
nitude and phase. The thru fixture (right image in Figure 9.3) is used to opti­
mize Sxy magnitude and phase. Figure 9.4 shows this process.
In this two-port scenario, the values for A, Zblock, θblock, Zsub, and θsub can 
be optimized from the measured S11 magnitude and phase in the short-circuit 
fixture. Then, the value of L can be determined from the measured S21 magni­
tude and phase in the thru fixture. The process can be tailored for more than 
two-port circuits.
Once the equivalent circuit model has been determined, the De_Embed­
SnP component in Keysight ADS can be used to mathematically de-embed the 
fixture behavior from the DUT performance.
9.2.2  Connectors, Adapters, and Cables
Generally, the test fixture is going to connect to a piece of measurement equip­
ment (i.e., network or spectrum analyzer) through flexible cables. Benches are 
either set up for insertable or thru DUTs where the input and output connector 
sexes are different, or standard DUTs where the input and output sexes are the 
same (usually female).
All too often, connector, adapter, and cable selection is determined by 
parts available in the lab. Selection should be made based on frequency of op­
eration, power-handling capability, and loss. These items all have maximum 
frequencies of operation where higher-order modes will begin to propagate. 
Flexible cables will also have a minimum bend radius specified by the manu­
facturer. Bending a cable at less than this angle can also excite higher-order 
modes. Higher-order modes can cause instability in active components or gen­
erate mixing products with the fundamental frequency, both invalidating the 
measurement.
There are scores of different connector, adapter, and cable types to meet a 
wide range of form factors, operating frequencies, and power-handling capabili­
ties; the most popular types are described in the following subsections. As with 
most microwave components, the higher they operate in frequency, the more 
Figure 9.4  De-embed process using the fixtures shown in Figure 9.3 and the equivalent cir­
cuit model shown in Figure 9.2.

 
On the Measurement Bench 
267
expensive they become. Male connectors typically have a center pin (plug) and 
internal threads, and female connectors have a center sleeve (jack) and external 
threads.
Bare wire
Typically used for DC connections, bare wires can support RF signals up to 
approximately 10 MHz [3]. To provide shielding, the signal (usually red) and 
ground (usually black) wires are twisted or braided together. When twisted 
tightly, they provide nearly the same electric shielding as a coax cable but with 
reduced magnetic shielding [3].
BNC
BNC connectors are generally used as a robust and easy-to-use (no torque 
wrench required) DC connector. They are relatively inexpensive and operate to 
4 GHz. Due to their large size, they are better suited for test fixture usage than 
product usage.
N
N connectors are physically the largest listed in this text. They operate through 
X-band and some also operate through Ku-band. They are designed to han­
dle high power and can easily operate with hundreds of watts and more than 
1,000V root mean square (RMS). Since they are so rugged, connectors are 
often tightened by hand rather than using a torque wrench. For many applica­
tions, their size is prohibitively large.
Subminiature Version A (SMA)
SMA connectors are among the most popular in use today. The maximum 
operating frequency varies by manufacturer, but generally they are safe for use 
through Ku-band (higher-quality manufacturers will specify through K-band). 
Since they are PTFE- filled, SMA connectors tend to be more durable than 
air-filled varieties. Also, SMA connectors will mate with 3.5-mm and 2.92-mm 
connectors—although doing so is risky. The latter two are much more fragile 
(and expensive).
Practical Note
After spending weeks debugging a highly sophisticated measurement bench for a mul­
timission radar emulator, the root cause was found to be a single bent center conduc­
tor on an SMA-to-2.92–mm adapter. The cost to replace the adapter was less than 
$5, while the cost to find the broken adapter was around $54,000. The moral: Always 
check connections carefully.

268 
Radar RF Circuit Design
Subminiature Version B (SMB)
SMB connectors are smaller than SMA connectors. They operate from approxi­
mately DC to 4 GHz. Unlike SMAs, SMBs snap together rather than screw 
together.
3.5 mm
Probably the second most popular connector, 3.5-mm connectors are reason­
ably priced and operate to 26.5 GHz. Since they are air-filled, they are more 
fragile than SMAs.
2.92 mm (or simply 2.9 mm) or K
Similar in appearance to 3.5-mm connectors, 2.92-mm connectors have a 
smaller conductor diameter and operate to 40 GHz.
2.4 mm
While they resemble 2.92-mm connectors, 2.4-mm connectors have an even 
smaller conductor diameter. Due to their stringent manufacturing tolerances, 
2.4-mm connectors are quite expensive, but they operate to 50 GHz.
Subminiature Push-On (SMP)
SMP connectors are useful when really small size is critical. They are especially 
popular for military applications. Similarly to SMBs, SMPs are also snap-on 
connections. However, SMPs are smaller than SMBs. There are several SMP 
sizes available that provide frequency coverage up to 65 GHz. Corning, Incor­
porated, has a line of SMP connectors that have been trademarked: GPO™, 
GPPO™, and G3PO™ (each one smaller and higher frequency than the 
prior).
Other Notable Connectors
• MCX: Similar to but smaller than SMB, MCX is a snap-on connector 
that operates to approximately 6 GHz;
• MMCX: The same style and operating frequency as the MCX, but 
smaller in size;
• TNC: Similar to BNC, but it operates through X-band and has a 
threaded connection;
• 1.85 mm: Smaller version of 2.4 mm that operates to 65 GHz;
• 1 mm: Smaller version of 1.85 mm that operates to 110 GHz.

9.3  Tips for Making it All Work
One always hopes that a design works exactly as expected the first time it is 
measured, but that isn’t always the case. From the Monte Carlo analysis dis­
cussed in Section 8.6, the range of expected performance should be known. 
When measurements do not fall within that expected range, here are some tips 
for common issues and ways to approach them.
9.3.1  Unstable Active Circuits
When an active circuit is unstable, place a spectrum analyzer or oscilloscope on 
the DC bias or RF output to determine the frequency of oscillation. Then, if 
the oscillation is below the circuit operating frequency, try one or more of the 
following:
• Place a large-value capacitor between the drain and source voltages;
• Place a series inductor on the drain;
• Place a series resistor on the gate;
• Place a ferrite bead on the gate or drain bias;
• Verify that your DC bias wires are properly shielded. If bare wires are 
used, make sure that they are twisted or replace them with coax lines. 
Never cross gate bias wires and drain bias wires.
If the oscillation is within the circuit operating frequency, try one or more 
of the following:
• Add an attenuator to the input and/or output of the DUT to minimize 
VSWR reflection;
• Operate the circuit pulsed or if it is already operating pulsed, narrow the 
pulse width.
These are not necessarily long-term fixes, but once the DUT is stable, you 
can reanalyze and retune the circuit to improve stability.
9.3.2  Incorrect Frequency Response
If the frequency response has shifted or if signals appear at the output that are 
not supposed to be there, there are several things to investigate:

270 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Wires and ribbon bonds usually add 0.1–1-nH inductance everywhere 
they are placed. This can shift frequency, add phase length, and change 
the impedance. Ensure that all bonds are as small as possible (while still 
providing strain relief), and when possible, use multiple bonds to reduce 
inductance.
• Eliminate elbow bends or kinked cables from the measurement bench 
since they add parasitic inductance.
• Be mindful of background electrical noise sources, including the follow­
ing (approximate frequencies):
• 60-Hz and higher harmonics: Lights, power, and motors;
• 535–1700 KHz: AM radio;
• 30–300 MHz: FM radio and TV broadcasting;
• 900 MHz: Cordless devices;
• 2 GHz: Mobile phones;
• 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz: Wireless LAN.
Intermittent ripple is usually caused by vibrations. Foot traffic, nearby 
elevators, or adjacent machinery can induce movement in bond wires or probe 
contact points. These small inductance changes can appear in the measured 
results.
Practical Note
It is not uncommon for labs near airports, train tracks, or major highways to conduct 
sensitive measurements only at night. Even when using an isolation table, periodic 
strong vibrations can affect measured results.
9.3.3  Radiation or Coupling
Radiation and coupling mechanisms are discussed in Section 8.3. To determine 
if airborne leakage is an issue—If safe to do so—move a piece of RF-absorbing 
material around the circuit while operational and look for changes in the mea­
sured response. Common problematic areas include the following:
• Metal sidewalls;
• Areas surrounding active circuits;
• Wraparound structures that connect top metal layers to bottom metal 
layers.

 
On the Measurement Bench 
271
Do not place RF-absorbing material directly on top of transmission lines 
(which will only dampen the signal you are trying to protect) or sensitive struc­
tures (i.e., MMICs and bond wires). Once a source of radiation is found, shield 
the area properly or leave the absorbing material in place (if possible).
The same process can be repeated with aluminum foil or another conduc­
tive material. Be careful not to make contact with any conducting surface.
9.3.4  Low Gain or Output Power
If gain or output power is low, first correct any issues with stability and fre­
quency response. If some frequencies in the operating band have much lower 
performance than others (referred to as suck-outs), check for evidence of radia­
tion or coupling that could be canceling the signal at certain frequencies. If no 
issues are found, then consider the following:
• Measure the DC bias voltage as close to the circuit as possible. Some­
times a voltage drop occurs between the voltage source (i.e., DC supply) 
and the DUT. The circuit may be underbiased.
• Ensure that the DC bias current is as expected. Tweak the DC bias volt­
age to give the correct DC bias current (i.e., tweak the gate voltage to 
provide the correct quiescent current).
• Check the operating temperature. Gain and output power drop by ap­
proximately 0.016 dB/°C per stage so if the DUT is hotter than ex­
pected, that could explain the drop.
• (If safe to do so) step through the circuit with a pigtail from the input 
to the output to determine where in the circuit the performance devi­
ates from the expected value. A pigtail is a short wire attached to an RF 
connector that can be attached to a network analysis, spectrum analyzer, 
power meter, oscilloscope, or similar measurement equipment. A well-
made pigtail can operate to several gigahertz.
• Tune the circuit using ground pads or trombone structures as discussed 
in Section 7.6.2. Alternatively, cap sticks can be used to manually in­
crease capacitance. Cap sticks can be made by gluing surface-mount ca­
pacitors to the end of a nonconductive stick. When pressed (or stacked) 
on top of another capacitor already in the circuit, the values add. Mul­
tiple cap sticks can be made with different values to tune the circuit. 
Once an optimized value is determined, the capacitor can be replaced 
with the higher value.

272 
Radar RF Circuit Design
9.3.5  High Loss
In passive circuits, instability is not an issue, but excess loss can be an issue. 
Sources of loss can be determined in one of the following ways:
• Since even passive circuits radiate, verify that energy is not being lost 
by coupling to nearby circuits using the technique discussed in Section 
9.3.3.
• Verify that line widths are as expected. This can usually be done using an 
optical microscope eyepiece reticle.
• Verify that the RF substrate thickness is as expected. This can usually be 
done using a blank substrate and a set of calipers. Remember to subtract 
the top and bottom metal thickness.
• Since transmission lines with excessive surface roughness will have high­
er than expected metal loss, assess roughness by comparing the metal 
shine against a known-good sample. Rough surfaces appear less shiny 
than smooth surfaces. If available, roughness can also be measured using 
a surface profilometer.
• Check surface-mount components to ensure that they are well attached 
and are of the correct value.
Practical Note
Digital RLC (or LCR) tweezers are useful for measuring surface-mount resistors, in­
ductors, and capacitors. They can be used to quickly verify that all components within 
a circuit are the correct value.
9.3.6  Catastrophic Damage at Initial Test
The most difficult type of failure to diagnose is when catastrophic damage (i.e., 
a transistor pops) occurs at initial test. Even a DUT with poor performance pro­
vides hardware that can usually be investigated. Catastrophic damage at initial 
test can usually be avoided with the following precautions:
• For active circuit, apply DC bias in stages.
• Pinch off the gate with a very small drain voltage applied; verify that no 
drain current is present.
• Increase the drain voltage to the operating value; verify that no drain 
current is still present.

 
On the Measurement Bench 
273
• Slowly bring the gate out of pinch-off and watch for a steady increase in 
the drain current; stop if any fluctuations are found in the drain current 
as this is a sign of instability.
• Once the quiescent bias is met, apply the RF signal.
• Verify that all cables are placed within their rated bend radius. If this 
radius is exceeded, the cable dielectric separates from the conductor and 
a charge builds up (known as the triboelectric effect). This charge can dis­
sipate at any time and cause failures to occur.
9.4  Transistor Stabilization
When a radar is deployed, it needs to provide consistent behavior over the 
operating lifetime. At the component level, an additional process step must be 
performed whenever active circuits are used. When a transistor is operated for 
the very first time, output power, gain, and drain current drop and gate current 
rises over a relatively short period of time (usually minutes or hours). Fortunate­
ly, if operated long enough, the performance will reach an equilibrium point or 
stabilize (not be confused with electrical stability, discussed in Chapter 4). Once 
a transistor has stabilized, the power, gain, and current will remain consistent 
throughout the operational lifetime. Figure 9.5 shows a typical set of stabiliza­
tion curves for a fixed-input power and bias level; all values are normalized.
Usually, output power settles first and happens quickly in the stabilization 
process. A good rule of thumb is the 90/10 rule; 90% of output power stabiliza­
tion happens in the first 10% of the process. Drain current usually settles sec­
ond and follows an 80/20 rule. Gate current settles last and ultimately defines 
Figure 9.5  Typical set of normalized transistor stabilization curves.

274 
Radar RF Circuit Design
the stabilization duration. Once all three levels are settled, they will remain flat 
even if the component is turned off and rebiased at a later time. Every foundry 
process is different so not all transistors follow this exact process.
The duration required to achieve stabilization depends on temperature; 
the higher the temperature, the shorter the required stabilization duration. 
However, the operating lifetime of a transistor is also dependent on tempera­
ture; the higher the temperature, the shorter the operating lifetime. The tem­
perature must be chosen so that stabilization can be achieved in a reasonable 
amount of time but does not take useable life out of the transistor.
Usually, foundries can provide a suggested stabilization process (tempera­
ture, D/C bias, input power level, and duration). From this starting point, the 
duration can be customized using the Arrhenius equation, (9.1) [4].

where τN is the duration at TN (any time unit), TN is the temperature (K), Ea 
is the activation energy (electronvolts, eV), and k is Boltzmann’s constant (8.6 
× 105 eV/K).
For example, if a transistor has an activation energy of 1.5 eV and a sta­
bilization process of 100 hours at 85°C (358K) base temperature, the same 
stabilization could be achieved in 14 hours at 100°C (373K) base temperature 
(provided that the operational lifetime is still sufficient after operating at 100°C 
base temperature).
Practical Note
The physical location of the base temperature can vary from foundry to foundry. Be 
sure to differentiate between the channel or junction, the backside of the transistor, 
and the backside of the carrier if the transistor is packaged.  The channel or junction 
temperature will be hotter than the surrounding area.
Not all applications require stable performance. If the radar system has 
the ability to adjust input power and DC bias, then having transistors that 
change performance over time is not an issue. For these applications, a screening 
process is needed to expose components with latent defects (issues that cannot 
be found with normal inspection). Generally the requirements for screening are 
determined empirically. A large sample set of components is tested to determine 
how long it takes for a typical defected unit to fail. That duration is multiplied 
by a safety factor to provide margin and becomes the screening criteria.

Exercises
1.	 A noise measurement is unable to differentiate between the noise gen­
erated from the DUT and background noise. What can be done to 
improve this measurement?
2.	 You are designing an amplifier module that must have at least 100-W 
(50 dBm) output power. The measurement uncertainty for the test 
bench is ±0.5 dB. In order to compensate for this uncertainty, what 
should your design goal be (assume that margin is already factored 
into the 100-W specification)?
3.	 It has been shown that ribbons need to be as short as possible to mini­
mize inductance, but long enough to provide strain relief. How much 
height is needed for a 10-mil-wide, 1-mil-thick gold ribbon that tra­
verses a 10-mil-wide gap? Assume that the storage temperature ranges 
from –50°C to +150°C.

Final Thoughts
The proliferation of radars in the commercial and military markets is going to 
continue for decades to come. This book is intended as a reference for engineers 
embarking on the challenging and rewarding path of component design for 
radars and a guidebook for how that design impacts overall system performance 
and cost. As the book comes to a close, please consider these top takeaway 
points, summarized as follows.
• Collaboration between system and component designers before hard­
ware is built is critically important to truly optimize performance. The 
best way to facilitate this dialog is by understanding both sides. This 
book provides the background necessary for system engineers to design 
components and for component engineers to optimize for radar needs.
• Allow for design iterations, especially between system designers and 
components engineers. It’s impossible to get it “perfect” on the first pass! 
Many major programs have incurred significant schedule and cost over­
runs by not embracing this design reality.
• Since understanding design equations is beneficial for building an in­
tuition of trade-offs, review them carefully and remember the variables 
that contribute to critical performance metrics, such as power, efficien­
cy/loss, size, and heat removal. The exercises provided at the end of each 
chapter are an excellent way to both test your knowledge and grow your 
intuition.
• Leverage design software, such as Keysight ADS, to expedite the design 
process. Use the simulator to determine integrated performance under 
all operating conditions. (Don’t forget to include bond wires and other 
connection mechanisms.)

278 
Radar RF Circuit Design
• Choose the right method for mode propagation (i.e., coax, microstrip, 
stripline, waveguide, or coplanar waveguide) based on loss, size, operat­
ing frequency, dispersion, cost, and producibility.
• Pay close attention to material selection. Make the decision based on 
physical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, chemical, manufacturing, and 
environmental properties.
• Take great care to ensure that component models are accurate. Try to 
capture as many parasitic or nonideal effects as possible. Mitigate dis­
continuities along the signal path.
• When designing amplifiers, expand beyond the ubiquitous class AB. 
There are many other techniques that offer better efficiency, linearity, 
output power, and operating bandwidth.
• Although noise in amplifier components is unavoidable, minimize it 
with proper material selection, DC biasing, impedance, and tempera­
ture management.
• Design components with both electrical and mechanical performance in 
mind. Having phenomenal electrical performance is meaningless if the 
component degrades due to thermal or structural stress.
• Give passive components the same level of attention as every other com­
ponent. Active components usually get the most attention, but passive 
components are often what drive size, cost, and loss.
• Remember that determining the ideal form factor is an important deci­
sion. MMICs, hybrids, multichip modules, and the various packaging 
styles all have unique attributes that contribute to size, cost, and perfor­
mance.
• Design with manufacturing in mind from the beginning of the process. 
Cost, yield, and lifetime can all be significantly improved by considering 
these metrics during the design phase.
• Maintain proper grounding so that signals propagate as intended. The 
old adage, “you can’t have enough ground connections,” is not necessar­
ily true; you need the right kind of ground connections.
• Use shielding, orientation, and spacing to isolate components, since 
radiation or coupling effects between components can degrade perfor­
mance or even cause failure.
• Prevent the many types of oscillations possible (i.e., even-mode, odd-
mode, spurious, and loop) with good planning, layout, and simulation. 
These can be tricky to diagnose on the bench.

 
Final Thoughts 
279
• Use Monte Carlo analysis to predict and mitigate variability of perfor­
mance during manufacturing. Any and all contributors to performance 
variation should be included for the analysis to be accurate.
• Integrate digital and RF circuitry to enable a new level of performance 
potential, but do it carefully. Otherwise, the circuitries’ proximity to 
each other can cause performance degradation and other issues.
• Know the accuracy and precision of the measurement bench. Some 
degree of uncertainty is present in every test system. That uncertainty 
should be factored into every performance specification.
• Choose the right connector for your application. Many options are 
available based on size, cost, loss, power handling, durability, and fre­
quency of operation. Make sure the one you select does not sacrifice.
• Remember that while all components benefit from screening for latent 
defects, some semiconductors require an additional stabilization process. 
Ignoring this step could result in a performance drop during operation.
