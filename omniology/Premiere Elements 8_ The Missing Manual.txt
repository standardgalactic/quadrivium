The Missing Manual Series
Missing Manuals are witty, superbly written guides to computer products that
don’t come with printed manuals (which is just about all of them). Each book fea-
tures a handcrafted index; cross-references to specific pages (not just chapters);
and RepKover, a detached-spine binding that lets the book lie perfectly flat with-
out the assistance of weights or cinder blocks.

Introduction
Film will only become art when its materials are
as inexpensive as pencil and paper.
——Jean Cocteau, poet and filmmaker
Armed with a camcorder and Premiere Elements video-editing software, you can
create art. Or, if your goals are little less lofty, you can chronicle family events,
show off on YouTube, or produce a video project for school. Making motion pic-
tures still costs more than pencil and paper, but it gets cheaper every day. If you’re
a hungry poet or a 12-year-old who wants to break into Hollywood, it doesn’t cost
much to get started. Somewhere, Jean Cocteau is smiling.
For many, video is a communication tool just like pencil and paper—or like a
word processor. Computers and the Internet make communicating via video quick
and easy. You don’t have to splice and glue bits of film together or work with a
production house to turn your raw clips into a finished product. Today’s video
projects go directly from camcorder to computer to audience, and the entire jour-
ney can take just a few hours or, in some cases, minutes. Premiere Elements is the
tool you use to do everything except capture the pictures. It moves videos from
your camcorder to your computer, helps you find the best shots, and assembles
them into a story. When your movie’s ready for an audience, Premiere helps you
deliver it via disc or the Web, too.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Introduction
About This Book
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual is divided into four parts, each contain-
ing several chapters. In addition, to help you practice your budding skills as a video
editor, you’ll find free, downloadable video clips for the exercises in this book at
the Missing Manuals website (see “Living Examples” on page 8 for instructions).
Here’s a little more information about each section in Premiere Elements 8: The
Missing Manual:
• Part One: Start a New Project shows you how to gather all the elements you
need for your movie—video clips, songs, sound effects, and still photos. You’ll
learn how to use Elements Organizer as an efficient organizational tool for all
the movie clips and media files you import. You can attach keywords and rank
clips by quality and content, along with several other sanity-saving strategies.
• Part Two: Create Your Movie focuses on what most people think of as video edit-
ing. You learn how to trim your raw footage to just the parts that tell your story
and then build your movie clip by clip. You’ll add cool transitions between clips
and include any of dozens of special effects to spice up your footage.
Unless you’re Charlie Chaplin, you’ll want to add a soundtrack and sound
effects, too, so you’ll learn how to build a multi-layered audio track. Need back-
ground music or the sound of a car crash? You’ll get tips on finding royalty-free
music and sound effects.
• Part Three: Share Your Movie is all about showing your movie to an audience.
It starts off with a brief background on video formats and then tells you how to
use presets to export your finished film. All the details are here for uploading
your movies to YouTube or any other website, saving them to DVD or Blu-ray
disc, or putting them on your iPod Touch, iPhone, or other handheld gadget.
• Part Four: Appendixes are reference guides. You don’t have to read them from
start to finish, but they’re there when you need them, all neatly arranged. You’ll
find help on installation and finding support, along with each and every menu
command in Premiere Elements and Elements Organizer.
Why Premiere Elements?
If you shot still photos when you were on vacation in Greece, you wouldn’t come
home and show your friends and family every picture you took. No, you’d go
through them and get rid of that accidental shot of the ground, the overexposed
Parthenon, and the dinner table where the food looks great but everyone’s eyes are
closed. Video editing is a lot like that. It’s not unusual to use about 10 percent of
the video you shoot. So, job number one for Premiere Elements is to help you find
your good shots. Its next job is to make the good shots look even better. That
includes everything from correcting picture problems to adding transitions, special

effects, and titles. Last and certainly not least, there’s distribution. Any Hollywood
big shot will tell you it doesn’t do any good to produce a movie if you can’t deliver
it to an audience. Premiere Elements handles that, too.
If you’ve got a PC, you probably already have a video-editing program. It may be
Windows Movie Maker, or it may have come on a disc with your camcorder.
These programs are kind of like bikes with training wheels—they get you where
you want to go, but you feel a little hobbled along the way.
At the other end of the spectrum are professional video-editing programs like Final
Cut Pro for the Mac and Premiere Elements’ big brother, Premiere Pro, for Win-
dows PCs. Pro programs cost a fortune, require serious computer horsepower, and
come with a steep learning curve.
Premiere Elements sits comfortably between the two. It doesn’t cost much—in
fact, you could easily spend more money taking someone to dinner. And you don’t
have to be a video technician to tap into the editing power it offers: Premiere Ele-
ments has a split personality. Use one set of tools, like InstantMovie or sceneline
editing, and you can whip a movie together in no time. It’s not just a bunch of
clips strung together, either. We’re talking about a movie with slick transitions,
major eye candy, DVD menus with theme-based graphics, and soundtracks with
balanced music and effects.
Use another set of tools, timeline editing, and you’re a lot closer to the profes-
sional video-editing suite. You build your own effects with multiple layers of video
and sound, and use keyframes to control the exact timing of special effects, motion
effects, sound effects, and the soundtrack. It takes more time, but that’s how you
create art.
What You Can Do with Premiere Elements
Using the aforementioned pencil and paper, you can create documents as diverse
as a play, a financial report, and a shopping list. You get the same diversity with
video and Premiere Elements. Someone in your family may capture weddings
and birthday parties, while another family member might carry on video corre-
spondence with far-flung friends. Aspiring actors and stand-up comics can create
video portfolios (archaically called “reels”). Musicians can capture rehearsals and
concerts and then, with Premiere Elements, turn them into their own MTV-style
music videos. Training videos, podcasts, school projects—video communication
can take an unlimited number of forms.
These days, a video-editing program does a whole lot more than assemble video clips
in sequence. Here are a few of the chores Premiere Elements handles for you:
• Move video clips from your camcorder to your computer. In the past, this very
first step often resulted in computer-crash frustration.
• Collect and import still photos, graphic art, music, and other media. Movies
are made up of more than just raw video clips.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Introduction
• Organize your media clips. After two or three years of shooting video and making
movies, keeping track of all that stuff becomes a major job. Premiere Elements
gives you the tools to find that needle in the haystack.
• Protect your media clips. Your raw video clips are like a still photographer’s
negatives. You don’t want them sliced, diced, damaged, or lost. No matter how
you use clips, Premiere Elements protects your originals.
• Analyze video clips to separate the good parts from the bad. Premiere Ele-
ments can identify footage that’s shaky, over-exposed, lacks contrast, and has
bad sound. Oh yeah, it can point out some of the good stuff, too.
• Find video with people. Is there a face in that clip? If so, Premiere Elements can
tag it, which means you can find it faster.
• Assemble video clips into a single movie. Finally, the basic “video-editing” task.
• Add transitions. You can apply dozens of different transitions to your movies.
Your audience may wish you didn’t have so many choices.
• Add special video and audio effects. Some effects fix less-than-perfect media
clips; others are there to dazzle the senses.
• Create picture-in-picture video. Sometimes, one picture isn’t enough to tell a
story. Just ask the producers of the TV drama 24.
• Add and balance music, narration, and sound effects. Premiere Elements can
automatically balance the sounds you add to your movie, or you can go in and
fine-tune it yourself.
• Convert your movie to different video formats. It seems that every website,
handheld device, and disc format wants a different type of video file.
• Share your movie with the world. From inside Premiere Elements, you can
send your video to DVDs, Blu-ray discs, computer files, or websites.
What’s New in Version 8
Even before Premiere Elements got to version 8, it had a bunch of modern fea-
tures, including support for high-definition camcorders and a video stabilizer to
help minimize shaky handheld shots. When it was time to show your masterpiece
to the world, you could export to DVDs, Blu-ray discs, or YouTube.
Here are some of Premiere Elements’ newer features:
• Elements Organizer. In the past, you organized your media clips on a panel inside
of Premiere Elements. Now, you use Elements Organizer. It’s the same standal-
one program that Photoshop Elements uses. The idea is you can manage, tag, and
organize all your media—video, audio, and stills—with a single program.

Introduction

Introduction
• Auto-Analyzer. A clever little tool that looks at your video clips frame-by-frame
and tags them, so you know what parts are good and what parts aren’t so good.
The Auto-Analyzer also divides long clips into scenes. You can have this utility
run in the background—a sort of set-it-and-forget-it option—or you can run it
manually when you need it.
• Auto Rendering. Premiere Elements imports a variety of video formats. Some of
them don’t provide flawless video playback as you work in the editor. In those
cases, Premiere Elements smoothes them out without any effort on your part.
• Effects Masking. You have lots of options when it comes to special effects. The
latest gee-whiz feature is the ability to apply a special effect to just a portion of a
video image.
• Face Tracking. Want to identify someone in a picture by name? You can create
a label and have that label follow the person around your video as you edit.
• Smart Mixing. Movies often have several tracks of audio—there’s the sound on
the video clips, there’s narration, and there’s music. With Smart Mixing, all you
have to do is tell Premiere Elements what should be in the foreground and what
should be in the background. Smart Mixing controls the audio levels so that all
the sounds are balanced.
• Additional Project and Sharing Presets. You don’t have to worry about the dif-
ferent file formats in the video universe. Why? Because Adobe has done your
homework for you. A single preset takes care of all the settings for frame sizes,
frame rates, aspect ratios, codec selection, and a bunch of other technical
details. Presets have been in Premiere Elements for a while. Version 8 includes
new ones for some of the newer camcorders and sharing options.
The Photoshop Elements Connection
The Adobe software family is huge, but Premiere Elements’ closest relative is
Photoshop Elements. These two programs are both consumer versions of profes-
sional products. That means they cost a lot less, and they’re a whole lot easier to
use than their hoity-toity brethren. If your video project uses still photos that need
a little tweaking and retouching, Photoshop Elements is the perfect tool for the
job. There’s a copy on your Premiere Elements DVD that you can use for 30
days—to use it longer, the folks at Adobe will gladly accept credit card payment.
Seriously, Photoshop Elements is pretty smart when it comes to your video
projects. It can create images that fit your video frame size, for example, so you
don’t have to do the math or wrestle with aspect ratios.
Both Elements programs use Elements Organizer to manage video, audio, and
photos. That makes for one-stop shopping when you’re looking for media to pop
into your movie.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Introduction
The Premiere Pro Connection
If Photoshop Elements is a sibling to Premiere Elements, then Premiere Pro is a
venerable ancestor. The very first version of Adobe Premiere arrived for the Mac-
intosh in 1991. Comparing that early version to today’s Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 is
like comparing a Stone Age hammer to the space shuttle (with apologies to Stan-
ley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke).
In contrast, Premiere Elements first appeared in 2004. From the beginning, it was
designed to repackage Premiere Pro for consumers. Each year, Adobe releases a
new version of Premiere Elements that adds features to keep pace with the ever-
changing video landscape. (If you’re doing the math, you may wonder how Adobe
got to version 8 so quickly. They skipped versions 5 and 6, so that Premiere Ele-
ments could numerically get in step with its older sibling, Photoshop Elements.)
Features such as the ability to handle new video formats, analyze video clips, and
work with audio, tend to appear first in Premiere Pro. Once they’re modified to
make them easy to use, they appear in Premiere Elements.
The Very Basics
You’ll find very little jargon or nerd terminology in this book. You will, however,
encounter a few terms and concepts you’ll see frequently in your computing life:
• Clicking. This book gives you three kinds of instructions that require you to use
your computer’s mouse or trackpad. To click means to point the arrow cursor at
something on the screen and then—without moving the cursor—to press and
release the left clicker button on the mouse (or laptop trackpad). To double-
click, of course, means to click twice in rapid succession, again without moving
the cursor. And to drag means to press the left button continuously on an
object and then move the cursor.
• Keyboard shortcuts. Every time you take your hand off the keyboard to move
your mouse, you lose time and potentially disrupt your creative flow. That’s
why many experienced computer fans use keystroke combinations instead of
menu commands wherever possible. Ctrl+C, for example, is a keyboard short-
cut for Copy in Premiere Elements (and most other programs).
When you see a shortcut like Ctrl+S (which saves changes to the current
project), it’s telling you to hold down the Ctrl key, and, while it’s down, type the
letter S, and then release both keys.
• Choice is good. Premiere Elements frequently gives you several ways to trigger a
particular command—a menu command or clicking a toolbar button or press-
ing a key combination, for example. Some people prefer the speed of keyboard
shortcuts; others like the satisfaction of a visual command available in menus or
toolbars. This book lists all the alternatives, but by no means are you expected
to memorize all of them.

Introduction
About The Missing Manual Series
Despite the many improvements in software over the years, one feature has grown
consistently worse: documentation. With the purchase of most software programs
these days, you don’t get a single page of printed instructions. To learn about the
hundreds of features in a program, you’re expected to use online help.
But even if you’re comfortable reading a help screen in one window as you try to
work in another, something is still missing. At times, the terse electronic help
screens assume you already understand the discussion at hand and hurriedly skip
over important topics that require an in-depth description. In addition, you don’t
always get an objective evaluation of the program’s features. (Engineers often add
technically sophisticated features to a program because they can, not because you
need them.) You shouldn’t have to waste your time learning features that don’t
help you get your work done.
The purpose of this book, then, is to serve as the manual that should have been in
the box along with your program. In this book’s pages, you’ll find step-by-step
instructions for every Premiere Elements feature, including those you may not
even quite understand yet, let alone mastered, such as mask effects, timeline key-
frames, and video codecs. In addition, you’ll find clear evaluations of each feature
that help you determine which ones are useful to you, as well as how and when to
use them.
Note: This book periodically recommends other books, covering topics that are too specialized or tan-
gential for a manual about Premiere Elements. Careful readers may notice that not every one of these
titles may be published by the Missing Manual Series’ parent, O’Reilly Media. While we’re happy to men-
tion other Missing Manuals and books in the O’Reilly family, if there’s a great book out there that doesn’t
happen to be published by O’Reilly, we’ll still let you know about it.
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual is designed to accommodate readers at
every technical level. The primary discussions are written for advanced-beginner or
intermediate computer users. But if you’re a first-timer, special sidebars called Up
to Speed provide the introductory information you need to understand the topic at
hand. If you’re an advanced user, on the other hand, keep your eye out for simi-
larly shaded boxes called Power Users’ Clinic. They offer more technical tips,
tricks, and shortcuts for the experienced computer fan. If you’re a fan of film as
art, watch for the Famous Movie Moments—quick notes about techniques used by
the medium’s auteurs.
Macintosh and Windows
While many of Adobe’s software products are available on both Windows and
Macs, Premiere Elements is not—it’s a Windows PC program. It’s a little tough
competing with Apple’s iMovie video editor. If you’re of the Mac persuasion and
interested in video editing, check out David Pogue’s iMovie ’09: The Missing Manual.

Introduction
About ➝ These ➝ Arrows
Throughout this book, and throughout the Missing Manual series, you’ll find sen-
tences like this one: “Open the Documents ➝Adobe ➝Premiere folder.” That’s
shorthand for a much longer instruction that directs you to open three nested
folders in sequence, like this: “On your hard drive, you’ll find a folder called Docu-
ments. Open that. Inside the Documents window is a folder called Adobe; double-
click it to open it. Inside that folder is yet another one called Premiere. Double-click
to open it, too.”
Similarly, this kind of arrow shorthand helps to simplify the business of choosing
commands in menus, as shown in Figure I-1.
Living Examples
As you read this book, you’ll encounter a number of living examples—step-by-step
tutorials that show you how to put together a practice movie using raw materials like
media clips and a half-completed project. You can download that raw material from
the Missing Manuals site. To get there, go to the Missing Manuals home page (www.
missingmanuals.com), then click the Missing CD link, then scroll down to Premiere
Elements 8: The Missing Manual, and then click the link labeled Missing CD.
Throughout Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual, you’ll find references to
websites that offer additional information and resources for media clips. You’ll
find a neat, chapter-by-chapter list of these sites on the same Missing CD page.
While you’re on the Missing CD page, you can find updates to this book; click the
link at the top of the page labeled “View errata for this book.” You’re invited and
encouraged to submit corrections and updates, too. To do so, click the link “Sub-
mit your own errata” on the same page.

Set Up a New Project
Premiere Elements calls the videos you create projects because, more likely than
not, you’ll include several types of media in your movies. Sure, your project will
include video clips, but you might also add narration, background music, still
images, text, and title screens. And when you export your video, you might want to
add a DVD menu to make navigating the final product easy. So, unlike a word
processing document or spreadsheet, your finished video comprises more than just
a single PC file—it’s a collection of different files sewn together into a whole.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to start a new project (as well as how to open an exist-
ing one). Along the way, you’ll tour the Premiere Elements workspace—the multifac-
eted screen where you organize clips, assemble videos, and add sound, transitions, and
special effects. At the end of the chapter, you’ll look at Premiere Elements’ Instant-
Movie feature—a tool that let’s you quickly turn video clips into finished movies,
perfect for YouTube aficionados. In addition, you’ll see how InstantMovie gives you a
great introduction to the basic steps of editing any video project.
Note: As you’re probably aware, this book is about Premiere Elements. In an effort to save a tree or two (not
to mention your patience as a reader), these pages will refer to the program simply as Premiere.
Start Premiere Elements
You start Premiere just as you would any other Windows program—which also
means you can do so in a couple of ways. Installing the program (a process
described on page 385) puts an Adobe Premiere Elements 8.0 shortcut on your
desktop, so the easiest way to start Premiere is to double-click that shortcut. That’s

14
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Start Premiere
Elements
fine the first few times you run the program, but you may not want the shortcut on
your desktop forever. An alternative way to launch the program is to add its short-
cut to Windows’ Quick Launch bar. Drag the shortcut from your desktop onto the
bar, and a purple “pre” icon appears there. Click it once to start Premiere.
Here are some other ways to start the program:
• From the Vista or Windows 7 Start menu, choose Windows ➝All Programs ➝
Adobe Premiere Elements 8.0.
• For Windows XP, go to Start ➝All Programs ➝Adobe ➝Adobe Premiere Ele-
ments 8.0
• If you’re a keyboard enthusiast, press the Windows key and begin to type premiere.
Before you finish typing, Windows searches for a match and displays a list with
programs at the top. Most likely, Premiere is at the top of the list and already
selected, so just press the enter key. Otherwise, use your mouse or arrow keys to
select and start the program.
Note: Adobe stores Premiere and all its supporting files with your other Windows programs. On most
computers, that location is C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements 8.0.
Every time you start Premiere, the program displays an introductory screen called
a “splash screen” (see Figure 1-1). It includes a “Create Adobe ID” web link to
Photoshop.com (see Figure 1-2). Click the link and enter your name and email
address to register your copy of Premiere, access Adobe’s online support, and get
some free storage space for your videos and photos (see the box on page 16 for the
details).
Figure 1-1:
Premiere Elements’ splash screen
offers help for new comers and
links to Adobe web-based
resources. There are only three
buttons that actually lead to the
Premiere Elements program.

Elements
If you’re connected to the Internet, don’t be surprised if the content in the main
part of the splash screen changes. From time to time, Adobe may put different
messages here, usually feeding you mini-tours of Premiere features or directing
you to Photoshop.com.
Note: Photoshop Elements is a program used to edit and retouch still photos. If you bought the DVD
version of Premiere Elements, Adobe included a trial version of Photoshop Elements on the disc. Both
programs use a third program, called Elements Organizer, to share photos and videos. Like any product
that tries to do two things, the Organizer has its quirks. For a full discussion of it, see page 99.
Once you get used to the splash screen’s layout, you soon realize that all the action
for video projects is in the three buttons on the left—they open Premiere and let
you start editing. Here’s the rundown:
• Organize. Opens Elements Organizer, which is a separate program you use to
keep track of all your videos and other media clips.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Should I Sign Up for Photoshop.com?
Whenever you fire up Premiere, its opening screen includes
links to Adobe’s Photoshop.com web services (see
Figure 1-2). Adobe provides a free basic membership with
2 gigabytes of storage for videos (about 20 minutes’ worth)
and photos, but its not-so-hidden agenda is to get you to
upgrade to a more robust membership, one with an annual
fee. So what do you get from Photoshop.com, and is it
worth any extra investment?
Adobe bases its subscription price on how much storage
you want. Here’s what you get with your free member-
ship and some notes on the additional benefits of a paid
subscription:
• Online storage and sharing for your photos and vid-
eos. Free membership: 2 gigabytes. Upgrade to one
of the paid memberships and, for $49 per year, you
get 20 gigabytes of storage. For $69, you get 40
gigabytes, and for $129, you get 100 gigabytes.
• Automatic back-up and synchronization. If you worry
about losing your digital photos and videos but
never get around to making back-ups, this is an
appealing feature. Photoshop.com automatically
backs up your files so you never have to worry
about them. The downside is that if you need more
than 2 gigabytes of space, you have to pay for the
storage. The $49 20-gigabyte membership lets you
store about four hours of DVD-quality video. As you
can tell by the prices listed above, if you shoot a lot
of video, storage can get expensive.
• Online management of photos for other websites,
such as Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, and Photobucket. If
you’re a member of one of these photo-sharing sites,
this feature works great. You can move photos from
Photoshop.com directly to any of those services. It
gives you a central place to manage your online
photo albums.
• Basic online training and tutorials. With a paid sub-
scription, you also get advanced tutorials. Online
training and tutorials are great, but if that’s all you’ll
use the site for, it probably doesn’t justify Photo-
shop.com’s annual fee. You can find free tutorials on
AdobeTV and even on YouTube. And you can find
professional-quality tutorials on sites such as O’Reilly
Media (www.oreilly.com) and Lynda.com.
• The free subscription includes some Premiere tem-
plates and themes. With a pay-to-play account,
Adobe makes even more themes and templates
available. Adobe automatically downloads these
resources to your PC.
The Bottom Line: For most Premiere Elements users, it
makes sense to sign up for the free, basic membership.
Explore the services and see if they’re valuable to you. As
the name Photoshop.com implies, the service was origi-
nally created for still photographers (Adobe Photoshop is
the tool of choice for editing still images) and, at this point,
still photographers are likely to see more benefits. Keep in
mind that the 2-gigabyte limit won’t get you, the video pro-
ducer, very far. After all, that’s equal to or less than the stor-
age provided by many tapeless video cameras. If you don’t
mind being responsible for your own backups, you could
put the $49 to $129 you’d spend on Photoshop.com toward
an external hard drive. Very good 500GB external hard
drives are available for well under $100.

A Brief Tour of Premiere Elements
Start Premiere and click the New Project button. Premiere asks you to name your
project and address a few other details, but for now, as you learn the layout of the
program, simply accept the project name that Adobe assigns (My Project.prel) and
click the OK button. That takes you to Premiere’s workspace, the place where you
edit your videos. It’s divided into three main areas, as shown in Figure 1-3.
• The Monitor panel plays back your video clips. Use the DVD-style buttons
below it to control playback.
• Think of the Tasks panel, to the right of the monitor, as your video-editing
toolbox. Select the task you want to tackle by clicking one of the tabs at the top
of the panel (Organize, Edit, Disc Menus, and Share). You’ll learn about each of
these a little later in this chapter.
• The My Project panel displays your movie-in-progress—the video and audio
assets you’ve assembled to create your movie. My Project offers two viewing
modes: the Sceneline view lets you assemble your movie by dragging clips into a
series of boxes, each of which displays a still image of the clip; and the Timeline
view looks more like a traditional video-editing tool, with a time scale along the
top and separate video and audio tracks below.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
A Brief Tour of
Premiere Elements
As you work in Premiere, you’ll find yourself jumping back and forth among these
panels. For example, to put together a video of a day in the Caribbean, go to the
Tasks panel and click on the Organize tab to review your clips. Select the clips you
want in your video, drag them to the My Project panel, and arrange them in the
order in which you want them to play back. Preview your draft movie in the Moni-
tor panel. Then move on to the other tabs in the Task panel to fine-tune your video,
add special effects, and create a disc or export it to a website.
The Monitor Panel
Think of the monitor as a TV screen where you play your clips as you assemble your
movie. No matter how great a cameraperson you are, you won’t use every frame of
every clip you shoot. Instead, you select the best shots using the monitor’s controls
(for details on editing clips, see page 141). Move back and forth within a clip using
the buttons and controls at the bottom of the panel (Figure 1-4).
Figure 1-4:
At the bottom of the
Monitor panel, you see
navigation and playback
control buttons. At first,
you may not recognize
all the buttons and their
uses, but soon using
them becomes second
nature as you jump back
and forth to different
spots in your video clips.

exactly where you are. If, as you edit, you know where you want to be in a clip, you
can drag the playhead right to that spot.
The Step Back and Step Forward buttons move you forward and backward
through your video a frame at a time—a great way to find the exact frame at which
you want to cut to another scene, add a transition, or select a single frame of your
video to export as a still image (to use as a DVD cover, for example).
The Rewind and Fast Forward buttons work just as they do on your DVD player.
Video projects are made up of more than just a single clip, of course. The point
where one clip meets another is called an “edit point.” Premiere uses these edit
points as navigational aids to help you move through your movie quickly. The “Go
to Previous Edit Point” and “Go to Next Edit Point” buttons move you along each
of the edit points in your movie.
The first 20 times you see a clip, you may be patient enough to watch it at normal
speed while you admire its cinematic beauty. Later, with a deadline looming,
you’re eager to zip to a particular point for editing. That’s when Premiere’s “shuttle”
control comes in handy. Shuttle lets you navigate through your video at variable
speeds—a favorite trick of experienced video editors. Drag the shuttle to the right
to move forward and to the left to move back. The further you drag the control
off-center, the faster you move through your video.
Tasks Panel
The Tasks panel is a bit of a chameleon—it looks different depending on which of
the four tabs—Organize, Edit, Disc Menus, or Share—you click (see Figure 1-5).
When you click a tab, a related set of tools appears in the panel below it. For most
video projects, you move from left to right across the tabs as you work toward a
finished product. Here’s a look at each of the tabs and their tools:
• Organize (click the tab itself or, from Premiere’s menu bar, choose Window ➝
Organize) is the natural first step for any project. Here, you transfer video clips
from your camera to your computer. It’s also where you first view your clips
and organize them by quality and content. You can drag video clips from here
to the sceneline, putting them into sequence, a process described in detail on
page 160.
• The Edit tab (Window ➝Effects) is usually the next step for your project. Once
you decide on your basic sequence of clips, it’s time to add special effects, tran-
sitions, and titles. Premiere also provides themes—predesigned visuals and
background music (“Road Trip,” “Outdoor Wedding”). Themes give you an
easy way to apply professionally designed wrappings to your project.

• Use the Disc Menus tab (Window ➝Disc Menus) to create an opening screen
and chapter divisions for movies destined for DVD or Blu-Ray discs. Again,
Adobe provides visuals, all you need to do is mark the scenes and chapters in
your movie. The end result is a slick, fool-proof menu and navigation system.
• Use the Share tab (Window ➝Share) to export your finished project. Premiere
makes it easy to burn videos and their menus onto a disc. If your video is
headed for the web, the Share tab streamlines the process of meeting the video
requirements for sites like YouTube and Photoshop.com.

A Brief Tour of
Premiere Elements
My Project Panel
The My Project panel stretches across the bottom of Premiere’s workspace. It gives
you two distinct views of your project: Sceneline and Timeline. The Sceneline view
lets you quickly piece together a video and work on it in broad strokes. The Timeline
view gives you granular control over your movie, letting you fine-tune every frame.
Sceneline mode (Figure 1-6, top) looks like a series of boxes. You drop video clips
into the boxes in the correct order to turn individual clips into a movie. You apply
transitions, like dissolves and wipes, in the small boxes between each clip (for more
on transitions, see page 175). The sceneline is similar to a storyboard, a tool film-
makers use to visualize their movies before they shoot any film. Typically, a story-
board is a series of drawings, where each drawing represents a scene or some
important shot in the movie.
Timeline mode (Figure 1-6, bottom) looks familiar if you’ve used other video-
editing programs. At the top of the panel, the timeline measures the length of your
movie and the position of the playhead, using a video “frame” as the basic unit of
measurement. Below that, horizontal bands hold video and audio tracks. You can
have multiples of each, giving you the ability to superimpose both images and
sounds. For example, the soundtrack for your movie might combine the audio you
recorded as you shot your video, along with narration, music, and sound effects.
You can put each of these components on separate tracks, giving you control over
their timing, volume, and other properties.

Create a New Project
Now that you’ve had a chance to noodle around Premiere’s workspace, it’s time to
officially start a new project. Here are the steps you take:
1. Click the Premiere icon in Windows’ Quick Launch bar or use the Windows
Start menu to launch the program.
Tip: Page 13 explains some of the different ways to start Premiere.
2. On the splash screen, click New Project.
Premiere displays a New Project window with boxes for the project’s name and
file location (Figure 1-7). Below that, “Project Settings” describes the project’s
video format, with the option to change it via the Change Settings button.
3. In the Name box, type a name for your project, such as My First Classic Movie.
You have to give each project a unique name. For most projects, this is the only
change you’ll ever make in the New Project window. You may never specify the
location of your saved projects or the technical details related to the Project Set-
tings. Still, it’s good to know what they’re for.
4. (Optional) To save your project to a new location, click the Browse button
beside the “Save In” box.
Initially, Premiere saves your projects in the folder the program itself resides in,
C:\Users\yourname\My Documents\Adobe\Premiere Elements\8.0. That’s fine if
you have enough room on your hard drive. But if you want to store your vid-
eos elsewhere, such as a dedicated hard drive, click the Browse button and navi-
gate to the new location. Then click OK and you’re all set.
Figure 1-7:
The most important
details when you create a
new project are the name
of your project and
where Premiere will store
the project. Once you get
rolling with video
projects, you may not
have to change the
settings that determine
the video size and
quality. You’re likely to
use the same settings
most of the time.

5. (Optional) To change the format of the movie you create—say from a standard-
resolution video using the 4:3 aspect ratio of TV sets to a high-definition wide-
screen format—click the Change Settings button.
A new window opens (see Figure 1-8) where you make a couple of technical
decisions based primarily on the type of video camera you use. If you don’t
know the answers to these questions off the top of your head, it’s a good time to
pull out the camera’s manual. It’s not missing, is it?
The first thing you need to figure out is whether your camera and TV set use
the NTSC or PAL video system. (In the U.S., nearly all video systems use the
NTSC format.)
Once you do that, you need to find out the video format your camera uses.
Your choices include an arcane alphabet soup of options like AVCHD, DV, and
HDV. Who needs that? The good news is that you should be able to find these
details on the cover or within the first few pages of your camera’s manual. (If
you need more help or want to dig a little deeper, see the box “Choosing Project
Settings” on page 25) After you change the settings to match your camera, click
OK to close the Project Settings window.
6. In the New Project panel, click OK.
The New Project window closes and you see the Premiere workspace, with the
three panels described on page 17.
Once you create a new project, you want to add clips to it. You do that from the
Organize tab in the Tasks panel. Under that tab, click the Get Media button. The
details of importing files for your video project appear in Chapter 2, but because
Figure 1-8:
The first time you use
Premiere, you need to
make sure the project
settings match your video
camera and your TV.
There’s a certain amount
of video jargon involved,
but once it’s set up, you
don’t need to mess with it
again unless your
equipment changes.

24
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Save and Back Up a
Project
you probably can’t wait to get started, click on one of the sources listed and import
a file or two so you see the process in action (if you don’t have a camera hooked up
to your PC just yet, browse to the folder that holds Premiere and click Clip Arts ➝
Common ➝ Nature and double-click the file named Palm Tree.png).
Save and Back Up a Project
Once you create a project, you need to know how to save it. As with most PC
projects, it’s wise to save early and often. That way, you won’t lose any of your
hard work if your PC freezes up mid-project. If your work is especially important
(or if you’re a chronic worrier), you may want to save duplicate or back-up copies
of your project.
Saving a video project is about the same as saving a word processing document. Go
to File ➝Save or press Ctrl+S. After a little hard disk action, Premiere saves your
file. To save a back-up copy, choose File ➝Save a Copy. The Save Project window
opens, where you can give your project a different name and navigate to a new save
location.
Note: Premiere projects are saved with the .prel file extension. So, for example, if you double click a file
in Windows Explorer that ends in .prel, Windows automatically starts Premiere and opens the project file
you clicked.
While the mechanics of saving a Premiere file are the same as those for a Word docu-
ment, the practical aspects are notably different. Here’s why: When you save a Word
document, you save everything associated with that document—words, embedded
pictures, graphs, and so on. When you save a Premiere file, you don’t save all the
video clips and sound files that make up your movie. If you did, your hard drive, no
matter how capacious, would fill up after a couple of movies—video and audio files
are notoriously huge. So Premiere, like most video-editing programs, creates a
project file that simply points to the appropriate sections of your original clips. A Pre-
miere project file, in other words, is essentially a collection of pointers.
By the same token, when you edit one of your video clips, you aren’t actually chop-
ping up the clip. You’re telling Premiere something like, “I want to use frame 122 to
frame 875 of the clip named mydayatthebeach.mp4. Premiere takes note of that and
displays only that portion of the clip in the Monitor panel. And, when you export
your finished movie, it copies just that portion of the clip to your movie file.
Because all the projects you create point to your raw video clips, you don’t want to
move, rename, or delete those original files. If you do, Premiere won’t be able to
find them the next time you open a project. For more details on the location of
your video files and projects, see the box on page 27.

Chapter 1: Set Up a New Project

UP TO SPEED
Choosing Project Settings
If Premiere’s alphabet soup of project settings confuses
you, here are some tips to help you make the right choices.
The good news is, once you choose the project settings for
your video equipment, you probably won’t have to mess
with them again.
When you choose settings, you select them from the Avail-
able Presets box on the left side of the Setup box (Figure 1-8).
You first choose a video standard, then you choose a video
preset (settings that tell Premiere how to turn videos into the
1s and 0s of a movie file). When you click one of the purple
preset icons to do so, Premiere displays the technical details
in the text boxes on the right.
Choose NTSC or PAL. Traditionally, the world is divided
into two major video camps. If you live in the Americas,
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and many other countries,
you’re on the NTSC team (NTSC stands for National Televi-
sion System Committee). If you live in Europe, Australia,
Russia, China, India, the Middle East, or Africa, your TV
probably uses the PAL (Phase-Alternating Line) system. The
two systems create color TV images in different ways, mak-
ing them incompatible with each other. Premiere can work
with either system, but you need to select the one that’s
compatible with your video camera and TV. In the Setup
window, under each of these systems, you see several
standard-definition and high-definition video formats.
Choose a video preset. It seems that electronics manufac-
turers create new video formats with each new lunar cycle.
Fortunately, you don’t have to understand all of them, you
just need to know which preset works with your camera
and TV. One of the main things the preset defines is the
quality, or resolution, of the video image. Video images, like
those on your computer screen, are made up of pixels
(short for picture elements).
People often refer to pixels as dots, but they’re actually rect-
angular or square. Resolution is defined as the number of
horizontal pixels by the number of vertical pixels. For exam-
ple a hi-def TV might have a resolution of 1920 × 1080.
There’s not enough room in this book for a complete descrip-
tion of all the video formats, but below is a quick rundown of
those you can use with Premiere. Adobe tries to make it easy
for you to choose the right format by roughly grouping them
by type of camera. So you should be able to match your cam-
era specs (like HDV 720p) with the format names listed
under “Description” in the Setup window:
• AVCHD. A trademarked high-definition video format
developed by Panasonic and Sony and used by other
companies as well. The format produces a 1080i-pixel
image compatible with today’s high-definition TVs.
There are two widescreen formats with different reso-
lutions: Full HD measures 1920×1080i pixels; HD is
1440×1080i. AVCHD supports two audio standards.
One is called “better than CD quality stereo;” the
other is the traditional 5.1 format. The 5.1 format
refers to how many speakers (the number before the
dot) and subwoofers (the number after the dot) make
up the compatible sound system. The 5.1 standard
includes a center speaker, two front and two back
speakers, and one subwoofer.
• DV. An earlier digital video format developed by
Sony, JVC, and Panasonic for their digital video cam-
eras. DV cameras store video on a variety of media,
but the MiniDV tapes developed for consumer and
pro camcorders are the most popular. Easy to shoot
and edit, DV video produces DVD-quality video. DV
resolution is 720 × 480 pixels. You can produce
either standard or widescreen video by changing the
DV camera’s aspect ratio.
• Hard Disk, Flash Memory Camcorder. Tapeless cam-
corders store video on hard drives or memory chips.
The actual video file formats are similar to some of
the other choices. For example, HD 1080i 30 is simi-
lar to AVCHD 1080i 30. The Standard and Wide-
screen formats are similar to the DV options.
• HDV. This is another high-definition format used to
record HD video on miniDV tapes. There are two
image formats: HDV 720p and HDV 1080i.

Tip: If you want to make back-ups of your raw video clips, you need to make copies using Elements
Organizer (page 136) or use traditional Windows back-up or file-copying techniques. Just make sure you
don’t move, delete, or rename the files your projects point to.
Avoid Disaster with Auto Save
Like a lot of programs, Premiere can automatically save your project on a regular
basis. That way, if the power goes out due to natural-, child-, or dog-borne disasters,
you’ve got a back-up. Premiere turns Auto Save on when you first install the pro-
gram. To review or adjust the settings, choose Edit ➝Preferences. In the list of top-
ics on the left side of the window that pops up, click Auto Save to tweak the
settings. Make sure the “Automatically Save Projects” box is checked and then, in
the “Automatically Save Every _ minutes” box, type in a number that matches
your comfort level. Premiere uses 20 minutes as the default. You may want to
change that to, say, 10 or 15 minutes if you’re feeling disaster-prone. Just under-
neath that setting, the Maximum Project box refers to how many versions you
want to back up. Five is a good number for most situations.
This way, if your computer crashes, the next time you start Premiere, it asks if you
want to open the last auto-saved version of your project.
Tip: While you have your Preferences window open, you may want to take a look at the Scratch Disk
preferences. Premiere stores temporary files, called scratch files, on your computer’s hard drive. You can
manage disk space and maybe get a little better video performance by tweaking these settings. For details,
see the box on page 28.
Open an Existing Project
After you create a project, you can open it from Premiere’s splash screen or from
the File command in Premiere’s menu bar at the top of the screen.
• To open a project from the splash screen (shown earlier in Figure 1-1), click on
the Open Project button. A list of recent projects appears under your cursor.
Click the name of the project you want to open.
• To open a project from Premiere’s File menu, choose File ➝Open Project. A
window named Open Project appears displaying the files in your Premiere Ele-
ments 8.0 folder. If you want, you can navigate to a different location to open a
project file.
• To open a project you recently worked on, choose File ➝Open Recent Projects.
Premiere displays a submenu with your last five projects listed. Click the name
of the project you want to open.

open at a time. The My Project panel displays your video clips arranged the way
you last saved them. Now you’re ready to continue editing your project.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Premiere and File Storage
Where Does Premiere Store Imported Files?
It’s not hard to figure out where Premiere saves your
project files because you can use File ➝Save As to see the
current location. (When you first install Premiere, it saves
your files in the Documents\Adobe\Premiere Elements\8.0
folder, though you can change that; see page 22.)
But what about the video clips that you import into Pre-
miere? Where does it stash those files? At first, Premiere
also saves them in your Documents folder, usually in sub-
folders named after the date you imported the clip. So
you’re likely to see a folder with a name like 2009 12 15.
You don’t have to settle for that location, however. You may
want to keep your clips on a different hard drive, where you
have plenty of room for big video files.
To change the save location of your imported Premiere files
(or if you just want to check where Premiere stores them),
go to Edit ➝Preferences and in the left-hand column click
“Scratch Disks”. Premiere displays a list of each type of file
in your project (“Video Previews”, “Disc Encoding”, and so
on) and its location, as you can see in Figure 1-9. The top
item: “Captured Video”, shows you where Premiere stores
your imported video clips. The second entry tells you where
Premiere saves your imported audio clips. The other items
in this list are work files that Premiere makes as you edit. To
change any of these locations, click the Browse button and
choose a new folder.

Impatient to put a video together so you can show off your family reunion or vaca-
tion highlights? That’s why Adobe created InstantMovie. InstantMovie analyzes
your video clips and makes basic editing decisions for you, so it’s a fast path to a
video that’s ready for prime time.
InstantMovie assembles the pieces for a 4- to 6-minute movie by asking you a few
easy questions along the way, and you have the opportunity to tweak your video at
the end of the process. The basic steps are:
• Select the video clips you want in your movie.
• Choose a theme.
• Decide how Premiere applies the theme elements.
• Premiere analyzes and “smart tags” the clips.
• Premiere assembles the clips.
• Premiere applies the theme elements.
• You preview the movie.
• You tweak the movie.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
The Tale of Scratch Disks
What’s a Scratch Disk and Why Do I Care?
As mentioned earlier, video files are big. No, they’re really,
really big, and that means they’re sometimes a challenge for
computers to handle. You’re jumping around choosing video
and audio clips here and there and you expect your com-
puter to keep pace with your snap decisions and to show you
accurate previews of your work. One way your computer
keeps track of your editing decisions is to create temporary
copies of a project’s files in an area on your hard drive called
a scratch disk. Usually, Premiere stores scratch files in the
same place it stores your project files, but that may not
always be your best choice, especially if you’re running out of
disk space. For that reason, you can tell Premiere exactly
where you want it to store scratch files using the Preferences
window. Choose Edit ➝Preferences ➝Scratch Disks to see
a list of the different types of scratch files Premiere uses. You
have three location choices for each file:
My Documents saves scratch files in your Documents
folder (usually on your C drive).
Same As Project saves scratch files in the same folder as
your Project files. Again, this is usually within your Docu-
ments or My Documents folder, unless you changed the
location.
Custom saves your scratch files in whatever location you
choose. This is a good choice if you have a second or third
hard drive with lots of room on it. Here’s why: You can store
the large scratch files on a disk that’s independent of the
drive that holds Premiere’s files. That way, Premiere doesn’t
have to compete for disk time to access both its program
files and the scratch files.
Speed tips: If you know that one of your hard drives is faster
than the others, store your captured video and scratch files
on the fastest drive. You can use slower drives for project
files and audio files. Try to use discs that are directly
attached to your computer. The connections to network
discs are sometimes too slow for video-editing projects.

2. Ctrl-click the video clips or assets you want in your InstantMovie.
Ctrl-click works like a toggle; it selects and deselects a clip with each click. Try
it; put your cursor on a clip and Ctrl-click. The perimeter of the clip turns blue
to indicate that it’s selected. Now Ctrl-click the clip again, and you deselect it—
the blue border disappears.
Shift-click selects all the clips between two clip selections. Shift-click on the first
clip in a sequence, then move your cursor to the last clip in the sequence, and
then shift-click again—you select all the clips between the first and last clip.
Ctrl+A selects all the assets in the Organize window.
3. In the lower-right corner of the Tasks panel, click the Next button.
The Tasks panel changes to the Edit tab, displaying Themes.
4. Select a theme.
You may need to use the scroll bar on the right to see all the themes. You can
also use the drop-down menu to display themes by category, such as Style,
Events, or Slideshow (see Figure 1-11). One of the Style themes, for example,
makes your movie look like a music video.
5. Click Next.
As shown in Figure 1-12, the Edit tab lists the components that make up Pre-
miere’s themes: Opening Titles, Closing Titles, Music, Speed and Intensity,
Duration, Sequence, Theme Content, and Render Preview. You can edit each of
them to fine-tune the way Premiere applies your chosen theme.
6. Premiere suggests an opening and closing title in the relevant boxes, but you
can edit it to say anything you want. You might, for example, change the
Opening Title box to read My First Classic, Directed by Sheer Genius.
7. Under Music, choose Theme Music.
If you like the music Premiere pairs with the theme, you don’t need to change
anything. If not, you have only two options: You can go without music, or you
can select a song from your own music files (Premiere doesn’t offer an alterna-
tive from its own music archive). To use a track stored on your computer, click
the Browse button to locate it.
Below the music choices, the Music/Sound FX slider balances the volume
between the music and the sounds recorded in your video clip. Drag the slider
to the left to make the music louder and the video clip softer.
8. Under Duration, choose Match Music.
When you choose Match Music, Premiere automatically makes the length of the
InstantMovie match the length of the music you selected. (If you chose No
Music, the Match Music option isn’t available.) If you choose Specify Duration,
you dictate the length of the movie. If you choose Use All Clips, the aggregate
length of the clips determines the length of your movie.

9. Under Sequence, choose Theme Order.
Adobe gives themes their own built-in rules for selecting and ordering video
clips. For example, when a theme wants to increase the level of excitement, it
may use lots of close-ups, with rapid cutting between clips. When you choose
Theme Order, you let Premiere use those pre-set rules. You can override them
by choosing Time/Date, which orders the clips temporally. For example, you
might want to choose the Time/Date option for a wedding video. That way, the
sequence of clips follows the sequence of events: groom arrives, bride walks
down aisle, vows taken….

10.Under Theme Content, you can include or exclude certain theme elements,
such as the Intro/Closing Movie, Transitions, Titles, and menus. Just check the
boxes you want to include.
11. Under Render Preview, click Yes.
After Premiere creates a video based on its and your choices, you get to preview
the results in the monitor. If a movie and its theme include lots of transitions
and special effects, the playback may be choppy. That’s because your computer
is trying to perform all the calculations necessary to coordinate the movie and
its soundtrack, transitions, and effects at the same time as it plays back your
video. When you “render” the preview, Premiere takes the time to perform all
those calculations up front. The result is smoother playback, with the rendered
preview looking like the final version of your movie. If you render the preview,
a progress bar appears to show the status of the rendering process.

12. Click the Apply button.
Premiere goes to work assembling your video and applying the theme elements
you specified. This can take a few minutes, depending on the length of the
movie and how powerful your computer is. First, Premiere analyzes the selected
clips using its Smart Tags feature (see page 120). This process helps Premiere
identify the best parts of a clip. When all the work is done, you see a movie in
the Monitor panel and a clip in the sceneline or timeline.
13. In the Monitor panel, click the Play button.
Your movie plays as shown in Figure 1-13. If you’re happy with it, go ahead
with the rest of the steps in this exercise. If you want to make changes, see “Edit

It displays several ways to share your video, including posting it online and saving
it to disc, to your PC, to your mobile device, or to tape.

or Apple’s QuickTime media player.
16.Choose MPEG and then click NTSC DVD Widescreen.
If your video clips aren’t in the widescreen format, you can choose the NTSC
DVD Standard or another format that suits your movie. You can find more
details about video formats on page 40.
17. In the File Name box, type in a name such as My First Classic and click the
Browse button to choose a save location.
Premiere automatically saves your videos in your Documents folder unless you
tell it otherwise.
18. Click Save.
Premiere renders your movie, creating a video file in the format you chose. A
progress bar shows you how far along the process is. Rendering a movie can
take some time, so you may want to grab a beverage of choice or check your
email while Premiere does its work.
Edit Your InstantMovie
The mark of a powerful Hollywood director is having “final cut” approval, the last
word on every aspect of a film. Premiere gives you that privilege right away, even in
InstantMovie. After all, directors and studio heads don’t always agree when it comes
to editing, and neither will you and Premiere. It’s good to be the studio big shot.
When Premiere creates an InstantMovie, it produces a single clip. If you want to
make changes, such as swapping a clip here or there, you need to break that clip
into pieces. Fortunately, Premiere automates the process.
Right-click the InstantMovie clip in the timeline or the sceneline and then choose
Break Apart InstantMovie in the shortcut menu. Premiere breaks the movie into
its basic parts, showing clips and special effects in the My Project panel.
Replace any of the clips by right-clicking on them in the timeline and choosing
Replace Clip From Media or Project. If the replacement clip is longer than the
original, Premiere trims it to fit. If the clip is shorter, a message warns you that the
clip’s too short.
Tip: The Replace Clip command is only available when you’re working in the timeline. It’s not available in
the sceneline.

Create an
InstantMovie
It’s a Wrap
The steps Premiere goes through to create an InstantMovie are similar to those you
take when you create your own movie. In fact, InstantMovie teaches you a lot about
assembling a movie and applying transitions and effects. For example, consider the
timing and video clip choices Premiere makes in assembling an InstantMovie.
Study the way it creates the opening and closing titles. Examine how Premiere
applies transitions and special effects to your clips.
In the following chapters, this book expands on each of these movie-making steps
and shows how you can add your own personal touches to your movies.
Hooray for Hollywood!
Famous Movie Moment: In 1878, photographer Eadweard Muybridge helped former California Gov-
ernor Leland Stanford win a bet that when a horse gallops, all four hooves leave the ground at the same
time. He used 12 stereoscopic cameras placed 21 inches apart to completely capture a horse’s stride. Even
though it’s more like time-lapse photography, this project is considered one of the stepping stones to the
invention of motion pictures. Think of what Muybridge could have done with your camcorder.

Import Your Clips
Before you can create a movie that will entertain friends and family, you need to
move your raw video clips from your video recorder to your computer. These
days, you shoot video with a slew of gadgets, including camcorders, digital cam-
eras, and cellphones. The technique for transferring raw footage to your computer
varies by device, but fortunately Premiere simplifies the process. Best of all, after
you import video a few times, it becomes second nature. This chapter is your road-
map to importing clips.
Chances are your finished masterpiece will include more than just video clips. You
may add music, narration, still photos, and other images. You need to import all
these media “assets,” but this chapter focuses on video. For details on importing
other media, see Chapter 3.
Video Camera Storage Methods
Digital video files are big, so big that storage and processing power have always been
issues when it comes to editing video on a PC. The good news is that personal com-
puters keep improving, sporting bigger hard drives and faster processors. If you
bought a computer in the last five years (stripped-down netbooks aside), odds are
it’ll run Premiere (see page 385 for Premiere’s system requirements).
At the same time, camcorders have evolved, too. Like all electronic gadgets, the
trend is toward smaller devices that hold more. New camcorders benefit from better
memory chips and advanced hard drive technology. As a result, video cameras are
smaller but hold more than ever before. But the best trend of all is in price: It costs
less to buy a camera that captures great-looking video than it ever has.

Video Camera
Storage Methods
Tip: You can find links to all the websites mentioned in these pages on this book’s Missing CD page at
www.missingmanuals.com.
Depending on their size and capabilities, video recorders use different storage
methods. Larger camcorders store digital video on tape cassettes. Camcorders that fit
in your hand store video on little hard disks, like the ones in laptop computers or
iPods. Minicamcorders, digital cameras, and cellphones store video on memory
chips. Look Ma, no moving parts! Depending on the device, these chips are either
permanently fixed in the device or removable (you can take the latter out and replace
them with a fresh memory card, perfect for vacations).
Here are the details of each of the storage methods:
• DV cassettes. Digital video cassettes come in different shapes and sizes, but the
two most popular are MiniDV cassettes and Digital8 cassettes. Not to be con-
fused with the ancient analog video cameras, these camcorders are 100 percent
digital. About the size of a matchbox, MiniDV cassettes are popular in pro and
consumer camcorders because they’re reliable, relatively cheap, and high-quality—
they give you a crisp video image. Depending on your camcorder, the cassettes
can store standard digital video (DVD quality) or high-definition video, called
HDV, which means its quality is similar to that of hi-def TVs and Blu-ray discs.
• Hard drives. Today’s hard drives are small enough to fit in a tiny camcorder,
yet store hours of digital video. And, with the hard drive built into the camera,
you won’t have to shell out more money to buy media, as you do with MiniDV
cameras.
With hard-drive-based cameras, you transfer video files directly from the cam-
era to your computer via a cable. These days it’s usually a USB cable, like the
one you use to connect most gadgets to your PC. The only issue is making sure
that Premiere and your PC can read the type of video files your camera stores.
(For more details on digital video formats, see the box on page 40.)
• Mini-DVDs. Some camcorders record directly to miniature digital video discs
(3-inchers, about the size of a drink coaster). The concept is that you pop the
disc out of your camcorder and into your DVD player or computer to view
your raw footage. But you should double-check your equipment for compati-
bility before you buy a mini-DVD camera. If your computer’s DVD drive has a
tray that pops out, it most likely can handle these little discs—the tray that holds
standard-size DVDs usually has a depression in it that accommodates the
smaller-size discs. If, on the other hand, you load your DVDs by pushing them
into a slot, as is the case with most Macs, small discs may not work (and they
may jam the drive). Bottom line: Check before you buy.
Note that before you can play a disc in your TV’s DVD player, you have to
“finalize” it, a process you can do in your camcorder. In addition, high-definition
AVCHD DVDs will only play in a Blu-ray disc drive.

Video Camera
Storage Methods
• Internal memory. There are lots of examples of video cameras that store digital
video directly onto memory chips inside the camera. In some cases, these cam-
eras also have slots for memory cards, as described below. Many web-friendly
minicamcorders (like the Flip line of cameras) plug directly into your com-
puter’s USB port, no cables necessary.
• Memory cards. Today, the most popular memory cards for still and video cam-
eras are SD (Secure Digital) cards and their higher-capacity siblings, SDHC
(Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity).
You may find tape- or hard-drive-based cameras that have slots for these cards.
• Your computer’s hard drive. You may have video clips stored on your hard
drive from previous projects, from friends, or from a webcam. Premiere can
snag these clips for your projects, too.
You can see examples of various camcorders in Figure 2-1. In addition to the
media type your camera records on, you need to consider the video format it
records in. For example, some hard-disk camcorders store video in the AVCHD
format, while others use MPEG-2. When you’re buying equipment, you want to
make sure everything works together. These pages won’t bore you with a technical
dissertation on the differences between video formats, but if you’re interested in
more info on the video formats Premiere uses, see the box on page 40.

Camcorders come in a

Video Format Alphabet Soup
Camcorders come in a bewildering number of digital video
formats as manufacturers try to outdo each other by
squeezing the best quality video into less space. Some for-
mats are more popular than others, but the important thing
to know is what format you’re buying. Sometimes the video
format’s name is written in big letters on the camera; other
times you have to dig out the manual to look up the speci-
fications. Manufacturers’ websites and sites like www.
bhphotovideo.com and www.crutchfield.com are also great
sources for technical specs. Just go to the site and search for
a specific camcorder model number.
These days, you can divide digital video into two camps:
standard and high-definition. Each format has a particular
resolution—the number of pixels used to create an image.
DV resolution is similar to what you see on DVDs, while
HDV’s is closer to HDTV’s resolution. Table 2-1 shows the
resolution for some of the most popular standards and
devices.
In addition to resolution, each video format determines
how the digital video file handles audio, how it translates
video information into the 1s and 0s of a digital file for the
PC, and how it compresses everything into smaller files. But
you don’t need to worry about that. You just need to make
sure that Premiere can import the video format your device
records, be it a camcorder, still camera, webcam, cellphone,
electronic keychain, pen-cam, or dog collar-cam.
Here’s a list with brief descriptions of the video formats Pre-
miere understands. The letters in parentheses show you
the file extension of each format.
• Adobe Flash (.swf). A video/animation format
often used on websites.
• AVI Movie (.avi). A video format Microsoft Win-
dows uses for digital video.
• AVCHD (.m2ts, .mts, .m2t). Used by hard disk,
DVD, and memory-card camcorders to store high-
definition video.
• DV Stream (.dv). Used to record video to MiniDV,
Digital8, and other types of video tape.
• Filmstrip (.flm). Used by Premiere to output video
as a sequence of individual frames.
• MPEG Movie (.mpeg, .vob, .mod, .mpe, .mpg,
.mpg, .m2v, .mpa, .mp2, .m2a, .mpv, .m2p, .mlv,
.mp4, .m4v, .m4a, .aac, .avc, .264). MPEG stands
for Motion Picture Experts Group—an organization
that defines video standards. There are several
MPEG video file formats, as you can tell by the list
above. Some represent standard video and others
are high-definition formats.
• QuickTime Movie (.mov, .3gp, .3g2, .mp4, .m4a,
.m4v). Developed by Apple for playing video on the
Mac, but you can also get a QuickTime player for
Windows.
• TOD (.tod). A high-definition video format used by
JVC camcorders.
• Windows Media (.wmv, .asf). Formats used by
Windows, often to send video over the Internet.

Getting video from your camera into you computer used to be quite a hassle, but
with Premiere it’s just a matter of a few clicks and a bit of a wait. As shown in
Figure 2-2, go to Premiere’s Organize tab and click the Get Media button. The
Organize panel displays icons for different types of video devices. Click the icon for
your gadget, and Premiere uses one of two tools to import video clips to your com-
puter: the Capture panel (Figure 2-3) or the media downloader (Figure 2-4). In
general, tape-based camcorders and webcams use the Capture panel. Hard disk
camcorders, DVD camcorders, and memory-based devices use the media down-
loader. Table 2-2 shows which gadgets use which tool.
Tip: You can also add footage by choosing File ➝Get Media From and then choosing your source. The
menu lists all the media options shown in Table 2-2.

Tour the Capture Panel
When you import video using the Capture panel, you use a process called device
control, which means that your PC and Premiere take control of your camcorder or
other device. The capture panel looks like a TV monitor with DVD-type naviga-
tion buttons at the bottom (Figure 2-5). You control the device in Premiere, using
the fast forward, rewind, and play buttons to navigate to specific portions of your
stored video. When you click the red Capture button, Premiere records that video
to files on your PC. When Premiere finishes, you can disconnect your camcorder,
and Premiere uses the computer files to edit and create your movies. Here’s how to
use each of the features in this panel.
Capturing source
At the top of the window, the label “Capturing Source” appears beside a drop-
down menu where you select your source device. For a webcam or something similar,
you also see an Audio menu where you can select a sound source. When you hook
a camcorder up to your PC, the source is usually set to Microsoft DV and VCR. In
most cases, Premiere can use generic device control settings to communicate with
your camcorder. The Capture button starts and stops the capture process. Be
patient—device control isn’t always an instantaneous process.
Tip: If Premiere and your camcorder aren’t talking to each other, try manually setting up your capture
source as described on page 49.
Figure 2-4:
The media downloader doesn’t let you import a
portion of a clip; it’s an all-or-nothing
proposition. However, if your hard disk, memory
device, or PC folder has several clips, click the
Advanced Dialog button to choose the clips
you want.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

Capture settings
A sidebar with capture settings appears on the right side of the window. You can
collapse and expand this sidebar by clicking the small triangle button. Collapsing
the sidebar lets you see the video in the entire window, as shown in Figure 2-3. You
may not need to change any of the capture settings, but if you want, you can
rename your video clips and choose where to store the files. Checkboxes let you
choose to capture video and audio separately. If you assemble your project as you
go along, turn on the “Capture to Timeline” checkbox so Premiere automatically
adds imported clips to your open project’s timeline.
Premiere offers two ways to split the video stream into individual clips: by content
or by timecode. If you choose timecode, Premiere makes note of the times you
stopped and started the camera as you shot video. If you choose content, Premiere
guesses where to split the video stream based on the image; it examines the objects
or faces in the image and notes major shifts in light and in the background. At the
bottom of the settings, you can turn on and off specific aspects of Premiere’s
smart-tagging feature. (You’ll learn all about the Auto-Analyzer and smart tags in
Chapter 4, but for now know that they describe the quality of your video clips,
using labels like Low Volume, In Focus, and Shaky. Premiere uses this informa-
tion when it creates InstantMovies, and you can use it when you select clips for a
project.)
Navigation buttons
The capture panel’s navigation buttons look much like the ones on a DVD player.
In addition to the usual play/pause, fast-forward, and rewind buttons, there are
also buttons that let you move through your video a frame at a time (Figures 2-5
and 2-6). The Shuttle tool lets you move through the video at variable speeds—the
further you push the shuttle to the left, the faster the video plays. Don’t forget the
two buttons on the far left, which jump to the previous and next scenes or clips.
Click the red Capture button to start copying video to your PC, and then click the
same button to pause the capture process.
Import Digital Video Tape Files (DV or HDV)
Importing raw video from a tape-based camcorder (MiniDV or Digital8) takes a
few steps. You connect your camcorder to your PC using a FireWire or USB cable.
Then use your PC and Premiere to control the camcorder. You can fast-forward
and rewind the tape to find a specific clip you want to import, or you can import
lots of clips at once. Either way, Premiere saves the clips on your computer and
then runs the Auto-Analyzer to apply smart tags (page 120) based on the quality of
the video. The entire process is pretty much the same whether you import stan-
dard DV or HDV video clips.

Chapter 2: Import Your Clips

Add Raw Footage
Here are the steps:
1. Plug your camcorder into an outlet and turn it on. Set it to Play, VTR, or VCR
mode, which lets your PC recognize your camcorder.
You can run your camcorder off of its battery when you import video, but why
risk the battery going dead before you finish?
2. Connect your camcorder to your PC.
Your camcorder connects to your computer using either a FireWire or a USB 2.0
cable. For details about the type of cable and connections, see page 51. If your
camcorder is properly powered up and plugged in, you’ll probably hear a lovely
tone when your PC recognizes the newly connected device.
3. Start Premiere.
Choose either New Project or Open Project as described on page 16.
4. In the Tasks panel, click the Organize tab.
It displays any media already in your Organizer catalog (see page 101). You see
several buttons at the top of the panel, including Get Media.
Figure 2-5:
There’s a lot going on in

5. Click Get Media.
The Tasks panel displays several icons showing devices that hold raw video files,
like “DV Camcorder” and “DVD (Camcorder or PC DVD Drive)”.
6. Click DV Camcorder (or HDV Camcorder, if that’s what you have).
The capture panel appears, as shown in Figure 2-5. You’re in device control
mode, which means that Premiere and your PC are controlling your cam-
corder’s playback. At the top of the Capture panel, the Capturing Source drop-
down menu probably displays “Microsoft DV Camera and VCR”. Below, a
message reports the device’s status—Stopped, for example, when you’re not
rewinding or playing your camcorder’s video. If it doesn’t seem like your com-
puter and camcorder are communicating, go on to the next step. Otherwise,
skip to step 8.
7. If necessary, click the Capturing Source drop-down menu and select your cam-
corder or device.
These days, camcorders and Premiere are pretty good at talking to each other,
so this step is becoming less and less necessary. Under the Capturing Source
menu, Premiere displays a message about the current status of the connected
device. A message like Stopped, Paused, Capturing, or Playing means your cam-
corder is connected and all is well. If the camcorder and computer aren’t talk-
ing to each other, you’re likely to see something like “Capture Device Offline”
or “No DV camera detected.” If you’re having trouble, consult the steps in the
box on page 49.
8. In the Clip Name box, type in a name, like Amy’s 16th Birthday Cake.
You can use any name, but make it descriptive enough so that you’ll recognize
it two years from now when you’re rummaging through your clips.
Tip: If the capture window’s sidebar is closed, you won’t see the Clip Name box or the other sidebar set-
tings. Click the tiny triangle to expand and collapse the sidebar (Figure 2-6).
9. (Optional) Click the “Browse for Folder” button and choose a location.
Premiere automatically stores your imported clips in the location specified in
Edit ➝Preferences ➝Scratch Disks ➝Captured Video. You can choose a differ-
ent location using “Browse for Folder”.
10.(Optional) Choose “Capture to Timeline”.
Turn this option on and Premiere automatically adds imported clips to the next
open spot in your project’s timeline (see page 156).

Chapter 2: Import Your Clips

11. (Optional) Turn on Split Scenes and then choose Timecode or Content.
When you import digital video from a tape-based camcorder, Premiere automati-
cally checks the time stamp on the video stream. It breaks up your video where it
detects that you started and stopped the camera. If you prefer, you can choose
Content, to make Premiere look for changes in the image and create scenes based
on what’s in the image. For an explanation of timecode, see page 50.
12. Select Auto-Analyzer and Analyze All.
The Auto-Analyzer checkbox appears in the sidebar. When you turn it on, Pre-
miere applies smart tags to clips after it imports them. Click the Analyze button,
and you can choose which smart tags to apply. Here are the options: Motion,
Faces, Blur, Brightness and Contrast, Shake, Audio, and Object Motion. (For
more on the Auto-Analyzer, see page 120.)
13. Use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the capture panel to find the
beginning of the clip you want to import.
The navigation buttons (Figure 2-7) work as they do on most DVD or media
players. The two buttons at the far left let you jump from one scene (video clip)
to another. If you want to jump to an exact location and you know the time and
frame, you can click the timecode numbers and type in a new time (see page 50
to learn how to interpret timecodes).

Tip: There’s a quick and easy way to jump to a new time in the Capture window. It’s called scrubbing,
and you can use it throughout Premiere to change numerical settings. When you hold your cursor over
the timecode, the cursor changes to display two arrows. Drag to the right to increase the number; drag left
to decrease it.
14. Click the red Capture button.
The video starts playing in the capture panel. A red line around the video indicates
that Premiere’s capturing video and recording it to your PC. If your camcorder has
an LCD viewing screen, you probably see the video displayed there, too.
15. When you reach the end of the clip you want to capture, click Stop.
As Premiere imports your video, the capture button turns into a stop button.
Click it and Premiere stops recording (and playing back) the video.
Premiere analyzes the captured video and applies smart tags to it. Later, as you
edit your project, the smart tags describe the quality of your clips (for more
detail on smart tags, see page 120).
Tape-based camcorders have a lot of advantages. For example, MiniDV tapes are
affordable, reliable, and easy to store as backups. During a long video-recording
session, you can always pop in a new tape and keep working. Furthermore, for
technical, video-compression reasons, the image on DV tape is often better than
video stored other ways. The biggest negative about DV tape camcorders is that
you have to fast-forward or fast-reverse to find individual clips on the tape, while
hard disks, memory chips, and DVD camcorders can jump directly to any bit of
stored video.
Import multiple scenes from tape
One MiniDV tape holds about an hour of standard video. If you’ve got room on
your hard drive, you may want to import most or even all the scenes on the tape.
Figure 2-7:
The capture panel is a

You use the DVD-style
controls to find clips, and

Set up your PC and computer to capture video as described in the steps beginning
on page 44. Rewind your camcorder to the beginning of the tape and then click
Capture. Then you can take a walk around the block or do anything else that takes
about an hour. Premiere records the video as your camcorder plays it, but rather
than create one big video clip, it breaks the clip into scenes. For example, Premiere
can tell when you stopped and started the camcorder, and it uses those breaks to
start and end scenes.
Manually set up your capture source
Most of the time, Premiere can use generic settings to communicate with video
camcorders and other capture sources. If Premiere and your camcorder don’t want
to talk to each other, first try the fixes described in the box above. If those steps
fail, you can try setting up your capture source manually in Premiere’s preferences
settings:
1. Choose Edit ➝ Preferences ➝  Device Control.
The Preferences window opens with the Device Control settings selected.
2. Click the Options button.
The DV/HDV Device Control Settings window opens (Figure 2-8).

Troubleshoot Your Camcorder Connection
If your computer and camcorder aren’t playing well
together, you can try a few simple steps to bring about
peace and cooperation.
1. Turn off your camcorder.
2. Double-check the cable connection. It may help to
unplug and then re-plug the connectors on both
ends. You may also want to use a new cable, in case
you’ve got a bad one.
3. Turn your camcorder back on.
4. Make sure the camera is in Play, VTR, or VCR mode.
As simple as it sounds, those steps may be enough to
reestablish rapport between the two machines. If that fails,
you can try a more elaborate version of the on/off fix:
1. Turn your camcorder off.
2. Save your Premiere work and other work you may
have in progress.
3. Restart your computer.
4. Start Premiere, but avoid running additional pro-
grams. (C’mon, you can live without iTunes for a few
minutes.)
5. Double-check your cable connection.
6. Turn your camcorder back on, making sure it’s in
Play, VTR, or VCR mode.
7. Click the Organize tab and Get Media button and try
again.
If these steps don’t solve your problem, you can try manu-
ally setting up your capture device, as described below.

3. In the Video Standard drop-down menu, choose NTSC or PAL.
Choose the video system that matches your camcorder and TV. (For more
details on the NTSC and PAL video systems, see page 25.)
4. Use the Device Brand drop-down menu to select the maker of your camcorder.
For example, choose Sony, Canon, or JVC.
5. In the Device Type drop-down menu, select the model number for your camera.
The menu contains a generous number of models for most popular camcorder
manufacturers. If you can’t find your model, you can experiment by choosing

How to Read a Video Timecode
As you work with video clips, you’ll notice that Premiere dis-
plays clip duration in an odd way, as a series of numbers
separated by semicolons. That’s called a timecode. Here’s
how it works. The timecode represents time in the format
hours;minutes;seconds;frames. For example, 02;34;16;22
translates to 2 hours, 34 minutes, 16 seconds, and 22
frames. Why such an exacting number? As you edit a
project, you often want to cut scenes and add transitions at
very precise locations. Timecodes describe those locations
down to the smallest increment possible for video editing—
a clip’s frame number. Write down a timecode as you
review a clip, and you can go back to that exact location to
add a cut or transition.
Video captured according to the NTSC standard—the one
used in North America and Japan—records video at about
30 frames per second (technically, it’s 29.97). The PAL for-
mat—used in Europe and a few other places—records 25
frames per second (fps). For more details about the two
video systems, see page 25.
Figure 2-8:
As a last resort, if Premiere doesn’t recognize your camcorder or
video device, you can manually change the Device Control
Settings. Here the device is defined as a Sony DCR-TRV-900
camcorder. The Check Status setting shows that the camcorder
is online and communicating.

6. Leave the Timecode Format set to Auto Detect.
The two choices on the drop-down menu are Non–Drop Frame and Drop
Frame, and they relate to the way the PC records video frames in the file. In
most cases, Premiere can detect which method your PC uses.
7. Click the Check Status button.
You should see the word Online next to the Check Status button if your cam-
corder or device is connected, turned on, and set to Play, VTR, or VCR mode.
8. Click OK.
The Device Control Settings window closes.
9. Click OK.
The Preferences window closes, and you’re back at the capture panel ready to

How to Connect Your Camcorder and PC
Two kinds of cables connect camcorders to PCs: FireWire
and USB. Your computer and camcorder may have one or
both of these connections. The only “gotcha” is that your
computer and camcorder have to use the same type of con-
nection: FireWire to FireWire, or USB to USB. Generally,
Firewire is used with tape-based camcorders while USB is
used for memory, disc, or hard drive camcorders.
FireWire is also known as i.Link by Sony or its catchy tech-
nical specification IEEE 1394a. FireWire cables may have a
small connector on one end and a large one on the other.
Typically, you plug the large end into your PC and the small
end into your camcorder. The socket on your camcorder
may be labeled FireWire, i.Link, or DV IN/OUT.
FireWire 800 (a.k.a IEEE 1394b) is a new, improved ver-
sion of FireWire that sends data even faster. It’s used on
new Macintosh computers and has different connectors
than the older version. (They always manage to make it dif-
ficult, don’t they?) At the time this was written, it was hard
to find camcorders using FireWire 800. The older FireWire
connection is fast enough to transfer video between cam-
corders and PCs. However, if you find yourself in a bind—
for example, with FireWire 800 on your PC and FireWire
400 on your camcorder—you can find cables and adapters
to convert one end to make the connection.
USB 2.0 is the standard USB (Universal Serial Bus) connec-
tion you find on most computers made since 2002. As with
FireWire, USB connectors can be big or small, so make sure
you get a cable with a small connector that matches your
camcorder and a larger connector that plugs into your PC.
Beware: Some really old computers use USB 1.0, which
doesn’t operate fast enough for video work. You can
upgrade such a computer with a new USB 2.0 card, but
chances are the other parts of the PC won’t be up to speed
for video editing or Premiere Elements 8.
Whether you connect via a FireWire or USB cable, your
computer usually makes some sort of sound when it recog-
nizes a newly connected device. The first time you connect
the camcorder and your PC, you may see a message
explaining that Windows is finding and installing a driver
(providing your PC is tapped into the Internet, that is). That
means Windows is automatically getting a mini-program
that helps your computer and camcorder talk to each other.

Import Webcam Video
Webcams are simple audio/video recorders that you often find built into laptops—
but you can attach one to any PC with a USB cable, too. Their lens and mic are
basic quality, but what do you expect for $40? Webcams make fine Internet video-
phones, which is what folks usually use them for. Still, Premiere is more than
happy to use them as a video source.
1. Make sure the webcam is plugged in and turned on.
Webcams that connect via a USB cable are powered on when you connect the
cable. If you have a built-in webcam, turn it on using its control panel.
2. In the Tasks panel, click the Organize tab.
The Organize tab displays any media already stored in your project. At the top
of the panel, you see several buttons, including Get Media.
3. Click Get Media.
The Tasks panel displays several icons showing devices that hold raw video files,
such as “DV Camcorder” or “DVD (Camcorder or PC DVD Drive)”.
4. Click “Webcam or WDM Device”.
The Capture panel opens (Figure 2-9). Your webcam is probably already
selected as the Capture Source and the Audio Source. If everything is working
properly, you’ll see an image in the Capture panel monitor even though you’re
not actually capturing the video stream yet.
Note: The term “WDM Device” refers to the Windows Driver Model—a system for connecting gadgets to
Windows PCs.
If your webcam isn’t showing as the Capture Source and you don’t see an image
in the capture panel’s monitor, click the drop-down menu and choose your
webcam from the list. (If the list doesn’t include your webcam, try the trouble-
shooting options in the box on page 49.)
Webcams use small programs called drivers to communicate with your com-
puter. The first time you connect your webcam to your computer, Windows
guides you through the process of installing the drivers.
5. In the Clip Name box, type in a name, like Webcam Address to Nation.
You’re welcome to use a more creative or meaningful name.
6. (Optional) Click “Browse for Folder” and choose a location.
Premiere automatically stores your imported clips in the location specified in
Edit ➝Preferences ➝Scratch Disks ➝Captured Video. You can choose a differ-
ent location now using “Browse for Folder”.

7. (Optional) Select Capture to Timeline.
With this option, Premiere automatically drops imported video in the next
open spot in the editing timeline.
8. (Optional) Turn on Split Scenes and choose Timecode or Content.
When you import digital video from a tape-based camcorder, Premiere auto-
matically watches your video stream’s time stamp. It breaks up your video
where it detects that you started and stopped the camera. If you prefer, choose
Content, and Premiere looks for changes in the image and creates scenes based
on when the image changes significantly.
9. Select Auto-Analyzer and Analyze All.
The Auto-Analyzer checkbox appears in the sidebar. When you turn this fea-
ture on, Premiere applies smart tags to clips after it imports them. Click the
Analyze button, and you can choose which smart tags to apply. Your options
are Motion, Faces, Blur, Brightness and Contrast, Shake, and Audio. For more
on smart tagging, see page 120.
10.Click the red Capture button.
Premiere begins to capture video and displays a red line around the video image
as a signal that it’s capturing the video.
11. When you finish capturing video from the webcam, or if you want to pause,
click the Pause button beneath the video image.
When you click Pause, the Capture panel goes into standby mode. Premiere ana-
lyzes the video (and applies smart tags if you turned that feature on in Step 9).
You still see the video image, but there’s no longer a red line around it. To restart
the capture, just click Capture again. If you’re finished, go on to the next step.
12. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the Capture panel.
The Capture panel closes. If you chose Split Scenes or Smart Tagging, Premiere
takes a few moments to analyze your clips before displaying them in the Orga-
nize tab.
Capture Time-Lapse or Stop-Motion Video
Most of the time, you want to create videos that represent real time—2 minutes of
video is the same as 2 minutes in the real world. On the other hand, you can create
some entertaining, time-bending effects with time-lapse or stop-motion video.
Time-lapse video is where 2 minutes of video may cover 12 hours’ worth of events
in the real world, like movies where clouds zip rapidly across the sky or flowers
open to full bloom in a matter of seconds. Stop-motion video makes seemingly
inanimate objects, like rocks, scoot around or jump from one spot to another
(think Wallace and Gromit or Mr. Bill). Some video cameras let you create time-
lapse or stop-motion video, but if yours doesn’t, you can create these effects when
you capture camcorder or webcam video in Premiere.

Capture previously recorded video as time-lapse video
In time-lapse video, you record a few frames at regular intervals and put them in a
video clip. When you play back the clip, you see a compressed version of time.
There are two critical settings that control the action—frequency and duration.
For example, if you want to capture clouds moving in the sky, snagging 1 second of
video every 5 minutes shows smooth, steady motion. If you want to monitor the
activity at your bird feeder, 5 or 10 seconds every 10 minutes captures individual
birds’ motion better. Usually, it takes some test-runs to find the right formula for a
particular event. Follow these steps to create a time-lapse video from a video you
took with your camcorder:
1. Connect your camcorder to your PC and turn it on in Play, VTR, or VCR mode.
For more details on connecting your camcorder for use with the Capture window,
see page 44.
2. In the Tasks panel, click the Organize tab and then choose Get Media.
The Organize tab shows the different devices you can choose to import video.
3.  Click DV Camcorder.
The capture panel opens. Make sure Capturing Source is set to “Microsoft DV
Camera and VCR”.

The program creates your time-lapse video from the captured images. The Capture
window closes, and you’re back on the Organize tab.
Capture live video as time-lapse
You can capture new video as a time-lapse video clip as you record it live with a
webcam or a camcorder. The process is nearly identical to the one for previously
recorded video. Instead of capturing frames from the video tape, Premiere cap-
tures frames from the connected camera. Follow the steps starting on page 54, but
in Step 1, instead of putting your camcorder in Play, VTR, or VCR mode, turn it
on in Camera or Record mode and start shooting. The rest of the steps are the
same, except that Premiere uses the live image as a source rather than previously
recorded video.
Figure 2-11:
Use the Set Time panel to set the interval frequency
and duration for time-lapse video. If you want to
capture smoother motion, keep the duration short,
about 1 to 5 seconds.

Capture stop-motion video
Stop motion works much like a still camera, capturing frames when you click Cap-
ture. Here’s how you can use it to make a stop-motion video of a tricycle moving
itself across a driveway: Put the trike on the driveway. Capture a few frames of
video. The camera stops. Move the trike a couple of inches. Capture a few more
frames. Continue on until the trike completes its journey. (Of course, you have to
have a laptop or some way to get your PC out into the driveway.)
Here are the complete steps needed to capture stop-motion video with Premiere:
1. Connect your camcorder to your PC and turn it on in Camera or Record mode.
For more details on connecting your camcorder for use with the Capture panel,
see page 51.
2. In the Tasks panel, click the Organize tab and then choose Get Media.
The Organize tab shows the different devices you can choose to import video.
3.  Click DV Camcorder (or Webcam).
The Capture panel opens. The Capturing Source should be set to “Microsoft
DV Camera and VCR”.
4. To the right of Capturing Source, select Stop Motion.
Radio buttons let you choose either Full Motion (the standard video capture
mode) or Stop Motion. As shown in Figure 2-10, a button appears in the video
monitor that says Create New Stop Motion and the instruction “Drag existing
clip here to continue”. New settings appear below the video image: Time Lapse,
Set Time, and Delete Frame.
5. Click Create New Stop Motion.
The monitor shows the video from your camcorder.
6. Arrange the scene the way you want.
Now’s when you position the trike on the driveway.
7. Click Grab Frame.
Premiere captures video and then stops.
8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 until you capture the complete scene.
Keep changing the scene and capturing frames until you’re happy with your video.
9. Click Preview.
Premiere Elements goes into preview mode, and you see the captured frames
playing in the monitor. It goes by pretty quickly if you only have a few frames of
video. If you want to see it again, click Play.

10.Turn off Preview.
Remove the checkmark from the Preview box, and you’re back in Capture
mode.
11. (Optional) Turn on Onion-Skinning.
Onion-skinning is a preview tool. It shows more than one captured image at a
time by making the images semi-transparent and superimposing them over
each other. This doesn’t change your movie clip, you only see this effect as you
preview and capture frames. You use onion-skinning to make sure one frame is
aligned with the next. (For details see the box.)
12. When you’re done with your Stop Motion video, click the X in the upper-right
corner.
A dialog box asks “Do you want to save the captured images as a movie file.”
13. Click Yes.
Premiere saves the clip, and you can find it with the others in the Organize tab.
You can use the clip just like any other video clip. If you click No or Cancel, the
clip isn’t saved.
Tour the Media Downloader
The media downloader is the tool for you if your camcorder stores video on
DVDs, hard disks, or memory chips. If you want to capture all the video on your
camcorder, you can use the media downloader as it appears in Figure 2-4. If you
want to pick and choose the clips you import, click the Advanced Dialog button in
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Onion-Skinning to See Multiple Frames
Do I need onion-skinning? I don’t even like onions.
Onion-skinning is a tool used in video and animation pro-
grams that superimposes one frame over another as you
work. The effect looks like a double-exposed photograph.
Onion-skinning is only a preview effect. It doesn’t change
the look of your finished clip, but it can be helpful when you
try to align multiple frames in stop-motion or time-lapse
video. For example, you may want to make sure all the
objects remain in place as you move one object, say a tricy-
cle. If everything is going according to plan, you should see
more than one trike superimposed in the image, while all
the other objects stay in place. In Premiere, you turn on
onion-skinning with the checkbox in the lower-right corner
of the capture panel.
If you find onion-skinning helpful for your project, you may
want to tweak the preferences so it works even better. In the
upper-right corner of the capture window there’s a button
that opens the Capture panel menu (See Figure 2-12).
Choose Stop Motion Preferences from the menu, and you
see three boxes where you can make adjustments. Normally,
onion-skinning superimposes three images: the current, the
previous, and the next. You can change this number in the
Number of Skins box. In the example, where the tricycle
moves across the driveway, suppose you want to see more
of its path. To see more onion-skinned images, first set the
opacity to a lower number—it starts out set to 50 percent.
Then increase the number of skins. The Playback box sets the
rate for number of frames displayed per second.

the lower-left corner, and the media downloader expands to look like the one in
Figure 2-13. Just turn on the boxes for the clips you want to download. Unlike the
Capture panel described on page 43, the media downloader captures entire video
clips; it doesn’t let you select portions of clips. But it does let you import video files
that live on your PC into Premiere.
The expanded media downloader is divided into two general territories: Source
and Save Options.
Source
Use the drop-down menu to choose the camcorder, device, or computer folder
that holds the video you want to bring into Premiere. The list automatically shows
the camcorders, still cameras, and scanners attached to your PC. Below the drop-
down menu, you see a message that lists the number of files you’ve selected.
Another helpful bit of info is the amount of space required to store the selected
files. Under Source, you see three buttons that show and hide video, still images,
and audio files in the list. If you’re only interested in using video, deselect the other
two options. The largest area of the display is devoted to thumbnails of your
media. You can view video clips by clicking their triangle buttons. Turn on the
checkboxes to select the media you want to download—in other words, copy—
from your gadget to your PC.
Save Options
The Save Options settings let you organize and name the files as Premiere copies
them from your camcorder to your PC. Click the Browse button to choose where
you want to store the files. To organize your clips into subfolders, click the Create
Subfolders drop-down menu and choose whether to organize your files by date or

name. If you plan to do most of your video work in Premiere, using dates to orga-
nize video clip folders and files works well, because you can combine date ranges
with Premiere’s other organizing tools (albums and tags) to help you find clips. Use
the Rename Files drop-down menu to determine how Premiere names the clips
when it stows them on your PC. You can choose not to rename the files, give them a
name of your own choosing, or use the date in combination with a custom name.
That last option is cool because it gives you two ways to identify a file in the future.
Video and photo files can store addition text information, called metadata, along
with the images. Metadata comes in handy if you someday have to credit the file’s
creator, provide copyright details, and so on. If you turn on “Preserve Current
Filename in XMP”, Premiere stores the original filename in the metadata. Click the
triangle next to Apply Metadata, and you see a few other ways you can add text to
your video and photo files. Under “Template to use”, choose None if the whole
topic bores you and you’re not interested in adding metadata. If you choose Basic
Metadata, you can add your name as creator and whatever copyright details you
want. Also, Premiere stores any metadata your camcorder or camera attaches—
like the frame rate and other technical details.
Note: Premiere stores metadata in the folder you specify in Location, along with your video clips. The
files with .xmp extensions are text files that hold the metadata Premiere and your camcorder add to the
video clips.

Import from Hard Disk or Memory Camcorder
The steps for importing video from hard-disk-based and memory-card camcord-
ers are nearly identical. For the most part, Premiere doesn’t care whether the video
is stored on a hard drive or memory chip. It just needs to know which files to
import and how you’d like to name the clips.
1. Connect your camcorder to your PC.
Some camcorders use a USB cable. Others, such as the new minicamcorders,
have a USB connector built in to the camera. (For details about USB and Fire-
Wire cables, see the box on page 51.)
2. Start Premiere.
Choose either New Project or Open Project, as described on page 16.
3. In the Tasks panel, click the Organize tab.
The Organize tab displays any media that’s already stored in your project. At
the top of panel you see four buttons: Get Media, Media, InstantMovie, and
Organizer.
4. Click Get Media.
The Tasks panel displays several icons showing devices that hold raw video files,
like “DV Camcorder” or “DVD (Camcorder or PC DVD Drive)”.
5. Click “AVCHD or other hard disk/memory camcorder”.
The media downloader window appears, where you can choose the camcorder
or device that holds your video clips. As explained on page 58, you can view the
media downloader in either of two modes: Standard Dialog (as shown back in
Figure 2-4) or Advanced Dialog (Figure 2-13). The button that lets you choose
is in the lower-left corner.
6. If necessary, click the Advanced Dialog button.
The media downloader expands to the larger view shown in Figure 2-13. On the
left side, you see the Source settings. On the right side, you see the Save
Options. The Advanced Dialog also shows you thumbnails of the download-
able video clips and other media.
7. Turn on the checkboxes under the thumbnails that you want to import.
If you want to preview a video clip, click the triangle Play button below the
thumbnail. At the bottom of the window, you see buttons to Check All or
Uncheck All of the thumbnails.
8. Click Get Media.
Premiere copies the files from the camcorder or other device to your hard disk. You
see a progress bar as the files transfer. When the process is over, the media down-
loader closes, and you see the video clips in the Organize tab ready for editing.

Import DVD Camcorder Video
DVD camcorders record video onto mini-DVDs that are 3 inches in diameter. Single-
layer, single-sided discs hold 1.4 gigabytes of video, which is about half an hour of
standard digital video. You can also get double-sided discs—you flip them over to
record on the second side. Since 2006, you can get single-sided dual-layer discs
that record twice as much, but your camcorder, PC, and DVD player must all sup-
port dual-layer discs. As with their bigger 5-inch brothers, these mini-DVDs may
record once (DVD-R or DVD+R) or they can record, be erased, and recorded on
again (DVD-RW or DVD+RW). The key here is to learn (and remember) which
discs your equipment supports. The one format that you can use on almost any
equipment is the DVD-R (record-once) format.
DVD camcorders compress video and can store it in a couple of different formats,
including one of the many MPEG formats or AVCHD. Depending on your cam-
corder, you may be able to import video using the steps described below, “Import
from Hard Disk or Memory Camcorder”, or you can import from the recorded
DVDs using the steps described in “Import Video from DVD” on page 63.
Import Video from PC Hard Disk
There are a lot of reasons why you might have video clips on your PC that you
haven’t imported into Premiere. For example, someone may give or email you
some videos, or maybe they’re from earlier video projects. If you want to follow
the exercises in this book using the same video clips shown in the examples, see the
box on page 63. You can download the clips and then use these steps to import the
clips into Premiere. In any case, you’re free to import files on your PC into Pre-
miere so you can use them your projects. Follow these steps to use the media
downloader to import video from your PC’s hard disk.
1. In Premiere’s Tasks panel, click the Organize tab and then choose Get Media.
The Organize tab shows the different devices you can choose to import video.
2. Choose “PC Files and Folders”.
The Add Media window opens.
3. Navigate to a specific file or folder you want to import.
Premiere Elements can import selected files, or it can import all the video clips
in a particular folder.
4. Select the files or folder you want to import.
You can select a single file or multiple files using Ctrl-click. If you want to
import all the video files in a folder, just select the folder.
5. Click Open to import files or click Add Folder to import all the video files in a
folder.
Premiere Elements displays a progress bar as it imports the files. When it’s done,
the Add Media window closes and you see the video files in the Organize tab.

Import Video from DVD
Besides the DVDs that your camcorder records, you may have DVDs your friends
or family made that you want to work with in Premiere. All DVDs store video in
container files that have a .vob extension. Some DVDs—such as those containing
the latest blockbuster movies—are copy-protected. You can’t import protected
DVDs with Premiere, but you can import DVD video from camcorders. Premiere
brings in the entire VOB file, and you can edit it as you would any other video clip.
Here’s how to move VOBs from DVD to your PC:

the media downloader in either of two modes: Standard Dialog or Advanced
Dialog.
3. Under Source, use the “Get Media from” drop-down menu to select your DVD
drive (Figure 2-2).
Thumbnails of the VOB files appear in the media downloader. If you don’t see
the thumbnails, make sure that the Video button is selected.
4. If necessary, click the Advanced Dialog button.
The media downloader expands to the larger view as shown in Figure 2-13. On
the left side of the window you see the Source settings. On the right side of the
window you see the Save Options.
5. Turn on the checkboxes under the thumbnails you want to import.
It takes a while for Premiere to load all the files on a DVD, but be patient. Once
they’re loaded you can preview the individual VOB files as you would any clip.
Just click the Play button. Under each thumbnail you see its file name. Some are
marked “(Menu)”, and they’re probably not the ones you want. Other VOB files
have sequential names such as VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, VTS_01_3.VOB,
and so on. These sequential files may divide larger content into equal parts, so
it’s organized by size rather than subject matter.
6. Click Get Media.
Premiere copies the files from the DVD to your hard disk. Be patient; these files
are sometimes very big, and DVDs aren’t all that fast at sending data. You’ll see
a progress bar as the files transfer. When the process is complete, the media
downloader closes and you’re ready to edit.
Import from VHS Videotape or Other Analog Source
As time marches on, there’ll be fewer analog sources of video that you want to pull
into your Premiere projects. But if you’re like most people, you still have a collec-
tion of old family VHS vids. Or you may come across a training video at work
that’s on Hi8, but it’s otherwise still good. The image quality isn’t likely to be great,
but it’s worth saving the movies for posterity. Premiere only works with digital
video, so you must convert these ancient gems into digital video before Premiere
can slurp them up. You can do the job in a couple of ways:
• Use a camcorder as a pass-through. Some camcorders can act as an analog-to-
digital go-between. You plug the output from an old VHS VCR into the inputs
on your camcorder, and then plug your camcorder into your PC. As you play
the videotape in the VCR, the camcorder converts the analog image to digital,
and Premiere saves the digital video to your PC.

Chapter 2: Import Your Clips
65
Add Raw Footage
Note: Unfortunately, video input connections are most common on older MiniDV tape-based camcorders.
Most of the newer, smaller, and less expensive camcorders don’t provide this feature.
• Use a camcorder as a recorder. Even if your camcorder doesn’t do pass-
through, you may still be able to record the analog video on your camcorder.
Then you can import it in the usual fashion. To do so, your camcorder must
have video inputs so you can connect it to your old VCR.
• Use an AV/DV converter box or card. If your camcorder refuses to help, you
can beg, borrow, or buy an analog-to-digital video converter from a company
like Blackmagic Design, Creative Labs, Grass Valley (Canopus), or Pinnacle.
These units have multiple audio/video input connectors. The output is usually
the same kind of FireWire or USB connector you find on camcorders. Plug your
VCR into the box and then connect the box to your PC. Converters give you
excellent analog-to-digital quality. The downside is that the boxes ($100 to
$500) can cost as much as an inexpensive or used camcorder.
• Use a video service company to convert for you. There are a number of compa-
nies that convert analog video to digital for you. You might be able to find some
in your home town. If not, you can find them on the Web. For example, iMemories
(www.imemories.com) converts video, audio, still photos, and home movies to
DVDs. They’ll even send you a FedEx box so you can track your original stuff
when you ship it back and forth.

Import Sound, Still
Pictures, and
Animation
Say you’ve been charged with producing the official video for your upcoming family
reunion. Depending on how “Hollywood” you want to go, your movie may
include background music, a few sound effects, cutaways to old family photos, and
baby pictures of everyone who’s coming. And you might want to jazz up the clos-
ing credits with a narrated animation of a harried you pulling all this together.
None of these elements are video clips, of course, but so long as you can get them
into your computer, you can use them in your Premiere project.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to add music and other sound files to your video
and how to create and record sound effects and narration. You’ll also learn how to
add still images and animation and how to avoid some of the common pitfalls of
mixing and matching media.
Add Sound Clips
When you hit the Record button on your camcorder, you capture both images and
sound. The camera picks up conversations, rumbling trucks, and the wind as it
rushes by the mic. But let’s face it, camcorder audio doesn’t always make the per-
fect soundtrack. So borrow a trick from Tinseltown and make your movie sound
as good as it looks: Use the audio from your camcorder where appropriate, but
don’t stop there. Add background music to convey the mood of your video (and to
mask unwanted background noise the camcorder picks up). And what about
sound events you didn’t capture, such as closing doors, thunderclaps, laughter, or
screeching tires? In cases like these, you need to add sound effects, also known as SFX.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Add Sound Clips
You can record your own or snag them from an SFX library. (See page 70 for more
details about Foley artists, sound effects, and sound libraries.) Finally, you can
have your main character narrate a backstory as your movie’s plot unfolds.
Sound Formats
As you start working with sound files, you soon discover that they come in as
many formats as radio stations. The good news is that they break down into two
major groups: compressed files and uncompressed files. As you might expect, there
are pluses and minuses with each.
Compressed files record sound with an eye toward your hard drive’s limited stor-
age capacity; stripping out notes and tones you’re less likely to hear in the cause of
saving space.
Uncompressed files, on the other hand, convert every note and tuba blast into the
ones and zeroes of a high-fidelity digital recording, resulting in a file that, while
faithful to the original source, is huge—sometimes 10 times as large as a com-
pressed file.
Premiere works with almost all types of sound files, compressed and uncom-
pressed, including the two major Windows formats, MP3 (compressed) and WAV
files (uncompressed). See Table 3-1 for the complete list.
Table 3-1. Sound file formats
Format name
File extension
Description
Advanced Audio Coding
.aac
Similar to MP3, the AAC format compresses
audio files to make them smaller. Apple’s iPods
and the iTunes store use AAC compression, even
though the filenames have a different extension,
like M4A (unprotected) or M4P (copy-protected).
You can use M4A files with Premiere but
not M4P.
Dolby AC-3
.ac3
Dolby Digital audio is stored in AC3 files which
can store the six channels of sound used by
today’s home theaters. Usually known as 5.1, the
six channels are one center, two front, and two
rear—the subwoofer is the .1 in the nomencla-
ture. When you want to impress your audience
with spatial sound effects, this is the way to go.
Macintosh Audio
.aif, .aiff
The Mac’s equivalent of uncompressed WAV files
is the AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format). This
format is useful when you share music or sound
effects on a Mac.

Chapter 3: Import Sound, Still Pictures, and Animation
69
Add Sound Clips
So, which type of file should you use in your project? Wherever possible, use
uncompressed files, such as WAV (pronounced “wave”) or AIFF files. That’s
because Premiere takes advantage of all the uncompressed fidelity you can send it.
Sure, when you export your project to turn it into a movie file, Premiere com-
presses the audio (and the video) to match the intended media (if your movie’s
headed to YouTube, for example, everything’s compressed more than if it’s des-
tined for a DVD). But audio files always sound better if you compress them just
once, so start off with uncompressed audio if you can.
On the other hand, if the only source files you have are in compressed format, such
as MP3 or AAC files, that’s okay. Just try to use the best-sounding files you can.
After you import a sound file, it appears in the Organize tab along with all your
other assets (Figure 3-1).
MP3 Audio
.mp3
Technically known as MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, the
MP3 format is a byproduct of a movie encoding
standard that took on a life of its own when it
came to creating music files. You’ll find lots of
opportunities to use MP3s in your movies, but it’s
not your best choice because MP3s lose audio
quality when they’re compressed. If you’re creat-
ing the MP3s, you can control this by using a high
bit rate in the encoding. For example choose 320
bits per second instead of 128 bits per second.
However, the best option is to use WAV files,
which are bigger, but of higher quality.
QuickTime
.mov, .m4a
Apple developed QuickTime as the multimedia
centerpiece for Macintosh computers. The Quick-
Time player, available for both Mac and Win-
dows PCs, plays several video and audio formats,
including MOV and M4A. You can think of M4A
files as a new, improved MP3 format. Both are
based in the MPEG (Motion Picture Experts
Group) standards. Keep in mind that files in the
M4P format (often purchased from the iTunes
store) are copy-protected so you can’t use them
in Premiere Elements.
Windows Media
.wma
Created by Microsoft as a competitor to the MP3
format, WMA files are compressed creating a loss
in fidelity. There are a few different flavors of
WMA, some of which may be copy-protected.
Windows WAVE
.wav
The name stands for Waveform, and it’s a stan-
dard created jointly by Microsoft and IBM for
storing uncompressed audio. WAV files are
higher quality but bigger than MP3s. Usually,
they’re you’re best option if you want a top-
quality audio track.

SOUND ADVICE
Sound Effects and Jack Foley
Hollywood pros who create sound effects are known as
Foley artists. The name is a tribute to Jack Foley, who
worked in film during its transition from silent movies to
talkies. Foley pioneered many techniques for capturing
sound. You can follow in his audible footsteps (clack, click,
clack) by recording your own sound effects.
Keep in mind that sounds aren’t always what they seem.
Sometimes thunder is just a piece of sheet metal snapped
back and forth. If you’re creative, you’ll see ways to make
interesting sounds everywhere you look. Crumple a piece
of paper to reflect frustration. Maybe your garage door
opener sounds like an airplane engine starting up.
If you need inspiration, start off in your kitchen and check
out the utensils, pots, and pans (and don’t forget the food
processor). If you’re serious about recording sound effects,
you may want to check out the following websites. Audio-
Cookbook has an interesting blog, One Sound Every Day,
where Foley artists explain how they capture certain
sounds.
http://FilmSound.org
http://AudioCookBook.org
As an alternative to recording your own effects, you can visit
online libraries that let you download free sounds.
Googling something like free sound effects library should
do the trick. You’re not limited to film-related sites, either. If
you’re going for something specific, like a bird call or the
croak of a toad, it’s worth checking out fan sites that are
bird- or toad-specific. Here are some sites to get you

SmartSound and Other Sources for Music
So where do you start your search for music and sound effects? Sure, you can
search online, but why not start with your own computer? You might be surprised
at the number of sound files stored there. The first place that comes to mind is
your iTunes or Music folder. If you’re like most people, your folders have a combina-
tion of copy-protected files and non-protected files from iTunes or another music ser-
vice, or copied from CDs you own. (For tips on using commercial music in your
videos see “Staying out of Copyright Trouble” on page 72.)
In addition to music, your computer probably has lots of other sound files installed
as part of programs or games. You can find them by pressing Windows+F and then
typing .wav or .mp3 into the search box. For the biggest list of sound files, make
sure your search includes program and system files.
Want to add some professional-quality music to your project, but don’t know your
bass from your treble clef? Premiere comes with a SmartSound plug-in that
amounts to an online store for music. To start the plug-in, click the Audio Tools
button in the upper-right corner of the timeline (Figure 3-2). Choose the Smart-
Sound option, and the SmartSound Quicktracks window opens.
Click the text next to “Name”, and a second panel named SmartSound Maestro
opens, filled with clips, as shown in Figure 3-3. Each clip has a descriptive title.
Double-click it to preview the clip before you use it.
To add a clip to your project, click the Select button. Your selection appears in the
Quicktracks window, which also shows you the clip’s length and variation. Click
OK, and Premiere downloads the music to your computer. It then appears in your
project panel.
The SmartSound music you download is “royalty-free.” That means the artist still
holds the copyright to it, but you can use it for most non-commercial purposes. If
your movie is a feature film or it’s going to be broadcast on television, however,
you’re going to have fork over some money to the artist.

The Audio Tools button above the timeline has options for the

SOUND ADVICE
Staying out of Copyright Trouble
Movies and TV shows shell out big money to use famous
hits from the best musicians. You know your latest video
would be oh-so-much-better if only you could put your
favorite tune on the soundtrack, but you’d rather not end
up in court. Well, there are some cases where you probably
won’t get targeted by lawyers from the Recording Industry
Association of America. Here are some tips that should
keep you out of the defendant’s chair:
• Don’t use commercial music for any video you sell
or profit from. It’s not fair to the musician if they
don’t get a share.
• Don’t use commercial music for a project that’s
going to be viewed publicly. That means don’t use
music you don’t own for submissions to an indepen-
dent film festival or for uploads to a public website.
That said, you probably won’t get in trouble for adding
commercial music to the soundtrack of your family reunion
that you distribute by disc, email, or on an invitation-only
website.
For the other cases, make your own music, hire a local
band, or hunt down music that’s free to use. It’s worth not-
ing that “free to use” and “royalty free” are two different
things. “Free to use” means you don’t have to pay anything.
“Royalty free” often means you pay once for the rights to
use the music on different projects—you just don’t have to
pay a royalty every time it is viewed or broadcast.

Tip: Looking for other sources of music for your movie? Try this site http://freemusicarchive.org. Music is
organized by genre. Much of the music comes under the Creative Commons usage license. For each track,
check the column on the right for copyright details. For classical music, try www.musopen.com.
Preview Audio Clips
You probably want to audition sound clips before you go to the trouble of import-
ing them into your project. If you find downloadable clips online, you’ll usually see
a player embedded in the web page so you can preview the clip.
For sound clips on your PC, all you have to do is double-click the file to open and
play it in Windows Media Player, iTunes, QuickTime, or another pre-installed
media player. This works for most of the sound file formats listed on page 68.
Which media player pops up depends on what you have installed on your system
and how it’s configured. To choose a specific media player, right-click the sound
file and choose Open With, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Record Your Own Sound Effects
Sprinkle some key sound effects throughout your movie and the soundtrack goes
from blah to BAM! Your camcorder captures sounds, but often the camera is too
far away from the sound source to get a really good recording. You can improve
your soundtrack and add dramatic impact by recording sound effects and placing
them at key moments in your movie.

Connect a Mic to Your Computer
To record your own sound effects, you need a mic. Many laptops have built-in
mics, as do most webcams, though the sound quality is probably only so-so in
both cases.
To get better sound, you need a better mic. Let your wallet be your guide—mic
prices range from cheap to ridiculous. For recording sound effects and instruments,
dynamic microphones work best, and they’re rugged if you need to take them into
the field. For voice recordings like narration (covered in the next section), consider a
condenser microphone. The large-diaphragm models cost more, but they capture
the nuances of your voice better, just as audio speakers with larger surfaces produce
better sound detail. (For more tips on mics, see the box on page 75.)
Tip: If a dedicated mic is out of your reach and you don’t have a laptop or webcam with a built-in mic,
connect your camcorder to your PC and record live audio through it.
If you use your mic primarily with your computer, it makes sense to get one of the
newer models that plugs into a USB port (Figure 3-5). If you’ve already got a stable
of great pro-quality mics, consider getting an adapter that connects these XLR pro
mics to USB ports.
Figure 3-5:
Here are three types of plugs that mics
use, from left to right: XLR, miniplug, and
USB. Windows recognizes and
automatically sets up mics that use USB
plugs, making them the easiest to use.
Use a miniplug mic (center), and the
setup chores are up to you. XLR mics
need an XLR-to-USB adapter.

Some mics have miniplug conectors, similar to the plugs for iPod or other MP3-
player headphones. See Figure 3-5 for the different types of mic connectors. You
can plug these directly into your computer, but setting them up is more work than
setting up a USB mic. When you plug in a USB mic, your computer automatically
installs the needed drivers and lets you know it’s ready to go by sounding a tone.
SOUND ADVICE
Choose a Mic
Buying a mic is like buying a camera or a camcorder. There
are lots of options and a ton of technical jargon—and every-
one has an opinion (especially the salesperson). Of course,
your needs and budget determine the type of mic you get,
from cheap, under-$50 models to super-expensive over-
$1,000 gems. In the midst of this, there are mics that’ll do
the job you want and some of them may even be close to
your budget.
To Record Live Sound, you may need a couple of different
types of mics. The mic on your camcorder tries to do every-
thing, often from a distance. If you’re recording a voice and
it’s not close to the camera, you may want to get a lavalier mic
(often just called a “lav”). These are the little mics you see
clipped to newscasters’ lapels. You want your lav as close to
the person’s mouth as possible. It’s okay for the news “talking
heads” to have a mic show, but if you’re shooting a dramatic
scene set in 1776, you have to hide the lav under some cloth-
ing, which may affect the sound quality.
Another staple of sound engineers is the shotgun mic.
They’re bigger and often kind of long. Designed to pick up
sound from a distance, shotguns are directional. That
means you point the tip of the mic at the sound you want,
and it doesn’t pick up much sound from the sides or the
rear. Some shotguns mount on your video camera, and
others use a separate boom—a long pole that requires a
person to point it in the right direction.
The tone and quality of sound you get from a lav or a shot-
gun mic is likely to differ. If you can, experiment with both.
In some cases, you may want to record with both. Then,
when you edit, you can choose the best recording or
maybe mix the two.
To Record Musical Events, try to use multiple micro-
phones with at least one mic for every instrument, includ-
ing voices. Unfortunately, circumstances and finances don’t
always permit that kind of production. Short of that, follow
the rule about getting your mic as close to the sound source
as possible. Perhaps you can place a couple of mics on or
near the stage. Or maybe you can use two camcorders for
the shoot and keep one close to the performers, recording
closeups and good-quality sound. A second camera could
be further from the stage recording group shots and audi-
ence reactions.
To Record Narration, you want a mic that can sit on your
desktop and capture your voice at close range. A lot of dif-
ferent mics can do that. On the low end, you can use the
mic built in to your computer (common on laptops) or an
inexpensive mic that plugs into your USB port (cheaper
USB mics cost $10 to $40). The sound quality isn’t great, but
they might do for your needs.
A step up from USB teleconferencing mics are a newer
breed of USB mics like the Snowball from a company called
Blue
or
Audio
Technica’s
Condenser
Mic
(model
AT2020USB). These mics range in price from $100 to $200.
If you already have some good-quality mics, like those used
for home studio recording or live performances, you may
want to get an adapter that converts mics with XLR connec-
tors to USB. Shure, one of the big dogs in the mic biz, offers
X2u adapters for about $130, or you can get the adapter
and a good mic for a couple of hundred dollars.

SOUND ADVICE
Make Your Miniplug Mic Work
As explained on page 74, USB mics are easy to connect to
your computer because Windows recognizes them when
you plug them in and installs any drivers they might need.
When you plug a miniplug mic into your computer or
soundcard, Windows doesn’t know it’s there and it’s up to
you to make sure it works. (Miniplugs look like the little
plug on the end of your headphone cord.)
1. Plug your miniplug mic into your computer.
If you’re lucky, your desktop computer has a socket
for a mic plug in the front. It may be hidden under a
panel. If not, you’ll have to get around to the back of
the computer and plug it into the sound card. It may
be hard to see, but most sockets have little icons to
indicate whether the socket is for headphones or a
mic. The mic sockets for notebook computers are
usually on the side.
2. Choose Windows ➝Control Panel › Hardware
and Sound › Sound ➝ Manage audio devices.
Initially, the Sound panel opens to the Playback
tab, where you see headphones and other play-
back gadgets.
If the Control Panel is set to the Classic view, you
won’t see “Hardware and Sound” you just see
Sound among the many Control Panel options. In
that case, click Sound to open the Sound panel.
3. Click the Recording tab.
The Sound panel displays Audio input devices, but
this is where it can be a little confusing. Your com-
puter knows about the capabilities of your sound
card, but it doesn’t necessarily know what’s plugged
in. You may see devices that you don’t have. For
example, the Sound panel in Figure 3-6 shows Line
In even though the option isn’t enabled.
4. If necessary, right-click Microphone and choose
Enable from the shortcut menu.
5. If you don’t see a checkmark on Microphone,
you need to enable it. The shortcut menu
shows several options for Microphone, includ-
ing a link to the Microphone Properties panel.
6. Talk directly into your mic.
As you speak, the green bars to the right of Micro-
phone show the level (volume) for the mic. It should
be moving well past the midpoint as you talk, but not
pinned to the top of the level indicator. If you’re happy
with the results, your Mic setup is done and you can
click OK to close the Sound and Control Panel. If
you’re not getting the level you’d like, keep on reading.
If there’s no signal in the level meter, double-check a
few things. Some mics have on/off switches and vol-
ume controls. Make sure yours is on and the vol-
ume is cranked up. Some mics use batteries (and it’s
not always obvious). Make sure your mic has a good
battery. Last, but not least, double-check that you’re
mic is plugged into a mic socket. The input and out-
put sockets on sound cards are small and look the
same. It’s easy to plug into the wrong spot.
7. If you need to adjust the level of your mic, click
Properties and then choose the Levels tab.
The Microphone Properties panel opens with tabs
along the top. When you choose the Levels tabs,
you see two sliders that help you control the mic
level.
8. First, adjust the Microphone slider.
Use the Level slider like any volume control—drag to
the right to increase the mic level.
9. If necessary, adjust the Microphone Boost.
The Microphone Boost slider changes the power of
the signal coming from the mic, showing the gain in
decibels. Again, drag to the right to increase the level.

When you plug in a miniplug mic, the computer doesn’t necessarily know it’s
there, and it’s up to you to make sure that your sound card recognizes the mic and
works with it. See the box on page 77 for some help. (There are more details on
mics and recorders in Chapter 10, page 291.)
If you plan to record a lot of sound effects, consider investing in a portable digital
recorder. Lots of good sounds aren’t within range of your computer. Just like cam-
corders, you can get portable recorders that save sound to memory card, disc, or
hard drive. It’s best to get the type used to record music rather than the ones used
for office dictation. They cost more (upwards of $100), but you get much better
sound and they’re more computer-friendly. Some of the handier ones record to
both the MP3 format and the higher-quality WAV format.
To copy files to your computer, connect the recorder using a USB cable or pop the
recorder’s memory card into your PC.
Tip: In a pinch, you can always use your camcorder or cellphone as a field recorder. Just keep in mind
that the sound quality won’t be as good as that from a dedicated, digital recorder.
Figure 3-6:
Use the Sound control panel to set up your

Test Your Computer Mic
If you want to test your mic, you can use Windows’ built-in Sound Recorder pro-
gram. Click the Windows button and type Sound Recorder or go to Windows ➝
Programs ➝Accessories ➝Sound Recorder. Click the Start Recording button and
jabber away or make some other sound. Click Stop Recording when you’re done. A
Save As window opens, giving you the option to name and save your sound. If it’s
just a test, you may want to save it to your desktop to make it easy to find and play.
Windows stores sound clips recorded with the Sound Recorder in WMA format,
which Premiere understands. You can add WMA files to your project using the
steps described on page 85. There’s one main drawback to using Sound Recorder if
your computer uses Windows XP or an earlier operating system—it limits the clips
to 60 seconds. That’s not so bad for short sound effects, but it’s easy to bump
against the limit for voice, music, or other recordings.
Famous Movie Moment: The term MOS is Hollywood jargon for shooting film without sound. Some
folks like to say the term comes from some of the early German directors like Ernst Lubitsch or Fritz Lang,
who might have said “Mit out Sprechen” or “Mit out Sound.” More likely, the term has technical origins
and comes from the phrase “motor only shot,” meaning the camera motor is running but not the sound.
Capture Live Sound
Once you have a mic, you can record live sound using Premiere’s Capture panel
(see the instructions below), which works with most standalone mics, including:
• USB mics that plug directly into your computer with a USB cable or mics that
connect with a USB adapter.
• Miniplug mics that plug directly into the front of your computer or into your
computer’s soundcard.
• Webcams that include a mic and connect to your computer via USB.
You can also connect your DV or HDV tape-based camcorder to your PC and use
its mic as your sound source. This setup won’t work with hard-drive and memory-
based camcorders, however, because they use Premiere’s Media Downloader to
move media clips into Premiere.
In each of these cases, you record sound directly to Premiere (via the Capture
panel). The process is almost exactly the same as the process described on page 44.
The major difference is that you don’t have to worry about the video.
As an example, here are the steps to capture only sound from a webcam:
1. In Premiere Elements, click the Organize tab and then choose Get Media.
You see the icons that represent the sources for media, including Webcam or
WDM Device.

2. Click Webcam or WDM Device.
The Capture panel opens, displaying the Capturing Source drop-down menus
at the top.
3. Click the menu next to Audio and select the mic for your webcam.
There may be a couple of audio sources listed in the menu. You don’t need to
worry about setting the video source, because you deselect video in the next step.
4. On the right side of the Capture panel, next to “Capture”, deselect Video and
select Audio.
As shown in Figure 3-7, you can choose to capture audio and video or just one
media stream. Even if you choose to capture sound only, you probably still see
video previewed in the Capture panel’s monitor.
5. Click Capture and make some noise.
You can record voice or sound effects as long as you get the sound source close
to your mic.
Figure 3-7:
Using the Capture settings, you can choose to
capture video, audio, or both. This works when
you’re using the Capture panel with any source,
like a webcam, camcorder, or USB mic.

6. Click Pause when you’re through recording.
Premiere saves the sound clip and adds it to the Organize tab. You can con-
tinue to capture clips by clicking the Capture button again, or you can close the
capture panel as described in the next step.
7. Click the X in the upper-right corner of the Capture panel.
The Capture window closes, and you see your audio clip in the Organize tab.
Once you capture a sound clip in Premiere, you can preview it a couple of ways:
• Double-click an audio clip, and it opens in the Preview window. Instead of a
video image, you see an audio waveform in the window. Press the Play button
to hear the clip.
• Drag a clip to one of the Audio tracks in your timeline, and then use the moni-
tor controls to play the clip (see Figure 3-8). If the Capture to Timeline box was
checked in the Capture panel, a copy of your sound clip is already there.
Another option is to choose Window ➝Available Media in Premiere. The Orga-
nize tab changes to show your media clips in list form, displaying details such as
duration and media type. If you want to see only audio clips in the list, deselect the
Video and Still options beside the “Filter by” label at the top of the panel. To pre-
view your recently recorded clip, double-click it. A preview window opens, showing
your sound clip as a waveform. You can use the control buttons at the bottom of the
window to play the clip.

Add Narration
Tip: If you can’t get Premiere’s Capture panel to recognize your USB microphone using the Webcam or
WDM device setting, it may have to do with the mic’s drivers. If that’s the case, you might still be able to
record sound clips using Windows Sound Recorder, as described on page 78. Then you can add the
sound files to your project using the steps described on page 85.
Add Narration
When you sit down to edit your movie, most of the soundtrack is in place. But
there’s one audio element you add while you’re in your editing room: the narra-
tion. Premiere makes it easy to add “voiceover” as you watch your video play back
in the monitor. You probably want to record your narration after you finish edit-
ing. That way, you won’t be narrating scenes that get cut.
Exactly how much narration there is in a movie varies a lot. Sometimes, movies use
it only at the beginning or the end. But if you’ve got a Sam Spade character in your
movie, perhaps he’s wisecracking all the way through.
You need to decide whether you want to script your narration beforehand or if you
want a more off-the-cuff feeling. Usually, the audience can tell when someone nar-
rates from a script, and the results often sound a little stiff. To avoid that, try creating
bullet points with just a few words to remind you of each topic you want to cover.
Of course, you’ve also got the images to help you out. Like any public speaker, try
to keep the “ums” to a minimum.
It’s best to try and record all your narration in the same sitting, because your voice,
and even the sound of your room, change over time. On the other hand, during
that session, don’t be afraid to stop and rerecord parts if you make a mistake. You
can also use the sound-editing techniques described in Chapter 10 (page 291) to
clean up and edit your narration.
Set Up Your Mic for Narration
When you’re ready to roll, plug your mic into your computer. Before you start
recording in Premiere, it makes sense to check your mic in Windows to ensure it’s
working and the volume (sometimes called gain) is adjusted properly. To do that,
go to Windows ➝Control Panel. The control panel looks different depending on
which version of Windows you have (and on a few other settings, too). What you
want is Windows’ tool for setting the recording levels of attached mics. You may
see a category in the Control Panel called “Hardware and Sound”, or “Sounds,
Speech, and Audio Devices”, or you may see an item named “Sound”.
Whichever you have, open the sound panel to the Recording tab, as shown in
Figure 3-9. When you talk into your mic, you should see one of the green level
meters go up and down. Nothing happening? Double-check your cable connec-
tion, and see if your mic has an on/off switch set to Off. Some mics use batteries, so

82
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Add Narration
pop in a spare if you have one. Once you get a level reading, check to see if it’s too
low or too high. If it is, click Properties and then, in the Microphone Properties
panel, click Levels. Adjust the Microphone slider as you speak until you get the
level right.
You need to tell Premiere what hardware you’re using to record and play back
sound. To do that, go to Edit ➝Preferences ➝Audio Hardware. Then, click the
ASIO Settings button. The Audio Hardware Settings panel opens. It has two tabs:
Input for your microphone and Output for speakers or headphones. Click the
Input setting and make sure that your mic is selected, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-9:
The Sound panel shows the

Add Narration
Record Narration
The moment has arrived when you put voice to mic and add narration to your
project:
1. Position the playhead where you want to start narrating.
Premiere gives you a handy 3-second countdown before it starts recording, but
if that isn’t enough, move the playhead forward a couple seconds.
2. Click Audio Tools and choose Add Narration.
The Record Voice Narration window opens, as shown in Figure 3-11, with just
a few controls for chores like starting and stopping the recording and playback.
3. Turn on the “Mute audio while recording” checkbox.
You don’t want your voice and the other audio coming back at you as you
record. At best, it’s a little confusing. At worst, it creates feedback as your mic
picks up sounds from the speakers.
4. Take a deep breath, relax, and sit up straight.
These are tips from the voice coach.
Figure 3-10:
Two preferences panels
are shown here. The first,
Preferences, is set to

second, Audio Hardware

5. Press G (for “go”) or click the red button and begin speaking.
The video plays in the monitor as Premiere records your narration. The level
meter in the Record Voice Narration panel bounces up and down as you speak.
You want the meter to hit the yellow point every so often, but you want to
avoid the red peaks as much as possible. You can adjust the level with the slider
next to the meter.
6. When you finish a segment of narration, click the Stop Recording Narration
button.
The same button starts and stops the recording—it just changes appearance
depending on what it’s doing at the moment. After you click Stop, the narra-
tion clip appears in the timeline. There’s another copy of the narration in the
Project panel, just in case you muck up the timeline version.
Premiere names narration clips Narration_1.wav, Narration_2.wav, and so on.
If you think you can improve on that, right-click the clip in either the timeline
or the Project panel and choose Rename from the shortcut menu.
Premiere automatically positions the playhead at the beginning of the segment
you just recorded, making it easy to listen to the results.
7. Press the space bar or click the Play button.
As you listen to the narration, check to make sure it matches the video. If it
doesn’t match perfectly, is it something you can fix with a little audio editing?
Are there any “ums” you need to delete? Any phrases or sentences that could
stand some rerecording?
It’s easier to make corrections and additions if you record your narration in short
chunks. Give yourself some pauses between statements—they make great places to
split a clip in case you need to swap in a new, improved version. And don’t be
afraid to hit the Delete Present Narration trashcan button and give it another try.

Import Sound Files
to Your Project
Import Sound Files to Your Project
Whether you import sound from a CD, download it from an online source, or
record it live, all you have to do to use it in your project is add it to Premiere. Here
are the steps:
1. In Premiere, click the Organize tab and then click Get Media.
The Organize tab displays the different sources for media.
2. Choose PC Files and Folders.
The Add Media window opens, providing standard Windows tools for brows-
ing through files and folders.
Tip: As an alternative to the Organize tab, you can choose File ➝ Get Media from ➝ PC Files and Folders.
3. Navigate to the folder that has your sound clips.
Use the “Look in” drop-down menu, which displays folders and other com-
puter locations, or use the shortcut buttons on the right for Recent Places,
Desktop, Your User Folder, Computer, and Network. If you need a bigger win-
dow to see your folders and files, drag any of the edges of the Add Media window
to expand the view.
4. Select one or more files to add.
Use any of the standard selection techniques:
• Click to select a file. Shift-click to select adjacent files.
• Ctrl-click to select/deselect more than one file.
• Click and drag to get a bunch of files at once.
You can include video clips or stills in this selection—Premiere is perfectly
happy to add different types of media all at once.
Tip: If you want all the files in a folder, don’t open the folder, just select it and then click the Add Folder
button.
5. Click Open.
Premiere imports the files into your project, displays them in the Organize tab,
and closes the Add Audio window.
Not only does the imported file appear in Premiere, it also appears in a related
program called Elements Organizer, a separate program from Premiere Ele-
ments you’ll learn about in detail in Chapter 4. Both Premiere Elements and
Photoshop Elements use it to organize and tag media. When you add or import
a file in Premiere, it automatically adds the file to Elements Organizer, too, as

86
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Import Still Pictures
shown in Figure 3-12. As with video clips, Premiere and the Organizer create
links to the audio clips stored on your computer. When the files are added, Pre-
miere “conforms” the clips to match the audio settings for your project. For
larger files, you may see a progress bar during the process. Premiere stores the
new conformed audio file with your project file.
If you want to add a sound file to Premiere that’s on a device other than your PC,
like a camcorder, cellphone, memory card, or sound recorder, follow the steps
above but in Step 3, navigate to the device that holds the sound clip.
Once you import clips to Premiere, you can use them immediately. Just drag them
to the audio track in your project’s sceneline or timeline.
Import Still Pictures
There are plenty of reasons you might want to import still pictures into your video.
You might have an old family picture or some subject that exists as a photo only
(it’s not like you’ve never seen a Ken Burns documentary!). Aside from availabil-
ity, you may like the impact of pausing on a still image. And, of course, just
because an image is still doesn’t mean you can’t pan and zoom on it within your
video frame. There are a few things to keep in mind as you import still pics: frame
sizes, aspect ratios, and file formats. Frame sizes and file formats are the most
important issues to understand. Aspect Ratio is the most complicated, geeky issue.
Fortunately, it’s the least likely to cause you a problem because Premiere Elements
is pretty good at managing aspect ratio.
About Frame Size
Your video has a “frame size,” measured in pixels. Frame size is the size of your
playback window. The frame size for standard digital video, for example, is similar
Figure 3-12:
Elements Organizer, used by
both Premiere Elements and
Photoshop Elements, keeps
track of all your video and
audio clips in addition to still
photos. Use the View ➝
Media Types menu to show
and hide types of media.

Chapter 3: Import Sound, Still Pictures, and Animation
87
Import Still Pictures
to that for DVDs: 720 × 480 pixels. If you need to double-check the frame size for
your project, go to Edit ➝Project Settings ➝General and then under Video find
the Frame Size boxes. You can add still images with frame sizes up to 4096 × 4096.
Unless you give Premiere specific instructions, it scales your imported stills to
match your project settings. It’s always better to scale down (shrink an image) than
it is to scale up. When Premiere scales up an image, you’re likely to notice blocki-
ness in the picture, called pixelation.
Sometimes, you might want a very large still imported into your project. Perhaps
you’re planning on panning and zooming over the image. To stop Premiere from
automatically scaling your stills when you import them, go to Edit ➝Preferences ➝
General and turn off the checkbox next to “Default scale to frame size”.
About Aspect Ratio
If you’ve ever watched video on your computer or TV and seen football-shaped
heads (Stewie Griffin aside) or squares that have become rectangles, you’ve
observed a problem with aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the relationship between the
vertical and horizontal measurements of an object. Standard TVs have an aspect
ratio of 4:3, for example, and movie-theater screens have an aspect ratio of 16:9.
When the horizontal and vertical measurements remain proportional from the
time you shoot a picture to when you play it back, everything looks fine. But if you
shoot an image or video in one format (say, with a ratio of 4:3), and then play it
back in widescreen format (16:9), you’ve got the video equivalent of a Silly Putty
impression. Or if you crop a still photo (that is, trim its edges) it can have almost
any aspect ratio.
Not only is a consistent width-to-height aspect ratio in an image or video clip
important for proper-looking playback in a movie, so is a consistent pixel aspect
ratio. Pixel stands for “picture element,” and most people think of a pixel as a little
dot of light on a screen. Cram enough dots onto a screen, and you create an image.
But it turns out that pixels aren’t actually dots, they’re either squares or rectangles;
monitors use square pixels, TVs often use rectangular ones. So, adding a photo to a
movie that’s destined for TV playback could be a problem.
The good news is that most of the time, you don’t have to worry about the intricacies
of pixel aspect ratios because Premiere does a good job of identifying and correct-
ing aspect ratio problems in still photos and video clips as you add them to your
project. Occasionally, you may notice a problem if, for example, your project
mixes NTSC video (American) with PAL video (European), but you’ll probably
rarely, if ever, do that.
Here’s how it works: When you choose a project preset (see page 25), you tell Pre-
miere which pixel aspect ratio to use. When you import stills (or video) Premiere
makes changes as needed so your imported footage conforms to the project. Later,
when you choose to export your movie to YouTube or DVD, Premiere again
makes the necessary adjustments.

88
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Import Still Pictures
Tip: If you want to check the aspect ratio for a particular project, go to Edit ➝Project Settings ➝Gen-
eral and find the Frame Size and the Pixel Aspect Ratio settings. You won’t be able to make changes, but
you can see the pixel aspect ratio used by the preset.
You can review the aspect ratio Premiere uses for individual clips by following these
steps:
1. Choose Window ➝ Available Media.
You see your imported and added media in list form.
2. Right-click on a clip and then choose Interpret Footage.
The Interpret Footage dialog box displays several details about the media,
depending on its type and content. The box is divided into three sections:
Frame Rate, Pixel Aspect Ratio, and Alpha Channel. Under Pixel Aspect Ratio
are two radio buttons. The top button is labeled “Use Pixel Aspect Ratio from
File:” followed by a description such as “Square Pixels” or “D1/DV NTSC”. The
second button is “Labeled Conform to”. To change the pixel aspect ratio for a
clip, click this button and choose one of the options on the menu, as shown in
Figure 3-13.
Still Image File Formats
Like sound files, still images come in a host of file formats (see Table 3-2 for the
list). Some formats excel at displaying photographs, while others are better for
drawings or line art. Each format was developed to solve specific computer issues,
even if that was only to get an edge on the competition.
Figure 3-13:
Use the Interpret Footage dialog box to
review and change the pixel aspect ratio
for a media clip.

Chapter 3: Import Sound, Still Pictures, and Animation
89
Import Still Pictures
No matter. The only thing you need to worry about is image quality and resolu-
tion. For quality, the rule of thumb is the same as for video: Use the best quality
image you can get, and let Premiere massage and compress the file when you share
it. In short, wherever possible, avoid formats that compress images.
As for resolution, you want your still images to be equal to or larger than the size,
in pixels, of your video frame. That’s 720 × 480 pixels for most movies (for more
detail, see page 25).

You import still photos from your camera, cellphone, or other device using Pre-
miere’s media downloader. As you learned in Chapter 2, the media downloader
copies files from a source device to your computer. During the process, you can
rename the file and choose a destination folder. The downloader works the same
for all kinds of media—still photos, audio clips, and video clips. As far as Premiere
is concerned, a media file is a media file. Here are the steps for importing stills
from a digital camera:
1. In Premiere Elements, click the Organize tab and then click Get Media.
The Organize tab displays the devices that can hold media.
2. Choose Digital Still Camera.
The media downloader window opens with the Source settings on the left and
the Save options on the right.
If your media is stored on a different type of device, like a memory card or
DVD camcorder, choose that option. The options that open the media down-
loader are: DVD (Camcorder or PC DVD Drive), AVCHD or other hard disk/
memory camcorder, and Mobile Phone and Players.
Macintosh PICT
.pct, .pic, .pict
A graphics file format developed for Macintosh com-
puters. PICT files may include both bitmapped and

3. In the lower-left corner, click the Advanced Dialog button.
The media downloader has two modes: Standard Dialog and Advanced Dialog.
Use Standard Dialog when you want to import the entire contents of a device.
Use the Advanced Dialog when you want to pick and choose the media to import.
4. Under Source, use the “Get Media from” drop-down menu to select your camera.
Keep in mind that cameras and other devices connected to your computer may
look like a computer drive, complete with a drive letter, like the one shown in
Figure 3-14.
After you select the camera, a dialog box displays the media files stored on the
camera.
5. On the right side, under Save Options, use the Browse button to select a folder
for the imported pics.
If you don’t change the location, Premiere uses your Pictures folder.
6. Use the Create Subfolders drop-down menu to create a naming convention for
the folders that hold imported images.
Choose None if you don’t want to store the imported media in a subfolder. If
you want to provide your own folder name, choose Custom Name and type a
name in the box below the menu. Choose one of the date options to name the
subfolders by the date the media was shot or the date the media was imported.
7. Use the Rename Files options to create a naming convention for the imported
still photos.
The options are similar to those for naming folders. Choose Do not rename files
if you want to keep the names that were used on the still camera. You can
choose Today’s Date to name the files for the import date, or you can name the
files according to the date the images were shot. And again, you can mix and
match dates with a custom name, such as Malibu Beach 2009.

8. (Optional) Use the Apply Metadata settings.
Metadata is a method for attaching text information, such as the Creator’s
name and copyright details, to visual files. Under “Template to use”, choose
None if you don’t want to include metadata. Otherwise, set the menu to Basic
Metadata and type in your name and copyright details.
9. Turn on the checkboxes under the stills (or other media) you want to import.
You can import still photos at the same time as you import audio or video clips.
10.Click Get Media.
A progress bar appears as Photoshop copies the still photos and other media to
your computer. When the process is done, you see the media in the Organize
tab. The imported media is also available in Elements Organizer.
Change the Duration for Stills
A still image is like a single frame of video, but you probably want your image to
stay on screen longer than a single frame. The length of time a still is on screen is
called its duration. There’s a setting in Preferences that determines the duration of
all still images when they’re imported. Choose Edit ➝Preferences ➝General and
look for the Still Image Default Duration box. It’s probably set to something like
150 frames (about 5 seconds). You can change this setting if you want. More
important, you can change the timing for any individual still image after you drop
it into your movie. In the timeline, click and drag one edge of the still clip. When
you do this, the clip stretches or shrinks along the timeline, changing its duration.
For more on editing with the timeline, see page 162.
Create New Photoshop Still Images
If you have both Premiere Elements and Photoshop Elements, there’s another way
to cope with the frame size and aspect ratio issues discussed on page 87. You can
create a new Photoshop image using a command in Premiere Elements. Photo-
shop automatically sizes the image, which begins as an empty frame (Figure 3-15),
to match your Premiere project. At that point, while you’re in Photoshop Ele-
ments, all you have to do is place an image in the frame. As a bonus, while you’re
in Photoshop, you can take advantage of all of Photoshop Elements’ tools, text fea-
tures, and effects. Here’s a step-by-step description of the process:
1. In Premiere, choose File ➝ New ➝ Photoshop File.
The Save Photoshop File As window opens.
2. Name your file, choose a folder to save it in, and click Save.
Premiere creates an empty file, and then automatically opens Photoshop. Why
do you have to name the file at this point? Premiere needs to keep track of the
file, so it can automatically add it to your project.

Chapter 3: Import Sound, Still Pictures, and Animation
93
Import Still Pictures
3. In Photoshop, choose File ➝ Place.
The Place window opens.
4. Navigate to the folder with the image you need.
The Place window looks like your standard file and folder browser. Use the
“Look in” drop-down menu at the top or the shortcut buttons to the left to
navigate.
5. Click the image you want to import and then click Place.
The selected image is sized to match the frame and placed in the Photoshop
document. There are guidelines displayed over the placed image, as shown in
Figure 3-16. The area within the outermost lines is called “video safe.” TVs have
a tendency to crop off parts of an image, and the video safe area indicates what
will be visible on most TVs. (The area within the innermost guides is known as
the “title safe” area. You certainly don’t want to crowd any titles in your image,
so keep your text within the title safe area and you’re in good shape.)
Figure 3-15:
One of the easiest ways to make a still image with a frame
size that matches your project is to use Premiere’s File ➝
New ➝ Photoshop File command. Photoshop Elements
starts automatically and creates an empty image with just
the right proportions. All you have to do is place or create a
real image in the frame.

6. Edit the image.
You can use all Photoshop’s tools and all your skills to create an image for your
video. Keep in mind that most of the time, simpler works better in video. If
you’re using type, make sure it’s large with a color that contrasts well with the
background.
7. When you’re finished editing the image, click File ➝ Exit.
A dialog box opens, asking if you want to save your changes.
Tip: If you want to keep Photoshop Elements running, you can choose File ➝Close. Just keep in mind
that running both Photoshop and Premiere Elements at the same time may make your computer run a lit-
tle slowly.
8. Click Yes.
The Save As window opens, displaying the filename and folder you specified in
Step 2.
If you don’t want to save your changes, you can click No. In that case, Photo-
shop closes, and you’re back where you were in Step 1. If you decide the image
needs editing, click Cancel and you’re back in Photoshop.
9. Click Save and then, in the alert box click OK.
When you click Save, yet another alert box appears, double-checking to make
sure it’s okay to replace the existing, empty Photoshop file you created in Step 2.
When you click OK this last time, Photoshop actually saves your still image and
returns you to Premiere.
Edit Pictures with Photoshop Elements
As mentioned above, Premiere Elements and Photoshop Elements share a com-
mon helper program called Elements Organizer, which displays your media as
thumbnails. The menus and tools in the Organizer are similar to those in Pre-
miere and Photoshop, so this threesome makes a great team. You’ll learn more
about the Organizer in the next chapter, which is all about tags, albums, and, well,
organizing. For this section on still images, it’s helpful to know that you can use the
Organizer to open and edit still images.
To open Elements Organizer from Premiere, click Premiere’s Organize tab, and then
click the Organizer button. It may take a few seconds to launch. When that’s done,
you see video clips, stills, and other media displayed as thumbnail images. Click on
an image to select it, and you can apply any of the quick fixes under the Fix tab. If
your image needs more than the quick fixes available in the Organizer, right-click the
image and choose Full Edit from the pop-up menu. That opens Photoshop Ele-
ments, where you can make more extensive changes. If you want to add an image
that’s in the Organizer to your Premiere project, just drag the thumbnail from the

Chapter 3: Import Sound, Still Pictures, and Animation

Organizer onto the Media panel (Organize tab ➝Media) or the Project panel (Orga-
nize tab ➝ Project.
This sharing between Premiere Elements and Photoshop Elements is very handy
and works both ways. Using Photoshop, you can create fancy images, titles, and
menus for your movies. Using Premiere, you can snag individual frames from your
video and then make them even better-looking using Photoshop and its bundle of
photo fixes. Using Photoshop Elements, you can create a slide show, complete with
captions and transitions. Then you can send the project over to Premiere for more
editing, video effects, and burning to a DVD. Elements Organizer is your central
station for organizing and opening media files in either program.
Note: For a complete guide to Photoshop Elements, get hold of Barbara Brundage’s Photoshop Ele-
ments 8: The Missing Manual.
Import Animation
Unlike videos, which feature live action, animations are drawings played back-to-
back. Think Toy Story, WALL-E, and Up.
Premiere isn’t the only kid on the block when it comes to creating moving pic-
tures. Other programs animate images, too. Adobe Flash, for example, outputs a
series of images for animation. Even the lowly GIF file, described on page 89, was
designed to hold multiple images so it could display simple animations (like the
ones that annoy you on web pages).
Figure 3-16:
When you use
Photoshop’s Place
command, the image
you select is
automatically sized to fit
the frame size. You don’t
have to worry about all
those numerical details.
As icing on the cake, the

the “video safe” and
“title safe” areas, as

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Import Animation
Animations are made up of many files displayed one after the other, and their indi-
vidual file names reflect their serial nature. For example, an animation might
include files with names like Horse_Running_001.PNG, Horse_Running_002.
PNG, Horse_Running_003.PNG, and so on. Because animations play back at the
standard rate of 30 frames for each second of video, you’re talking about a lot of
Horse_Running images.
Note: You can download a short animation for use with this example. The file car_go.zip is included in
the Missing CD for this book (http://missingmanuals.com/cds).
Here are the steps to import an animation that consists of sequenced images:
1. In Premiere, click the Organize tab, and then click Get Media.
You see the familiar grouping of icons that represent camcorders, still cameras,
and PC files and folders.
2. Click PC Files and Folders.
The Add Media window opens.
3. Navigate to the folder that holds the sequence of images that make up the
animation.
The filenames must be identical except for the number on the end. For exam-
ple, here are a group of PNG files that are part of an animation: Horse_
Running_001.PNG, Horse_Running_002.PNG, Horse_Running_003.PNG.
4. Select the first image in the animation sequence, and then turn on the Num-
bered Stills checkbox.
When you select a numbered image, the Numbered Stills checkbox at the bottom
of the Add Media window is activated—meaning it’s not grayed out and you
can click it (Figure 3-17).
5. Click Open.
Premiere finds all the images in the sequence and converts them into a single
sequence that you can use in your project. In the Media panel (Organize tab ➝
Media) you see a single still image, but in the Project panel (Organize tab ➝
Project) you see that Premiere turned all the numbered stills into an movie clip.

Chapter 3: Import Sound, Still Pictures, and Animation

Tips for Creating Animations in Other Programs
You can create sequences of animated images from many graphics programs, includ-
ing nearly the entire stable of Adobe professional graphics programs: After Effects,
Fireworks, Flash, and Photoshop. There are a few things to keep in mind when you
create these images. Still images used in an animation sequence can’t include layers.
So, if you’re using a program like Photoshop CS4, you need to “flatten” any images
you want to use in a sequence. Also, you want the frame size and aspect ratio of your
animation to match your video project. Programs such as Photoshop CS4 have pre-
sets that will help you create graphics that match video standards.

To add a sequence of still
images that make up an
animation, use the Get

Organize Your Clips
As you edit more and more projects in Premiere, it won’t be long before you’re
overwhelmed with video and other media clips. In fact, all it takes to get there are a
couple of vacations, some family celebrations, and maybe a school project or two.
Suffering from media overload, you click Premiere’s Organize tab and scroll
through tons of clips but can’t find the one you want. What you need is a way to
organize your media files.
You’ve come to the right place. This chapter introduces you to a tool that helps
you tame your growing media collection: Adobe’s Elements Organizer, a high-
powered, standalone program that comes with Premiere Elements. (Don’t confuse
Elements Organizer with the simpler Organize tab in Premiere; to understand the
differences, see page 100.)
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to rate your clips, apply searchable tags to them,
and organize them into albums. All these techniques make it easy to find the clip
you need when you’re in the midst of editing.
Of course, when you’re eager to start splicing clips together to create a movie,
organizing clips may seem like a tedious waste of time. It’s actually the opposite.
Spend a few minutes tagging clips and arranging your videos in albums, and your
projects will go much faster. Not only that, three years from now, when you want
to see that clip of your basset hound Clementine next to a Sequoia in Yosemite
National Park, you’ll actually be able to find it.

Application
The Organizer Application
From the outset, you should understand that the standalone program called Ele-
ments Organizer and the tab in Premiere Elements called “Organize” are two dif-
ferent beasts. Yes, they perform similar functions, and yes, their names are
confusingly similar, but of the two, Elements Organizer is much more powerful.
Why the duplication? Well, previous versions of Premiere Elements didn’t use
Elements Organizer; it was a part of Photoshop Elements, Adobe’s photo-editing
program. Adobe decided that, with Version 8 of both programs, they could share
the same media library. So if you install either Premiere Elements or Photoshop
Elements on your computer, you also install Elements Organizer.
Now, if that isn’t confusing enough, Elements Organizer also has a tab called
“Organize.” This chapter focuses mostly on Elements Organizer as a standalone
application. Just keep in mind that, in this chapter and in the rest of the book, the
term Organizer (with an “r” at the end) means Elements Organizer, the standalone
tool. When the book refers to the Organize tab, the text will make it clear whether
it’s referring to Premiere Elements or Elements Organizer.
On to the Organizer
You launch the Organizer in one of two ways. From Premiere’s splash screen, click
the Organize button (yes, incredibly enough, Adobe refers to the Organizer as
“Organize” on this screen—go figure). If you’re working within Premiere, go to its
Organize tab and then click the Organizer button near the top-right corner.
Note: It doesn’t help the Organizer/Organize confusion that the Organize button in the splash screen
leads to the Elements Organizer program. When you use it, just focus on the Organizer icon and don’t
think about the missing “r.”
No matter how you launch the Organizer, it provides a slightly different view of
your media clips and slightly different tools than Premiere’s Organize tab does—
see Figure 4-1. And when you look closely, you see that there are major differences
between the two. For example, you can create and apply keyword tags using the
Organizer, but not in Premiere’s Organize tab. And you can create Albums in the
Organizer, but not from Premiere. Use the Organizer application to sort, group,
and manage your ever-growing collection of media. Use Premiere’s Organize tab
to view your media as you edit video.
Tour the Organizer
The Organizer displays miniature versions of all the media files you import—videos,
photos, and songs—neatly arranged in rows and columns. The screen actually
looks like a photographer’s lightbox, which makes sense given the Organizer’s

Chapter 4: Organize Your Clips

The Organizer
Application
roots as an image-organizing tool for Photoshop Elements (in fact, this book will
refer to the Organizer’s main screen as “the lightbox”). Adobe refers to this collec-
tion of media as your catalog.
At the top of the Organizer screen, a menu bar provides commands for importing
and viewing your clips. Choose File ➝Get Photos and Video, for example, to
import media from your camcorder or computer. Under the Organizer’s Find
menu, you see unique ways to view your clips (for example, by file type or by
date). Need to hunt down that video of a hummingbird you snapped 7 months
ago? No problem.
A search box sits below the menu bar, along with a slider that enlarges or reduces
your thumbnail images.
On the right side of the lightbox, you see a Tasks panel with four tabs (Figure 4-2):
• Organize. Because a primary function of the Organizer is to classify your clips,
you’ll spend most of your time here. You can rate your clips (from zero to five
stars), attach key words to them so you can search them later, and group them
into albums. All these techniques help you quickly find the media you need as
you edit a project.
• Fix. Use the Fix tab to touch up still images. It includes options like Auto Color
to correct a picture’s color balance and contrast, Auto Contrast to improve an
image’s contrast without affecting its color, and Auto Red Eye Fix.

• Create. Look at the Create tab, and you can see the Organizer’s still-photo
roots. Most of the options handle projects like photo books, calendars, and
greeting cards. As a videographer, the buttons you’re likely to use are Slide
Show, InstantMovie, and DVD with Menus. When you click on the latter two,
the Organizer sends you to Premiere. For example, if you click InstantMovie,
the Organizer launches Premiere and opens its InstantMovie panel.
• Share. The Share tab includes options to burn DVDs and BluRay discs and
upload videos online. Again, either option sends you to Premiere.

Organize tab most often, to
tag clips and collect them into

Import Media to the Organizer
Although any media you import through Premiere automatically appears in the
Organizer, being able to import video, sound files, and still photos directly into the
Organizer itself is handy, because it’s the same program you use to categorize that
media—to rate and tag it and assign it to albums. You can import media from
many sources, like camcorders and still cameras, or you can import media that’s
already on your computer. (The one thing the Organizer doesn’t provide is “Device
Control,” so, if you want to import video from a tape-based DV or HDV cam-
corder, you must use Premiere Elements and the steps described on page 44.)
Import Media from a Camera
Here are the steps to import media from a tapeless camcorder directly into the
Organizer:
1. Connect your camcorder to your PC.
Some camcorders use a USB cable. Others, such as the new mini-camcorders
like the Flip line of cameras, have a USB connector built right into the camera.
2. In the Organizer, choose File ➝Get Photo and Videos ➝From Camera or
Card Reader.
The Organizer’s Photo Downloader window opens. This window works just like
Premiere’s media downloader described on page 58.
3. Click the Select a Device menu and choose your camcorder.
Your camcorder looks like a removable storage device to Windows and the
Organizer. It even has a drive letter, like E: or F:.
4. (Optional) Click the Advanced Dialog button to select individual clips.
To import all the media on your camcorder, skip this step. If you want to pick
and choose individual files, click the Advanced Dialog button to see them listed,
as shown in Figure 4-3. Check the boxes under the clips you want to import.
5. Click Get Media.
The Organizer copies clips from your camcorder to your computer. The
imported media appears in the Organizer and in Premiere’s Organize tab, too.
Note: For more tips on using the Photo Downloader’s file renaming and metadata features, see the
description of the Media Downloader on page 58.

Import Media from PC Files and Folders
To grab media on your computer in a file or folder, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer, choose File ➝Get Photo and Videos ➝From Files and Folders
(Figure 4-4).
The Get Photos and Videos Files and Folders window opens as shown in
Figure 4-5. As an alternative, Ctrl+Shift+G also opens this window.
2. Select the files or folders you want to import.
Select a folder to import all the media inside of it or double-click the folder to
choose individual files within it. The usual selection tricks work to select multi-
ple files:
• Click to select. Shift-click to select adjacent files.
• Ctrl-click to select/deselect more than one file.
• Click and drag to box in and import a bunch of files at once.

Change Views in the Organizer
When you work on a project and have only 20 media clips to deal with, you might
not need the Organizer’s help. When you’ve got 200 clips, you’re beginning to
appreciate the problem. And when you’ve got 2,000 or more clips in several differ-
ent projects, you’re desperate for a way to order your clips. Organizer to the rescue!
Here’s how it works:
1. From Premiere’s splash screen, click the Organize button to launch the Orga-
nizer. Alternatively, within Premiere itself, click the Organize tab and then
click the Organizer button to launch the Organizer.
The Organizer displays your catalog, all the media you’ve imported, in other
words. If you added photos to the Organizer from Photoshop Elements, you’ll
see those here, too.
UP TO SPEED
The Elements Organizer Philosophy
As you work in either Premiere Elements or Photoshop Ele-
ments, it helps to understand why Adobe made a third pro-
gram, Elements Organizer, common to both programs. You
might call the company’s rationale the Elements Organizer
Philosophy. It goes something like this: Since media files
are big, you don’t want to have multiple copies of the same
file stashed in folders all over your computer or network
hard drives. That’s a huge waste of space, and it can lead to
trouble if you update one copy of the file but not another;
you might inadvertently use the unimproved copy in a
project.
So Adobe decided you should keep just a single copy of
your media. So far, so good. But if you do that, you need a
way for Premiere and Photoshop to know where those files
are. Enter Elements Organizer, the central registry for your
media file locations.
The Organizer keeps track of your media no matter where
you store it. It could be in folders on your computer or on
some other computer on your network. In fact, you can
keep your media on removable hard drives, CDs, or DVDs.
As long as you add your media via the Organizer (and thus
“register” it), Premiere or Photoshop can always find it
because they consult the Organizer for the location.
The Organizer also tracks all sorts of other details about
your clips, including keyword tags, smart tags, assigned
albums, projects, dates, and file sizes. Using this info, the
Organizer can locate and display the clips you want for a
project and hide the ones you don’t—a process called filter-
ing. The Organizer offers a lot of ways to filter your clips, as
you’ll see in this chapter.
The Organizer Philosophy works pretty well, but you do
have to follow some of the standard practices to make it
work. First of all, if you keep all your media in one giant
pool, use tags and albums as organizational tools so you
can easily find the clips you need. It’s also important that
you use the tools in the Organizer to move media from one
folder location to another. For example, suppose you get a
new humongous hard drive for all your video clips. If you
use Windows Explorer to move your clips to the new drive,
the Organizer won’t know where they are. Instead, you
should move your media using the tools in the Organizer,
as explained on page 107.

Chapter 4: Organize Your Clips

Application
2. If displayed, click the Show All button.
The Show All button appears only if you filtered the lightbox view earlier in the
same work session. So if you were working in the lightbox in a filtered view (like
View ➝Photos), switched windows to complete another task, and then came
back to the lightbox, the filter remains in place. In such a case, you have to click
Show All to see all your files. But every time you quit the Organizer program,
the lightbox resets to Show All. The only thing is, you won’t see the Show All
button because the Organizer displays all your files by default.
3. Use the Display menu to sort and view your clips in different ways.
Click the Display button in the upper-right corner of the Organizer. Here’s a
rundown of the views available from the drop-down menu:
Thumbnail View (Ctrl+Alt+1) is the standard view. It displays miniature ver-
sions of all your media—video clips, images, and songs. Everything is in one big
pool, which is great for tagging clips and creating albums.
Import Batch (Ctrl+Alt+2) Organizes your clips according to the dates you
imported them to the Organizer.
Folder Location (Ctrl+Alt+3) opens a Windows Explorer-like sidebar to the left
of the lightbox that displays the folders on your computer. You’re probably
used to clicking a folder to see the files inside. The Organizer doesn’t work that
way—in fact, it’s just the opposite. When you’re in this view, click a file in the
lightbox and the sidebar on the left displays the folder it’s in.
Think of this view as a tool to tell you where your clips are on your computer.
It’s part of the all-in-one-big-pool Elements Organizer philosophy. If you want
to move a clip, you can drag it from the lightbox to a different folder. As men-
tioned earlier, you don’t want to use Windows to move media you import. If
you do, the Organizer loses track of the file. Instead, use this view to move clips
from one folder to another.
Date View (Ctrl+Alt+D) displays a calendar that highlights the dates on which
you imported files. You can change the display to view the calendar by year,
month, or day. Click on a highlighted date to preview that day’s imported
media.
View, Edit, Organize in Full Screen (F11). In this view, most of the Organizer
tools disappear to give you a great full-screen view of your media. You get a
limited number of tools in collapsible menus on the left side of the screen for
editing (Smart Fix and Auto Color, for example) and organizing (Add to
Album and Add Keyword) your media. To return to the standard view, hit Esc.
Compare Photos Side by Side (F12). You see the same full-screen view described
above, except that the Organizer displays two photos or video thumbnails side
by side. You can preselect the images you want to compare (use Ctrl-click), or

you can change the images once you’re inside the view. Click the image and use
the arrow buttons that pop up along the bottom of the screen to navigate
through your media collection.
4. You can show and hide specific types of media in the Organizer’s lightbox (just
as you can in the Organize tab of Premiere).
For example, to see only video and audio files, choose View ➝Media Types and
deselect Photos, Projects, and PDF, making sure that just Video and Audio are
selected.
As you can see in Figure 4-6, each filter has a shortcut key, which is faster than
using the menu:
Photos: Ctrl+1
Videos: Ctrl+2
Audio: Ctrl+3
Projects: Ctrl+4
PDF: Ctrl+5
5. Near the top-center of the window, click and drag the slider to resize your
thumbnail images.
Drag the slider to the right to display larger but fewer thumbnails, and to the
left to display smaller but more thumbnails.
6. Click the Date menu next to the slider to sort thumbnails by date.
The Date menu has two options: Date (Newest First) and Date (Oldest First).
Newest First zeroes in on the most recent batch of clips you imported. Oldest first
is helpful when you view clips that follow a logical timeline, such as a wedding or
birthday party—you can review the clips in the order you captured them.
Figure 4-6:
You can show and hide different types of media
using either a menu command or the shortcut
keys shown here.

7. Next to the Date menu, turn on the Details checkbox.
When you select Details, additional information shows up beneath each clip
(providing your thumbnails are large enough). This information includes the
clip’s star rating (page 109), keyword tags (page 113), smart tags (page 120),
album icons (page 126), capture date, and file name.
You won’t see tag and album icons until you apply them to your clips, of
course, which you’ll learn to do a little later in this chapter. If you can’t see the
file names, make sure the thumbnail slider is set large enough to display them,
and check to see that the filenames display is turned on by choosing View ➝
Show Filenames. (While you’re in the View menu, it’s worth noting that you
can show and hide file details by choosing View ➝Details or using the shortcut
Ctrl+D.)
8. If you see a scroll bar on the right of the lightbox, you can use it (or the scroll
wheel on your mouse) to maneuver through your clips.
Drag the scroll bar up or down to move quickly. Click the arrows at the top and
bottom of the bar to move one row at a time.
You can drag the bar that separates the lightbox and the Task panel left and
right to change the space available to your thumbnails. The same is true for the
horizontal bar between the Albums and Keyword Tags panels. If either of those
panels is closed, click the triangle button next to its name.
9. Use the search box that sits below the menu bar to execute a search.
For example, type in a few letters from one of your clips’ filenames. When you
press Enter, the Organizer limits the media it displays to files that match the
word or characters you entered.
The Organizer looks at more than file names when it searches; it searches album
names, keyword tags, smart tags, and dates. As it searches, it tells you what it’s
searching for, like “Find: Items matching 10/12/2009.”
10.In the upper-left corner, click the blue Back arrow.
The view changes to the previous view, filtered by the date. Click the back but-
ton again, and you see the view before it was filtered by the date. You can use
the Back and Forward arrows to move through your view history.
Now that you have some viewing tips and tricks under your belt, it’s a great time to
learn how to rate and filter clips, also known as filtering your catalog.
Rank Your Clips with Star Ratings
Suppose you spend a day shooting buffalo—with your camcorder, that is. Back
home, you import your clips and you’re ready to edit. But it’s hard to tell the good
buffalo clips from the bad ones when all you see is a thumbnail still of each clip.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Rank Your Clips
with Star Ratings
As much as you want to jump in and start working on a project right away, take a
little time to winnow the good clips from the bad by ranking them. Premiere gives
you a quick and easy way to do so: star ratings. In the Organizer lightbox, five little
ghosted-out stars appear under each clip (or image or song). As you play each clip,
click on one of the stars to rate it.
Here’s a proven strategy for figuring out how to rate a clip: On the first pass, sepa-
rate usable clips from unusable ones by giving the former a single star and the latter
no stars. Then filter your view of the clips to hide those you deemed unusable: in
the Organizer, click one star in the Ratings filter at the top-right of the lightbox. As
you continue to review and compare clips, upgrade the ratings on the usable clips
to good and maybe even great by applying two, three, or more stars. (Later, if you
feel you were too generous or too stingy, you can come back and change the rating.)
While this may seem like a tedious process at first, it saves tons of time in the long
run because you can filter your clips by star rating as you edit your project. That
way, you won’t be reviewing bad clips. For example, if you only want to see buf-
falo clips with a rating of three stars or better, click the appropriate star in the Ratings
filter (Figure 4-7).
In practice, of course, you’ll probably work on all types of video projects—some
serious, some frivolous. So let the nature of your project determine how much
time you spend reviewing and rating clips. If it’s a serious project, you may want to
take several passes through each clip. On the other hand, if your project is a quick-
and-dirty YouTube video, forgo the multiple-pass rating and upgrade and downgrade
clips as you work with them.
Apply Star Ratings
Rating your clips couldn’t be easier. Just click one of the five stars under the clip.
Star-rating a clip works the same way whether you’re in the Organizer or Pre-
miere’s Organize tab. (The steps below describe the process within the Organizer.)
Figure 4-7:
After you apply star
ratings to individual
clips, you can use the
Organizer’s Star Ratings
filter (in the upper-right
corner of the lightbox) to
hide the clips that don’t
meet your standards.
Applying a star rating
and filtering by a rating
is simply a matter of
clicking on the
appropriate star. Star
ratings appear in both
the Organizer and
Premiere’s Organize tab.

Rank Your Clips

Before you preview clips and apply star ratings, you may want to filter the catalog
so that it displays only clips from, say, the great buffalo shoot or your most recent
project. You can sort files using the Organizer’s menu bar or drop-down menus at
the top of the screen. So you can, for example, sort files by selecting “Date (Newest
First)” in the drop-down menu, or you can choose Find ➝By History ➝Imported
on to display clips added on a specific date. (Fortunately, you don’t have to rely on
your memory for the date. As shown in Figure 4-8, the Organizer presents a handy
window that lists the dates you imported media, along with some other details.)
Once you’ve got the right clips in the lightbox, follow these steps to preview your
videos and apply star ratings:
1. Right-click the first clip, and then choose View Photos and Video in Full Screen.
The Organizer window displays the clip in Full Screen mode, as shown in
(Figure 4-9). Along the right side of the monitor, a film strip displays your
media. At the bottom, a toolbox has controls for playing clips and for showing
and hiding the other panels. Move your mouse to the left side of the screen, and
a Quick Edit panel pops out, displaying different tools and, in the top-left corner,
the star rating.
2. Click the Play button.
You may want to play a clip a couple of times before you decide what rating to
give it—and whether you even want to use it. But keep in mind that you don’t
have to use an entire clip. You may want to use just a portion of it, so don’t
throw out a clip with good sections in it. As you’ll see later in this chapter, Pre-
miere offers some help in assessing your clips with its Auto-Analyzer feature,
but for now, you’re the one who knows what you want from your video. Review
the clip as many times as needed to star-rate it.
Figure 4-8:
This handy window shows you the source of the
media clips, the date and time you imported
them, and how many clips you added to the
catalog. Choose one of the dates, and the
lightbox shows you the clips.

with Star Ratings
3. If the clip is acceptable, move your mouse over the Quick Edit palette and click
the one-star rating.
The rating displays as one big gold star and four ghosted-out stars. It appears in
the Organizer and Premiere’s Organize tab. You can use the star rating to filter
your clip catalog in both programs.
It’s hard to judge one video clip compared to another, especially if you haven’t
seen all the clips yet. That’s why it makes sense to set the bar low on your first
pass. Don’t give any stars to the really bad clips. Give acceptable clips a one- or
two-star rating. As you pare down the clips and re-review the rated ones, you
can elevate the better clips to a higher rating.
4. Repeat the process for all the media clips.
Depending on how much video you shot, it can be a little tedious to view each
and every clip more than once. Just keep in mind that the time you spend now
will save you lots of time later on. At this stage, your primary mission is to elim-
inate all the truly bad clips. You won’t ever have to watch that bad video again.

Get a Good View
There’s more than one way to preview video clips in the Organizer and in Pre-
miere, and you may find that one tool works better than another for your video
format. So, if the Organizer’s Full Screen view gives you fuzzy clips or the playback
stutters, try one of these options for previewing and rating clips:
1. In the Organizer’s lightbox, right-click the clip and choose Play Video or
Audio to open the media player.
2. Click Play to preview the clip.
3. Close the media player by clicking the X button in the upper-right corner.
4. In the lightbox, set a star rating for the clip. If you don’t see stars under the
thumbnails in the lightbox, press Ctrl+D to show details.
5. Choose the next clip and repeat the process.
Preview and Rate in Premiere
If neither of the Organizer methods works for you, try previewing and rating your
clips using Premiere. Follow these steps:
1. In Premiere, click the Organize tab and then click the Media button to display
your clips.
2. Set the Media Arrangement menu to show Newest First.
3. Turn on the Details check box to display the star rating for clips (Figure 4-10).
4. Double-click a clip to open it in the Preview window.
5. If necessary, drag one of the edges of the Preview window to resize it.
6. Click play to Preview the clip.
7. Close the media player by clicking the X button in the upper-right corner.
8. Click a star under the clip to set the star rating.
9. Choose the next clip and repeat the process.
Apply Keyword Tags to Clips
The star rating system doesn’t specify much detail about the contents of a clip; it
simply lets you broadly label a clip as relatively good or bad. Keyword tags,
described in this section, and smart tags, up next, give you the opportunity to be
more specific.
When you look at media files in the Organizer or in Premiere’s Organize tab, all
you see is a still frame of a clip. You may wonder who’s in the clip, where was it
shot, when was it shot, and probably half a dozen other questions.

114
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Apply Keyword
Tags to Clips
Tags give you a way to describe your clips in more detail than star ratings do, and
they can answer important questions like those above. Once you tag your clips,
you’ve got a powerful way to zero in on just the clip you need. Get used to work-
ing with keyword tags, and you can really cut through the media clutter.
Here’s an example: Suppose you travel the country with your faithful basset hound
Clementine and fussy Siamese cat Jasmine. Naturally, you shoot video every step of
the way. As you import the video into the Organizer, you tag all the Clementine
clips with her name and do the same for Jasmine. You also tag clips by location,
like Yosemite National Park, the Grand Canyon, and Mississippi. You can apply
multiple tags to clips, so some clips might end up with three tags: Clementine, Jas-
mine, and Grand Canyon. Then, as you edit your project, it’s easy to apply filters
so you see, for example, only those clips with both Clementine and Jasmine at the
Grand Canyon.
You can filter your view in either the Organizer or Premiere’s Organize tab using
keyword tags. However, to create and apply tags to clips, you have to be in the
Organizer. Here’s how you do that:
Figure 4-10:
Depending on your clips’

1. If you’re in Premiere Elements, click the Organize tab and then click the Orga-
nizer button. Alternatively, click the Organize button from Premiere’s splash
screen.
The Organizer application opens, showing your media in the lightbox, with the
tabbed Tasks panel on the right and the Organize tab selected. It displays
Albums at the top and Keyword Tags below, as shown in Figure 4-11. You’ll
learn about albums in more detail beginning on page 126, but for the time
being, it’s helpful to know that they’re simply another way to group clips.
Initially, the Organizer displays all your media files. Before you apply keyword
tags, you can use filters to bring the number of clips down to a more manage-
able quantity. The next steps describe your options.
2. Click the Show All button, if available.
When you do so, the Show All button disappears and the Organizer displays all
the media in your catalog. As you learned above, the Show All button appears
only if you filtered the lightbox view earlier in the same work session.

3. In the Albums panel, choose the project or album that has the files you wish to tag.
You can choose only one project or album at a time. When you click on a name,
the Organizer displays only the media for that project or album.
Projects are described on page 13. Albums are covered in more detail on page 126.
4. (Optional) To sort your media by star rating, click a star in the upper-right
corner of the lightbox and then choose an option from the menu.
After you click one of the stars, you can choose “and higher”, “and lower”, or
“only” from the drop-down menu. For example, to see all the clips with a three-
star or better rating, click on the third ghosted star to highlight it, and make
sure “and higher” is selected in the menu.
5. Select the clips you want to tag.
If you’re tagging a single clip, you don’t need to make a selection first—just
drag the tag to the clip. If you want to tag several clips at once, you can use any
of the usual multiple-selection techniques:
• Ctrl-click to select multiple clips.
• Shift-click to select a range of adjacent clips.
• Click and drag a selection box to select a group of clips.
6. Select one or more tags.
Premiere provides several categories and sub-categories of tags. For example,
you can select the People category and tag clips with subcategories that include
Family and Friends.
If you want to apply multiple tags to the selected clips, Ctrl-click or Shift-click
to highlight the tags.
7. Drag one of the selected tags to one of the selected clips, as shown in
Figure 4-12.
The Organizer applies the selected tags to all the selected clips.
By selecting multiple clips and applying multiple tags, you can speed up your tag-
ging chores.
Create a New Keyword Tag
You’re not limited to the Organizer’s tags, however. You can create your own. For
example, within the Family sub-category, you might want to create a tag for indi-
vidual family members. Then, you can not only find all the clips with Amy in
them, but you can also find all the clips that have Amy, Mary, and Joyce together.

Chapter 4: Organize Your Clips
117
Apply Keyword
Tags to Clips
You can only create new tags from within the Organizer. Choose the Organize tab
in the Task panel. If the Keyword Tags panel is closed, click the triangle button to
open it. You can display tags two ways: Tag Hierarchy (click the button that looks
like a TV screen with a tag beside it) or Tag Cloud (click the cloud with the big “T”
on it). The Tag Hierarchy displays tags you can checkmark to narrow your view to
clips that have that tag. The Cloud view displays tags as a word list; click a word to
sort by that tag.
When you create a new tag, it’s easier to use Tag Hierarchy because you can see the
main categories (People, Places, and so on) and their sub-categories (Family and
Friends under People, for example).
To create a new tag, click the big green + button to open a menu with several
options:
• New Keyword Tag. This opens the Create Keyword Tag panel (Figure 4-13)
where you have a few options. Click the Edit Icon button to choose a label, color,
and icon for the new tag. Premiere displays this icon on the clip’s still frame, so it
provides a quick reference as you edit. For example, if you create a tag for your
basset hound Clementine, you might use her picture as the icon image.
Figure 4-12:
To apply tags to more than one clip,
preselect the clips and then drag the
tag onto one of the selected clips.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Apply Keyword
Tags to Clips
Next, you have to tell Premiere where, in the list of all the tags, to put this new
tag. Use the Category drop-down menu to position it as a sub-category of an
existing tag. For example, to add a tag for Clementine under “Pets”, choose the
Pets category. Then, when you create the tag by clicking the OK button, “Clem-
entine” shows up under “Pets”, replete with a little picture of your hound dog
in the tag.
You may also choose to place your tag on a map and provide additional notes
about the tag.
• New Sub-Category. This option is really a subset of the New Keyword Tag
option; it also lets you create and position a new tag. The difference is that here
you can’t specify a tag color or image. Your new sub-category adopts the tag
characteristics of the parent category. So if you add a sub-category to Events, it
shows up as a red tag with a couple of ersatz lines of text in it.
You might wonder, if New Sub-Category does the same thing as the option
above, why is it here at all? That’s because New Sub-Category lets you set up a
tag without specifying a tag color or icon image. If you know you’re going to
shoot footage of a vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, for example, you can set up a
tag in the Event sub-category called “Martha’s Vineyard Vacation” so it’s all
ready for you when you return.
Figure 4-13:
This new tag for
Clementine is a sub-
category of “Pets”. You
can customize the look of
a tag by clicking the Edit
Icon button.

Chapter 4: Organize Your Clips
119
Apply Keyword
Tags to Clips
If you choose this option, the Create Sub-Category panel opens as shown in
Figure 4-14. At the top, type in the tag name in the Sub-Category Name box.
Then, in the Category drop-down menu, choose a parent category or existing
sub-category from the list.
• New Category. In Elements lingo, a “category” is the top level of keyword tags.
People, Places, and Events all represent categories, for example. Everything else
belongs to a sub-category.
To create a new top-level tag, choose this option, name the category, and then
choose a tag color and icon.
Tip: After you create a keyword tag, you may decide that you put it in the wrong category. If so, in the
Organizer’s Keyword Tags panel, simply drag the tag to a new category.
Remove Keyword Tags
As you work on projects, you may change your mind about a keyword tag. No
problem, you can remove a tag with a couple of clicks. Right-click the blue key-
word tag under a clip and a menu pops up with options like “Remove Clementine
Keyword Tag.” Click on the tag you want to remove, and Premiere deletes it
instantly—you won’t see an alert box to double-check your intentions, so be fore-
warned. As an alternative, you can right-click on a thumbnail and then choose
Remove Keyword Tag. This method displays a submenu with both the keyword
tags and the smart tags described later.
Tip: You can use the Remove Tag feature to see just what tags Premiere applied to a clip. Follow the
steps above, but don’t click on a tag (otherwise, you’ll remove it). Just click away from the menu by plac-
ing your cursor elsewhere on the screen and left-clicking.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Apply Smart Tags to
Clips
Apply Smart Tags to Clips
In addition to keyword tags, Premiere offers another type of tag, called a smart tag.
Smart tags don’t know anything about you, your basset hound, or, unfortunately,
upcoming Lotto numbers. They simply reflect Premiere’s assessment of the quality
of a video clip. Ask Premiere to analyze a clip, and it identifies problems like shaky
camera work, low light, and inaudible audio. It lets you know about the good things
in your clips, too, with tags such as High Quality and In Focus. It then labels the clip
with these assessments, and those labels become purple smart tags under your media
clips. So, how do smart tags help you when you edit video? It’s like having an assis-
tant who pre-screens your clips and flags the good and bad parts.
Premiere smart-tags your clips using a tool called Auto-Analyzer. Auto-Analyzer
doesn’t simply look at each clip as a single object—it actually analyzes your foot-
age frame by frame, looking for specific deficiencies and attributes (see Figure 4-16
for the complete list). You can’t create or add your own smart tag definitions,
however.
Premiere uses smart tags in a number of ways. For example, if you attempt to use
footage tagged as dark or low-contrast, Premiere asks if you want to apply Auto
Contrast to improve the clip. And if you choose Premiere’s InstantMovie option, it
uses the smart tags to select footage, create transitions, and apply effects.
As part of the smart-tagging process, Auto-Analyzer detects dramatic image
changes in the video and, based on that, divides each clip into multiple scenes. For
details on these newly created scenes, go to page 124.
Smart-Tag with Auto-Analyzer
You can run Auto-Analyzer from the Organizer or from inside Premiere, and you
can analyze either a single or multiple clips at once (to analyze multiple clips, use
the multiple-clip selection process described on page 116).
To start Auto-Analyzer in either the Organizer or Premiere, right-click the selected
clip or clips and choose Run Auto-Analyzer from the shortcut menu. A small win-
dow displays a progress bar like the one in Figure 4-15, along with status messages
such as “Detecting scenes” and “Analyzing media.” If it’s taking too long or you
change your mind, click Cancel to stop the analysis.
Figure 4-15:
As Auto-Analyzer runs, it details
its progress. Each clip requires a
couple of passes to detect scenes
and analyze the quality of the
video and sound.

Chapter 4: Organize Your Clips
121
Apply Smart Tags to
Clips
You might expect Premiere to display a report once it finishes analyzing your clip,
but it doesn’t. Instead, it adds a purple smart tag to the lower-right corner of your
clip. To see the results of the analysis, hold your cursor over the smart tag, and a
tooltip lists the tags Auto-Analyzer applied. You can see the full list of smart tags in
Figure 4-16.
Figure 4-16:
Premiere has a fixed list of smart tags it applies when
Auto-Analyzer examines your clips (you can’t add your
own tags to the process, by the way). This table shows the

Apply Smart Tags During Capture
You can analyze and smart-tag your clips as you capture video, too, but only through
Premiere and only with footage from a DV camcorder or an HDV camcorder (see
page 44) or a webcam (you can’t auto-analyze video from an AVCHD camcorder, a
mobile phone, or a PC file; to analyze those files, see the section below).
Under Premiere’s Organize tab, click Get Media and select either DV or HDV
camcorder or webcam as your video source. A window of capture and smart-
tagging options appears, as shown in Figure 4-17. Click the Auto-Analyzer option.
If you want to pick and choose which characteristics Premiere analyzes, click the
triangle beside the Analyze label and select from Motion, Faces, Blur, Brightness
and Contrast, Shake, Audio, and Object Motion.
Apply Smart Tags From the Organizer
If you import video from a DVD or AVCHD camcorder, a digital still camera, or a
mobile phone, or if you add clips using PC Folders and Files as a source, you can
only analyze clips after you import them. Select the clips you want to tag, then right-
click one of the clips and choose Run Auto-Analyzer from the shortcut menu.
Figure 4-17:
It’s a good idea to smart-tag your clips as you

Change Smart Tag Options in the Organizer
In most cases, it makes sense to let Auto-Analyzer analyze all the characteristics of
a clip, and when you start out, that’s the way Auto-Analyzer’s set up. Later on, you
may want to look for certain clip qualities. To do that, choose Edit ➝Preferences ➝
Auto-Analyzer Options in the Organizer. The Preferences window opens, as shown
in Figure 4-18. You can choose from major categories such as Audio, Face, and
Object Motion, but you can’t specify the sub-categories, such as Pan and Fast
Zoom In.
Apply Smart Tags Automatically
If you wait impatiently while Auto-Analyzer does its work, you may wonder if there’s
a faster way to do the job. In fact, you can automatically start Auto-Analyzer in a
couple of ways.
When you first install Premiere, the program sets Auto-Analyzer to run automati-
cally whenever you have the Organizer open. Left this way, all the clips in your cat-
alog will eventually sport that snazzy purple tag. That’s a great system so long as it
doesn’t take a toll on Premiere’s performance, such as when you’re trying to play
back a scene or render a clip. If Auto-Analyzer turns out to be a problem, turn it
off. Go to Edit ➝Preferences ➝Auto-Analyzer Options (Figure 4-18). Click the
check mark beside the option “Analyze All Media in Catalog Automatically” to
remove it. If you want to stop the Auto-Analyzer for just a few moments, click the
purple tag in the status bar below the catalog; it acts as a pause button.
Figure 4-18:

you can choose which

Analyzer is set to look at
all of a clip’s
characteristics.

124
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Apply Smart Tags to
Clips
But there’s another option that may work even better: You can run Auto-Analyzer
even when you’re not using the Organizer or Premiere. You can set a preference so
that the program automatically runs when you start up your computer. The idea is
that when your PC isn’t busy doing other things, it spends its spare brainpower
analyzing your videos.
The Organizer normally has this option turned on. To toggle it on or off, go to
Edit ➝Preferences ➝Auto-Analyzer Options and check the box “Run Analyzer on
Start Up”.
Smart-Tagged Video Groups
As you learned earlier, when Auto-Analyzer detects dramatic changes in a video
clip, it breaks the clip into scenes. It assumes that, because the image changed so
abruptly, the subject has also changed. This gives you the opportunity to treat each
auto-analyzed scene as a separate entity. You may want to apply transitions
between the scenes, for example. (Remember, as always, the original clip remains
unchanged. Premiere still stores it as a single video file on your computer.)
You can tell when Auto-Analyzer divided a clip into multiple scenes—the thumb-
nail of the clip sports a thick, light-gray border, and it has an Open Group button
on the right side (see Figure 4-19, top). Click the button and the clip expands into
its multiple scenes (see Figure 4-19, bottom).
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Stack Still Images
If you use a lot of still photos in your projects, at some point
they’re going to clutter up your workspace. One solution is
to group the photos into “stacks.” You can stack multiple
still images under a single picture similar to the way that
Auto-Analyzer tucks several scenes under a single clip
image. Stacking stills is a good way to organize images that
have a common theme, and it reduces the clutter.
To stack stills, select the pictures (make sure there aren’t
any video or audio clips in the selection or it won’t work)
and then right-click one of the stills. Choose Stack ➝Stack
Selected Photos. Once you do, the stacked photos carry the
same visual cues as stacked clips: a hefty light-gray border
and an Open Group button on the right (see Figure 4-20).
You probably want to pick a representative image for the
top of the stack. Expand the stack, right-click any of the stills,
and choose Stack (Image Only) ➝Set As Top Item. When
you close the stack, the chosen image sits at the top of the
pile; it will also occupy the number-one spot when you next
expand the stack.
If you get to the point where you want to unstack the
images, right-click on the stack and choose Stack ➝
Unstack Photos. You can remove individual items from a
stack, too. Expand the stack by clicking on the Expand icon
or by right-clicking a stack and choosing Stack ➝Expand
Photos in Stack. Then select one or more stills you want to
remove. Right-click one of the selected images and choose
Stack ➝ Remove Photo from Stack.
Drag a tag to a closed stack of photos, and Premiere applies
that tag to every photo. On the other hand, if you open the
stack, you can add tags to or remove them from individual
photos.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

If you apply a tag to an Auto-Analyzed clip, Premiere applies the tag to all the
scenes in the clip; you can’t apply a tag to an individual scene.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn all about adding clips to Premiere’s timeline and
sceneline. For now, know that if you want to add all the scenes in a group, make
sure the group is closed and then drag it to the timeline or sceneline. To add just a
single scene from within a group, expand the group and drag the scene. If you hap-
pen to smart tag a clip after you add it to the timeline, it gets divided into separate
scenes in the timeline (Figure 4-21). In the sceneline, the clip is separated into sep-
arate boxes, each holding a scene.
Remove Smart Tags
As you review a clip’s smart tags, you may feel that Auto-Analyzer improperly
tagged a clip. Just as with keyword tags, you can remove a smart tag. Right-click
the clip and, in the menu that pops up, move your cursor over the Remove Tag
option. The clip’s smart tags appear at the bottom of the menu—they have the typ-
ical purple smart tag icon, as shown in (Figure 4-22). Click the tag you want to
remove, and Premiere deletes it immediately—you don’t get a chance to confirm
the cut.
Organize Clips into Albums
Premiere Albums are another great tool for organizing your media. They work
according to the Organizer Philosophy explained on page 106, and they work
exceptionally well.
There’s one important thing to keep in mind when you create an album and add
clips to it. You’re never copying or moving clips from one place to another—from
the Organizer, say, to an album called “Beach Vacation”. You’re just creating links
Figure 4-21:

so that Premiere can display the clips in that album. That way, a single clip of
Clementine can appear in several different albums, such as Clementine’s Favorite
Moments, The Grand Canyon, and Dogs with Long Ears. No matter how many
albums you add Clementine to, there’s still only one Clementine clip.
Create a New Album
You create albums inside the Organizer application. These steps create an album
called “Gone Gobi.”
1. Click the Organize tab.
The Albums panel sits at the top of the Tasks pane. If necessary, click the triangle
button to expand the panel.
2. Click the big green + button and choose New Album.
The panel changes to display Album Details (Figure 4-23).
3. In Album Name, type “Gone Gobi”.
The album name should be descriptive because it’s the only thing you’ll see in
Premiere’s Filter by menu, shown in Figure 4-24.
4. Choose an Album Category from the drop-down menu.
You can collect albums in album groups, described in the next section.
5. Click the Content tab, and then drag clips from the lightbox into the Gone
Gobi album.
You can add clips one at a time or select groups and drag them to the album.
Later, you can add new clips by dragging them on to the album in the Albums
panel.
6. Click Done.
The Album closes and it appears in the Albums panel.
If you want to make changes to your Gone Gobi album later, right-click the album
in the Albums panel and choose Edit Gone Gobi Album. The Album Details panel
described above opens, and you can make your changes.

Create a New Album Category
As your collection of media clips grows, you may want to create groups of albums.
If you shoot a lot of family events, for example, you may create albums for birthdays,
weddings, and graduations. Then, within these albums, you may have sub-albums
for specific events, like Mary Frances’s Wedding and Steve’s Wedding.
Creating album groups is similar to creating a new album. In the albums panel,
click the green + button and choose Create Album Category. Then you see the
Create Album Category dialog box (Figure 4-25), where you name the Album Cat-
egory and, if you like, nest it inside another album category.
Projects vs. Albums
Your video projects show up at the bottom of the album panel, as shown in
Figure 4-24. Technically, these projects aren’t albums, so they have their own cate-
gory and different icons than albums. In Premiere, whenever you drag a clip onto the
sceneline or timeline, that clip gets added to your project file. If you have a project
open in Premiere and you import clips, Premiere adds those clips to that project.
In Premiere, you view the clips in a project by opening the project when you
launch Premiere, clicking the Organize tab, and then clicking the Project button.
In the Organizer, you view the clips in a project by selecting the project in the
Album panel.
Create Smart Albums Automatically
Smart Albums are nifty containers for your clips. You never have to drag clips to
smart albums; all you have to do is tell the Organizer what type of clips to include
in them. You provide a set of rules, which Premiere calls “criteria,” and Smart
Album uses those rules to decide which files to include in which albums. Other
than that, a Smart Album is like any other album. For example, you find your
Smart Albums listed in Premiere in the Select Album menu on the Organize tab.
You create a smart album from the Albums panel. Click the green + button and
then choose New Smart Album. The New Smart Album panel opens as shown in
Figure 4-26. Name the album and then use the drop-down menu to build your set
of inclusion rules. Each rule comprises three parts. First you choose a characteristic
of the clips you want to include, which can be as diverse as a keyword tag, a cap-
ture date, or an author.
Figure 4-25:
To create a new album category, give it a name and choose whether it’s at the top
level or within another album category.

Organize Clips into
Albums
Next you choose a modifier, such as “Starts With” and “Includes”. The modifier
changes depending on the object; for example, if you choose to include clips based
on their keyword tags, the only available modifier is “Includes”.
Finally, in the third menu, you choose the boundaries for the modifier. In the
above example, you’d choose from a list of existing keyword tags. On the other
hand, if you elect to include clips based on their capture date, the modifiers
include: “Is”, “Is before”, “Is after”, and “Is within the last”. After you make your
choice, you then choose a date (“is before 9/25/09”) or time period (“is within the
last 8 days”).
Premiere applies the criteria you establish two ways. You can choose to match
“Any one of the following search criteria” or “All of the following search criteria”.
Once you finish setting up the rules, the Organizer automatically searches your
media and adds it to the album. And if you import or add new media that matches
the criteria, the Organizer automatically adds that, too.
Delete a Smart Album
If the time comes when you no longer need your Puerto Vallarta 2009 Smart
Album, right-click on the album name in the Albums panel and choose Delete
Puerto Vallarta 2009 album from the shortcut menu. An alert box appears, asking
“Are you sure you want to delete this smart album?” Click OK to go through with
it or click Cancel to back out. Naturally, deleting the album doesn’t delete the clips.
They’re still there in your main catalog.
Figure 4-26:
You set the rules for clips
that should appear in a
smart album. Here,
you’re creating the rules
for a smart album
named Puerto Vallarta
2009. The rules state
that, for the Smart Album
feature to include them,
clips must have the
keyword tag “Puerto
Vallarta”, a capture date
within the past 10
months, and an author
name that contains
“Chris”.

Back Up and Synchronize Albums
Adobe’s optional Photoshop.com service can back up your albums (see page 16 for a
detailed description of the Photoshop.com service). The best thing about the service is
that it’s easy, and you don’t have to worry about it too much once you set it up. The
bad thing about it is that video files are big, and, after you fill up 2 GB of space, Adobe
charges you for online storage based on the amount of space you use. You have to
decide whether the convenience outweighs the cost (see page 16 for some help).
Here’s how it works:
• Store the media clips you want to back up in an album.
• In the Albums panel, open Album Details by right-clicking on the album and
choosing Edit.
• Under the Album name, check the Backup/Synchronize box.
Once you enable the Backup/Synchronize option, Premiere automatically copies
the contents of the album to a synonymously named album on Photoshop.com. If
you make a change, like adding or removing clips from the album, Premiere dupli-
cates those changes to the online backup.
Tip: If backing up your video on Photoshop.com sounds too expensive, consider backing up your clips to
an external hard drive, as described on page 136.
Filter Your View Using Star Ratings,
Keyword Tags, Smart Tags, and Albums
Once you star-rate your clips, tag them with one or more keyword or smart tags,
and arrange them in albums, you can use those attributes to filter clips in the
Organizer and, more importantly, in Premiere.
In the Organizer, you see all your clips in the lightbox. In Premiere, you see all
your clips by clicking the Organize tab and then clicking the Media button. In
either view, you can filter the displayed clips by their star rating. For example in
Premiere, use the Rating option and the menu next to it (Figure 4-27) to specify
which clips get displayed.
Suppose you’re looking for video clips of a place called Rancho Nicasio. Of course,
you’ve dutifully applied a keyword tag for Rancho Nicasio after you imported the
video. To see the Rancho Nicasio clips, in the Keyword Tags panel of the Orga-
nizer, click Places to display the tag sub-categories, which include Rancho Nicasio.
When you turn on the checkbox next to Rancho Nicasio, the box displays a pair of
binoculars to indicate you’ve selected that view, and the Organizer shows only the
clips with the Rancho Nicasio tag (Figure 4-28).

132
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Filter Your View
You can also use tags to exclude images from a view. For example, suppose you
want to view all the people shots in your catalog except for those tagged Rancho
Nicasio and, say, Puerto Vallarta. Click the People category, and you see that all
the People sub-category tags sport binoculars to show their images are included.
Right-click the Rancho Nicasio tag and near the bottom of the shortcut menu
choose Exclude photos with Rancho Nicasio sub-category from search results. Your
keyword tags look like Figure 4-29. Hey, it’s a little wordy for a menu option, but it
gets the job done. Repeat the operation for Puerto Vallarta, and you’re all set.
You can include or exclude any combination of filters, and you can use keyword
tag filters along with smart tag, star rating, and album filters.

Shown here in Premiere, a 1 star

To filter your view by smart tag, follow the same procedure but select and deselect

Auto-Analyzer applied to your clips.
You have to sort clips by album or by project. In the Organizer, click on the album

shown in Figure 4-27.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Manage Your
Catalogs
It’s great to be able to fine-tune what appears in the Organizer lightbox using fil-
ters, but you really need the filters as you’re editing in Premiere. Fortunately, you
filter your clips in pretty much the same way there. Go to Premiere’s Organize tab
and click the Select Tag menu. Choose the tags you want to include, and Premiere
displays only media with tags that match (Figure 4-30). The only difference within
Premiere is that you can’t use filters to exclude files.
Manage Your Catalogs
Premiere calls your collection of media—that big giant pool of video clips, sound
clips, and still photos—a “catalog.” If you’re like most people, you probably want
only one catalog. That way, you only have to search one collection for all your
media. Select albums, apply star and tag filters, and you’ll find what you need. On
the other hand, if you’d like to keep your work files in one big pool and all your
family media in another pool, you can create and use two different catalogs.
When you first install Premiere (described on page 385) the Organizer is installed
at the same time, and it creates a catalog called My Catalog. If you do nothing,
that’s the catalog where Premiere stores all your media.
Figure 4-30:
In Premiere, you can filter your clips
by keyword tag. Click the Select Tag
menu, and it displays a screen like
this. Then it’s just a matter of selecting
the tags you want to apply.

Manage Your
Catalogs
But if you want to create a new catalog, say one called My Business Catalog, follow
these steps:
1. In the Organizer, choose File ➝ Catalog (Ctrl+Shift+C).
The Catalog Manager panel opens, listing your existing catalogs in the box at
the bottom. If you only have one catalog, it’s probably the original one named
My Catalog.
2. In the upper-right corner, click New.
A text box appears where you name the new catalog. If you want the catalog to
include the free music clips that come with Premiere, check the box labeled
“Import free music into this catalog”.
If you have Premiere open, a message box explains that you must close Premiere
before you create a new catalog.
3. Type “My Business Catalog” in the text box and leave the checkbox turned on.
Then click OK.
The Organizer creates and opens your new catalog. You can only work in one
catalog at a time, so Premiere closes My Catalog. That means you’re looking at a
catalog with no content or maybe just some free music. Its keywords and
albums are the barebones ones that Premiere creates when you first start out.
It’s up to you to fill My Business Catalog with new clips, tags, and albums.
Remove a Catalog
When you no longer need a catalog, remove it from the Organizer. Go to File ➝
Catalog to open the catalog manager. Select the catalog you want to remove and
then click the Remove button.
Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:
• You can’t remove a catalog if it’s currently open, which also means you can’t
remove the last catalog in the Organizer.
• You always have to have at least one catalog.
• Removing a catalog doesn’t delete the clips; it just removes the catalog container.
Repair Your Catalog
A catalog is really just a collection of information that keeps track of where your
media clips are. Catalogs track lots of complicated connections, and they have the
unfortunate habit of getting fouled up. If that happens, use the catalog repair com-
mand to see if the Organizer can make things better. Go to File ➝Catalog to open
the catalog manager. Select your catalog from the list at the bottom. Then, on the
right, click the Repair button. A box with a progress bar appears and displays a
message “Repairing Catalog.” When the process is complete, you may see another
box that either says no errors were found or that repairs were made.

136

Optimize Your Catalog
If the Organizer seems to be running sluggishly, run the Optimize tool to see if it
helps. The steps are similar to the Repair process described above. Go to File ➝
Catalog to open the Catalog Manager. Select your catalog from the list at the bottom.
Then, on the right, click the Optimize button. A box with a progress bar appears
while the Organizer tries to do a better job of organizing. When the Organizer fin-
ishes, it returns you to the catalog manager.
Back Up Your Entire Catalog
In general, you don’t have to worry about catalogs too much, especially if you plan
to have a single catalog. There is one important chore that catalogs can help with,
however: backing up your files. It’s probably everyone’s least favorite chore, and
video files are big. So if you’re going to back up, make it easy on yourself and buy
an external hard drive. They’re inexpensive and provide tons of storage.
Plan on spending under $100 for a 500 gigabyte or 1 terabyte external drive. Get a
drive that connects to your computer via a USB cable. Almost all computers have
USB ports, so if disaster strikes, you can easily move all your clips to a new PC.
Then follow these steps to back up everything in your catalog to the hard drive:
1. Connect your external hard drive to your computer through the USB cable.
The first time you connect the drive, Windows may have to install a small
helper program, called a driver. Usually, you hear a tone when your computer
recognizes the hard drive.
2. In the Organizer, choose File ➝ Backup Catalog to CD, DVD, or Hard Drive.
As you can see from the steps above, you can back up your catalog to CDs,
DVDs, or a hard drive. So why is a hard drive recommended? Three reasons:
• If you back up to CDs or DVDs, you have to sit there and feed discs into
your computer.
• Optical drives (CD and DVD) work much more slowly than hard drives.
• You’ll spend more money backing up your catalog on discs as opposed to
doing so on a hard drive.
That said, go ahead and use discs in a pinch. They’re better than no backups at all.
3. Choose Full Backup and click Next.
If this is your first backup, choose Full Backup to back up all the clips in your
catalog. Choose Incremental Backup if you want to back up only clips that have
changed since the last backup.
When you click Next, you see the second panel in the backup window.

Chapter 4: Organize Your Clips

4. In the Select Destination Drive box, choose where you want to store the backups.
The list shows all the drives connected to your computer—CD, DVD, or exter-
nal hard drive. It even lists any network drives available to you. If you want to
select a specific folder within a drive, click the Browse button to locate the
folder.
5. Click Done.
The Organizer displays a progress bar while it backs up the files. If there isn’t
enough room on the destination drive, you see an alert box that says “Your sys-
tem is low on disk space and Elements cannot perform this operation. Try
removing some files to free up disk space.”

Edit Your Movie
Now that you’ve imported, organized, and tagged your clips, it’s time to roll up
your sleeves and make something out of the bits and pieces of your project. Video
editing is similar to other creative activities, like painting or playwriting. Every edi-
tor has his own technique. Along the way, you learn a craftsman’s tricks of the
trade, and, more important, you learn what techniques work for you. At this point,
the basic steps include reviewing and selecting clips, trimming them down to just
the right frames, and arranging them to tell a story.
In this chapter, you’ll start to develop your editing style. For some projects, you
may lean more toward an automated, quick-and-easy approach. You’ll be inter-
ested in Premiere’s InstantMovie and Smart Trim features and how you can take
advantage of the information Premiere stores in smart tags. For other projects, you
may choose a more meticulous, handcrafted approach, where you edit each audio
and sound clip with a keen eye.
In either case, you need to know editing tools like the sceneline, timeline, the Mon-
itor window, the Project View, and the Preview window.
Choose Your Editing Style
Premiere is a versatile tool. You can use its automated editing features, letting Pre-
miere make a lot of decisions for you, or you can assemble your movie and fine-
tune each clip and transition just as a Hollywood film editor would. The approach
you choose depends on the project, your sensibilities, your patience, and the
amount of time you can spend on a given project. When you want to piece

142
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Choose Your Editing
Style
together a quick video of yesterday’s birthday party, you may choose the auto-
mated approach. If you’re producing a documentary of your bike club’s annual
race, you might go for the handcrafted approach.
The next two sections describe the tools and techniques for these different
approaches, but they’re not entirely an “either/or” proposition. You may find
yourself mixing and matching approaches depending on the project, so you’ll learn
both styles. For example, you can use some of the quick-and-easy tools, like Smart
Trim, to help you in a handcrafted project. The short lists below identify the tools
and techniques available for each method.
The Automated Quick-and-Easy Approach
Premiere Elements 8 has more “smart” features than any of its predecessors.
You’ve already heard about InstantMovie and the Auto-Analyzer. Actually, the
Auto-Analyzer does quite a bit of work behind the scenes as it studies your video
and audio clips, and it uses the results of that analysis in some of Premiere’s other
“smart” features to make decisions. Here are some of the things that those smart
features can handle for you:
• Split video clips into scenes. See page 124.
• Identify high-, medium-, and low-quality scenes. See page 120.
• Identify image problems and apply fixes. See page 121.
• Trim clips for content and quality. See page 121.
• Adjust soundtrack (music) and live audio volume. See page 310.
• Find and track moving objects within a video.
• Identify clips that have faces in them. See page 122.
• Automatically assemble clips into a movie, complete with transitions and special
effects. See page 28.
The quick-and-easy upside: Every decision Premiere makes saves you time. The
downside: You and Premiere may, as they say in the film industry, have creative
differences.
The Handcrafted Approach
When you edit video using the “handcrafted” approach, you analyze your video
and other media and make all the decisions about the clips, including the order in
which you want them to play back, how to trim them, and which transitions and
special effects best suit your project. You also choose the soundtrack, music, sound
effects, and live audio.
For serious projects, you should know your footage backward and forward to
make the best editing decisions. In fact, by the time you burn your project to DVD,
you may be tired of watching it.

Chapter 5: Edit Your Movie
143
Gather Clips,
Pictures, and
Animation
The steps for handcrafting a video look like this, though the order can vary a bit:
• Review and trim clips. See Rough Trim Clips (page 152) and Final Trim Clips
(page 166).
• Assemble clips in sequence. See “Assemble Your Movie in the Sceneline” (page
160) or “Assemble Your Movie in the Timeline” (page 162).
• Add transitions. See page 175.
• Add special effects. See page 195.
• Add a soundtrack. See page 291.
• Mix the audio. See page 309.
• Encode the video. See page 315.
• Publish your movie to DVD, website, or computer file. For DVD publishing,
see page 337. For web publishing, see page 323. For exporting your movie to
computer files, see page 380.
The handcrafted upside: Your video has the look and feel you want. The downside:
You spend a lot more time sitting at your computer using Premiere’s manual tools.
Gather Clips, Pictures, and Animation
Earlier chapters explained how to start a project, import clips, and organize your
media in a general way. This section explains how to gather and review your media
while working on a specific project. This is where those earlier organizational
chores, like tagging clips and creating albums, pays off. When you assemble your
video, you’ll be able to quickly put your hand on that great shot of the SUVs mak-
ing their way through Death Valley. You can spend more time assembling your
movie and less time hunting down clips.
The tools you use to control which clips appear in the Media View are near the top
of the panel shown in Figure 5-1. You use the “Filter by” menus, the star ratings,
and the media buttons. Try to follow this order because the filters have a cumula-
tive effect:
• Next to “Filter by”, use the Select Album menu to choose a project or album.
• Use the Select Tag menu to select the tags for the clips you want to see.
• Use the Star Rating option and its adjacent menu to limit the clips displayed.
• Use the Media buttons to show and hide video clips, audio clips, and still
images.
• Use the Set Date Range button to limit the displayed clips to a specific time
period.
• Use the Sort menu to determine the order the clips are displayed.

144
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Gather Clips,

Choose Clips by Project
When you start Premiere, you must choose to work on an existing project or cre-
ate a new one. Either way, as you import or add media using the Get Media tool,
Premiere considers those clips part of that project. The same holds true for any
clips you add to the timeline or sceneline in a project.
To see your project’s clips in the Media View, use Premiere’s “Filter by” menu.
There, the Select Album menu (Figure 5-2) lists albums at the top and projects at
the bottom. So if your project’s name is “Death Valley Days,” you see Death Valley
Days.prel toward the bottom of the Select Album menu. (Adobe uses the filename
extension .prel to denote Premiere Elements project files.) When you select a
project or album in the list, you see a pair of binoculars next to the project or
album name. Choosing a project from the menu is a handy way to exclude the
clips in your catalog that aren’t part of your project. If you don’t have either a
project or an album selected, Premiere displays all the media clips in your catalog.
Choose Clips by Album
As explained on page 126, you use albums to collect lots of clips into a single
group. You create albums in Elements Organizer and select them using filters in
Premiere. You can include an individual clip in more than one album. You can
also create album categories to collect albums into groups, and you can nest one
album category inside of another. In fact, it’s possible to import clips into the
Organizer and place them in albums without ever bringing them into a Premiere
project. You display the contents of an album using the “Filter by” menu shown in
Figure 5-2.
You can only choose one album or one project at a time. If you choose neither,
Premiere displays all the clips in your catalog.
Figure 5-1:
Premiere offers all the tools you need
to select clips at the top of the Media
View on the Organize tab. If you
apply them in order from top to
bottom, left to right, you gradually
winnow down to the few the specific
clips you need for a project.

Deselect a Project or Album Filter
Since you can apply only one project or album filter at a time, selecting a new fil-
ter automatically deselects the previous one. But what if you don’t want any
project or album filter? Click the Show All button to remove all filters, including
the tag, album, star, and media filters. Choose that option if you want to see abso-
lutely everything in your catalog. However, if you only want to remove a project or
album filter, just click the selected filter, which is indicated by the binoculars icon.
The icon disappears and the filter is toggled off.
Choose Clips by Tags
You can cumulatively limit the clips the Organizer displays by selecting tags within
a project, as shown in Figure 5-3. Next to the “Filter by” label, click Select Tag and
choose the tags you want from the drop-down menu. So for example, if you’re
working on the Death Valley Days project, and you select the “Steve” tag, you only
see clips of Steve at Death Valley. You can select several tags at once, so you could
choose both the Steve tag and the Karen tag to display clips tagged with both
“Steve” and “Karen”. You can select both keyword tags and smart tags (which
appear at the bottom of the Select Tag menu). That way, you can find all the “High
Quality” clips with Steve and Karen in them.
Note: In the Elements Organizer application, you can select tags in a way that either includes or excludes
clips. In Premiere’s Organize tab, you can only include clips.
Figure 5-2:
Click the Select Album menu, and you see media albums listed at
the top and projects (shown here) listed at the bottom. Project
names include the .prel extension.

Choose Clips by Star Rating
As you learned earlier (see page 110), Premiere’s star ratings let you rank clips
using a five-star system. You can use any criteria you want for the ratings, but most
filmmakers and photographers use the star rating as a general gauge of a clip’s
quality. To filter your clips using the star rating, click on a star in the Organizer or
the Media panel of Premiere’s Organize tab. Then, next to the rating, use the menu
shown in Figure 5-4 to choose one of the three options: “and higher”, “and lower”,
or “only”. When you set a star rating filter, Premiere never displays clips that have
no star rating.
Tip: You can add or change a star rating as you work with clips in Media View. Make sure you check the
Details box so you can see the star ratings, then simply click the appropriate star under a clip to set the rating.
Filter Clips by Media Type
Under the star rating buttons, you show and hide different types of media using
three toggle buttons: Video, Audio, and Still Image. Once you select a button, it
has a thin frame around it. Use the fourth button of the group to set a date range
for the displayed clips (Figure 5-5).
Sort Clips by Date
Use the Sort menu on the right side of the Organize tab (Figure 5-1) to show clips
in chronological or reverse chronological order, the only two options available.
Newest First is handy when you just imported or added clips to your project. Old-
est First is helpful when you want to arrange clips in the order you shot them.
Figure 5-3:
In Media View, click to select one or

Sometimes, a thumbnail doesn’t provide enough detail about your clips. To learn
more, click the Details checkbox (Figure 5-1) to see the clip’s file name, star rat-

a smart-tagged clip. The other colored tags match the colors assigned to keyword
tags. If you hold your cursor over a clip, you see the filename and folder path for it.
If you want more details on the clip, use the Available Media panel described in the
next section.
Show the Project View
You see thumbnails of your video clips in three places: in the Organizer and under
the Premiere Organize tab’s Media View and Project View (see Figure 5-6). As
explained on page 100, the Organizer is a standalone program that Premiere Ele-
ments and Photoshop Elements share. You first learned about Premiere’s Media
View in Chapter 1 (page 15). The Project View deserves a little more of an intro-
duction. One major difference between the two is that Media View lets you view all
the media in your catalog, while Project View shows you only clips that are part of
your open project. In other words, Project View shows you the clips you added to
your project using the Get Media command while you had the project open. If you
drag clips from the Media View onto a project’s sceneline or timeline, Premiere
also adds them to your project and the Project View.
If you’re a fan of the “handcrafted” video-editing approach, you want to learn all
about Project View. It offers several features you don’t find in either the Organizer
or Media View. Project View is customizable, so you can display details like how
many times you used a clip, the timing of the In and Out points, and the duration
of the clip. Want to add custom comments, like a client’s name, a scene name, or a
log note? The Project View gives you the tools.

Open Project View by clicking the Project button or choosing Window ➝Available
Media (if you plan to use the latter option often, you may want to memorize the key-
board shortcut: Alt+W, A). Double-click a clip in the Project View, and it opens in
the Preview window, where you trim a clip before placing it in the timeline.
Tip: You can use keyboard shortcuts for nearly every Premiere menu command, even the ones that
don’t list a shortcut next to the menu option. Press the Alt key and you see underlined letters in the menu
names. For example, press Alt and you see the W in Window become underlined, so you can press Alt+W
to open the Window menu. Then, when Premiere opens the Window menu, each menu option within it
has an underlined letter. At this point, you can press A to open the Available Media panel, Z to see the
Organize tab, or R to see the Properties window.
The by-now-familiar “Filter by” buttons at the top of Project View let you choose
whether you want to display video clips, audio clips, still pictures, or some combi-
nation of the three.
Project View gives you the choice of two modes, List View or Icon View. You toggle
between them using the buttons in the lower-left corner of the Project panel or by
using Ctrl+PgUp for List View and Ctrl+PgDn for Icon View. Of the two modes,
List is the most helpful because it offers more details about your clips, including
media type (audio, video, or still image), frame rate, duration, and the number of
times you used a media file in the current project. Icon mode is similar to the
Organize tab view, listing just the file name and clip duration.
You use the other buttons in that lower-corner neighborhood to create folders (to
organize clips within the Project View), navigate folders, and delete clips
(Figure 5-7).
View Clip Properties in Project View
The handiest and most interesting thing about the Project View is the way it dis-
plays clip details in table format. Each column in the table presents details about
your clip. Here are some examples, not necessarily in the order you first see them:
• Thumbnail. This is the same thumbnail image you see in the Organize tab.
• Name. Initially, this is the filename for the clip, but you can change the name
here by clicking on it and typing in a new, more useful name.
Figure 5-7:
The Project View has media filter buttons, but it doesn’t
have album or tag filters because it shows only those clips
that are part of your current, open project.

• Used. Checkmarks mean the clip is currently in your project’s timeline.
• Media Type. Lets you know whether the item is a movie, audio, a still or a
folder.
• Frame Rate. Lists the frame rate in the standard measure, frames per second.
• Media Duration. Shows the clip’s duration as hrs;mins;seconds;frames.
• Video Usage. Displays the number of times you used the video clip in the
project.
• Audio Usage. Displays the number of times you used the audio clip in a project.
• Comment. Here you can add any notes or comments that describe the clip or
help you in your work. You can save lots of clip-reviewing time by adding
descriptive comments to your clips. For example, a note that says “Great foot-
age of Jeeps in desert, marred by sun flare at 02;18;26” may help you decide
whether or not to use a clip without taking the time to review it again.
As helpful as some of these details are, there’re even better ones hidden away. For
example, if you shot all your video with a single camera, you may not be too con-
cerned about frame rate since all the clips will have the same frame rate. On the
other hand, it might be very helpful to see the In and Out points for your clips.
Customize the Project View
Initially, Project View displays your clips and their properties in a table arrange-
ment as shown in Figure 5-8. You’re not limited to this arrangement, though.
Click a column heading to sort the clips according to that property. So, by clicking
on the Video Usage heading, you can make the clips you use the most jump to the
top of the table. A second click reverses the sort order, putting unused and seldom-
used clips at the top. You can rearrange the order of the columns themselves by
clicking their headings and dragging them to a new location.
Figure 5-8:
You can customize the Project View in a
couple of ways. You can choose which
properties Premiere displays and you
can click and drag the headings to
reorder the properties. Here, the Frame

prominent location.

The clip properties that Premiere initially displays are only a fraction of those
available. To see the whole list and pick and choose among them, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Window ➝ Show Docking Headers.
An extra header appears above each of the panels. (When you first install and
run Premiere, Adobe keeps the workspace simplified and doesn’t display the
docking headers. They give you additional ways to customize your workspace.)
2. Choose the Project View button, if you aren’t already in Project View.
The docking header for Project View says Tasks on the right side. On the left
side, there are two triangle icons that open the Available Media panel menu
(Figure 5-9).
3. Click the panel menu button and then choose Edit Columns.
The Edit Columns panel (Figure 5-10) shows all the properties that Premiere can
display in the Available Media panel. Use the scroll bar to see the complete list.
4. Click to turn on the boxes next to the properties you want to appear in the Avail-
able Media panel. You can also deselect properties you don’t want displayed.
Using the buttons on the right side of the Edit Columns window, shown in
Figure 5-10, you can rename properties or add new ones. You can change the
order of the properties using the Move Up and Move Down buttons, but it’s
easier to make those changes as described in the following steps.
5. Click OK.
The Edit Columns panel closes and you see just the Project View columns you
want.

6. (Optional) Click and drag column headers to rearrange the columns’ order.
For example, if you want Media Duration right next to the clips’ name, drag the
header over. You can customize the columns however you want. And if you
want to give a column more room, resize it by moving your cursor to the line
between column headers and, when the cursor changes to a vertical line with
two arrows, drag to a new column width.
Once you have the Project View set up the way you want, you’ll see more detail on
your clips, including your own comments.
From Project View, you can review and trim your clips using the Preview panel
that pops up when you double-click a clip. Then you can drop these rough-edited
clips into your timeline. Many editors jump back and forth between Project View
and Media View as they work.
Review and Rough-Trim Your Clips
You have to review a clip to decide whether or not it’s worthy of your project. In
fact, for most handcrafted projects, you’ll view your clips over and over as you rate,
tag, arrange, and trim them. Fortunately, it’s not hard to work with clips. No mat-
ter which tools you use to organize and assemble your movie, it’s easy to review
and trim your clips as you work. When you work in Project View, you use the Pre-
view window. When you work in Media View, you use the tools in the sceneline
and timeline.
Review Clips in the Preview Window
If you’re in Project View, double-click a clip and the Preview window opens as
shown in Figure 5-11. In the Preview window, you can use the standard DVD-like
controls to move through your clip. It’s also a great place to “rough-trim” your
video. A rough trim usually cuts off both ends of a clip, selecting the good bits that

you’re most likely to use. Don’t worry about fine-tuning the trim, because you
may not be able to make those decisions until you see the clip next to the adjacent
clips in the timeline.

How Premiere Protects Your Original Clips
When you edit a movie in Premiere, you’re never working
on the raw files you import. If you were and you made a
mistake, that raw footage would be lost to the ages—you’ll
never be able to recreate that charming shot of Junior’s first
encounter with a dog.
To safeguard against such a calamity, Premiere imports
your originals and stores them away (in a location you
select). It then creates copies of those originals so that
when you work in Premiere, you’re working on those cop-
ies (which Premiere and this book call “previews”, not to be
confused with the act of previewing an in-progress movie).
Once you finish editing your movie and you’re ready to
share it with the world, Premiere goes back to those original
files, using the “map” you created with the preview clips,
and assembles your finished movie using the original files
as the source material—that way, you create a finished film
using the highest quality video and audio files possible.
Incidentally, the act of assembling and saving a finished
video file is also called “exporting” a video.

Review and Rough-
Trim Your Clips
Here’s how you review and rough-trim a clip in the Preview window:
1. Double-click on a clip in Project View.
The Preview window opens with the clip loaded.
2. Click the Play button (or press the space bar) to watch the clip.
As you view the clip, identify the portion you want to use. As good a cinematog-
rapher as you are, it’s unlikely you’ll use an entire clip very often. More likely,
you’ll want just a portion of it. To isolate that portion, you need to tell Pre-
miere where you want the clip to begin (called the clip’s In point) and where
you want it to end (called the Out point).
Use the video control buttons in the Preview window to move through your
clip (or use shortcut keys described in the box on page 155). Go through it as
many times as you need.
3. Identify the clip’s In point.
As you review the clip on a second or third pass, you probably know about
where you want to put its In point. You can get to that point a couple of ways:
• As you review the clip on subsequent passes, press the Pause button to stop
playback near the In point.
• Position the playhead (which Premiere calls the Current Time Indicator or
CTI) where you want the In mark. You can drag the playhead to any posi-
tion on the clip.
4. Fine-tune the In point.
Use the transport tools, including the single-frame-forward button (Step For-
ward) and the single-frame-back button (Step Back), to locate just the right frame.
When you click the Set In button, the clip’s unselected segment (the portion
from the beginning of the clip to your newly set In point) turns gray. The
selected segment gets highlighted in purple.
5. Identify the clip’s Out point.
Pause playback or position the playhead where you want the Out mark, fine-
tune it with the frame-by-frame buttons, and then click the Set Out button.
At this point, you’ve trimmed off the two ends of the clip and selected the seg-
ment you want to use, highlighted in purple.
6. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the Preview window.
The Preview window closes, but Premiere remembers how you trimmed the
clip. Later, when you add the clip to the timeline, Premiere automatically uses
only the portion within the In and Out marks. Don’t worry, though, you can
still use the trimmed portions of a clip if you change your mind later; remember,

Chapter 5: Edit Your Movie
155
Review and Rough-
Trim Your Clips
Premiere leaves the original clip intact, so if you double-click the clip to bring it
into the Preview window, you can reset the In and Out points (or select entirely
new points to select a different portion of the clip).
It seems you never stop reviewing clips while you’re editing. You can review clips
and set In and Out marks while you assemble clips in the sceneline or timeline, as
described in the next sections. As you work in the Preview window and the time-
line, you can speed things up by using the shortcut keys (page 155).
Review Clips in the Sceneline
Click the Sceneline button, and you see a series of large and small boxes along the
bottom of the Premiere window. Drag a clip from the Project or Media window
into one of the big boxes, and Premiere adds it to your movie. (The small boxes
hold transitions, like dissolves or fades, which you’ll learn about on page 175.)
The sceneline is a great tool when you’re ready to sequence your video clips. That’s
because it’s actually a storyboard. As you pop your trimmed clips into the boxes,
the clips’ thumbnails appear there, giving you a sense of what your finished movie
will look like.
The sceneline handles some of the same chores as the timeline, but its simplified
tools make things like arranging clips a little easier. (For more about the differ-
ences between the sceneline and the timeline, see the box on page 159.) The scene-
line doesn’t display the audio that’s synched with a video clip, but there are two
tracks at the bottom of it for music and sound effects or narration.
Once you add clips to the sceneline, you can review them in Premiere’s monitor.
Click a clip, and the monitor displays the scene’s first frame, along with a mini-
timeline at the bottom of the monitor, complete with In and Out markers as
shown in Figure 5-12. To trim a clip here, drag either the In or Out marker. You
can change the scale of the mini-timeline to zoom in to see fewer frames or zoom
out to see more. Just above the time scale, you see a thin, horizontal bar with
arrows on each end; drag an arrow to adjust the scale of the mini-timeline.

Shortcut Keys for Viewing Video
When your hand is on the mouse, it’s easy to click the Play
and Rewind buttons in the preview and monitor windows.
But if your hands are on the keyboard, it’s faster to use short-
cut keys. The shortcut keys are also great for jumping to spe-
cific points in your movie. Here’s a list of handy shortcuts:
Space bar: Play/Pause

Review and Rough-
Trim Your Clips
It can be a little hard to tell where one clip ends and another begins in the time-
line; click anywhere on a clip, and Premiere highlights it in purple, making the
boundaries of the clip clear. Unlike the sceneline, when you select a clip in the
timeline, it doesn’t automatically show up in the monitor. In the timeline, the
image the monitor displays is governed entirely by the position of the playhead, as
shown in Figure 5-14.
Follow these steps to review and trim video clips while you work in the timeline:
1. Create and name a new project using the File ➝ New ➝ Project command.
Premiere creates a new project with an empty timeline. The Tasks panel displays
the Organize tab and the contents of your media catalog.
2. Below the monitor on the left, click the timeline button.
If the timeline’s already displayed, you can skip this step. In any case, you see
the timeline view across the bottom of the screen. A time scale appears at the
top, with labels for the different tracks, such as Video 1 and Audio 1, displayed
on the left side.

3. Drag a video clip from the catalog to the beginning of Video 1 track.
Place the left edge of the clip all the way to the left end of the track, where the
scale reads 00;00;00;00. Sometimes, you need to use the Project window’s hori-
zontal and vertical scrollbar to find your spot in the timeline. Use the scrollbar
on the right to see the different tracks. For example, above Video 1 you can find
the tracks Video 2 and Audio 2.
4. On your keyboard, press V.
The keyboard shortcut V changes your cursor to Premiere’s Selection tool,
which you use to select and trim clips. If you’ve got your hand full of mouse,
you can also click the arrow icon above the timeline (see Figure 5-15).
5. Move your mouse to the right end of the clip on the timeline.
When you have the cursor over the edge of the clip, it changes from an arrow to
a trim cursor—a bracket with two arrows. The open end of the bracket always
faces the clip you’re trimming. This is helpful to know when you put the cursor
over a splice where two clips meet—the open bracket always tells you which of
the clips you’re trimming.
6. Drag the trim cursor to the right to trim the clip, then release the mouse.
As you drag to the right, you make the clip longer by adding frames. You can
keep adding frames, as long as they’re available in the original clip (at some
point, you come to the end of your raw footage). As you adjust the trim, Pre-
miere displays a tooltip showing how much time you’re adding or removing
from a clip.
Remember, Premiere never alters your original clips (it creates a copy of it for
editing purposes, which it calls a “preview” version), so any frames that were
there at the beginning are always available when you edit. Why would you want
to extend a clip beyond your initial edit points? You may discover you need a
little more footage to accommodate a transition or special effect.
7. Now, click the edge of the lengthened the clip and drag it to the left.
Dragging the edge to the left removes the frames you just added. You can keep
tweaking the In and Out points for clips up until you’re ready to export your
final film.
8. Click the left edge of the clip and drag it to the right.
In this step, you’re removing frames from the beginning of the clip. It’s the
same as setting a new In point for the clip. Notice how the front edge of a clip
automatically snaps to the first frame position in the timeline.
As you’ll learn later, you assemble a movie by dragging additional clips to the time-
line, placing them snug against each other, and fine-tuning their edit points as
described above.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Sceneline vs. Timeline
Should I use the sceneline or the timeline?
The sceneline and the timeline give you two different views
of the same territory—your movie (Figure 5-13). There’s
nothing wrong with choosing the tool that works best for
you. In general, the sceneline meshes with the quick-and-
easy approach to editing, while the timeline lends itself to
the handcrafted approach.
The sceneline works like a storyboard. For ages, film-
maker’s have used storyboards to plot out their movies.
Individual frames (usually hand-drawn) represent a seg-
ment of a scene. Piece together a few of these segments,
and you have a quick way to communicate the way a story
sequence unfolds. You can use the sceneline this way.
A single video frame represents each clip and visually tells
part of the story. By glancing at the sceneline boxes, you
can understand how one action leads to the next. The
major disadvantage of the sceneline is that you can’t tell at
a glance how long a clip is—they all look the same.
The timeline gives you a more traditional, video-editor’s
view of your project. The time scale at the top gives you a
reference for your entire movie and for each clip. It’s easy
to look at any clip and determine its length and relationship
to the rest of your movie. Every bit of media in your project
appears in a track, and you can even see visual representa-
tions of transitions and volume changes in your audio
tracks. When you dig deep, the timeline offers a slew of
tools for tweaking your movie.
If you’re an old hand at video editing, you may be inclined
to use only the timeline. There’s nothing wrong with that. If
you’re a fan of the quick-and-easy approach to editing, you
may want to stick with the sceneline.
If you’re like most Premiere Elements editors, you’ll proba-
bly jump back and forth, depending on the chore you’re
tackling at the moment. For example, the sceneline is great
for your first crack at assembling clips in a sequence, while
the timeline is the tool for fine-tuning transitions, audio,
and complex visual effects. So, don’t hesitate to explore
both tools before you get set in your video editing ways.

Assemble Your
Movie
Assemble Your Movie
You can put your movie together using either the sceneline or the timeline.
Whether you use the sceneline’s boxes or the timeline’s tracks, the act of putting
one clip after another is easy; choosing the best sequence is a little more challenging,
and that’s where the art of movie editing comes in. That means you won’t neces-
sarily get it right the first time. So you’ll spend some time editing In and Out
points, rearranging clips, and swapping one for another as you work.
Assemble Your Movie in the Sceneline
In the sceneline, you build your movie by dragging clips and scenes into the boxes
(Figure 5-16). To see the current state of your movie, press the Home button to
automatically go to the beginning of your movie, and then press the space bar or
click the monitor’s Play button. You change the order of clips simply by dragging
them to different boxes. When you drag a clip to a box that already holds a clip,
Premiere pushes the existing clip (and all its neighbors) toward the beginning or the
end of the sceneline and replaces the resident clip with the one you drop in. As you
do so, Premiere displays a blue vertical line showing you where in the sceneline the
new clip will end up.
Here’s a short list of what you can do in the sceneline:
• Add your first clip to the sceneline. Drag a clip to the first box, and you’ve
started assembling your movie. You can get the clip from Premiere’s Media or
Project View. The box displays the first frame of the clip. If the clip was smart-
tagged and divided into scenes (as described on page 124), each scene occupies
its own box in the sceneline.
• Add a clip to the end of the movie. To add the next scene in your movie, drag
another clip to the next empty box. When you play back your movie-in-
progress, they play in sequence without time gaps between clips.
• Add a scene from a clip. If you want to add a single scene from a clip that Auto-
Analyzer divvied up into multiple scenes, in Media View, click the button on
the right edge of the stacked clips to display each scene. Drag the scene you
want to a box in the sceneline.
• Review clips or scenes in the sceneline. Click on the clip in the sceneline and
press the space bar. Your clip plays in the monitor and if you let it, it continues
to play the rest of the clips to the end of the movie. You can use any of the mon-
itor tools to move around and review the scenes you’re assembling, including
the shortcut keys described on page 155.
• Remove a clip or scene from the sceneline. Select the scene you want to remove
and press the Delete key, or right-click the scene and click “Delete just scene”
from the drop-down menu. Premiere removes the clip and any overlays it has,
such as titles or superimposed pictures (more on those fancy features on pages
267 and 261). The other clips move to close the gap left by the deleted scene.
(Remember, you’re not really deleting the clip from your project, it’s still sit-
ting in your catalog in the Project Panel.)

Chapter 5: Edit Your Movie
161
Assemble Your
Movie
• Reposition a clip in the sceneline. Select the clip in the sceneline and drag it in
front of another scene. The scene and its overlays move to the new spot. If you
Shift-drag, a menu asks if you want to “Move Scene and its objects” or “Move
just scene”.
• Insert a clip in the middle of a movie. To place a clip in front of another clip
that’s already in the sceneline, drag the new clip on top of the clip in the scene-
line. Again, the blue vertical bar shows you the clip’s destination.
• Insert a clip in the middle of another clip or scene. In the monitor, position the
playhead where you want to divide a clip that’s in the sceneline. Shift-drag the
new clip you want to insert onto the monitor (not the sceneline or timeline).
There are several special effects you can create by Shift-dragging one clip onto
another in the monitor, so a pop-up menu asks which you want. Choose “Split
and Insert”.
Tip: Don’t forget the ever-faithful Undo key (Ctrl+Z). It’s often the quickest way to fix a mistake or back-
track as you edit and assemble a movie. It works in both the sceneline and the timeline. If you undo too
much, use Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z) to, ahem, undo your Undo.

Assemble Your

Timeline
Assemble Your Movie in the Timeline
Assembling your movie in the timeline is similar to doing so in the sceneline, but the
view’s entirely different. Drag a clip from the Media or Project panel onto the time-
line, and video and audio tracks pop into place instead of a thumbnail. The scale at
the top of the timeline displays the movie’s timecode (in hours;minutes;seconds;frames
format). Hold your cursor over a clip, and a tooltip shows you the exact moment it
begins and ends.
Just above the scale, you find the set of buttons shown in Figure 5-17; they help
you select clips and zoom in and out on the timeline.
In the timeline, you can “link” clips, meaning you can lock the video and audio
tracks together so they act as one. When you move linked tracks around the time-
line they stay together unless you use an explicit command that unlinks them.
Other times, you may add video- and audio-only tracks to the timeline.
• Add your first clip to the timeline. Drag a clip from Media or Project View to
the 00;00;00;00 position in the timeline. When you first create a project, Pre-
miere gives it several video tracks. You main movie is built on the tracks Video
1 and Audio 1. You use the tracks above that, Video 2 and Audio 2, for special
effects and overlays like picture-in-picture (see page 261 for a full description).
• Add a clip to the end of the movie. Drag another clip to the timeline and put it
right after the first clip. As your cursor gets close to the end of the first clip, the
second clip automatically snaps to the end of the first, making a snug fit. When
you first install Premiere, it enables a feature called Snap (Timeline ➝Snap).
This makes it easy to butt one clip against another without a high degree of
mouse marksmanship. Press S to toggle Snap on and off. With Snap off, it’s easy
to place a clip in the middle of another clip, splitting it into two parts in the
process, as described below.
• Add a scene from a clip. Premiere’s Auto-Analyzer divides some clips into indi-
vidual scenes, as explained on page 124. In the Organize tab, clips holding multi-
ple scenes appear with a thick, light-gray border, an icon in the upper-right
corner, and a Group Open button on the right edge of the frame. Click the
Group Open button to expand the clip into its multiple scenes, and then drag
the scene you want to the timeline.

another clip. The clip automatically splits into two, with your new clip in the mid-
dle. To position a clip with precision, you may have to zoom in on the timeline as
described in Figure 5-17. As an alternative, you can move the playhead to the
point where you want to split a clip, and then Shift-drag the new clip onto the
monitor. When the pop-up menu appears, choose “Split and Insert”.
• Remove frames from the middle of a clip or scene. Drag the playhead to the
first frame of a clip you want to split. Under the monitor, click the Split Clip
button (which looks like a pair of scissors) or press Ctrl+K. The clip splits into
two segments. Then, with the Select tool (V), trim the clip as described on page
158. If a gap results, right-click in the gap and select “Delete and Close Gap”.
• Select just the video or audio part of a clip. Most clips that come from your
camcorder have their video and audio tracks linked together so they play in
sync. Occasionally, you want to break this duo apart. For example, you may
want to add a music track to a video, so you want to keep the video track but
replace the audio track. Right-click on the clip and select “Delete Audio” from
the menu. Alternatively, to move the audio track to another part of your movie,
Alt-click it and drag the audio to its destination. The video track stays put.
• Synchronize linked clips. If you move clips out of sync using the Alt-drag
method described above, you can bring them back into sync with a single com-
mand. Right-click one of the offset numbers shown in Figure 5-19 and choose
“Move Into Sync” from the menu.
Customize the Timeline
When you edit your project using the handcrafted approach, the timeline is where
all the action is. If you’ve got the computer screen real estate, you can enhance
your view of the timeline. To see more timeline tracks, drag the bar between the
timeline and the monitor. To adjust the size of the tracks themselves, right-click on
an empty part of the timeline and choose “Track Size”. Like a theater snack bar,
you have three choices: Small, Medium, and Large. Want to customize even more?
On the left side of the timeline, drag the horizontal track boundaries to change the
size of individual tracks. You can make the video tracks larger, for example, which
gives you easy-to-see thumbnails in the timeline.
Better yet, if you have two monitors (or one really big monitor), you can move the
timeline so that it stands on its own, giving you more room to increase the track
sizes or other panels (Figure 5-20).

Assemble Your
Movie in the
Timeline
To separate the timeline from the rest of Premiere’s panels, choose Window ➝
Show Docking Headers. A new bar appears at the top of the timeline (on the left
side it says “My Project”, and on the right there are two triangle buttons that open
the panel menu). Click the middle of the docking header and drag the timeline to a
new spot. Once you separate it from the Premiere window, you can resize the
timeline by dragging any edge.
Whenever you want to put all Premiere’s parts and panels back the way they were
when you first installed the program, go to Window ➝ Restore Workspace.
On the left side of the timeline, there are little icons next to the words Video,
Audio, Narration, and Soundtrack. These are actually buttons in disguise. Click
them to change the way Premiere shows clips in that track. For example, click a
video track button to change the video thumbnails that identify that clip. You can
have thumbnails the whole length of the clip, a thumbnail on each end or a single
thumbnail at the beginning of a clip. For audio tracks, the button shows and hides
the waveform representation of the sound.

Premiere keeps track of

Final-Trim Clips
Listen to film editors talk, and you’d think they were jazz musicians—you hear
words like tempo, rhythm, and beat. A good editor knows exactly how long to hold a
close-up of someone’s face and when to cut away to a long shot. Inevitably, someone
will ask, “Shouldn’t we stay on that for another beat?” If you’re taking the hand-
crafted approach to your project, you probably want to take another pass through it
after you complete the rough assembly work. If you’re adding a music soundtrack, as
covered in Chapter 10, you may want to hold off on your final trim until that’s in
place. Then you can use the soundtrack’s beat to guide your final trim.
In the final trim, look for ways to make your movie more interesting visually. In
most cases, final trimming makes your movie shorter. You trim the front and back
ends of clips so that you end up with only the needed and best parts. The monitor
automatically shows you two clips at once as you trim the point where they meet,
as shown in Figure 5-21.
In some cases, you want to split a sequence and insert a “cutaway.” For example, if
you have a long scene of two grandfathers talking to each other in a living room,
you might insert a cutaway of the dog sleeping by the fire. The sound of the con-
versation continues, even though the image changes. While the dog might not be
vital to the scene, it contributes to the mood and atmosphere. The cutaway pro-
vides visual interest both when it cuts to the dog and when it cuts back to the
grandfathers. There are plenty of technical reasons to use a cutaway, too. It gives
you a smooth way to trim out bad bits of film. For example, suppose at one point
in the grandfather’s conversation, the shot was ruined by a reflection off of one of
their glasses. You could use a cutaway to remove that segment of video without
disrupting the flow of the conversation. Or you could use the cutaway as a transi-
tion shot, letting you change from a close two-shot to a longer shot. Often, jump-
ing from one view of a subject to another seems jarring. A cutaway can help
smooth the transition.
In your final trim, you use the same review and trim tools described earlier: the
monitor, the In and Out points, and all the video transport tools. It’s important to
watch your video at normal speed when you make final-trim decisions, and you
may want to watch the video in full-screen mode to approximate what it would
look like on a TV. Just click the Full Screen icon in the upper right-hand corner of
Premiere’s menu bar. Premiere has a few additional tools to help when it comes to
the final trim. If you’re looking for a little guidance and some automation, try
Smart Trim and the Auto-Analyzer, both described next.

Final-Trim Clips
Famous Movie Moment: Early filmmakers shot movies like stage plays. They set the camera up at dis-
tance and turned it on. Filmmakers like Edwin S. Porter, D.W. Griffith, and Sergei Eisenstein, among oth-
ers, invented the film language we use today. They learned how to use multiple shots to tell a story and
communicate, whether the action was taking place simultaneously or at some other point in time. Like any
language, the language of the moving picture became more complex and poetic. “Meanwhile, back at the
ranch…”
Get Guidance from Smart Trim
Smart Trim is a new Premiere feature that marks areas of your clip that may not be
up to snuff. Choose Timeline ➝Smart Trim Mode, and the Auto Analyzer begins
examining the clip in the timeline. It marks questionable sections of your video
with the diagonal highlights shown in Figure 5-22. As long as you keep Smart Trim
toggled on, it analyzes and marks clips as you add them to the timeline.
Figure 5-21:
When you trim with
multiple clips in the
timeline, the monitor
displays the Out point for
one clip and the In point
for the next. This helpful
feature gives you a great
way to fine-tune your
transitions.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Final-Trim Clips
Tip: Smart Trim has two modes: Manual and Automatic. In Manual mode, it highlights (with diagonal
lines) parts of your clips that have problems. In Automatic mode, Smart Trim takes the initiative and trims
out those bad bits. Until you get a feeling for Smart Trim’s taste and decision-making process, it’s proba-
bly best to work in Manual mode. If Smart Trim isn’t behaving the way you expect it to, check out the
Smart Trim options: Go to Timeline ➝Smart Trim Options. You may have to click “Mode” to see the Man-
ual and Automatic buttons.
Once Smart Trim highlights your clips, you can play back the trouble spots just as
you would any other portion of your movie (Figure 5-23). As it analyzes, Smart
Trim splits your clips into good and bad shots, so you can work with highlighted
segments just as you do regular scenes in a clip. That makes it easy to remove or
trim the highlighted segment. Use the Selection tool (V) to select a segment
marked by Smart Trim. The selection works like a toggle—click once and the
marked segment is selected; click again, and it’s deselected. This makes it easy to
select different segments along the timeline. Press Delete, and Premiere cuts
selected segments from the clip.

When you use the Smart
Trim feature in the

Final-Trim Clips
To determine your video offense, move your cursor over one of the marked sec-
tions and Smart Trim pops up a tooltip. Right-click on a marked area and a short-
cut menu appears with a few options (Figure 5-24):
• Click Trim to remove the marked and selected segments. Of course, trimming
out a section in your clip creates a cut. Premiere automatically puts a dissolve
transition at the cut. If you want to change that, go to Edit ➝Preferences ➝
General and turn off the checkbox labeled “Apply Dissolve on Smart Trim”.
Keep in mind that Smart Trim edits only affect the clip on the timeline. The
master clip from which it’s taken remains in your media catalog and can be
used in other projects.
• Use Keep when you disagree with Smart Trim. The diagonal stripes disappear,
and the segment is no longer branded.
• The Select All option selects all the segments Smart Trim marked. At this point
you can Trim or Keep them.
• Choose Smart Trim Options to fine-tune the way Smart Trim analyzes your
clips (below it includes two settings, one for what it calls “Quality Level” and
one for “Interest Level”).
• Undo Smart Trim restores sections you deleted.

Adjust Smart Trim options
If you consistently disagree with the way Smart Trim tags your clips, you can fine-
tune its options (Figure 5-25). Right-click on a highlighted clip or go to Timeline ➝
Smart Trim Options to open a panel where you can make changes. Sliders let you
adjust how rigorously Smart Trim evaluates your clips in two (rather obscure) cat-
egories: Quality Level and Interest Level. Quality Level looks at a clip’s brightness,
contrast, and focus; Interest Level considers faces, voice, and motion (presumably
how much of each there is, on the assumption that more is better).
Drag the sliders to the right to emphasize the characteristics measured in the two
levels. Under Mode, you can choose Manual or Automatic Smart Trimming.
Group Clips for Protection
Once you get a sequence of clips just the way you want them in the timeline, you
don’t want to inadvertently mess them up by inserting new clips or moving one to
another spot. You can protect your work by grouping clips together. In either the
sceneline or timeline, select the clips you want to group, then right-click one of
them and choose Group. The clips now behave as if they were a single clip. You
can trim the ends of the group, but not the individual clips without an extra step
or two. To break up the group into individual clips again, right-click the group and
choose Ungroup.
Use Markers to Locate Edit Points
As your movie grows larger and more complex, your timeline gets longer and
longer. At some point, you’re going to find yourself scrolling around looking for a
specific spot in the timeline and wasting time. Premiere lets you add markers to
the timeline so you can pinpoint important spots and provide additional details.
Think of them as electronic sticky notes.
Figure 5-25:
Use the Smart Trim options panel to fine-tune how
Smart Trim works. Under the Advanced tab, you can
use keyword tags to always include or always
exclude tagged clips from the Smart Trim process.

You can choose from a few different types of markers:
• Timeline markers can be numbered or unnumbered, as shown in Figure 5-26.
You can have a total of 100 timeline markers.
• Clip markers are much like timeline markers, except that you view and create
clip markers in the Preview window. You can have 100 markers in any clip, in
addition to Timeline or other markers.
• Beat markers help you edit your video to a music soundtrack. More on that in
the chapter on sound, beginning on page 308.
• Menu markers identify chapters (and other elements) in your video for use
with DVD menus. See the details on page 338.
To add a marker to your timeline, drag the playhead to the point of interest, right-
click anywhere on the time scale, and choose Set Timeline Marker. A submenu
gives you three choices: “Unnumbered”, “Next Available Number”, or “Other
Numbered”. Use the Other Numbered option when you want to create a num-
bered marker that’s out of sequence.
Once you have a marker in the timeline, you can drag it to a new location if need
be. You don’t have to keep numbered markers in sequence in the timeline. For
example, marker 7 could be to the left of marker 6. Double-click a marker in the
timeline to open the Marker panel where you can type in details about that spot in
your movie (Figure 5-27).
Figure 5-26:
You can use either
numbered or
unnumbered timeline
markers, as shown here,

That’s not as limiting as
it might seem because
you can attach up to 100

To delete a marker, use the Go To commands to find the marker, right click the
time scale and then choose “Clear Timeline Marker”. You can also choose the
option “Clear All Timeline Markers”.
Clip markers work like timeline markers, with a few exceptions. Clip markers
don’t support comments, chapter numbers, or web addresses. Those are only
available in timeline markers. And you create Clip markers in the Preview win-
dow. To open the Preview window, double-click a clip in Media View, the Project
panel, or the timeline. Drag the playhead to the point where you want to add a
marker, then right-click on the video image or the mini-timeline and choose Set
Clip Marker. The pop-up menu gives you several options for different types of In
and Out points. At the bottom of the menu, there are options for creating num-
bered and unnumbered markers.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Render Your Movie Automatically or Manually
Why Does Premiere Need to “Render” Video?
As you assemble video clips and, later, add transitions and
special effects, displaying all that razzle-dazzle as it will
appear in the final movie saps your system’s processing
resources. If it’s too much for your computer to handle, play-
back becomes herky-jerky. To resolve the problem, Premiere
creates previews of your movie that do a lot of this intensive
processing up front, before playback. That way, your movie
plays back more smoothly as you edit. The process that does
this is called “rendering.” Premiere uses two rendering
modes: background rendering and manual rendering.
Background rendering, introduced in Premiere Elements 8,
relieves you of the chore of manually rendering, provided
your computer has enough horsepower to do it. With back-
ground rendering, when your PC isn’t busy doing other
tasks, Premiere automatically renders the video in your
timeline. That way, when you want to preview your film, the
rendering is already done.
In computers that have powerful dual- or quad-core proces-
sors, this feature works well. However, if you’re using an
older system and find everything runs too slowly, you may
want to work with background rendering turned off (Pre-
miere automatically turns this feature on during installation).
Go to Preferences ➝General and turn off the checkbox next
to Enable Background Rendering, then click OK.
If you turn off background rendering, you need to manually
render your video to get smooth playback. When you add
a clip to the timeline, you may notice a thin, red horizontal
line above the frames. That means that the clip hasn’t been
rendered. Once a clip is rendered, the line turns green
(Figure 5-28).
You can manually render the video in your timeline by
pressing the Enter key. A dialog box appears with a progress
bar and other details about the rendering process.
Rendering may take some time, depending on the com-
plexity and length of your clip. You can’t do anything in Pre-
miere while it manually renders, so it’s a good time to check
your email or the baseball scores. You can preselect the
area that Premiere should manually render by positioning
the WorkArea bar, the adjustable gray bar just above the
timeline. You can drag the entire bar to move it, and you
can adjust it by dragging the ends to a new position. When
you press the enter key to manually render your video, Pre-
miere renders the portion below the bar.

LOLA’S BIG SPLASH PROJECT
Assemble Your Movie
If you’re following along with the exercises for “Lola’s Big
Splash,” this is a good time to practice your assembly and
trimming skills:
• View clips in the Media View and Project View.
• Use Auto-Analyzer to smart tag your clips.
• Preview and rough trim clips in the Preview window.
• Add clips to the timeline or sceneline.
• Practice trimming clips in both the sceneline and
timeline.
• In the timeline, practice trimming clips at a cut
where two clips meet.
• Turn on Smart Trim to see Auto-Analyzer results and
Smart Trim suggestions.
You can assemble your movie however you want, but each
of the Lola video clips are numbered, like 01-House.MP4,
02-Street.MP4. If you preview, trim, and place the clips in
the sceneline or timeline according to their numbers, your
movie will be similar to the finished video shown at http://
missingmanuals.com/cds/premelements8tmm/. Keep in
mind the duration for the soundtrack and the final movie as
shown is a little under two minutes, so trim your clips
accordingly.

Add Transitions
Filmmakers use transitions in a movie to switch from one scene to another. Transi-
tions between scenes can smooth the narrative flow of a film or add to its emotional
impact. In Premiere terms, adding transitions means you insert an effect where the
end of one clip meets the beginning of another.
You’ve seen these effects—they include everything from a simple dissolve between
scenes to the more elaborate turning page or spinning cube. Some transitions sub-
tly bridge the visual jump from one scene to another, while others end up calling
attention to themselves and taking the viewer’s attention away from the content—
witness the infamous Star Wipe.
Premiere gives you dozens upon dozens of between-scene transitions to work with,
as you can see in Figure 6-1. That’s more than enough to make a really cheesy
movie.
This chapter explains how to use and customize transitions, along with advice on
how to keep a tight reign on them so you don’t overdo it. But if you’re just experi-
menting and having fun, go crazy.
Choose a Stock Transition
Watch most feature films, and you may be surprised at how few transitions they
use and how unobtrusive they are. Transitions are part of the language of film and,
for the most part, they communicate a message about time. For example:
Fade in from black (page 179). Most movies start off by fading in from a black back-
ground. This is the filmmaker’s version of “Once upon a time….” You understand
that things happened to the characters before this moment, but this is where the

176
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Choose a Stock
Transition
filmmaker wants to begin to tell her story. It’s a fine film convention and works well
whether you’re making an indie film or editing a video of your cousin’s wedding.
Fade to black (page 179). The other bookend for most movies is the fade to black
at the end of the story. The transition elegantly implies that the story the film-
maker wants to tell ends here, even though the story and characters continue. Some-
times, filmmakers use the fade-to-black transition to break their movie into
segments, similar to the way a rising and falling curtain demarcates acts in a play.
Straight cut. The most common transition in most movies is a cut from one shot
to another, without any transition at all. Why? Because in the language of film, a
straight cut signals to the viewer the normal flow of time. More elaborate transi-
tions almost always imply a break in the flow of time—taking the viewer forward
in time or back to the past.
Actually, a good straight cut is deceptively simple. Some viewers take the straight
cut for granted, while filmmakers sweat over it. That’s because good filmmakers
use a specific visual grammar that prevents a straight cut from being jarring—a
film faux pas known as a jump cut. For example, suppose the subject of your
movie sits in a café wearing sunglasses, elbows on the table, talking earnestly to a
companion. If the next shot shows the same person leaning back, holding their
sunglasses in their hand, that’s a jump cut. Your audience will feel that they missed
something in between. On the other hand, a smooth straight cut would be a close-
up of the same person in the café, with their hands, glasses, and everything else in
the same position as the previous shot. Alternatively, if you want to imply that the
person has been sitting at the table talking for hours, that’s the perfect opportunity
for a transition.
Figure 6-1:
Premiere gives you a
bewildering number of
transition options. The 10
shown here represent a
fraction of those
available. Use the scroll
bar on the right (or the

more choices. If you

transition you want, type

Dissolve (page 179). The second-most-common transition is the dissolve, which
you’ve seen many times. One clip fades out as another fades in. For a moment, one
scene is superimposed over the other.
Dissolves can be short or long. Longer fades are more dramatic and often imply a
longer passage of time or some extraordinary change over time. (Keep in mind that a
“long” transition is something like three seconds; anything much longer and your
audience will lean forward in their seats wondering why the video has seized up.)
On the flip side, very short dissolves—a fraction of a second—can soften or
smooth a straight cut. The actual dissolve only affects a handful of frames; it happens
so quickly that it doesn’t necessarily imply the passage of time.
Since the 1940s, the great majority of feature films used these four transitions, seldom
venturing into more exotic territory. When a filmmaker uses a fancy transition,
she tends to call attention to the effect rather than the narrative, to the point of dis-
rupting the flow of the film. For example, see Figure 6-2. If, as you use transitions
or other effects, your audience spends more time thinking about a transition, they
may not be paying attention to the narrative of the film.
Famous Movie Moment: In Martin Scorsese’s The Departed, he uses an iris effect to frame Matt
Damon on the streets of Boston. Most of the screen is stark black. Finally, the lens opens to full-frame, and
you see that Damon is in front of a government building, about to start his new job.
The transition jumps out in the movie. It’s such an artificial and manipulative effect that it makes you won-
der why Scorsese chose it for that moment in the film. Is it an homage to Hitchcock or D.W. Griffith? Did
the cameraman forget to bring his zoom lens? Or is Scorcese effectively portraying the apprehension and
sense of isolation one feels at the start of a new job, particularly one fraught with danger?
Needless to say, Scorcese knows filmmaking (The Departed won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars)
and uses every element in his movies for a reason. You need to follow the same rationale.
Apply a Transition
In Premiere, it’s as easy to apply a transition as it is to add a clip to your movie.
You simply find the right transition and drag it into place. You can apply transi-
tions from the sceneline or the timeline. The next couple of exercises show you
how to add a traditional set of transitions to a short movie. You probably have
your own clips to work with, but if not, download the three short clips of a flower
garden from this book’s Missing CD (download the file transitions_begin_ch06.zip
at http://missingmanuals.com/cds).
Apply Transitions in the Sceneline
To apply a transition, start at the sceneline with your clips in place. If you’re inter-
ested in seeing how transitions affect the runtime of your movie, you may want to
note the clip lengths and the overall movie length. For example if you use the
flower clips from the Missing CD, you can trim each one to run 5 seconds, making

178
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Apply a Transition
the entire movie 15 seconds long. (If you need a refresher on adding clips to the
sceneline, see page 164. For trimming clips, see page 156.) After you add these
transitions, you can compare the new movie length with the old.
The following steps show you how to apply cross-dissolve transitions between your
clips and a dip-to-black transition at the beginning and end of your video. You’ll
end up with a brief movie that has a traditional set of transitions.
1. Click the Edit tab.
The Tasks panel displays your editing tools. Buttons at the top lead to Effects,
Transitions, Titles, Themes, and Clip Art. Initially, the panel displays Effects.
2. Click the Transitions button (it looks like an arrow).
The Tasks panel displays dozens of transitions, grouped into categories like 3D
Motion, Dissolve, Iris, and GPU Transitions. (GPU stands for “graphics proces-
sor unit”—the brain behind fancier video cards. Some of Premiere’s transitions
and special effects require one of these cards.)
If you haven’t decided which transition to use, you can get a mini-preview. Each
thumbnail displays the letters A and B. The A represents the first clip in the transi-
tion and the B the second. Move your cursor over one of the transitions, and the
animated thumbnail previews the transition as it goes from A to B.
Figure 6-2:
Fancy transitions, like the
oval iris shown here, may
detract from your movie
if they call more attention
to themselves than the
subject.

3. Drag the cross-dissolve transition to the small box between the first and second
clips in the sceneline.
An icon representing the transition fills the box between the two clips, as shown
in Figure 6-3. Premiere works hard to make sure that the addition of a transi-
tion doesn’t change the overall length of your movie—check its duration by
opening the Info window (Window ➝Info) and then selecting all the clips. For
more details on transitions and movie length, see the box on page 181.
4. Right-click the empty transition box between the second and third clips and
then choose Dissolve ➝ Cross Dissolve.
The Cross Dissolve transition appears between the two clips, just as it did when
you manually dragged it from the Tasks panel. You can use whichever method
works best for you.
5. Now go back to the first transition in the sceneline and click it.
Premiere moves the playhead to a point just before the transition. To preview
the transition in all its glory, you need to see at least a few seconds of your clip
before and after the transition—which is why Premiere positions the playhead a
little ahead of the effect. If you want to see more of the lead-in clip, drag the
playhead a little more to the left. If all you want to see is the transition, you can
double-click the transition itself.
6. Press the space bar.
Your movie plays back in the monitor. The clip images dissolve from one to the
next. If the playback is rough or choppy, press the Enter key to render the
movie before you view it.
7. Drag the Dip to Black transition to the boxes at the beginning and end of your
movie.
The Dip to Black transition makes your movie fade in from a black screen and
fade out to a black one.
8. Click the first Dip to Black transition.
The playhead moves to the first frame of your movie.
9. Press the space bar.
Your movie plays back in the monitor. When the movie ends, Premiere dis-
plays the movie’s running time in the lower-left corner of the sceneline. Note
that adding transitions didn’t change the duration.
The cross-dissolve is such a popular transition that it’s one Premiere uses by
default. To change the default transitions, go to Window ➝Transitions and select
a new transition from the Tasks panel. Right-click the transition and choose Set
Selected as Default Transition.

Edit Transitions in the Timeline
Click the timeline button, and you see a different view of the Transitions work
area. As usual, the timeline gives you a bit more information about your movie
than the sceneline does, and more editing control, too. In the timeline, the transi-
tions you added appear above the video portion of your clips, as shown in
Figure 6-4. (You may have to expand the video track horizontally to reproduce this
look.) Right-click on an empty spot in the timeline and choose Track Size ➝Large
or use the Zoom slider above the timeline.
You work with transitions in the timeline as if they were video clips. Using the
Selection tool (V), click a transition to highlight it. Move a transition by dragging
it to a new location. Delete it by selecting it and pressing Delete. Change the tim-
ing by trimming its ends, as shown later in Figure 6-6.
Tip: You can change a transition’s alignment so that it’s before the cut, after the cut, or centered on the
cut. You do that by editing the transition as explained on page 186.
UP TO SPEED
How Transitions Affect the Length of Your Movie
Most transitions display images from two adjacent clips at
the same time. You’d think that all this overlapping would
shorten the running time of your movie. Normally, that
would be the case, but Premiere goes to near-heroic
lengths to preserve your movie’s running time and the cuts
you’ve made from one clip to another.
Remember that you trimmed frames from the beginning and
end of many of your clips. Premiere uses those trimmed ends
to create the transition. If you haven’t trimmed an end, Pre-
miere duplicates the last frame on clip A and/or the first
frame on clip B. This solution works well most of the time. But
there are times when Premiere’s solution doesn’t work with
your clips. In those cases, you need to jump in and manually
adjust the transition, as explained below.
Figure 6-4:
Premiere represents
transitions using a
rectangle with arrows.
Here, the transition
between the second and
third clip is selected and

Edit Transitions in
the Timeline
The steps below continue the transition exercise started on page 177. If you followed
those steps, you now have a three-clip movie with transitions in place.
1. Click the Timeline button.
The timeline shows your movie with Dip to Black transitions at the beginning
and end. Cross-dissolve transitions are in place where two clips meet.
2. Select the cross-dissolve transition between the first and second clip and then
press Delete.
Premiere removes the transition. At this point, there’s a straight cut between the
first and second clip.
3. If necessary, go to Window ➝ Transitions to view the full list of transitions.
As an alternative, you can click the Tasks panel’s Edit tab and then click the
Transition button.
4. Drag the Spin Away transition from the Transitions panel to the point where
the first and second clips meet.
The transition snaps to one of three places over the splice, depending on where
you had it when you let go of the mouse: It ends up at the end of clip one, the
beginning of clip two, or straddles both. As explained in the box on page 181,
Premiere creates a transition using frames you trimmed from the clip earlier or,
if you haven’t done any trimming, by duplicating existing end frames.
5. Click the timeline in front of the new transition and then press the space bar.
Premiere previews the transition in the monitor. If the effect appears choppy,
press the Enter key to render the transition.
6. OK, go ahead and test a bunch of the goofy transitions.
You know you can’t resist.
7. Drag the transition to the timeline.
When you first drag a transition to the timeline, it snaps into position as
described in Step 4. After it’s in place, you can slide the transition to any posi-
tion over the splice. As you place the transition, you can see where in your film
it will end up because the monitor displays two side-by-side frames—the last
frame of the first clip and the first frame of the second clip (Figure 6-5).
8. Drag the front end of the transition toward the beginning of the timeline.
The duration of the transition increases as you resize it in the timeline. As you
do so, a tooltip displays the change in the duration (Figure 6-6). For example, if
you move the left end of the transition five frames to the left, the tooltip shows a
negative time: –00;00;00;05. You can resize transitions from either end.

As you can see from Step 6, you can make some basic changes to the timing of any
transition from the timeline. If you need to make more specific edits, see the tech-
niques described on page 184.

Add Transitions to Favorites
If you’re like most video editors, you have a few transitions you use most of the
time. Premiere gives you a place to keep these favorites so you don’t have to scroll
through the entire list of transitions each time you want one. To add a transition to
Premiere’s Favorites panel, right-click the transition in the Tasks panel and then
choose Add to Favorites from the shortcut menu. To view your favorites, choose
Favorites from the transitions menu, as shown in Figure 6-7.
You can add as many transitions to the Favorites panel as you want. If you decide
that a particular transition is no longer a fave, click on it and hit Delete. Premiere
removes the transition from Favorites, though it’s still available in the standard
transitions panel.
Edit Transitions in the Tasks Panel
There may be times when you want to fine-tune a transition to your own satisfac-
tion. You might, for example, find that a stock cross-dissolve transition overlays
two frames more quickly than you like.
You can only edit a transition once it’s in the timeline or sceneline—you can’t
right-click a transition in the Transitions panel and customize it. To edit a transi-
tion, select it in the timeline and click the Edit Transition button in the lower-left
corner of the Transitions panel. When the Properties panel appears, tweak the
transition as much as you want.
Tip: To edit a transition that’s in the timeline, double-click it, or right-click it and choose Show Properties
(Figure 6-8).

Preview a Transition While Editing
The top-right corner of the Properties panel displays the name of the transition
you’re customizing, along with a preview window. To see the effect of the changes
you made, click the Play/Stop button to the right of the Preview window. At first,
Premiere shows you the boring A and B frames for a transition. If your computer
has the horsepower to display transitions smoothly, turn on the checkbox “Show
Actual Sources” (you may have to scroll down to see it). This replaces the A and B
frames with the actual frames from your movie. (With the Spin Away transition
and some others, you can also change the direction of the transition’s motion by
clicking one of the small triangles surrounding the thumbnail.)
Trim Transitions with the Mini-Timeline
Click the Show/Hide Timeline button on the right side of the Properties panel (it
looks like a stopwatch) to display a mini-timeline that helps you visualize the three
elements of a transition. The A clip (the first clip) appears at the top, the transi-
tion is in the middle, and the B clip sits at the bottom. A vertical line indicates the
splice—the point of the straight cut between the two clips.
You drag the ends of the clips or the transition itself to change the timing of the
transition. As you do, the monitor guides you in the edit by displaying the last
frame of the first clip and the first frame of the second clip.
Figure 6-8:
At first glance, the Properties panel
for transitions may seem a little

To reposition the transition, either drag the transition itself (the middle purple
element) or, in the timeline, drag the splice point (the vertical line).
The mini-timeline is a true timeline, with a playhead and your movie’s time scale
at the top. If you don’t see the playhead, click the time scale to move it into view.
Move the playhead in front of the transition and press the space bar to preview
your transition in the monitor—a larger and much better view than the one the
tiny thumbnail gives you.
Change Transition Properties
On the left side of the Properties panel, you see a list of transition properties you con-
trol by checkboxes, number boxes, menus, and other selection tools. Some of these
properties, such as duration, alignment, start/end points, and “Show Actual Sources”,
are common to all transitions. Others deal with a particular transition’s effects.
As usual with numerical/time properties like Duration you can change these set-
tings by clicking on them and typing in a new number, or you can click and drag
to scrub to a new number.
The Alignment settings, which give you four options for positioning a transition,
appear on a drop-down menu. Your options are Center at Cut, Start at Cut, End at
Cut, and Custom Start. These are similar to the options available when you drag a
transition to the timeline or drag it within the timeline.
The Start/End Points don’t relate to the movie’s timeline, they’re relative to the
transition’s timeline. For example, you can change the start point of a Page Curl
transition, so that it begins with the page already partly curled up.
Use the Reverse checkbox to play a transition backwards. For example, you can
have a page-curl transition appear to curl onto the screen as opposed to having it
curl off.
Tip: When you drop a transition into the timeline, Premiere sets the duration at 30 frames. To change
this default setting, go to Edit ➝Preferences ➝General and change the value in Video Transition Default
Duration.
Some transition properties, like the Border Color property found in the Page Peel
transition, apply color to the transition (make sure you specify a border width for
the transition to display this effect). A color chip and an eye dropper icon appear
next to the property. Specify a color by clicking the eyedropper icon, and your cur-
sor changes to an eyedropper. You can click any color in the Premiere window to
have the page match that color. For example, you might want the transition color
to reflect the predominant hue in the scene prior to the transition. You’re not lim-
ited to the image in the monitor, either—you can click on Premiere’s tabs, image
frames, and even the purple pre icon in the menu bar. The selected color appears in
the color chip, and Premiere uses it as the setting for the border color.

Chapter 6: Add Transitions
187
Edit Transitions in
the Tasks Panel
If you don’t see the color you want in the Premiere window, or if you want more
precision and control over your color selection, click the color chip. A color picker
window opens, as shown in Figure 6-9. You can specify a color several ways. The
easiest is to use the vertical slider to select a hue and then click somewhere within
the large square to choose a specific shade.
There’s another way to specify color, too. Graphic artists use a standardized set of
numbers to represent specific colors. One standard is known as the color’s RGB
(Red, Green, Blue) value, which stands for the relative amount of the three pri-
mary colors (red, green, and blue) it takes to produce a specific color. The RGB
value for royal blue, for example, is 51 red, 102 green, and 255 blue.
Premiere’s color picker accommodates the RGB scale and several other standards:
HSB (hue, saturation, brightness), HSL (hue, saturation, luminance), YUV (lumi-
nance, 2 chroma channels), and a hexadecimal number (for example, #FF0033).
Change a Transition’s Center Point
Transitions with motion may make use of the center point, the point in a video
frame around which the transition takes place. For example, the Tumble Away
transition shows clip A flipping around and getting smaller until it disappears. Pre-
miere initially centers this motion; however, you can move it off-center by dragging
the center point to a new location, as shown in Figure 6-10.
As you edit a transition, Premiere only lists options for the properties that a transi-
tion uses. The old standby cross-dissolve, for example, doesn’t move an image in
any direction—it simply replaces one image with another—so there’s no option to
change the direction of the effect when you edit a cross dissolve.

No matter how you
choose a color—by
entering a number or by
using the slider and color
box—all the related color
values are shown in the

Customize Iris Transitions
Iris transitions go from one frame to the next using a geometric shape as the
medium for the transition—for example, the Iris Diamond transition starts off
pinhead-size diamond in the center of the screen, which gradually gets larger until
it takes over the screen, in the process replacing the initial frame with the new one.
The Iris transition provides several standard shapes and gives you tools to customize
it. Follow these steps to explore the options:
1. Choose Window ➝ Transitions.
Premiere displays the transitions in the Tasks panel.
2. Choose Video Transitions from the Transitions drop-down menu.
3. In the drop-down menu to the right, choose Iris.
Premiere displays the iris transitions. Most of them name the geometric shape
they use, such as Iris Box, Iris Round, or Iris Star.
The Group menu is to the right of the Transitions menu and limits the displayed
transitions to specific groups such as 3D Motion, Dissolve, or Iris.

6. At the bottom of the Properties panel, click the Custom button (you may have
to scroll down to see it).
The Iris Shapes Settings panel appears over the Properties panel, as shown
Figure 6-11.
7. Select one of the radio buttons: Rectangle, Oval, or Diamond.
The shape changes based on your choice, and it becomes the basic shape for the
iris effect. Initially, the Diamond shape is used for the effect, but you can change
it to a rectangular shape, as shown in Figure 6-12.
Use the “Wide” and “High” sliders to change the size and quantity of shapes
used for the iris effect.

Audio Transitions
transitions are much leaner. In fact, you choose from only two: Constant Power
and Constant Gain. Both work by changing the volume of the audio, making it
seem to fade. The audio mechanics used to do the job differ for each effect, but the
end result is that Constant Power provides a seemingly smoother fade, while Con-
stant Gain seems more abrupt.
To apply an audio transition, go to the first pull-down menu in the Transitions
panel and select Audio Transitions. Select either Constant Gain or Constant Power
and drag it to the audio track in the timeline (it doesn’t matter if the track is linked
to or unlinked from a video clip). You can drop the audio transition only at the
beginning or end of an audio clip and only on one side of a splice or the other. As
with video transitions, you can change the transition’s duration by dragging the
end of it in the timeline, as shown in Figure 6-13.
Place a transition at the end of an audio clip to fade the volume down. Place it at
the beginning of a clip to fade the volume up. It’s easiest to change the duration in
the timeline, but you can edit audio transitions in the Properties panel, too. Double-
click the transition or right click it and then choose Show Properties.
Premiere uses Constant Power as the standard audio transition. To change that, go
to Window ➝Transitions, select Audio Transitions from the left-most drop-down
menu, right-click the Constant Gain transition (your only other choice), and
choose “Set Selected as Default Transition”.

Types of Transitions
Transitions and Slideshows
Creating slideshows is a Premiere specialty. You assemble still images in the scene-
line or timeline, along with various special effects, and then save the results in a
video file or burn them to DVD. Transitions add visual interest to slideshows.
Premiere uses standard transitions for slideshows: Cross-dissolves for images and
constant power for audio. To change either of them, drag a new transition on top
of the old one.
Types of Transitions
Premiere offers dozens of transitions—some in good taste, some not so good.
3D Motion. These are some of Premiere’s flashiest transitions—the type that call
attention to the effect itself. Here you’ll find spinning cubes, opening curtains, and
opening doors. You can make clips fold up and disappear or spin away into oblivion.
Dissolve. The dissolve transitions include the classic cross-dissolve, one of the best
known and least obtrusive of the genre. You can create different effects by chang-
ing its duration. The Dissolve category also includes Dip to Black and Dip to
White, which are essentially dissolves and from black or white. Black is a standard
effect, especially at the beginning and end of a movie or scene. White, on the other
hand, has an eerie effect without getting too flashy. The Additive and Non-Additive
dissolves play color tricks, while the Dither and Random Invert effects use dots and
blocks of video.
GPU Transitions. These effects require a bit more video processing horsepower, so
you can only use them if your computer has a video card with its own processor.
The effects include Card Flip, Center Peel, Page Curl, Page Roll, and Sphere. Don’t
feel bad if you can’t use these transitions, there are others that are similar.

Types of Transitions
Iris. Iris transitions are all based on geometric shapes that tend to look like cookie
cutters. The term comes from the “iris” of a camera, the internal contraption that
lets more or less light hit a piece of film. Early filmmakers (we’re talking Buster
Keaton and Charlie Chaplin here) opened and closed the camera’s iris to create in-
camera transitions for their movies.
Map. Premiere has only two map transitions, and they have nothing to do with
geography. They use video color tricks to create special effects. For example, you
can map one color to appear as a different color. So, during the effect, all reds can
appear green, blue, or transparent. The Luminance transition plays off of the
image’s brightness and darkness.
NewBlue 3D Explosions Elements. Yep, these transitions do pretty much what
you’d expect (Figure 6-14). You get nearly 10 ways to slice, dice, bounce, and blow
up your images.
NewBlue 3D Transformations Elements. These transitions turn clips into folded
boxes, checkerboards, magic carpets, and other distorted forms.
NewBlue Art Blends Elements. A little more subtle than the other NewBlue transi-
tions, this group primarily uses color effects such as glow, halo, and metallic effects.
NewBlue Motion Blends Elements. These 2D effects include things like roll, shake,
shear, spin, and wave.
Page Peel. This group boasts a variety of page-peel transitions, the main differ-
ences between them being the method of turning the page.
Picture Wipes. These transitions move cartoonish images, such as a road sign,
across the frame to reveal the follow-on frame. Options include Stars, Travel, and
Wedding.

Slide. If you want to slide your images on and off the screen every which way, take
a look at this group. You’ll find more than a dozen ways to create bars, bands,
spins, swirls, and sliding boxes.
Special Effects. This group includes some video-intensive effects, including an
Image Mask effect where you supply a custom shape for an iris-like effect.
Stretch. The Stretch transitions offer ways to stretch, squash, and otherwise distort
your images.
Wipe. You have the tools to wipe images across the screen in every imaginable
direction and shape. Wipe effects include transitions with names like Barn Doors,
Checker Wipe, Gradient Wipe, Pinwheel, Venetian Blinds (Figure 6-15), and Zig-
Zag Blocks.
Zoom. These transitions simulate the effect of a camera zooming in and out on an
image. Some include shapes such as boxes; others superimpose images where one
clip zooms in while the other zooms out, as in the Cross Zoom.
Note: You can get additional transitions from Photoshop.com, though some effects and transitions are
available to paid members only.

Add Effects and Themes
After you assemble the rough cut of your movie, it’s time to think about effects
that enhance it—make it look and sound better and give it a more polished look.
Premiere gives you a toolbox full of video and audio effects (Figure 7-1)—in fact,
you might be surprised at how many there are (and how useful they are). If you
have footage with exposure problems, Premiere can adjust the brightness and
increase the contrast. Have a clip with a green hue to it? Premiere’s color-correction
effects can fix it. Want to twist, twirl, and distort your image in any of a dozen dif-
ferent ways? Premiere can help you there, too.
Even though different effects perform entirely different tasks, you apply and edit
the effects consistently—one of Premiere’s smarter features. This chapter teaches
you the basics of adding effects to your movie, and making first-level edits.
Chapter 8 takes you to the next level, telling you how to control the timing of
effects on a frame-by-frame basis.
In addition to the effects Premiere offers, you can create your own snazzy effects
using Premiere’s timeline tools. This chapter explains how to speed up or slow
down your clips and how to play an entire clip in reverse. You’ll also learn a few
video magic tricks, such as picture-in-picture displays and “green screen” keying.
So, if you’re ready, roll up your sleeves and dig into effects and themes.
Choose an Effect
When it comes to video, an effect can be as subtle as a minor color adjustment or
as dramatic as a hallucinatory distortion of someone’s face. In many ways, effects

196
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Choose an Effect
are similar to the transitions described in Chapter 6. The difference is that you
always apply transitions to the ends of clips, while you can apply an effect to an
entire clip.
Special effects are fun, but it’s important to make sure they’re as much fun for your
audience as they are for you. As with the transitions discussed in Chapter 6, if you
want people to take your film seriously, choose your effects carefully. If you’re just
having fun, that’s a different story.

Fixed Versus Standard Effects
Premiere has two types of effects: fixed and standard. In many ways, the two are
similar. For example, both types appear in the Properties panel of a clip, where you
can edit the effect by adjusting its properties using sliders, checkboxes, and num-
bers. Still, understanding how fixed and standard effects differ can save you some
video-editing aggravation.
Fixed Effects. Premiere embeds five fixed effects with every movie clip you add to
the timeline; three of them are video effects (Image Control, Motion, and Opacity),
and two are audio effects (Volume and Balance). Technically, these aren’t really
“effects,” they’re video and audio properties. But by grouping them in with effects,
you can use a common set of tools to adjust both a clip’s properties and its special
effects. It’s a smart move you’ll come to appreciate.
Fixed effects are always present; you don’t add them to your clips, and you can’t
delete them from your clips. For the most part, they’re fairly subtle. If you don’t
make any adjustments to them, your video and audio looks and sounds the same
as it did when you recorded it.
Standard Effects. Premiere comes with dozens of standard effects, and you can
order more from companies that specialize in creating them. In the standard
effects group, you find everything from understated color-correcting tricks to
flashy Industrial Light and Magic kind of effects, like Blur, Ripple, and Twirl. Go to
Window ➝ Effects to see what Premiere has to offer.
You need to manually apply a standard effect to a clip by dragging it from the
Effects panel to a clip in the sceneline or timeline (you can also drag an effect
directly to the monitor). After you do, the effect appears in the Properties panel,
where you can edit it.
You don’t have to settle for a single effect per clip; Premiere lets you apply multi-
ple effects to any clip. In addition, by changing the order of the effects, you can
change the look of the clip. Finally, unlike fixed effects, you can reposition or
delete standard effects.
Premiere’s themes and its InstantMovie feature use standard effects, automatically
applying them to your movie (in addition to applying other elements, such as tran-
sitions and titles). See page 233 for more on Premiere’s themes.
Customize a Fixed Effect
Drag a clip to the timeline, and it automatically gets Image Control, Motion, and
Opacity values. All you have to do is select a clip and then click the Properties but-
ton above the timeline (see Figure 7-2), and Premiere displays controls for these
fixed effects. Initially, Premiere sets the properties so that it displays your clip just
as you shot it. So, for example, Premiere sets a clip’s opacity to 100 percent, making

198
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Choose an Effect
the clip fully visible, with no transparency applied to it. It also sets the clip’s scale
to 100 percent, so the clip takes up the full playback window. You can edit these
properties as you go along to get different effects. Some of the examples in this
chapter show you how.
Tip: You can work with effects from the sceneline, but you’ll have more options and get more out of the
effects if you view your movie in the timeline. Through the rest of this chapter, the description and exer-
cises assume you’re in the Timeline View.
To see the fixed effects that are part of every clip and to make a few changes, follow
these steps:
1. In Premiere, choose File ➝ New ➝ Project.
If you already have a project open, Premiere asks if you want to save it. Once
you’re past that, a box appears where you provide a name and settings for your
new project (see page 23). Once you do, click OK.
2. Drag a clip from the Media panel (Organize tab ➝ Media) to the timeline.
Your timeline holds a single, unaltered clip. You’ll see a yellow horizontal line
near the top that runs the length of the clip.
Tip: If you need a better view of the timeline, right-click an empty part of it and choose Track Size ➝
Large.

you haven’t selected a clip to edit yet.
4. Click the clip in the timeline and then click the Edit Effects button (or click the
Properties button above the timeline).
Premiere displays the Properties panel, listing all the clip’s effects. Even though
you haven’t added any effects to the clip, you see five of them listed already.
These are the clip’s fixed effects: the three fixed video effects (Image Control,
Motion, and Opacity) and the two fixed audio effects (Volume and Balance).
5. Click the triangle button next to Opacity.
The slider for clip opacity is set to 100 percent (Figure 7-3). Use the slider to
change the opacity or click the 100.0% number and scrub it to a different opac-
ity, anywhere from 0 to 100 percent. You can also change the opacity by clicking
the number to highlight it and then typing in a new number.
Two buttons, labeled Fade In and Fade Out, sit below the slider.
6. Drag the slider to about 50 percent.
The clip becomes half-transparent as you change its opacity. Note that as you
drag the slider, the yellow line within the clip changes position—it moves down
in this case. Think of that line as a graph line that reflects the value of a clip’s
properties, opacity in this example.
7. Press the space bar.
Premiere previews the clip at its new opacity. Changes you make as you edit a
clip’s properties take effect immediately and appear in the monitor (so long as
you position the playhead over the clip you’re editing). You don’t have to leave
the Properties panel to preview your movie with the effect in place.
8. Click the Fade In and the Fade Out buttons, then click Done.
Each end of the clip’s yellow line dips down toward the bottom of the clip, indi-
cating an even lower opacity at these points.
When you click the Done button, the Tasks panel changes to the Effects View.
9. Press the Home button and then press the space bar.
The Home button moves the playhead to the first frame of your video. The
space bar toggles the Play button. After all these changes, your clip fades in until
it reaches an opacity of 50 percent, then it fades to black at the end.

Choose an Effect
Follow these steps to add a standard effect to the clip in your timeline:
1. Choose Window ➝ Effects.
The Tasks panel shows all the available effects. You can use the drop-down
menus at the top of the panel to filter the display, making it a little easier to find
the effect you want. (On the other hand, if you know the name of the effect you
want, type it into the Search box.)
2. In the first Effects drop-down menu (at the top-left side of the panel), choose
Video Effects.
Unless you used this menu before in the same work session, Video Effects
appears when you first open the Effects panel.
3. In the second drop-down menu, to the right of the first (which this book will
call the secondary menu), choose Distort.
The Effects panel displays all the Distort effects available. The choices include
Bend, Mirror, and Wave Warp.
4. Drag the Mirror effect to the clip in your timeline.
The effect immediately changes the image in the monitor.
5. Position the playhead just before the clip and press the space bar.
Premiere applies the Mirror effect to your clip, as shown in Figure 7-4, and you
see the results during playback.
6. Click on the clip and then click the Properties button.
The Mirror effect appears in the Properties panel, along with the fixed effects
that are part of every clip.
As you add effects to your project, you edit them here. For example, the Mirror
effect has three settings. Two of them position the center point of the reflection
and the third changes the angle of the reflection.
7. Drag the number next to Reflection Angle to the left, then release the mouse
button.
Dragging the number scrubs a new value into the number box. As you change
the value, the angle of the image’s reflection changes.
8. Click the eyeball button next to “Mirror”.
The eyeball button toggles an effect on and off. When you toggle an effect off, Pre-
miere doesn’t display it during playback (or include it when it exports a movie).

9. Toggle the effect back on and click Done in the lower-right corner of the Tasks
panel. The Properties panel closes and you return to the list of Distort effects.
Usually, you apply standard effects one clip at a time; but you can apply an effect
to several clips at once, using Shift-click to preselect the clips and then dragging the
effect to any of the selected clips. Preview your movie and the effect shows up in all
the clips.
Copy and Paste Effects
If you develop an effect you particularly like, you can copy it to other clips. If you
plan to use it across many projects, create a preset effect as described on page 217.
If you just want to copy an effect to another clip in the same timeline, you can exe-
cute a simple copy and paste operation, as you would in a word processor.
To copy and paste a single effect, select a clip that has the effect you want to copy.
Click the Properties button (or right-click the clip and select Show Properties or
choose Window ➝Properties). Then, from the Properties panel, right-click on the
name of the effect and choose Copy from the shortcut menu. Click the target clip
and, in the Properties panel, right-click in an empty spot and select Paste from the
shortcut menu.
To copy and paste more than one effect, Ctrl+click or Shift+click the effects you
want to copy. Then click the target clip and choose Paste from the shortcut menu.
To copy and paste all of a clip’s effects, right-click a clip and choose Copy from
the shortcut menu (it’s a long menu; the standard Cut, Copy, and Paste com-
mands are at the top). Then, right-click the target clip and choose Paste Attributes.

Using either method, you can paste effects to more than one clip at a time. Hold
down the shift key to select multiple target clips (each clip highlights in purple
when you select it). Right-click on one of the clips and choose the Paste Attributes
command.
Apply an Effect to Part of Your Image
In graphics arts, a “mask” conceals (and protects) part of an image while you work on
another part of it. Premiere lets you apply a mask to a clip so you can add an effect to
just a portion of a clip. You can use this technique to produce a dramatic effect, like
the Solarize effect shown in Figure 7-5. Or you can use it to subtly enhance part of
your image. Here are the steps you take to add an effect using a mask:
1. Start with a video clip in the timeline.
You can think of this initial clip as your background.
2. Choose Stylize from the Video Effects’ secondary menu, then drag Solarize to
your clip.
When you first apply the effect, it covers the entire image.
3. Right-click on the clip and choose Effects Mask ➝ Apply from the shortcut menu.
The mask appears as a rectangle on top of your image, with the effect shown in
the rectangle; the rest of the image is unaffected. You may notice that Premiere
has added a duplicate video clip in the track above the background clip, as
shown in Figure 7-5 (you may have to scroll up in the timeline to see it). The
two clips are linked; when you select one clip, you automatically select the other
one, too.
4. On the monitor, drag the mask to reposition it.
Click the middle of the image to reposition the effect. You can drag the mask to
any position over your background image.
Notice that, as you reposition the mask, the effect changes only the portion of
the image that’s under the mask.
5. Drag a handle on the mask’s border to change its proportions.
As you drag, the mask changes shape, applying more or less of the effect to the
underlying image. Unfortunately, masks are always rectangular.
Premiere isn’t fussy about the order of the steps you take when you apply a mask.
For example, you can apply the mask first (right-click a clip and choose Effects
Mask ➝Apply from the shortcuts) and then add an effect. If you want to edit the
mask after you apply it, click on your clip in the timeline and then choose Effects
Mask ➝Edit. Premiere automatically selects the mask for you and you can move
and reshape it as much as you want.

Remove an Effect
Premiere makes it easy to remove all the effects from a clip. Right-click the clip and
then, from the shortcut menu, choose Remove Effect ➝All Effects. If you want to
remove video effects only, choose Video Effects from the submenu. Likewise,
choose Audio Effects to remove all the audio effects only.
You can apply more than one effect to a clip, so there will be times when you want
to remove just one effect from the several you applied. Here are the steps to do so:
1. In the timeline, right-click the clip with the effect you want to remove and
choose Show Properties from the shortcut menu (shown earlier in Figure 7-2)
or click the clip and choose Window ➝ Properties.
The Properties panel shows all the fixed and standard effects for that clip.
Figure 7-5:
When you “mask” an
effect you can limit the
effect to just a portion of
your video image. Here
the Solarize effect is
applied to just a part of
the image of a flower.

2. Right-click the effect you want to remove.
A shortcut menu displays several commands, including Cut, Copy, Paste, and
Clear. Grayed-out options are unavailable for the clip at the moment. For
example, you can’t cut or clear fixed effects because, as mentioned earlier, you
can’t remove fixed effects from a clip.
3. Choose Cut or Clear.
Choose Clear to remove the effect, but choose Cut if you want to paste the
effect to another clip.
If you want to temporarily prevent an effect from…well, from having an effect, see
the next section.
Disable an Effect
You can temporarily disable both fixed and standard effects. The effect remains in
place, but you don’t see it in the monitor or when you encode your movie.
To disable an effect, click the eyeball icon next to the effect’s name (Figure 7-6).
The icon box turns solid gray. Toggling the eyeball on and off gives you a great way
to compare a clip with and without the effect.

Color-Correct an Image
Video effects aren’t always blockbuster attention-getters. Some of Premiere’s
effects simply fix problems in so-so clips. Color correction—making colors look
natural, yet striking—is a huge task, part art and part science. In fact, color-correction
is such a challenging undertaking that some people spend their whole career fixing
color for both movies and still images.
Color correction for video is complex because you’re not just correcting color for a
single image; you’re trying to fix hundreds of images. So if you’re new to correct-
ing color, think of it as a swimming pool and then decide whether you want to
stick your toe in, wade in up to your waist, or take a swim in the deep end. If
you’re unfamiliar with some of the color-correction terms used here, see the box
below.
So, how do you know when an image needs color correction? You have to trust
your own eyeballs. Is it way too dark for a daytime shot? Does the whole image
seem a little green? Do all the clips in a sequence (in film, a series of related scenes
is called a sequence) have the same look, or does one seem out of place because of
its color or exposure? Start your color-correction adventures working on the most
obvious problems, and you’ll gain skill and confidence over time.
Apply Image Control Effects
For the simplest level of color correction, you can use Premiere’s Image Control
effect, which applies basic image settings—for brightness, contrast, and hue and
saturation. Image Control is one of Premiere’s fixed effects.
To work with Image Control, select an image in the timeline and choose Window
➝Properties. The Properties window displays the clip’s fixed effects and any oth-
ers you applied.
UP TO SPEED
Color Correction Glossary
Like most professions, the color correction pros have a slew
of words they use to describe their work. If you’re familiar
with still photography, some are familiar.
Brightness. Is an image light or dark overall? Often a single
video clip may be too bright or too dark in some of the
frames.
Contrast. How well do the colors separate from each
other? Is it a muddy indistinguishable mess, or do different
colors and shades pop out? Often, brightness and contrast
need to be adjusted at the same time.
Hue. The same as tint, it refers to the overall color. An
image may appear to have too much green or red. The type
of light—morning light, interior lamp light—has a major
effect on an image’s hue.
Saturation. Vibrant, vivid colors are said to be saturated.
Colors that are ghostly and faded are not.
Highlights, Shadows, and Midtones. Color pros often
separate parts of an image into the light portion, the dark
portion, and the midportion. In a black-and-white image,
the hightlights are closer to white, the shadows are closer
to black, and the midtones are neutral gray.

Chapter 7: Add Effects and Themes
207
Color-Correct an
Image
The brightness, contrast, and hue and saturation controls may remind you of the
ones you use to adjust your TV set and computer monitor. For best results, adjust
the settings working from the top (Brightness) down (Hue and Saturation). That
way, you correct a clip’s exposure first and then you make changes to its hue and
saturation if necessary.
Tip: As you make adjustments, Premiere previews your changes in the thumbnail at the top of the Prop-
erties panel. But the thumbnail is so small that the changes are hard to see. Position the playhead on the
clip so the preview appears in the much larger monitor window.
For example, if your clip is underexposed, increase its brightness first. Most of the
time, you want to use a light hand when color-correcting an image. As explained in
Figure 7-7, you can adjust these setting using the slider or by scrubbing in a value.
Often, if you increase the brightness, the image looks a little washed out, so you
may want to increase its contrast, too. Adjusting the contrast separates an image’s
colors from each other without changing the image brightness.
After you make exposure adjustments, you may or may not need to change an
image’s hue and saturation. If you do, make small, incremental changes. It’s always
helpful to compare the corrected image to the original. That’s where the enable/
disable toggle button (Figure 7-6) comes in handy. Click the eyeball icon next to
the effect’s name (Image Control here) to turn it on and off.
Figure 7-7:
When you color-correct, instead of using
the slider to adjust brightness, try
scrubbing in a new value by clicking and
dragging a value in the number box. The
value changes more slowly, making it
easier to find just the right setting.

Apply Auto Color-Correction
Another easy way to improve a clip is to use Premiere’s “auto” adjustment tools.
They analyze your images and make adjustments based on built-in formulas. Go to
the Edit tab and click the Effects button to see all the effects Premiere offers.
Choose Video Effects from the left drop-down menu and Adjust from the second-
ary menu to see Premiere’s auto tools. The group includes a huge range of effects,
including those that make subtle changes, such as Auto Color and Brightness &
Contrast, to effects that are far more conspicuous, like Extract (removes all the
color in a clip) and Posterize (reduces the variety of tones in an image, making it
appear “flat”).
Use Auto Color when you want to apply a quick image-quality fix to an entire clip.
Auto color changes a clip’s contrast and hue. Color-correction pros usually divide
an image into three parts: shadows, highlights, and midtones. Often, only one or
two of these settings need help. For example, the shadowy areas of your image may
be so dark that they have few or no details. The Auto Color effect analyzes these
three characteristics in each clip and makes the needed changes. Other effects, such
as Shadow Highlight, correct these attributes independently.
Use Auto Contrast if the image seems washed out and you want more separation
between the lighter and darker colors.
Use Brightness & Contrast if your image is over- or under-exposed but you’re
happy with the colors. Premiere adjusts brightness and contrast in tandem since, if
you change the brightness to fix exposure problems, you usually need to tweak the
contrast. If the image seems overly blue or overly yellow, try the Auto Color effect.
Use Auto Levels when your image has brightness or hue problems (when an image
takes on an unnatural color, or it’s too bright or too dark). For example, video shot
under fluorescent lights sometimes has a greenish cast.
Use Shadow Highlight when your image is well-exposed except for the shadowy
areas. This effect brightens the shadows to reveal more detail, as shown in
Figure 7-8.
Tip: Experiment with the “Auto” effects. Often, they’ll give you the quick fix your clips need; but, double-
check what they’ve done. Computers don’t always see things the same as humans. Premiere may change
something you don’t want changed or it may be too heavy-handed in “fixing” your image.
Edit Auto Color-Correction
If you’re ready to wade a little deeper into the color-correction pool, you can fine-
tune the color-correction effects that appear under the Adjust menu.
The fact that an effect has the word “auto” in its name, like Auto Color or Auto
Contrast, doesn’t mean you can’t edit it. In fact, you can edit auto effects just as
you would any other. (And yes, it’s ironic that you’re fine-tuning an “auto” effect.)

In the Effects secondary drop-down menu, choose “Adjust” and apply Auto Con-

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Color-Correct an

Some of the effects in the Adjust group share the same settings and tools. If you
understand how the settings work for Auto Color (Figure 7-9), you can apply that
understanding to edit the other effects, too. Here are some of the common set-
tings that need interpretation:
• Temporal Smoothing prevents effects from making abrupt changes from one
frame to the next. When you color-correct a video clip, you change multiple
images. After all, every frame is a separate image. When you apply an effect, such
as Auto Color, Premiere analyzes the frame designated by the playhead. In some
cases analyzing a single frame works just fine. Other times, you’d like Auto Color
to examine some of the adjacent frames, too. If Temporal Smoothing is set to 0.00,
Premiere analyzes a single frame. If you set Temporal Smoothing to 2.00, Pre-
miere analyzes all the frames 2 seconds prior to the current frame.
• Black Clip limits how much Premiere applies the effect to the shadowy areas in
your image. Larger values add more contrast.
• White Clip limits how much Premiere applies the effect to the highlights in
your image. Larger values add more contrast.
• Snap Neutral Midtones fixes an image that has color problems, if it’s too green
or too red for example. Behind the scenes, Premiere identifies a color as middle
gray and then adjusts the other colors accordingly.
• Blend With Original cranks up or turns down the intensity of an effect. Imag-
ine that your original image is on a lightbox and the color-corrected image is a
transparency. If you place the transparency over the original image, you see a
composite of the original and the corrected images—part of the original shows
through as does part of the corrected image. Adjusting the Blend With Original
setting is like adjusting the influence of the original image—the higher the
number, the more the original image shows through. Set Blend With Original
to 100 percent, and the transparency has no effect at all.
Fix Shaky Video
Unless you use a tripod all the time, chances are you’ve got some shaky video in
your media panel. Yes, some successful filmmakers use shaky video to great effect
(witness The Blair Witch Project), but most of the time a shaky image screams “ama-
teur filmmaker” to a seasick audience. Many camcorders have built-in stabilizers,
which help minimize the problem.
If, after you import clips into Premiere, you see some shakiness, you can use Pre-
miere’s Stabilizer effect. It analyzes an image and identifies its subject. Then it
shifts the individual frames in an attempt to keep the subject centered and moving
smoothly. To make the process work, the effect zooms in on your image a bit, so
that the Stabilizer effect has some room to play with as it tries to keep the subject
centered.

Chapter 7: Add Effects and Themes
211
Color-Correct an
Image
As you might expect, the results are sometimes pretty good and sometimes not so
good. If you’ve got shaky video that you need to use, it’s worth a try. Go to
Window ➝Effects and choose Video Effects from the drop-down menu, and then
choose Video Stabilizer in the secondary menu. Drag Stablizer onto your shaky
clip and then press Enter to preview it.
Select your clip and then click the Properties button to examine the Stabilizer set-
tings. There are a couple:
Use the Smoothing slider to increase or decrease how much stabilizing Premiere
applies to the clip. When you have scenes with intentional camera movement, you
need to experiment with this setting. If Premiere cranks smoothing up too high, it
can remove movement you want in the clip.

212
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Apply an Audio
Effect
The Zoom slider controls how much the Stabilizer zooms in on your image. If
you’re correcting a very shaky image, the Stabilizer will need to zoom in quite a bit.
If it doesn’t zoom in enough to compensate for the shifting subject, you end up
with no picture in part of the frame.
Click the checkbox labeled “Background—Use Original” to fill in the parts of the
frame left empty when Stabilizer zooms in on the subject. Whether or not this
works well depends on the subject and how much shaking’s going on.
Use the Correction-Limit to Zoom check box to ensure that the Stabilizer leaves
no empty space in the frame. This may result in a shakier image.
Apply an Audio Effect
You apply audio effects the same way you do video effects—by dragging the effect
to the timeline. But this time, make sure you add the effect to your project’s audio
track, not the video track you’ve been working with until now.
Premiere automatically adds two audio fixed effects to every clip: Volume and Bal-
ance. These work pretty much the way they do on your home music system. In
addition to a slider control, Volume has two buttons (Fade In and Fade Out) that
you can click to fade the volume in and out at the ends of a clip.
Premiere’s standard audio effects—the ones you apply yourself—work primarily as
filters, letting you remove or enhance sound at certain frequencies. From the Edit
panel, choose Audio Effects in the first pull-down menu and Show All in the second.
The effects include the DeNoiser, which does just what you think it does—removes
static from clips. Reverb creates an echo-like effect. PitchShifter helps you to make
low-pitched tones sound like high-pitched tones and vice-versa. Maybe you could
make Bob Dylan sing like Alison Krauss.
If you want to preview a clip’s audio without viewing its video, click the “Play only
the audio for this clip” button. Next to that button, another button lets you loop
the audio—play it over and over until you stop it.
Famous Movie Moment: In Francis Ford Coppola’s film The Conversation, Walter Murch, the sound
editor, used a number of audio effects to distort the surreptitious recordings made by Harry Caul (Gene
Hackman) and his crew. Bit by bit, the recordings became more understandable and the secret twist of the
film was revealed.
Edit Effects in the Timeline
You don’t have to travel to the Properties panel to make small changes to an effect
applied to a clip. Remember that a yellow line running horizontally through your
clips represents the setting for a specific effect. How do you know which effect it rep-
resents? The answer is in a mini-menu attached to each clip. Look to the right of a

video or audio clip’s name, and you see a small triangle indicating there’s a menu
hidden there. Click on the triangle, and you see the drop-down menu. The menu for
a video clip includes its fixed effects (Motion, Image, and Opacity, as shown in
Figure 7-10), and the names of any effects you added to it. In a sound clip, you see
Volume and Balance, along with the name of any audio effect you added.
Each effect has a submenu where you see the properties for that effect (they’re the
same properties you’d see in the clip’s Properties panel). For example, the Motion
effect includes properties such as Position, Scale, and Rotate. Click a property on the
submenu, such as Scale, and the yellow graph line in the clip changes to represent the
setting for that property. A check mark appears beside the graphed property, Scale in
this case. To edit the property once you select it, drag the graph line. As you do, you
can see that the scale of the clip changes in the monitor panel (Figure 7-11). Just
make sure the playhead is over the clip, or you won’t see the changes.

Apply an Effect Preset
If you followed the exercises in this chapter so far, you can see that some effects are
complicated and you can spend a lot of time tweaking the settings. Fortunately,
you don’t have to. Premiere includes presets—a bunch of effects already tuned up
to perform specific tasks. For example, there are picture-in-picture effects designed
to shrink a clip and then position it on the screen—great when you want to place
multiple images over a background image, à la news shows that tap three experts
simultaneously. Other presets create drop shadows and beveled edges. Some pre-
sets zoom in on an image and pan across it—an action sometimes called the Ken
Burns effect, after the popular documentary filmmaker.
To find Premiere’s preset effects, open the Effects panel (Window ➝Effects) and
choose Presets from the menu in the upper-left corner. You can use the secondary
menu to choose a category of presets or you can use the search box if you know a
preset’s name. You apply a preset the same way you apply any effect—drag it to a
clip in the timeline.
Presets are nothing more than your run-of-the-mill effects with their characteris-
tics already set and a new name. That means that after you apply a preset, you can
go into the clip’s Properties panel and tweak the settings. Preset effects give you a
head start if they’re even close to the effect you want.
The only trick is to know which fixed or standard effect the preset uses—and that’s
not always apparent by the name. Often, if you click the Properties button or
choose Window ➝Properties immediately after you apply a preset, you see the
effect properties selected and open. Otherwise, refer to the list below for the name
of the effect.
Table 7-1 describes some of the presets Premiere provides.

Bevel Edges
Bevel Edges
Standard
These effects alter the edges of an image,
giving it a 3D feel. You can choose thick or
thin edges. You can apply this effect to
any clip in your movie, but it works best
for a clip that’s superimposed on another
image and scaled down so it doesn’t fill
the entire frame. Consider using one of
these effects when you apply a picture-
in-picture effect.

Blurs
Fast Blur
Standard
These effects are a bit like transitions
because they affect the ends of your clips.
For example, Blur In looks a little like you
started rolling film before you focused on
the subject (filmmakers refer to this effect
as “racking focus”). When you want
something more dramatic than a simple
dissolve or fade-in, this is a tasteful
option.
Color Effects
Tint
Standard
These presets change the hue of a clip or
image. For the most part, they make very
dramatic color shifts. In most cases, you
wouldn’t want to use an effect like Hyper-
Tint Blue/Green on your entire image for
a long period of time. On the other hand,
you could use it to simplify a background
clip if you place multiple images on top
of it.
Drop Shadows
Drop Shadow
Standard
Similar to the bevel effects, Drop Shad-
ows works best when you place one
image on top of another. The shadow
makes it appear as if one image is floating
over another.
Horizontal
Image Pans
Motion
Fixed
Makes an entire video clip or still image
move horizontally across the screen. L-R
means the image moves from the left to
the right. Each preset has a dimension,
such as 640 × 480 or 2048 × 1536, that
defines how much of your image is used
in the effect. So, if the frame size of your
image is 1280 × 720, then the 640 × 480
setting crops your image. This is handy if
you don’t want the edges of the image to
appear during the pan.
Horizontal
Image Zooms
Motion
Fixed
Zooms in and out of an image. The
dimensions work as they do with a pan. If
you use an effect with smaller dimen-
sions, you’re less likely to see the edges of
the clip’s frame on the screen.
Mosaics
Mosaic
Standard
The mosaic effects break an image into lit-
tle chunks, giving it a blocky appearance.
This is another one of those effects that
are applied to either the beginning
(Mosaic In) or the end (Mosaic Out)
of a clip.

effect. If you haven’t done anything since you applied the preset except preview it,
click Undo or press Ctrl+Z to undo it. If you used other commands in the interim,
you’re in for a little more work. If the preset uses a standard effect like Drop
Shadow or Tint, right-click the clip and then choose Properties from the shortcut
PIPs
Motion
Fixed
There are quite a few different PIP
(picture-in-picture) presets and they
come in quite handy when you want to
place smaller images over a background.
These presets change the settings for the
Motion fixed effect, like Position, Scale,
and Anchor Point. You could spend a lot
of time tweaking PIPs to come up when
an effect setting such as PIP 25% LL Scale
In. Perhaps a little decoding is in order.
You already know PIP stands for picture-
in-picture. “25%” means that Premiere
reduces the overlay image to 25 percent
of its original size. “LL” means the image
will be in the lower left corner of the
frame. “Scale In” means that at the begin-
ning of the clip, the image starts very tiny
and grows to be 25% of its original size.
“Scale Out” means that the image shrinks
at the end of the clip.

This dramatic effect makes your image

Save Your Custom Effects as Presets
If you use a lot of effects in your videos, chances are you’ve got some favorites.
You’ll be happy to know that after you fine-tune an effect, you can save it for reuse
and apply it just as you would any other effect.
There are plenty of reasons why you’d want to save a customized effect. For exam-
ple, applying a certain effect throughout your movie gives it a certain continuity.
Even if an effect corrects a technical issue, like color or exposure problems, you
may want to make it a favorite.
To keep a custom effect, you save it as a preset. Your saved effects end up in the
My Presets panel (Figure 7-12).
Tip: Premiere gives you a lot of effects to choose from. If you want to cut through the clutter, there are
two effects folders where you choose the contents. When you save a custom effect, it shows up in your
My Presets panel. Go to Window ➝Effects and choose My Presets from the menu. There’s another item
on that menu called Favorites. You can store any effect here, whether you customized it or not. In the
Effects view, just right-click on an effect and choose Add to Favorites.

Apply an Effect
Preset
As with any preset, your own preset starts with either a fixed or standard effect.
Once you customize an effect, you can go to the clip’s Properties panel and save
the effect as a preset. Here are the steps involved:
1. Apply one of the standard effects, like Lens Distortion, to a clip in the timeline.
If you’re creating a preset from one of the fixed effects described on page 197,
you can skip this step. Premiere automatically applies fixed effects to every clip,
so they always appear in a clip’s Properties panel.
2. With your clip selected, choose Window ➝ Properties.
All the effects applied to the clip appear in the Properties panel.
3. Customize the effect.
Fine-tune the settings in the effect. If you don’t see the settings, click the triangle
button to expand the effect’s menu. Each effect uses different settings to create
its magic. There are more details on customizing effects on page 200.
4. In the Properties panel, right-click the effect name and choose “Save Preset”.
The Save Preset window opens (Figure 7-13).
5. Type in a name and description for your Preset.
Give your preset a good descriptive name that you’ll understand three years
from now. For an example of a descriptive name, see the paragraph on PIP pre-
sets on page 216. You don’t have to fill in the description box, but you may
appreciate additional detail later on when you’re trying to figure out how your
preset works.
6. Choose how Premiere should apply the preset to clips. The choices are Scale,
Anchor To In Point, and Anchor to Out Point.
You can apply a preset to the beginning of a clip, the end of a clip, or propor-
tionately throughout a clip. Remember, when you create a preset, you want it to
be versatile enough so you can use it on different clips. Effects anchored to the
beginning or end of a clip are similar to transitions. Premiere’s Blur presets are
good examples of anchored effects.
7. Click OK.
Premiere saves your preset in the My Presets panel.
Once you create a preset, you can apply it to any clip in your timeline by dragging
it from the My Presets view onto a clip. If you really, really like to keep all your
tools in one spot, you can add your presets to your Favorites panel. Right click on a
preset and choose Add to Favorites from the shortcut menu.

Use a Third-Party Effect
If you don’t find the special effect you need in Premiere’s Effects panel, you can
hunt down effects from companies other than Adobe. Lots of them develop effects
packages as plug-ins for Adobe’s professional video-editing program, Premiere
CS4, and many of them work in Premiere Elements as well. In some cases you may
suffer a little sticker shock. Professional plug-ins often cost more than the Pre-
miere Elements program itself.
Premiere loads plug-ins whenever you launch the program, and they work as
though they were a part of Premiere all along.
You can find audio plug-ins as well as video plug-ins. For example, there’s a popu-
lar plug-in standard for audio programs called VST (Virtual Studio Technology)
that works with Premiere.
Here are some places to start your hunt for effects plug-ins:
• ABsoft (www.neatvideo.com) publishes a video noise-reduction plug-in.
• Boris FX (www.borisfx.com) develops professional graphics effects plug-ins.
• Red Giant Software (www.redgiantsoftware.com) publishes tools that give video
a stylized look.
• SyntheticAperture (www.synthetic-ap.com) publishes video plug-ins and other
tools of interest to filmmakers.
• Bias (www.bias-inc.com) offers several audio products, including audio noise-
reduction tools.
• Voxengo (www.voxengo.com) offers a variety of VST audio plug-ins.

Timeline Special Effects
Some special effects don’t require a trip to Premiere’s Effects panel. Want to make
a car move backward? Or make clouds rush across the sky? Perhaps you want to
show a basketball player’s perfect move in slow motion. You can do all these things
using Premiere’s Time Stretch command (Figure 7-14). If you want to freeze the
action entirely, you can do that using the Freeze Frame button at the bottom of the
monitor.
Play Your Movie Backward
It’s easy to make any clip play in reverse. All you need is the modestly named Time
Stretch tool (Figure 7-15). When you explore Time Stretch, you’ll see that it does a
lot more than its name implies. You can open this handy tool several ways:
• Select a clip and then press Ctrl+R.
• Select a clip and then click the Time Stretch button above the timeline (it looks
like a clock).
• Right-click a clip in the timeline and then choose Time Stretch from the short-
cut menu.
• Select a clip and then choose Clip ➝ Time Stretch.
The tiny Time Stretch panel provides a few settings, some of which may seem a lit-
tle puzzling at first. For example, there’s a checkbox labeled Reverse Speed. Click it
and preview your clip—the entire clip plays in reverse. In fact, Adobe could have
called the command Reverse Frames, because that’s just what it does—it reverses
the order of the frames when you play back a clip. With some clips, the effect is
hardly noticeable; for example, flowers blowing in the wind. For others, ones with
people or cars moving, for example, the change is pretty dramatic.

You can use Reverse Speed along with some of Time Stretch’s other tricks for
unique effects. For example, if you want to show your basketball star perform a
real reverse dunk in slow-mo, you’ve got the tools to do it.
Change the Speed of Playback
Again using the Time Stretch tool (Figure 7-14), you can make a clip run faster or
slower. Click the Time Stretch button, and your cursor changes to the time stretch
cursor. With this handy time-bending device, you can drag the end of a clip to the
right, creating a slow motion effect. Or you can drag the end to the left, creating a
fast-motion effect. If you want to do the same thing with a little more precision,
follow these steps:
1. Select a clip in the timeline and then press Ctrl+R.
The Time Stretch panel opens. The two top settings are Speed (shown as a per-
centage) and Duration (shown as time).
2. Click on the number next to Speed and type in “400”.
When you change a clip’s speed, its duration automatically changes to accom-
modate that change. Use numbers over 100 percent to speed up a clip and numbers
below 100 percent to slow it down.
Figure 7-15:
The Time Stretch panel puts you in
control of dramatic special effects
such as slow motion, fast motion,
and reverse motion.

3. Click OK and preview your movie.
A speed increase of 400 percent is, with the right footage, pretty dramatic. If you
have people in your clip, they’ll take on Charlie Chaplin-esque movement. Use
slow motion and your characters look like they’re in one of Sam Peckinpah’s
films from the ’70s—bullets and blood optional.
If people are talking in a clip you speed up, the pitch of their voices changes to
something like that of Alvin the chipmunk. Too fast, like 400 percent in the previ-
ous example, and you may not be able to understand them at all. If you want to
speed up a clip and keep the words intelligible, try speeds between 130 and 200
percent. If you want to speed up a clip beyond that and get rid of the resulting
chipmunk voice, check the Maintain Audio Pitch box in the Time Stretch panel
(Figure 7-15). The pitch of the voices sounds better, but overall the sound may
remind you of a bad wiretap from a cop show.
When you go in the other direction and slow down a clip, similar audio aberra-
tions occur. Without the Maintain Audio Pitch box checked, people’s voices get
very low. When you check the box, the pitch sounds fine. In fact, the audio is
much more intelligible than it was when you speeded up a clip. That’s because
you’re not losing any audio data, you’re actually repeating it. The overall effect is
that people speak very, very slowly.
Another way to control the speed of a clip is to change its duration. As usual, Pre-
miere displays time in timecode format, hours;minutes;seconds;frames. Type in
“20;00” if you want a clip 20 seconds in length (Premiere automatically fills in the
other numbers), or “1;20;00” if you want a clip of 1 minute and 20 seconds.
Changing a clip’s duration automatically changes it speed, unless you unlink the
two. To do so, click on the Link icon in the Time Stretch window and the icon
changes to a broken link. When you break the link between Speed and Duration,
Time Stretch doesn’t really produce a time-bending effect. Instead, it’s an alterna-
tive way to trim a clip. That’s because, when you change a clip’s duration with the
Speed and Duration settings unlinked, Premiere adds or removes frames from the
end of the clip.
Add a Freeze Frame
Freeze frames are a dramatic form of punctuation in video. Perhaps you’d like to
freeze the “You may now kiss the bride” moment at a wedding and then slowly
dissolve to the couple’s walk back down the aisle. In most cases, you want to insert
your freeze frame for what playwrights call a dramatic pause. Here are the steps to
add a freeze frame to your movie:
1. Place the playhead on the image you want to freeze
The image in the monitor is the one you’ll ice.

Chapter 7: Add Effects and Themes
223
Timeline Special
Effects
2. In the lower corner of the monitor, click the Freeze Frame button (it looks like
a camera, as shown in Figure 7-16).
The Freeze Frame panel opens. At the top, you control the Freeze Frame Duration
setting via a number box. Unless you’ve made changes to Premiere’s prefer-
ences, the duration is automatically set to 5 seconds.
3. Click the number 5 and type in a new duration.
You can also click and drag the number to scrub in a new one.
4. (Optional) Check the box “Edit in Photoshop Elements after inserting”.
Use this option to edit the image in Photoshop. Perhaps you’d like to tweak the
color, add a special effect, or a title.
5. Click Insert in Movie.
Premiere inserts the freeze frame image into your movie as a video clip and
adds the single frame to your media catalog as a still image. As with all still
images, there’s no audio track. Unless the freeze frame was at the end of a clip,
Premiere splits the source clip in the timeline into two parts, with the freeze
frame clip in the middle.
If you checked the “Edit in Photoshop Elements” box, that program starts up
and opens the still image for a little photo magic.
Figure 7-16:

Effects
If you want to change the duration of a freeze frame after you insert it in your
timeline, use the Select tool (V) to drag the end of the clip to trim it as you would
any other video clip. To use the freeze frame elsewhere in your movie, drag it from
the Media view (Organize tab ➝ Media).
Famous Movie Moment: In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the last moment of the movie uses
a freeze frame. Paul Newman and Robert Redford race through a doorway, greeted by a hail of gunfire.
The frame freezes on their running figures before the bullets arrive. The legends are frozen in time—a
much better ending than seeing the aftermath.
Change a Clip’s Frame Size
Want to place a clip in a small window over another clip? It’s a popular effect for
music videos and fast-moving TV shows like 24. The easiest way to achieve this
effect is to use one of the PIP (picture-in-picture) presets described on page 216. If
the preset sizes don’t work for you, you can always create your own PIP effect.
1. Place two video clips on the timeline, one above the other.
For example, put your background clip in the Video 1 track and the clip des-
tined for the small window in Video 2. In Premiere, the clip in the top track
always hides the clip below. As for audio, you’ll hear both tracks in equal vol-
ume. You can adjust this using the Audio Mixer (Window ➝Audio Mixer). See
page 309 for details.
2. Click on the image in the monitor.
When you select the image, you see a border around the clip and handles on the
edges and corners.
3. Drag any of the handles to resize the clip.
As you drag a handle, the clip changes size but keeps its relative proportions.
4. Drag the image to position it on the screen.
Click anywhere within the image (but away from the border) to select it so you
can drag it around the screen.
5. Render the effect and play it back.
Tip: If you want, you can place the image partially outside the frame of your movie. When you render
the movie, Premiere lops off the part that’s out of frame.
If you want to make additional changes to your PIP clip, you need to open the
Properties panel and edit the Motion settings. Select the clip and then click
the Properties button above the timeline, or choose Window ➝Properties. Click
the triangle button next to the name Motion to open the panel, where you see the

Transparency
settings shown in Figure 7-17, which, because you altered the clip’s default size and
position, now include settings for scale and position. With these additional set-
tings, you can change the width and height of the clip independently. Just remove
the check mark in the Uniform Scale box and then make adjustments to the Scale
and Scale Width sliders. Use the Rotate buttons to spin your clip around.
Tip: Want to move your PIP window around the screen? See the chapter on effects and keyframes, page 261.
Adventures in Transparency
Every clip you add to the sceneline or timeline starts off 100 percent opaque—at its
full exposure, with no transparency. So if you add a clip to the Video 2 track, it
hides the clip on Video 1. If you want to make parts of the clip underneath visible,
you have to resize the top clip (see page 224) or make parts of it transparent.
Premiere gives you several ways to change the transparency of a clip. When you
understand how the different techniques work, you can choose the right method
for the job at hand. For example, you can:
• Change an entire clip’s transparency. It’s easy to make an entire clip semitrans-
parent. If the semitransparent clip sits over another clip in the timeline, you see
both images simultaneously, like a double exposure.
• Cut a whole in the top image to reveal part of the bottom image. Using a mask
or a matte, you can tell Premiere to make a certain region in the top clip trans-
parent. For example, you can snip a heart shape out of the top image, and you
have the effect shown later in Figure 7-18.
Figure 7-17:
The tools to create a
good picture-in-picture
effect are tucked in the
Motion effect panel.
Using these settings you
can change the size,
position, and rotation of
any clip in your timeline.

226
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Adventures in
Transparency
• Make a certain color transparent in the top image to reveal part of the bottom
image. This works great for a constantly moving image, like the classic example:
the meteorologist standing in front of a weather map as an animated storm sys-
tem moves across the screen. The weather person is standing in front of a blue
background—that’s the top image. The weather map is the bottom image. By
electronically removing the blue background from the image that has the meteor-
ologist in it, you see the moving weather map underneath.
Change a Clip’s Transparency
The main reason to make a scene semitransparent is to superimpose one video clip
over another. Usually, you leave the underlying clip set to an opacity of 100 percent
and you put the other clip above it and make it partially opaque.
1. Place a clip in the Video 1 track.
The video track at the bottom of the timeline has the name Video 1 (unless you
renamed it).
2. Place a second clip in the Video 2 track as shown in Figure 7-19.
The new clip hides the clip in Video 1 because it’s 100 percent opaque. You
need to change this clip’s opacity or size so that the first clip shows through.
3. Click the Properties button above the timeline.
The Properties panel shows the clip’s fixed effects: Image Control, Motion, and
Opacity.
4. Click the triangle button to open the Opacity settings and then drag the Clip
Opacity slider to 50%.
Once you adjust the Opacity, the image from the Video 1 track shows through.
Experiment a little to find just the right degree of opacity for the effect you
want. The sweet spot varies depending on the complexity of the images and
their relative brightness and contrast.
There are many ways to use transparency as a special effect. You can use it with
moving video or still images. In some cases, you may want to remove the back-
ground of an image. Suppose your film has a young man wandering the city
haunted by the memory of his lost love. You could use a transparent close-up of
his loved one filling the frame as the underlying image shows his travels through
the streets.
Transparency is one effect that requires a hefty amount of video-processing muscle.
You may need to render the effect to see a smooth preview (see page 173). If you
render manually, drag the center of the work area bar over your effect as shown in
Figure 7-19. Drag the ends of the bar to match the area you want rendered and
then press the enter key. There’s more on rendering on page 173.

Transparency
Famous Movie Moment: In Raiders of the Lost Ark, the original Indiana Jones movie, Steven Spiel-
berg superimposes the image of a map and an airplane. The map shows the globetrotting journey and
sets the audience up for the next adventure. The effect adds to the sense of the period (the 1930s) and is
an homage to earlier films that used the same visual shorthand.
Make Part of a Clip Transparent
Sometimes you want to show two clips on the screen at the same time, but you
don’t want either image to be semitransparent. If you just want a rectangular picture-
in-picture effect, you can use one PIP presets (page 216) or the manual PIP tech-
nique described on page 261. But if you want to put a dancing wedding couple in a
heart-shaped frame with a background image that shows the gardens where they
were married, read on. The method discussed here works best for non-rectangular
shapes, such as flowers, stars, or hearts. Most of the time, you don’t want to use an
overly complex shape with lots of corners and edges.
To get started, you need a couple of video clips and a still image to serve as a mask.
Your mask should be a single opaque shape, such as a white heart on a black back-
ground. Follow these steps to apply what the pros call a “mask” effect:
1. Place a clip in the Video 1 track.
2. Place a second clip in the Video 2 track.
The new clip hides the clip in the Video 1 track because it’s 100 percent opaque.

3. Place the mask image in the Video 3 track.
At this point, the mask image obscures the clips on the other two tracks.
Tip: You can find some black-and-white art in Premiere—click the Edit tab and then click the Clip Art but-
ton. If you’re adventurous and have a photo-editing program like Photoshop Elements, you can cut some
the colored part out of some of the other Clip Art shapes to create masks. Also, if you have Photoshop Ele-
ments installed, you’ll find some more black and white shapes by clicking the Cookie Cutter tool (Q) on
the toolbar.
4. Choose Window ➝ Effects.
The Effects panel opens.
5. Choose “Video Effects” in the menu and “Keying” in the secondary menu.
The Effects view displays a variety of Keying effects, like Blue Screen Key,
Chroma Key, and Track Matte Key.
6. Drag Track Matte Key onto the clip in the Video 2 track.
You want to apply the matte effect to the clip that will appear over the background.
7. Click the Properties button.
The Track Matte Key effect shows up in the clip Properties panel.
8. Set the Matte menu to Video 3 and set the Composite Using menu to Matte
Luma.
The matted image appears on the screen and the image in Video 1 shows as the
background. Why use Matt Luma? Premiere uses the clip’s luminance, or relative
brightness, to identify the transparent areas. You could use this same technique
with a photo that has very bright and very dark areas.
Tip: If you want to reverse the role of clips used in one of the Matte effects, open the clip Properties and
the effect. Then, check the Reverse box in the matte properties.
Superimpose Part of a Clip Over Another Clip
The snazziest transparency trick of all is where you place one moving image over
another. For example, if you’ve got some spare footage of Neil Armstrong’s stroll
on the moon, you could add an image of your best friend walking alongside him.
This video trick goes by a few different names. You may hear people talk about
green-screening or blue-screening. Or perhaps they’ll call it blue-keying.

230
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Adventures in
Transparency
Whatever name you use, here’s how it works: For the moonwalk, film your friend
walking around in front of an all-blue or all-green background (just make sure his
clothes don’t have the same color as the background, or part of him will disappear
when you apply the effect). Then you assemble your timeline as you did in the two
previous exercises. Put the background moon footage on the Video 1, or the bottom-
most track. Put your friend, walking in front of the blue screen on the track above
the background. Then, use the Blue Screen Key effect to tell Premiere to make any-
thing that’s blue in the top image transparent. When the blue background disap-
pears, your friend walks on the moon with Armstrong. The Green Screen Key
works the same way, except it makes anything green transparent.
The Chroma Key effect uses the brightness or luminance to create a mask.
VideoMerge is an effect that automatically does a lot of the work of a Chroma Key.
It even automatically selects the color Premiere removes. Sometimes, when you
add a clip to the timeline above another clip, you see a dialog box asking if you
want to use the VideoMerge effect. Answer yes and VideoMerge attempts to do all
the work for you. If you don’t get the results you want, open the clip Properties as
shown in Figure 7-20, and make adjustments by manually selecting a color and set-
ting the tolerance.
If you want to VideoMerge two images and Premiere doesn’t show a dialog box
when you add a clip to the second track, just apply VideoMerge as you would any
effect. Go to Window ➝Effects and drag the VideoMerge effect on top of the sec-
ond image.
Figure 7-20:
The VideoMerge effect is
designed to be as automatic
as possible. However, if you
don’t get exactly what you
want, you can always open
the clip Properties panel and
tweak the VideoMerge
settings.

Premiere Elements’

Premiere Elements’ Themes
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Premiere comes with a selection of prepackaged visuals
(titles and transitions, for example) and background music that you can apply to
your movie. These themes, as they’re called, give you an easy way to apply profes-
sionally designed components to your project.
When it comes to Premiere’s themes, you either love ’em or hate ’em. They can be
a bit on the corny side and if you like to micro-manage your video projects, you’re
probably in the “hate ’em” camp. On the other hand, if you want to take the fast
and easy track to videos that come complete with titles, transitions, special effects,
and menus, you may be interested. Adobe has developed themes based on com-
mon types of video projects, like road trips, birthdays, and holidays. Premiere’s
InstantMovie feature (described on page 28) uses themes as a cornerstone of the
movies it creates.
Tip: Confused trying to figure out where Themes end and InstantMovie begins? You’re not the only one.
As Premiere has evolved, these features have become intertwined; in fact, they tap the same reservoir of
preformatted titles and graphics, soun clips, video effects, and transitions. The real difference is in the way
you select one or the other. When you click Themes, Premiere uses all the clips currently in the timeline or
sceneline in your themed movie. When you click InstantMovie, Premiere asks which of the clips in the
Media panel you want to include, and then it moves on to the Themes panel; from that point forward, the
two features work exactly the same.
Here are some of the elements that themes automatically add to your movie:
• Preformatted opening and closing titles and graphics. You get to type in your
own words, but Premiere provides the graphics and formats the type, as shown
in Figure 7-22. Many of the themes use animation to zoom the type in and off
the screen.
• Royalty-free music. Themes come with music. It may not be the latest pop
song, but you don’t have to pay for it.
• Automated effects and transitions. Most themes combine PIP (picture-in-
picture) effects with motion- and clipart-style backgrounds.
• Automatic editing. When you use themes along with InstantMovie, Premiere
analyzes your footage and makes decisions about what parts to use and what
parts to leave out. InstantMovie can also choose the order of the clips. You get
to choose whether you want the movie to run the same length as the music or
whether you want to repeat or trim the music to match the movie.
Stock Themes
Premiere themes come in categories such as Style and Events (Figure 7-22). The
Style themes, for example, are based on seasons and activities such as a school
yearbook. Event themes focus on holidays and family events such as birthdays and
weddings.

Themes
Here are some examples of what you find in the themes collection.
• Outdoor Wedding has background images with gardens and flowers. Slow
zooms are applied to the clips and the music has a nice, solemn feeling to it—
Pachelbel Canon in D.
• Road Trip uses a map as the background, along with street-sign clipart. The
soundtrack includes car engine sounds and slashing guitar riffs. See Figure 7-22.
• Slideshow Pan and Zoom, as you might guess, is designed to work with still
images and uses motion guided by Premiere’s ability to guess the points of
interest in your movie. The background audio has a world music kind of sound
with woodblock percussion, thumb-organ harmonies, and flute melody.
• Comic Book has colorful graphics and “KAPOW!” and “WHACK!” title callouts,
along with lots of synthesizer music with a strong drum beat.
• Extreme Sports gives you fast-changing effects with a variety of background
stills. Premiere edits your clips using scale, zoom, and pan effects. The music
includes lots of rock-and-roll power chords.
• Fairytale has an old-fashioned feeling with book pages flipping, lots of calli-
graphic type, and dreamy harp music.
• Fun brings a strong ’50s/’60s rock drumbeat to your clips and uses the timing to
add transitions and zoom effects.
• Grid adds a techy feel to your movie. Lots of grid lines in the graphics and it
uses the mosaic effect to break your clips into blocky elements. The back-
ground music is a synthesized orchestra.
• Kid’s Channel is designed to look like a children’s television program. Cartoonish
graphics, sound effects, and kind of snappy music.
• Music Video puts your movie to the beat of rock-and-roll. Graphics include
lots of effects, clipart of stereo speakers, and other musical icons.
• Secret Agent lets you turn your stars into James Bond. The background music
and sound effects give you the impression something exciting and dangerous is
about to happen. Graphic images include crosshairs, surveillance maps, and
plans for something that a spy might want to get their hands on.
Adobe continues to develop themes, so you’re likely to see new ones as time goes
on. Some themes are only available when you opt for a premium Photoshop.com
account.
Apply a Theme
Themes are tied to Premiere’s InstantMovie tools. So when you apply a theme, you
take advantage of tools like the Auto-Analyzer, Auto Edit, and many other settings
that automate video editing. You’d think that themes and InstantMovie would be
an all-or-nothing proposition for your movies, but that’s not really the case. Pre-
miere lets you choose which theme elements it uses in your movie and gives you

234
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Premiere Elements’
Themes
some options to fine-tune those features (Figure 7-23). That way, after you pre-
view your movie with the theme applied, you can go ahead and make additional
edits as you would with a movie you assembled from scratch.
The first important decision you need to make is whether you want to apply a theme
and the InstantMovie magic to an entire movie or just to clips you select before you
choose the theme. If don’t select any clips, and there are no clips in the timeline, Pre-
miere chooses clips from your project and adds them to the timeline. If you already
have clips in the timeline, Premiere uses those. Otherwise, you can tell Premiere
which clips to use by Shift-clicking or Ctrl-clicking the clips in either the timeline or
the Media panel.
• Add text for your titles. Premiere provides the text boxes for the opening and
closing titles. Click in a box and type away. Use Ctrl+Enter to add new lines.
Each theme handles titling a little differently. In some cases, your titles may
scroll up the screen, in others they may zoom in and out.
• Choose “Auto” edit options for your movie. These options are key to the way
Premiere assembles your clips in a movie and how long it takes Premiere to
build that movie. Click Auto Edit and Auto-Analyzer if you want Premiere to
decide which bits of clips to use. You can choose to apply the theme to your
entire movie or to just clips you select in the sceneline or timeline (Shift-click to
select multiple clips).
• Use theme music or choose your own. Premiere gives you stock music and
sound effects to match each theme, but you’re not limited to those. You can
choose your own music by clicking the Browse button, or you can choose to
have no music at all. Use the slider to set the balance between the soundtrack
music and the audio on your clips. Check the Smart Mix button and Premiere
automatically drops the volume of the music when it identifies voices or other
sounds in your video clips.
• Set the speed and intensity for your movie. Movie editing is all about timing.
Certain subjects, like sports, deserve fast cutting and lots of movement and spe-
cial effects. Other subjects, such as weddings, deserve a slower, more romantic
sense of timing. Premiere’s themes do a pretty good job of setting the beat, but
you can use the sliders in the Speed and Intensity panel to fine-tune these set-
tings. Sliders give you control over the use of effects and the speed of the cutting.
Faster cuts means your clips are chopped into shorter pieces with fewer frames.
• Set the duration for your movie. Another timing aspect of your movie is the
runtime, or duration. What’s most important—the soundtrack music or your
video clips? Often, you want the movie to run just as long as the background
music, usually around 4 minutes. You can change this to a time of your own
choosing, in which case the music will fade out or repeat. Another radio but-
ton, “Use All Clips”, ensures that Premiere uses all the clips in a project in your
movie. The music is adjusted accordingly.

• Choose a sequence for selecting and assembling clips in the timeline. Even if
you let Premiere choose which clips to use and how to order them, you can still
provide a little guidance. Most themes have their own ideas about how to order
clips. They may look for a long shot at one point and want a closeup of a face at
another. If you want to override the theme order, click the button Time/Date
and Premiere organizes the clips according the clip’s time/date stamp.
• Choose whether or not to render your movie. Depending on the options you’ve
chosen, your movie may include lots of special effects. The best way to preview
your themed movie in all its glory is to let Premiere render the effects, titles, and
other elements first.

Edit a Themed Video
You may have creative differences with your theme or InstantMovie editor. No
problem! You’re still the movie mogul. You can jump in and edit a themed movie
or InstantMovie just as you’d edit any other video.
After Premiere adds all the theme elements to a movie, it places the results on the
timeline as a single grouped clip. If you want to replace clips, change effects, or
otherwise edit your movie, you need to break the single clip back into multiple
clips. Right-click the clip in the timeline and then choose Break Apart Instant-
Movie from the shortcut menu. Once the InstantMovie appears on your timeline
as separate clips, you can select the individual clips and add or remove effects. You
can also replace or rearrange the clips on the timeline.
LOLA’S BIG SPLASH PROJECT
Add Effects to Your Movie
If you’re working on the "Lola’s Big Splash" project as you
go through the chapters in this book, there are two special
effects you can apply at this point.
Add the Zoom Blur effect to the final clip in the movie, then
adjust the Blend With Original setting to get just the right
look. In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to make this
effect change over time.
For the first clip, use the Time Stretch tool to reverse the
way the movie plays. If the camera pan moves from the
house to the street, it implies that Lola and her dog-walker
leave the house, walk down the stairs and then show up on
the street in the next clip.

Create Animated
Effects
When you edit video, the fourth dimension—time—is all-important. You want to
control the pacing of your movies. You want voices in sync with images. Music
should reflect the action on the screen and the mood you want to create. And
effects should occur at just the right moment. In Chapter 7, you learned how to
apply effects to an entire clip, while Chapter 6 focused on transitions (which are
really effects at the beginnings and ends of clips). This chapter explains how to
control the timing of those effects.
Premiere gives you frame-by-frame control over your effects. You’ll learn how to
make effects fade in and fade out at exactly the right moment and how to make
pictures, clipart, and titles move around the screen.
What Is an Animated Effect?
An animated effect is one that changes over time. Consider these two animated
effects:
• You want an object to start out perfectly visible and then to slowly fade away.
• You want a small picture-in-picture window to move around a static background.
Even though these two examples will look very different in your movie, they have
something in common: the tool that Premiere uses to control the effect’s timing.
That tool is called a keyframe, and it’s a type of marker you place in your movie’s
timeline. For example, in the first effect listed above, you want to control the
degree of transparency of an object (Figure 8-1). By adding a keyframe, you tell
Premiere, “At this frame, I want this object to be exactly this transparent.” In the

238
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

Animated Effect?
case of the mini-picture moving over the background, you can specify exactly
where that picture-in-picture window is at a particular moment.
Figure 8-1:
By placing keyframes in your
timeline, you can animate
special effects. Here are three
frames from an Opacity effect.
Top: A keyframe specifies 100
percent opacity.
Middle: Premiere
automatically sets the opacity
for all the frames in between.
The result is a smooth, linear
decrease in the opacity effect.
Bottom: Another keyframe
specifies 35 percent opacity.

Chapter 8: Create Animated Effects
239
Learn Keyframing
If you’ve ever used an animation program such as Adobe Flash, you may already
be familiar with keyframes. Keyframes let you control changes in your movie on a
frame-by-frame basis. But, thanks to technology, you don’t have to fiddle with
every single frame. Premiere does most of the heavy lifting for you. For example,
2 minutes into a clip on the timeline, you can create a keyframe for an effect called
Gaussian Blur that specifies 100 percent opacity (“opacity” refers to how visible an
object is; it’s the opposite of transparency). Then, 4 minutes and 21 frames into the
film, you can create another keyframe that specifies an opacity of 35 percent. Pre-
miere takes care of all the frames in between, with each image a little more ghostly
than the last.
Learn Keyframing
Keyframes are markers you pop into your timeline (or into the mini-timeline in a
clip’s Properties panel). The markers themselves don’t appear when you preview
your movie nor in your final video—they just control the action behind the scenes.
Chapter 7 explained that the yellow line running horizontally through video and
audio clips actually represents the value for an effect’s property. Keyframe values
show up as part of that graph. For example, Figure 8-2 shows the keyframes and
graph line for the opacity effect shown in Figure 8-1.
Don’t be intimidated by all this talk about keyframes and graph lines. The anima-
tion process is easy to understand, and you get instant feedback as you work. This
chapter helps you master all the techniques you need to work with keyframes. Key-
frame tasks include:
• Add keyframes. You can add keyframes at any point in your timeline with the
push of a button. Drag the playhead to a spot in your film and click the Add/
Remove Keyframe button shown in Figure 8-3 (see page 241 for more details).
Figure 8-2:
Figure 8-1 showed an
animated effect where
the opacity of an image
decreased over time.
Here, the timeline’s

• Set effect properties at keyframes (page 246). Keyframes lock in specific prop-
erty and values for the effect paired with them. Some effects have only one
property, while others have several. Using keyframes, you can control those
properties individually.
• Navigate between keyframes (page 246). It’s easy to jump back and forth from
one keyframe to the next using the keyframe navigation buttons (Figure 8-3).
• Copy and paste keyframes (page 247). Once keyframes are in your timeline, you
can copy and paste them as if they were words in a word processing document.
• Move keyframes (page 248). Moving keyframes to a different point in time is a
simple click-and-drag operation.
• Remove keyframes (page 248). Yanking keyframes out of the timeline is a simple
select-and-delete operation.
• Fine-tune or smooth effect animation (page 252). Premiere gives you tools to
adjust the rate of change in your animations. You can make the changes abrupt,
or you can make them ease in and out gradually.
• Move objects around the screen (page 256). When you move objects on the
screen, you use the Motion fixed effect. Set the start and end points for a move
using keyframes, and Premiere handles all the in-between positions.
Learn how to use keyframes in Premiere, and you have a head start should you
learn other programs, like Adobe After Effects or Adobe Flash. The tools and tech-
niques used in the three programs are quite similar. However, keyframes aren’t an
exclusive Adobe feature; nearly any program that animates objects has some form
of keyframing. (To get a larger view of the timeline, find an empty spot on it, right-
click and select Track Size ➝Large. For other tips on getting a better view of your
timeline, see the box on page 245.)
Figure 8-3:
Each track in the timeline has three buttons related to
keyframes. The Add/Remove keyframe button is in the center.

Effect
Use Keyframes to Create Your Own Effect
Ready to animate an effect? Here’s the place to start. Suppose you want to use the
dramatic Find Edges effect on a picture of a flower. When you crank up the effect
to full force, Find Edges makes your video image look like a drawing made with
color markers. As the effect’s name implies, it uses color change to find the edges
in an image. Then it emphasizes the color on the edges and de-emphasizes it in the
middle.
As with many effects, Find Edges has a slider that lets you specify how much the
effect influences the original image. At half strength, it looks as if someone traced
the image edges with a color marker (Figure 8-4). For your flower clip, say you
want to start with a realistic image and then have the Find Edges effect gradually
increase until it reaches full strength. Then, you want to fade it out so that by the
end of the clip, the image is back to normal.
You create this effect by putting three keyframes in the timeline. Using these key-
frames, you set the value for Find Edges’ Blend With Original property.
Add Keyframes to Set Effect Properties
Here are the steps you follow to change the intensity of the Find Edges effect. If
you start with a single, short clip in your timeline, it makes the lesson quicker and
easier:
1. In the Tasks panel, click the Edit tab.
When you first open it, the Edit tab displays all of Premiere’s effects. Use the
two menus near the top of the panel to zero in on the effect you want.
2. Set the first Effects menu to Video Effects and the secondary menu to Stylize.
The panel shows several effects that dramatically change the appearance of an
image, including Alpha Glow, Emboss, Replicate, Strobe Light, and Find Edges.

3. Drag the Find Edges effect onto the video clip in the timeline.
The Find Edges effect immediately changes the image.
4. In the Effects panel, click the Edit Effects button and then click the triangle
button next to the Find Edges effect.
When the Properties panel opens, you see the clip’s fixed effects, along with the
Find Edges effect you just applied. Click the triangle buttons to open the indi-
vidual Effect panels, where you see the properties for each effect. Find Edges has
two properties: Invert (a checkbox) and Blend With Original (a slider).
The Blend With Original property is set to zero, meaning that Premiere isn’t
mixing any of the original image into the effect, so the effect will appear at full
strength for the clip’s duration unless you change this property’s value.
5. In the Properties panel, click the Show Keyframes button (the stopwatch in the
upper right-hand corner).
Clicking the stopwatch button opens and closes the mini-timeline in the Proper-
ties panel, as shown in Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-5:

6. In the mini-timeline, drag the playhead back and forth, and then move it all
the way to the left.
Note that as you move the playhead in the mini-timeline, the playhead in the
main timeline moves, too.
Moving the playhead all the way to the left in the mini-timeline places the play-
head on frame 1 of your clip.
7. Click the Toggle Animation button in the effect’s title panel.
The Toggle Animation button looks like a stopwatch, too (see Figure 8-5)—
what is it with Adobe and stopwatches?
When you toggle animation on, you activate Premiere’s keyframe tools. In fact,
when you toggle animation on for the Find Edges effect, Premiere creates two
keyframes, one for each of the two properties associated with the effect (Invert
and Blend With Original). In addition, each keyframe specifies that property’s
value. Here, Invert is turned off and Blend With Original is set to zero, so the top
keyframe sets the Invert value to deselected, or off (because the checkbox is turned
off), and the bottom keyframe sets the Blend With Original value to zero.
The keyframes appear at frame 1 (to the far left) in the mini-timeline, and they
may be a little hard to see—look for two right-pointing solid arrows (they’re
actually diamonds, Premiere’s shorthand for keyframes, but the edge of the
mini-timeline has cut them in half).
8. Click the Toggle Animation button (a stopwatch yet again) next to Invert and
then click OK in the Warning box.
The warning message explains that when you toggle animation off for a prop-
erty, you remove any keyframes associated with that property. When you click
OK, the keyframe for the Invert property disappears. At this point there’s a single
keyframe in the mini-timeline next to the Blend With Original property, as
shown in Figure 8-6.
9. Drag the Blend With Original slider to 100 percent.
The video image is restored to its original appearance.
10.Drag the playhead to the middle of the clip and then click the Add/Remove
Keyframe button (it’s the diamond-shaped button beside the Blend With Orig-
inal property slider).
Premiere creates a new keyframe for the Blend With Original property with a
property value of 100 percent.

11. Drag the Blend With Original slider back to 0 percent.
As you make the changes in this exercise, the image in the monitor changes, too.
When you change the Blend With Original setting, you automatically create a new
keyframe that stores the new value, and the keyframe appears in the mini-timeline
(now as the full diamond shape). There’s no graph line in the mini-timeline as
there is in the main timeline, so all you see are diamond-shaped keyframes.
12. Drag the playhead all the way to the right in the mini-timeline.
You can also press the End key to move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.
13. Drag the Blend With Original slider to 100 percent.
The monitor shows the original image without the special effect. When you
change a property’s value, Premiere automatically creates a new keyframe in the
timeline, which stores the changed value. Premiere adds the keyframe right
where the playhead is.
14. Press the Home button and then the space bar.
The preview in the monitor shows the Find Edges effect grow in intensity, reach
a peak, and then fade back to the original image. The mini-timeline shows three
diamond-shaped keyframes: one at each end (cut in half by the display) and one
in the middle.
In this exercise, you created three keyframes. Each keyframe sets the Blend With
Original property to a specific value. When you previewed the clip, you saw that
Premiere automatically adjusted the values for the effect’s Blend With Original
property for all the frames in between.

UP TO SPEED
Get a Good View of Keyframes
Keyframes, graph lines, and some of the other tools you
use to animate effects are pretty small. You can help your-
self out by making some adjustments to your workspace.
Timeline View Adjustments: First of all, right-click in the
timeline and then choose Track Size ➝Large from the
shortcut menu. This increases the vertical height of the track
in the timeline, which makes it easier to see keyframes and
make adjustments to the graph line. If it’s still hard to see
your work, you can change the track height manually, as
shown in Figure 8-7.
Use the Zoom slider above the timeline to make sure
you’ve got a close-up view of the frames you want to ani-
mate. Drag to the right to make each visible frame larger.
The tradeoff, of course, is that you see a smaller portion of
the timeline as a whole. If the thumbnail images in the
video track make it hard to see the graph line, click the
video icon to the left of the track name.
Mini-Timeline View Adjustments: You can make similar
changes when you work in the mini-timeline. There’s a Zoom
slider above the mini-timeline that lets you get a closer look
at individual frames in the timeline. It also helps to drag the
left border of the Properties panel and then the left border
of the mini-timeline.
You can drag the bottom border of the Properties panel to
give the Effects properties more room, but Premiere
doesn’t let you change the vertical height of the tracks in the
Properties panel.
Both timelines have vertical and horizontal scrollbars you
can use to zero in on particular frames, tracks, and proper-
ties. With a little fiddling, you can find the perfect view for
the job at hand.
If you’ve got a big, beautiful wide-screen monitor or a dual-
monitor system, choose Window ➝Show Docking Head-
ers. Then you can drag the timeline or the monitor to a new
location and expand your Premiere workspace.
When you want to put everything back the way it was, choose
Window ➝Restore Workspace, and all Premiere’s work pan-
els return to their right-out-of-the-box proportions.

Move your cursor over the top line on a

Navigate Among Keyframes
It’s often helpful to jump from one keyframe to the next, especially when you want
to examine the different settings for an effect’s properties. When you enable an
effect, each property displays three buttons next to the mini-timeline, which are
the same three buttons shown in Figure 8-3.The diamond-shaped button in the
middle of the trio adds and removes keyframes. Drag the playhead to a frame and
click this button to add a new keyframe, then set the value you want the property
to have. The pointed arrows on either side of the Add/Remove Keyframe button
move the playhead to the previous or next keyframe for that specific property. So if
you examine the Blend With Original settings in the previous exercise, you can
click the Previous Keyframe button to have the playhead jump to the left and dis-
play the value of the effect’s property in that keyframe.
You can examine the values for any frame in the mini-timeline, even the values
that Premiere automatically sets. Drag the playhead back and forth across the
mini-timeline and you see the Blend With Original value rise and fall.
Note: When Premiere changes the property values for the frames in between keyframes, the process is
called interpolation. You may hear editors talk about interpolation or “interpolated frames.”
Set Effect Properties Independently
Using keyframes, you can animate certain effects, such as the Find Edges effect,
and leave other effects, such as the Motion effect, unanimated. You can also pick
and choose to animate specific properties within an effect. For example, Find
Edges has two properties: Invert and Blend With Original. In the exercise on page
241, you animated the Blend With Original property and turned off the animation
for the Invert property. That doesn’t mean the Invert property doesn’t have any
effect on the clip; it just means that the Invert property isn’t set to change over time.
Go ahead and click the Invert checkbox. Immediately, you see in the monitor that
Premiere reverses the image’s color values. Drag the mini-timeline playhead, and
you see that the Invert property has the same value (On) for the entire clip. There
are no keyframes because you haven’t turned Invert’s animation—its change over
time—on (you haven’t clicked the stopwatch beside Invert yet, in other words).
With the playhead somewhere in the middle of the mini-timeline, click the Toggle
Animation button next to Invert. Premiere inserts a new keyframe for the Invert
property and stores the current Invert value (Animation On) in that keyframe.
Drag the playhead to a new location and click the Invert checkbox again. Premiere
adds a second keyframe in the Invert timeline, changing the value of the Invert
property (to Animation Off).

Chapter 8: Create Animated Effects
247
Use Keyframes to
Create Your Own
Effect
Preview the clip, and you see that the Invert property is on from the beginning of
the clip, and remains on as it passes the first Invert keyframe. At the second Invert
keyframe, the Invert effect is turned off because it was at that point that you dese-
lected the Invert button.
Move, Copy, Paste, and Delete Keyframes
Keyframes provide visual cues that help you animate a clip. The cues are subtle
and, because keyframes are small, easy to overlook. The first and last keyframes in
a timeline have shading on half of the icon, while keyframes in the middle have a
solid color. In the mini-timeline, selected keyframes show a blue highlight, so
they’re a different color than unselected keyframes (light gray). For some examples
of the different visual cues, see Figure 8-8.
Working with keyframes in the mini-timeline isn’t that different from working
with words in your word processor. You can select, move, copy, and paste them at
different points along the timeline.
• Select keyframes. Click on a keyframe to select it. If you want to select more
than one keyframe, hold down the Ctrl key as you click additional keyframes. If
you want to select a bunch of keyframes that are close together, click and drag a
selection box around them (Figure 8-9).
• Deselect keyframes. The easiest way to deselect all keyframes in the mini-timeline
is to click an empty place in the timeline. If you select multiple keyframes with
the Ctrl-click method, you can also Ctrl-click to deselect individual keyframes.
Figure 8-8:
Here are five keyframes for
two different properties. Each
property has a separate graph

• Move keyframes. It’s easy to move keyframes in the mini-timeline. Just drag the
keyframe to a new location. You can even drag a keyframe past another one on
the timeline—they don’t bump into each other; they just pass on through like
good neighbors on a trail. If you select several keyframes, they all move when
you drag one of them.
• Copy keyframes. No big surprise here. You can copy selected keyframes using
the usual Ctrl+C command, or you can right-click a selected keyframe and
choose Copy from the shortcut menu. Premiere stores copied keyframes in its
clipboard (its temporary memory) until you copy something else. You can paste
the contents of the clipboard as described next.
• Paste keyframes. Press Ctrl+V to paste keyframes in the clipboard into the
mini-timeline or right-click and choose Paste from the shortcut menu. Newly
pasted keyframes appear at the position of the playhead. If you want, you can
paste more than once—copying the same properties to different places in the
mini-timeline.
• Delete keyframes. There are a couple of ways to delete keyframes. If you want
to remove a single keyframe, the quickest way is to right-click the keyframe and
choose Cut or Clear from the shortcut menu. The Cut command places a copy
of the keyframe in Premiere’s clipboard, and you can paste it into the mini-
timeline later. The Clear command simply deletes the keyframe.
To delete multiple keyframes, shift-click to select the bunch and then press the
Delete key. Alternatively, you can drag a box around several keyframes and then
delete them.

Effect
• Delete all keyframes. Click the stopwatch to remove all the keyframes from a
property or click the Effect stopwatch to remove all the keyframes in an effect. A
box pops up to warn you that Premiere will remove the keyframes.
Suppose you want to create a strobe effect using Find Edge’s Invert property. By
turning the Invert property on and off rapidly, you create a flicker effect as you
swap colors. Creating the strobe effect gives you a great way to practice moving,
copying, and pasting keyframes.
Famous Movie Moment: In keeping with its 1960s origins, Peter Fonda’s Easy Rider used lots of
color-shifts and strobe-like special effects.
1. Drag the playhead to a position near the middle of the mini-timeline.
Starting in the middle makes it easier to see and select keyframes.
2. If necessary, click the Toggle Animation button for Find Edges and its Invert
property.
The stopwatch icons display a blue highlight when you toggle animation on.
When you first toggle the Invert property, it creates a keyframe.
3. Drag the playhead to the right and then click the Invert checkbox.
Clicking the checkbox changes the Invert property and creates a new keyframe
in the mini-timeline.
4. Preview the effect.
The first keyframe sets the Invert property for the entire first portion of the clip.
The second keyframe changes the Invert property.
5. Click and drag the keyframes to adjust the timing.
Drag the keyframes closer together if you want to shorten the duration of the
strobe effect.
6. Ctrl-click to select the two key frames and then press Ctrl+C.
As you Ctrl-click the keyframes, they display a “selected” blue highlight. When
you press Ctrl+C, Premiere stores the keyframes and their property settings in
its clipboard.
7. Drag the playhead to a new position to the right of the keyframes and then
press Ctrl+V.
Premiere pastes two new keyframes into the mini-timeline. Each has the same
values as the original keyframes.
8. Repeat Step 7 to create multiple strobe flashes in the timeline.
You can paste the same copied keyframes into the timeline as many times as
you want, as shown in Figure 8-10.

9. Press the Home button and then the space bar to preview the effect.
When you do, you see the image’s colors reverse completely with each key-
frame. If you move the keyframes on the timeline, you can change the timing of
the strobe effect.
Edit Keyframes in the Main Timeline
You can see keyframes in the main timeline, too. But there are some differences
between this view and the view in the mini-timeline. In the main timeline, you can
only see the value of keyframe properties one property at a time. Chapter 7
explained that the yellow line running horizontally through clips in the timeline
reflect the value of a particular property in an effect. The name of the property that
Premiere graphs appears at the top of the timeline. For example, Figure 8-11 shows
that the graph line is displaying the value of the Find Edges:Blend With Original
property. To display a different property in the clip, click anywhere on the prop-
erty name and a menu appears where you can choose a different property.

This figure shows the result after
two keyframes in the Invert
property were copied and pasted

Edit Keyframes in
the Main Timeline
Different types of properties have a different look in the timeline. Properties that
are set with sliders and number boxes tend to change gradually over time, so their
graph line looks smooth and consistent, like the Find Edges:Blend With Original
line in Figure 8-11. On the other hand, a property like Find Edges:Invert is con-
trolled by a checkbox, so it can only have one of two values, either On or Off.
Figure 8-12 shows how different the graph line for the strobe effect looks as you
turn Invert on and off using keyframes.
You can drag a keyframe in the main timeline to change a property’s timing or
value. As you do, a tooltip displays the time and the property value. That makes
the timeline a great place to edit effect properties.
To change the timing of an effect, drag the keyframe horizontally along the time-
line. To change the value for an effect’s property, drag the keyframe vertically. As
you make these changes, the yellow graph line adjusts to reflect the new values.
Figure 8-13 shows the Find Edges: Blend With Original property as it’s being
changed.
You can use the same technique to change keyframe timing in the Properties
panel’s mini-timeline, but the main timeline is larger and gives you more information
as you edit.
As in the mini-timeline, each video and audio track on the timeline has three key-
frame control buttons—they mimic the Jump To and Add/Remove Keyframe buttons
in the mini-timeline. Use the middle diamond-shaped button to add and remove
keyframes. Use the left- and right-arrow buttons to jump to the previous or next
keyframe. You can use the same techniques described on page 247 to select, copy,
paste, and delete keyframes in the main timeline.

The Find Edges:Invert
property is either on or

As any school kid knows, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line,
and that’s the method Premiere uses to create values between keyframes, as you
can see by the yellow graph lines. For example, the straight line in Figure 8-11
shows the value for the Find Edges:Blend With Original property. But what if you
don’t want those values to take the shortest route to the next keyframe? Perhaps
you’d like the Blend With Original property to change rapidly at first and then
more slowly later on, and you want to display the Find Edges effect for a longer

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Timeline vs. Mini-Timeline
Which is better, the timeline or the mini-timeline?
If you can edit keyframes in both the main timeline and the
Properties panel’s mini-timeline, how do you know which
one works better? The answer is: You’ll probably end up
using both. Though they do many of the same chores, the
tools and the views work differently. The mini-timeline
makes it easy to see all the effects applied to a clip and easy
to jump around and make changes to multiple effects and
properties. The main timeline’s graph makes it easy to see
how a single property changes over time, but it’s a little bit
more cumbersome to jump around and compare different
properties.
As you work with animated effects, you’ll settle into your
own rhythm for choosing the main timeline or the mini-
timeline. Here are some general guidelines to get you
started:
• Use the mini-timeline when you want to change
multiple properties. It’s quick and easy to jump
around to different effects and properties in the
Properties panel.
• Use the main timeline when you want to work pri-
marily with a single property. The graph line makes
it easy to visualize the changes of a single property
over time. If you want to manually control the rate
of change in an animated effect, you have to use the
main timeline.

period of time? You could make those changes by adding keyframes, but you can
do the same thing—and create a smoother effect—by changing the type of key-
frame you apply to the effect. Right-click a keyframe in the main timeline, and the
shortcut menu lists different types of keyframes (Figure 8-14).
• Linear is the standard, shortest-distance-between-two-points keyframe that
Premiere uses unless you change it.
• Bezier creates smooth curves around a keyframe. You can control the arc of
the curve using Bezier control handles as shown in Figure 8-16. Unlike the
Bezier options below, this option lets you change the position of the two con-
trol handles independently.
• Auto Bezier creates a consistent rate of change as the graph line passes through
a keyframe; there are no abrupt changes of direction. When you change a key-
frame to Auto Bezier, Premiere automatically positions the two handles to create
the smoothest curves possible on both sides of the keyframe. If you manually
move the handles, the keyframe changes to a Continuous Bezier.
• Continuous Bezier also creates a smooth curve, the difference being that you can
manually adjust the handles so that the segments on either side of the keyframe
are dramatically different. Even so, Continuous Bezier keeps the transition
smooth. When you move one handle, the opposite handle moves automatically,
too, and the two control lines always form a curve with a smooth form.
• Hold sets a property value and keeps that value constant. There may be a curve
in front of the keyframe, but there’s no curve following a Hold keyframe. In
fact, the property value remains unchanged until the next keyframe or the end
of the clip.
Figure 8-14:
Right-click a keyframe to
change the keyframe type.
There are five options. Use the
Bezier options to create curved
or more complex graph lines.

Tip: When you work with keyframes and Bezier curves, the clip background showing frames can be dis-
tracting. Click the Set Video Display Track Style button (Figure 8-15) to choose a simpler background for
your curves and keyframes.
Adjust Bezier Curves
You find Bezier curves in all sorts of computer graphics programs because they’re
an easy way to define curves. In those programs, two grabbable lines with handles
sprout from points along the Bezier curve. The lines don’t appear in the final
graphic—they’re just there so you can easily adjust the curve. You, the artist, drag
the handles to different positions, changing the shape of the curve.
Adobe includes Bezier curves in programs like Illustrator and Photoshop. In Pre-
miere, it uses Bezier curves to control the shape of the Effects graph line. The graph
line, in turn, charts the rate of change of an effect’s property. If you’re happy with
the straight lines that Premiere automatically uses when you create a keyframe, you
don’t have to do anything. If you want to fine-tune the rate of change to create a
smoother effect, right-click on a keyframe and choose Bezier or Continuous Bez-
ier. Adjust the shape of the curve by dragging the handles (Figure 8-16). (The only
way to manually control the curve of a graph line is via the main timeline; you
can’t edit a curve in the mini-timeline.)
If you haven’t worked with Bezier curves in other programs, the easiest way to
understand them is to jump in and work with them.
The biggest hassle with the Bezier curves in the timeline is that everything is so
small: the keyframe markers, the Bezier control lines, and the handles. As a
reminder, to get a larger view of the timeline, find an empty spot on in the time-
line, right-click, and select Track Size ➝ Large.

With all the different types of keyframes, how do you know exactly what type Pre-
miere uses at a given point? When you work in the timeline, right click a keyframe
and you see a list of keyframe types, one of which has a checkmark beside it. That
checkmark identifies the type of keyframe it is, as you can see in Figure 8-17.
When you work in the Properties panel’s mini-timeline, you won’t see a graph
line, but different types of keyframes have different icons. Figure 8-18 gives you a
reference for Premiere’s five types of keyframe. To convert a keyframe from one
type to another—for example, from Linear to Bezier—right-click the keyframe and
choose the new keyframe type from the shortcut menu.

Click and drag the handles on the Bezier control lines to

Animate Clips on
the Screen
Animate Clips on the Screen
Every video clip has a fixed effect called Motion that controls the dimensions of a
clip and its position on the screen. You use Motion effects when you want to zoom
in on part of a clip. When you zoom in, you can pan and tilt the “camera” to see
different parts of an image. (It’s not really a camera, of course; you create the illu-
sion of a camera by moving the clip so the video frame shows the good parts.)
When you create a picture-in-picture (PIP) effect, you shrink the size of a clip and
then position it on top of another clip (Figure 8-19). With Motion effects, you can
move the smaller images around the screen. Master the Position and Scale con-
trols, and you can perform just about any multi-image effect in the book, from a
24-style split-screen to a Ken Burns–style documentary shot.
There are only a handful of Motion effect properties you need to learn:
• The Position setting has two properties. They aren’t labeled, but you can think
of them as horizontal and vertical positions (or as X and Y coordinates if you’re
used to dealing with X-Y coordinates). The coordinate 0,0 is the upper-left corner
of an image.
The Position setting defines the position of a clip’s anchor point. Initially, an
image’s anchor point is the center of a clip, but you can change that using the
Anchor Point setting, as described below.
• Use the Scale property to change the size of the playback window. All clips start
out at 100% (full-frame). Use a setting smaller than 100 percent for picture-in-
picture effects. Use a larger number to zoom in on and view a small portion of a
clip. Premiere automatically keeps your image properly proportioned unless
you turn off the Uniform Scale checkbox.
• Scale Width is grayed out and unavailable until you turn off the Uniform Scale
checkbox. Then you can use Scale Width to distort your video image by chang-
ing its width and height independently.
Figure 8-18:
In the Properties panel, each type of keyframe has a
different icon. As you can see, you can mix and
match different types of keyframes within the same
graph line.

• Uniform Scale controls whether the image stays in proportion. With the box
checked, the image maintains the proportions of the original clip if you resize it.
• Rotation controls the rotation of a clip using degrees as the unit of measure.
Clips rotate around the anchor point, which starts out in the center of the clip
unless you change it with the Anchor Point settings below.
• Rotate Left spins your clip counter clockwise in 90-degree increments.
• Rotate Right spins your clip clockwise in 90-degree increments.
• Anchor Point sets the anchor point in your clip—the point used as the reference
point for positioning and rotating clips. You define the anchor point using two
numbers, which represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the image.
The coordinate 0,0 is the upper-left corner of the image. Try it; click on each of
the two anchor-point coordinates to highlight them and type “0” into each. The
upper-left corner of your image becomes the center point on the screen.
• The Anti-Flicker Filter helps minimize flicker when interlaced video is shown
on computer monitors and the new high-definition TVs. If you have flicker-
prone images, experiment with this setting. Use it just enough to remove the
flicker problem. If you use it at too high a setting, it can cause blurring.

Create Custom Zooms and Pans
Using the Scale settings, you can zoom in on a clip to view just a portion of an
image. You can zoom in as much as 600 percent, but there’s a cost to such a dra-
matic zoom: your image is likely to get fuzzy, as explained in the box on page 259.
Once you zoom in on a clip, you can choose which portion of the image to view. If
you want to move the “camera” to view different parts of a clip while it plays back,
that’s called panning, which is explained on page 256.
Begin with a clip in the timeline and then follow these steps. The easiest way to see
how Motion effects work is to use a still image or a clip where the camera isn’t
zooming, panning, or moving.
1. Select the clip and choose Window ➝ Properties.
The clip Properties panel opens, displaying the fixed effects, including Motion.
2. Click the triangle button next to Motion.
The Motion effects panel opens, showing several settings, including Scale.
3. Click Scale and type in a new number, as shown in Figure 8-20.
Like most number boxes in Premiere, you can also click and drag to scrub in a
new value.
4. In the monitor, drag the image to reposition it.
As you reposition the clip in the frame, the Motion:Position properties change
automatically.
When you preview the clip, the entire clip plays at the new Zoom setting. The clip
is now anchored to a single position in the frame.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Get Centered Again
I accidentally moved a video clip off-frame. I tried to undo
it with Ctrl+Z, but it was too late. How do I get centered
again?
It’s not too hard to put your video back in the middle of the
screen. Here’s the solution.
Premiere puts the “anchor” for each image smack dab in the
middle of each frame, so it’s a matter of positioning the
anchor in the middle of the frame again. Click the Properties
button above the timeline and then open the Motion panel.
The item at the top is the Position setting. If your video isn’t
centered, you’ve got some screwy numbers in there.
Next, choose Edit ➝Project Settings ➝General to open a
dialog box with your project settings. Next to Frame Size,
you’ll see a horizontal number and a vertical number.
Divide the horizontal number in half and replace the first
number in the Properties panel Motion:Position setting
with it. Then, divide the vertical number in half and put that
in place of the second number. That’s right: Because Pre-
miere makes the center of your clip the anchor point, the
proper horizontal position for the anchor is half the frame
width, and the perfect vertical position is half the frame
height.

Create an Animated Pan-Zoom Effect
The previous steps don’t really create an animated Zoom effect. To do that, you
need to create two keyframes with different zoom settings. Here are the steps to
add a gradual zoom that also pans to a particular part of the image.
1. In the main timeline, move the playhead to a position near the beginning of
a clip.
Use either a still image or a clip with minimal motion.
2. Click the Add/Remove keyframe button.
Premiere creates a keyframe in the main timeline at the position of the playhead.
3. Click the Properties button in the timeline (or go to Window ➝ Effects).
The clip Properties panel shows the fixed effects and any other effects you
applied to the selected clip.
4. Set the Motion:Scale property to 100 percent.
The zoom effect starts off displaying the full frame.
Figure 8-20:
Change the size of a clip with the Motion:Scale setting.
Use a value like 130 percent to zoom in on an image.
Use a value like 60 percent to make the clip smaller.
UP TO SPEED
Overcome Zoom-Size Issues
The major drawback to zooming in on a video clip is that it
lowers the clip’s resolution. Often, zooming in produces an
image that’s blurry or blocky. When you scale an image
beyond 150 percent, it definitely starts looking scraggly.
There are some ways to work around this problem. The
easiest fix is to use a clip with an image that’s larger than
your video frame size. For example, if you create a video
slide show from still images, you can use still images with a
higher resolution than your video’s frame size. That gives
you plenty of room to zoom in and pan around your image.
You can do the same thing with video if you shoot in high
definition (1980x1080) and then render your movie at a
lower resolution, such as standard DV (720 × 480).

5. Click the Toggle Animation button beside Motion and make sure the button
next to Position toggles on, too (in fact, all the effects should toggle on, which
is fine for this exercise).
The keyframe stores the Position properties.
6. Move the playhead 5 to 10 seconds down the mini-timeline.
This is enough time to preview the zoom, but not so long that it puts you to
sleep. Your mileage may vary.
7. Click the Add/Remove keyframe button beside the Scale property.
A second keyframe appears in the mini-timeline.
8. Set the Motion:Scale property to a value between 100 and 140 percent.
If you begin with a high-resolution image, like a hi-res still, you may want to
zoom in even more.
9. Click the image in the monitor and drag it to reposition it.
Once you’re zoomed in, you can reposition the image to find the most interest-
ing part of it. A new keyframe for Motion:Position stores the value of the new
position. When you move an image with animation toggled on, a line appears
on the image in the monitor (Figure 8-21). This line won’t appear in the final
video—it’s an animation tool called a “motion path.”
When you preview the clip this time, the “camera” zooms in and moves to focus
on the portion of the image you selected in the last step. Technically, this is called a
Pan-Zoom effect. When you shoot video with a camcorder, you create a “pan” by
pivoting the camera in a horizontal direction. Pivot in a vertical direction, and
that’s called a “tilt.” To create a similar effect in Premiere, you move the anchor
Figure 8-21:
If you move an image with Motion:Position
animation toggled on, Premiere creates a “motion
path” that shows how the clip’s anchor position
changes over time. The circled crosshairs show the

point for a clip. In the exercise above, you established the anchor point in Step 5
and repositioned it in Step 9. Dragging an image in the monitor is the same as
changing the Motion:Position setting.
Tip: You can save any of the Motion effects for reuse by right-clicking the effect in the Properties panel
and choosing Save Preset. See page 217 for all the details on creating presets.
Adjust a Clip’s Motion Path
As shown in the previous example, you create a pan effect by creating two key-
frames with different Motion:Position values. Unless you provide other instructions,
Premiere creates a straight-line move. If you want to precisely control the motion
of a pan or pan zoom, you use the “motion path” tool. It maps the position of an
image’s anchor point over time.
You sculpt and shape the motion path with keyframes and Bezier curve controls.
Yep, those are the same tools you used to shape the Effects graph line, as described
on page 254.
• Move the start or end point of the motion path. Place the playhead over the
clip you used above and drag the X point to a new location.
• Add a keyframe to the motion path. First of all, make sure you have the
Motion:Position property toggled on. Then drag the playhead to a new posi-
tion. The frame marker, which looks like a circle with cross hairs, moves along
the motion path as you do so. Drag the clip to a new position and Premiere
automatically creates a new keyframe that stores the new Position property.
• Change the shape of the motion path. You change the shape of the motion path
by repositioning the end points or the keyframes in the motion path (see
Figure 8-22). You can create curves by right-clicking the keyframes and then
choosing one of the Bezier options from the shortcut menu. See page 253 for a
description of the different keyframe options.
Create Picture-in-Picture Effects
Premiere comes with a bunch of picture-in-picture preset effects. To check them
out, open the Effects panel (Edit ➝Effects). Then, choose Presets from the first
drop-down menu and choose PIPs in the secondary menu. Once there, you’ll see
dozens of presets that shrink clips to various sizes and make them scoot across the
screen in various directions.
Tip: You can learn a few PIP tricks by adding one of the preset PIPs to your video and then analyzing
how Premiere creates the effect. In the Properties panel, examine all the Motion properties as well as
Opacity, Blur, and any other standard effects the preset uses.

If you prefer to roll your own PIP effect, it’s not hard to do. You need to start out
with two clips in different tracks in the Timeline—for example, in Video 1 and
Video 2. Here are the steps to create a stationary picture-in-picture in the lower
corner of the frame:
1. Click the clip in the Video 2 track and then click the Properties button in the
timeline.
The clip Properties panel shows the fixed effects, including Motion.
2. In the properties panel, click the triangle next to Motion.
The Motion effect panel opens, showing the settings for different Motion
properties.
3. Click the Scale number box and type in 30.
Naturally, you can scale your image down to any size that works for your
project, but 25 to 30 percent works well for a lot of situations. It’s similar to the
PIP effect used for TVs.
4. Drag the small clip to the lower left corner of screen.
As you reposition the picture, the Position settings change to show the new
anchor point.
When you preview the movie, both clips play back, remaining in the same posi-
tion. Using the Position settings, you can move the little picture around the screen,
including having it pop in, play for a while, and then pop out of view.

Animate a Picture-in-Picture
To animate the PIP effect, all you need to do is add keyframes to control the
Motion:Position property value for the smaller picture. Here are the steps to make
the small picture from the previous exercise fly onto the screen from the left, hang
around for a while, and then go off the right side of the screen.
1. Drag the playhead all the way to the left of the clip.
This puts the playhead at frame 1.
2. Change the Motion:Position value for the first position to a negative number,
like –1,600.
The small picture should be completely out of view. The first number in the
Position settings controls the image’s horizontal position.
3. Click the Toggle Animation button for Motion:Position.
This creates a keyframe at frame1 and stores the Position value.
4. Drag the playhead to a position 2 or 3 seconds into the clip.
You’ll make this point in time the place where your clip will pause on the
screen.
5. Change the first Position value to center the small window on the screen.
Try using the first anchor point value here. If your clip started at the same size
as your project setting, this centers the clip horizontally.
6. Drag the playhead down the timeline a few more seconds and click the Add/
Remove Keyframe button.
Premiere creates a new keyframe and stores the same “centered” Position value
once more but at a different point in the timeline.
7. Drag the playhead to the end of the clip.
You’re ready to create the final keyframe by specifying a position where the
small picture is completely out of frame.
8. Change the first Position value to a number that’s greater than the width of
your frame. For example, if your video frame size is 1,280 pixels, a value of
1,600 will do the trick, as shown in Figure 8-23.
When you preview the PIP animation, it starts off with a single image. Then the
small picture moves in from the left. It stops at the center of the screen for a few
beats and then moves off the right side. Naturally, you can change the timing by
moving any of the timeline keyframes horizontally. You can edit the motion path
for the small picture as described on page 261. But first you’ve got to select the
small picture. Move the playhead so the small picture is displayed on the screen,
then double-click the small picture. Premiere adds a selection box around it and
displays its motion path over the larger picture.

Animate an Effects Mask
Chapter 7 explained how to create an effects mask (page 203), which is basically a
small window that shows an effect. The part of the image outside of that window
doesn’t display the effect. To add an Effects mask to your clip, in the timeline (not
the monitor) right-click on the clip and then choose Effects Mask ➝Apply from
the shortcut menu. Then apply an effect like Find Edges to the clip. The effect only

Mask effect (Figure 8-24). The settings for it position the corners of the mask. You
can animate the positions, the same way you moved the window in the exercise on

Split the Playback Screen
Splitting the playback screen for a 24-style, multiple-screen effect is simply a mat-
ter of positioning more than one screen in the monitor. You can have many
screens visible at a time, but when you get beyond four, it’s hard for your audience
to know where to look. Here are the steps for creating a three-screen movie, where
all three images are the same size:
1. Drag three clips to the Timeline, placing each on a separate track, as shown in
Figure 8-25.
The clips should be on the Video 1, Video 2, and Video 3 tracks. While they’re
scaled at 100 percent, the top clip hides the clips underneath.
2. Select the clip in the top track and click the Properties button in the timeline.
The Properties panel displays all the fixed effects and any standard effects you
applied.
3. Open the Motion panel and then change the Scale property to 50.
When you scale the clip to a size smaller than the playback window, you see the
clip on the track below.
4. Drag the clip to the top center of the screen.
If you want to be precise, you can change the values in the Motion:Position
settings.
5. Select the clip on the second track and then, in Properties, change Motion:
Scale to 50.
When you change the size of this second clip, the bottom clip shows through.
Figure 8-25:
These three clips play
simultaneously because
they’re in the same
position on the timeline.
You have to scale to a
smaller size for the clips
in the lower tracks to
be visible.

6. Drag the second clip to one of the lower corners.
Again, if you want to be precise, you can change the values in the Motion:Position
settings.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for the final clip.
With the clips scaled to 50 percent, you should be able to see all of each clip on
the screen (Figure 8-26). Of course, you can scale and position the clip frames
however you want.

After placing three clips
on different tracks as

you can resize and

Add Titles
You work hard to make your movies look good, but if you really want to give them
a professional polish, don’t stop after you edit your last frame. Consider adding
titles.
You might think of titles as simply beginning and end credits, but they’re useful in
the middle of your movie, too. Think of all the times you’ve read “Six Years Ear-
lier” or “Meanwhile, back at Alamogordo…” News shows and documentaries
identify interviewees with banners at the bottom of the screen. And then, of
course, there’s Stephen Colbert’s nightly segment “The Word,” where titles mock
him throughout his presentation.
This chapter covers titles from opening frame to closing credits. It starts off with
guidelines for good titles, then explains how you can use predesigned title tem-
plates that come with Premiere. You’ll learn how to tweak those templates for your
own nefarious purposes and how to create your own custom titles. You’ll even
learn how to create a “crawl,” the line of text that runs across the bottom of the
screen during newscasts.
The Rules of Good Titles
The first rule of titles is: Use titles to tell your audience something they wouldn’t
know by just watching your movie. The second rule is: Titles need to be readable if
you’re going to accomplish the first rule.
What makes titles unreadable? Bad design decisions, like:
• Type that’s too small.

268
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
The Rules of Good
Titles
• Type that gets lost on a busy background.
• Poor type/background color choices.
• Text that doesn’t stay on the screen long enough.
You want all your viewers to benefit from your title’s words of wisdom, so remember
that not everyone has perfect vision or reads at the same speed you do.
If you use Premiere’s title templates without any changes (except for the words, of
course), you don’t have to remember these rules, because the template designers
know them forward and backward, and they followed the rules as they created the
templates. But if you want to make changes to a template or if you want to create
your own titles, consider the following tips:
• Choose a readable font size. Font size isn’t usually a problem for opening titles,
which tend to loom large in the center of the screen. But you want to make sure
that your credit and caption titles are large enough to read, too. What’s readable
on your computer screen looks a lot smaller on a TV screen that’s across the
room, and even worse after your entire video’s been compressed for the Web.
• Choose a readable typeface. Not all typefaces (a.k.a. fonts) are created equal,
especially when it comes to video. Thin, spindly, delicate typefaces don’t work
very well for video. In general, you want your type fairly thick and bold, espe-
cially if you use it against a busy background. You can use a serif typeface, one
that has little feet and adornments at the edge of the letters (the type in this
paragraph is serif, for example), but if you do, use a heftier serif, like this one,
called “
.”
Mixing fonts on the same screen can be tricky business. If you’re unsure which
typefaces work well together, study or steal some of the combinations used in
the title templates. You shouldn’t need more than a couple of typefaces for your
whole project—maybe a fancy one for your movie’s title and something sim-
pler and bolder for the smaller credits and captions.
• Separate text from the background. There are oh-so-many ways your type can
get lost in a background image, many of which you learn through trial and
error. If you overlay type on a busy or animated image, your titles are going to
be hard to read. The solution? Use a solid background or still image. The best
solution of all is to shoot footage specifically for your titles as shown in
Figure 9-1. Usually, it’s best to put light-colored type on dark backgrounds (as
shown in Figure 9-2) or vice-versa. In a pinch, you can dial down the opacity of
the background video clip; this helps make the text stand out.
• Choose the right colors. You want your text to contrast with its background
without clashing with it. It’s fine to coordinate colors, just make sure there’s
enough difference between them so that the text stands out. Drop shadows and
outlines can help “lift” text off a page.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

Beyond that, some colors cause trouble when it comes to playback. For exam-
ple, bright reds can create an unsightly smear on the screen because the color
tends to bleed beyond the outlines of the letters. If you find colors bleeding
when you preview your video, try making the color a bit darker. What’s the best
color for video? Most videographers feel yellows work best for type. Next to
that, white characters on a dark background work well.
• Stay within the frame. When you work with titles, Premiere automatically dis-
plays two white rectangles on the screen, called “safe” areas. The larger rectangle
represents the video-safe area. To make sure all TVs and playback windows display
your video properly, keep your image within this frame. The inner frame is the
title-safe area. Keep your titles inside this rectangle.
• Control the scroll. It’s important to keep words on the screen long enough for
people to read them. Most pros feel that you should be able to read the text two
or three times at a decent clip before your video moves on, and that’s true
whether you use static or scrolling text. You don’t want to err too much in the
other direction, either. Nothing’s gained by leaving text on the screen long
enough to bore your audience.
In addition to these basic rules, consider aesthetics. A typeface like the one in the
subtitle in Figure 9-1 might work great for a movie about horses or the Wild West,
but it’s a little old-fashioned for a film about marauding robots. If you use tinted
text, keep the text color in line with your film’s theme, too. You wouldn’t use red
and green for a Halloween movie, for example.
If you follow the rules for good titles and consider the aesthetics as you make
design decisions, your titles will give your video a professional touch.
Use a Title Template
The fastest and easiest way to add well-designed titles to your project is to use Pre-
miere’s title templates. Drag an opening title template into your movie timeline,
change the text to reflect your project, and you’re done. It’s easy and looks great.
And the templates come with matching closing credits and smaller bottom-of-the-
screen banners (which the pros call “lower-third” titles).
A big advantage to these templates is that professional designers created them, so
they have some design flair to them (in the Drive-In template, for example, a half-
circle of cars sit in front of a drive-in movie screen, which displays the title of your
movie) and they include coordinated fonts. In addition, the templates respect the
technical issues of titling; they use video-safe colors and have text boxes posi-
tioned within the safezones. Finally, if you apply one of Premiere’s themes to your
video (such as Extreme Sports or Music Video), the theme’s title templates match
the theme aesthetics.

Chapter 9: Add Titles

Use a Title Template
The bottom line is that if you find a title template that works well with your
project, you’ve saved yourself a ton of work. Even if you find a template that’s close
to what you want, you’re ahead of the game because you can edit it using the tech-
niques described on page 274.
Here are the steps for creating an opening title for a film called London at Night.
You don’t need any clips in the timeline for this first step, so start with a brand-
new project.
1. In the Tasks panel, click the Edit tab.
It displays five buttons for the major editing tasks: Effects, Transitions, Titles,
Themes, and Clip Art.
2. Click Titles.
Premiere displays its title templates, as shown in Figure 9-3. Two drop-down
menus help you find the template you want: the Titles menu on the left and a
secondary menu to the right of that.
3. Click the Titles menu and then choose Entertainment.
The titles panel displays several templates that fit this category.
4. Click the secondary menu and then choose NightVision.
Premiere displays three title templates. Their names describe their purpose:
NightVision_title (for your movie’s title), NightVision_credit (for end credits),
and NightVision_left3rd (for captions). As you mouse over each title, it dis-
plays a Play button. Click one of them to see a thumbnail preview. For exam-
ple, click NightVision_credit and closing credits roll off the screen.
Click either of the other two clips’ Play button, and the button disappears, giv-
ing you a clear view of the thumbnail—but, oddly, there’s no animation, just a
static title screen. In reality, these clips, like all title clips, have a duration of
5 seconds; it’s just that it “plays” a static image.
5. Drag the NightVision_title clip to the first frame in the timeline’s Video 1
track.
NightVision_title is a static clip. It sports eerie green text and a background
designed to look like an overhead shot of a town seen through a nightscope.
The Title Toolbar appears next to the monitor. The arrow icon at the top repre-
sents the Selection tool. Use it to select a new font or text box in the monitor.
The tool second from the top, called the Type tool, lets you edit text—just what
you need to change this template for your project.
6. Click the Select tool and then click the words “Night Vision” in the monitor.
When you do, a rectangular frame and control handles appear around the
words. You’ve selected a text box.

272
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Use a Title Template
7. In the Title Toolbar, click the Type tool and then drag the text cursor (it looks
like an I-beam) over the words “Night Vision” to highlight them.
Once you select the text box to edit a title, you can use many of the standard
word-editing tricks you find in word processors. For example, double-click a
word to select the entire word. When you start typing after you highlight text,
new text replaces the selected text. You can use arrow keys to move the cursor
within the text. Be patient though, even on a fast computer there’s a bit of a lag
when you work with titles.
8. Replace “Night Vision” with the word London, as shown in Figure 9-2.
Then choose the Selection tool and click anywhere on the screen. When you do,
you see the words in the title clip in the timeline change from “Night Vision” to
“London” (this template automatically capitalizes all words, by the way). Keep
in mind that any changes you make to the title in the monitor merely change the
clip, not the template itself. Back in the Titles Template panel, NightVision_title
looks just as it did when you started.
9. With the Selection tool, double-click on any of the words in “Subtitle Goes
Here.”
When you double-click text in a title, Premiere automatically opens the text box
for editing and changes your cursor to the Type tool.
10.Replace “Subtitle Goes Here” with “At Night”.
The complete title now reads “London” in big type, and, below that in smaller
type and with a different but complementary typeface, “At Night.” Even after
you changed the text, the titles retain the template’s style.
Figure 9-3:
Like Effects and Transitions, the
Title panel has two drop-down
menus to help you zero in on
the assets you need. Use the
Titles menu on the left to choose
a general category, such as
Entertainment or Memories.
Then use the secondary menu to
zero in a specific title type
(“Broadway”, “Music Video”,
and so on).

Use a Title Template
You edit all the title templates the same way. It doesn’t matter if they’re for open-
ing titles, credits, or captions. To use a title, drag it onto your timeline. If you want
to change the running time for a title, trim it just the way you would any clip—
drag the end of the clip in the timeline.
When you put a title on an empty part of the timeline, Premiere automatically gives
it a black background. If you drag a title to a track above an existing clip, Premiere
usually makes the title transparent so the title appears over the clip underneath, as
you can see in the Night Vision credits in Figure 9-4.
When you place a title over a clip, double-check it against the Rules of Good Titles
explained on page 267. In particular, make sure there’s enough contrast between
the text color and your background colors. Most of Premiere’s templates use
effects like drop shadows to help separate the type from the background. If you

Premiere does a good job of
giving you strong, readable type.
But when you place a template
over video, it’s up to you to make
sure that the title and your video

overlay a title and find that background movement detracts too much from the
text, you can always use a still image instead. Page 222 explains how to create a still
image from any frame in a video clip.
Edit a Title Template
The example above explains how to add a title from a template and how to change
the title’s text to match your project. Sometimes, you need to tweak a title a little
more to make it work. For example, what if your movie was named “Puerto Val-
larta at Night” instead of “London at Night”? Can you shoehorn the longer title
into the NightVision template? Sure. Here’s how:
1. Double-click the main title—the one that reads “London”—and change it to
“Puerto Vallarta.”
When you finish, the title looks something like Figure 9-5, with the text stretch-
ing outside of the title-safe area (and even outside the video-safe area).
Note: The figures for this example were created with HDV 720-pixel project settings. Your mileage may
vary if your project has a different frame size.
Figure 9-5:
When you change the
NightVision title from
“London” to “Puerto
Vallarta,” it suddenly
extends beyond the title-
safe and video-safe
frames. That means your
audience won’t see all of
the title on a TV screen.

2. Move the text cursor to the beginning of the word “Vallarta” and press the
Enter key.
That creates a new line in the text box (just as pressing the Enter key in a word
processing document would). Now the two words fit horizontally on the screen,
but “Vallarta” covers up “At Night”, and it goes beyond both safe frames at the
bottom, too. (Next time, go to Aruba.)
3. Click the Selection tool and then drag the Puerto Vallarta text box up.
The Selection tool lets you drag text boxes to any position on the screen. (You
can drag graphics objects, too, like the clip art discussed below.)
You can make lots of other changes to title templates. In fact, you can change
everything about a template—Premiere doesn’t lock any of it down. So you have
control over the typeface, text boxes, background image, the works. And you can
add new elements, too, like clipart or an additional text box. That’s why templates
are such timesavers.
The Title Toolbar
Chances are, you’ll use the tools in the Title Toolbar (Figure 9-6) whether you use
Premiere’s templates or you create your own. These tools are the same kind you
find in most graphics programs. They let you select and edit text, geometric shapes,
and lines. If you know other Adobe programs, you’ll feel right at home. If not, the
learning curve is shallow.
Here’s a rundown of the Title Toolbar:
• The Selection tool looks like an arrow. Click it and then click objects in the
monitor to select them and start editing. Use Shift-click to select more than one
object. Remember, a clip is an object; sometimes you have to select the clip
before you can select objects within the clip (like text boxes).
• The Type tool looks like an I-beam. Click on it, and you can then click any-
where in the monitor to create a new text box. If you click on an existing text
box, you can edit the words there just as you would with a word processor.
Keep in mind that you can edit text boxes, but you can’t edit text that’s embed-
ded in a still image or imported graphic.
• The Shape tools, which include the Rectangle, Ellipse, and Rounded Rectangle
tools, are handy for making backgrounds for type. You can make these shapes
look snazzy with Premiere’s color, gradient, and transparency tools.
• The Line tool is like the Shape tools—it gives you a way to draw on the moni-
tor. You can use the same color, gradient, and transparency features on lines.
• The Vertical Center and Horizontal Center buttons move a selected object to
the center of the screen.

• The Color Properties icon opens a color palette with lots of options to add style
to text, shapes, and lines. For more details, see page 277.
Create a Still Opening Title
This section explains how to create your own title from scratch. It starts with the
simplest of title designs—white type on a black background—and then, in the fol-
lowing examples, shows you how to edit it and add new features using different
titling tools.
Tip: For most movies, the opening title is the most important one. If it’s not the first thing that appears
on the screen, it’s pretty close. Opening titles usually contribute to the overall tone of a movie, so they
should match your content in feeling.
Opening titles often express a little more artistic flair than other titles, too. With fewer words on the screen,
an opening title is usually larger, so you don’t have some of the readability issues you might have with
ending credits or captions.
You can perform this little experiment on a brand-new project:
1. Move the playhead to an empty position in the timeline.
You can use any position, but if you’re creating an opening title, you might as
will begin at frame 1.
2. Choose Title ➝ New Title ➝ Default Still.
Premiere adds a new 5-second clip to the timeline—it has a black background
and white type that says “Add Text” (Figure 9-7). That’s just a little hint, in case
you don’t know what to do next.
The Title Toolbar sits to the right of the monitor (Figure 9-6).
Figure 9-6:
The Title Toolbar serves up the tools you need to work with title text and graphics in
the monitor. If you’ve used any Adobe graphics programs, you’ll feel at home with the
tools found here.

3. Click the Type tool and then click the text box and highlight “Add Text”. Then
type in your title. Something like Annie Hall might be suitable.
If you want to create a multiline title, press the Enter key at the end of each line.
4. With the text block still selected, click the Vertical Center and then the Hori-
zontal Center buttons in the Title Toolbar (they look like transistors oriented
90 degrees from each other).
With two clicks you’ve got yourself a perfectly centered title, as shown in
Figure 9-8. Don’t want it perfectly centered? Use the Selection tool to drag your
text anywhere on the screen.
Famous Movie Moment: Titles for most Woody Allen movies use white text with a serif typeface on a
black background. He began using that style in 1977 with Annie Hall, winner of multiple Academy Awards,
including Best Picture. Since then, he’s only varied from the white-on-black style a couple of times, most
notably in Manhattan, where he used the neon sign on the side of a building (customized to read “Man-
hattan”) for the movie’s title.
Change Text and Background Colors
If you’re not a fan of the Woody Allen School of Movie Titles, you can add color to
the text or the background of your opening title. Changing the text to a different
solid color is a cinch. Here are the steps:
1. Use the Selection tool to select the text box.
The selected box displays an outline and handles around the text.
2. In the Title Toolbar, click Color Properties, which is the palette icon down at
the bottom.
The Color Properties palette opens, as shown in Figure 9-9. It gives you all the
tools you need to pick a color or create a gradient (a color that subtly changes).

The spectrum bar lets you pick a basic shade, such blue, red, green, or yellow.
4. To choose a specific shade, click in the color picker box above the bar.
A circle marks the spot you click; you can move it around with your cursor to
choose just the shade you want.
The letters in the title text box change to match your selection, and Premiere
displays the selected color in the gradient box near the bottom of the Color
Properties palette.
Create a Solid-Color Background
When you add a title using the method described on page 276, Premiere automati-
cally gives you a black background for the clip. (If you place the title on a track
above an existing clip, the black area becomes transparent and the underlying clip
shows through.) If you want to put your title on any color other than black, you
need to create a background using one of the Shape tools.
1. In the Title Toolbar, click the Rectangle tool.
The cursor changes to a cross.
2. In the monitor, drag the cursor to create a rectangle.
With the rectangle tool, you can create a rectangle of any dimensions. If you
want the rectangle to cover the entire screen, it’s best to make the rectangle
extend beyond the edges of the frame, as explained in Figure 9-10. Because you
create the rectangle after Premiere creates the text box, the rectangle layer hides
the text underneath. You need to change the stacking order of the layers to put
the text back on top.
3. Right-click the rectangle and then choose Arrange ➝ Send to Back.
Sending the rectangle to the back (behind the text-box layer) ensures that the
text will show over it.
If you left your title white, you won’t notice when you send the white rectangle
to the back. Follow Steps 4 and 5 below to give the rectangle a color, and you’ll
see the white title overlay the now-tinted rectangle.
4. With the rectangle still selected, click the Color Properties icon.
The Color Properties palette opens.
5. Click a shade in the Color Spectrum and then choose a specific color with the
Color Picker.
You see the rectangle’s color change immediately in the monitor, making it easy
to try different colors until you find the one that works best with your title.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

In this example you created a solid background covering the entire frame. You
could just as easily create a strip of color in the lower third of the screen for a caption-
style title, like the one in Figure 9-11.
Create a Color Gradient
When you first open Color Properties, Premiere sets the gradient menu to Solid,
which produces the solid color described in the two previous examples. If you
want to create a more complex color effect, you can apply a gradient, where one
color gradually blends into another. Here are the steps to do that:
Note: This exercise uses the project begun on page 276. It includes a text box over a solid-color rectangle.
1. Select the solid background rectangle.
You need to select the rectangle (and any object you want to edit) before you
open the Color Properties panel. If it’s hard to select the rectangle simply by
clicking on it, right-click in the monitor and choose Select ➝Next Object Below
as many time as it takes to highlight the rectangle.
2. In the Title Toolbar, click Color Properties.
The Color Properties palette opens, displaying the current settings for the
rectangle.
Figure 9-10:
Here, a rectangle is in
mid-creation. To make
sure your rectangle
covers the entire video

here in the upper corner.
Then, to make sure you
can still see the title,
right-click the rectangle
and then choose Arrange
➝ Send to Back.

Chapter 9: Add Titles

3. Click the gradient drop-down menu and choose Linear Gradient.
The Color Properties palette displays a gradient bar with two square “color
stops,” as shown in Figure 9-12.
4. Click one of the color stops and then choose a new color.
When you select a color stop, a gray highlight appears on the small triangle
above it to confirm that you selected it. The current color appears highlighted
in the Color Picker. You can use either the Color Spectrum bar or the Color
Picker to choose a new color. Part of the rectangle’s color changes to the new
color. Sometimes there’s a little bit of a delay, so be patient.
5. Click the other color stop and set its color.
Repeat the process in Step 4 for this color stop.
Note the three boxes to the right of the Color Picker. The top one gives your
selection transparency, the middle one is a shortcut for a white background,
and the bottom one is a shortcut for a black background.
6. Drag the color stops.
Dragging the color stops along the horizontal bar changes the coverage of each
color. To increase a color’s coverage, drag it away from the edge.

When you use lots of

7. If necessary, click the Reverse button below the gradient bar.
If the colors are in exactly the wrong spots, click Reverse. The colors in the color
stops swap places and the change appears in the monitor.
8. If necessary, type a new value in the Angle box or click on the Angle circle.
By adjusting the angle, you change the direction of the gradient. For example,
you can make a gradient flow diagonally across the rectangle.
There are three color gradient options in all:
• Linear. One solid color blends into another solid color (or fades to transpar-
ency). The effect moves along a straight line, as shown in Figure 9-12.
• Radial. Similar to the linear gradient, except that one color begins as a single
point on the screen and a circular blend radiates out from that point.
• 4-Color Gradient. The gradient is made up of four colors, each starting from a
different corner of the rectangle.
In addition to the color gradients, you can choose three other gradient effects:
• Bevel. The bevel option gives your rectangle a simulated 3D beveled edge (see
Figure 9-13). You can specify the gradient’s background color (use the left box
under the drop-down menu) and set the edge color with the right box. The size
property sets the thickness of the bevel (in pixels), and the balance box specifies
how “fuzzy” the bevel edge is.

To create a gradient effect, set the color for each end of the
gradient using the small color stops. Then you can drag each
stop to adjust the color coverage.

• Eliminate. Makes the innards of text characters (or a shape) transparent so the
letters have an outline (so you can read them), but no “fill” color, meaning no
color within the letter itself. This effect is good for creating an outline of text or
an outline of a shape. Unlike Ghost, below, the Eliminate option doesn’t cast
shadows.
• Ghost. Ghost is similar to Eliminate, creating a transparent fill; however, it adds a
shadow to the characters within the shape, as shown in Figure 9-14. You can use
the Color Properties palette to set the distance, angle, and softness of the shadow.

After you add a title to the timeline, you may notice several new options over in the
Tasks panel. The panels shown in Figure 9-15 appear whenever you work with Text.
• The Text Options (Figure 9-16) panel provides standard tools for changing the
characteristics of text: its typeface, size, spacing, alignment, and style. If you’re
not sure what a setting does, hold your cursor over it and a tooltip identifies the
characteristic. To use these tools, select the text you want to format and the
characteristic you want to change. Here’s what you can do:
— Change Font. The drop-down menu under Text Options lists every font
installed on your computer, but that doesn’t mean they all work well for
video titles. See page 268 for guidelines on choosing a good font (also known
as a typeface).

— Change Font Style. Many typefaces have alternate styles, such as Bold, Bold
Italic, and SemiBold. Select them with this drop-down menu, to the right of
the font menu.
— Save Style. If you create a custom text style and want to use it for other titles
or other projects, click the Save Style button and give your style a name.
After you save it, it appears in the Text Styles panel, where you can apply it
to text with a single click.
— Change Text Size. Select text in the monitor and then change the number
next to the two Ts. Simpler, bolder fonts are more readable at smaller sizes.
With most fonts, you probably don’t want to use a font size smaller than 60.
— Leading. The distance between two lines of text is known as leading, because
in the old days printers used lead slugs to separate lines of type. You don’t
need any metal here; all you have to do is change this number.
— Kerning. With large type, like that in titles, designers often customize the dis-
tance between the letters that make up a word. For example, it’s not unusual
to close the gap between the letters A and V. Other times, designers will
deliberately change the spacing to create a style.
Text with exaggerated spacing is called letter-spaced text. Text that’s packed
tightly together is called condensed. You can adjust the distance between the

• The Text Styles panel offers styled type designed specifically for video’s special
requirements. To use any of these styles, click on a text box and then click on a
style. Use the scroll bar on the right to see all your choices. There’s quite a variety,
so it may not be hard to find one you want for your project.
Many of the styles use drop shadows and outlines to increase their readability.
In fact, if you want a brief tutorial on designing text for video, study the ele-
ments the Adobe designers used in this library. Once you’re an expert, you can
add one of your own designs. Just select text formatted with your style and then
click the Save Style button in the upper-right corner.
• The Text Animation panel provides predesigned animation effects for your text.
Click one of the animation thumbnails to see a preview. As with other special
effects and transitions, you probably want to use discretion when you animate
text. There’s a fine line between an amusing text effect and one that’s boring
after the first couple of seconds. To apply animation to text, drag the effect onto
the text box in the monitor.
Place a Title Over a Still Image
Reading a title over a moving image can be difficult and distracting. One solution
is to use a freeze frame from your video clip as the background. If you want the
image to change along with different titles, use a series of stills.
1. Position the playhead on a frame whose image you want to capture.
Simpler backgrounds work better.
2. Click the Freeze Frame button.
The Freeze Frame window opens, as shown in Figure 9-17.
3. Click Insert in Movie.
Premiere inserts a 5-second clip of the still image into the timeline. At this
point, it’s like any old clip. You can move it, drag it to another track, or trim it
by dragging the end of the clip.
4. If necessary, apply video effects to enhance the image.
You can often make titles more readable by applying one or more of the Adjust
effects to the background image. Go to Window ➝Effects. Then, in the Tasks
panel, go to Video Effects ➝Adjust. Experiment with Auto Color, Auto Con-
trast, and Auto Levels.
More dramatic, stylized effects work well with titles, too. For example, you can
de-saturate the color in an image, making it almost-but-not-quite black-and-
white. Then use a strong color for the title text over it.
To control color saturation, select the clip and go to Window ➝Properties. You
find the Saturation slider under Image Control. Some other effects that work
well for opening titles include Posterize, Tint, Pastel Sketch, and Duochrome.
If you’re in a creative mood, there are many possibilities. For example,
Figure 9-18 uses Lighting Effects to shine a spotlight on the title.

You can use any of the predesigned styles on the Text Styles panel (page 285).
Or you can create your own style from scratch, as explained on page 283.
Import Still Images for Titles
Still images don’t have to come from your video clips. You can use just about any
image as a background. If you’ve got Photoshop Elements installed on your com-
puter, you’ve probably got a whole library of stills. Click Premiere’s Organize tab
and then click Organizer. Elements Organizer opens. To add a photo to your
project, drag it from the Organizer onto the Tasks panel. After you import it, it
appears in your Project panel and in the Media panel.
If you want to use a still image that isn’t in the Organizer, bring it into your project
using the Organize ➝Get Media tools. Click on PC Files and Folders and grab the
image. For more on importing media into Premiere, see page 86.
Mix Artwork and Titles
You’re certainly not limited to freeze frames and still photos when it comes to art-
work for your titles. Premiere comes with a clipart library (go to Edit ➝ClipArt). It
divides the images into groups like Baby, Food, and Nature (Figure 9-19). To use a
clip, drag the image onto the timeline. Usually, you want to drag it to a track above
your title. That way, the black area in the clipart becomes transparent and you can
see the title beneath, as shown in Figure 9-20.
If you can’t find what you want in the ClipArt panel, you can import line art and
other graphics from computer files. The process is just like bringing in a photo. Click
the Organize tab and choose Get Media. Then, click on PC Files and Folders. At that
point, you can navigate to any folder on your computer and import graphics files
into your project. For more details on importing files into Premiere, see page 86.

In your timeline, clips with title text usually have imaginative names like “Title 01.”
That’s the name Premiere assigns to a clip when you create it. The same clip has a
spot in your Project panel. To see your title, click the Organize tab and then click

Once you create a title you like, you may want to export it—to give it to another
Premiere editor for use in their projects, for example. To do that, select the title in
the Projects panel and then go to File ➝Export ➝Title. The Save Title window
opens, and you can save your file in any folder on your computer. Premiere saves
titles with a filename that ends in .prtl.
It’s no good exporting Premiere titles unless you can import them, too. You can
import titles saved in the .prtl format. The technique for importing titles is just like
the technique for importing stills and graphics files. Go to the Organize tab and

Edit Your Sound Track
If you stay in the theater at the end of a movie as everyone else heads for the door,
you may get a glimpse of seemingly endless credits. Somewhere in there, along
with the drivers, caterers, publicists, assistants, and accountants, you’ll see a credit
for the sound designer. What a great description for the art of making a movie
sound as good as it looks. Just as you build the visuals in your movie by layering
video clips, special effects, and titles on top of each other, so you build its audio
portion, with multiple tracks that may include music, sound effects, and narration.
Chapter 3 explained how to get sound files into your computer. This chapter
explains how you craft a Hollywood-style soundtrack by layering dialog, sound
effects, music, and narration, and then fine-tuning those tracks using volume set-
tings and all kinds of effects for sound that Premiere provides.
When a soundtrack is done right, your audience is moved emotionally. They may
not realize how much the sound affected them, but they’ll feel its influence.
Design Sound from the Start
The first rule of sound design is to treat your audio as an equal partner to your
video. That means you need to plan on capturing sound just as you planned on
capturing video. Before you start shooting, you identify and organize all your
visual elements: You decide where you want your actors, where to put the camera,
and what’s visible in the background.

292
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Design Sound from
the Start
When you capture sound, you should go through a similar checklist:
• Choose your mic. Today, nearly every camcorder has a built-in mic, but that
might not always be your best choice for capturing the sound you want. On-
board microphones have limited capabilities.
Adding another mic to a shoot complicates things quite a bit. In most cases, you
need a person to hold a boom-based mic, monitor the sound, and keep the mic
out of the picture. (For tips on choosing among the many different types of
microphones, see the box on page 75.)
• Position your mic. You want to get your mic as close to your sound source as
possible. That way, you capture sound with good fidelity and volume and mini-
mize extraneous noise. That’s why camcorder mics aren’t always the best
option—they’re fixed on the camcorder. They may even pick up noise from the
camcorder’s motor. In addition, they always point in one direction and that
direction might not be close enough to the sound you want to capture.
• Consider using more than one mic. Depending on your video equipment, there
are a few ways to use more than one mic on a shoot. You can plug two mics into
your camcorder so they both record perfectly synced sound. That lets you posi-
tion the mics in different locations—one for each person in a scene, for example.
If you can’t plug two mics into your camera, you can use a separate recorder to
capture sound while you shoot (though you’ll need to take steps to synchronize
this sound with the picture; more on that in the box on page 293).
• Consider sound effects. If you can’t capture the sound you want while the camera
is rolling, consider recording sound effects independently. You can record vital
sounds, like the slam of a door or the rattle of a tin can, on your own time and
add them to your movie later. You can even use your camcorder to record that
sound (just delete the video track when you import the clip into your timeline).
Alternatively, you can capture sound effects on a separate audio recorder (see
the note on page 302 for more on audio-only recorders).
• Plan your “synced sound” and your “non-synced” sound. You’ve probably
seen cheesy movies where the movement of characters’ lips doesn’t match the
dialog, and the results always make you laugh. Your camcorder records sound
in sync with the image, so you don’t need to worry about that (unless you delib-
erately unlink the audio and video tracks as you edit, as described on page 303).
But if you use an independent sound recorder, you need to sync your sound to
the video, as described in the box on page 293. If you know you’re going to
record non-synced sound, you need to plan ahead.
• Eliminate background noise. The person responsible for sound may be you, a
one-person video crew, or an actor not in the current scene. Whatever the case,
before a shoot, the person who records your audio should listen carefully for
sources of unwanted noise and eliminate them. Noise from outside traffic?

Chapter 10: Edit Your Sound Track
293
Design Sound from
the Start
Close a couple of windows. Sound of the dishwasher running? Turn it off.
Phones? Turn ’em off, too.
In a perfect world, sound designers listen to the audio they record after every
take to make sure they captured the best possible audio. If you’re in a room that
produces a lot of boomy echoes, you may want to drape blankets over the outside-
of-frame walls to keep the sound from bouncing around. And as mentioned
earlier, one of the best ways to eliminate unwanted noise is to get the mic close
to the sound you want.
• Consider multiple takes. Sure, if you’re shooting a wedding or a birthday party
or some other event that occurs only once in the real world, you can’t do a sec-
ond take. In many other instances, however, you can. For example, if you shoot
an interview or training video, you can usually call for another take if the light-
ing’s bad. You should be equally prepared to do multiple takes if the sound isn’t
clear. If you take the time to watch a scene after you shoot it, you should listen
to the playback through a set of headphones.
SOUND ADVICE
Sync Sound Recorded Separately
When you watch one of those old-time movies about mak-
ing movies, someone always yells “Quiet on the set.” That’s
followed by the command “Roll film” and the response
“Rolling.” Then, some production assistant clacks a slate. In
those old films, the slate was like a mini-chalkboard, with a
hinged arm on the top that would come down with an audi-
ble “thwack.” The board included the name of the movie,
scene, and take. The purpose of the whole slate exercise
was to identify a common point in both the picture and the
sound. That way, the editor could synchronize the film with
the recording tape. At least, that’s the way it was in the old
days. When you shoot with your camcorder today, the cam-
era records the picture and sound together and timestamps
both.
But if you capture sound on an independent recorder, it’s
up to you to synchronize the sound and picture. For short,
obvious sounds, like a door closing or a thunder clap, it’s
pretty easy to find the frame where you want to drop the
audio in your timeline. Usually, the toughest thing to sync
is conversation, especially when you can see the characters’
lips. The solution is to “slate” your video clips whenever you
start and stop the camera and the recorder. You can actu-
ally buy a film slate for the job, or you can slate your films
the low-rent way: Have someone stand in front of the cam-
era with their arms outstretched. Once you get the camera
and sound rolling, have them bring their arms together to
make a loud clap. When you edit your film in Premiere, you
align the frame where the hands meet with the sound of
the clap on the audio track. In fact, you probably want to
place a marker in the timeline called “slate.” (For details on
creating timeline markers, see page 170.)
If you want to take slating to the next step, visually identify
the scene and take (a large chalkboard or piece of paper or
cardboard can do the trick). Repeat the same identifying
words for the sound recorder.
In the hubbub of a shoot, it’s easy to forget to slate a shot—
especially if it’s not something you do on every shot. If you
remember before you finish up your shot, you can “back-
slate” it. That is, do the slate routine at the end of the shot
rather than the beginning. It’s not quite as handy as having
all that info at the beginning of a clip, but it does the job.

Build a Soundtrack
Build a Soundtrack
Drag a video clip to the timeline, and a sound track goes along with it in most
cases. The timeline displays both the video and audio track. For example,
Figure 10-1 shows a video clip on Video 1 and a linked audio clip on Audio 1. In
the soundtrack, waveforms represent the relative volume in the clip. Once you get
a feel for waveforms, you can use their bumps and squiggles to identify points in
your soundtrack without having to listen to every moment in a clip.
Tip: While you can work with audio in the sceneline, in many ways it’s easier to understand what’s going
on in the timeline. For example, if you try to synchronize a sound effect with a particular event in your
movie, the timeline is definitely the way to go because it gives you precise, frame-by-frame control. So this
chapter uses the Timeline view for most examples.
Use Multiple Audio Tracks
When you first fire up Premiere, the empty timeline shows tracks labeled Video 1
and Audio 1. Scroll up in the timeline, and you see a couple more linked tracks,
numbered 2 and 3. Premiere automatically provides these tracks on the assumption
that, at least in some cases, you’ll layer images and sounds to enhance your film.
Some of those sounds will be sound effects. Sound effects come in different shapes
and sizes. A car crash or gunshot take just a moment, but the sound of waves
crashing on-shore or birds chattering in the jungle might run through an entire
scene. Your job as sound designer is to make sure the sounds occur at just the right
moment and, in the final mix, at just the right volume, especially in relationship to
other sounds. Placing sound effects in individual tracks gives you the ability to
fine-tune each of your movie’s audio components independently.
Note: For a full discussion of recording and importing sound effects, see page 73 in Chapter 3.

Build a Soundtrack
Premiere isn’t stingy about additional tracks. You can add as many as you like,
which is handy if you’re adding multiple sound effects.
Think about a scene with two people walking the mean streets of a big city. You
capture their voices as they walk, so that’s on Audio 1. You have music on the
“Soundtrack” track and Narration on its eponymous track. But you also want to
give the scene some atmosphere, some of that constant background rumble of a
city. The audience will notice if it’s missing. So you record cars going up and down
the street and voices from the crowded sidewalks and storefronts. Occasionally,
there’s a car honking or a cabby cursing. A bus stops and opens its door. The
driver urges someone to hurry off. All these sounds have a place on your timeline.
Some should be subtle background sounds and others, like your actors’ voices,
need to be in the foreground. Put the clips on different tracks, as shown in
Figure 10-2, and you can adjust the volume and timing for each of the tracks.
Figure 10-2:

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Build a Soundtrack
Below the Audio 1 track, Premiere provides two additional, special-purpose audio
tracks, called Soundtrack and Narration. Figure 10-3 shows what the timeline
looks like after you fill these tracks with clips. You drop background music in the
track labeled “Soundtrack”. Like narration, music communicates with your audi-
ence—its emotion and tempo have a remarkable effect on viewers. Your choice of
music can also say something about your movie’s time period or season. Tips for
adding music to your Soundtrack start on page 308.
By narrating a movie, you can give your audience lots of information they may not
glean from the images. Done well, narration adds to the mood of a movie. Narra-
tion can be nostalgic (A Christmas Story) or ominous (Apocalypse Now). You’ll
find more on recording narration on page 81.
Trim and Split Audio Clips
Once you put audio clips in the timeline, you can trim them just as you would a
video clip; by dragging one or both of the ends. If you want to split a clip into sepa-
rate parts, drag the playhead to the point where you want the split and then press
Ctrl+K or click the Split Clip button (the scissors icon) at the bottom right of the
monitor.
Cut, Copy, Paste, and Clear Clips
You have all the usual editing suspects at your disposal for editing audio tracks.
For example, if you want to duplicate a clip that’s already in the timeline, select it
and press Ctrl+C (Copy). Move the playhead to the destination and then press
Ctrl+V (Paste). In addition to these keyboard shortcuts, you can see a list of edit-
ing commands by right-clicking a clip in the timeline. At the top of the shortcut
menu, you see commands like the ones shown in Figure 10-4.

Remove Unused Tracks
If you need to add a lot of audio tracks to a timeline, you end up with a bunch of
unused video tracks, too. That’s because, when you use Premiere’s Add Tracks
command (right-click an empty part of the timeline and choose Add Tracks from
the shortcut menu), it adds tracks in pairs, one for audio and one for video. It’s
easy to remove all those unused tracks at once. Right-click on an empty spot in the
timeline and then choose Delete Empty Tracks from the shortcut menu. Premiere
cleans up the timeline. Don’t worry, you can always add new audio and video
tracks as needed. To create new tracks, drag a clip to the top part of the timeline—
that space between the topmost clip and the ruler—or right-click an empty place
in the timeline and then choose Add Tracks from the shortcut menu.
Tip: If you need to add several audio tracks at once, choose Timeline ➝Add Tracks. A window opens
where you can specify how many video or audio tracks you want to add. Use the Placement menu to
position the tracks. Numbered tracks start with “1” at the bottom, so if you choose After Last Track, your
new tracks appear at the top of the timeline.

Preview Audio Clips
You may want to listen to your audio before you add it to the timeline, and as you
build multiple tracks in the timeline, you’ll want to listen to the combined effect,
too. You can preview audio clips just as you would video clips:
1. Go to Window ➝ Available Media.
The Tasks panel displays the media for your project, including video and
audio clips.
2. Double-click a clip.
Premiere’s Preview window opens. If you double-click a clip that has audio and
video linked, you see the video image in the window. If it’s an audio-only clip,
you see a waveform like the one in Figure 10-5.
3. Click the Play button.
You’ve got all the standard controls to navigate and preview your clip.
4. If necessary, adjust the In and Out points for the clip.
You can drag the In and Out markers or position the playhead and click the Set
In and Set Out buttons. Once you set In and Out points, you can jump from
one to another by right-clicking in the Preview window and then choosing Go
to Clip Marker ➝ In (or Out).
5. Drag the clip from the Preview window to the timeline.
The trimmed clip appears in the timeline. Some clips, like the audio for a car
horn, may not be synced to a video clip. You can control those clips’ timing by
moving them up and down the timeline.

Preview Layered Audio
You design the sound for your movie by layering audio clips. For big projects, you
usually have some audio tracks linked to video clips and some unlinked. To pre-
view the combined effect of the audio tracks, click somewhere in the timeline and
then press the space bar. All the audio clips (as well as any video clips) play back.
Watch the playhead’s red line as it passes over the soundtrack to get a feel for the
way the waveform represents the recorded sounds. Larger waves indicate louder
sounds.
What are you looking and listening for as you design your sound? Volume and
clarity are the two most important qualities. Just like your video image, which you
can overexpose or underexpose, you may record your sound at too high or too low
a volume.
Keep in mind that, at this point, you want to focus on the volume of the initial
recording—this is a sound-quality issue, which is different from how loud the clip
will be in your final movie. Many camcorders automatically control the audio vol-
ume as they record. Sometimes, that provides the results you want, and sometimes
it doesn’t.
To see your recording displayed using the standard scale for audio (where sound is
measured in decibels), go to Window ➝Audio Meters. The Audio Meters (shown
in Figure 10-6) give you information about the quality of your recording. As the
sound plays, you see the green bars jump up and down. Little gold lines sit at the
top of the bar. And each time the green bar reaches a new height, the gold line
marks the spot. At the end of the clip, that line represents the peak volume for the
track.
Ideally, you want that peak volume to be between –6dB (decibels) and 0. If your
audio falls in this sweet spot, you’ll see gold lines in the meter. If your peak falls
below –6dB (too low a volume), green lines mark the peak. And if the peak goes
above 0dB, the boxes above the scale turn red, which means you recorded the sound
at too high a volume, causing distortion. We’re not talking cool Jimi Hendrix or
White Stripes distortion here—digital audio distortion is usually unpleasant.
Figure 10-6:
Go to Window ➝ Audio Meters to display this little guy. As you preview
your clip, the green lines indicate the volume of recorded sound. The
gold lines show the peak volume of the audio. If the meters hit the box
above the 0 line that means the audio is distorted.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

Tip: There aren’t many great fixes for really unpleasant digital distortion. If possible, you should try to re-
record the clip. Alternatively, you can try to edit out the offending noise (see page 303).
Disable (Mute) Timeline Tracks
After you add several tracks to the timeline, you may want to hear some of those
tracks with the other ones turned off. You can enable and disable audio or video
clips in the timeline. If you disable a video clip, it doesn’t play back in the moni-
tor. If you disable an audio clip, you won’t hear it when you preview your movie.
Premiere automatically enables clips when you add them to the timeline. To dis-
able a clip, right-click it. The shortcut menu pops up, and you see a checkmark
next to the Enable command, as shown in Figure 10-7. Click Enable, and the
checkmark disappears. When you want to put the clip back in action, toggle
Enable back on.
Fix Poorly Recorded Audio
If you record your soundtrack at too low a volume, its waveform looks flat, and the
audio meter’s lines (Window ➝Audio Meters) will never pass the –6dB mark. If
you record the audio at too high a volume, the waveform gets cut off at the top of
Figure 10-7:
You can enable and disable each
audio and video clip in the
timeline. When you don’t want to
hear an audio clip, use the

the audio track (as in Figure 10-8). In the audio meters, the levels hit the ceiling,
leaving red marks in the small boxes at the top of the meters.
To fix audio problems, follow these steps:
1. In the timeline, right-click the clip and then choose Audio Gain.
The Clip Gain panel opens, as shown in Figure 10-9.
2. Click the Normalize button and then click OK.
Premiere adjusts the gain (volume) so that the quietest parts of a clip are
louder, and the too-loud parts are quieter. The Clip Gain panel closes and the
waveform takes on a new shape.
3. Review the changes by playing back the audio.
It’s a good idea to listen to the entire clip after you normalize it. You may or
may not be happy with the changes. If you’re not, press Ctrl+Z (or click Undo
in the menu bar at the top of the screen) to undo it.
Figure 10-8:
Tracks recorded at too high a volume show flat spots
instead of nice, curved waveforms, as shown here.

Figure 10-9:
You can try to fix poorly recorded audio automatically by clicking the Normalize
button in the Clip Gain window shown here. If you’re not happy with the results,
you can try to fix it manually by changing the dB (decibel) number. Type in a
negative value, like –1.5, to reduce the volume or a positive value to increase it.

Remove Noise from Analog Recordings
These days, you should record your audio with digital equipment (instead of old
analog cassette-based recorders, for example). Analog recordings pick up back-
ground hiss, and, what’s worse, each time you copy an analog recording (such as
when you import it into Premiere), the embedded background noise becomes
more pronounced. What’s more, your camcorder records crisp digital audio, so
mixing the two types of recording gives you unsatisfying results. If you use a sepa-
rate recorder for sound, you can find a variety of digital recorders from companies
like Alesis, Sony, Tascam, and Zoom.
That said, if you’ve got a noisy analog recording you have to use, Premiere can help
remove some of the background hiss. It’s an audio effect called, appropriately
enough, the DeNoiser. Here’s how it works: Analog background noise is lower in
volume than the foreground sound you actually want. Using the DeNoiser, you set
what’s called a NoiseFloor, another way of saying you remove sounds on an audio
track that fall below a certain level, a level the DeNoiser sets.
1. Go Window ➝ Effects and then type DeNoiser in the Search box.
2. Drag DeNoiser onto the offending audio clip.
Adobe designed the DeNoiser to automatically find and remove noise from your
clips. You should notice a difference when you listen to the clip.
If you think the DeNoiser needs some human intervention, click the Properties
button above the timeline. In the Tasks panel, open the DeNoiser effect and choose
Custom Setup. Then, adjust the controls that identify noise in your clip (see
Figure 10-10). Click Custom Setup and then, at the bottom-left of the Properties
window, click “Play only the audio for this clip”.
The DeNoiser graphs your audio in its own little monitor. It displays the Noise-
Floor setting as a green line during playback, and as a numeric value in decibels
(dB) just below the monitor window. Change the Reduction setting to increase or
decrease the amount of noise the DeNoiser removes. The Offset value represents a
range between the sound you want to get rid of and the sound you want to keep.
You can manually adjust that number, too. The Freeze checkbox locks the Noise-
Floor to the current value; when you check it, the DeNoiser stops automatically
adjusting the NoiseFloor.
Note: Most digital audio recorders save your audio on memory cards, but you can find recorders that
store it on CDs or MiniDiscs. There’s nothing wrong with using these recorders, it’s just that the newer
memory-based recorders are a little easier to use; CD recorders are bigger and slower. Mini-discs use
great technology developed by Sony, but they never caught on with the general public.

Chapter 10: Edit Your Sound Track

Separate Audio and Video Tracks
Sometimes, you may only be interested in the audio portion of a camcorder clip,
or you may use your camcorder as a sound recorder at one point when you don’t
need the video and just want the sound. After you drop the clip in the timeline,
right-click it and then choose Delete Video from the shortcut menu. The video clip
disappears and the audio track remains. (You can do the opposite, too—delete the
audio track and keep the picture. Just choose Delete Audio from the shortcut
menu.) This only affects the instance of the clip in the timeline; your original clip
(which you can see in the Media panel and the Organizer) remains unaffected—it
still has both audio and video tracks.
What if you want to edit an audio track separately from the video track? Perhaps
you want to cut out an annoying bit of distortion or a sound that shouldn’t be
there. You want to keep the picture, but you want to delete a chunk of the audio
track, too. That, of course, will make the clips unequal. Here’s what you do:
1. Select the clip in the timeline and then go to Clip ➝ Unlink Audio and Video.
Premiere unlinks the two clips. At this point, you can select each separately.
Figure 10-10:
The DeNoiser audio effect removes hum
and hiss from analog recordings. The
effect’s controls even have a retro-
tech look.

2. Drag the playhead to the point were the offending noise begins and then press
Ctrl+K or click the Split Clip button (the scissors) in the lower-right corner of
the monitor.
Note that this splits both the audio and video clips.
3. Click the right-hand edge of the audio clip and then drag the edge to the right.
Dragging the edge trims the clip, letting you trim out the distortion.
4. Move the playhead before the edited audio and press Space.
Listen to make sure you removed the offending noise. You can re-trim the
audio clip if necessary.
When you play the clip, the poor-sounding audio portion is missing, as shown in
Figure 10-11.
Tip: Another, even easier way to eliminate sound in the middle of a clip is to set beginning and ending
audio keyframes and then reduce the volume in between the two. Figure 10-12 shows you this technique
in action.
Linked but Not Synced
Most of the time, when video and audio tracks are linked to each other, you want
them to play in sync, so that the sounds and the pictures match up. If you want to
use the sound separately, you unlink the tracks as described on page 303. For those
rare occasions when you want the tracks linked but you want to shift the sound,
hold down the Alt key and drag the audio track. As the audio track moves, the
video stays put, as shown in Figure 10-13, and a tooltip displays the time differ-
ence between the two tracks. When audio and video are out of sync, you see a red
Figure 10-11:
Here, a portion of the
audio track was removed

noise. First, the audio and

unlinked, making it
possible to delete a chunk
of the audio track without
affecting the video.

tag with numbers in the upper-right corner of the clip. After you move the clips
out of sync, Premiere still keeps them linked. Drag the audio or video part of the
clip and both move together. If you want to put them back in sync, Alt-drag either
the audio or video until the numbers in the red tags disappear.
Adjust Volume and Balance
All audio clips have two fixed effects: Volume and Balance. To see them, select a
clip and then click the Properties button (see Figure 10-14). Volume is expressed
in decibels, with 0.0 dB representing the volume at which you recorded the clip.
Use the slider to increase or decrease the volume of the entire clip. To modify the
volume at different points in time, use keyframes, which let you specify the value
for Volume. Simply put, you can set the volume low at one point in a clip and high
at another point. Then Premiere automatically sets the volume between those two
points so that it gradually increases. There are a lot more details on using key-
frames with effects on page 239. That discussion focuses on visual effects, but the
concepts apply to audio effects, too.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Add Audio Effects
Often, you want sound to gradually increase (or fade in) at the beginning of a clip
and gradually decrease (fade out) at the end. The Volume effect has two handy
buttons that do just that automatically. If you click Fade In, Premiere automati-
cally creates a keyframe at the beginning of a clip with the volume set low. At the
end of the fade-in, it sets a second keyframe with the volume at the normal, or
recorded, level. You can see the results in Figure 10-15. If you click the Fade Out
button, Premiere mirrors these settings at the end of a clip.
Premiere’s Balance effect works just like it does on your home theater system or
car stereo. You use Balance to send sound to the left or right speaker. This is par-
ticularly effective in video, because it gives you an opportunity to direct the sound
so that it matches an image. For example, if your characters walk along a sidewalk
on the right side of the screen while a car goes by on the left, you want the sound of
their footsteps to come from the right speaker and the sound of the car to come
from the left speaker. Use the Balance slider to direct the sound in each of these
clips to different speakers. As with Volume, you can adjust an entire clip or you
can set keyframes to change the balance over the course of a clip.
Add Audio Effects
Premiere comes with a bunch of audio effects. Not to be confused with recorded
sound effects, these effects alter your recordings. Volume and Balance, discussed in
the previous section, are fixed effects that are part of every audio clip. Other effects
change the way a clip sounds. For example, the Delay effect adds an echo to an
audio clip. The DeNoiser effect, discussed on page 302, removes hiss and hum
from an analog recording.
You apply effects by dragging them onto an audio clip. You can make adjustments
to the effects in the Properties panel (Window ➝ Properties).
Figure 10-14:
Volume and Balance are fixed audio
effects—that means they’re present in
the Properties settings for every
audio clip.

Chapter 10: Edit Your Sound Track
307
Add Audio Effects
Tip: Most of Premiere’s audio effects include a Bypass option, where you can click the Bypass checkbox
to temporarily disable the effect. This gives you an easy way to compare a clip with and without an effect.
Here’s a brief introduction to some of Premiere’s other sound effects:
• Bass and Treble boost either the low (bass) or high notes (treble) in a clip.
Works just like your car stereo.
• Channel Volume lets you control the volume for the right and left speakers
independently. Unlike the Balance effect, increasing the volume of one channel
doesn’t automatically reduce the volume in the other.
• Delay adds an echo effect to a clip. You can control the timing of the echo and
mix it with the original sound.
• Dynamics works kind of like the DeNoiser described on page 302, but Dynam-
ics removes noise from digital audio rather than from analog audio. To remove
low-volume noise, set AutoGate to a specific decibel value. The Limiter sets the
maximum level for sound—if a sound exceeds the limit you set here, Dynamics
doesn’t eliminate it, it just reduces the sound to the maximum level.
Use the Compressor to increase soft sounds and reduce loud ones. Sound engi-
neers often use this effect when recording voices. If you don’t overuse it, the
result is a smoother, but still natural, sound. Expander reduces all signals below
a certain threshold to a ratio you specify. The effect is similar to AutoGate, but
Expander gives you more settings, so you can fine-tune the effect a little better.
• Fill Left and Fill Right copy one stereo audio track to the other. Fill Left, for
example, copies the sound in the left track to the right track (Premiere dumps
the sound previously in the right track). This effect comes in handy when you
have a monaural clip and you want the sound to come out of both the left and
right speakers of a stereo setup.
Figure 10-15:
The yellow graph line displays the volume for
this clip. A keyframe at the beginning of the clip
sets the volume low. The second keyframe
brings the volume up to the normal, recorded
level (0.0 dB). You can create your own
keyframes to control volume and other
audio effects.

Add a Music Track
• Highpass and Lowpass filter specific frequencies out of a sound clip. For example,
apply the Lowpass filter to a clip, and it lets the low frequencies pass through
while removing those high-pitched frequencies that make your dog put her
paws over her ears.
• Invert changes the “phase” of the sound channels. Sometimes, if you record the
same event with two different devices and play both recordings at the same
time, the waveforms have a way of canceling each other out, resulting in weak
or lifeless sound. The Invert effect helps by coordinating the two recordings.
• Notch removes certain frequencies, similar to the Highpass and Lowpass filters.
Those filters remove sound from the ends of the sound spectrum, while Notch
removes it from the middle.
• PitchShifter adjusts a sound’s pitch without changing the timing of a clip. Create
your own chipmunks.
• Reverb adds what audio technicians call “ambiance.” Using these settings, you
can make a recording sound as though you recorded it in a cathedral—or a
phone booth.
• Swap Channels—you guessed it, the right and left channels do a do-si-do.
Add a Music Track
You may need to use the scroll bar on the right of the timeline to see the
Soundtrack tucked away at the bottom of your timeline. You can put any audio
clip you want in this track, but its intended purpose is for music. Drag a music clip
(to which you have attained all legal rights from parties of the first part) to the
Soundtrack. You can adjust the volume and balance as explained on page 305, and
the Volume property’s Fade In and Fade Out effects are particularly handy for
music tracks (page 306).
You can use any of the audio editing techniques or special effects discussed here on
your music track, but there’s one special trick that’s unique to music tracks. You
can have Premiere analyze the audio and place markers in the timeline that match
the beat of the music. Then you can edit your video to the beat of its soundtrack—
that is, position your cuts and transitions to match the beat of the soundtrack. It’s
very effective, as you know if you’ve ever watched MTV.
Select an audio clip in the timeline and then choose one of three ways to get Pre-
miere to analyze the clip:
• Select Detect Beats from the Audio Tools menu (Figure 10-17) in the upper-
right corner of the timeline.
• Right-click a clip in the timeline and choose Beat Detect from the shortcut
menu.
• Select a clip and choose Clip ➝ Beat Detect.

Chapter 10: Edit Your Sound Track
309
Mix the Audio Track
No matter how you get there, you see the Detect Beat Settings panel
(Figure 10-16), where you can fine-tune the detection process. It’s probably best to
use the initial settings first, and then, if necessary, go ahead and make adjust-
ments, as indicated in Figure 10-16.
Once Premiere detects the beats in your sound clip, it identifies them with cheery
little musical-note markers in the timeline (see Figure 10-17).
Mix the Audio Track
Sound mixing is serious work. It’s more easily done on a physical mixing board
than it is on a computer screen using a mouse. And even then, it helps if you have
as many hands as an octopus has tentacles. The concept is this: As your movie and
multiple soundtracks play, adjust the level sliders for each track so that the sounds
you want in the foreground have the proper volume and the sounds you want in
the background don’t distract. Everything needs to be balanced just right, but
sometimes, when you change one level, it seems to discombobulate the others.
Figure 10-16:
Use the “Minimum time between beats” setting to make sure
the detector doesn’t become too staccato. As the helpful note
in the panel explains: Increase the Difference settings to
identify beats that are louder than the rest of the clip. Increase
the Window value to make that comparison over a wider
range of time.
Figure 10-17:
Beat markers look like musical notes, so it’s easy to
tell them apart from regular timeline markers. You
can find the Detect Beats command in the Audio
Tools menu.

Mix the Audio Track
Mix the Level or Balance
You can change the level (volume) or balance for an entire clip or for just a single
clip. As mentioned on page 305, Volume and Balance are both fixed effects. That
means they’re properties of every audio clip, and you can view them in the Proper-
ties panel (Window ➝ Properties).
The Audio Mixer (Figure 10-18) lets you adjust Volume and Balance, but it oper-
ates on entire tracks as opposed to an individual clip. In fact, it includes settings
labeled Audio 1, Narration, and Soundtrack. If you add a second audio track,
Audio Mixer displays a set of Audio 2 control buttons, too, and so on. (If you’ve
used Digidesign’s ProTools, Adobe’s Soundbooth, or a hardware mixing board, the
controls will look familiar.)
Each track has a level meter, a level slider, a balance control, and a mute checkbox.
When a track’s level is set to 0.0, the track’s volume is unchanged from the origi-
nal recording. A positive number makes it louder than the original and a negative
number makes it quieter. When you set the Balance to 0.0, it, too, is unchanged
from the original recording. Turn the dial, and you can shift the balance from one
channel to the other.
Automate Sound Mixing with SmartMixer
Premiere offers one quick-and-easy way to mix your sound, which just may work for
some of your projects. It’s called SmartMixer, and it uses Premiere’s AutoAnalyzer to
examine the audio clips in your timeline. It knows the difference between voice-
over in the Narration track and music in the Soundtrack, and it automatically
adjusts the levels so that it lowers the music when people talk. When there aren’t
any voices, the music comes up a bit.
Give SmartMixer a few moments to do its analysis and you might be able to save
yourself a lot of time. Even if you’re not 100 percent happy with the results, you
can go in and make changes after SmartMixer does its thing.
LOLA’S BIG SPLASH PROJECT
Edit the Soundtrack
If you’re editing the “Lola’s Big Splash” project, this is a
good time to edit the soundtrack. In the first clip showing
the house there’s some wind noise. See if you can remove
it. Here are some audio techniques you can practice once
you add the music clip 01 Nobody Knows.mp3 from the
Project panel to the soundtrack in the timeline:
1. Select the clip and then choose Audio Tools ➝
Detect Beats.
2. Adjust some of the cuts to match the beat in the
music.
3. Manually, adjust the volume and balance, or…
4. Use SmartMix to automatically adjust the soundtrack
volume.

Mix the Audio Track
SmartMixer assumes that you want certain audio tracks, including Narration and
Audio 1, linked to Video 1 clips, and that these tracks take precedence over any
other audio tracks. At the same time, it assumes that music on the Soundtrack and
audio tracks above Audio 1 are secondary and should be in the background of the
mix. If your sound design doesn’t work that way, you can change the general
guidelines before you fire up SmartMix. Click the timeline’s Audio Tools menu
and then choose SmartMix ➝Options. The SmartMixer panel opens, where you
can choose which tracks should be foreground and which should be background,
as shown in Figure 10-19.
To have SmartMix analyze and automatically mix the audio levels for your project,
click the timeline’s Audio Tools menu (in the upper-right corner), and then
choose SmartMix ➝ Apply.

Manual Sound-Mixing with the Audio Mixer
If you want to mix your audio manually, start with the most important tracks.
That’s probably the sound that’s linked to your video clips. If necessary, mute
some of the tracks so you can focus on the first track you mix. Position the play-
head at the beginning of a clip and then press the space bar or hit the Play button.
Make adjustments to the Level and Volume controls as the audio plays. Premiere
automatically creates keyframes that save the Level and Balance values when you
make changes in the Audio Mixer. It only records changes to the Level and Bal-
ance controls as you play back your audio—if you stop playback and change the
controls, Premiere pays no attention.
When you finish, you probably want to listen to the track one more time and make
final adjustments. You can do that in the mixer, or you can manually make
changes to the keyframes.
Once you finish mixing the first track, it’s time to tackle the next one. This go-
round, pick the next-most-important track and don’t mute the track you just fine-
tuned. Repeat this process until you work your way through all the tracks in your
project.
Mixing audio is an art, and there are plenty of folks who spend their whole career
learning how to do it for movies and music production. So be patient and take
your time as you mix. Don’t be afraid to go back over tracks you already mixed
and make adjustments. It’s all part of the sound-design process.
Tip: If your screen space is limited, you can show and hide Audio Mixer’s track controls. Click the panel

Choose a Video Format
Once you edit your video and polish it up with transitions, effects, and a great
soundtrack, it’s time to share it. So how are you going to show your epic to family,
friends, and neighbors? That’s the subject of the remaining chapters in this book.
This chapter explores the mysteries of video files. You’ll learn the different options
for saving your film. You can create a finished video and save it to DVD, upload it
to a video-sharing site like YouTube, export it to a mobile device like an iPhone or
an iPod Touch, or save it and play it back on your PC.
This chapter introduces these options and describes why Premiere creates differ-
ent files for different destinations. Then, in Chapters 12, 13, and 14, you’ll learn
the details for publishing your film on each of these devices and on the Web.
Video Formats and Premiere Elements
In broad strokes, the steps you take to create and share a movie are as follows (see
Figure 11-1):
1. You and your camcorder produce a bunch of clips.
2. You store that bunch of clips (video, audio, and still images) on your computer.
3. With the help of Premiere, you assemble those clips into a movie with lots of
snazzy effects and a soundtrack.
4. Premiere exports your edited movie in different formats, each designed to
match a display device. This process is known as “encoding” or “rendering”
your movie (though this rendering is different from the on-the-fly rendering
Premiere does as you edit your movie).

316
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Video Formats and
Premiere Elements
What Comes In
Your camcorder produces video clips in a specific digital format, but you’re not
limited to that format when it’s time to share your movie. In fact, you shouldn’t use
the same format for every destination: DVD, YouTube, iPhone, and the file you
email to Grandma should each have a different file format.
You made one decision about video formats when you bought your video camera.
As the friendly salesperson probably explained, different camcorders record video
in different formats. If you have an older, tape-based DV camcorder, Premiere
captures your video clips and saves them to your computer in the AVI format (for
a review of the different video file formats, see page 380). If you have one of the
newer high-definition camcorders, Premiere may save your video in MTS format.
In fact, Premiere is great at reading and understanding all the common video file
formats, so you don’t have to worry about how your camcorder stores video.
There’s one camcorder characteristic that significantly affects the video you create,
however, and that’s aspect ratio.
Camcorder aspect ratio
Aspect ratio, in simple terms, is the shape—the width and the height—of your
movie’s playback window.
Here’s an easy way to think of aspect ratio: Remember when everybody had TVs
that were nearly square in shape. Those TVs had an aspect ratio of 4:3, meaning
that, for every 4 horizontal inches your TV screen had, it had 3 vertical inches.
Nowadays, TVs are shaped like the movie screens you see in theaters. Today’s TVs,
just like those movie screens, have an aspect ratio of 16:9.

Video Formats and
Premiere Elements
Like television sets, camcorders, too, have evolved. If you have an older model
camcorder, it probably shoots video in the 4:3 aspect ratio. If you have a new high-
def model, it shoots in the 16:9 ratio. (A few cameras can shoot both.)
Tip: When you choose a preset for importing or exporting video, Premiere refers to video that’s in the
16:9 aspect ratio as “widescreen.” In some cases, it refers to video in the 4:3 format as “standard.” In other
cases, Premiere never specifies a format or doesn’t let you select one. In those cases, the aspect ratio is
probably the standard 4:3.
The shape of the video images in your raw clips is important to know, because if
you change that shape when you export your finished movie—if you use a differ-
ent aspect ratio, in other words—you’ll end up with cartoon-like distortions—
heads that look like footballs, for example, or dachshunds that look like mastiffs.
You told Premiere what your camcorder’s aspect ratio is when you imported your
clips—that’s why you chose a camcorder type when you filled out Premiere’s New
Projects screen at the beginning of your project (see page 23). For example, if you
have an AVCHD camcorder, you chose an AVCHD setting in Premiere’s New
Project window. Once you did that, Premiere knew how to handle your raw video,
audio clips, and still images when you imported them.
It’s just as important that you tell Premiere what aspect ratio to use when it exports
your file—when it creates your final film. Fortunately, just as Premiere prompted
you with a list of predefined specifications when it imported your files, it does the
same thing when you create your final film file, except this time it lets you select
from a list of destination devices instead of source devices.
What Goes Out
How and where will people view your video? That’s the question you need to
answer before you can save and share your movie. Put another way, the answer to
that question determines the format you want for your final movie file to be in.
Are you going to show it to friends on your brand-new, high-def TV? Are you
going to upload it to YouTube? Are you showing it off on an iPod at lunch or
sending it out via email?
The good news is that you can do all of these things. In fact, you can save copies for
each of these situations; just tell Premiere what you want. That copy for your high-
def TV gets saved as a high-resolution (1920 × 1080 pixels) video, while the copy
you email gets scrunched down to low resolution (maybe as small as 320×240 pixels).
In terms of file size, the video for your high-definition TV will be huge, but it looks
great. The one you email doesn’t look as sharp, but it emails quickly and won’t
clog up someone’s inbox.
Note: The term pixel is a contraction of “picture” and “element.” Think of it as a little dot on your TV
screen or computer monitor (though it’s actually a tiny square or rectangle).

Why So Many
Formats?
Now, here’s the really, really good news: When it comes time to export your video,
you don’t have to sweat the details. Premiere anticipates just about every destina-
tion for your movie (DVD, website, Sony PSP, and so on) and lists them in plain
English (Figure 11-2). You simply choose the device and Premiere spits out the
proper file.
If your video is headed to YouTube, for example, you choose “YouTube” from
Premiere’s Share tab. The program then applies the proper settings and creates a
video file perfectly suited to the file-sharing service. Behind the scenes, Premiere
has set the right technical specifications (compression level, frame size, number of
frames per minute, and so on) for YouTube (Premiere calls these predefined speci-
fications “presets”).
Why So Many Formats?
At this point in our program, you may be scratching your head wondering why
there are so many video formats to begin with. It’s all about size and speed. As you
know by now, video files are huge. That’s not a problem when you store all of a
movie’s 1s and 0s on a Blu-ray disc, but it is an issue when you want to play it back
over the Web or tuck a video into an email message. That Blu-ray disc can play
your movie in all its glory, while the video you send over the Internet needs to be
squashed down to a smaller file size.
Figure 11-2:
At the first stop on the Share tab, you choose
the destination for your video: DVD, online,
a computer, a mobile device, or a DV or
HDV tape.

Chapter 11: Choose a Video Format

Why So Many
Formats?
How do the video wizards come up with ways to make video files smaller? They
use some pretty ingenious techniques. Even so, in most cases, the tradeoff is almost
always the same: If you want great video quality, you’ve got to deal with big files. If
you want a smaller file, you’ve got to sacrifice video and audio quality. The trick is
to find the right balance.
While you don’t have to worry about the nitty-gritty technical details when you
choose a preset from Premiere’s Share tab, it helps to know how Premiere shrinks
your video files for different media—and it almost always shrinks files. Except for
high-definition video formats like Blu-ray discs or DVDs, Premiere usually needs
to make your video more compact. Here’s how it does that. It:
• Lowers the resolution. Each video frame is made up of a grid of pixels. The
number of pixels used to create an image is called its resolution. When Premiere
knows a video is destined for an iPod, it uses a resolution of 640 pixels × 480
pixels (640 × 480). If a video is destined for a Blu-ray disc connected to a high-
definition TV, Premiere uses a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels.
• Reduces the picture data in each frame. Each frame of your move is essentially
the same thing as a still photo. Premiere reduces file size by using techniques
like those used to compact still photos—instead of defining the color for every
single pixel in an image, Premiere uses a standardized shorthand to define large
and repeating areas in an image.
• Reduces the picture data from one frame to another. With most video, only a
portion of an image changes from frame to frame. Think of a long shot of a
train moving through a mountain pass. The train moves, but everything else
stays the same. One compression technique Premiere uses for video files is to
update only the portion of the image that changes. The unchanged portion
doesn’t need to be stored in the video file again. Premiere can simply reference
it: “Use the sky and mountain range from Frame 15 in this frame.”
• Reduces the frame rate. In a movie theater, you see 24 frames of video every
second. That’s fast enough to fool your eye and brain into thinking you’re seeing
nice fluid movement rather than a bunch of still pictures. In a pinch, Premiere
can reduce a video’s file size by reducing the number of frames it displays per
second (fps). So, if you choose one of the presets for email, Premiere may set
the frame rate to 15 fps or even 10 fps.
It may seem like there are a bewildering number of ways to shrink video files and a
bewildering number of video standards. But there are standards. The folks who
manage the YouTube site expect you to send video using their standard, while the
folks who developed DVDs use a different standard. Because Adobe did its home-
work, you don’t have to worry about the minutiae; all you have to do is choose the
video’s preset from Premiere’s Share tab.

Why So Many

Note: If you work with other videographers or production people, you may hear the term “codec” tossed
around. Any program that scrunches a big video file into a smaller, more nimble file is called a codec (a
contraction of the words “compressor” and “decompressor”). The video is compressed when it’s written
to a file and then it’s decompressed when it’s played. When you choose a preset, say for a DVD or iPod
Touch, Premiere automatically knows what codec to use.
Choose a Preset
The next few chapters provide the step-by-step details for exporting movies for
websites, video discs, and handheld devices like iPods and cellphones. Here’s a pre-
view of the steps you take when choose a preset to export your edited movie:
1. Click the Share tab to see the options shown previously in Figure 11-2.
2. Choose from one of the following “share” categories:
• Disc. Choose this option to have Premiere burn (write) a copy of your movie
onto a DVD or Blu-ray disc.
• Online. Choose this option to send your video to YouTube or Photoshop.
com. There’s also a preset here for Podbean, a podcasting website.
• Mobile Phones and Players. Choose this option to send your video to your
iPod, Zune, or other handheld gadget.
• Personal Computer. The presets here vary a little more than the others, but
they all create a video file that’s saved on your computer. There are file for-
mats for video for web pages, your computer, and email attachments. In this
category, you’ll also find presets to save still images and audio clips.
• Tape. If you have a tape-based video camera and like to archive your video
on tape, you can use this option to record your finished movie.
After you choose one of these categories, Premiere shows a new panel, like
the one in Figure 11-3, where you choose a specific destination for your
video and a preset.
3. Choose your video’s destination or device.
At the top of the panel, you see a scrolling list where you can choose the gadget,
website, or other destination for your video. For example, the Discs list gives
you a choice of DVD or Blu-ray disc. For mobile phones and players, you see a
list that includes Apple iPods, Creative Zens, Microsoft Zunes, and Sony PSPs.

Chapter 11: Choose a Video Format
321
Why So Many
Formats?
4. Choose a preset.
Here, you zero in on the characteristics of the video file that Premiere’s going to
create. Still, your choices aren’t difficult. For example, if you’re sending your
movie to an iPod, you simply choose between High Quality (if you have plenty
of room on your ’pod) or Medium Quality. In most case, you give the video file
your own name. In some cases, you choose a folder where you want Premiere to
save the file. Of course, that’s not necessary when Premiere burns the movie to a
disc or sends it off to YouTube.
5. Click the Save button, and Premiere, with the help of the presets, does its stuff.
That’s all there is to it. Whether you burn a DVD, copy a movie to your cellphone,
or send it off to YouTube, the steps are pretty much the same.

Upload Videos to
YouTube and the Web
If your videos are destined for the Web, you’re in luck. Premiere presets make it
easy to upload your videos to YouTube, Photoshop.com, Podbean, and your own
website. Adobe, the company that publishes Premiere, also publishes a program
called Flash. In the past few years, Flash files (whose file names end in .flv and .f4v)
have become the video champs of the Internet. You find Flash-based videos on
sites from YouTube to Hulu.
It wasn’t long ago that a battle royale raged between Microsoft, Apple, and Real-
Media for web video bragging rights. Back then, Flash seldom got mentioned in
the contest; in those days, the only thing web designers used Flash for was creating
little animations and annoying ads. But, like the Trojans with their famous horse,
the Flash player managed to sneak onto about 90 percent of today’s computers.
And guess what? Flash now plays full-blown movie files, too. And before the com-
petition could react, the Flash for Video format became a web standard because it
provided a way to compress movies down to a reasonable size.
This chapter shows you how to prepare and send your videos to YouTube, Photo-
shop.com, Podbean, and other websites. Along the way, you’ll get tips on creating
Flash videos that are small and fast—perfect for websites.
Prepare Your Movie for YouTube
YouTube is an Internet phenomenon. People just like you put their movies on the
video-sharing site, where anyone with an Internet connection can watch them. So
what kind of things will you find on YouTube? You probably already know, but
here are a couple random samples: Couples create YouTube wedding invitations.

Teenagers produce videos explaining why they love or hate a band. Musicians post
performances in the hope that it will boost their career. Sports fans post their rants
and raves.
In addition to the amateur content, there’s plenty of professional content, too.
You’ll find everything from original Star Trek episodes to ABC World News
broadcasts to technology posts from a New York Times columnist named David
Pogue.
According to comScore, an organization that tracks all things web for marketing
purposes, in January 2009, one out of every three web videos was viewed on You-
Tube. Or, in other terms, 78.5 million viewers watched 3.25 billion YouTube videos.
And all the while, your boss thought you were working on the quarterly report.
You’ve seen YouTube videos replayed on network television and news shows.
You’ve probably had friends send you links to funny clips. You may have watched
a YouTube tutorial to learn how to use a computer program or fix an appliance.
It’s obvious why YouTube is so popular; the site’s designers made it easy to upload
videos to the web. Oh yeah, they also made it free. You don’t have to have a You-
Tube account to watch videos on YouTube, but you do have to have an account to
upload videos. It’s an easy process—for the details, see the box on page 331.
YouTube offers guidelines for videos. It’s helpful to understand what they think
works best, but if you use Premiere’s presets, it’s not something you have to worry
about. While they say they can handle almost any video format, here’s what You-
Tube recommends for different specifications:
• Video Format: H.264, MPEG-2, or MPEG-4.
• Aspect Ratio: Use native aspect ratio without letterboxing, either 16:9 or 4:3.
• Resolution: For 16:9 aspect ratios, use 640×360; for 4:3 aspect ratios, use 480×360.
• Audio format: Either AAC or MP3.
• Frames per second: 30.
• Maximum length: 10 minutes, though they recommend videos that are 2 to 3
minutes long.
• Maximum file size: 1 gigabyte.
Naturally, these specifications are likely to change over time. You can always double-
check the current specs on YouTube’s website (www.youtube.com).
After your movie is all edited and ready to go, follow these steps to encode it for
the Web and upload it to YouTube.
1. In Premiere, click the Share tab and then click Online.
The Tasks panel displays a scrolling list where you can choose different online
services, including YouTube, Photohop.com, and Podbean.

Chapter 12: Upload Videos to YouTube and the Web
325
Prepare Your Movie

2. From the scrolling list, choose YouTube and then click Next.
Premiere uses the Flash preset for YouTube. It sets the file format to FLV/F4V.
Using the Medium setting, the frame size is set to a small but zippy 320 × 240
and the frame rate to 30 frames per second. Premiere displays the file size and
duration of your video.
3. Type in a title, description, and tags that describe your video (Figure 12-1),
and then click Next.
These words appear with your video on the YouTube website, so if you want the
world to beat a path to your movie, put some thought into them, especially the
tags. To see some good examples of tags, browse through a few YouTube videos
to see how other people tag their movies.
UP TO SPEED
Get a YouTube Account
You need to have a YouTube account to upload videos. The
account is free, and it’s easy to sign up, but be forewarned
that the Terms of Use, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy
take what seems like an hour and a half to read. (You do
read every word before you click the Accept button on web-
sites, don’t you?) As always, the details go on for several
lawyerly pages with the caveat that they may change from
time to time, and it’s your responsibility to know when that
happens. For the most part, Google (YouTube’s owner)
wants you to agree that the content you upload is yours and
doesn’t infringe on anyone else’s copyrights. So, unless
you’re Mick Jagger or Keith Richards, your video probably
shouldn’t have a Rolling Stones soundtrack. Some other
clauses make it sound like they’d prefer if you don’t try to
hack or attack the YouTube website for some reason.
If you already have a Google account for Gmail or for some
other Google service, you can use your existing username
and password to sign into YouTube. Go directly to YouTube
(youtube.com) or sign into your Google service and then
look for a link to the video-sharing site. In Gmail, there’s a
YouTube option at the top of each window, listed along
with Calendar, Documents, and other tools (you may have
to click “More” to see it). iGoogle provides a YouTube link
in a panel on the home page.
Once you get to YouTube’s home page, click Sign In at the
top right, then type in your Google username and password.
Otherwise, you can create a new YouTube account, which
amounts to this:
1. Go to youtube.com.
2. In the upper-right corner, click Sign Up.
3. Fill in the form with the name you want to be known
by on YouTube (called a username) and other
details, including a password.
4. YouTube gives you the option to let friends see your
“channel,” a standalone page that lists the videos
you upload or that you mark as “favorites” as you
browse YouTube. YouTube gives this page a unique
web address (youtube.com/[your username here])
so you can pass it on to friends. To accept this
option, check the box “Let others find my channel
on YouTube if they have my email address”.
5. Agree to the terms of service.
6. Click the “I accept” button.
After you accept, you see a new web page where you sign
in using the userrname and password you just created.

5. Click the Share button.
A new panel displays a progress bar as Premiere encodes and uploads your film.
On the right side of the bar, YouTube estimates how long the process will take.
When it’s complete, YouTube displays a confirmation panel like the one in

After Your YouTube Premiere
So, now that your video is the star of YouTube, here are a couple of things you can
do while you wait for that contract from Lorne Michaels. First, head over to your
YouTube page, which looks something like Figure 12-3. Here are some of the
things you can do to build traffic for your video:
• Show off your video using MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, orkut, Live Spaces, or
any other social site. Under the video, click the word Share. Click any of the
links, and YouTube helps you log into your account on the social site. Then you
can either embed your video on the social site or create a link for it.
• Email your friends links to your video. Underneath the social site tools, there’s
a box that says: “Copy and paste this link into an email or instant message”.
Click the text box below and then press Ctrl+C to copy the link that goes to
your video. Then you can type Ctrl+V to paste the link into an email or instant
message (or anywhere else, for that matter). Even easier, YouTube provides a
form where you can quickly type in email addresses and a message, then auto-
matically send the link to the recipients.
• Embed your video on your own website or blog. If you have your own website
or a blog where you can embed a little bit of HTML (webpage) code, you can
add a YouTube playback window. In reality, it links back to the YouTube web-
site, but it embeds the playback window on your site, complete with Play and
Pause controls. Best of all, you don’t have to be an HTML or JavaScript coder to
perform this feat. It’s a simple cut-and-paste operation. To the right of your
video, find the box that says “Embed”, as shown in Figure 12-4. Click the text
box and then use Ctrl+C to copy the code. Then, use Ctrl+V to paste this code
into the HTML code for your web page.
Figure 12-2:
YouTube’s “Share Complete!”
confirmation page provides
three links. Two of them take
you to your video on YouTube.
The third creates an email
message that has your video’s
web address embedded in the
text—great for letting friends
know your latest video
is online.

Send Your Movie to

• Change the music in your video with AudioSwap. If you’d like to add a legal
music soundtrack to your YouTube video, click the AudioSwap button. A new
page opens where you can audition royalty-free music that generous YouTubers
have uploaded. With a couple of clicks you can swap your soundtrack for a
selected tune. Just bear in mind that this permanently changes the YouTube
copy of your video.
Send Your Movie to Photoshop.com
Sending your movie to Photoshop.com isn’t that much different from sending it to
YouTube. You start on the Share tab and choose Online. Photoshop.com is the first
option in the scrolling list, and it’s already selected, so leave it that way. The drop-
down menu under “Presets” gives you only one preset, for Photoshop.com, and it,
too, is already selected. Click Next, sign in to Photoshop.com, and Photoshop dis-
plays a screen like the one in Figure 12-5. Click “Upload” to save your movie.
As mentioned earlier, you can also use Photoshop.com to back up your raw video,
but that can be an expensive proposition because you pay for the space you use. It
makes better sense to post copies of your finished videos to the site, because they
won’t take up quite so much room. Photoshop.com is another place where you can
share movies (and stills) with your friends and family.
Tip: You don’t have to fire up Premiere to load videos or photos to Photoshop.com. You can do it from
the website itself. When you’re on the site, click the “Upload Photos & Videos” button in the upper-right
corner. A window opens where you can browse through the folders on your computer. Select one or
more photos and/or videos to upload and then click Open. The window shown in Figure 12-6 appears to
help with the upload and organization.

Publish Your Movie

One of the best things about having your videos on Photoshop.com is the ease
with which you can manage the videos and photos you want to post to sites like
Facebook and Flickr. Go to the Photoshop.com library with your videos. In the left
column, click on the site you want to work with—Facebook, for example. A some-
what cryptic message appears that says: “Please click OK when you are done log-
ging in”. At that point, you’re supposed to log into your Facebook account. Since
you don’t want to leave Photoshop.com, do this in another browser window or
browser tab. Once you log into your Facebook account, come back and click the
OK button in the message box. Then, Photoshop.com displays your videos and
photos in the main part of the window, and, as shown in Figure 12-7, it displays
your Facebook albums in the left column. To add a video to Facebook, just drag it
to one of your Facebook albums.
Publish Your Movie to Podbean
Podbean is a site that hosts audio and video podcasts. There are four levels of
membership, ranging from free to about $20 a month. At the free level, you get 100
megabytes of storage and you and your visitors are entitled to 5 gigabytes of traffic
a month. That’s enough to give you a taste of the podcasting experience if you’re
interested but haven’t ever tried it. With a free account and Premiere, you’re ready
for broadcasting/podcasting business.
After you record and edit your podcast (see page 454), uploading it to Podbean is a
cinch; it’s just like uploading a video to YouTube or Photoshop.com. Go to Pre-
miere’s Share tab and then choose Online. Choose Podbean from the scrolling list
of online sites. From the presets menu you can choose to upload a video or just the
audio. You also have a choice of high or medium quality. Naturally, better quality
always means bigger files.

Click the Next button to see a panel where you provide a name, description, and

if you want to embed your podcast into a blog or other website; it’s similar to add-
ing a YouTube movie to your site.
Make Your Movies Web-Friendly
When you send your videos off to YouTube, Photoshop.com, or Podbean, you use
the presets provided by Premiere, so you don’t have to worry too much about all
the settings used to encode your movie. If you’re posting videos on other sites, you
need to pay a little more attention to the details. As mentioned before, smaller
video files download and play faster, so if you know your movie is destined for the
web, you want to keep the file size to a minimum. You’ll lose half your audience if
your video takes a long time to start playing or if it starts and stops instead of play-
ing smoothly.

Make Your Movies
Web-Friendly
Decisions you make early on have a significant effect on the size of your video file.
Sure, you can use a relatively small frame size and compress your movie. But you
can also make your video files smaller by shooting video that compresses well.
Camera motion and the visual qualities of your background dramatically affect
how well your video compresses.
Here are some things to consider when you shoot video for the Web:
• Use a tripod. If the background doesn’t constantly change, frame-to-frame com-
pression is more effective. When you shoot video with shaky, hand-held camera-
work, the background differs in every frame. But if you use a tripod, the
background is often as static as a still image. If you don’t have a tripod, perhaps
you can fake it by setting your camera on a table or some other surface. If you’re
outside, try steadying your hand with the help of a street sign, a wall, or a tree.
• Use pans, tilts, zooms, and dolly shots sparingly. Again, frame-to-frame com-
pression works better with an unchanging background. You probably don’t
want to avoid camera movement altogether, because it’s an important part of
moving pictures. So use it when there’s dramatic need, but avoid it otherwise.
Figure 12-8:
Podbean is a website that hosts
video and audio podcasts. Use the
panel shown here to provide a
name, description, and keywords for
your podcast, and Premiere

your account.

Chapter 12: Upload Videos to YouTube and the Web

• When possible, avoid backgrounds with complex patterns. Plain, solid colors
compress better than complicated random patterns. Multiply the intraframe
compression benefit over multiple frames, and it makes a difference. You may
not always have a choice, but when possible, put your subject in front of a
painted wall instead of a brick wall or other complex background.
When you use the presets for YouTube and some of the other online services, Pre-
miere handles the technical settings automatically. When you upload to a different
website or email a video, here are some file-shrinking options to consider.
Some of these tips involve editing decisions. Other are encoding choices you make
from Premiere’s Share tab, after you choose a video preset like Adobe Flash Video.
Click the Advanced button to open Premiere’s Export Settings window, as shown
in Figure 12-9:
• Minimize effects such as dissolves. A fancy transition, even your basic dissolve,
makes video files bigger. In general, videos with fewer effects and fewer cuts
compress better.
• Lower the frame rate. If your video is something static, like a talking head shot
for a video blog or news show, reduce the frame rate to 15 fps to reduce file size.
If there’s a lot of action in your video, you probably want to keep your frame
rate in the 24–30 fps range.
• Use mono sound instead of stereo or multichannel sound. Often, the benefits
of stereo or multichannel sound are minimal for web-based video. Also, in
many cases, camcorder mics don’t separate sound well, so they record nearly
identical sound on both tracks.
• Reduce the audio bit rate. If your movie’s audio consists primarily of voices and
sound effects, you may want to use an audio bit rate of 96 rather than 256 or 320.
• Reduce the audio sampling frequency. This is the audio equivalent of reducing
the frame rate. Music CDs use a sampling frequency rate of 44.1 kHz. If your
video doesn’t demand that kind of high fidelity, you can lower the rate to 22.05
kHz or even 11.025 (about the equivalent of an AM radio).
When it comes to video compression, every little bit helps. Using any one of the
techniques described here may not make a big difference, but if you use a few
together, you’ll see a difference in file size.
Put Video on Your Own Website
What if you want to send your video to a website other than one of those with the
predesigned presets? Premiere has a generic My Website option in the scroll list.
You can use this option to render your movie to one of Flash’s compact video for-
mats and then send it to the website of your choice. This doesn’t create a page to
display your video (that’s up to whoever manages your site); it simply copies your
edited movie to a web server.

2. Click “My Website”.
The Share panel changes to show the My Website options (Figure 12-10),
including a drop-down menu with different presets and text boxes where you
provide information about your site’s web server.

3. Choose one of the Flash video presets.
You have four options. First, decide whether you want to use the Flash Video 7
or the Flash Video 8 format. If you think the people visiting your site and view-
ing your video are likely to have older computers, it’s safer to use the Flash
Video 7 format. It’s older and compatible with a greater number of computers.
Otherwise, choose Flash 8, which uses the latest, greatest codec so it makes better-
looking video in smaller files.
The next choice has to do with the bit rate, or the Internet connection speed
required to smoothly play the video. Larger numbers require more speed. The
Flash 7 format offers two bit rates: 256K and 400K. Flash 8 offers two higher
speeds: 400K and 800K. If your website visitors have a high-speed Internet con-
nection (cable for example), they can view video at any of these speeds.
4. Type a server address and a filename.
You may not need to fill in the rest of the boxes, but you have to supply these
two details. If you don’t know the server address, get it from your webmaster
(in some cases, it may be the same as your website address). You may also need
to supply a port number. In the “FileName” section, give your video the name
you want it to have once Premiere copies it to your server. The person design-
ing your web page will also need to know this name.
Figure 12-10:
Premiere’s My Website panel
seems to want a lot of
information, but depending on
the site, you may not need to fill
in all the boxes. If you don’t
know the answers to the
questions in this panel, you may
have to contact the webmaster
for your server.

5. If necessary, specify a destination directory, a username, and a password.
Here, the directory refers to the directory or folder on the web server where you
want to store the file. Often, a server requires a username and password when
you transfer files to it (using a technology called FTP, file transfer protocol; Pre-
miere can handle an FTP transfer for you if you supply this information).
Again, your webmaster is a good resource for this info.
6. Click Next.
Premiere encodes your video to the Flash specification you provided and then
sends it to your Web server (Figure 12-11). You see a progress bars for both
procedures and an estimate of the time remaining.
At the end of the process, you see a confirmation message.
Figure 12-11:
Premiere has built-in tools so you can encode your
movie to one of the compact Flash video formats and
then send it to a website via a technology called FTP
( file transfer protocol). If you’re not familiar with
FTP, you may need to get some details from the site’s
webmaster. You need an address, a file name and
a directory.

Create DVDs and
Blu-ray Discs
Who ever thought that, one day, shiny little discs would change the way everyone
watches movies? Shortly after the CD (compact disc) sparked a revolution in the
audio world, DVDs (digital versatile discs) did the same in the video world. And
just as audio made the transition from pop- and hiss-filled tape and vinyl record-
ings to the crisp, precise renderings of digital files when it jumped to CDs, video
did the same when it moved from VHS tapes to DVDs. Great audio-visual quality.
Durable enough to mail. Easy to store. What’s not to love? And now, Blu-ray discs
have emerged as the next standard in digital video, with enough capacity to hold
feature-length movies in all their high-definition beauty.
This chapter shows you how to create pro-quality video discs, complete with
menus that let your viewers jump to a specific scene on the disc (or, for multi-
movie discs, to a specific movie on the disc). You’ll also learn how to use use and
edit the menu templates that come with Premiere. The first part of this chapter
explains how to make menus. The last part gives you step-by-step details for burn-
ing your movies to DVD or Blu-ray discs.
Menu, Please!
If you don’t create a menu for your movie before you burn it to disc, your video
starts playing as soon as someone pops it into a player. Premiere calls these “Auto-
Play” discs, and they’re fine for short flicks. But if you fill a DVD or Blu-ray disc
with video, your audience will appreciate some way to get around the disc, naviga-
tion tools like the one shown in Figure 13-1. That way, you can divide your movie

338
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Menu, Please!
into scenes (sometimes called chapters), and your audience can jump right to the
scene they want to watch. Or, if you have several movies on a disc, they can select
the movie they want to see.
You add menus to your disc using Premiere’s predesigned templates. They auto-
matically create two types of menus:
• The Main menu displays the title of your movie and has a Play Movie button. If
your movie has separate scenes, there’s also a link to a Scene menu (see below).
When someone pops your disc into a player, the main menu is the first thing
they see.
• The Scene menu provides links to individual scenes in your movie. (Hollywood
DVDs sometimes call these “chapters.”) The Scene menus also have a link back
to the main menu. If you’re movie isn’t long or complicated, you don’t have to
create scene menus. In that case, your movie only has a main menu with a sin-
gle link, which you click to play back your movie.
Note: It’s easy to add Premiere’s disc-menu templates to your project, but you can’t change the way they
behave. Premiere has preprogrammed them to create a main menu and a scene menu that work a cer-
tain way, so if you need a more complex menu structure, like one with submenus from the scenes menu
or other bells and whistles, you’ll have to use other video tools, like Adobe Encore, to create them. But for
the majority of your projects, Premiere probably fits the bill.
Set Menu Markers
So how does Premiere know where a scene, or, in the case of multiple-movie discs,
a movie begins and ends? You gently point the way by placing markers in the time-
line. Markers are a little like bookmarks: When Premiere gets down to the busi-
ness of assembling your menus, it uses these “bookmarks” to build links from the
Figure 13-1:
Premiere creates two
menus for your discs:
main menus and scene
menus, the latter of
which is shown here.
After you use one of
Premiere’s predesigned
templates, you can
customize the text
and images.

Chapter 13: Create DVDs and Blu-ray Discs

Menu, Please!
disc’s menus to a specific spot on your DVD or Blu-ray disc. As you explored time-
line markers (page 170) and beat markers (page 308) in previous chapters, you
may have noticed the Menu Marker option (Figure 13-2). (Each of these three
markers has a different look, so you won’t confuse one with the other as you work
in the timeline.)
Think about the different ways you might want to present your movie and the way
a DVD player needs to behave:
• Discs with multiple scenes. When you create menus for a movie that has multi-
ple scenes, you want the movie to continue playing after each scene. No need to
make your audience choose each scene from a menu.
• Discs with multiple movies. When you create menus for a disc with multiple
movies, you want to play all the scenes for a movie and then, at the end, send the
audience back to the main menu, where they can choose another movie. Wonder-
ing how to put multiple movies on a single disc? See the box on page 340.
You can create a disc with these kinds of navigational smarts with the help of just
three types of color-coded menu markers that you place in your timeline:
• Main Menu Marker (blue). Use the main menu marker to signal the beginning
of a movie. If you have more than one movie on a disc, use a main menu
marker to flag the beginning of each one. When your audience clicks a link on
the main menu, your movie starts to play at the point where you placed the
main menu marker. The selected movie plays until it reaches a stop marker (see
below), and then it sends the audience back to the main menu.
• Scene Marker (green). If you want to divide your movie into scenes, place a scene
marker at the beginning of each one. Premiere displays links to the scenes in the
Scenes submenu using the scene markers. When a movie is playing and it comes
to a scene marker, it just keeps on playing. If your movie has more than three or
four scenes, Premiere creates more than one scene menu to list them all.
• Stop Marker (red). Use a stop marker at the end of a movie to send your audi-
ence back to the main menu.
Set Menu Markers Automatically
Premiere offers a feature that automatically sets your menu markers, but most of
the time, you’ll be happier with the results if you set menu markers by hand. That
way, you’re sure they’re in logical positions for the subject matter. However, there
may be times when you’re in a big rush or when it works to place scene markers at
regular intervals, say every 3 minutes. This can be especially helpful if you’re
archiving some of your raw footage—automatically putting markers at regular
intervals makes it easy to scan the footage as you search for specific material.

340
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Menu, Please!
For those occasions when you want to automatically divvy up your movie:
1. Click a clip in the timeline.
You don’t have to select every clip—one does the trick.
2. Choose Disc ➝ Generate Menu Markers.
A
window
appears
labeled
“Automatically

(Figure 13-3).
3. Choose one of the three options for setting markers:
• At Each Scene tells Premiere to set markers at the beginning of each clip in
the timeline. This is a good option if you have a lot of raw video in a
project—for example, if you have an archive disc for raw clips.
• Every X Minutes sets markers at regular intervals, a good option for long
videos where you or your audience may want to jump around to sample dif-
ferent sections.
Figure 13-2:
Use the Markers menu on the right side of the Timeline to
add Main Menu, Scene, and Stop markers to your movie.
Premiere uses these markers to create menus for DVDs
and Blu-ray discs.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Create a Multiple Movie Disc
How do I put multiple movies on a single DVD or Blu-ray
Disc?
First, you have to put all the movies on the same timeline.
Then you mark the beginning and end of each movie. The
last step is to use Premiere’s Share tools to copy all the
movies to a disc at one time. This leads to the next fre-
quently asked question:
How to I put multiple movies on a single timeline?
If you plan ahead, you could build your movies that way—
putting movies one after the other in a single project, on a
single timeline. That’s not always practical or possible.
Another option is to export each edited movie as a single
video file and then import those movies into a new Pre-
miere project. For details on how to export movies to com-
puter files, see page 380.

Menu, Please!
• Total Markers places markers at even intervals throughout your movie. You
provide the number of markers you want and Premiere does the math.
4. (Optional) Check Clear Existing Menu Markers.
Premiere doesn’t disturb any markers in the timeline when it creates new ones.
It simply adds the newly generated markers. Check this option to remove exist-
ing markers before you generate the new ones. It clears all Main Menu, Scene,
and Stop markers.
5. Click OK.
After you click OK, the Marker window closes and the scene markers appear in
the timeline.
Create Markers Manually
Most of the time, you’ll probably create menu markers manually. After all, you
know exactly where one scene or movie ends and another begins.
To set markers manually, drag the playhead (or click the Previous and Next Edit
Point button in the monitor) to a spot in the timeline where you want a marker.
Then choose the type of marker you need. For main menu and scene markers, you
can add text and a thumbnail image to the marker, which Premiere uses in the
menus it creates. Here are the steps:
1. In the timeline, position the playhead where you want a marker.
Alternatively, you can type a specific time in the number box in the monitor.
2. Click the Markers menu and then choose Menu Marker ➝ Set Menu Marker.
A window appears labeled “Menu Marker @” followed by the playhead’s time-
line position, as shown in Figure 13-4.
Figure 13-3:
Premiere can place a marker at the beginning of each clip,
or it can put markers at regular intervals throughout your
movie. If you want them at regular intervals, you can set
the timing for the interval or type in the total number of
markers you want Premiere to add and let it figure out
the timing.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

3. Click the Marker Type drop-down menu and choose one of the options.
You have three choices: Main Menu, Scene, and Stop.
If you’re not dividing your disc into scenes, choose Stop marker. The only other
thing you have to do is click OK, and Premiere adds a red Stop marker to the
timeline. You can skip the rest of the steps below.
4. To place a main menu or scene marker, type in a name for it.
The name will appear on the disc menu Premiere creates, so it’s best to keep
them short—otherwise they won’t fit on the menu screen. Premiere doesn’t
give marker names a whole lot of real estate in the menus.
5. (Optional) Click the Motion Menu button.
This option adds a moving picture to the Scene menu instead of a still thumbnail.
6. (Optional) Specify a timecode for the Thumbnail Offset.
The thumbnail offset designates which frame starts the moving image Premiere
displays in the Scene menu. As you change the time in the thumbnail offset, the
thumbnail picture changes. You can change the offset by typing in a new num-
ber or you can drag to scrub in a new time value.
7. Click OK.
Your manually created marker appears in the timeline, with a color that
matches its purpose in life. Main menu markers are blue, scene markers green,
and stop markers red.
Tip: Lots of times, you want to put markers at the very beginning of a clip. You can use the shortcut keys
PageUp and PageDown to jump to the cuts between clips.
Add Stop Markers
When you burn single or multiple movies on a single disc, you want the audience
to return to the main menu at the end of the movie. That little chore is the domain
of the Stop marker. Whenever a DVD player encounters a stop marker, it stops
playback and jumps to the disc’s main menu. Follow these steps to insert a stop
marker:
1. Position the playhead where you want the stop marker.
2. Click the Marker menu and then choose Menu Marker ➝ Set Menu Marker.
3. Click the Marker Type drop-down menu and choose Stop Marker.
4. Click OK.

Delete or Move Markers in the Timeline
If you decide you no longer need a menu marker, right-click it and then choose
Clear Menu Marker from the shortcut menu (Figure 13-5). If the timing for your
marker isn’t quite right, you don’t have to delete it and start over—you can simply
drag it to a new location. When you delete or move menu markers, Premiere auto-
matically renumbers them so they’ll be properly ordered on the scene menus.

Use a Stock Menu
After you get your markers squared away, it’s time to test out some menus. Pre-
miere comes with a bunch of menu templates. The good news is that they’re easy
to use. Once you’ve placed markers in the timeline, the templates automatically
use the markers to create scene menus (or movie menus if you create a multi-
movie disc). The not-so-good news is that many of the menus are pretty hokey. At
least in the initial package, most of them seem more appropriate for kid-vids
rather than grownups. To be fair, Adobe promises to keep delivering additional
menus and other content via Photoshop.com. Also, if you can’t find a template
that suits your project, you can apply a menu template and then customize it using
your own graphics and music, as explained on page 345.
Applying a stock menu is a drag-and-drop operation:
1. In the Tasks panel, click the Disc Menus tab.
The Disc Menus panel shows thumbnails of the available menu templates. Ini-
tially, you see all the templates in one long scrollable list. You can narrow that
down using the two drop-down menus.
2. Use the top-left menu to pick a general topic, such as Sports.
The menu offers other topics, including Entertainment, Happy Birthday, Kids
Corner, and New Baby. Once you choose a topic, the secondary menu displays
templates related to that topic.
3. Use the secondary menu to choose a specific template, such as Extreme.
Each template comes with two screens, one for the main menu and the other
for the Scenes menu.
4. Click on the menu template and then, at the bottom of the Disc Menus panel,
click Apply.
When you first apply a menu, the monitor displays the main menu, as shown in
Figure 13-6. At the bottom of the monitor, you can choose between the individ-
ual main and scene menus that Premiere generates for your project. Each scene
menu accommodates three or four scenes. Should your movie have more scenes
than that, Premiere automatically creates additional scene menus. And if you
added menu markers to your film, Premiere displays the thumbnails in the
scene menu.
5. In the lower-right corner of the monitor, click the Preview button.
A menu preview window opens, showing the same type of controls you find on
most DVD or Blu-ray players. The background music plays and you can click
any of the buttons to test-drive your disc menu system. This is a good time to
check things out and make at least mental notes if you want to change the tem-
plate. For example, there’s boilerplate text in the menu titles (“Movie Title
Here”). Perhaps the background music isn’t right for your project, or you want
to find better images for the scene thumbnails.

6. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the Menu Preview window.
The window closes.
7. Press Ctrl+S.
Even if you’re going to make changes to the menus, this is a good place to save
your work.
The menu preview window gives you a reasonable idea of how your DVD will look
once you burn it. Don’t forget that the video images may not be up to par because
Premiere taps the same preview versions of clips (rather than the original footage)
that it uses as you edit your movie. But don’t worry—when you burn your disc,
Premiere uses your original footage to create the high-quality clips that go into
your menus (and your movie, of course).
Edit a Stock Menu
You almost always want to make some changes to Premiere’s menu templates. If
nothing else, you at least want to change the main text to reflect the title of your
movie. Fortunately, it’s easy to make some quick changes.
1. In the main menu, double-click the text box with the words “Main Movie Title.”
The Change Text box, shown in Figure 13-6, opens, displaying the text cur-
rently in the box.
Figure 13-6:
Double-click any text box
in a menu to open it for
editing. Keep in mind that
the menus have limited
space for text, so you
can’t use overly long
movie or scene titles. The
available space varies by
template.

2. Select the text and replace it with your title—something like Lola’s Big Splash.
Then click OK.
When you click OK, your new text replaces the original title. It’s always best to
double-check to make sure the text fits in the menu.
3. (Optional) Add a media file to a “drop zone.”
Some menus include drop zones where you can drag and drop video or still
photos that will appear on the menu page. Examples include General ➝Fun,
Entertainment ➝ Music Video and Travel ➝ Road Trip.
To add a still or video to a drop zone, click the Organize tab and then click the
Project button. Drag a clip from the Project tab to the drop zone.
4. (Optional) Change the position and formatting of the text box.
As you change the words in a menu, you may want to move or modify the text
font and style:
• Move the text box. Drag the text box to a new location to reposition it.
• Change the text size. With the text box selected, in the Disc Menus panel
(Figure 13-7), change the value in Change Text Size box. When you change
the point size for text, it keeps its proportions. You can distort the text using
the next technique.
• Distort text dimensions. Drag one of the text-box handles to change the
width or height of the text.
• Change the typeface. Choose a new typeface from the Change Text Font
drop-down menu. Delicate fonts with lots of thin lines don’t work well for
video, so it’s best to stick with bolder, simpler typefaces.
Figure 13-7:
You can change the font, color, and
style of the text in your menus. Just
select the box and use the tools in the
Disc Menus panel to make the
changes.

• Change Font Style. Use the drop-down menu next to the font names to
choose a style such as Italic, Bold, or Black. In most cases, the thickest, bold-
est styles work best.
• Change the text color. Click the color chip and choose a new color from the
menu. Make sure your text stands out from the background colors.
• Change text style to Bold, Italic, or Underlined. In most cases, it’s best to use
the Change Font Style drop-down menu to make style changes because they
tap the fonts installed on your computer and provide the best font quality. If
you don’t see the option you want there, use one of these buttons.
Adobe uses different terms for the different types of text in its menus. The
categories include Text Items, Play Buttons, Scene Buttons, and Marker But-
tons. If you want to change all the text boxes of a certain type, make the
changes to one of the text boxes and then click the “Apply to all” button at
the bottom. For example, you can apply changes to the Text Item boxes on
the Main Menu and the Scene Menus.
5. At the bottom of the monitor, click Scenes Menu 1.
Premiere displays the Scenes menu in the monitor, as shown in Figure 13-8. It
includes four scenes that match the scene markers you added to the timeline.
Each displays a thumbnail image and a title. As explained on page 342, when
you create scene markers, you name them. Premiere uses those names to label
the scenes in the menu.
Figure 13-8:
Premiere puts four
scenes on each Extreme
Sports scene menu. If you
added more than four
scene markers to your
movie, Premiere creates
additional scene menus.
For the sake of
symmetry, you may
want to use an even
number of scenes in your
movie. That way, you
won’t end up with an
additional scene menu
with just a single scene
on it.

348
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Use a Stock Menu
6. Edit the title for the Scenes page.
Premiere’s title for the scenes menu is something imaginative like “Scene Menu
Title.” You may want to change it to something that’s more in tune with your
movie, such as “Lola’s Big Splash – Scenes.” If your title is too big to fit on the
screen, use one of the techniques described earlier to resize the text.
7. Click the first scene thumbnail in the upper-left corner of the menu.
The Disc Menu panel displays its properties, as you can see in Figure 13-9. Use
the settings here to make changes.
8. Double-click the thumbnail in the Disc Menu Premiere uses for the first scene.
The “Menu Mark @” window opens. This is the same old friend you used to
create the menu marker in the first place. You can use this box to change the
marker type, the name, and the thumbnail (Figure 13-10). That last option,
changing the thumbnail, is the one you’ll probably use most often. Premiere
automatically uses the first frame after a marker as the thumbnail image. You
can change it two ways:
• Create a Motion Menu Button.
• Change the thumbnail image or start point.
Figure 13-9:
Select any element in the menu and the Disc Menus panel
displays its properties. Shown here are the properties for
a scene marker. They include the button type, the poster
frame, and the text format.

Chapter 13: Create DVDs and Blu-ray Discs
349
Use a Stock Menu
9. (Optional) Check the Motion Menu Button box.
Check this box, and instead of using a still image for the thumbnail, Premiere
plays a few seconds of the scene’s video in the thumbnail. Sometimes this works
great, but sometimes it creates a menu that’s a little too busy. Use your own
judgment.
10.(Optional) Change the time value in Thumbnail Offset.
The time value to the right of the thumbnail image selects the frame for a still
thumbnail or the starting point of a thumbnail video. Often, that first frame in
a clip has some sort of “fade in” or “dissolve” effect, so it makes sense to choose
a frame farther down the timeline. In other cases, you may want a better visual
to define a scene.
Tip: You can change the Thumbnail Offset using the “Menu Marker @” window or the Poster Frame In
Point in the Disc Menus panel. Both options have advantages and disadvantages. The Disc Menus panel
has a handy Play button to help you find the perfect frame, while the “Menu Marker @” window gives
you a bigger, better view of the thumbnail image.
11. Click OK.
The scene menu button now reflects your changes.
12. Repeat these steps to edit the other scene buttons and then click Done.
The Done button is hidden away in the lower-right corner of the Disc Menus
panel.
Figure 13-10:
Double-click one of the scene buttons
in the menu or one of the markers in
the timeline and you see this “Menu
Mark @” window, where you can
make changes. Premiere uses the
name and thumbnail images here to
create scene menus.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Create a Custom
Menu
You can jump to any of the menus in your project by clicking the buttons at the
bottom of the menu monitor. Often it takes some tweaking and previewing to get
your menu just right. If you want to leave the menu monitor and go back to your
movie in Premiere’s regular monitor, go to Window ➝Monitor. To jump back to
the menu monitor, click the Disc Menus tab.
Swap Menu Templates
Premiere’s menu templates are pretty consistent in the way they look and work. They
all use the menu markers in the timeline to build menus, for example. Title text may
appear in different locations, and some scene menus have three scenes instead of four,
but these are pretty minor differences. In most cases, you can swap one menu for
another without a whole lot of work. Just go to the Disc Menus tab and use the two
drop-down menus to choose a new template. Click on the template to select it and
then click the Apply button. After you make changes, preview the results to make sure
everything looks good. Look carefully for text that doesn’t quite fit in the text boxes.
Remove a Menu from a Project
There may be times when you want to strip a menu from your project. In Premiere-
speak a menu-less DVD project is known as an Auto-Play project. That’s because
discs without menus begin to play as soon as you put them in a player.
To remove a menu from your project, click the Disc Menus tab and then, in the
lower-right corner of the Menu monitor, click the Auto-Play button. Without any
fanfare or so much as an “Are you sure?”, Premiere removes the menu from your
project.
Tip: It’s not hard to accidentally click the Auto-Play button when you mean to click the Preview button. As
shown in Figure 13-11, they’re right next to each other. Poof! All the hard work you just put in to create
your menu disappears into the ether. Don’t panic. Just press Ctrl+Z or click Edit ➝Undo and you’re menu
is back.
Create a Custom Menu
Premiere’s templates don’t work for every project. They’re all pretty much in your
face, and many might tickle a 12-year-old’s fancy more than an adult’s. Fortu-
nately, you can change the background images and the accompanying music to
create your own menus or templates. Often, you don’t have to go any further than
your own timeline to find some great images for your project. Remember, you can
create a still from any video frame in your project. That’s a large library of still
images. You can even shoot some images with your menu in mind.

Chapter 13: Create DVDs and Blu-ray Discs
351
Create a Custom
Menu
Create a Menu Background Image
For your menu background, you want an image that lets the text and scene thumb-
nails stand out. That means simple images work better. If the image is mostly light-
hued, you can use dark-colored text or vice-versa. Many images are too busy or
too colorful for menu backgrounds, but you can always use Premiere’s effects to
modify an image to make it suitable as a menu background.
Note: You can’t change the background image for templates that have “drop zones,” areas in a template
menu to which you can drag-and-drop still or video images. Other menu templates use multiple graphics
files that are difficult to customize. Examples of easily customizable templates include Sports ➝Extreme
and Happy Birthday ➝ Balloons.
Creating a new background image for a menu involves these steps:
• Find a frame in your video that you want to use as a background image.
• Modify the image using Premiere’s effects or an image editor such as Photo-
shop Elements.
• Save the image as a file.
• Open your edited video project with a menu template already applied.
• Swap your saved image for the background image in the menu template.
If you’re up for the challenge, follow these steps to create a new background image:
1. Go to File ➝ New ➝ Project.
Creating a background still often involves a bit of experimentation with effects.
If you do it as a new project, you’re less likely to mess up your perfectly edited
video.

2. Drag the clip that has the image you want to use to the timeline.
The video appears in the monitor.
3. Preview the clip until you find the right frame.
Use whatever means necessary to zero in on that perfect frame. The Shuttle but-
ton, shown in Figure 13-12, is a good tool for this job because it lets you vary
the playback speed as you preview, and you can easily move forward and back-
ward within a clip.
4. In the lower-right corner of the monitor, click the Freeze Frame button (the
camera icon).
The Freeze Frame window opens, and you can export a still or insert the still
image back into the timeline.
5. Click “Insert in Movie”.
Most of the time, a still image can use the help of some effects, so pop the still
back into the timeline and experiment with one of Premiere’s effects.
6. Click the Edit tab and then click the Effects button.
The Edit panel shows dozens of different effects.
7. Experiment with different effects and combinations of effects.
The goal here is to create a background that won’t fight with the menu text or
scene thumbnails. That means you want to reduce the detail, contrast, and color
differences between the background image and the menu elements. If you need
a refresher on how to apply and edit Premiere effects, see page 197.

Here are some effects you may want to try, but don’t be afraid to experiment
with the others:
• Image Control. Every clip has the fixed effect “Image Control” applied to it.
Used sparingly, you can tweak these settings to make an image look more
realistic. In some cases, you may want to make more extreme changes to cre-
ate non-photorealistic images. First, try moving the Saturation slider to the
left to remove color from the image. By taking color out of the background
image, the colorful menu text and thumbnail images stand out. If you com-
pletely destaturate the image, it becomes black and white. If you only go part
way, the image becomes washed out. This isn’t usually a good look for a
photo, but it’s not bad for a menu background. After you remove the color,
try increasing the brightness and reducing the contrast. You can also adjust
the hue, keeping in mind the colors you want to use for the menu text.
• NewBlue Art Effects. Several of the NewBlue art effects work well for menus.
The Air Brush effect can make your photorealistic frame look like hand-
drawn art—a great effect for menus. The Line Drawing effect removes color
from an image, leaving lines at the edges, as shown in Figure 13-13. Using
Edit Effects, you can change the line and background colors. Use the Density
slider to add or remove line detail. Pastel Sketch softens colors while adding
edge lines.
• Emboss. Initially, the Emboss effect (Stylize ➝Emboss) creates a mostly gray
3D image. Gray makes a good background because color type and thumb-
nails pop out in contrast. If you want, you can change the gray using the
Blend With Original slider.
8. With the modified frame selected, click Freeze Frame again.
Yes, you’re freeze-framing a freeze frame—it’s the best way to export a still
image.
9. Click Export.
The Export Frame window opens, where you name your image and choose a
place to save it.
10.Type a name such as background_embossed.bmp and then click Save.
Premiere saves freeze frames in Windows bitmap (.bmp) format. Make sure
you save your freeze frame on your desktop or some other handy folder.
11. Click the X button to close the Freeze Frame window and then choose File
➝ Close to close your background image Premiere project.
That completes the first few steps of finding and customizing a background
image.
You can give the main menu and the scenes menu unique backgrounds, so you
may want to create a second freeze frame.

Swap Menu Background Images
You can use any image file on your computer as a background image. That
includes photos, hand-drawn art, or freeze frames from your movie. Once you
store an image in a computer file, it’s pretty easy to swap one menu background
for another:
1. Go to File ➝ Open Project and then open your edited movie.
If you haven’t already added menu markers and applied a menu to your project,
you need to do that before you can move on with this exercise. See page 338.
2. Click Disk Menus.
Select a menu template and drag it to the monitor. Premiere displays the Main
Menu.
3. Click within the Main Menu to select the Menu Background.
Once you select the Menu Background, the Menu Background properties
appear in the Disc Menus panel.
4. Under Menu Background, click the Browse button.
A file browser window opens. Locate the background image you created for
your menu.

5. Select your background image and then click Open.
Your background image appears in the monitor, as shown in Figure 13-14.
Often, you won’t know if an image works as a background until you see it in
place.
If you want to replace the background image for the Scenes menu, too, click Scene
Menu 1 at the bottom of the monitor and repeat Steps 4 and 5.
Sometimes, you need to make a few changes for the background to work just right.
For example, you may want to reposition the scene thumbnails to let part of a
background image show through, as shown in Figure 13-15. In other cases, you
may want to resize the text or scene thumbnails. Resist the temptation to make
things so small that your audience can’t see them on a TV screen. If necessary, go
back and make more changes to the background image.
Premiere automatically forces background images to fit the video frame. You can’t
drag the image handles beyond the edges of the frame, so you can’t zoom in on
part of your image. The only way to do that is open the image in an editor like
Photoshop Elements to resize and crop it.
Note: For details on how to edit images in Photoshop Elements, check out Photoshop Elements 8: The
Missing Manual by Barbara Brundage.

Swap Menu Music
The other major element of Premiere’s menu templates is their music. When you
first add a menu to your project, Premiere uses a music loop that’s related to the
menu (and theme, if you applied one of Premiere’s themes to your movie). The
music Premiere applies to menus is professionally produced, and most of it is on
the lively side of rock and roll. Whether this works for your movie is up to you. As
the producer/director, you can take over for the music department and change the
background score.
With your project open, follow these steps:
1. Click the Disc Menus tab.
The main menu appears in the monitor.
2. Click on the Main Menu background in the Monitor.
The Main Menu properties screen appears in the Disc Menus panel, and it
includes an audio section.
3. Under Audio, click the Browse button, as shown in Figure 13-16.
A file browser window opens, where you can navigate through the folders on
your computer.
4. Find an audio file you want to use for background music and then click Open.
Premiere swaps the soundtrack for the menus, but you may not be able to tell
from the Disc Menus panel.

5. Under the monitor, click the Preview button.
As you audition the new music, you may want to consider a different starting
point for it.
6. (Optional) Change the In Point for the audio.
There are three ways to change the background music’s starting point.
• Click the time value and type in a new time.
• Drag the time value to scrub in a new time.
• Click the Play button and then click Pause to set a new time.
7. (Optional) Check “Apply Default Transition before loop”.
The menu audio loops—meaning that, when it gets to the end of the sound clip,
it starts playing again at the beginning. You may want the music to fade out and
then fade in at these points. Usually a fade-in is the default audio transition, so
checking this box makes your menu audio fade out and then fade back in.
8. (Optional) Change the Duration.
Most menus are set up to play music for about 30 seconds before it loops. You
can change the timing with this setting.
Figure 13-16:
Click the background of the Main (or Scene) Menu to see the audio settings.
Use the Browse button to swap the background sound file. The other
settings help you control the timing for the looped audio track.

Famous DVD Moment: You may not always want to use music as background audio for your movie.
For example, the DVD for Rob Reiner’s Rock and Roll mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap has some of the
funniest dialog ever running behind menus. The somewhat deranged members of the band are critiquing
how the DVD menu is designed.
Preview Your Movie and Menus
Before you commit your movie to a DVD or Blu-ray disc, it pays to give it a thor-
ough review. That includes watching all the footage and giving the menu system a
good workout. As explained earlier, the best way to test the menus is to click the
Disc Menus tab and then click the Preview button below the monitor. The Pre-
view Disc window opens, sporting the same controls you find on disc players. Use
these controls to check all the links on the menus. Make sure the Scene links take
you to the point in the video you expect. Double-check the stop markers by fast-
forwarding to the end of your movie.
When it comes to previewing your video, you can do that in the Preview Disc win-
dow or in Premiere’s main monitor.
Burn a DVD or Blu-ray Disc
While editing is a satisfying intellectual pastime, showing off your movie to friends
and family is where you find glory. It’s hard to find someone who can’t watch a
DVD on their computer or TV, making DVDs an excellent video distribution
medium. If you’ve gone all-out with high-definition video, you likely shot your
video with one of the new HD video camcorders, bought a Blu-ray disc burner for
your computer, and hooked up a Blu-ray disc player to your home theater system.
(If you’re not up to speed on Blu-ray technology, see the box on page 359.)
As you learned earlier, you can create discs that display menus when they start up
or you can create discs without menus, which start playing back as soon as you put
them in a player.
If you want to create a menu and haven’t done so already, go directly to the begin-
ning of this chapter. Do not pass Go, and do not collect $200. Actually, creating a
good menu system is more work than burning a disc.

Chapter 13: Create DVDs and Blu-ray Discs

Burn a DVD or Blu-
ray Disc
Once you’re sure your project is ready for distribution, follow these steps to burn a
disc:
1. Pop a blank disc into your computer’s writable disc drive.
If you have questions about the different types of blank discs, see the box on
page 362.
2. Click the Share tab.
Premiere displays the different options for sharing your video.
3. Click the Disc button.
The Share tab shows settings to create DVD or Blu-ray discs.
4. Choose DVD or Blu-ray.
You lucky souls with Blu-ray disc burners and Blu-ray players can gloat a little as
you click the Blu-ray option. On the other hand, if you’re scratching your head and
asking “What the heck’s Blu-ray, and to I really care?”, see the box on page 359.
5. (Optional for DVDs) Set the “Burn to” menu to “Folder (4.6 GB)” or “Folder
(8.5GB)” depending on the type of blank disc you’ll be using, and choose a file
location.
Today’s fast computers are pretty good at rendering movies and burning them
directly to a DVD, but that hasn’t always been the case. With slower, older com-
puters you may want to copy the movie file for a DVD to a folder on your
UP TO SPEED
DVD or Blu-ray?
When it comes to technology, time always marches on. The
next stop on the disc-recording tech train is Blu-ray. If you
don’t have any Blu-ray equipment at the moment, odds are
you will in the future. Blu-ray discs look just like CDs or
DVDs, but they store five to 10 times the information. They
were developed to deliver full high-definition movies and
video to your HDTV—a standard DVD just doesn’t have
enough capacity. How do they manage to cram more data
on those same-sized shiny discs? Instead of using a red
laser, as CDs and DVDs do, Blu-ray discs use a violet laser,
which uses a shorter wavelength of light—hence the name
“Blu-ray”. Somehow, this makes it easier to cram more 1s
and 0s onto a shiny disc.
There was a relative short high-def format war, when Blu-
ray and HD DVD technologies fought it out. The Blu-ray
forces had a long list ofheavyweights in their corner, including
Apple, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Samsung, Sony,
20th Century Fox, Walt Disney Motion Pictures, and Warner
Brothers. The combination of hardware and content pro-
viders won the day for Blu-ray. The HD DVD forces flew the
white flag and surrendered in early 2008.
A single-layer Blu-ray disc holds 25 gigabytes of informa-
tion, compared to a single-layer DVD’s capacity of 4.7
gigabytes. Double-layer Blu-ray discs hold about 50
gigabytes of information, while double-layer DVDs hold
about 8 gigabytes.
If you have trouble remembering how Blu-ray is spelled
and capitalized, just think of it as a single word, “Blueray,”
where the “e” is replaced with a hyphen; the “r” is always
lowercase.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Burn a DVD or Blu-
ray Disc
computer and then use DVD burning software, like Nero BackItUp & Burn or
Roxio Creator, to burn a disc.
What’s the advantage? If Premiere fails to encode and burn a disc in one shot,
you have to start all over from the beginning. However, if Premiere manages to
copy your movie to a folder on your computer, you can exit Premiere and not
have to worry about whether it can handle both assembling and burning your
movie in the same step. Running by itself, a DVD burning program uses fewer
computer resources than Premiere does as it creates a disc, so it may burn discs
more successfully. In any case, you won’t have to render all that video again
before you try to burn another disc—you just use the encoded movie that’s in
the folder.
You can’t use this option with Blu-ray discs.
6. Type in a disc or folder name such as LOLA_SPLASH.
If you don’t change the disc or folder name, Premiere uses a number. By tradi-
tion, people usually name discs with all capital letters and underscores in the
place of spaces. You can do whatever you please.
7. Check and set the Burner Location.
When you click the Disc button, Premiere scans your computer for drives capable
of burning DVD or Blu-ray discs. Those names appear on the Burner Location
drop-down menu. It also checks to see if you have a blank disc in the drive; if you
don’t, you’ll notice the Burn button is grayed out. Put in a fresh disc and click the
Rescan button to have Premiere check for drives and discs a second time.
8. In the Copies box, enter the number of discs you want to create.
As you might guess, this option is deselected if you write your movie to a PC
folder. If you know you want to create a bunch of DVDs, use this option
because it only has to go through the time-consuming process of encoding your
movie once. After that, burning multiple discs goes fairly quickly.
9. Change the Presets menu to match your project.
The options includes standard and widescreen frames in NTSC or PAL formats.
10.(Optional) Check the Fit Contents to available space box.
If you’ve got a really big video project, it may not fit on a DVD or Blu-ray disc.
In that case, check this box and Premiere compresses the video as best it can to
make it fit. Keep in mind that DVDs and Blu-ray discs have a tremendous
amount of storage, as explained in the box on page 359.
11. (Optional) Set the Video Quality slider to Highest Quality.
In most cases, your video will fit on a single disc. You can leave the quality box
unchecked or you can set the slider to Highest Quality. The result is the same:
Premiere burns uncompressed video to the disc. If you’re curious about how
much space your video takes, check the size estimate listed under the slider.

12. Click the Burn button.
Premiere encodes your video and then burns the files onto the DVD or Blu-ray

you know if the procedure was successful or (gulp) if it failed.
Once you burn your disc, you can take it out of your computer and pop it into a
player. The video and the menus should look spectacular.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
At the Disc Store
There are all these different types of discs, which ones
should I buy?
You can buy DVDs and Blu-ray discs at computer or office-
supply stores. You can also find some pretty good deals
online. You may be surprised at the number of choices fac-
ing you, however.
First of all, DVDs and Blu-ray discs may look the same, but
they’re really different beasts, as explained in the box on
page 359. Blu-ray discs use different machines and technol-
ogy to read and write discs. Blu-ray players can read DVDs,
but DVD players are stymied when you pop a Blu-ray disc
in the tray.
The main trick to buying either DVD or Blu-ray blank discs
is to make sure the blanks are compatible with your com-
puter and with your player. In the PC/Windows world, most
newer DVD burners are compatible with a wide range of
discs. That’s true with newer DVD players, too. Still, to avoid
problems, double-check your computer and player manu-
als to see what discs are compatible. Here are the formats
you’ll find at the store for DVD discs:
• DVD-R. The most common type of blank DVD disc,
these will play on the widest variety of DVD players.
These discs are single-sided and hold about 4.7
gigabytes of information. You can write to them
once, but you can’t erase them and re-write them.
• DVD+R. Very similar to the DVD-R format, these are
also single-sided, write-once discs. Occasionally, you
may find older computers or DVD players that can’t
handle this format.
• DVD-RW or DVD+RW. These are much like the pre-
viously mentioned discs, except for one remarkable
feature: You can erase these discs and reuse them.
Again, there are some older DVD players that may
not be able to read these discs (or they may prefer
one of these two formats over another).
• DVD+R DL. Here, the “DL” stands for “double-layer,”
and that means these discs hold nearly twice as
much information (8.5 gigs instead of 4.7) as the
single-layer discs referred to above. You need to
have a dual-layer DVD burner in your computer to
make use of these high-capacity, write-once discs.
Most newer DVD players can play these discs once
you burn them.
Thankfully, Blu-ray discs haven’t gone through the disc for-
mat battles that confused the blank DVD market. Here are
your choices in Blu-ray blank discs. You must have a Blu-ray
disc burner to create these discs—a DVD burner won’t know
what to do.
• BD-R. Your basic blank write-once Blu-ray disc holds
25 gigabytes.
• BD-R DL. A double-layer Blu-ray disc holds about 50
gigabytes.
• BD-RE. These are rewritable discs that hold 25 gigs
of data.
If you’re feeling smug because you’ve got a good handle on
the three types of Blu-ray writable discs, be forewarned:
Manufacturers are already considering ways to create Blu-
ray discs with even higher capacities. Additions to the family
are inevitable.

Archive Your
Project
Archive Your Project
After you successfully create a video or shared your movie using one of other
options in Chapters 12 or 14, you may want to archive your project. Sure, you’ve
got your raw clips stored on your hard drive, but that doesn’t back up your final
project file and all its clips in a single location. By archiving your project, you’re in
better shape to recreate or make changes to your project. Once you save your
project to an archive folder, you can copy it to an external hard drive, an online
storage location, or to a DVD or Blu-ray disc. Best of all, archiving is pretty easy
and painless.
With your project open in Premiere, choose File ➝Project Archiver. The two radio
buttons at the top offer you a choice (Figure 13-17). Select the top button to
archive the project and all the clips used in the timeline. Choose the second option,
Copy Project, if you want to archive all the files in your project, in the timeline or
not. Perhaps you imported a clip while the project was open or you tried a clip in
the timeline and removed it. In that case, Premiere includes the clip in your project
even if it isn’t in your timeline.
The next decision is where you want to store the archive file. Click the Browse but-
ton to choose a folder. If necessary, you can create a new folder. The Disk Space
box shows the available space on your drive, along with how much space the
archive requires.
That’s about all there is to it. Click the OK button, and Premiere saves the files in
the designated folder. If you want to be ultra-safe, copy your archive files to a disc,
an online storage location, or a removable hard drive.
Figure 13-17:
The Project Archiver window, shown here, helps
you copy your project file and media clips to a
single location. Once you’ve got everything in one
folder, it’s a good idea to store a copy of this
archive to a disc, online storage location, or a
removable hard drive.

Do you think Thomas Edison, the Lumière Brothers, or any other film pioneer
ever imagined people would be walking around with movie projectors in their
pockets? Not to mention the fact that portable devices like the iPod, Sony PSP, and
Zune can hold not one, but dozens of movies.
If you have even a passing familiarity with consumer electronics, it probably
doesn’t surprise you that these movie machines, each from a different manufac-
turer, have different specs and play different types of video files. This chapter gives
you the rundown for saving your video in the formats used by the myriad mobile
gadgets out there. When you use Premiere’s handy presets, the process is easy and
the steps are pretty much the same regardless of the gadget. This chapter provides
step-by-step process for a couple of popular units—Apple’s iPhone, iPod, and
iPod Touch, and Sony’s PSP. You’ll find out how to save movies for other hand-
helds, including cellphones, too. If you have a tape-based camcorder, you may
want to archive your project to tape, so this chapter explains how to export your
edited video back to DV or HDV videotape.
And finally, you’ll learn how to save your finished film to your PC. There are
plenty of good reasons why you might want to do so. You may want to keep a copy
to watch or review while you’re at your desk, or you may want to put several mov-
ies on a DVD or Blu-ray disc and add each one to the timeline from your PC.

In the old days, folks used to have pictures of their family in their wallet. With a lit-
tle prompting, they’d bring them out to show you shots of Amy’s birthday party or
their vacation in the Bahamas. Today’s version of that form of social interaction is
to pull out your iPhone and show them a video. “It’s hard to believe she’s so grown
up.” “You wouldn’t believe how blue the water is!”
When you want to export your edited video to a handheld device like an iPod,
PSP, or other player, you have to jump two hurdles:
• Encode your movie in the proper format. Your Sony PSP doesn’t want the
video you encoded for your cellphone. Your iPod Touch expects a video that
uses the H.264 codec and AAC audio. You get the point. These handhelds are
persnickety about the video formats they’re willing to play. As mentioned in
Chapter 11 (page 320), “codec” is short for “compressor/decompressor”. A
codec is a program that compresses your video when you save it as a file and
decompresses it when you play it on a device.
• Copy your movie to the handheld device’s memory. Once you’ve gotten the
video properly encoded, you need to copy it onto the device. Often, you can do
that from inside of Premiere, but in some cases you may need (or want) to use
the software that came with your device.
Encode Movies for Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPod
Apple jumped into the video pool in a big way with its iPhone, iPod Touch, and
iPod. If you have one of these devices, you’re probably well aware of the video
offerings in Apple’s iTunes store. If you want to move your own features and fea-
turettes onto one of them, the first thing you need to do is encode your movie
using the codecs and settings that Apple’s gadgets understand. As the steps below
show, Premiere does most of the hard work for you. All you have to do is choose
the right preset:
1. Click the Share tab.
The “Start a new share” panel shows you five ways to share your movie. One of
the options is Mobile Phones and Players.
2. Click the Mobile Phones and Players button.
The Share tab changes to show a scrolling list of handheld devices at the top, as
shown in Figure 14-1. Premiere changes the preset options and other settings it
uses to encode a movie depending on your choice.
3. In the scrolling list, choose “Apple iPod and iPhone”.
The drop-down menu beside “Presets” gives you two options—one for high-
quality video, the other for medium-quality.

Chapter 14: Export to an iPod, Cellphone, or Other Device
367
Export to Devices
4. Click “iPod and iPhone – High Quality”.
In most cases, you should choose the high-quality option. However, if you have
an older iPod or need to conserve space on your current one, you may want to
choose medium-quality.
5. In the File Name box, type in a title, like Lola’s Big Splash.
Premiere makes sure you only use characters that are “legal” for filenames. For
example, you can’t use a question mark or an asterisk in a name.
6. Click the Browse button and then select the folder where you want to save the file.
If you don’t change anything, Premiere puts your movie in your Documents
folder. That’s not a bad location. It’s easy to find when you’re ready to import
the file to iTunes or your iPod.
7. (Optional) Check the “Share WorkArea Bar Only” box.
As with any of the Share methods, you can choose to export just a portion of
your movie. To do that, adjust the WorkArea bar at the top of the timeline, as
shown in Figure 14-2. It’s a little hard to see because it, like most of the time-
line, is gray.
8. Click Save.
Premiere begins encoding your movie. A progress bar appears in the panel to
entertain you while you wait. When Premiere finishes, you’ll find your file
saved in your Documents folder.
Figure 14-1:
Choose your device in the
scrolling list at the top of the
screen and then choose a
preset. As you make your
choices, Premiere displays
some of the techie details for
the encoding process. Here
you can see that Premiere will
use the H.264 codec. The
frame size is 640 × 480, and
the frame rate is 30 fps.

Once Premiere encodes and saves your video as a file on your computer, you can
view it using a media player such as Windows Media Player, QuickTime, or
iTunes. You’ll find that, like your gadgets, some media players won’t read a certain
type of file. For example, Apple’s QuickTime Player might not like Microsoft’s
WMV files. When that happens, the simplest thing to do is use a different player.
Tip: If you’d like to have one media player that plays just about every type of video and audio file,
including DVDs and their VOB files, you may want to download the free VideoLAN VLC media player
(www.videolan.org). Versions are available for Windows PCs, Macs, and Linux computers.
Copy Video to an Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPod
The encoding part of the process is complete. As explained earlier, the next hurdle
is to move the video file from your Documents folder to your iPhone, iPod Touch,
or iPod. Happily, all these devices use the handy iTunes program to move a file
from computer to gadget.
1. Connect your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPod to your computer.
Depending on how you’ve got things set up, iTunes may start automatically
when you plug in your device.
2. If not, fire up iTunes.
Find your player listed in iTunes’ “Devices” list and select it.
3. Choose File ➝ Add File to Library (or press the shortcut key Ctrl+O).
A file browser window opens. From there, navigate to the Documents folder (or
any other location on you computer).
4. Select the video file you want to import. For example, Lola’s Big Splash.mp4.
Then, click Open.
iTunes churns a little and then begins to import your video to the Movies folder
in iTunes. A progress bar appears at the top of the iTunes window.
If you see a warning saying that iTunes couldn’t copy the file, that means
iTunes and your device can’t read the video file format you chose.

At this point, your iTunes experience may differ from these steps depending on
your synchronization settings. If you’ve got a classic iPod with 120 gigabytes of
storage, you may have set it up to automatically copy everything in the iTunes
library to your iPod. If you have an iPhone or iPod Touch with more modest
capacity, you may have it set up so that you manually copy items from the
library to the gadget. (For some tips on using iTunes, see the box on page 370.)
The next step explains how to manually copy a movie from the iTunes library to
an Apple device.
5. Drag the movie from Library ➝Movies to Devices ➝[your device] ➝Movies
(Figure 14-3).
A progress bar appears at the top of the iTunes window to report the status of
the transfer. When you’re done, you have a copy of the movie in both your
iTunes library and on your Apple gadget. You can eject your iPod or continue
to copy more items.
Audio Podcast for iPod Playback
If you’re one of the many celebrities producing an audio podcast, you may want to
consider using Premiere as your production studio. You can film your podcast and
then post the video version on YouTube (or your own website). Then, using Pre-
miere, you can create an audio-only version for distribution via iTunes. To do
that, after you edit your podcast, go to the same Share tab that Premiere uses for
exporting video. Click the Mobile Phones and Players button and then choose the
Audio Podcast option. When you do so, Premiere creates an audio-only file. It dis-
plays the podcast settings in the Share tab, as shown in Figure 14-5.
Figure 14-3:
If you don’t use iTunes’

You can choose from several different presets. The first two options produce MP4
files compatible with iTunes and Apple equipment. The last three create files in
MP3 format, which, in addition to being compatible with Apple gear, also works
for the whole wide MP3 world, including Windows-compatible products.
Here’s the list of preset options:
• Audio Podcast – High Quality
• Audio Podcast – Medium Quality
• MP3 Audio Podcast – High Quality
• MP3 Audio Podcast – High Quality Mono
• MP3 Audio Podcast – Medium Quality
The rest of the screen displays file-saving and specification information similar to
those you see when you share video files, as explained on page 368. You provide a

iTunes Tips and Tricks
iTunes is a pretty complete media-management program
and as such, it has quite a few tricks up its sleeve. If you
want to learn all that things iTunes and your favorite gadget
can do, get the book iPod: The Missing Manual by Jude
Biersdorfer and David Pogue or iPhone: The Missing Man-
ual by David Pogue.
As mentioned in the steps on page 369, iTunes can auto-
matically copy movies from your Library ➝Movies folder
to your Apple device if you have its AutoSync feature turned
on, or you can move items manually. Select your iPhone,
iPod Touch, or iPod under “Devices” in iTunes, then click
the Summary tab. There are two check boxes that deter-
mine the way iTunes manages music and video:
• Manually manage music and videos. If you want
to be in charge of what gets copied to your gadget,
check this box. This option works well for a device
with less storage space than high-capacity iPods,
such as the iPhone or iPod Touch. Using this
method, you copy movies to your iPod by dragging them
from the Library to the ’Pod (see Figure 14-3). To
remove movies, right-click the movie and choose Delete.
Turn off the “Manually manage music and videos”
checkbox, and iTunes automatically syncs the music
and videos in iTunes with your iPod. This is great as
long as everything that’s on your computer will fit on
your iPod. If you like the idea of iTunes automati-
cally copying media to your iPod but have some
space concerns, check out the next option.
• Sync only checked songs and videos. When you
select this box, you control what files iTunes auto-
matically copies to your iPod. Go to the Movies tab
and then check the Sync Movies box. Using the
radio buttons underneath, you can sync all your
movies or you can pick and choose. When you’re
managing your own movies, Selected is a good
choice. Then, just check the movies you want cop-
ied and leave the rest unchecked. When you’re
done, click Apply (see Figure 14-4).

Export to Sony PSP (PlayStation Portable)
The general steps for exporting video to a handheld device are pretty much the
same regardless of the device. Premiere simplifies the technical details by wrap-
ping them up in a preset. Your job is only as tough as remembering the name of
your gadget. You can use the software that came with your handheld, or in some
cases you may be able to copy files directly as you encode them.
Here are the steps for encoding and copying a movie to a Sony PSP:
1. Connect your PSP to your computer via the USB cable and turn it on.
When it’s connected to your computer, Windows treats the PSP as if it were a
removable hard drive. You can see it in Windows Explorer and other programs
that list your available drives and storage devices.
2. In Premiere, click the Share tab.
The “Start a new share” panel shows you five ways to share your movie. One of
the options is Mobile Phones and Players.
3. Click “Mobile Phones and Players”.
The Share tab changes to show a scrolling list of handheld devices at the top. The
preset options and other settings change depending on your choice (Figure 14-6).
4. In the scrolling list, choose Sony PSP.
The Share panel displays the preset settings for the Sony PSP.
5. Under Presets, choose “Sony PSP – High Quality”.
At the bottom of the Share panel, you can see some of the technical details for
this setting. Sony, like Apple, uses the H.264 codec, which creates good-quality
video while keeping the file size to a minimum. The frame size is set to 320× 240,
and the frame rate is shown as 29.97, the standard for NTSC TV. You also see
the settings for audio compression. At the bottom, Premiere displays a file size
estimate and the duration of the video.
6. Type in a filename for your video, such as Lola’s Big Splash.
You can use any characters that are legal for a Windows/PC file.
7. Next to “Save in”, click the Browse button.
The Browse for Folder window opens.
8. Click “Computer” to expand the list underneath.
Your storage devices appear in the list (see Figure 14-7).
9. Click the triangle next to the drive letter for your handheld device.
The folders in your handheld device appear in the list. If you don’t know the
drive letter for your device, see the box on page 374.

10.Select the Video folder and click OK.
This is where the Sony PSP stores video. You’re likely to see a different name if
you’re copying video to another type of handheld.
Once you click OK, a new file path appears next to “Save in” in the Share panel.
11. Click Save.
Premiere encodes your video for the PSP and stores the file in the PSP’s video
folder. Next time you browse for videos on your PSP, you’ll see it listed.
You can use these same steps for any device that shows up as removable storage
device in Windows. The only thing you need to change is the preset.
Save Your Movie to Other Devices
If your handheld device is listed in the Share tab’s scrolling panel, you’re in great
shape. All you have to do is select the device and one of the presets, and you won’t
have to fiddle with any other technical details related to codecs, frame sizes, or
frame rates. As a matter of fact, you don’t want to click that advanced button and
Figure 14-6:
Whether you’re sharing to a mobile
phone, an iPod, or a Zune, the Share
tab looks pretty much the same. All
you need to do is choose a preset

selected device.

374
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Export to Devices
start fiddling with the settings, because, chances are, you’ll end up creating a video
file that won’t work in your Zune, iPod, Creative Zen, or whatever gadget.
The only case where you might have to make additional adjustments is when your
device isn’t listed in the panel. In that case, start off by digging out the manual for
your handheld. Find the specifications for the video format. The most important
details you need to look up include:
• File container. This is the file format that holds your movie’s video and audio
streams. Examples include DV AVI, Windows Media (.wmv), and Quick-
Time (.mov).

How to Identify Your Portable Device
When you connect a device like a Sony PSP to your com-
puter, Windows doesn’t necessarily refer to it by name. In
most cases, it identifies it as a drive letter, such as G:.
If you aren’t sure what name Windows gives your device,
try this: Before you connect, double-click the Computer
icon on the Windows desktop, (or go to Start ➝My Com-
puter). Windows Explorer opens, showing you all the drives
connected to your PC, as you can see in Figure 14-5.
Make a quick note of the drives and then plug in your PSP
or other gadget. You should hear a tone when Windows
recognizes the device, and you should see a new item
under the Removable Storage section in Explorer, labeled
with a drive letter. If you don’t see any changes in Windows
Explorer, try pressing F5, the refresh key. Use the new drive
letter when you want to Share video to the device.

• Video codec. This is the video compression system your device is compatible
with; it makes video streams smaller.
• Audio codec. This is the audio compression system your device is compatible
with; it makes audio streams smaller.
• Frame size. For handhelds you’re likely to see frame sizes from 176 × 144 (for
mobile phones) up to 640 × 480 (for an iPod).
• Frame rate. A frame rate around 30 is common for devices that display video. Other
devices that are merely video-capable may prefer a frame rate of around 15 fps.
So, if your manual explains that your handheld uses Windows Media files, then
you use the scrolling list to choose one of the presets that write to that format, such
as Creative Zen, Microsoft Zune, or Pocket PC. If you know you want an H.264
file type, choose the Mobile Phone or the Apple iPod and iPhone option.
Once you make a selection in the scrolling list, click the Advanced button, and the
Export Settings window opens (Figure 14-9). At the top, you’ll see Format, Preset,
and Comments labels. The format is set to match the preset you selected a minute
ago, and you may not be able to change that. Use the checkboxes to determine
whether you’re exporting video and/or audio.
Below these options, the Summary panel provides details on the export settings.
For example, you might see something like: NTSC, 320x240, 29.97 [fps] Progres-
sive. Translation: the video is NTSC (as opposed to PAL), the frame size is 320 ×
240, and it uses the standard American TV frame rate of 29.97 fps. The video is
progressive rather than interlaced (see page 380). Additional summary details give
you info on the audio and other compression settings. As you make changes in the
tabs and panels below, this summary reflects those changes.

The settings and options shown on the three tabs underneath the Summary panel
change depending on the preset you choose. For example, if you start off with the
iPhone presets, you see different settings than you will if you start off with the
Zune presets. Here’s a general description of what you find on the tabs:
• Multiplexer tab. These setting affect the way audio and video is combined in
the video file. You may see Multiplexing menus where you can choose between
MP4 (for Apple gear) or 3GPP (for phones). In other cases, you may have
options to create compressed or uncompressed video.
• Video tab. You can customize your video settings by choosing a codec, frame
size, and frame rate. You’ll also find options for adjusting the pixel aspect ratio.
For more details on the differences in pixel aspect ratios, see page 316.
• Audio tab. Under the audio tab you can choose a codec for compressing audio
and change some of the other settings that affect audio quality and file size. For
example, you may be able to choose between stereo and mono audio tracks.

After you make changes in the Export settings window to match your device, click
OK. The Choose Name box appears where you must give the new preset a name.
After all, you don’t want to mess up the perfectly good preset you started with.
Click OK in the Choose Name box, and you’ve officially created your own preset.
Premiere lists it with all the others. So, if you started off by modifying the generic
Mobile Phone preset, you’ll find your new preset listed with all the other Mobile
Phone presets in the drop-down menu. It’s no surprise that saving a video for your
cellphone is like saving a video for other handhelds. Click the Share tab and choose
the Mobile Phones and Players option. In the list, scroll down to Mobile Phones.
Use the Presets menu to choose one of the Presets that came with Premiere or one
that you created. At that point, all you have to do is give your video a name and
choose where you want to save it.
It’s probably no surprise that saving a video to your cell phone is like saving one to
the other handhelds discussed here. Click the Share tab and choose the Mobile
Phones and Players option. In the list, scroll down to Mobile Phones. Use the Pre-
sets menu to choose one of the Presets that came with Premiere or one that you
created. At that point, all you have to do is give your video a name and choose a
save location.
Export to Videotape
Exporting your movie to videotape is certainly not as common as exporting it to
an iPod. But, if you’ve got a DV or HDV camcorder, there may be times when you
want to copy your movie back to videotape. For example, you may use DV tapes to
archive your projects. They’re fairly inexpensive, they’re small, and they’re durable.
In other cases, you may be working with a video production house that prefers
working with DV or HDV tape.
Writing video to your camcorder reverses the workflow you used to get video from
your camcorder into your computer. In fact, you can use the same “device control”
feature discussed earlier to record to tape (see page 43). Connect your camcorder
to your PC. Fire up Premiere and, with a couple of clicks, you can have Premiere
control the recording features of your camera.
Before You Export to Tape
Sometimes when you export to tape, you want to make sure there’s a little leader (a
few black frames) at the beginning and the end of your movie. If a production
house uses the tape to make copies, you may want to add color bars and tone at the
beginning, so they can calibrate their copying device. As an example, here are the
steps to add color bars and tone to your video:
1. With your edited project open in Premiere, click the Organize tab and then
click the Project button.
The Project panel displays all the media in your project. In the upper-right cor-
ner, you’ll see a curled-page icon. Position your cursor over it, and a tool tip
displays its name (“New Item”) before a drop-down menu appears.

378
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Export to Videotape
2. Position the playhead where you want to insert the color bars and tone.
Most likely, you want the color bars to play for 30 seconds at the beginning of
your movie, so press Home to move the playhead to frame 0.
3. Click the New Item menu and choose “Bars and Tone”.
Premiere inserts the bars and tone clip into the timeline, but it probably isn’t set
to run for 30 seconds.
4. Drag the right edge of the Bars and Tone clip so that it runs at least 30 seconds.
This gives the production house enough time to use the signal to make their
adjustments.
You use similar steps to add leader (black frames) or a universal countdown leader
to your movie. Just position the playhead and choose the appropriate option
(Black Video or Universal Counting Leader) from the New Item menu.
Copy to DV or HDV Tape
Once you have your movie edited with the leader in place, it’s time to send it back
to your camcorder:
1. Connect your camcorder to your computer using the Firewire (IEEE 1394)
cable.
Make sure you’ve got a tape in the camcorder and the tape is at a location where
you want to start recording.
2. Turn your camcorder on and set it to VTR, VCR, or Play mode.
If your computer didn’t recognize your camcorder when you plugged it in, it
should do so when you turn the power on.
3. With your edited project open in Premiere, click the Share tab.
Premiere shows you several options for sharing video. The last item listed is
Tape Record to DV or HDV tape.
4. Click “Tape”.
The Export to Tape window opens, as shown in Figure 14-10.
5. Choose your export-to-tape options.
Premiere presets the most important one, “Activate Recording Device”. This
option gives Premiere control over your camcorder. You may not need to
change any of the other settings, but here’s a quick rundown:
• Assemble at timecode. Use this option to start recording to a specific loca-
tion on your videotape.

Chapter 14: Export to an iPod, Cellphone, or Other Device
379
Export to Videotape
• Delay movie start. If you find that you’re losing a few frames at the begin-
ning of your movie, experiment with this setting by adding a few frames.
• Preroll x Frames. If you use the option to “Assemble at timecode”, you may
want to use this option to get your camcorder up to speed before it begins to
record.
• Abort After x Dropped Frames. Recording back to tape isn’t always a per-
fect operation. If your computer and camcorder aren’t in harmony, you may
experience dropped (unrecorded) frames. Use this option to tell Premiere the
number of dropped frames you’re willing to tolerate.
• Report Dropped Frames. Most likely, Premiere already checked this option,
meaning that you’ll see the number of dropped frames in the Export Status
box during the recording process.
6. Click Record.
Premiere starts off by rendering any unrendered video. Then, it starts up the
camcorder, and your movie plays back while the camcorder records it. You can
follow the progress on either your computer monitor or the camcorder screen.
There’s no way to speed up the process, so an hour-long movie takes an hour to
record.
7. Afterward, click Stop and then close the Export to Tape box.
When you’re finished, you can review the tape on your camcorder using its
playback controls.
Figure 14-10:
Most of the time, the settings on the Export to Tape panel are
ready to go. All you have to do is click Record to start the process
and then Stop when you’re through. The panel shown here is in
the middle of a recording session, so the Record/Stop button is
labeled Stop.

Save Movies to Your PC
As explained in this chapter and some of the earlier ones, if you’re ready to send
your video to DVD or Blu-ray disc, a website, or an iPod, your best bet is to choose
those options in the Share tab and then use the presets Premiere provides. That
way, you don’t have to worry about all the technical details.
If you’re not ready to send your video in one of those directions, you may want to
save it as a computer file. You’ll have a copy you can watch on your PC, and then
later on maybe you’ll burn it to a DVD, upload it to a website, or bring it back into
Premiere to use for another movie. Once you save your movie as a computer file,
you can move it and copy it just as you would any other file on your PC. For
example, you could copy the file to a USB thumb drive to move it to another com-
puter or take it to a friend’s house.
The steps for exporting your movie as a PC file are similar to the other Share
options. You click the Share tab, choose Personal Computer, and then choose one
of the file formats and presets Premiere offers (Figure 14-11).
Knowing which file format to choose is the trickiest part of the process, because
different file formats are better for different jobs. In fact, these are the same for-
mats Premiere uses to create video for discs, the Web, and iPods. Here’s a description
of each, along with a note about where they shine:
• Adobe Flash Video is the format to choose if you want to put your video on a
website at some point because it’s become the de facto standard for delivering
video over the Web. YouTube, Hulu, and CBS all use Flash to play video.
Tip: If you ever want to see if a website uses Flash video, right-click the video and look for a menu
option that says something like “About Adobe Flash 10.”
• MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) is a good option for making high-quality
video files for a few destination devices. Choose this, and you’ll see that there are
several presets in the drop-down menu. That’s due to the nature of ever-evolving
standards. Choose one of the NTSC DVD presets to create a DVD-quality video
file. Using this format, you have a choice of standard or widescreen. If you want a
Blu-ray–quality file, choose H.264 1920 × 1080i 30. What do all those numbers
mean? H.264 is the codec used to compress the video. 1920 × 1080i is the resolu-
tion or number of pixels used to create the image. The i at the end of the resolution
indicates the video is interlaced—the video image is created in two passes, odd
numbered lines then even numbered lines. The last number 30 is the frame rate,
as in 30 frames per second.
• AVI is the file format Premiere uses as you edit your video. It’s a good format to
choose if you want to save your video to your computer because the video qual-
ity is good. It’s also a good format if you plan to bring it back into Premiere to
use in other projects.

Save Movies to Your
PC
• Windows Media files (.WMV) use Microsoft’s video file format, designed for
streaming video from a website or emailing videos. You can’t edit .WMV files,
but they are compact.
• QuickTime is a good format if you’re planning on sharing video with friends
who use Macs. Apple’s format works well for all sorts of projects. The files are a
little bigger than Windows Media files, but the image looks great. The snazzy
QuickTime player comes preinstalled on every Mac. For PC users, the Quick-
Time player is automatically installed if they have iTunes on their computer.
For those few folks who don’t have QuickTime already installed on their com-
puter, it’s a free download from www.apple.com/quicktime/download/.
• Image converts your movie into a series of still images or a single still.
• Audio is the option to choose when you want to save only a movie’s sound, not
its video.

If you’ve used the Share tab to send your movie to a disc, website, or handheld
gadget, you probably already know the drill. But just in case, here are the steps to
save your movie as a file on your computer:
1. Click the Share tab.
The “Start a new share” panel displays your options.
2. Click Personal Computer.
The “PC: Choose location and settings” panel appears. The scrolling list at the
top displays the PC file formats you can use.
3. Choose one of the file formats listed on page 380.
When you click on any of the options in the scrolling list, the Presets menu dis-
plays different options. Once you choose a format, Premiere displays a descrip-
tion of it, along with other details, at the bottom of the panel.
4. Choose a preset from the drop-down menu.
The presets vary depending on the file format, but usually you can zero in on a
specific resolution and choose a widescreen or standard format.
5. In the File Name text box, type in a catchy name like Puerto Vallarta Days and
Nights.
Make sure it’s a name that helps you identify the file three or four years from
now.
6. Click the Browse button and choose a folder where you want to save your file.
Initially, Premiere chooses your Documents folder. You may want to change
that to your Videos or any other folder.
7. (Optional) Click Share WorkArea Bar Only.
You can choose to make a file from just a portion of the video in the timeline.
This is a handy way to test a file format to make sure it meets your needs.
Adjust the work area bar over the portion of video you want to save, as shown
in Figure 14-2. Then check the “Share WorkArea Bar Only” box.
8. Click Save.
The panel displays a progress bar while it encodes the video according to your
specifications. When it’s done, Premiere displays the message “Save Complete”.
At this point, your movie is ready for your viewing pleasure.

Elements 8
When you edit video, you make your computer work hard—really hard. Not only
is its processor pushing around tons of information to put a picture on your screen
30 times a second, its hard drives juggle enormous video files, audio files, still
images, titles, transitions, and effects. And every time you make an edit, Premiere
has to update your project file, which keeps track of all the little pieces.
Fortunately, when it comes to video editing, today’s computers are much more
capable than their ancestors. Underpowered netbooks aside, PC manufacturers
make the brains behind today’s PCs (the CPU, or central processing unit) with
video needs in mind. Hard drives are bigger and faster. Video display cards (some-
times called GPUs, or graphics processing units) do lots of their own processing,
taking some of the load off of the CPU. And Premiere takes advantage of all these
advances.
This appendix is all about getting Premiere up and running on your computer.
You’ll learn what kind of horsepower you need and find tips for making the pro-
gram run smoothly. In the last part of this appendix are step-by-step instructions
for installing Premiere.

Software publishers list the minimum system requirements for their programs on
the package, but they tend to fudge them a little because they want to sell their pro-
gram to as many customers as possible. Also, different people have different tolerances
for the speed at which programs work.

create files in high-definition video (HDV) format or to burn Blu-ray discs.
You’ll need a dual-core processor if you want to create video in the more rigor-
ous AVCHD (Audio Video Compression for HD) format.
• Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, or Windows 7.
• Memory requirements:
— For Windows XP: 512MB of RAM (2GB if you want to create HDV,
AVCHD, or Blu-ray video).
— For Windows Vista: 1GB of RAM (2GB for HDV, AVCHD, or Blu-ray
video).
— For Windows 7: 1GB of RAM (2GB for HDV, AVCHD, or Blu-ray video).
— 4.5 GB of available hard-disk space.
• Color monitor with 16-bit color video card.
• 1024 × 768 monitor with 16-bit color video card.
• Microsoft DirectX 9- or 10-compatible sound and display driver.
• DVD-ROM drive (you need a compatible DVD burner if you want to burn
DVDs, and a compatible Blu-ray burner to burn Blu-ray discs).
• DV/i.LINK/FireWire/IEEE 1394 interface to connect a Digital 8 DV or HDV
camcorder, or a USB2 interface to connect a DV-via-USB compatible DV cam-
corder (other video devices supported via the Media Downloader).
• QuickTime 7 software.
UP TO SPEED
Deﬁnitions for Premiere’s System Requirements
Adobe may expect you to know all these terms, but your
friendly Missing Manual doesn’t:
• SSE2 is a bit of video-processing smarts that Intel
added to its processors starting with the Pentium 4.
What does it stand for? Streaming SIMD Extensions 2.
Aren’t you sorry you asked?
• HDV is a high-definition video format.
• AVCHD is also a high-definition video format,
though it uses different technology. It stands for
Audio Video Compression for High Definition.

For a better Premiere Elements experience, here are a few hardware tips:
• Faster processors (CPUs) and dual-core processors are better. Surprising, huh?
(Processor speed is measured in gigahertz, or GHz.) Most new computers come
with dual- or quad-core processors, which is like having two (or four) brains
working at the same time. That’s good for video editing.
If you have a single-core processor, all is not lost, though it’s best if you have a
3GHz or better CPU. The speed rating on dual-core processors is often lower than
that of single-core CPUs, but overall the dual-cores perform faster because the two
brains split the workload and then work simultaneously. So, when you edit video, a
2.4GHz dual-core processor outperforms a 3GHz single-core processor.
• The best operating system for video editing is Windows 7. If upgrading to this
latest version of Windows isn’t an option, working with XP or Vista is fine.
(Some folks are leery of constantly updating their operating systems as
Microsoft pumps out fixes for this and that in Windows. Don’t be. Keep Win-
dows and Premiere up-to-date by installing any updates the companies publish.)
Tip: To see which version of Windows you have on your computer, right-click the Computer icon on
your desktop and choose “Properties”.
• When you edit video, more memory makes everything go faster. Measured in
gigabytes, 2GB of computer memory is good, but 4GB is even better. If you use
a 32-bit operating system (like Windows Vista Home Premium), you don’t
need more than 4GB. How do you know if you’re using a 32-bit OS? If you’re
not sure what you have, it’s probably 32-bit. The computer salesman would
have made a big deal of it if you’d bought a 64-bit system.
• Two big, fast internal hard drives are great for editing video. Premiere requires
3GB or 4GB of hard drive space. But the issue really is all those big video files
you import from your camcorder and the temporary files Premiere creates so
you edit copies of your raw footage instead of the originals. All this means that
Premiere is always reading from and writing to disks as you edit.
• After you install Premiere, make sure you have at least 10GB of free space left on
your hard drive. It’s better to have much more. Ideally, your drive should never
use the last 10 percent of disk space. A good setup has Premiere and your project
file on one drive (probably the C: drive), and your raw clips and the scratch disks
(temporary files) on a separate internal hard drive (a 500GB or 1TB drive). Why
an internal drive? They transfer files faster than USB-connected drives.
• Video cards that come with their own processors take the video-processing
load off of your computer’s CPU. You don’t have to get the $500 card the kid
down the block uses for video games, but an nVidia card with 128MB (mega-
bytes) or more of memory can speed up processes like special effects without
breaking the bank.

• Use two monitors—or one widescreen monitor—and you’ll spend less time
opening and closing windows and panels. You can undock Premiere’s monitor
and timeline, which means you can move them to a second monitor or to
another spot on a widescreen monitor. This saves time and you get a bigger pic-
ture of your project.
Hard Drive Maintenance
As you edit in Premiere, your hard drives get a good workout. You can help them
out a bit by regularly optimizing them. Yeah, this is a really geeky topic and it
wouldn’t matter much if all you used your computer for was word processing or
browsing the Web. But when you edit video, keeping your drives in tip-top shape
makes a difference.
Optimizing your hard drives is also know as defragmenting (or “defragging”) them.
When computers save files to a hard drive, they indiscriminately break up the file
(with pointers to each piece) to use every available space—in other words, they
scatter bits and pieces of files all over the place. This fragmentation slows down
your computer when it reads and writes big files like videos because it has to do a
lot of running around to gather the pieces.
You can optimize your drives a couple of ways. The easiest one is to let a program
like Windows’ Disk Defragmenter or Norton 360 do it on a regular basis during
“quiet” periods when your PC isn’t busy with other tasks.
If you don’t want to do that, you can defrag your drives manually when you think
it’s necessary. One downside of optimizing drives manually is that you have to
remember to do it. And by the time you do remember, the disk can be pretty frag-
mented, the digital equivalent of scrambled eggs, so defragging may take a long
time (so long you might want to start the process at the end of the day and let it
continue overnight).
In either case, it doesn’t hurt to manually optimize your drives before you install
Premiere. If your drives are in good shape, the process goes quickly. If your drives
are a mess, it’s well worth the time. Here are the steps to manually optimize your
hard drives using Vista (the process is similar for XP and Windows 7).
Tip: Just got your copy of Premiere Elements and you don’t want to waste time with hard drive mainte-
nance now? You can go ahead and install the program and do the optimization later.
1. Double-click the Computer icon on your desktop.
Windows Explorer opens, showing you the hard drives and other storage
devices attached to your computer.
2. Right-click drive C: (or any other drive you want to optimize).
Windows displays the Properties panel for the drive, which includes a graph
showing how much used and free space your drive has.

Appendix A: Install Premiere Elements 8

Elements
3. Click the Tools tab.
Windows displays the tools it offers for hard drives, including “Defragmentation”.
4. Click the Defragment Now button.
Windows opens the Disk Defragmenter panel and begins analyzing your drive.
This panel also lets you set up a schedule to run the defragmenter automatically.
As the defragmenter examines your drives, it updates you with messages like
“Analyzing disk 3 of 5 (F:)”. After it’s done, a message appears telling you
whether you need to defragment your drives.
Note: Depending on how your computer is set up, Windows may display something called the User
Account Control (UAC) window. If it does, click Continue. If you can’t continue, you need to have some-
one with an administrator account help you with this project.
5. If any of your drives need defragmenting, click the Defragment Now button.
The Defragmenter runs until it optimizes all the drives. A message helpfully
explains that “This may take from a few minutes to a few hours.”
You can continue working while the Defragmenter runs. Most programs like the
Defragmenter are smart enough to run in the background as you read web pages
or ponder what to say next in the quarterly report. But if you find the Defrag-
menter interfering with your work, click the Cancel Defragmentation button. You
can always run it again later.
As you work with Premiere, you’ll constantly add new media files to your com-
puter. So from time to time, check your disks using the steps above and manually
defrag your disks when they get messy.
Install Premiere Elements
You can buy Premiere Elements as a boxed DVD or download it from the Adobe
website (www.adobe.com). If you have a decent Internet connection, the program
takes between a half hour and a couple of hours to download. If you’ve never used
Premiere before and don’t want to shell out the big bucks sight unseen, you can
download a test-drive of the program. After 30 days, if you want to keep using it,
you pony up for a serial number that makes your copy official and legal (you don’t
need to reinstall the program). If you get the boxed DVD, it includes a copy of
Photoshop Elements you can test drive.
If you download Premiere, double-click the downloaded file to start installing the
program. Premiere first unpacks all the setup files, meaning that it copies some tem-
porary files to your computer that it needs for installation. Then it begins the instal-
lation, which is similar to the steps described below for installation from a DVD.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Install Premiere
Elements
Adobe has been selling software for a long time and they’ve pretty much got the
whole installation procedure down so that it’s easy and there aren’t many pitfalls
for you or their product support people. Typical Adobe instructions say some-
thing like:
1. Close any other programs currently running, including your anti-virus software.
2. Put the installation disc in your DVD drive and follow the instructions.
And it’s about that simple. The DVD automatically loads and starts the installa-
tion process. Adobe keeps its instructions brief because the installation procedure
may change from time to time and it may be different in different parts of the
world—they probably don’t want to write a new set of installation instructions for
every product and every release.
That said, here’s a more detailed description of the installation process:
1. Put the Premiere Elements disc into your computer.
In most cases, the disc starts the installation process automatically. If it doesn’t,
double-click the Computer icon on your desktop, double-click the DVD, and
then double-click the file named Setup.exe.
2. Choose a language/location and click OK.
Use the drop-down menu to choose a language/country. That way, when the
program displays menus, help files, and other parts of the program, it does so in
your language. You may see a progress bar as Premiere unpacks some files.
Eventually, a new setup window opens.
3. Click Next.
This panel and some of the others have Back, Next, and Cancel buttons, as
shown in Figure A-1. You can use the Back and Next buttons to move back and
forth through the installation process (to go back and change the installation
location if you change your mind, for example). The Cancel button stops the
installation. After you click Next, the License Agreement appears.
4. Click Accept to agree to Adobe’s license.
The Adobe agreement is similar to that of most consumer software. You agree
that Adobe owns the program code (the digital instructions that make Pre-
miere work) and you’re only going to use it on one computer. Adobe gives you
permission to install a copy on a second computer, like a laptop, as long as you
use only one copy at a time.
5. Type in your name, choose a country (again), type in Premiere’s serial number,
and then click Next.
Adobe uses your name and serial number to keep track of the legitimate copies of
the program. If you downloaded the program, you were given a serial number
with your receipt. If you have the DVD boxed version, the number is on the box.

Appendix A: Install Premiere Elements 8
391

Elements
6. Choose your TV format (NTSC or PAL) and then click Next
In the Americas, the Caribbean, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, NTSC is the
video standard for TVs. In Europe, Russia, Africa, the Middle East, and other
parts of Asia, PAL is the standard.
7. Choose a destination folder for Premiere and then click Next.
Most of the time when you install a new program, it’s best to use the folder it
suggests. That way, any add-ons you might buy for the program (like addi-
tional templates for Premiere) can easily find the program because the add-ons
use the same default destination. Accepting Premiere’s default location puts
Premiere on your C: drive. After you click “Next”, a panel appears with details
about the Adobe License Activation.
8. Read the Activation info and then click the Install button.
The activation details explain that the installer program contacts Adobe over
the Internet to make sure it’s a legal copy. When you click Install, the actual
installation begins. A status bar keeps you apprised of the progress, which can
take a few minutes. Once the program is installed, one last window appears with
a couple of notes about QuickTime and other software components.
9. Click Finish.
A warning box explains that you need to restart your computer before you fire
up Premiere. Click the Yes button to restart, or click No to keep working and
restart your computer later.
Figure A-1:
Adobe uses your name and serial
number to track the legitimate
copies of the program. If you
download the program, Adobe
gave you a serial number along
with your receipt. If you bought
Premiere on DVD, the serial
number is on the DVD box.

Register Premiere Elements 8
After you restart your computer, you can run Premiere Elements by clicking the
Adobe Premiere Elements icon on your desktop. You may want to drag that icon
to the Windows QuickStart bar (or, depending on your version of Windows, to the
Taskbar) at the bottom of your screen so you can start Premiere with a single click.
The first time you start the program, Adobe encourages you to register it. Software
publishers like you to register programs because it gives them a way to keep track
of legal copies. It also gives them a list of potential customers for sibling programs.
Still, there are some benefits for you, too. You get details when they update your
program, and you may get deals on future software. So, unless you’re dedicated to
a life “off the grid,” go ahead and register.

Get Help for Premiere
Elements 8
Take a look at the credits at the end of a movie and you get an idea how many pros
it takes to make a Hollywood blockbuster. You probably won’t need quite that
much help when you work with your camcorder and Premiere, but it’s still good to
know where to turn when you need a second opinion. This appendix has two
parts: help you can get from Adobe, and help you can get from other sources.
Help from Adobe
You’re working along in Premiere and you have a question about a menu com-
mand, a preference setting, or the timeline. As with many Windows programs, you
can get help by pressing the F1 key (or clicking Help ➝Adobe Premiere Elements
Help). Premiere opens your browser and displays the help files shown in
Figure B-1. Unlike some other help systems, Premiere doesn’t show you help
related to what you were doing at that moment. Instead, when you press F1, it
takes you to the first page of Premiere Elements’ help. It’s up to you to find the
topic you need. The next section explains how.
Search Adobe’s Help Files
When you have Premiere’s help documents open, you can find the information
you need in a couple of ways. Adobe organizes the help files like a book, with a
table of contents on the left. Click the + buttons to expand the topics listed so you
can see their subtopics.

Help from Adobe
You’ll also find a search tool in the upper-right corner. Type in a word or two and
press the Enter key to see a list of pages related to the search terms. To limit your
search to the Premiere Elements 8 help files, check the box labeled “This Help sys-
tem only”. If you don’t check the box, the search includes the Adobe User Forums
and other websites (provided you’re connected to the Internet). Those sites have
some great info about Premiere, but it’s not always concise. They’re great resources
if you’re patient and want to learn more Premiere tips and tricks, but they can be
frustrating when you’re on deadline and need an answer quickly.
Two triangle buttons in the upper-right corner of the Help page move you from
one page to the next, as though you were thumbing through a book. The help files
don’t include a lot of pictures, and those they do include are very small. You can
enlarge most of ’em by clicking on them.
Print Your Own Help Docs
You can print your own Adobe Premiere Elements 8 help manual, but make sure
you stock your printer with plenty of paper. Check to see that you’re connected to
the Internet and then press F1 to open Premiere’s online help files. As shown in
Figure B-2, you’ll see a PDF icon in the upper-left corner, next to the words “View
Help PDF (adobe.com)”. Click the icon to open it in your web browser or right-
click it and save the file to a folder on your computer. You can open the saved file
in a browser or Adobe Reader and then print it from either program.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual gives you all the details, explanations,
and examples you need to create awesome movies. This appendix gives you a quick
description of every command in every Premiere menu.
Note: For menu-by-menu descriptions of Elements Organizer, see page 427.
File Menu
The File menu’s commands work on your Premiere projects as a whole. For exam-
ple, you can create new projects and open earlier ones. It’s also where you find
commands for the important job of importing and exporting media.
New
This menu item opens a submenu listing what you can create in Premiere, like
projects and folders.
Project (Ctrl+N)
When you start working in Premiere, you create a project file for your movie,
which holds your movie’s timeline and all its tracks. The project file keeps tabs on
all the media clips you use in your movie, but it doesn’t store the clips themselves.
Instead, it uses copies of your original clips as you edit (called “previews”) but
remembers where it stored the raw clips on your computer. When it’s time to cre-
ate a copy of your edited movie, Premiere uses your original clips. That way, you
always get the best quality video.

400
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
File Menu
Folder (Ctrl+/)
Use this command to create new folders when you’re in the Project panel (Windows ➝
Available Media). The Project panel displays all the clips you added to a project,
even if you’re not currently using all those clips in your movie. You can use the
folders to organize your clips; for example, you might create a folder that holds
unused clips. You can place folders inside of folders to create subfolders.
Tip: Another way to display the Project panel is to click the Organize tab and then click the Project button.
Title (F9)
Adds a 5-second clip at the playhead position in the timeline that features a text
box and a placeholder title (“Add Text”). Premiere puts the title on its own track.
You can edit and reformat the text.
Photoshop File
This command is grayed out if you don’t have Photoshop Elements installed. If
you do, use this command when you want to create or add still photos to your
project. When you select this command, your computer launches Photoshop Ele-
ments with a new, blank image file loaded and ready to go. The best part is the
image is perfectly sized for your project. You even see guidelines that show the
“video safe” and “title safe” margins.
Open Project (Ctrl+O)
Displays Premiere’s Open Project window, where you can browse through your
computer’s folders and open a saved project.
Open Recent Project
Click this command and you see a submenu listing the last five projects you’ve
opened. Click one of the project’s names to open it.
Close (Ctrl+W)
Closes your project. If you have any unsaved work, Premiere prompts you to save
it. After it closes your project, Premiere is still open and ready to work on another
project.
Save (Ctrl+S)
Saves changes you made to your project. If you haven’t made any changes, Pre-
miere dims this option. If you’ve never saved the project before, the command
works the same way as Save As (described next).

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
401
File Menu
Save As (Ctrl+Shift+S)
Saves the current project with a new name. After choosing the command, you see a
standard Explorer window where you can navigate to a different folder and type in
a new name. Once Premiere saves the file, the project is still open, but with a new
name.
Save a Copy (Ctrl+Alt+S)
Saves a copy of the current project with a new name. Just as with the Save As com-
mand, Premiere opens an Explorer-like window where you can choose a folder and
provide a filename for the copy. When you choose this command, your current
project remains open, not the newly saved copy.
Revert
Discards any changes you made to a project or media file since the last time you
saved it. This command is handy when you decide you’ve gone down the wrong
path and want things the way they were before. (It works only in Premiere, though,
not in real life.)
Get Media From
Click this important command to bring media clips into your project. A submenu
opens where you have these choices:
• DV Camcorder
• HDV Camcorder
• DVD (Camcorder or PC DVD Drive)
• Tapeless Camcorder (Hard disk or memory)
• Digital Still Camera
• Mobile Phone and Players
• Webcam or WDM Device
• PC Files and Folders
You can also import media by clicking the Organize tab and then clicking the Get
Media button. For more on importing media clips, see page 41.
Export
The Export command should be named Export Title because that’s the only type
of file it exports. (This changed from previous versions of Premiere Elements.)
Tip: If you want to Export a media clip, put it in the timeline, then go to Share ➝Personal Computer. At
that point, you can choose a file format and save the media clip. For more details, see page 380.

402
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Edit Menu
Project Archiver
Premiere Elements’ project files keep track of all the media clips you use in your
project. They don’t store copies of the original clips, but they know where those
files are on your computer. So what if you want to store all the bits and pieces
related to a movie in one place? Say you want to store all the data files on a DVD or
an external hard drive. In that case, use the Project Archiver command to save
your project file and all the media files associated with it in one location. You can
choose to save only the clips in your timeline or all the clips in your project,
including those that aren’t in the timeline.
Get Properties For
As you work, it’s often helpful to examine the properties of different media clips
and files. Click this command and Premiere opens a window where you can
browse through the folders on your computer and select files. Double-click a file-
name and Premiere opens a Properties window that provides details such as the
file’s format, image or frame size, frame rate, and audio specifications.
Interpret Footage
Use this command to mix video clips shot in different formats, such as when you
want to use HDV video in a Standard DV project. The Interpret Footage dialog box
lets you manually change a clip’s properties, such as the pixel aspect ratio and alpha
channel properties. Select a clip in the Project panel before using this command.
Exit (Ctrl+Q)
Closes any open project and then closes Premiere Elements itself. If you have
unsaved work in your project, Premiere prompts you to save it.
Edit Menu
The Edit menu includes the standard Copy, Cut, and Paste commands you’d
expect, and a whole lot more. The last item in this menu, in classic PC tradition,
lets you adjust the program’s settings.
Undo (Ctrl+Z)
This command undoes the last command you applied. So if you accidentally delete
a clip or commit an editing faux pas, this command can rescue you. Remember
Undo for those moments when you smack your forehead and say “Oh no! Why’d I
do that?” Premiere keeps track of your actions sequentially, so you can use this
command several times in a row to backtrack through your recent activity.

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
403
Edit Menu
Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z)
This command lets you undo the Undo command. If you undo an action or a
command and then decide you preferred it before the Undo, use the Redo com-
mand to get back to square one. You can use multiple Undos and Redos to move
back and forth through your recent Premiere activities.
Cut (Ctrl+X)
Removes the selected media clip or item and places a copy on your computer’s
Clipboard (temporary memory). Once it’s in the Clipboard, you can paste it to
another location.
Tip: The quickest way to use the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Clear commands is often through the shortcut
menu. Right-click a clip in the timeline or Project panel and these commands appear at the top of the pop-
up menu.
Copy (Ctrl+C)
Copies the selected media clip or item and places it in the Clipboard. The original
stays in place. Using this command to copy a clip on your timeline and paste a
duplicate in another location.
Paste (Ctrl+V)
Places the item in the Clipboard in the timeline or Project panel. If you’re working
in the timeline, the Paste command places the clip at the playhead’s position.
Tip: When you work with text like titles, the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands work just as they do in a
word processor.
Paste Insert (Ctrl+Shift+V)
This version of the Paste command inserts a clip in the Clipboard into the time-
line and shifts the other clips to make room.
Paste Attributes (Ctrl+Alt+V)
Use this time-saving command to paste the effects you applied to one media clip to
another clip. For example, if you want to use the colorful Find Edges effect on sev-
eral clips, apply it to one clip and fine-tune it. Then, copy the effect and use this
command to paste the Find Edges command to your other clips.
Clear (Shift+Delete)
Removes the selected item from the timeline, media, or Project panel. Unlike the
Cut command, Premiere doesn’t put the item in the Clipboard, so you can’t paste
it elsewhere. If you make a mistake with the Clear command, you can Undo
(Ctrl+Z) your action.

404
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Edit Menu
Delete and Close Gap (Backspace)
Removes a clip from the timeline and shifts the other clips to the left to close the
gap left by the deleted clip.
Duplicate (Ctrl+Shift+/)
Used in the Project panel, this command creates a duplicate of the selected media
clip in the Project panel.
Select All (Ctrl+A)
Selects all the media clips in the timeline, sceneline, media view, and Project panel.
Deselect All (Ctrl+Shift+A)
Deselects any media clips you’ve selected. This command works in the timeline
and the Project panel.
Find (Ctrl+F)
Use this command in the Project panel to open Premiere’s versatile Find panel, where
you can search for clips in your project. The Find panel lets you search specific file
attributes like name, description, and media type. You can limit the search results by
using qualifiers such as Contains, Starts With, Ends With, or Matches Exact.
Locate Media
Premiere project files store details about your media, including file locations. If
you move a media file or it’s otherwise inaccessible to Premiere, the clip shows up
in your project as an offline file. Use this command to locate it and reconnect it
with Premiere.
Label
You can use colored labels to help organize your clips. Premiere uses the color as a
background for clips in the timeline. To apply a label, select your clip then choose
a color from the Label submenu.
Select Label Group
Use the Select Label Group command to select all the clips that have the same
label. For example, in the timeline, click on a clip with a green label. Then choose
Edit ➝Label ➝Select Label Group and Premiere highlights all the clips in the
timeline that have a green label.

Edit Menu
Edit Original (Ctrl+E)
Use this command to open a media clip in a program other than Premiere. For
example, if you select a still photo and then choose Edit ➝Edit Original, Premiere
opens the photo file in Photoshop Elements or another photo-editing program.
Keyboard Customization
If you’re not happy with Premiere’s keyboard shortcuts, use this command to
change them. A window opens that displays every command and its current short-
cut (if it has one). You can select any command and type in a new shortcut. You
get a warning if you try to assign an existing shortcut.
Project Settings
When you create a new project in Premiere, you have to choose a Project preset,
which defines several of the project’s properties, such as the video format, frame
rate, and frame size. As you work, you may want to review or change some of these
settings.
General
You can view several of Premiere’s General settings here, but you can’t change
most of them after you create a project (Premiere grays them out); examples
include frame size, pixel aspect ratio, and fields. You can edit some other settings
even after you create a project, such as the project’s “title safe” margins.
Capture
Choose the type of file formats Premiere can import for this project, such DV,
HDV, or WDM clips.
Video Rendering
You can view rendering file formats and compressors (codecs), but you may not be
able to make changes.
Tip: When you select one of the Project Settings, such as General or Capture, a window opens that holds
all the project’s settings. Click the list on the left side to choose an option. The Preferences settings (dis-
cussed next) work the same way.
Preferences
Premiere gives you more than a dozen preference panels you can use to make the
program work the way you want it to. You don’t have to make any changes here.
In fact, you may want to leave them alone until you learn your way around the
program.

406
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Edit Menu
General
This panel includes preferences related to the way Premiere plays back your video.
For example, you can specify a default value for transitions and set the timeline to
scroll smoothly or to display one page at a time. One important option here is the
Enable Background Rendering checkbox. Premiere makes temporary copies of your
original media clips, and you actually edit these files as you create your movie. If you
turn on the Rendering checkbox, Premiere does all the calculations necessary to play
back your movie smoothly when it’s not busy with other tasks. But if your computer
struggles to keep up with your edits, turn off this checkbox. When you need to ren-
der a clip to see your movie play back seamlessly, you do it manually, by pressing the
Enter key while you’re working in the timeline or sceneline.
Audio
These preferences control your movie’s audio playback and other audio features as
you edit. For example, if you don’t like the garbled sound when you play clips
backward or at odd speeds, turn off the “Play audio while scrubbing” checkbox.
This section also has settings for SmartMix, Premiere’s tool for automatically bal-
ancing the volume of different sounds in your video.
Audio Hardware
Use this to specify the audio hardware you want Premiere to use. In most cases,
you don’t need to make changes here.
Audio Output Mapping
Use this to specify your computer’s audio hardware. Again, in most cases, you
don’t need to change these settings.
Auto Save
Premiere automatically saves your projects. That way, if disaster strikes, you may
be able to recover a good chunk of your work. These settings let you choose how
frequently Premiere auto-saves your project.
Capture
Capturing video doesn’t always go smoothly. If your computer can’t keep up with
the camcorder or other device feeding it video, it fails to capture all the frames in
the video clip. These gaps are called “dropped frames.” Use these settings to tell
Premiere how many dropped frames you’ll tolerate.

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
407
Edit Menu
Device Control
Device control, where Premiere takes over operation of your camcorder, is described
in detail on page 43. Unless you have a very old or unusual camcorder or video
device, Premiere’s standard settings should work well. If they don’t, you can use
these settings to fine-tune capture options. For a list of specific devices by brand and
model number, click the Options button.
Label Colors
Don’t care for the colors Premiere uses for labels? Choose this preference panel
and go crazy. Click on a despised color and choose a new one from the color
picker.
Label Defaults
Premiere uses specific colors for different labels it applies to your clips. For exam-
ple, video clips use gray labels, while audio clips use green. Here’s where you can
change these colors to match your own sense of style.
Media
Premiere makes temporary copies of your media clips as you edit and stores them
in a place called the Media Cache. After a while, your computer may become filled
up with files you no longer need. Use the settings here to remove these temporary
files by clicking the Clean button. After you do, Premiere makes a new set of tem-
porary files as needed.
Scratch Disks
Premiere works with lots of different files, like your original media clip files and
your temporary editing files. Premiere lists the different file types (captured video,
captured audio, video previews, and so on) here. The Scratch Disks preferences let
you choose where on your computer Premiere stores these different files. If your
PC has a single drive, you don’t need to make changes here. But if you have more
than one internal drive, you may be able to get Premiere to work faster by choos-
ing your fastest drive for items listed in this panel and then putting your project
files on another drive. Don’t use external USB drives for these options, though—
they aren’t fast enough for the job.
Stop Motion Capture
You can create stop-motion special effects as you capture video from a camcorder
or other device (see page 53). Use these preferences to set the initial frame rate and
the onion-skin settings.

408
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Clip Menu
Titler
Choose the letters you want to appear when Premiere displays your font options as
you create movie titles. Unless you change this setting, Premiere displays an upper-
and lowercase “A”.
Web Sharing
Premiere’s Share options include presets for Photoshop.com, YouTube, and
Podbean. Premiere periodically checks for new services (unless you turn off the
“Automatically Check for Services” checkbox), but you can manually check for
them, too, by clicking the Refresh button.
User Interface
When you first run Premiere, the workspace background is a dark gray. This works
well because images pop out from the dark, neutral background. But if gray isn’t
your color, change the brightness settings here—or change Premiere’s colors to
match those your version of Windows uses.
Clip Menu
When you work in Premiere, you’re almost always working with media clips. This
menu is devoted to clip-related tasks like grouping and ungrouping clips and man-
aging clip markers.
Rename (Ctrl+H)
When you add media to your project, the clips display their filenames in the Media
View and Project panel. Often it’s something unhelpful like VID00021.MP4. You
can change that to something that makes more sense, like eagle catches salmon.
This doesn’t change the original clip’s filename, it only changes the name as it
appears in your project.
Insert
Puts the selected clip at the playhead position in the timeline or sceneline. Pre-
miere repositions other clips to accommodate the newcomer.
Overlay
Use this command to replace video in the timeline. First, select a clip in the Project
panel or open it in the Preview window. Then, position the playhead where you
want the new video to appear. Choose the Overlay command and the selected clip
takes the place of the video in the timeline. Alternatively, you can Ctrl-drag a clip
from the Project panel or the Preview window.

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
409
Clip Menu
Enable
Enable is a toggle for clips. Initially, Premiere enables—makes active—all your
clips, and a checkmark appears next to the Enable command. To disable a clip so
that it won’t play back in your movie and won’t be included when you export the
timeline, select a clip and then choose this option so the checkmark disappears.
What’s the advantage of this? It gives you a quick and easy way to preview differ-
ent editing ideas.
Unlink Audio and Video
Most clips you import from your camcorder include audio and video tracks that
play in lockstep. Occasionally, you may want to work with just the audio or just
the video track. Use this command to separate the two. Then, you can use one or
the other.
Group (Ctrl+G)
This command lets you group several clips together so they move around the time-
line as a single clip, which can be a real timesaver. For example, you may have
edited together a sequence of several clips that you wan to reposition. Use this
command to move all the clips at once.
Ungroup (Ctrl+Shift+G)
Use this command to break apart clips you grouped.
Replace Footage
Replaces a clip in your Project panel with a clip that you choose from your com-
puter’s files. This process doesn’t replace footage in your timeline.
Set Clip Marker
Premiere has lots of different markers. You can place markers in the timeline or
within a clip. Clip In and Out points are a type of clip marker. To place markers in
a clip, open the clip in Premiere’s Preview monitor and then choose one of these
options.
In
When you view a clip in the Preview monitor, you can set In and Out points.
Then, when you drag the clip from the Preview monitor to the timeline or scene-
line, Premiere adds only the frames between the In and Out points to your movie.
This command sets the In point in a clip, the beginning of a scene you want to use
in your movie.

410
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Clip Menu
Out
This command sets a clip’s Out point.
Video In
You can set a clip’s video and audio In and Out points separately. This command
sets the Video In point.
Video Out
This command sets the Video Out point.
Audio In
This command sets the Audio In point.
Audio Out
This command sets the Audio Out point.
Unnumbered
Inserts an unnumbered marker in the clip at the playhead’s position. You can
insert markers in a clip for any reason. You may want to mark the place where the
Titanic sinks or Leonardo DiCaprio makes his entrance, for example.
Next Available Numbered
Inserts a numbered marker at the playhead using the next unused number.
Other Numbered
Inserts a numbered marker at the playhead. You get to choose the number.
Go to Clip Marker
Use these options to navigate to specific markers in your clip. Your options are:
• Next (Ctrl+Shift+right arrow key)
• Previous (Ctrl+Shift+left arrow key)
• In
• Out
• Video In
• Video Out
• Audio In
• Audio Out
• Numbered (Ctrl+Shift+3)

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu

Clip Menu
Clear Clip Marker
You can clear (remove) clip markers one at a time or in bunches.
Current (Ctrl+Shift+0)
Clears the marker at the playhead. The easiest way to position the playhead at a
marker is to use one of the Go to Clip Marker commands.
All Markers (Atl+Shift+0)
Removes all the markers from a clip except for In and Out points.
In and Out
Removes In and Out markers.
In
Removes an In marker.
Out
Removes an Out marker.
Numbered
Removes all numbered markers.
Video Options
There are several clip commands that affect the video clip’s appearance:
Frame Hold
You can pause a single frame in your video clip for the duration of the clip. During
this time, the audio track continues to play. You have three options for choosing
the frame Premiere displays: the clip’s In point, its Out point, or a marker that’s
numbered 0.
Field Options
Video often displays a frame of film by weaving together the even-numbered lines
of the frame’s pixels with the odd-numbered lines. This type of playback is called
“interlaced.” Usually, the playback is so fast that you never notice the interlacing.
However, in freeze frames, slow motion shots, or shots with text (titles) in them,
you may be able to see the interlacing. Experiment with these options to fix the
problem.

412
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Clip Menu
Frame Blend
This option can solve interlacing problems in clips played at less than full speed.
Scale to Frame Size
Resizes a clip to match the frame size of the project.
Audio Options
Premiere gives you two clip commands for audio tracks:
Audio Gain
There are two options in the Audio Gain panel. Click the Normalize button to
automatically boost the gain (volume) where it’s too low and to reduce the gain
where it’s too high. Use the number box to increase or decrease the overall input
volume of the clip. Positive numbers increase the gain, negative numbers reduce it.
Render and Replace
Creates a WAV file using the audio from your clip and any effects you may have
applied to it. Premiere makes sure the WAV file matches Premiere’s technical set-
tings for your project. It makes the file available in your Media View and Project
panel.
Time Stretch (Ctrl+R)
Opens the Time Stretch panel to change the speed of a clip. Speed is represented as
a percentage, with 100 percent representing normal speed. To play your clip in
reverse, turn on the “Reverse Speed” box. For more details on Time Stretch, see
page 220.
Scene Detect
Use this command to have Auto-Analyzer break a long clip into smaller parts. It
looks for dramatic changes in the clip’s images and splits the clip into separate
scenes.
Beat Detect
This command analyzes the rhythm of an audio clip and creates beat markers in
the timeline. You can use those markers to edit your video to the rhythm of the
soundtrack.
Effects Mask
Use the Effect Mask command to apply an effect to only a portion of the video
image.

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
413
Timeline Menu
Apply
Creates a rectangular effects mask in the monitor and adds a duplicate clip in an
upper layer of the timeline. You can change the mask’s size and shape by dragging
the corner handles.
Edit
After you apply an effects mask and work in other parts of the timeline, you can no
longer see the effects mask rectangle. Select the duplicate clip in the upper layer of
the timeline and then choose this command to display the effects mask again.
Once it’s displayed, you can move and resize it.
Remove
Deletes the effects mask and the duplicate clip from the timeline.
Remove Effects
Sure, you can manually remove effects from a clip one by one, but that’s a lot of
work. Use these commands to remove more than one effect at a time. Select a clip
in the timeline and then choose one of the following options from the submenu:
• Audio Effects
• Video Effects
• All Effects
Timeline Menu
This menu lets you control the way the timeline works. The options here affect
things like video rendering, the timeline’s appearance, and the markers.
Render Work Area (the Enter key)
Use this command to render any unrendered clips beneath the work area bar, the
gray bar right below the time scale. You can resize the bar by dragging the handles
at either end. Rendering your work smoothes out video playback.
Delete Rendered Files
With Premiere constantly making temporary media files as you edit, your com-
puter can become pretty cluttered with big files. You may no longer need some of
these files because you’re not using the clips in your timeline. Select this command
to delete all temporary files for the project currently open. Premiere will continue
to render files as they’re needed.

414
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Timeline Menu
Delete Rendered Files for All Projects
Running out of disk space? Use this command to delete all the temporary files Pre-
miere has created for different projects.
Split Clip (Ctrl+K)
Position the playhead where you want to break a clip into two parts and then select
this command or click the scissors button in the monitor.
Smart Trim Mode
The Auto-Analyzer examines your clips and marks parts as good or bad. Use this
option to run the Auto-Analyzer and remove the bad portions of clips from your
timeline.
Smart Trim Options
This command lets you guide the Auto-Analyzer and the Smart Trim tool (which
identifies bad portions of clips) as they work. Perhaps you don’t mind shaky video
or underexposed clips. Use sliders to adjust Smart Trim’s sensitivity regarding clip
quality and interest (or subject matter). In manual mode, Smart Trim simply
marks the bad portions, and you can remove them or not. In Automatic mode,
Smart Trim deletes the bad bits right away.
Zoom In (=)
Zooms in on the timeline so you see fewer frames but have a better view of indi-
vidual clips and frames.
Zoom Out (–)
Zooms out from the timeline so you see more of the clips and frames in your
project, but in less detail.
Tip: You can also use the timeline’s slider to zoom in and out. It’s faster and easier to get exactly the view
you want.
Set Beat Marker
Use this command to place a beat marker at the playhead position. You use beat
markets to edit a video to the rhythm of its soundtrack. If you don’t want to man-
ually set beat markers, you can have Premiere automatically detect beats by clicking
the Audio Tools menu and then choosing Detect Beats.
Go to Beat Marker
This command helps you navigate from one beat marker to the next. The two sub-
menu options are Next and Previous.

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
415
Timeline Menu
Clear Beat Marker
Move the playhead to a beat marker and then choose this command to remove the
marker.
Set Timeline Marker
You use timeline markers to tag a particular point in your movie. The markers stay
at the same point in time even if you resize or rearrange clips in the timeline.
Timeline markers come in two flavors: unnumbered and numbered.
Unnumbered
Inserts an unnumbered marker in the timeline. You can use a dialog box to add
comments and adjust the marker’s settings.
Next Available Numbered
Premiere adds a marker to your timeline and gives it the next available number.
Other Numbered
Premiere adds a marker to your timeline and you can assign a number to it.
Go to Timeline Marker
This command helps you navigate from one timeline marker to the next. The three
submenu options are:
• Next (Ctrl+right arrow key)
• Previous (Ctrl+left arrow key)
• Numbered (Ctrl+3)
Clear Timeline Marker
When your timeline gets overly cluttered, you can remove the markers in a number
of ways:
Timeline Marker at Current Time Indicator (Ctrl+0)
Move the playhead to a timeline marker and then use this command to remove it.
All Markers (Alt+0)
Use this to remove all the markers on a timeline
Numbered
This command removes numbered timeline markers, but leaves the unnumbered
ones.

Disc Menu
Edit Timeline Marker
Use this command to open a window where you can edit a timeline marker’s fea-
tures. For example, you can add comments or create a web link. Some options only
work with certain types of video files.
Snap (S)
Make sure this option is checked if you want clips in the timeline to snap together
end-to-end as you work with them.
Apply Default Transition
If you want to have Premiere apply a transition to every cut in the timeline, use
this command. How do you choose a default transition? Go to Window ➝Transi-
tions to view all your options. Right-click a transition and then choose “Set
Selected as Default Transition” from the shortcut menu.
Apply Default Transition Along CTI
Use the Page Up and Page Down keys to position the playhead at a cut between two
clips. Then use this command to apply the default transition. Using the submenu,
you can choose between an audio or video transition. CTI stands for Current Time
Indicator, which this book refers to as the playhead.
Add Tracks
Most of the time, Premiere adds tracks before you need them. But you can use this
command to add tracks manually or to add several tracks at once.
Delete Empty Tracks
Empty tracks don’t have any effect on your project (they don’t even increase the
size of the project file much). But they get in the way as you edit. You can use this
command to tidy up and remove any unused tracks in your project.
Disc Menu
This menu is devoted to saving your movie to a DVD or Blu-ray disc. Most of the
commands here have to do with disc menus and the markers you place in the
timeline to create menus. If you need more details, there’s an entire chapter about
creating DVD and Blu-ray discs (page 337).
Change to Auto-Play
DVD and Blu-ray discs without menus are called Auto-Play discs because they
start playing as soon as you pop them in a player. Use this command to remove all
the menu markers from your project—making it an Auto-Play project.

Generate Menu Marker
Use this command to automatically add scene menu markers to the timeline based
on the options you choose (at the beginning of every clip or every x minutes).
When you copy your movie to a DVD or Blu-ray disc, Premiere uses these mark-
ers to create menus.
Set Menu Marker
Use this command to manually place a menu marker at the playhead’s position.

This option removes all the menu markers from your project.
Title Menu
You use titles to add text to your videos. Premiere comes with templates that add
predesigned titles to your projects, or you can create your own. You can format
and edit the title text just as you would in a word processor. Some of the different
title styles include a main title (used at the beginning of a movie to display its
name), credits, and lower third (used as a label to identify people and places). If
you need more details on titles, check out Chapter 9.
New Title
Use this command to add new generic titles to a movie. You can choose from three
different types of titles:
• Default Still. Static text that doesn’t move.
• Default Roll. Text that moves vertically off the screen, often used in closing
credits.

418
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Title Menu
• Default Crawl. A band of text that moves horizontally across the screen. This is
a favorite of cable news channels.
After you create a new title with this command, you can reposition it on the
screen.
Font
Use this option to choose the typeface (font) for your titles. A submenu lists all the
fonts installed on your computer.
Size
Choose a font size. Submenu options list appropriately large fonts, but you can
choose the Other option and enter any size you want.
Type Alignment
Choose to align text to the left, right, or center.
Orientation
You can orient text horizontally or vertically.
Word Wrap
When you apply this command to your titles, if it’s too long to fit on a single line,
Premiere moves the excess to the next line.
Roll/Crawl Options
This command opens the Roll/Crawl Options panel, where you control how text
and titles move on your screen. For example, you can make text that crawls hori-
zontally move to the left or to the right. Or you can add extra blank space at the
beginning or end of credits.
Image
When you create custom titles, you may want to add clip art or photos to dress
them up. Use these commands to add and format those images:
Add Image
Use this command to add an image as an independent graphic that you can reposition
on-screen. A window opens so you can find graphic files stored on your computer.
Insert Image into Text
Use this option to place an image in your text. The image’s position is linked to its
place in the text.

Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
The “pre” Menu
Online Support
This option takes you to Adobe’s website, which includes user forums and other
online support tools.
About Adobe Premiere Elements
Opens the panel that lists your program’s version number, legal notices, and the
names of the people who developed the program.
Registration
If you didn’t register your copy of Premiere when you first installed it, choose this
option to do so.
Deactivate
Premiere’s license lets you install the program on two computers. The activation
process makes sure you don’t exceed that number. (You activate the program
when you first install and use Premiere.) If you upgrade to a new computer, use
this command to deactivate Premiere on the old computer so you can install a
legal copy on your new one.
Updates
This option runs the Adobe Updater, which checks Adobe’s website to see if any of
your Adobe products need to be updated. If so, this tool walks you through the
process.
The “pre” Menu
At first, you might not recognize the purple “pre” icon in the upper-left corner of
Premiere’s screen as a menu, but it is. It offers basic controls for the Premiere
workspace, commands like Minimize and Maximize that you’d find in any Win-
dows programs.
A program window like the Premiere Elements workspace has different “states.”
For example, you can maximize the window so that it fills your entire screen, or
you can minimize it so that it covers only part of the screen, leaving room for you
to see other windows. The commands described below control these different win-
dow states.
Restore
When you minimize Premiere’s window using the Minimize command described
below, Premiere’s screen closes and Windows creates a Premiere program icon in
the Taskbar (the strip at the bottom of your screen). To get Premiere’s screen back,
right-click that icon and then click Restore.

Appendix C: Premiere Elements 8 Menu by Menu
425
The “pre” Menu
Move
You can’t use the Move command if you have Premiere’s display set to Maximize,
otherwise you can drag Premiere’s top bar to put the window in a new spot. Or if
you prefer, you can right-click the Premiere icon in the Taskbar, select Move from
the drop-down menu, and use the arrow keys to move the window.
Size
Just as with the Move command, you can’t resize a maximized window. But when
the Premiere window covers only part of the screen, you can drag any edge to
resize it. Or you can right-click the Premiere icon in the Taskbar, select Size from
the drop-down menu, and then use the arrow keys to change window’s shape and
size.
Minimize
Hides an open window. Windows deselects Premiere’s icon in the Taskbar.
Maximize
This command makes the Premiere window fill the entire screen.
Close (Alt+4)
This closes the Premiere window and exits the program.

Elements Organizer
Menu by Menu
Adobe’s Elements Organizer program is a standalone application that both Photo-
shop Elements (Adobe’s editing program for still images) and Premiere Elements
use. You install it automatically whenever you install either program.
The Organizer began life as an organizing and editing program for still photog-
raphers, so many of the commands relate only to still photos. This appendix lists
those commands as “For photos” and only covers them briefly. If you need more
details, check out Photoshop Elements 8 for Windows: The Missing Manual by
Barbara Brundage.
Note: For a menu-by-menu description of Premiere Elements, see Appendix C.
File Menu
As with most programs, you use the File menu to manage documents as a whole.
In the case of the Organizer, those documents may be photos, videos, or the Orga-
nizer catalog.
Get Photos and Videos
Use this command to add media (videos, audio, stills) to the Organizer catalog.
From Camera or Card Reader
Imports stills from a camera or card reader.

428
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
File Menu
From Scanner
Starts your scanner software (a separate program) and imports images you scan.
From Files and Folders
Use this command to import video and audio files from your computer into the
Organizer catalog.
By Searching
Searches your hard drive(s) for media files; it looks for common media-file exten-
sions, like AVI for video and MP3 for audio.
This command simply looks for media file types, you can’t limit its scope by pro-
viding part of a filename, although you can limit the search using a couple of check
boxes:
• Exclude System and Program Folders. This option tells the Organizer not to
search folders that are unlikely to contain media files. If you leave this box
unchecked, the search turns up media files—like logos and clip art—that are
part of programs you install.
• Exclude Files Smaller Than. Sets the minimum size for files the search reports.
After the search, the Organizer displays a list of the folders that contain media. You
can select and import the contents of entire folders.
New
This command lets you create video projects and, if you have Photoshop Ele-
ments, still photos.
Photoshop Elements Image File
Starts the Photoshop Elements program and creates an empty Photoshop (.psd) file.
Premiere Elements Video Project
Starts the Premiere Elements program and creates an empty Premiere Elements
(.prel) project.
Image from Clipboard
The behavior of this command varies depending on what type of file the Orga-
nizer has in its Clipboard (temporary memory). For example, if you select a still
image and click the Copy command (Edit ➝Copy), when you use the “Image from
Clipboard command”, the Photoshop Elements Editor opens and creates a new
document using that image. If you use this command after you select a video clip
and use the Copy command, Premiere Elements opens instead.

File Menu
Photomerge Group Shot
For still photos. You can put people from different photos into a single image.
Zelig yourself!
Photomerge Faces
For still photos. You can combine different facial parts into a single face. Identikits
anyone?
Photomerge Scene Cleaner
For still photos. Lets you remove unwanted relatives from family photos.
Photomerge Panorama
For still photos. Opens the Photoshop Elements Editor, where you can stitch sev-
eral photos together into a single image.
Photomerge Exposure
For still photos. Opens the Photoshop Elements Editor, where you can make expo-
sure adjustments by averaging the exposure of two different images.
Open Recently Edited File in Editor
Works as advertised to help you launch photos and video projects you recently
worked on. This option presents two lists, one for Premiere Elements and one for
Photoshop Elements.
Catalog
Elements Organizer keeps track of different media files. The file where the Orga-
nizer stores this information is called the catalog. This command opens the Cata-
log Manager. You may not need to use the commands here often, but they let you
rename, move (to a new folder), and remove catalogs. If the Organizer is extremely
sluggish or behaving oddly, try the Optimize or Repair buttons.
Usually, you want to have a single catalog to keep track of all your media, but you
may want to have more than one. Perhaps you’d like to keep your personal media
separate from your business media, for example. In that case, use this command to
open the Catalog Manager, where you can work with multiple catalogs.
Burn data CD/DVD
Use this command to create copies of your media files. When you use this com-
mand with video files, you’re not creating a DVD that plays in your home DVD
player. Instead, you’re making copies of your raw video clips as an archive.

430
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
File Menu
Copy/Move to Removable Disk
If you want to move media clips to different folders or drives on your computer,
use this command. The purpose of the Organizer is to keep track of your media. If,
after you import a video clip or photo using the Organizer, you use Windows
Explorer to move the file, the Organizer won’t know where to find it.
Backup Catalog to CD, DVD or Hard Drive
Use this command to make a backup copy of your media files. It’s always good to
have more than one copy of important or irreplaceable files, and photos and
videos often fit that description.
Restore Catalog from CD, DVD or Hard Drive
Use this command to copy (or restore) your backed-up files to your computer and
catalog.
Duplicate
Select a photo or media clip and then choose this command to create a copy of it. You
see two thumbnails of the clip in the Organizer and two copies on your computer.
Reconnect
If you rename folders or move files using other programs, the Organizer loses track
of them. Use these commands to find missing files and reconnect them to the
Organizer catalog.
Missing File
If the Organizer can’t find a file you previously added to its catalog, you see a
thumbnail image with a question mark. Select the thumbnail and then choose this
command to find the missing file.
All Missing Files
Use this command to find and reconnect all the media in the catalog that’s unac-
counted for.
Watch Folders
The Organizer can “watch” folders on your computer and automatically add any
media you put there to its catalog. Select this menu item to tell the program which
folders you want it to keep tabs on.

Appendix D: Elements Organizer Menu by Menu
431
Edit Menu
Rename
Use this command to rename your media. If you use other programs, such as Win-
dows Explorer, to rename your photos or video files after you’ve added them to
the Organizer’s catalog, the Organizer will lose track of them.
Write Keyword Tag and Properties Info to Photo
For still photos. This command lets you store keywords tags in a photo file as part
of its metadata. (Metadata is info about a file that’s stored with that file.)
Move
Use this command to, well, move your media. If you use other programs, such as
Windows Explorer, to move your photos or video files after you’ve added them to
the Organizer’s catalog, the Organizer will lose track of them.
Export As New File(s)
Select the media files you want to export, and then select this command. A win-
dow opens where you can choose a location for the duplicate files. When you work
with photos, you can choose new file formats, too. For example, you can export a
Photoshop (.psd) file as a JPEG (.jpg).
Print
Use this option to print photos or the first frame of your videos.
Exit
Closes the catalog and then closes the Organizer itself. (Closing the Organizer
doesn’t close Premiere Elements.)
Edit Menu
The Edit menu’s items help you work on individual photos and media clips.
Undo
This command undoes the last command you applied. So it can come to the res-
cue if you accidentally delete a clip or you commit an editing faux pas. Remember
Undo for those moments when you smack your forehead and say “Oh no! Why’d I
do that?” The Organizer keeps track of your actions sequentially, so you can use
Undo multiple times to backtrack through your recent actions.

432
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual
Edit Menu
Redo
This command lets you undo an Undo. If you undo an action or a command and
then decide that you preferred it before the Undo, use Redo to get back to square
one. You can use multiple Undos and Redos to move back and forth through your
recent Organizer activities.
Copy
Copies the selected media clip or other item (photo, MP3, sound file, and so on)
and places the copy on the Clipboard (the original stays where it is).
Select All
Selects all the items in the Organizer’s catalog.
Deselect
Deselects any items you’ve selected.
Delete from Catalog
Remove an item from the Organizer’s catalog. (This doesn’t delete the file from
your computer.)
Rotate 90 Degrees Left
For still photos. Rotates the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
Rotate 90 Degrees Right
For still photos. Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.
Auto Smart Fix
For still photos. Applies several of Photoshop Elements’ Smart Fix options to
improve the photo.
Auto Red Eye Fix
For still photos. Reduces red eye caused by camera flash.
Edit with Photoshop Elements
For still photos. Opens a still image in Photoshop Elements.
Edit with Premiere Elements
Opens a movie clip in Premiere Elements. Adds the clip to the end of the timeline.

Appendix D: Elements Organizer Menu by Menu
433
Edit Menu
Edit with Photoshop
For still photos. Opens a still image in Photoshop.
Adjust Date and Time
The date and time the Organizer displays under catalog thumbnails don’t have to
match the file’s Date Created or Date Modified settings. Use this command when
you want to reset an item’s displayed date and time. The panel that appears gives
your three options:
• Change to a specified date and time.
• Change to match the file’s date and time.
• Shift by a set number of hours (time zone adjust).
Add Caption
Use this command to add a caption to photos or media clips. You can then use this
text to search for specific items.
Update Thumbnail
Updates the thumbnail for the selected photo or media clip. If you need to recon-
nect the file to the Organizer (see the Reconnect command on page 430), a search
panel opens and automatically searches for the original file.
Set as Desktop Wallpaper
For still photos. Changes your Windows desktop settings to use the selected photo
as your desktop’s background.
Ratings
You can easily give your photos and clips a rating of from 1 to 5 stars, a great way
to separate good media from so-so media. Once you apply a rating, you can filter
the clips in the catalog by their rating. For more details, see page 109.
Visibility
Use these commands to show and hide media in the catalog. They’re helpful when
you want to reduce clutter.
Mark as Hidden/Mark as Visible
Toggles whether the selected file is hidden or visible.
Show All Files
Displays all your files, even those marked as hidden.

434
Premiere Elements 8: The Missing Manual

Yahoo! Maps.
Remove from Map
For still photos. Breaks the link between a photo and a geographical location.
Show on Map
For still photos. Displays a photo location on a Yahoo! Map.
Stack
For still photos. Used to group still photos together. Only the top photo in a stack
is visible unless you expand the stack. Similar to video scenes, described below.
Version Set
For still photos. Used to keep track of different versions of an edited image.
Video Scene
Select this menu item and Premiere’s Auto-Analyzer breaks the selected video clip
into scenes based on changes in the image. A single clip that has several scenes dis-
plays a lighter-colored frame than continuous clips. Use this command or click the
button on the right side of the thumbnail’s frame to expand and collapse clips with
scenes.
Run Auto-Analyzer
Starts the Auto-Analyzer, which examines the selected media. When it’s done, it
applies Smart Tags to the clips and may divide the clip into scenes. Smart Tags
describe many clip characteristics, including overall quality, audio quality, expo-
sure, contrast, focus, motion, shakiness, faces, and number of objects.
Color Settings
For still photos. Used to manage the color settings for photos, according to profes-
sional standards. You can choose to optimize color for computer screens or printing.
Contact Book
If you frequently send photos or clips to the same people, you can create a contact
book within the Organizer to stores names, email addresses, and physical addresses.
You can import vCards (electronic business cards) into the contact book.

Find Menu
Preferences
Use this commands to adjust the way the Organizer works. For example, if you
only use Premiere Elements and not Photoshop Elements, go to Edit ➝Prefer-
ences ➝Editing and deselect “Show Photoshop Elements Options”. You can also
use the preferences to control how the Auto-Analyzer behaves. You can choose
whether to have Auto-Analyzer automatically analyze everything in your catalog
and which features it identifies. If you want, you can even have the Auto-Analyzer
start working when you first turn on your computer, even when you haven’t
started Premiere Elements.
Find Menu
The commands on the Find menu help you hunt down needles in haystacks. As
time goes on, your catalog gets bigger and bigger, so you need these tools to work
quickly and efficiently. In general, the Find tools act as filters or they sort items in
the catalog so you can zero in on the media you need.
Set Date Range
Opens the Set Date Range dialog box, where you can specify a Start Date and End
Date so the Organizer only displays media within that range.
Clear Date Range
Removes the Date Range filter and displays all the media in your catalog.
By Caption or Note
Use this command to search for media by the text in your captions or notes.
Note: After you use one of the Find commands, click the Show All button below the menu bar to see
your entire catalog again.
By Filename
Use this command to search for media by the text in their filenames. You don’t
have to use a complete filename—just a few characters does the trick.
All Version Sets
For still photos. Used to display all of an image’s version sets (see the Version Set
command on page 434).
All Stacks
For still photos. Used to display all your photo stacks (see the Stack command on
page 434).

By History
The Organizer keeps track of what you do with your media. So if you remember
emailing a clip to someone, you can go to By History ➝“E-mailed to” to hunt
down the name of the file you sent. Here are the By History commands:
• Imported on
• E-mailed to
• Printed on
• Exported on
• Ordered Online
• Shared Online
• Used in Projects
By Media Type
Use this command to display a particular type of media. For example, you can
view all your audio clips. The options are:
• Photos
• Video
• Audio
• Projects
• PDF
• Items with Audio Captions
By Details (Metadata)
This command lets you search the info stored with video or still files (see “Write
Keyword Tag and Properties Info to Photo” on page 431). In general, still photos
store a much richer set of information. However, you can search video files for cer-
tain details, like displaying all the video clips that use a frame rate greater than 15fps.
For still photos: Certain image file formats can store text info along with the image.
That text is called metadata, and it may include details about the subject in the
photo or the camera settings used to capture the image. Use this command to hunt
down photos based on their metadata.
Items with Unknown Date or Time
Displays items that don’t have a date and timestamp.

Timeline
Shows and hides a timeline at the top of the Organizer window. Not to be con-
fused with the timeline in Premiere Elements, the Organizer’s timeline displays a
bar graph representing your media by the date displayed in the Organizer. Usually
this date is the same as the date you imported or last changed the file, but you can
change it using the Edit ➝“Adjust Date and Time” command (page 433). Click on
a bar to display the related photos and media clips.
Properties
Opens the Properties panel for selected media. This panel is helpful when you want
to find a file’s location or determine its size. The Properties panel has four tabs:
• General. Includes the filename, size, folder location, and date stamp.
• Metadata. For videos, this displays the date the file was created and modified, as
well as the document type and details such as the frame rate. For photos, this
displays the metadata saved with the image.
• Keyword Tags. Displays the keyword tags applied to the selected media.
• History. Displays details such as when you imported, emailed, or shared a
media clip.

which you find in any Windows programs.

Appendix D: Elements Organizer Menu by Menu

The Organizer
Window Menu
A program window like the Organizer workspace has different “states.” For exam-
ple, you can maximize the window so that it fills your entire screen, or you can
minimize it so that it covers only part of the screen, leaving room for you to see
other windows. The commands described below control these different window
states.
Restore
When you minimize the Organizer window using the Minimize command
described below, Windows closes the Organizer’s screen and adds an Organizer
icon to Taskbar (the strip at the bottom of your screen). To get the Organizer’s
screen back, right-click that icon and then click Restore.
Move
You can’t use the Move command if you maximize the Organizer’s window, but
when it covers only part of the screen, you can drag the top bar to put the window
in a new spot. Or right-click the Organizer icon in the Taskbar, select Move from
the drop-down menu, and use arrow keys to move the window.
Size
Just as with the Move command, you can’t resize a maximized window. But when
the Organizer window covers only part of your screen, you can drag any edge to
resize it. Or if you prefer, you can right-click the Organizer’s icon in the Taskbar,
select Size from the drop-down menu, and then use the arrow keys to change the

Minimize
Hides an open window. Windows deselects the Organizer’s icon in the Taskbar.
Maximize
This command makes the Organizer window fill your whole screen.
Close (Alt+4)
This closes the Organizer window and exits the program.
Tip: If you’re working with dual monitors and have trouble getting the Elements Organizer to show itself,
try this: Right-click the Organizer icon in the Windows task bar and choose Minimize. Then right-click it
and choose Maximize. If you still don’t see the Organizer, right-click it one more time in the Task Bar and
choose Maximize a second time. It doesn’t seem quite right, but it works with most dual monitor setups.
