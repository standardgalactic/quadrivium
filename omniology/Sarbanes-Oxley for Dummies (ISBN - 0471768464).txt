Introduction
W
elcome to Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies. This book takes you on a tour
of post-Enron corporate America. Whether you’re a CEO, governance
officer, CPA, manager, entrepreneur, file clerk, or cleric, this book is for you.
It’s designed to tell you where you fit into the grand scheme of corporate
compliance and why you’re being asked to do what you do by your board of
directors, banker, customers, and clients.
Having the big picture straight in your mind helps ensure that you won’t lose
track of the minutiae and details that accompany the sweeping piece of legis-
lation that is Sarbanes-Oxley, whether you’re gearing up for initial compliance
or attempting to streamline in subsequent years. If you’re part of a private
company or not-for-profit, a special congratulations to you. You know that
Sarbanes-Oxley is here to stay and is becoming the gold standard for fair, 
ethical, and efficient business practices.
About This Book
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, as it’s affectionately called in the world of
corporate governance, is a responsive piece of legislation. Like the securities
laws passed in the 1930s, SOX was passed in response to a real crisis and
genuine public outrage. It sailed through Congress on a wave of bipartisan
support surprisingly free of lobbying and loophole legislating. Instead,
Congress left the details to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
and the newly created Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB). This book walks you through SOX’s rather piecemeal rules and pro-
nouncements and gives you a sense of how to anticipate future trends and
traps in this area of the law.
The goal of Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies is to give you a helicopter view of
the regulatory terrain while helping you focus a beam on the key details of
the legislation. This book is intended to give you a sophisticated understand-
ing of the purpose and structure of the legislation as it affects many disciplines
and areas of the law. Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies will empower you with the
level of insight you need for practical, cost-effective decision making.

This book will assist you in
 Understanding why SOX was passed: Looking at the kind of conduct
SOX was intended to combat can help you create meaningful standards
for the company with which you work or are affiliated.
 Instituting cost-effective compliance with SOX: This book’s practical
view of the legislation can keep you from becoming bogged down in reg-
ulatory details and allowing lawyers and accountants to go off on expen-
sive tangents that have little to do with the essence of SOX.
 Finding answers on specific SOX issues: This book explains how and
where to find SEC rules and pronouncements critical to implementation
of SOX and translates those rules into plain English.
 Avoiding lawsuits and regulatory actions: This book, although not
intended as a substitute for a good securities lawyer or a CPA, takes a
hard look at who gets sued under SOX and how you can avoid having
your company or yourself added to the list of litigants.
 Anticipating future rules and trends: SEC rules and PCAOB pronounce-
ments under SOX continue to be issued with regularity. But with a com-
prehensive understanding of what the law is designed to do, you’ll be
less surprised by what’s ultimately issued.
What I Assume About You
In writing this book, I had to make a few assumptions about who my readers
would be and what kind of information they’d be looking for. First of all, I
assume you want to understand the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a way you can’t
achieve by suffering through the 80-some pages of the statute and 1,000 or so
pages of related congressional hearings. You want to make sure you have a
handle on the important aspects of the legislation, how it affects you and
your company, and how companies can comply most cost-effectively.
Secondly, if you’re a service provider such as a lawyer or CPA, I assume you’re
looking for insight into the following tasks — insights you would glean from
the legal and accounting professionals involved in writing this book (whose
credentials and accomplishments are listed on the acknowledgments page):
 Recognizing and creating a legally effective, fully compliant corporate
governance framework
 Determining what aspects of SOX apply to your company or should be
voluntarily adopted by your company (whether it’s publicly traded, pri-
vately held, or not-for-profit)
2
Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies 

 Managing and streamlining Section 404 compliance, as well as seizing
opportunities and benefiting from information resulting from the
unprecedented testing and documentation of business processes all
across the United States
 Interpreting media accounts, court cases, and economic projections
involving SOX
Conventions Used in This Book
It’s unfortunate, but understanding SOX means that you’re going to run into
lots of legal jargon and accounting minutiae. To give you a jump start, I define
some legal and accounting terms in this book and use italics to make such
terms stand out a bit.
Also, I occasionally wander off-topic to discuss something historical, techni-
cal, or interesting (or, at least, interesting to me!). In these instances, I set the
discussions apart by placing them in sidebars, which are the gray boxes you’ll
see from time to time throughout the book. Because the text in sidebars is
nonessential, feel free to skip it if it doesn’t interest you.
How This Book Is Organized
Sarbanes-Oxley is an extremely broad piece of legislation, spanning legal,
accounting, and information technology disciplines. The index and table of
contents will help you find your way. The chapters in this book treat each
topic independently without assuming you’ve read previous chapters (as a
textbook might), so you can use them as references and jump around to find
what you need. Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies is divided into six parts, which I
explain in the following sections.
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX
This part of the book starts at the beginning, explaining why SOX was passed
and taking you on a tabloid tour of the corporate scandals — Enron,
WorldCom, Adelphi, Global Crossing, and more — that inspired it. These
chapters shock you with tales of greed and manipulation and then walk you
section-by-section through the legislation, explaining what each provision is
intended to accomplish.
3
Introduction

Part II: SOX in the City: 
Meeting New Standards
The chapters in this part spell out who’s affected by which provisions. You
find out why the accounting profession is no longer self-regulating and are
introduced to the new audit ambience. You also get a good look at what SOX
means for management, including what’s expected of boards and the commit-
tees formed under their direction.
Part III: Surviving Section 404
SOX Section 404 is a big enough deal to warrant its own part in this book.
These chapters take you by the hand and guide you through the dreaded
Section 404 audit process. They tell you how to manage a Section 404 project
and when and how to cut compliance costs without cutting corners.
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies
This part of Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies is all about software. It explains how
software can help you comply with SOX and what to look for when investing
in information technology to carry out SOX objectives. These chapters also
sample some of the more cost-effective products on the market and suggest
particularly useful systems for small to mid-size companies.
Part V: To SOX-finity and Beyond
This part looks at the future of SOX and corporate governance. These chap-
ters take you into the courtroom to see who’s getting sued under SOX and
what the outcomes are. This part also looks at what SOX means for out-
sourced services and service providers and explains when special SAS 70
reports are required (as well as when they aren’t).
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part provide the skinny on important subjects such as
what every audit committee absolutely must undertake, how to avoid getting
sued under SOX, and even how to save money with SOX. In essence, this part
of the book is about taking control and proceeding confidently under SOX.

Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies 

Part VII: Appendixes
The appendixes in the book contain useful reference materials and forms you
can actually put to use in your company. It also contains a teeny-tiny version
of the entire Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (Don’t worry, more user-friendly, searchable
versions of SOX are located online at www.findlaw.com and on the
Securities and Exchange Web site at www.sec.gov.)
Icons Used In This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to flag parts of text that
stand out from the rest for one reason or another. Here’s what the icons in
this book mean:
Time is money. When you see this icon, your attention’s being directed to a
compliance shortcut or timesaving tip.
This icon signals the type of advice you may get in a lawyer’s office if your
company were paying the exorbitant going rates. Of course, the information
highlighted by this icon is no substitute for sound legal advice from your own
company attorney, who actually knows the facts of your individual situation.
This icon indicates you’re getting the kind of tip your audit or CPA firm might
dispense. Of course, you should actually consult a real accounting profes-
sional before acting on anything that follows this icon.
This is a heads-up warning to help you avoid compliance mistakes, legal
traps, and audit imbroglios.
This icon flags particularly noteworthy information — stuff you shouldn’t
forget.
Where to Go from Here
Because I wrote each chapter of this book as a stand-alone treatment of the
topic covered, you can start with Chapter 1 and read the whole book, or you
can skip around and brush up only on the topics that interest you at the
5
Introduction

moment. If you’re new to SOX, I recommend you start with Part I. If you’re hip
to securities law in general and SOX in particular, skip ahead to the parts in
the book that address your particular needs or concerns.

Part I
The Scene Before
and After SOX

In this part . . .
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, didn’t pop up out of
nowhere. Rather, its passage is rooted in some steamy
corporate scandals. This part examines how Congress
responded to events surrounding Enron, Tyco, WorldCom,
Gobal, TelLink, and Adelphia in a bipartisan whirlwind.
This part also looks at how this far-reaching legislation
affects existing securities legislation, what it says, what it
certainly doesn’t say, and how it has spawned some
mighty media myths.

Chapter 1
The SOX Saga
In This Chapter
 Riding the wave of political support for SOX
 Looking at the loopholes SOX closed
 Surveying SOX’s impact
 Debunking some common media myths about SOX
I
n response to a loss of confidence among American investors reminiscent
of the Great Depression, President George W. Bush signed the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act into law on July 30, 2002. SOX, as the law was quickly dubbed, is
intended to ensure the reliability of publicly reported financial information
and bolster confidence in U.S. capital markets. SOX contains expansive duties
and penalties for corporate boards, executives, directors, auditors, attor-
neys, and securities analysts.
Although most of SOX’s provisions are mandatory only for public companies
that file a Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
many private and nonprofit companies are facing market pressures to con-
form to the SOX standards. Privately held companies that fail to reasonably
adopt SOX-type governance and internal control structures may face increased
difficulty in raising capital, higher insurance premiums, greater civil liability,
and a loss of status among potential customers, investors, and donors.
In this chapter, I take a look at the political impetus for SOX and summarize
some key provisions of the SOX statute in plain English. I also dispel a few
common SOX myths.
The Politics of SOX
SOX passed through both houses of Congress on a wave of bipartisan politi-
cal support not unlike that which accompanied the passage of the U.S. Patriot
Act after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Public shock greased the wheels of the
political process. Congress needed to respond decisively to the Enron media
fallout, a lagging stock market, and looming reelections (see Chapter 2 for

details). SOX passed in the Senate 99–0 and cleared the House with only three
dissenting votes.
Because political support for SOX was overwhelming, the legislation was not
thoroughly debated. Thus, many SOX provisions weren’t painstakingly
vetted and have since been questioned, delayed, or slated for modification.  
For the past 70 years, U.S. securities laws have required regular reporting of
results of a company’s financial status and operations. SOX now focuses on
the accuracy of what’s reported and the reliability of the information-gathering
processes. After SOX, companies must implement internal controls and
processes that ensure the accuracy of reported results.
Prior to SOX, the Securities Act of 1933 was the dominant regulatory mecha-
nism. The 1933 Act requires that investors receive relevant financial informa-
tion on securities being offered for public sale, and it prohibits deceit,
misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities.
The SEC enforces the 1933 Act requiring corporations to register stock and
securities they offer to the public. The registration forms contain financial
statements and other disclosures to enable investors to make informed judg-
ments in purchasing securities. (For more about the securities registration
process, flip to Chapter 3.) The SEC requires that the information companies
provide be accurate and certified by independent accountants.
SEC registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after
they’re filed with the SEC. Statements filed by U.S. domestic companies are
available on the EDGAR database accessible at www.sec.gov.
A loophole under prior law
SOX provides that publicly traded corporations of all sizes must meet its
requirements. However, not all securities offerings must be registered with
the SEC. Some exemptions from the registration requirement include:
 Private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions
 Offerings of limited size
 Intrastate offerings
 Securities of municipal, state, and federal governments
The SEC exempts these small offerings to help smaller companies acquire
capital more easily by lowering the cost of offering securities to the public.
In contrast, SOX provides that publicly traded corporations of all sizes must
meet certain specific requirements depending on the size of the corporation.
10
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

11
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga
Not everyone’s a SOX fan
Only three Congressmen opposed the 2002 pas-
sage of SOX: GOP Representatives Ron Paul of
Texas, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Mac Collins of
Georgia. Congressman Flake observed:
Obviously there are businesses that were
acting in a fraudulent manner. We still have
that today, and there are laws on the books
that thankfully are being used more aggres-
sively today to get at these businesses. But
when we react so quickly, sometimes with-
out the best knowledge of how to do this,
without some of these investigations taking
their course, without these enforcement
agencies giving us full recommendations,
then we have unintended consequences.
In the years after SOX, many businesses and
politicians are echoing the sentiments of
Congressman Flake. The greatest criticism has
been the financial burden imposed on small
companies. The SEC received so many com-
plaints about the disproportionately high costs
of compliance for smaller public companies that
it convened an Advisory Committee on Smaller
Public Companies to investigate them. In
response, the SEC has voted twice to extend the
compliance deadline for Section 404 smaller
public companies, called non-accelerated
filers, primarily because it has acknowledged
that the costs of compliance for smaller com-
panies greatly exceeded estimates. (Section
404 is discussed in Chapter 11.)
The SEC extended the deadline for small-cap
companies by one year, voting in March 2005 to
push the compliance date to July 2006. When
this extension failed to stop the grumbling about
costs and confusion about compliance, the SEC
decided in September 2005 that small compa-
nies wouldn’t be required to comply with the
Section 404 requirements until their first fiscal
year ending on or after July 15, 2007.
In addition to the burden on small business, SOX
is criticized for the sheer confusion it has cre-
ated. SOX requires accounting firms and com-
panies to simultaneously monitor several
evolving sets of interpretive standards from the
SEC and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB). Early attempts to
implement SOX have been accompanied by
more resignations within regulatory agencies
than shake-ups in corporate boardrooms. (The
PCOAB is on its third chairman in as many
years, as discussed in Chapter 6, and turnover
at the SEC has been equally eventful since
SOX.) most studies have shown that SOX has
impacted the composition and behavior of cor-
porate boards, to date, less than expected.
Regulatory confusion isn’t the only culprit; many
companies have contributed to their own SOX
woes by simply failing to plan properly. The
start-up costs of any initiative are always high-
est in the beginning; however, many companies
simply panicked, hiring teams of expensive con-
sultants and launching overlapping and ill-con-
ceived projects to document their controls
under SOX. This initial “spare-no-expense”
approach may have helped some companies
meet a deadline, but it also established the
framework for new internal bureaucracy.
A final, broader criticism waged against SOX is
its effect on the competitiveness of U.S. busi-
nesses. Many argue that SOX is a major dis-
traction from the core activities of businesses,
making them less viable in a global market-
place. Management must spend more time
jumping through regulatory hoops and less time
innovating. Arguably, SOX also makes it more
difficult and costly for technologically innova-
tive companies to raise capital by selling their
stock on U.S. exchanges because of the
increased regulatory burden. (See Chapter 3 for
an explanation of securities registration
requirements and stock exchanges.)

New ammunition for aggrieved investors
SOX now gives public companies specific directives as to how financial infor-
mation offered to the public must be compiled, yet, as Chapter 16 discusses,
it stops short of giving investors a right to sue companies privately for failing
to meet these standards. Rather, with the exception of SOX Section 306 (deal-
ing with stock trading during pension fund blackout periods), investors must
wait for the SEC and Justice Department to bring actions against companies
for SOX violations. Investors can’t hire their own lawyers to initiate action on
their behalf.
Although there’s no “private right” to sue directly under SOX, shareholders
and litigants are in a much stronger position after SOX than under the old fed-
eral and state statutes. Prior to SOX, federal and state laws didn’t establish
specific standards for corporations in compiling the information they fed to
the public in their financial reports. In the event that investors were damaged
or defrauded, the investors themselves were responsible for persuading
judges the information they had received wasn’t truthful or accurate, without
reference to any specific standards. Aggrieved investors had only an amor-
phous body of analogous facts from prior court cases to try to convince
courts to apply their specific situation. Now plaintiffs may strengthen their
claims and arguments by referencing the standards set forth in SOX.
Corporate America after SOX
SOX goes where the federal government has never gone before. Although fed-
eral regulation of the sale of securities to protect the public is nothing new, SOX
goes beyond simply prohibiting deceptive conduct and misrepresentations — it
actually tells public corporations how they must run themselves, and creates
a new environment for nonpublic companies and nonprofits.
SOX defines specific duties for employees and board members and dictates
the structure of boards of directors. It even tells corporations how they have
to conduct their day-to-day operations to prevent theft and misappropria-
tion, requiring them to maintain adequate internal controls. (I talk more
about internal controls in Chapter 11.) SOX also elbows out state govern-
ments in their traditional roles of governing corporations, making corporate
law in the United States much more federalized.
Who Combats Corruption under SOX?
SOX is a multidisciplinary piece of legislation that regulates several profes-
sions simultaneously. Board members, auditors, attorneys, management,
small business owners, and even rank-and-file employees all have their own
statutorily scripted roles to play.
12
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

The independent audit board
One of the most significant reforms introduced by SOX is the advent of the
independent audit board. SOX requires corporations to have audit commit-
tees made up solely of independent directors. Board members are considered
independent in the sense that they receive no salary or fees from the com-
pany other than for services as directors.
The audit committee is responsible for obtaining information from manage-
ment relevant to the audit and otherwise assisting in the audit process. It’s
viewed as an important part of a company’s internal control because it pro-
vides a company presence entirely independent from management and inter-
faces with the independent auditors (from an outside firm). For more
coverage of the audit committee’s responsibilities, check out Chapter 7.
Ironically, one firm that would have been able to comply with the SOX direc-
tor independence requirements before the law was passed was Enron. Eighty-
six percent of Enron’s board was independent. A former dean of the Stanford
Business School and professor of accounting chaired its audit committee. Yet
when the scandal broke, the professor claimed he didn’t understand the
audit documentation.
SOX presumes that boards made up of independent directors will look out for
shareholders’ interests and ask auditors to more carefully review manage-
ment policies and decisions that can affect profitability. However, in the end,
an independent audit committee isn’t a panacea and doesn’t guarantee objec-
tivity in the audit process. The committee, the board, and the auditors all
must rely on the accuracy of the information they get from management and
on management to recognize, anticipate, and prevent problems.
SOX regulates the membership composition of boards but doesn’t specifi-
cally regulate their behavior.
Evolving auditors
Auditors are the traditional arbiters of accurate information within a com-
pany. They’re the accountants responsible for testing the accounting data
gathered from management and from rank-and-file employees. Auditors may
be either internal employees of a company or independent auditors working
for an outside firm.
Both internal and independent auditors adhere to Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP is a term that refers to the rules estab-
lished by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC, which is the standard-setting body
for publicly traded U.S. companies and the exchanges that list their stock.
13
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga

GAAP contains a number of provisions designed to ensure auditors’ indepen-
dence, objectivity, and professionalism. An auditor must certify that a com-
pany’s financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP and
contain no material irregularities that would adversely affect reported results.
Traditionally, auditors have been viewed as pretty trustworthy people. The
Enron scandal that led to the demise of the nation’s largest independent
auditing firm, Arthur Andersen, changed all that. Congress and the public
were shocked that one of the world’s largest corporations (Enron) could col-
lapse within five months of receiving a clean opinion from its auditors
(Andersen). (I talk more about the Enron and Arthur Andersen stories in
Chapters 2 and 5.)
At the Enron trials, senior managers testified that the auditors never brought
material issues to the managers’ attention. The managers claimed that although
they had ultimate responsibility for what was included in the financial state-
ments with the SEC, they couldn’t know what the auditors didn’t tell them or
failed to bring to their attention. It also came to light that the so-called inde-
pendent auditors weren’t so independent. In addition to providing audit ser-
vices, they provided a myriad of highly lucrative consulting, tax, and other
support services to Enron, which meant that the audit firm had tremendous
financial incentives to stay on good terms with Enron, rather than being vocal
about the company’s accounting flaws.
Enron wasn’t the only scandal that tainted the audit industry. During the
Savings and Loan (S&L) crisis of the 1980s, auditors failed to take into
account the industry’s shift from home loans to riskier real estate ventures
and junk bonds. As a result, many S&Ls went bankrupt just months or even
weeks after getting clean opinions from their auditors.
To resolve problems associated with self-regulation (which had previously
been the norm for the accounting profession), SOX creates the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a regulatory oversight
board. This board is charged with the enormous responsibilities of setting
ethics and conflict of interest standards as well as disciplining accountants
and conducting annual reviews of large accounting firms. (For more on the
PCAOB, turn to Chapter 6.)
Not only has the accounting profession suffered the loss of the right to regu-
late itself, but it can no longer market and compete for business in the same
way. SOX makes it unlawful for a registered audit firm to provide many types
of nonaudit services to its clients that were formally its bread-and-butter. For
example, an audit firm can’t provide bookkeeping, financial information sys-
tems design, appraisal, evaluation, actuarial, or investment services to
clients it audits. (However, audit firms can make up some, if not all, of this
lost income by performing internal control audits under Section 404 of SOX;
see Chapter 12.)
14
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

According to a survey of 32 mid-sized companies by the law firm Foley &
Lardner, accounting, audit, and legal fees also doubled under Sarbanes-Oxley.
The costs of directors’ liability insurance skyrocketed from $329,000 to
$639,000.
Lawyers’ noisy new liability
Incident to its authority to make rules under SOX, the SEC has proposed a con-
troversial noisy withdrawal rule for attorneys. The rule would require a lawyer
who learns of a corporate client’s wrongdoing to alert SEC regulators to the
nature of any ongoing fraud before withdrawing from representation. Attorneys
who are unable to persuade a corporate client to mend its ways would be
required to notify the SEC that they are withdrawing from representation. Not
surprisingly, opponents have argued that the rule violates traditional concepts
of attorney-client privilege. However, the American Bar Association has taken
the position that noisy withdrawal doesn’t violate the privilege.
CEOs and CFOs 
SOX forces chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs)
of corporations to take responsibility and possibly face criminal penalties for
earnings misstatements. They’re required to certify in writing that the infor-
mation appearing in the company’s report is a fair and accurate representa-
tion of the company’s financial status and activity.
Not only do criminal penalties apply if officers and directors misstate finan-
cial information, but these individuals also can be required to give back their
bonuses to compensate the company for the costs of redoing the financial
statements. (For more on the consequences officers and directors face for
misstatements, check out Chapter 2.) Under SOX, each member of manage-
ment is expected to certify that he or she runs a clean ship — no excuses.
Small businesses and nonprofits 
in the headlights
Although SOX was passed to deal with mega-scandals like Enron and WorldCom,
it’s becoming a catastrophe for American small business. As of this writing,
although the wording of the SOX statute technically applies only to publicly
traded corporations, it’s the benchmark against which every privately held
company’s financial and corporate governance practices are measured.
15
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga

Banks and insurance companies report that they now ask small, privately
held companies about their internal controls and audit procedures. Failure 
to answer convincingly can result in more costly credit or higher insurance
premiums.
Nonprofits, which can’t afford a hint of scandal that may ruin their credibility
with donors, are rushing to adopt governance and conflict-of-interest policies
in line with SOX.
Start-ups and new ventures are facing increased hurdles as they attempt to
“go public” by becoming eligible to list their stock on exchanges.
The rank-and-file 
SOX imposes new burdens on rank-and-file employees, often requiring them
to adhere more carefully to company procedures or to complete additional
documentation to carry out new internal control measures. However, SOX
empowers blue-collar and other nonmanagerial employees in other ways:
 Section 301(4) requires publicly traded companies to collect, retain, and
resolve complaints from employees.
 Section 806 specifically protects whistle-blowers who report violations
of law or company policy from suffering retaliation by the company.
New high–paid governance gurus
Nearly every public company has designated specific management or legal
personnel responsible for overseeing corporate governance policies. A 2005
survey posted on Salary.com reported compensation for many top global
ethics and compliance executives to be approaching $750,000.
A Summary of SOX: Taking It 
One Title at a Time
The SOX statute is more or less an outline, with full details coming in the
form of Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) rules for implementation as
well as pronouncements from the newly created Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB). Most of SOX’s provisions currently apply to public
companies that file Form 10-K with the SEC; however, more and more compa-
nies are opting for voluntary compliance to insulate themselves from future
litigation risks and unforeseen management liabilities.
16
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

This section is intended to give you a broad view of what the new law con-
tains and what it requires of today’s companies in the United States.
Title I: Aiming at the audit profession
At its outset, SOX establishes a five-member Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) that lets auditors know what they’re supposed to be
evaluating and sets rules about the relationships and ties auditors can have
with the companies they audit. Title I provides for change in six major areas:
 The PCAOB: The SEC oversees the PCAOB, which is funded through fees
collected from issuers. The PCAOB (affectionately nicknamed “Peek-a-
boo” by many auditors, attorneys, and other professionals) has the fol-
lowing responsibilities:
• To oversee the audit of public companies: The accounting profes-
sion used to regulate itself through a voluntary organization known
as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA),
but Enron proved that the old system didn’t work very well.
• To establish audit report standards and rules: Auditors wait
avidly for the issue of these standards and rules to clear up confu-
sion and aid them in performing their day-to-day duties after SOX.
• To register audit firms: The PCAOB is in charge of registering,
inspecting, investigating, and enforcing compliance of public
accounting firms as well as CPAs and other people in the profes-
sion. Any public accounting firm that participates in any audit for a
company covered by SOX is required to register with the PCAOB.
Critics have noted the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
would have been more appropriately named the Public Company
Auditing Oversight Board.
 Work paper retention: Title I contains some new administrative require-
ments for auditors, including a rule that audit firms retain all their work
papers for seven years.
 Two-partner requirement: Two partners now have to sign off on every
audit, as discussed further in Chapter 5.
 Evaluation of internal control: Auditors must evaluate whether the
companies they audit have internal control structures and procedures
that ensure that their financial records accurately reflect transactions
and disposition of assets. Auditors must also assess whether the compa-
nies appropriately authorize receipts and expenditures and verify that
transactions are made only with authorization of senior management. If
companies don’t have adequate internal controls in place, the auditors
must describe any material weaknesses in the internal control struc-
tures and document instances of material noncompliance.
17
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga

 Inspections of audit firms: Auditors must submit to continuing inspec-
tions by the PCAOB. Firms that provide audit reports for more than 100
public companies get inspected once a year. Firms that audit fewer than
100 companies get reviewed every three years.
Title I of SOX also empowers the PCAOB to impose disciplinary or remedial
sanctions upon audit firms.
Title II: Ensuring auditor independence
Title II of SOX focuses on conflicts of interests arising from close relationships
between audit firms and the companies they audit; namely, it prohibits audi-
tors from performing certain nonaudit services to clients they audit. However,
SOX allows audit committees (internal committees charged with overseeing
the audit process within publicly traded companies) to approve some activi-
ties for nonaudit services that aren’t expressly forbidden by Title II of SOX
(see Chapter 7 for more on audit committees and nonaudit services).
To further protect against conflicts of interest, audit partners must be rotated
to prevent individuals from getting too close to the companies they audit.
Specifically, a partner is prevented from being the lead or reviewing auditor
for more then five consecutive years. Also, an auditor faces a one-year prohi-
bition if the company’s senior executives were employed by that audit firm
during the one-year period preceding the audit initiation date. Title II also
requires auditors to report to the audit committee on accounting policies
used in the audit and document communications with management.
Title III: Requiring corporate 
accountability
This section of SOX focuses on the company’s responsibility to ensure that
the financial statements it distributes to the public are correct. Its two main
provisions include:
 Establishment of audit committees: SOX requires each company subject
to SOX to form a special audit committee. Each member of the audit
committee must be a member of the board of directors but otherwise
independent in the sense that he or she receives no other salary or fees
from the company.
 Management certification: Title III requires CEOs and CFOs to certify:
• That periodic financial reports filed with the SEC don’t contain
untrue statements or material omissions
• That financial statements fairly present, in all material respects,
the financial conditions and results of operations
18
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

• The company’s chief executive and chief financial officers are
responsible for internal controls, and that the internal controls are
designed to ensure that management receives material information
regarding the company and any consolidated subsidiaries
• That internal controls have been reviewed within 90 days prior to
the report
• Whether there have been any significant changes to the internal
controls
Title III also makes it unlawful for corporate personnel to exert improper
influence upon an audit for the purpose of rendering financial statements
materially misleading.
 Bonuses: Title III requires a company’s CEO and CFO to forfeit certain
bonuses and compensation received if the company has to issue cor-
rected financial statements (called restatements) due to noncompliance
with SEC rules.
 Bans on stock trades during blackout periods: Title III bans directors
and executive officers from trading their public company’s stock during
pension fund blackout periods. It also obligates attorneys appearing
before the SEC to report violations of securities laws and breaches of
fiduciary duty by a public company. For the benefit of victims of securi-
ties violations, Title III creates a special disgorgement fund that’s funded
by the fines companies have to pay to the SEC.
Title IV: Establishing financial disclosures,
loans, and ethics codes
This section contains several key SOX provisions, including:
 Disclosure of adjustments and off–balance sheet transactions:
Financial reports filed with the SEC must reflect all material corrections
to the financial statements made in the course of an audit. Title IV also
requires disclosure of all material off–balance sheet transactions and
relationships that may have a material effect upon the financial status of
an issue.
 Prohibition of personal loans extended by a corporation to its execu-
tives: Such loans are prohibited if they’re subject to the insider lending
restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act.
 Disclosure of changes to inside stock ownership: Senior management,
directors, and principal stockholders have to disclose changes in their
ownership of corporate stock within two business days of making the
transaction.
19
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga

 Internal control certification: The now-famous Section 404 provides
that annual reports filed with the SEC must include an internal control
report stating that management is responsible for the internal control
structure and procedures for financial reporting. The report should also
state that management assesses the effectiveness of the internal con-
trols for the previous fiscal year.
 Code of ethics: Companies subject to SOX must disclose whether they
have adopted a code of ethics for their senior financial officers and
whether their audit committees have at least one member who is a
financial expert. (For more on the financial expert requirement, flip to
Chapter 7.)
 Regular SEC review: Article IV requires regular SEC reviews of the dis-
closure documents companies file each year with the SEC.
Title V: Protecting analyst integrity
This section of SOX is aimed at preventing several types of conflicts of inter-
est; among other things, it restricts the ability of investment bankers to
preapprove research reports and ensures that research analysts aren’t super-
vised by persons involved in investment banking activities. Title V prohibits
employer retaliation against analysts who write negative reports, and it
requires specific conflict of interest disclosures by research analysts who
make information available to the public.
Title VI: Doling out more 
money and authority
This section authorizes the SEC to spend at least $98 million to hire at least
200 qualified professionals to oversee auditors and audit firms.
Title VI also gives the SEC the authority to
 Censure persons appearing or practicing before it for unethical or
improper professional conduct. Title VI also directs federal courts to
prohibit persons from participating in small (penny) stock offerings if
the SEC initiates proceedings against them.
 Consider orders of state securities commissions when deciding whether
to limit the activities, functions, or operations of brokers or dealers.
20
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Title VII: Supporting studies and reports
This section of SOX funds and authorizes a number of reports and studies
that, for example,
 Look at factors leading to the consolidation of public accounting firms
and its impact on capital formation and securities markets.
 Address the role of credit-rating agencies in the securities markets.
 Examine whether investment banks and financial advisors assisted
public companies in earnings manipulation and obfuscation of financial
conditions.
Title VIII: Addressing criminal fraud 
and whistle-blower provisions
Title VIII imposes criminal penalties (maximum 10 years in prison) for know-
ingly destroying, altering, concealing, or falsifying records with intent to
obstruct or influence a federal investigation or bankruptcy matter. It also
imposes sanctions on auditors who fail to maintain for a five-year period 
all audit or review work papers pertaining to securities issuers. It makes cer-
tain debts incurred in violation of securities fraud laws nondischargeable in
bankruptcy.
Title VIII also extends the statute of limitations for private individuals to sue
for securities fraud violation. Individuals can sue no later than two years after
the violation is discovered or five years after the date of the violation.
Finally, Title VIII provides whistle-blower protection by prohibiting a publicly
traded company from retaliating against an employee who assists in a fraud
investigation; executives who target whistle-blowers are subject to fines or
imprisonment of up to 25 years. (For more on the whistle-blower provision,
check out Chapter 16.)
Title IX: Setting penalties 
for white-collar crime
This section increases penalties for mail and wire fraud from 5 to 20 years in
prison and penalties for violations of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 to up to $500,000 and 10 years in prison.
21
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga

In particular, Title IX establishes criminal liability for corporate officers who
fail to certify financial reports, including maximum imprisonment of 10 years
for knowing that the periodic report doesn’t comply with SOX and 20 years
imprisonment for willfully certifying a statement known to be noncompliant.
Title X: Signing corporate tax returns
This section of SOX expresses that a corporation’s federal income tax return
“should” be signed by its chief executive officer.
Title XI: Enforcing payment freezes, 
blacklists, and prison terms
Title XI adds to the criminal penalties aimed at fraud that are established by
SOX’s other sections. This section amends federal criminal law to establish a
maximum 20-year prison term for tampering with a record or otherwise
impeding an official proceeding. It also authorizes the SEC to seek a tempo-
rary injunction to freeze “extraordinary payments” to corporate management
or employees under investigation for possible violations of securities law.
Currently, there’s no specific definition as to what constitutes an “extraordi-
nary payment.” However, Chapter 16 discusses some interesting litigation in
this area (particularly the Gemstar case). This section also prohibits persons
who violate state or federal laws governing manipulative, deceptive devices
and fraudulent interstate transactions from serving as officers or directors of
publicly traded corporations.
Finally, Title XI increases penalties for violations of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to up to $25 million dollars and up to 20 years in prison.
Some Things SOX Doesn’t Say: 
SOX Myths
Although SOX costs corporations billions of dollars and diverts massive
resources from production and profit-generating activities, it’s not all bad. In
fact, there are things it doesn’t require; this section puts to rest four common
SOX myths.
22
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Myth #1: Auditors can’t 
provide tax services
SOX doesn’t segregate to absurd extremes the services accountants can provide
to companies. For example, in passing SOX, Congress recognized that in many
cases it’s practical and cost-efficient for audit firms to prepare tax returns.
Although SOX precludes auditors from providing certain services to their
clients to prevent Enron-type conflicts of interest, the legislation doesn’t ban
tax preparation services outright. Rather, the company’s audit committee is
charged with the responsibility of determining who provides tax services.
However, some caveats must be considered in each case; for example, SOX’s
ban on software consulting may sound a death knell for audit firms that sell tax
software to their audit clients and provide consulting services to support it.
Myth #2: Internal control 
means data security
Internal control refers to financial controls that impact financial statements, not
data security. SOX doesn’t specifically spell out any data security requirements
for companies. Other legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), has rules about data security, but SOX is
silent on things like password protection and encryption standards. This myth
likely results (at least in part) from SOX’s emphasis on internal control, which
is a term sometimes used by information technology professionals.
Myth #3: The company isn’t responsible
for functions it outsources
Not true. Under SOX Section 404, it doesn’t matter whether you outsource a
system, process, or control or handle it internally — if it impacts the financial
statements, the reporting company is on the line. This means you may have
to directly test the controls at your outside service providers. Or, in some cir-
cumstances, you may be able to get a special type of report called an SAS 70
(type 2) from the service provider; this report documents the effectiveness of
the provider’s internal controls. (For more on the SAS 70 report, flip to
Chapter 13.)
23
Chapter 1: The SOX Saga

Myth #4: My company met the deadline
for Section 404 first-year compliance.
We’re home free!
Sorry, 404 certification is an annual event. And when it comes to Section 404
compliance, a corporation is never “done.” Compliance is a continual and
ongoing process. Your systems must evolve as the company evolves, and so
must the tests that are performed on those systems.

U
nquestionably, corporate America had a major case of “the uglies” as
the calendar turned on the new millennium. Long-buried losses, finan-
cial shell games, corrupt practices, and secret self-dealings were suddenly
thrust into the light of day and became front-page news.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, was signed into law by President Bush on
July 30, 2002, and passed through Congress on a wave of bipartisan support.
The implications of SOX are staggering, and it will be years before they’re
fully understood.
This chapter takes a look at some of the biggest bankruptcies of the Enron
era. It also covers what legislators were hoping to accomplish with SOX,
points out the blatant conflicts that SOX is supposed to clarify, and explains
the rationale behind key elements of the statute.
The Pre-SOX Scandals
SOX raises — and attempts to answer — more questions about companies
than were ever considered before: Are there adequate financial controls and
processes? Are there off–balance sheet transactions that don’t make it onto
the financials the public relies on? Are there any shake-ups in management or
ethical lapses that signal a tenuous future?

Enron events everyone overlooked
Major credit reporting agencies failed to identify the events leading up to the
collapse of Enron, which was at the time the largest bankruptcy in history.
Moody’s Investors’ Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, and Fitch Rating
Services all gave Enron good credit ratings a mere two and a half months
prior to Enron filing Chapter 11. (The story of Enron’s demise is discussed in
detail in the sidebar “A brief chronology of the Enron collapse.”)
The key omens that foreshadowed Enron’s implosion, which SOX reporting
standards now address, include:
 Successive resignations of key management: On August 14, 2001, CEO Jeff
Skilling resigned after being in the position only six months. On October 16,
2001, coinciding with a huge restatement of third-quarter earnings, Enron
announced that its CFO, Andrew Fastow, would also be replaced. SOX now
requires corporations to report changes in management on Form 8-K
within four days after they occur (as discussed in Chapter 2).
Prior to SOX, changes in key management weren’t required to be
announced to the public, nor did they justify scrutiny by the SEC.
 Inaccurate and unreliable financial statements: On October 16, 2001,
Enron announced third-quarter earnings that reflected an unexpected
$544,000 earnings change and a $1.2 million change in stockholders’
equity. On November 8, 2001, Enron further announced that it needed to
restate its financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2001
and for the four years prior, 1997 through 2000. The grand total of over-
stated income was $586 million. Several sections of SOX now place
responsibility on management and auditors for the accuracy of informa-
tion used to prepare the financial statements. (See Chapters 5 and 10 for
a discussion of these provisions.)
 CEO stock sales during a blackout period: During the period from
October 29 to October 23, 2001, Enron employees were prohibited from
selling the plummeting Enron stock in their 401(k) plans. (The average
employee retirement had 63 percent invested in Enron stock.) These
blackout dates were imposed to facilitate a chance for recovery.
Nevertheless, CEO Ken Lay sold most of his company stock. SOX pro-
hibits preferential treatment of management during blackout periods.
 Nondisclosure of earlier CEO stock sales: In addition to selling stock
during a blackout period, CEO Ken Lay also reportedly sold large
amounts of Enron stock earlier in 2001. At the time, SEC requirements
didn’t technically require the reporting of these sales. (Chapter 2
explains the new post-SOX reporting requirements for such provisions.)
 Off–balance sheet transactions to hide losses: A big factor in Enron’s
eventual collapse was the use of so-called special purpose entities, which
were separate companies set up to hide Enron losses on their own finan-
cial statements. This arrangement ensured that the losses didn’t see the
26
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

light of day on Enron’s books. (Off–balance sheet transactions are
explained in Chapter 10.)
Essentially, Enron got banks to advance funds to off–balance sheet enti-
ties non-recourse to Enron, which meant Enron could not be held liable
for the debt, and therefore it did not have to be disclosed on the Enron’s
financial statements. Instead, the debt was collateralized by shares of
appreciating Enron stock. The deal unraveled when the shares began
declining in value. Then, to placate the banks, Enron began to guarantee
the debt. However, since Enron hadn’t reported this obligation previ-
ously, the financials were deemed fraudulent.
 Document destruction: On January 10, 2002, Enron’s audit firm, Arthur
Andersen, admitted to Congress that it had destroyed or shredded an
undisclosed number of documents related to Enron’s use of special pur-
pose entities to hide losses and related matters. At the time, no one
within Andersen questioned or took steps to stop the shredding.
 Rigging the ratings: During the congressional hearings, it was revealed
that Enron had contacted the agencies responsible for maintaining its
credit rating to persuade them to alter their ratings. The rapidly declin-
ing Enron retained its investment grade rating up until three weeks
before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. SOX Section 501
now provides stronger conflict-of-interest rules that prohibit companies
from retaliating if they’re adversely reviewed.
27
Chapter 2: SOX in Sixty Seconds
A brief chronology of the Enron collapse
Prior to filing bankruptcy in late 2001, Enron had
revenues of around $101 billion and was one of
the world’s largest energy companies, provid-
ing electricity and natural gas. The company
branched out into financial and risk manage-
ment service. Fortune magazine had named
Enron “America’s Most Innovative Company”
for six previous consecutive years.
Many experts attribute the initial financial trou-
bles of Enron to its launch of EnronOnline.
EnronOnline was an innovative Web-based
transaction system that allowed selling and
trading of commodities products (such as gas
and electricity) online. However, the system
was neither profitable nor attractive to cus-
tomers. The online encyclopedia Wikipedia (at
www.wikipedia.com) surmises that due to
“the giant cash needs of EnronOnline and the
company wasting money in other areas such as
broadband, Azurix, Enron Energy Services, and
shutting down the original pipeline service which
generated cash flow, Enron virtually drained
itself of cash.” As a result, Wikipedia concludes,
“The Enron Global Finance department had to
keep working up more and more creative financ-
ing moves to keep the company up and running.”
During 2001, the company became tainted by
corporate scandal. Enron shares fell from over
$90 per share to about 30 cents per share.
The following are some key events chronicling
the roles of Enron management in the energy
giant’s rise and fall:

Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 
1997: Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
creates the first in a series of partnerships,
which are established for the purpose of keep-
ing debt from showing up Enron’s balance sheet.
August 2000: Enron shares reach their peak
price of $90.
December 2000: Enron announces Jeffrey
Skilling is appointed CEO. Skilling resigns after
six months.
August 2001: Founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, is
named CEO of Enron (for the second time).
Finance executive Sherron Watkins meets with
Ken Lay after submitting an anonymous memo
saying, “I am incredibly nervous that we will
implode in a wave of accounting scandals.”
Watkins later becomes a role model for corpo-
rate whistle-blowers and ethicists.
October 2001: Enron reports a $638 million third-
quarter loss and discloses a $1.2 billion reduc-
tion in shareholder equity, mostly due to the
partnerships run by Fastow to hide debt. Fastow
is fired.
November 2001: Enron files documents with the
SEC revising its financial statements for the last
five years to reflect previously undisclosed
losses of $586 million.
December 2001: Enron files for bankruptcy pro-
tection and lays off thousands of workers.
January 2002:
The Justice Department
announces it’s conducting a criminal investiga-
tion of Enron. Lay resigns as chairman and CEO
of Enron and several weeks later resigns from
the board of directors.
March 2002: Enron’s audit firm, Arthur Andersen
LLP, is indicted for destroying Enron-related
documents.
June 15, 2002: Andersen is convicted of
obstruction of justice and fined the maximum
amount allowed by statute, which is $500,000.
August 21, 2002: Michael Kopper, a former top
aide to Fastow, strikes a deal with prosecutors.
He pleads guilty to money laundering and con-
spiracy and identifies a web of partnerships
designed to make Enron appear profitable and
to financially benefit Fastow and other Enron
management.
October 2002: Fastow is indicted for 78 charges
of conspiracy, money laundering, and various
types of fraud.
May 2003: Andrew Fastow’s wife Lea is charged
with participating in some of her husband’s
deals.
September 2003: Former Enron treasurer Ben
Glisan Jr. strikes his deal with prosecutors. He
receives a five-year sentence for one count of
conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud,
and he agrees to cooperate with prosecutors.
January 2004: Fastow pleads guilty to conspir-
acy, receives a ten-year sentence, and agrees
to help the prosecution.
February 2004: A 42-count indictment charges
former CEO Jeffrey Skilling with 35 counts of
conspiracy, fraud, and insider trading.
July 2004: Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is indicted 
for participating in a conspiracy to manipu-
late Enron’s quarterly financial results, making
false statements about Enron’s financial per-
formance and omitting facts necessary to make
financial statements accurate and fair. Lay
pleads innocent.

More tales from the corporate tabloids
When a public company’s stock plummets because of a scandal, the event
has a distinctly human element. Employees of that corporation and members
of the public at large may have invested substantial retirement funds and life
savings in the stock, and the betrayal of the public trust fuels an outrage that
transcends partisan politics. Ultimately, it’s the kind of event that made pos-
sible the rapid and near unanimous passage of SOX in 2002.
This section touches on a few headline stories that came after Enron’s col-
lapse and prompted Congress and the SEC to unite in legislative and rule-
making initiatives in order to calm the public.
Global Crossing
Just three months after the Enron scandal, Global Crossing, Ltd, a high-speed
Internet company, also filed bankruptcy in the largest filing ever by a
telecommunications company. The company concealed its ailing financial
condition by swapping fiber-optic network capacity with other companies
and deluded the public by improperly recognizing the revenue. Also, Global
Crossing chairman Gary Winnick reportedly reaped $734 million from the sale
of his company stock before it became virtually worthless.
WorldCom
On July 25, 2002, the second largest long-distance and Internet carrier in the
country became the subject of an accounting scandal. An SEC investigation
disclosed that WorldCom had overstated its earnings by $3.8 billion. The SEC
called the revelation one of the largest cases of “false bookkeeping ever” and
lamented its “unprecedented magnitude.”
The House Financial Services Committee immediately called for pubic hear-
ings into the matter. However, WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers and other key
management enraged the public by invoking the Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination and refusing to testify. WorldCom had loaned
Ebbers over $366 million and even issued loan guarantees to cover his poten-
tial losses in WorldCom stock!
Tyco
In 2002, Tyco International, Ltd. became embroiled in a controversy about
millions of dollars in questionable bonuses, loans, and other payments to its
CFO, CEO, and others. In one instance, Tyco paid an outside director $10 mil-
lion and paid $10 million to the director’s charity.
29
Chapter 2: SOX in Sixty Seconds

In the Tyco case, the public accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers was on
the hot seat. As Tyco’s auditors, the firm had to answer questions about
whether its audit had disclosed such bonuses and why the auditors had
signed off on them.
Adelphia
On March 27, 2002, Adelphia Communications Corporation, the nation’s sixth
largest cable television company, disclosed the existence of $2.3 billion in
off–balance sheet transactions. The Rigas family, which had founded Adelphia
and taken it public, controlled the corporation and had co-borrowed the $2.3
billion debt and couldn’t provide much detail about the transactions to the
SEC. The company’s founder, John Rigas, and his two sons were eventually con-
victed of defrauding the company of over $1 million. John was sentenced to 15
years in jail, while his son, Tim, received a 20-year sentence. Additionally, the
Rigas family was ordered to turn over most of their assets, estimated to be
about $1.5 billion, to a “disgorgement fund” to help compensate defrauded
investors.
Adelphia stock plummeted 33 percent in May 2002, when Adelphia
announced to a scandal-sensitive public that it was delaying its 10-K filing
and restating its earnings.
Four Squeaky Clean SOX Objectives
In the months subsequent to the Enron collapse, no less than two dozen SOX-
related bills were proposed in Congress. The SEC issued a comprehensive

Socking it to the spouse
In one of the more interesting legal maneuvers
employed under SOX, the Justice Department
indicted Lea Fastow, the wife of Enron CFO
Andrew Fastow. The charges were seen by
many as an attempt to pressure her husband to
cooperate with investigators. Andrew Fastow
ultimately pleaded guilty to two conspiracy
charges in exchange for ten years in prison.
Lea Fastow was originally charged with six tax
felonies emanating from her knowledge of her
husband’s activities at Enron and for disguising
money from an Enron side deal as gifts. She
planned to plead guilty to one felony, but
changed her plea when the presiding judge
refused to accept a five-month prison deal pros-
ecutors recommended in the plea bargain.
The judge who sentenced Lea Fastow admitted
she was a prime candidate for a less restrictive
minimum-security camp but refused to allow
her to serve her sentence under the usual con-
ditions given to other first-time tax offenders but
did not publicly state why.

response during a February 2002 press release, and President Bush
announced his own “ten-point plan.” The following objectives emerged from
the extensive testimony, press conferences, and thick packets of proposed
legislation and protracted hearings that ensued:
 Make management accountable. Several provisions of SOX seek to
ensure that management, accountants, and attorneys are held directly
accountable for information that makes it onto a company’s financial
statements on their watches.
 Enhance disclosure. SOX’s provisions address the fact that several key
events and relatively shocking transactions having to do with corporate
scandal escaped scrutiny simply because they weren’t required to be
disclosed to the public.
 Conduct regular reviews by the SEC. SOX requires the SEC to look at
companies more often and more closely, a reaction to the SEC’s declin-
ing to review Enron’s records for several years preceding its bankruptcy
filing and consequential loss to investors.
 Make accountants accountable. SOX seeks to purge the accounting
industry of the conflicts of interest, financial self-dealing, and plain-old
poor judgment that placed the investing public at risk when relying on
“certified” financial statements.
How SOX Protects the Investing Public
It used to be that corporations were fixated on reporting results and the
investing public was obsessed with reading them. Prior to SOX, the general
view was that if companies provided regular financial statements, the public
could simply examine them and make informed investment decisions.
However, when Enron and WorldCom and other companies’ financial state-
ments had to be restated because they were off by millions, the public felt
they had been duped. Congress and the SEC decided that requiring regularly
filed financial statements wasn’t enough to protect the public. There needed
to be much stricter regulation as to how information included on the finan-
cial statements was compiled.
Because reporting problems can trigger serious and tragic consequences for
investors, SOX focuses both on how companies arrive at the results they
report and the reliability and credibility of the reporting process. It also
holds management, directors, attorneys, and auditors accountable for the
end product. This section breaks down those objectives, further explaining
the different sections of SOX.

Chapter 2: SOX in Sixty Seconds

Creating a Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board
One of the key components of the Enron crisis was the demise of the nation’s
largest public accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. In response to perceived
lapses in judgment and objectivity of the accounting profession as a whole,
SOX establishes a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB),
which I discuss in Chapter 6. The PCAOB is charged with the following tasks:
 Register public accounting firms
 Make rules for “auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and
other standards relating to the preparation of audit reports for issuers”
 Conduct inspections of accounting firms
 Perform investigations and disciplinary proceedings and impose appropri-
ate sanctions on firms that violate the rules established for their conduct
 Enforce compliance with SOX professional standards, securities laws,
and other board rules
 Set the board’s budget and manage its staff
 Perform such other duties or functions as necessary or appropriate
Under SOX, the board is required to have five full-time, financially-literate
members who are appointed for five-year terms. Two of the members must
be or must have been CPAs, and the remaining three must not be CPAs. The
chair of the board can be a CPA but cannot have practiced as one in the prior
five years.
Clamping down on auditors
An audit isn’t necessarily an adversarial process, but it’s supposed to be an
objective one. An audit is a process of verifying information and identifying
information that isn’t consistent with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards,
or GAAS (see Chapter 5). One purpose of an audit is so that accountants can
certify financial statements that are prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); certification assures anyone who
reviews them that the statements are GAAP-compliant.
SOX addresses the issue of auditors becoming too chummy with the clients
they’re auditing. Accounting firms, like any service company, have a financial
incentive to cater to clients that pay their fees. A tense audit could strain the
client relationship and result in the accounting firm getting fired. This conflict
of interest is exacerbated if the accounting firm provides other lucrative serv-
ices to the client besides the audit.
32
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Accordingly, SOX Section 201 limits the scope of services that can be performed
by auditors (see Chapter 5 for coverage of prohibited services). SOX provides
that it’s unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide any nonaudit
service to an issuer contemporaneously with the audit, including:
 Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
financial statements of the audit client
 Financial information systems design and implementation
 Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-
kind reports
 Actuarial services
 Internal audit outsourcing services
 Management or human resources functions
 Broker, dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services
 Legal and expert services unrelated to the audit
 Any service that the board determines, by regulation, is impermissible
SOX does allow accounting firms to perform services that aren’t included in
the above list. For example, accountants traditionally perform tax return
preparation services. (See Chapter 1 for more about the myth about auditors
and tax services.)
Rotating auditors
SOX presumes that an auditor’s long-time familiarity with a company compro-
mises the quality of an audit rather than makes the process more efficient
each year. SOX presumes that auditors lose their objectivity when they
develop a close and comfortable relationship with the client. Accordingly,
SOX Section 203 provides that the lead and concurring audit partners must
rotate off the audit every five years
Creating committees inside companies
SOX creates a new class of worker bees within public companies. Section 301
requires that public companies, which are listed with the national securities
exchanges and associations, form audit committees. These audit committees
are responsible for working with the independent auditors and getting them
the information they need, as well as for establishing procedures on related
issues such as record retention and hearing complaints.
33
Chapter 2: SOX in Sixty Seconds

Each member of the audit committee must be a member of the board of
directors of the issuer and must be independent. Accountants and attorneys
are prime prospects for board membership. Also, audit committee members
can receive compensation for serving on the committee.
The audit committee of an issuer is “directly responsible” for the appoint-
ment, compensation, and oversight of the work of any registered public
accounting firm hired by the company to audit its financial statements. It’s
also the audit committee’s job to establish procedures for the “receipt, reten-
tion, and treatment of complaints” received by the issuer regarding account-
ing, internal controls, and auditing concerns.
SOX requires that companies pay the costs of audit committees and give
them the authority to hire independent counsel or other advisors to carry
out committee functions.
Making management accountable
CEOs and CFOs are likely to be much more proactive in making sure their
companies’ financial statements are accurate now that they have to person-
ally vouch for the statements and risk doing time if they’re not accurate.
SOX Section 302 provides that CEOs and CFOs must personally certify the
“appropriateness of the financial statements and disclosures contained in the
periodic report, and that those financial statements and disclosures fairly
present, in all material respects, the operations and financial condition of the
issuer.” A violation of this section must be knowing and intentional to give
rise to liability.
In addition, Section 302 requires that the CEO and CFO disclose all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in controls over financial reporting to
both the independent accountants and the audit committee. Disclosure pre-
vents management from taking a passive attitude toward serious weaknesses.
SOX also suggests — but doesn’t require — that a corporation’s federal
income tax return be signed by the CFO of the corporation in order to empha-
size its accuracy.
SOX Section 303 now specifically provides that it is “unlawful” for any officer
or director of an issuer to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce,
manipulate, or mislead any auditor engaged in the performance of an audit
for the purpose of rendering the financial statements materially misleading.
(How could anyone ever think this type of thing was lawful?)
34
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Taking back bogus bonuses
CEOs and CFOs may be required to give back their bonuses if financial state-
ments have to be restated (changed) after an audit due to “material noncom-
pliance” with financial reporting requirements due to fraudulent activity. SOX
Section 304 provides that CEOs and CFOs must “reimburse the issuer for any
bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received”
during the 12 months following the issuance or filing of the noncompliant
document and “any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer”
during that period.
Banning blackouts
SOX Section 306 prohibits officers and directors from pulling “a Fastow.”
Officers, directors, and other insiders aren’t allowed to sell their stock during
blackout periods, as Kenneth Lay did during Enron’s blackout period when
its stock plummeted more than $5 per share.
Any profits resulting from sales in violation of this Section are recoverable by
the issuing company. If the company fails to sue under this provision, a suit
can be initiated by “the owner of any security of the issuer,” meaning any
shareholder.
SOX Section 306 is the only section of the statute that shareholders may use
to sue a company directly on their own behalf. Under other sections of SOX,
only the SEC may initiate a lawsuit against a company.
Ratcheting up reporting
Federal securities law is based on the premise that investors in a public com-
pany have a right to know the facts and circumstances that would reasonably
and fairly influence their decisions to invest in the company.
SOX attempts to ensure that investors are fairly well-informed by adding the
following provisions to existing law:
 Reflection of accounting adjustments: SOX Section 401(a) requires 
that companies’ financial reports “reflect all material correcting adjust-
ments . . . that have been identified by a registered accounting firm.”
 Disclosure of off–balance sheet transactions: SOX requires that a com-
pany’s annual and quarterly financial reports disclose all material
35
Chapter 2: SOX in Sixty Seconds

off–balance sheet transactions and other relationships with “unconsoli-
dated entities” that may have a material current or future effect on the
company’s financial condition. Chapter 4 contains more coverage of
off–balance sheet transactions.
 Real-time reporting of key events: Companies need to disclose informa-
tion on material changes in their financial conditions or operations on a
rapid and current basis on Form 8-K reports (see Chapter 3).
Purging company conflicts of interest
Under SOX, auditors cannot accept jobs with their clients until they have
taken off a complete audit cycle. This restriction makes sense because an
auditor may otherwise hesitate to alienate a prospective employer.
Under SOX Section 206, CEOs, controllers, CFOs, chief accounting officers,
and persons in equivalent positions can’t have been employed by the com-
pany’s audit firm during the one-year period preceding the audit.
It’s also unlawful under SOX Section 402(a) for a company to lend money to
any director or executive officer. Under Section 403, directors, officers, and
10-percent owners must report designated transactions by the end of the
second business day following the transaction so that the public can follow
what the “insiders” are doing.
Exercising internal control
The dreaded SOX Section 404 requires that companies include in their Form
10-K annual reports an internal control report that states:
 Management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining an ade-
quate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control
structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting. The
assessment must include disclosure of any identified “material weak-
ness” in the company’s internal control over financial reporting existing
at the company’s fiscal year-end.
 The framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of
their controls.
 That the company’s auditor has attested to the adequacy of manage-
ment’s assessment and the company’s internal control over financial
reporting.
Chapter 11 covers these requirements of Section 404 in-depth.
36
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Looking at lawyers
SOX was one scandal in which lawyers weren’t directly implicated — no high-
profile ones went to jail or had to do the perp walk on the 6 o’clock news, but
that doesn’t mean they emerged unscathed. SOX increases the level of regula-
tion, which applies to them as well.
Section 602(d) establishes rules setting minimum standards for professional
conduct for attorneys practicing before the SEC.
Waiting seven years to shred
Under SOX Section 802(a), it’s a felony to knowingly destroy or create docu-
ments to “impede, obstruct, or influence” any existing or contemplated fed-
eral investigation. This is a SOX section that impacts the criminal provisions
of the law and thus impacts all organizations, not just public companies.
Auditors are required to maintain “all audit or review work papers” for seven
years from the dates their reports are issued.
Putting bad management behind bars
SOX subjects white-collar criminals to the same tough-sentencing trends that
have been imposed on other types of criminals for some time. It also
enhances some existing penalties, such as increasing maximum penalties for
mail and wire fraud from five to ten years.
Criminal penalties including fines up to $5 million and prison terms of up to
20 years for securities fraud are imposed for the following:
 It’s a crime under SOX to tamper with a record or otherwise impede an
“official proceeding” (that is, to shred documents).
 Individuals who misstate financial statements filed with the SEC can
expect maximum penalties for “willful” violations.
 Sections of SOX impose prison time of up to 20 years and fines for per-
sons who corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal any document
with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability.
SOX extends the statute of limitations on civil fraud claims to the earlier of
five years from the fraud, or two years after the fraud was discovered. (Prior
to that it was three years from the fraud or one year from discovery.)
37
Chapter 2: SOX in Sixty Seconds

Freezing bonuses
The SEC is authorized to freeze an extraordinary payment to any director,
officer, partner, controlling person, agent, or employee of a company during
an investigation of possible violations of securities laws.
Blackballing officers and directors
The SEC may issue an order to prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, 
permanently or temporarily, any person who has committed securities fraud
(specifically, violated Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934) from acting as an officer or director of a public company if the SEC has
found that his or her conduct “demonstrates unfitness” to serve as an officer
or director.
Providing whistle-blower protection
Whistle-blowers are employees who report information about corporate fraud
or mismanagement. Under SOX, employees of issuers and accounting firms
are extended whistle-blower protection. These protections prohibit employers
from taking certain actions against employees who disclose information to,
among others, parties in a judicial proceeding involving a fraud claim.
Whistle-blowers are also granted a remedy of special damages and attorney’s
fees. (For more on whistle-blowers, check out Chapter 16.)
Rapid Rulemaking Regrets
With the passage of SOX, Congress required the SEC to make substantive
rules to be enforced by the agency in 19 major areas. This requirement meant
that there was an abbreviated period for both public commentary and the
drafting process itself. Undoubtedly, many aspects of these rules will be sub-
ject to interpretation or revision as enforcement efforts unfold.

T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, passed in 2002 is the most far-reaching
attempt to protect investors since Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1933
Securities Act following the Great Depression. Like the New Deal securities
laws of the 1930s, SOX comes on the heels of widespread disillusionment
about corporate integrity. It signals a new era in the relationship among busi-
ness, government, and the investing public.
SOX isn’t a stand-alone piece of legislation: It’s part of the complex tapestry
of federal securities regulations and statutes that have been carefully woven
by Congress over the last seven decades.
This chapter gives you an overview of securities law and the important his-
torical context of SOX. Understanding the objectives of securities law and
how SOX serves those objectives can help you better understand your com-
pany’s current reporting obligations and prepare for future legislative trends.
Pre-SOX Securities Laws
To develop a sound SOX strategy for your company, you need to be aware of
the securities laws that define the legal context of SOX and are altered by its
provisions. SOX amends many of the securities laws discussed in this section.

In the 1930s, the idea of laws to protect the investing public took hold among
a hardworking generation that had known the devastation of a stock market
crash. Just prior to his 1932 reelection bid, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
assigned a former Federal Trade Commissioner, Huston Thompson, the task of
drafting a securities law proposal to woo a depression-dazed electorate on the
campaign trail.
Mr. Huston and the committee that convened to review his draft were faced
with an early dilemma: Should the role of government be to protect the
public from poor investments (a merit system) or to simply to make sure that
the public had enough information to evaluate investments on their own (a
disclosure system)? In the end, the draft legislation opted for the disclosure
approach, which is still used today. (For more on the disclosure system, see
the sidebar “Disclosure and merit at the state level.”)
The laws that ultimately emerged from Mr. Huston’s draft are the Securities
Act of 1933 (also known as the 1933 Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (also known as the 1934 Act). Decades after their drafting, these two
statutes remain the backbone of the federal securities regulation system. The
objective of these laws goes beyond simply ensuring companies fill out the
right forms; the disclosures required are designed to provide all the informa-
tion necessary for an investor to determine the true value of an investment
offered to the public.
SOX is an attempt to modernize existing securities laws to ensure that they
continue to meet the statutes’ objective in the 21st century. The premise of
federal securities law, then and now, is that government plays an important
role in protecting the investing public from shaky securities.
40
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 
Disclosure and merit at the state level
It’s important to understand that the 1933 Act
has always been exclusively based on disclo-
sure and not merit. As one federal judge aptly
put it, any company has the right to offer and
investors to buy any “hair-brained investment
scheme” as long as it’s accurately described.
According to Richard Kranitz, a securities attor-
ney with over 30 years of experience, “State
merit review laws have generally been repealed
because voters over time recognized that 
regulators were no better than investors at
picking winning stocks.”
The federal National Securities Markets
Improvements Act (NSMIA), passed in 1996,
encourages the elimination of merit review, and
now only a few states still have those rules in
effect. The NSMIA preempted state regulation
of national offerings but preserved the role of
states in prosecuting fraud cases.

The Securities Act of 1933: Arming
investors with information
The Securities Act of 1933 is sometimes referred to as the “truth in securities”
law because it requires that investors receive adequate and thorough financial
information about significant aspects of securities being offered for public
sale. It expressly prohibits deceit, misrepresentation, and other fraud in the
sale of securities. The 1933 Act contains a detailed registration process that
companies must comply with before they can offer securities to the public.
The burden and expense of completing the forms is the responsibility of the
registering company, which is referred to as the issuer.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) examines all registration
documents for compliance with the 1933 Act. If the SEC determines informa-
tion is missing or inaccurate, the issuer may be denied registration and the
right to sell its securities in the United States. (Section 5(a) of the 1933 Act
provides that it’s “unlawful” to offer to sell a security to the public unless a
registration statement is in effect.)
Companies undergoing the registration process are required to provide infor-
mation about:
 The company’s properties and business
 The types of securities to be offered for sale, as in stocks, bonds, shares
indentures, partnership interests, and so on
 Background on the management of the company
The registration statement must also include financial statements certified by
independent accountants. (The requirements for audited financial statements
for these statements are discussed more fully in Chapter 4.)
In order to comply with disclosure requirements, companies generally dis-
tribute a document called a prospectus to potential investors. The content of
the prospectus is governed by the 1933 Act, which provides that “a prospec-
tus shall contain the information contained in the registration statement.”
This instruction is somewhat misleading because companies usually create
these documents in reverse — drafting a prospectus prior to preparing a reg-
istration statement and then including a copy of the prospectus in the regis-
tration statement filing.
41
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934:
Establishing the SEC
Although the 1933 Act set ambitious goals and standards for disclosure (see
the preceding section), it was silent on the practical aspect of enforcement.
To plug this hole, Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
which established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to imple-
ment the 1933 Act.
Overview of the 1934 Act
The 1934 Act established the ground rules under which the purchasers of
securities may resell and trade shares by:
 Requiring sellers of securities to register as broker dealers
 Creating regulated securities exchanges
 Defining the duties of companies whose securities are traded among
investors
In effect, the 1934 Act requires a company to make certain information avail-
able to the public so that company shareholders may resell their stock to
members of the general public.
Half of all securities sold in the U.S. are private placement offerings, which
are not subject to registration under the 1933 Act but are subject to the civil
liability and anti-fraud provisions of the 1934 Act. (For more information
about private placements, see the sidebar “Keeping offerings private under
Regulation D.”)
Powers given to the SEC
Under the 1934 Act, the SEC has the power to register, regulate, and oversee
brokerage firms, transfer agents, and clearing agencies as well as the nation’s
securities stock exchanges.
Periodic reporting requirements under the 1934 Act require full disclosure of
facts subsequent to filing that are material or significant enough to affect
investors’ decision-making processes. The 1934 Act also identifies and pro-
hibits certain types of conduct in the markets, such as insider trading and
market manipulation, and provides the SEC with disciplinary powers over
regulated entities and persons associated with them.
The SEC’s rulemaking authority for SOX
The 1934 Act gives the SEC the authority to supplement securities laws by
making its own rules for carrying them out. The SEC passes its own regula-
tions, which have the same force, effect, and authority as laws passed by
Congress.
42
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Accordingly, the SEC is in charge of making rules to implement the broad statu-
tory provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In fact, SOX specifically requires that
the SEC make rules in 19 different areas! Congress required that rules in 12 of
these areas by passed within 12 months of the date SOX was enacted in 2002.
As a result, many SOX analysts worry that with so little time for public com-
ment, the rapid rulemaking will give rise to interpretive issues in the future.
Periodic reporting under the 1934 Act
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directs the SEC to require periodic
reporting of information by companies with publicly traded securities. These
companies must submit 10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports, and
43
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations
Keeping offerings private under Regulation D
The term private placement refers to the offer
and sale of any security by a brokerage firm to
certain investors but not to the general public.
Private offerings are “exempt from registration
under the 1933 Act, subject to specific exemp-
tions contained in Sections 3(b) 4(2) of the 1933
Act as interpreted by SEC Regulation D.”
However, private placements may still be sub-
ject to portions of the 1934 Act and to state
securities laws requiring registration as well as
to certain provisions of SOX.
Regulation D Sections 504–506 establish three
types of exemptions from the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act:
 Rule 504 applies to transactions in which
no more than $1 million of securities are
sold in any consecutive 12-month period.
Rule 504 doesn’t limit the number of
investors. These types of offerings remain
subject to federal anti-fraud provisions and
civil liability provisions of the 1934 Act if they
raise more than $1 million.
 Rule 505 applies to transactions in which
not more than $5 million of securities are
sold in any consecutive 12-month period.
Sales of the security cannot be made to
more than 35 “non-accredited” investors
but can be made to an unlimited number of
accredited investors. An issuer under this
section can’t use any general solicitation
advertising to sell its securities.
 Rule 506 has no dollar limitation of the
offering. An exemption under this section is
available for offerings sold to not more than
35 non-accredited purchasers and an
unlimited number of accredited investors.
Rule 506 requires an issuer to make a sub-
jective determination that at the time 
the shares are sold, each non-accredited
purchaser meets a certain sophistication
standard.
For purposes of Regulation D, an accredited
investor is defined in Rule 501(a) as someone
who has the following characteristics:
 Is a director, executive officer, or general
partner of the issuer
 Has a net worth either individually or jointly
with their spouse that equals or exceeds $1
million
 Has income in excess of $200,000 per year
(or $300,000, jointly with spouse) for each of
the two most recent years and reasonably
expects an income in excess of $200,000 in
current year

Form 8-K for significant events. These reports are made available to the public
through the SEC’s EDGAR database located at www.sec.gov. (I discuss the 
10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K in more detail in the section “The Post-SOX Paper Trail”
later in this chapter.)
Additionally, the 1934 Act imposes special reporting requirements on compa-
nies in the following contexts:
 Proxy solicitations: The SEC uses a procedure called proxy to allow geo-
graphically distant shareholders to participate in elections without
attending meetings. Naturally, persons seeking control, including insid-
ers hoping to retain control, solicit those proxies for their candidates.
Companies must file materials with the SEC in advance of any such 
solicitations.
 Tender offers: The 1934 Act requires disclosure of important informa-
tion by anyone seeking to acquire more than 5 percent of a company’s
securities by direct purchase, also known as a tender offer.
 Exchanges and associations: The 1934 Act requires that exchanges, bro-
kers and dealers, transfer agents, and clearing agencies report to the SEC.
The 1933 Act covers offers and sales by issuers (companies whose securities
are offered), while the 1934 Act defines what information those companies
must make available to permit their shareholders to trade company shares
after purchasing them.
Insider trading provisions
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 establishes that it’s illegal
for management, directors, and other people having “inside” knowledge
about a company to use that information themselves or pass it on to others
so that they can use it improperly to gain a financial benefit for themselves.
Every member of the public should have an equal advantage when it comes
to investing in public companies.
SOX Section 403(a) strengthens Section 16 of the 1934 Act by requiring com-
pany insiders to disclose to the SEC information about their stock transac-
tions within two business days of when they occur. These disclosures are
made on an 8-K filing, which I explain in the “The Post-Sox Paper Trail” sec-
tion later in the chapter.
Trading securities while in possession of information that’s not available to the
public is illegal if that information is material to the value of the investment.
Other securities laws
As part of an overall regulatory scheme to protect investors, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act impacts disclosures required under the following laws:
44
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

 The Trust Indenture Act of 1939: Contains requirements on debt securi-
ties such as bonds, debentures, and notes that are offered for public
sale. Most of the SOX provisions amending the 1934 Act apply to securi-
ties governed under this provision.
 Investment Company Act of 1940: Regulates mutual funds and companies
that invest in other companies and whose own securities are offered to
the investing public. SOX’s accounting disclosure and management certifi-
cation requirements specifically apply to investment companies defined in
this act.
 Investment Advisers Act of 1940: Requires that firms or sole practition-
ers who have at least $25 million in assets and advise others about secu-
rities investments register with the SEC. (Instead of selling a security as
a broker, the advisor recommends the purchase of the security.) SOX’s
prohibitions on accountants performing nonaudit services (see Chapter
5) directly affect the services that can offered by many of the firms regis-
tered under this act. Also related to this act, SOX provides criminal pro-
visions that directly apply to investment advisors.
The Scope of SOX: Securities and Issuers
To understand which parts of SOX apply to your company, you need to
understand what type of investments are considered securities and which
types of issuers are subject to or exempt from SOX.
For example, Section 807 creates a new securities fraud provision that appears
in the criminal code. This provision makes it a crime “to defraud any person in
connection with a security” or to obtain “by means of false or fraudulent pre-
tenses, representations or promises, any money or property in connection
with the sale or purchase of any security.” In order to determine whether
you’ve broken the law under Section 807 and can be sent to jail, you need to
know if the transaction you’ve conducted involves a security. If it doesn’t, you
may still be sued in a civil action for fraud but won’t serve time in a federal
penitentiary under this provision.
What is a “security”?
SOX makes reference to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 for purposes of defining what is and is not a security. Both acts
contain similar specific definitions. The 1933 Act uses the following language:
[T]he term “security” means any note, stock, treasury stock, bond,
debenture, security, future, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of inter-
est or participation in any profit-sharing agreement . . . , pre-organization
45
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting
trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security . . . or warrant or right
to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing
There has long been confusion about the term investment contract as it’s used
in the definition of a security along with all the other terms. The use of this
particular phrase has really extended the scope of transactions the statute
covers. Those words don’t have any real meaning in a commercial context, so
the courts have had to interpret them in deciding when an agreement between
two or more parties constitutes an investment contract that’s subject to the
registration and reporting requirements of federal securities law.
A famous Supreme Court case in the 1940s, SEC v. WJ Howey Co., made it
clear that federal securities law covers a broad scope of commercial trans-
actions. In this case, the court held that companies that offered sections of
orange groves for sale along with contracts to harvest the oranges and dis-
tribute the profits were indeed selling investment contracts subject to federal
securities law and had to register such contracts with the SEC.
In the Howey case, the Supreme Court stated that the test for whether the
securities laws apply in a given transaction is “whether the scheme involves
an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely
from the efforts of others.” Although this is a pretty broad definition, not all
investments are considered securities under SOX. For example, courts have
also held that transactions such as purchasing a share in a cooperative hous-
ing project or participating in a pension plan funded solely by employers
(with no employee contribution) aren’t securities.
Under the Howey case, the key questions to ask in determining whether a
particular transaction may be a security subject to SOX are:
 Is there an investment of money?
 Is this a common enterprise?
 Is there expectation of profits?
 Do profits come solely from the investments of others?
Who is an “issuer”?
SOX provides that issuers of all stock in all publicly traded corporations of all
sizes must meet its requirements — that’s a lot of issuers. Issuer is the term
used to refer to companies that sell securities to the public and either are
required to register with the SEC or meet the requirements for an exemption
from registration.
46
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Your company is required to register its securities if they’re going to be
traded on a securities exchange or if the company meets certain criteria with
respect to the number of shareholders and the amount of assets held.
Section 207(a) of SOX identifies the types of issuers that are subject to SOX,
including:
 Companies whose securities trade on a securities exchange: Companies
that offer stock to the public though the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
or other stock exchange must register securities under Section 12(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (For more about stock exchanges, see
the sidebar “How stock exchanges work.”)
 Companies with more than 500 investors and $10 million in assets:
SOX requires issuers with over $10 million in assets to register securities
that are held by at least 500 persons, regardless of whether the securi-
ties are traded on a securities exchange. These companies are required
to register under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act.
 Companies with more than 300 investors: Some companies aren’t
required to file under 12(g) of the 1934 Act because they have less than
500 shareholders. However, if these companies have more than 300 secu-
rities holders (and therefore don’t qualify for a specific registration
exemption), they must file under Section 15(d) of the 1934 Act. This cat-
egory of issuers often includes companies that have privately held stock
but offer debt instruments (such as bonds) to the public. Offering debt
pushes them over the 300-investor mark.
 Voluntary filers: Some companies decide to file reports with the SEC for
a variety of reasons even though they’re not legally required to do so.
For example, to trade stocks on NASDAQ (which isn’t technically a stock
exchange), a company must file SEC disclosures even if it isn’t otherwise
required to do so.
 Companies with registrations pending: A company conducting an initial
public offering of equity or debt securities must file a registration state-
ment on one of the public offering forms, one of the S-series forms, or
one of the SB-series forms. Then the company must file three 10-Qs and
one 10-K in the first year (even if it hasn’t filed under the 1934 Act).
Upon filing these statements these companies become subject to many
provisions of SOX.
When interpreting the requirements of SOX, it’s important to look at each
particular statutory provision for definitions and criteria identifying to whom
that particular statute applies. Some sections of SOX apply to management,
and others apply to auditors or benefit plan administrators.
47
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

The SOX surprise
Because they’re not required to register with the SEC, some companies have
been surprised to learn that parts of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act apply to them.
However, the fact that a company is exempt from registering with the SEC
doesn’t mean it’s exempt from complying with SOX.
48
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 
How stock exchanges work
After a company decides to go public, it has
some important decisions to make about how to
market its shares to the public: Should it regis-
ter to sell the shares on a stock exchange? If so,
which exchange?
In 1792, 24 men signed an agreement to sell
securities among themselves, thus creating the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Today, the
United 
States 
has 
several 
competing
exchanges. The NYSE is home to some of
America’s best-known corporations, including
General Electric, Exxon, Wal-Mart, America
Online, IBM, and Lucent Technologies.
NASDAQ is a competing stock exchange on
which the stock of some equally impressive
companies is traded. It includes many high-tech
companies such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems,
and Intel. Other exchanges available to compa-
nies include the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and
the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).
Companies don’t directly sell shares on an
exchange; rather, they’re permitted to list
shares on an exchange, selling them through
licensed professionals.
Each stock exchange has its own listing
requirements, which may include:
 Levels of pretax income
 Market value and share
 Net assets
 Number of shareholders
 Share price
In general, requirements for listing on the
NASDAQ are less restrictive than those for the
NYSE, which is why many newer high-tech
companies elect to list with the NASDAQ.
For example, the NYSE requires companies to
have either $2.5 million before federal income
taxes for the most recent year and $2 million
pretax for each of the preceding two years or
an aggregate of $6.5 million for the three most
recent fiscal years. All three of those years must
be profitable. In contrast, the NASDAQ requires
only $1 million in pretax income in two of the last
three fiscal years. It also offers some alterna-
tive standards to pretax income that are easier
for emerging companies to meet; these stan-
dards are based on factors such as assets, rev-
enues, operating history, and market value. As
for the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and the
AMEX, both have low threshold requirements
for listing with them.
When a company elects to list on an exchange,
it must register the class of securities under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, agreeing to
make public information available and follow
the other requirements of the 1934 Act. In addi-
tion to complying with federal securities law,
the company may also have to comply with
state securities laws, known as blue sky laws,
in at least one state.

The end of some old exemptions
Historically, the 1933 Act and the SEC have held the authority to exempt cer-
tain types of small companies and securities and offerings from SEC registra-
tion in order to help them acquire capital more easily by lowering the cost of
offering securities to the public.
Exemptions are based on the type of security (for example, a bank is regu-
lated by the Banking Commission, so bank stock is exempt) or on the type of
transaction (for example, sales of under $1 million are exempt from federal
registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D, promulgated under the 1933
Act). Most states exempt offers and sales to only a limited number of
investors (for example, 25 persons in a single offering in Wisconsin). In 1996,
Congress passed the National Securities Markets Improvements Act, which
requires states to impose a uniform exemption under Rule 506 of Regulation
D, which all states must obey. (For more about Regulation D, see the sidebar
“Keeping offerings private under Regulation D.”)
Prior to SOX, these exemptions and waivers left a regulatory gap in the secu-
rities field and meant that many companies in which the public was investing
didn’t have to go through the registration process and little other govern-
ment oversight occurred. Arguably, some shaky companies were exempted
from tough scrutiny to the detriment of the investing public. The types of
offerings exempt from regulatory oversight included:
 Private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions
 Offerings of limited size
 Intrastate offerings
 Securities offerings of municipal, state, and federal governments
SOX doesn’t have any direct effect on registration exemptions. The vast
majority of small offerings are exempt from registration (see the sidebar
“Keeping offerings private under Regulation D”). As of this writing, proposals
are on the table to exempt even more companies. For example, one proposal
would exempt from federal registration any state-registered offering of up to
$10 million in size.
According to 30-year veteran securities attorney, Richard Kranitz, “Even the
most carefully planned and highly funded start-ups involve great risk, but
also potential reward. They also are the source of around 60 percent of all
new jobs in the U.S. and most of its economic growth. They need to be able to
issue securities to raise capital to survive, to grow, and to prosper.”
Some universal SOX provisions
Congress has made clear that it intends some provisions of SOX to apply to
all companies that sell their securities, regardless of whether these compa-
nies are required to register with the SEC.
49
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

These catch-all provisions are
 Section 1107, employee and whistle-blower protections
 Sections 802 and 1102, recordkeeping requirements (see Chapter 5)
 Sections 807 and 902, criminal provisions requiring jail time for securi-
ties fraud and conspiracy
Although many provisions of SOX technically apply only to publicly traded
companies, securities law experts expect that courts and legislatures will
apply the standards of the statute in a variety of litigation contexts and legal
actions brought by investors.
The Post-SOX Paper Trail
Registration with the SEC is a milestone for companies going public, but it’s
only the beginning of the reporting relationship. After a company’s registered
as an issuer of securities, it’s subject to annual and periodic reporting
requirements that extend over the life of the company. SOX dramatically
changes the content, depth, and frequency of reports — the 10-K, 10-Q, and 
8-K — that must be filed with the SEC.
SOX shortens the deadlines for filing annual and quarterly reports for a cer-
tain class of large public companies referred to as accelerated filers. These
shortened deadlines require that reports be filed within 60 days rather than
90 days after the close of the reporting period.
Form 10-K
Form 10-K is an annual report that companies must provide to their investors
and make publicly available on the SEC database (see the sidebar “Researching
SEC filings online”). Many companies seize the opportunity to make their
annual reports glossy marketing tools, touting the growth and accomplish-
ments of the company over the past year. They know their 10-Ks will be
reviewed by existing and prospective investors as well as securities rating 
companies.
SOX-mandated enhancements to 10-K annual reports include:
 An internal control report that states the management is responsible for
the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and
assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls for the previous fiscal
year
50
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

 A requirement that all financial reports filed with the SEC reflect correc-
tions and adjustments made to the financial statements by the company’s
auditors
 Disclosure of all material off–balance sheet transactions and relationships
that may have a material effect upon the financial status of an issue
 Disclosures of changes in securities ownership by management, direc-
tors, and principal stockholders, and information on whether these indi-
viduals have adopted a code of ethics
Form 10-Q
Form 10-Q is a quarterly supplement to the annual 10-K report; it contains
updates to the annual disclosures. 10-Q reports provide a more current view
of financial performance than annual reports, and analysts often compare
the actual data contained within the 10-Q to prior projections that may have
been released by overly optimistic corporate management.
Form 8-K
Form 8-K is a short and simple form that a company must file when certain
types of events occur, such as the ceasing of a commercial activity or the
departure of company officers or directors. The list of events that trigger the
filing of an 8-K has grown over the years, particularly as a result of SOX. The
content of Form 8-K is limited to some salient facts abut the triggering event.
For more on the 8-K, see the next section “Behind the 8-K Ball After SOX.”
Behind the 8-K Ball After SOX
The SEC has always required disclosure of events that are “clearly material”
to the public using Form 8-K. The important change in this area is that SOX
now requires earlier and more pro-active disclosure of material events to the
investing public.
SOX adds several new events to the list of material events, moves other
events to the 8-K from the 10-Q and 10-K forms, and imposes a special four-
day rule for other events. Each of these categories of SOX–specific 8-K events
is covered in this section.
The enhanced 8-K requirements are a legacy of the Enron scandal, which I
cover in Chapter 1. Many of the events that foreshadowed Enron’s demise but
escaped public disclosure would now trigger 8-K filing obligations under the
four-day rule.
51
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

Adding new events to the list
Form 8-K disclosures play an important role in keeping the public informed
about occurrences in small companies that may not capture the attention of
the media.
Under new rules mandated by SOX, the following events appear on the list of
8-K triggering disclosures:
 Entry into or termination of a material agreement: This provision is a
response to the pre-Enron practice of burying such news, such as the
losses of clients and contracts, in the cheery language of glossy annual
reports.
 Creation of a new material obligation: This requirement applies to
obligations of the issuer that are either direct or arise contingently out
of an off–balance sheet arrangement. Enron’s off–balance sheet transac-
tions (discussed in Chapter 2) epitomize the extent to which pre-SOX
management was able to conceal a company’s ailing financial position
while paying themselves large salaries.
 Defaulting on a financial obligation or moving up the date when an
obligation is due: A company’s inability to pay its bills and the accelera-
tion of an obligation by a nervous creditor are deemed events that the
public should know about.
 Ceasing a commercial activity: Investors have a right to know what
business enterprises they’re investing in and when those enterprises
change.
 Write-offs: Reportable write-offs include disposing of or materially
adjusting the value of a company asset or taking action that will result in
a material write-off on the company’s balance sheet. Rather than allow-
ing such information to be buried in the balance sheet, SOX mandates
that investors be informed about material write-offs on an 8-K.
 Failure to meet stock exchange reporting requirements: Investors
have a right to know about this type of event because the inability to
buy and sell their stock on an exchange can dramatically impact a com-
pany’s liquidity.
 Restating previously issue financial statements: If a company makes a
decision to restate, or redo, financial statements it has already issued to
the public, rules under SOX say investors have a right to know the source
of the error.
 Departing directors and officers: When key players are bailing, investors
may want to as well.
52
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

Shuffling events from the 10-K and 10-Q
Certain events that companies used to report quarterly on Forms 10-K and
10-Q now must be reported more currently. Companies can’t lump the follow-
ing events with other reports but instead must put them on their 8-Ks:
 Significant sales: The sale of more than 1 percent of the outstanding
securities or the new issuing of that amount of securities must be
reported on the 8-K.
 Changes in shareholder rights: Shareholders of stock, debt, and all
other types of securities must get notice of any material modifications, or
significant changes, to their rights.
 Amendments to bylaws and articles: If bylaws or articles of incorpora-
tion are amended, shareholders are entitled to an 8-K.
Creating four-day reporting events
Some events are subject to a requirement that they be disclosed to the
investing public within four days of when they occur. Events that call for
these real-time disclosures include:
 Bankruptcy or receivership (a process in which a bankruptcy trustee
manages assets of an indebted individual or entity)
 Purchase of significant financial assets
 Changes in auditors
 Changes in financial control policies
 Suspensions of employee rights to transfer 401(k) plan assets
 Changes or waivers of ethics policies for financial officers
Providing protection in 
the safe SOX harbor
To keep lawsuits from clogging the courts, the SEC contains a safe harbor for
companies that fail to file their 8-Ks in the required time frames. As long as
the disclosure is made in the company’s next periodic report, the SEC will not
prosecute or allow a cause of action to be made under the fraud provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC also doesn’t allow parties to sue
a company simply because it failed to file an 8-K.
This safe harbor doesn’t apply to material misstatements or omissions, and
companies that don’t file 8-Ks are still subject to SEC penalties for failing to
53
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

meet their reporting obligations. Reporting failures also may cause the SEC to
more carefully review and scrutinize the future activities of a company, as I
explain in the next section.
Annual SEC Scrutiny After SOX
SEC Chairman Arthur Leavitt championed many of the SOX reforms long before
they were enacted. However, in the late 1990s, the SEC (under Leavitt’s watch)
declined to review Enron’s books for the prior three years and even gave Enron
specific exemptions from securities laws. “Never again,” said Congress and the
SEC. New rules now make periodic review by the SEC mandatory.
Mandatory review rule
SOX requires the SEC to review a public company’s annual and quarterly
reports at least once every three years. Taking things a step further, the SEC
has publicly stated that the largest public companies can look forward to
being audited as often as once every year. It’s up to the SEC to exercise its
discretion in deciding how and when to conduct its review process.
SOX Section 408 provides that the SEC will use the following criteria in deter-
mining how often to review a company:
 Whether the issuer has had to make substantial corrections (restate-
ments) to previously issued financial statements
 Whether the company has experienced a lot of volatility in its stock price
 How many shares are issued and the cost per share (referred to as the
size of the issue)
 The disparity of the company’s stock price to its earnings (called the
price to earning ratio)
 The influence the issuer can exert over a particular segment of the 
economy
 Other factors the SEC considers relevant
Remedies for inaccurate 
registration materials
By law, the SEC requires that the information provided in the publicly disclosed
registration documents be accurate. However, the SEC doesn’t guarantee that
companies always follow this rule, so you can’t sue the agency for failing to do
its job if a problem arises.

Researching SEC filings online
Registration statements and information docu-
ments, which are sometimes also called
prospectuses, become public shortly after filing
with the SEC. You can access these documents
for free on the EDGAR database located on the
SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. The figure in
this sidebar shows a portion of an 8-K statement
for Toys “R” Us, Inc. on the database.
You can search the database for any of the fol-
lowing filings for a specific company:
 Prospectuses
 Annual reports (Form 10-K)
 Quarterly reports
 Proxies solicitations
 Tender offer disclosures
 Filings by mutual fund companies
The EDGAR database is surprisingly current:
You can retrieve 8-Ks and other documents that
were filed as recently as the previous week.
Tip: Your search on a particular company may
pull up hundreds of documents, so it’s helpful to
limit your search to a particular time period.
Investors who purchase securities and suffer losses must prove in court that
the registration documents or periodic filings included incomplete or inaccu-
rate information. This cause of action, generally, is limited to suing the com-
pany and not the federal government.

Why Privately Held Companies 
Care About SOX
Think that only publicly traded companies need to worry about SOX? This
may not be the case. Private companies that fail to concern themselves early
on with the standards set by SOX may significantly limit their growth poten-
tial and find themselves on the losing side of court controversies. This sec-
tion looks at a couple of reasons why a privately held company may want to
be SOX compliant as it grows.
Bolstering the bottom line
SOX is becoming a model for governing corporations of all sizes. SOX provides
nonpublic companies with a template of “best practices” so they don’t have to
develop structures from scratch as they grapple with governance issues.
Adopting SOX standards can ratchet up a company’s credibility because SOX
structures and procedures are easily recognizable in today’s financial and
business environment. This familiarity inspires trust for investors, creditors,
prospective purchasers, and joint venture partners.
Privately held companies that voluntarily adopt SOX standards can expect to
realize financial benefits that bolster their profits as a result of the following
dynamics:
 Financial institutions and lenders may rely on the company’s internal
control and governance systems in streamlining their own due dili-
gence process. Companies with good governance and internal control
are attractive to institutions that have to assess these processes and
procedures as part of their decision-making process. Good governance
and internal controls inspire the confidence of lenders, investors, and
other decision makers.
 Insurance companies may offer lower premiums for officers and
directors. Good governance and internal control are rapidly becoming
an unofficial underwriting criteria that allows companies to shop for
more competitive rates.
 It may be easier to attract qualified board members who are wary of
serving on boards of companies that lack adequate controls. No board
member wants to feel like he’s just stepped into a quicksand of question-
able practices and lax controls by agreeing to serve on a board. SOX
ensures that good procedures are in place, which can help the company
recruit more qualified board members.
56
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

 A company with good governance structures and internal control is
more attractive to a prospective purchaser. A purchase involves con-
siderable due diligence, and adopting SOX standards reassures prospec-
tive buyers that the company’s financial statements can be relied upon.
 The company may be more desirable as a candidate to participate in
joint ventures when adequate internal control is a selection criterion.
No company wants to be affiliated with a scandal-ridden partner in a
joint venture situation. These joint ventures can be particularly lucrative
to small companies. Nonpublic companies can more effectively compete
for joint venture deals by voluntarily adopting SOX standards, a practice
that may make them stand out among other competing companies.
Defending company practices in court
Even if your company has no imminent plans to go public, it may want to
adopt SOX standards in order to posture and present itself in court should
the unfortunate need ever arise.
In civil lawsuits and criminal litigation, courts must develop and apply stan-
dards of conduct. Courts are likely to look to SOX in evaluating the conduct
of privately held companies and in developing judicial standards. If your com-
pany is sued, undoubtedly it will fare better before a judge or jury if it has
embraced the principles and objectives of SOX, such as adequate financial
controls and management accountability.
Moreover, several provisions of SOX, such as its criminal and whistle-blower
protections, apply to companies that aren’t publicly traded in the traditional
sense.
The prospect of going public
Most budding entrepreneurs dream of developing a business that’s so suc-
cessful they can earn the prestige of going public, or selling shares of the busi-
ness’s stock. As soon as a company realizes this dream, it comes under the
scope of SOX and, more specifically, Section 404’s compliance requirements.
According to securities law expert, Richard Kranitz, Section 404 is the single
biggest concern of most small companies, and as of this writing, implementa-
tion has been postponed because the SEC fears that requiring 404 compli-
ance by small firms may harm those firms severely.
57
Chapter 3: SOX and Securities Regulations

Why would a company want to go public? For those that satisfy the SEC regis-
tration requirements and willingly submit to SOX standards, the payoff can
have the following advantages:
 Consistent capital (if a liquid market for the securities can be achieved):
Many successful businesses survive their early years on successive
rounds of borrowed funds. A successful public offering may yield impor-
tant working capital needed to expand the business.
 Control: In the early stages of business, venture capitalists may want sig-
nificant control of a company in exchange for their financial contributions.
A public offering can represent an important opportunity for a company’s
founders to raise necessary cash without relinquishing or concentrating
significant control in the hands of a small group of investors.
 Compensation: For an entrepreneur living on a shoestring budget while
developing a business that’s worth a lot of money, the prospect of going
public can represent the opportunity to cash in on the success of the
enterprise by selling some of his or her stock in the business.
 Acquisitions: A public company that wants to acquire another company
can do so by issuing stock to finance the acquisition rather than financ-
ing through borrowing.
Taking a company public can cost hundreds of thousands — or even
millions — of dollars in legal and underwriting fees and millions more to
comply with ongoing SEC reporting requirements. And if a company isn’t in
compliance with SOX at the time of registration, taking the necessary steps to
comply can delay the registration and significantly increase the costs associ-
ated with it. On the other hand, if a company has already been implementing
practices consistent with SOX, the process can be simplified (although still
expensive).

SOX and Factual Financial
Statements
In This Chapter
 Understanding the information on financial statements
 Ferreting out a public company’s hidden weaknesses
 Investigating financial information about public companies
 Looking up SEC filings and disclosures
T
he wave of corporate scandals that began 2001 revealed that publicly
traded corporations like Enron and WorldCom were routinely leaving crit-
ical information off their financial statements or burying it the footnotes. This
practice meant that revenue was overstated by hundreds of millions of dol-
lars, massive losses were concealed, and investors could not possibly be
informed about the company’s performance or financial condition.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) arms the investing public with several meth-
ods for obtaining better information about the companies in which they
invest. Great emphasis is now placed on companies’ internal control over the
accuracy of the information that appears on its financial statements, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 11. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) increased other types of public disclosures that companies must make.
Companies are now required to file reports on Form 8-K for events that may
result in exposure to their companies, such as lawsuits or losses of major
contracts.
This chapter explains how to critically review the information on financial
statements, both from the perspective of an investor and from the perspec-
tive of a company attempting to make sound judgments about its required
financial statement disclosures after SOX. It also explains how to research the
new wealth of information about companies available on the SEC Web site.

Looking for Cooked Books After SOX
U.S. businesses prepare two major types of financial statements — the income
(profit and loss) statement and the balance sheet. The income statement is sup-
posed to fairly reflect the income and expenses of the company, while the bal-
ance sheet discloses assets and liabilities. However, as this section discusses,
even after SOX, many companies may have liabilities, risks, and exposures that
don’t show up in the account balances on these statements.
This section shares some basic information to help you read both types of
statements with some healthy post-SOX skepticism.
What the income statement reveals
Most income statements follow a variation of the general format that follows:
Sample Income Statement for ABC Company

Net Revenue
Less: Cost of Goods sold
Minus: Expenses from Operations
Minus: General and Administrative Expenses

60
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 

The income statement (also called the profit and loss statement) is a financial
report that covers the business’s revenues and expenses over the fiscal year.
SOX is intended to ensure that this information is accurately reported and
that profits aren’t inflated with false promises to lure investors.
A new income statement is prepared at the end of each fiscal year. This
means that companies start with a fresh income statement each accounting
period, and each account on the statement has a zero balance at the begin-
ning of the year.
Some key sections and terms disclosed on the income statement include the
following:
 The income section: The income section may include information
about returns, allowances, discounts, and cost of goods sold. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) allows these items to be shown
as part of the income section of the profit and loss statement when your
company feels that such placement makes the information easier to
understand.
 Net revenue: This is usually the company’s sales, presented as its total
(gross) sales minus sales discounts, returns, income statement tem-
plate, and allowances.
 Cost of goods sold: This is the amount it costs the company to make a
product.
 Income from operations: The number you get when you subtract sales,
general, and administrative expenses from net income is sometimes
referred to as income from operations. This is income earned in the
normal course of doing business.
 Expenses from operations: The expense section of the income state-
ment shows the costs of goods and services used by the company to
produce income or revenue. This section includes sales, general, and
administrative expenses.
 Retained earnings: The profit or loss at the end of each year is summa-
rized in the retained earnings account.
 The “other” income and expense categories: Sometimes a company has
income from events that are not a normal or ongoing part of its busi-
ness, such as the sale of an asset. These items may be shown as “other
revenue and expenses” to give investors a clearer picture of the com-
pany’s performance.

Chapter 4: SOX and Factual Financial Statements

Balance sheet (and off–balance
sheet) transactions
One of the major aspects of the Enron fraud was the existence of so-called
off–balance sheet transactions. Sham foreign subsidiaries were created, and
Enron’s losses were recorded on the subsidiaries’ books instead of its own,
thus inflating both income and owners’ equity.
The information shown on a balance sheet is always presented in a specific
order: assets, then liabilities, and finally the owner’s equity accounts. The
information shown on the balance sheet should reflect this equation:
Assets + Liabilities = Owner’s Equity
The year-end balance in the net income account shown on the income state-
ment is added to the retained earnings account in the equity section of the bal-
ance sheet. The equity section (which is sometimes called stockholders’ equity)
reflects the value of the shareholders’ ownership interest in the company.

Some common financial statement terms
The following are some common terms you’ll
see on financial statements and in the media
when it reports on a corporate scandal:
 Discontinued operations: This is where
income or expenses from shifting a busi-
ness location or permanently discontinuing
production appear.
 Extraordinary items: This section reflects
accounting events that are both unusual
and infrequent. Examples include natural
disasters, government expropriation, or
changes in laws.
 Changes in accounting principle: These
are changes in income that result from
changing a method of accounting. For
example, a company’s change in the
method of computing depreciation could
affect income.
 Earnings per share (EPS): EPS is the
amount of income per share of stock. It can
be computed in several ways using the
average shares outstanding or by some
other method. For example, “diluted” EPS is
a calculation that includes convertible
stock options in the calculation.
 Nonoperating expenses: Large expenses
unrelated to the operations of the company
(such as legal fees) can be a red flag sig-
naling future losses or lagging profits. Look
for an explanation in the footnotes.

Here’s a very simple balance sheet format:

Looking for funky footnotes
Companies love to bury unfavorable information in the footnotes to their
financial statements, whenever the law permits them to do so. Footnotes on
financial statements can include important information that doesn’t show up
in a company’s income and balance sheet accounts but nevertheless affects
the financial condition of the company:
For example, the footnotes to financial statements may reveal information
about:
 Pending litigation and other contingent liabilities: If a company is
being sued or expects to be sued, the legal exposure that it faces does
not show up on its income or balance sheet. There is no actual transac-
tion or reduction in assets to record. Rather, information about the com-
pany’s financial exposure to these sorts of events usually appears in the
footnotes.
 Outstanding debt: Financial accounts show the existence of a debt but
not how soon it’s due. Large debts due before revenues are expected to
come in obviously signal trouble for any business.
63
Chapter 4: SOX and Factual Financial Statements

 The accounting methods used on the financials: Footnotes explain the
major accounting policies of the business, such as how inventory costs
and asset values are determined, as well as any other significant account-
ing policies that the company feels shareholders should know about.
 Special disclosures: Footnotes may provide information about expo-
sures and financial deficiencies that don’t fit in the financials. For exam-
ple, a footnote may disclose underfunded pension plan liabilities or
anticipated business interruptions.
Complying with GAAP and GAAS
Each type of business has its own peculiar types of transactions, invest-
ments, and subsidiaries. However, all financial statements filed with the
United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) must adhere to
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally Accepted
Auditing Standards (GAAS), which are set by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
64
Part I: The Scene Before and After SOX 
Some fuzzy footnote language
A problem with footnotes is that they aren’t
required to be presented in any standard
format, which means that companies may try to
obscure disclosures using highly technical
terms and jargon. Here are few examples of
footnotes meant to obfuscate and confuse:
 We have received informal inquiries from
the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to the
accounting treatment and disclosures . . .
Translation: The company may be facing a
costly SEC investigation.
 We received a request from the United
States Justice Department for the voluntary
production of documents and information
concerning . . .
Translation: The company may be facing a
criminal investigation.
 A number of purported class action com-
plaints were filed by holders of our equity
and debt securities against us, our direc-
tors, and certain of our senior officers
during 2001 . . . made false or misleading
statements.
Translation: A lot of our shareholders are
suing the company (so many that they aren’t
suing us in their individual capacities
but have banded together and met the com-
plicated legal requirements for forming a
“class”).
 We may be unable to prevent our competi-
tors from selling unlawful goods bearing
our trademark . . .
Translation: We can’t protect ourselves
from illegal knock-offs that cut into our rev-
enues so significantly that we have to dis-
close it on our financial statements.

GAAP embodies all the written and unwritten pronouncements and policies
of the following:
 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
 Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
 American Accounting Association (AAA)
 Other bodies such as the Financial Executives Institute (FEI)
 National Association of Accountants (NAA) and state boards that regu-
late the accounting profession
GAAS is a set of systematic guidelines used by auditors when conducting
audits. GAAS is designed to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and verifiabil-
ity of auditors’ actions and reports.
Adherence to these standards makes it possible for investors to look at a
company’s financial statements and understand and compare that company’s
performance to others. (For more on GAAP and GAAS, turn to Chapter 5.)
Finding Financial Information
Investors can get your company’s financial information from a variety of
sources, both free and for a fee. The primary advantage of using fee-based
services is that they sometimes present the data users want in a more conve-
nient report format than the free services provide. However, the public can
generally get much the same information about your company using the free
resources available to them.
This section examines both types of resources and gives you tips on finding
the information you seek.
The free stuff
If the company is a public company required to register with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), investors can find its financial information on
EDGAR, the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System.
EDGAR’s Web site, shown in Figure 4-1, is located at www.sec.gov/EDGAR.
All SEC-registered companies, whether foreign or domestic, are required to
file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically
through EDGAR. Anyone can access and download this information for free.
65
Chapter 4: SOX and Factual Financial Statements

Investors can also get a wealth of information from a company’s own Web
site. Many companies, like the one for this book’s publisher, John Wiley &
Sons, Inc. (see Figure 4-2), put special links on their home pages for investors
(or prospective investors) to access the companies’ annual reports. For more
on annual reports, see the section “Accessing Annual Reports” later in this
chapter.
The stuff you get for a fee
The fee-based information services are particularly useful for your com-
pany’s creditors, competitors, or people who want to obtain marketing-
related information about a company. Many of these services have tools to
help you search for a number of companies that meet certain criteria. Some
of the more popular fee-based Web sites for obtaining financial information
include:
 Dun & Bradstreet: D&B reports provide a summary analysis of a com-
pany’s financial position based on the information you would find on the
SEC Web site if you were to search it. You can order D&B reports from
the firm’s Web site, located at www.smallbusiness.dnb.com. As of
this writing, reports cost about $139 each.

 Hoovers Online: This subscription-based service features special tools
to help you search for companies that meet specific criteria and evalu-
ate potential new markets. You can access this resource by visiting
www.hoovers.com.
 Morningstar: This resource, located at www.morningstar.com, is a
favorite among investors for its wealth of services. It provides analyst
reports, portfolio management tools, and popular stock and fund screen-
ing tools that can help you identify stocks and funds that meet criteria
you select.
Accessing Annual Reports
Every public company issues an annual report, which it sends (free) to its
shareholders and to anyone else who requests one. Most companies also
post copies of their annual reports on their Web sites, with links to the
reports on their home pages.

Chapter 4: SOX and Factual Financial Statements

The glossy pictures and the real figures
The annual report is primarily useful to tell you about the company’s goals,
vision, and future product lines, but most annual reports look more like mag-
azines than financial documents. They’re usually slick-looking promotional
documents with lots of color and hype about the growth and future
prospects of the company. A copy of the cover of the annual report for John
Wiley & Sons, Inc. appears in Figure 4-3.
Reports often address various aspects of a company’s business, including
goals and products, as you can see from the example in Figure 4-4. Since the
passage of SOX, most annual reports also contain information about corpo-
rate governance and ethical issues (see Figure 4-5).
Generally, problems such as declining revenues or cash flows are down-
played in the glossy part of the annual report. However, they can’t be hidden
in the financial statements, which must be prepared according to GAAP and
GAAS, as discussed in Chapter 5. The company’s financial statements also
appear in its annual report, further back from the promotional part at the
beginning.

Chapter 4: SOX and Factual Financial Statements

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Accompanying the financial statements in an annual report is a section
labeled Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MDA). This section, which
was required long before SOX was passed, summarizes the company’s results
for the year — it’s sort of a combination of the glowing optimism of the
glossy part of the annual report and the reality of the financial statements.
The MDA gives you management’s spin on the financials and contains infor-
mation such as:
 Discussion of risks
 Year-to-year comparisons
 Breakdowns of financial results according to sectors and geographic
locations
Surfing SEC Filings
The Securities Act of 1933 requires that companies that accept investments
from the public make their financial information public, and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 created the SEC to monitor this process. (For more on
securities legislation, turn to Chapter 3.) The SEC requires publicly traded
companies to issue reports at regular intervals, providing financial data and
other relevant information to investors.
Twenty-four hours after they’re filed with the SEC, these documents are acces-
sible online through EDGAR. You can access and download a company’s finan-
cial information for free through EDGAR’s Web site, www.sec.gov/edgar.
shtml; on the site, you can either run through the quick EDGAR tutorial or
move straight to searching for company filings. Figure 4-6 shows the EDGAR
Web site for this book’s publisher, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., with links to the
documents the company has filed with the SEC.
This section covers some of the specific and particularly useful documents
you can find on the EDGAR Web site.
10-K reports
Every company has to file a 10-K report with the SEC each year. The 10-K is a
more objective version of the annual report, without smiling photos and
glossy graphics (see “Accessing Annual Reports” earlier in the chapter). The
10-K is likely to contain more complete financial statements than the annual
report, and those statements may contain critical footnotes pertaining to
issues such as pensions, contingent liabilities, and taxes.

Chapter 4: SOX and Factual Financial Statements

The 10-K requires several types of information that aren’t included in the
company’s annual report:
 Detailed business description: A breakdown of the company’s perfor-
mance by geographical region and business segment and a detailed
description of its business. (The business description is always at the
beginning of the 10-K.)
 Disclosure of legal proceedings: A description of any legal proceedings
in which the company is involved. (This disclosure is especially impor-
tant in industries such as tobacco and pharmaceuticals.)
 How much everyone gets paid: A list of all the company’s executives
and how much they’re paid.
 The competition: Detailed discussion of the risks involved in the com-
pany’s business and the major sources of competition it faces.
 Legal documents: The company bylaws and other legal documents.
Other useful forms on EDGAR
In each of the three quarters that a company doesn’t have to file a 10-K, it has
to file a quarterly report, or 10-Q, with the SEC. The 10-Q doesn’t contain as
much general information as the 10-K but rather updates the financial state-
ments and the MDA.
In addition to the 10-Q, other useful documents you can find on the SEC Web
site include:
 Form 8-K: This form of interim report announces any material events
or corporate changes that occur between quarterly reports. SOX has
substantially expanded the number of events that require the filing of
an 8-K, as discussed in Chapter 3.
 Prospectus (S-1) Form: The S-1 Form is a prospectus for a stock offering.
Reviewing the information on this form is particularly helpful if you’re
evaluating an initial public offering because the S-1 discloses the amount
of stock being offered for sale and what the company plans to do with
the proceeds.
 Form 20-F: This is the annual report form that foreign companies are
required to file with the SEC.
 Form 13-D: This form discloses information about ownership of a firm’s
shares. Any person or people who acquire more than 5 percent of a class
of the company’s stock must file a Form 13-D within ten days of the
acquisition.

A New Audit Ambience
In This Chapter
 Changing the audit profession
 Making auditors independent from the clients they audit
 Looking out for what happened to Arthur Andersen
 Replacing accounting self-regulation
B
eginning in 2002, a wave of accounting scandals, including Enron,
WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, prompted Congress and the
public to ask “Where are the auditors?” The CPAs who performed audits on
the scandal-ridden companies and failed to detect financial impropriety were
blamed (and sued) for profiting while fraud flourished under their watches.
This chapter explores how the audit profession as a whole came to be viewed
as ethically ailing and incapable of self-regulation following waves of scandal.
It explains how standards set by SOX and the SEC regulations impact the
audit profession.
How SOX Rocks the Accounting
Profession
Both SOX and the 2003 SEC rules passed to further the legislation fundamen-
tally change the accounting profession. These rules take aim at auditors who
accepted large fees from corrupt corporate clients and performed inadequate
audit testing before signing off on the engagement. SOX now mandates the
following:
 Audit of internal control: Under SOX Section 404, the company’s inde-
pendent auditors must conduct an audit on the  company’s internal con-
trol practices over financial reporting resulting in two opinions; one on
management’s assessment, and another on the effectiveness of the com-
pany’s internal control over financial reporting.

 New standards for auditor independence: SOX introduces a new set of
independence rules and regulations that affect accounting professionals
performing audits, including a list of prohibited services.
 Shift from self-regulation: SOX signals a fundamental shift in regulating
the accounting industry, from a primarily self-regulated environment to
a public approach (see “SOX as a Substitute for Self-Regulation” later in
this chapter).
 Establishment of a public oversight board (PCAOB): This board has the
direct authority to oversee and discipline the accounting profession.
 Record retention rules: Auditors must save and store all records related
to an audit for seven years.
An Example of Audit Failure:
Arthur Andersen
In March 2002, Arthur Andersen, one of the world’s largest and most presti-
gious audit firms, was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges of
obstructing the course of justice in the Enron case. The Justice Department
claimed that Andersen personnel shredded many documents related to its
work for Enron while Enron was being investigated by the SEC.
By the end of 2002, Arthur Andersen had ceased operations and was a mere
line on a resume for hundreds of out-of-work accountants, consultants, and
support staff. The firm has come to symbolize the unethical environment in
which audit firms operated in the 1990s and the pervasive conflicts that were
deemed acceptable in the audit industry to the detriment of the investing
public.
Chronology of a collapse
The following are the key events in Andersen’s downfall:
1. The shredding policy memo: On October 19, 2001, just as Enron’s col-
lapse became public, Nancy Temple, a lawyer for Andersen, sent an
e-mail to employees reminding them of the company’s policy of “rou-
tine” document shredding. Two tons of documents were destroyed just
prior to Andersen receiving notification that it was under investigation
by the SEC.
2. The criminal indictment: On March 14, 2002, the Justice Department
announced the criminal indictment of Arthur Andersen. The indictment
76
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

contained a single count of obstruction of justice based on Arthur
Andersen’s destruction of Enron documents.
3. The criminal conviction: On June 15, 2002, the jury handed down a
guilty verdict on the charge of obstruction of justice.
4. Disbanding of the firm: In response to the criminal conviction, Arthur
Andersen announced it would cease operations as of August 12, 2002.
5. The vindication: In June 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the
criminal conviction against Andersen.
The court fined Andersen only $500,000, the maximum criminal penalty permit-
ted under the statute. However, the fine was miniscule compared to the expo-
sure Andersen faced from pending civil lawsuits emanating from its audits of
Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and other former clients plagued by
accounting scandals. The criminal conviction in the Enron case virtually
assured huge verdicts against the firm in all of these cases.
A vindicating verdict . . . years later
Ultimately, in 2005, the Supreme Court overturned the Andersen verdict
on the basis of faulty instructions given to the jury by the federal judge in
the case. The nine Supreme Court justices concluded that the jury in the
Andersen case had been given vague and overly broad instructions by the
presiding federal judge.
Because of the faulty instructions, the court concluded Andersen was con-
victed without legal proof that its document shredding was intended to
undermine the pending SEC investigation. The Supreme Court held that the
jury should have been instructed that the law required the government to
prove that Andersen knew it was breaking the law and acted intentionally.
Unfortunately, the successful Supreme Court appeal came three years too
late to save Andersen and prevent the “big five” audit firms in the United
States from becoming “the big four.” At the time of its 2002 conviction, over
28,000 professionals were employed by the company. By the time of the ver-
dict, Andersen had a staff of only 200.
On the brighter side, the favorable appeal may help Andersen and its mal-
practice insurers defend the firm in pending shareholder suits related to its
work for Enron, Global Crossing, and other former clients. It also may help
some individuals defend or fight criminal prosecution.
Some lawyers speculate that the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision to overturn
the Arthur Andersen conviction reflects concern about the provisions of SOX,
which allow the government to aggressively prosecute CPAs and audit firms.
77
Chapter 5: A New Audit Ambience

Bridging the GAAP
During 1997 congressional hearings on SOX, Congress was outraged to learn
that Enron’s auditors at Arthur Andersen had suggested several adjustments to
the company’s financial statements. Anderson had indicated it was unwilling to
give Enron an “unqualified” opinion that its financial statements were prepared
in accordance Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. (As I explain
in the section “The GAAP all financial statements must fall into” later in this
chapter, an unqualified opinion is the type most firms need to have.)
The adjustments proposed by the auditors would have reduced Enron’s
reported net income for the year from $104 million to $54 million. When
Enron’s management refused to make the adjustments, Andersen capitulated
and eventually certified the financial statements anyway.
In response to this revelation, SOX amends the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 to deter auditors from capitulating to clients in the future. The revised
law states what perhaps should have been assumed from the very beginning:
ACCURACY OF FINANCIAL REPORTS — Each financial report that contains
financial statements, and that is required to be prepared in accordance with
(or reconciled to) generally accepted accounting principles under this title
and filed with the Commission shall reflect all material correcting adjust-
ments that have been identified by a registered public accounting firm in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and
regulations of the Commission.
SOX as a Substitute for Self-Regulation
Prior to SOX, the accounting profession was self-regulated in that CPAs
formed an organization known as the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA). One of this organization’s main functions was to set
rules and standards for its own members, which it did by maintaining its
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Auditing Standards
(GAAS) as well as a Code of Professional Conduct.
Not surprisingly, Congress and the SEC viewed the events tied to Enron,
WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing as evidence that the self-regulation
system didn’t work and established a new government entity to take over 
the task.
78
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Congress decided it needed to do more than make a lot of new rules for audi-
tors to apply to themselves. It created the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) to fill the regulatory gap.
The standards set by the PCAOB not only impact large accounting firms, but
they also apply to any CPA actively providing an audit opinion to a publicly
traded company. The five-member PCAOB has the authority to set and
enforce the following standards for auditors of public companies:
 Auditing
 Attestation
 Quality control
 Ethics (including independence)
Many of the PCAOB’s responsibilities overlap with the AICPA, including:
 Registering public accounting firms that issue audit reports for publicly
traded companies
 Establishing auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and other
standards for audit firms relating to their preparation of audit reports
 Conducting inspections of registered public accounting firms
 Conducting investigations and disciplinary proceedings and imposing
appropriate sanctions on audit firms and auditors
The powers, duties, and procedures are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
Shifting the role of the AICPA
Despite the establishment of the PCAOB, the AICPA continues to play a critical
role in setting GAAP and GAAS that the PCAOB enforces. The AICPA remains
primarily responsible for establishing critical day-to-day accounting and stan-
dards for the profession. The difference is that it now answers to the PCAOB
in deciding how to apply and enforce those standards.
As of April 16, 2003, the PCAOB essentially adopted all GAAS by the AICPA as of
April 16, 2003, as interim standards for audits of public companies. However,
the PCAOB also announced on the same day that it would not rely on the
AICPA in the future but would instead be preparing its own standards. 
79
Chapter 5: A New Audit Ambience

The AICPA continues to set standards for CPAs in the U.S., the District of
Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. By creating the PCAOB
(see preceding section), Congress and the SEC weren’t suggesting that AICPA
rules and standards should be abandoned. Rather, Congress took the posi-
tion that the profession needed outside intervention to enforce them.
The GAAP all financial statements must fall into
In reviewing a company’s financial statements, auditors render opinions that
are included as part of the company’s required SEC disclosures. (See Chapter 2,
where I discuss the documents companies must file with the SEC.) The audi-
tor’s opinion, along with the other SEC documents, is made available to the
public.
Auditors can be sued by investors, creditors, and other parties who rely
upon financial statements they’ve audited.
The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct dictates that licensed CPAs must
strictly adhere to GAAP in rendering their opinions. An unqualified opinion
(which is the kind every company ultimately aspires to get) means that the
CPA has found that the financial statements or other financial data is “pre-
sented fairly . . . in conformity with generally accepted accounting princi-
ples.” If any information contains any departures from GAAP, the CPA must
either render a qualified opinion explaining the departures from GAAP or
refuse to render an opinion at all.
GAAP is particularly concerned with issues of consistency. An audit opinion
not only must state whether the financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP but also must address whether or not these principles
have been applied consistently from one year to the next.
If the auditors aren’t confident that a company’s financial statements “pre-
sent fairly” all the necessary information that the public and the SEC need in
order to be informed, management may be asked to make audit adjustments,
adjusting or adding information to financial statements before the auditors
issue an unqualified opinion.
Footnotes often contain the information auditors require companies to include
because they think it is necessary for the reader to properly interpret the finan-
cial statements. A great deal of important information (such as long-term oblig-
ations or pending lawsuits) may be “buried” in the footnotes.
80
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

If the auditors can’t issue an unqualified opinion, they may instead render a
qualified or adverse opinion or disclaim an opinion. The basic format for
each type of opinion is pretty much the same, except that in a qualified or
adverse opinion, an additional paragraph is added for each problem found
within the financial statements. A disclaimer of opinion is issued when audi-
tors are unable to complete the entire audit for some reason.
The GAAS audits run on
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards have been around since 1941, when the
president of a large drug company, McKesson & Robbins, Inc., and his three
brothers embezzled company funds. A very public investigation ensued.
In response to the McKesson case, the AICPA developed GAAS for auditors
to follow while conducting the audit of a company’s or government entity’s
financial statements. These standards are maintained and updated by the
AICPA to this day, and because of SOX, the PCAOB helps enforce the stan-
dards and discipline accountants who disobey them.
GAAS are divided into three categories:
 General Standards: Deal with technical training and proficiency, inde-
pendence, and due professional care
 Standards of Fieldwork: Address issues pertaining to the planning,
supervision, examination, and evaluation of internal controls
 Standards of Reporting: Are concerned with the auditor’s function of
determining whether the financial statements are presented in accor-
dance with GAAP
Whose turn is it to watch the CPA?
Under GAAS, an auditor must remain independent of the client at all times
and avoid any situations that may jeopardize that independence. These stan-
dards are short on specifics, so SOX and the SEC have concentrated consid-
erable effort to clarify them.
Figure 5-1 shows how CPAs, the PCAOB, and the AICPA fit into the overall reg-
ulatory process established by SOX.

Is There an Independent 
Auditor in the House?
During their exhaustive hearings on the objectives of SOX, Congress and the
SEC identified auditor independence (or the lack of thereof) as the smoking
gun in many major accounting scandals.

agencies
Makes rules and regulations to carry out the
objectives of SOX
Prepares required annual (10-K), quarterly (10-
Q), and other (8-K) disclosures, including

exercises some oversight of accounting
profession
Regulates accounting profession; sets

The importance of audit independence
Auditors are the arbiters of integrity when it comes to financial statements;
they certify that the financial reports and disclosures fairly reflect the finan-
cial picture of a company and were prepared in accordance with GAAP.
It’s an anomaly of the U.S. financial reporting system that auditors are hired
and paid for performing an audit by the very companies they’re auditing.
Despite this symbiotic relationship, an auditor is expected to remain dis-
tanced from the client/auditee both in appearance and in fact.
Some of the ways Congress and the SEC seek to ensure auditor independence
involve imposing the following general restrictions on the profession:
 Banning auditors from performing certain types of nonaudit services to
audit clients
 Requiring auditors to get preapproval from the company’s audit commit-
tee before doing nonaudit services not banned by SEC rules
 Mandating the rotation of the lead partner on a company’s audit every
five years
 Requiring a five-year timeout period for members of an audit engage-
ment team before they can work for an audit client
Every auditor’s dilemma
Accounting firms don’t live on audits alone. Virtually all accounting firms per-
form some sort of consulting or advisory services (such as tax-related work)
in addition to carrying out the audit function.
When these advisory services are rendered, the question of independence
emerges. Can an audit firm objectively examine financial statements prepared
by management while relying upon management to renew a lucrative consult-
ing contract? This is an ongoing dilemma that SOX attempts to address.
The auditor independence provisions of SOX were strongly influenced by the
fact that Arthur Andersen received $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in
consulting fees from Enron in the years prior to its bankruptcy filing.
What SOX Says to CPAs
The SEC has high expectations for the accounting profession and views the
auditor’s opinion as an important instrument in protecting the public.
83
Chapter 5: A New Audit Ambience

The agency has stated that the auditor’s opinion “furnishes investors with
critical assurance that the financial statements have been subjected to rigor-
ous examination by an objective, impartial and skilled professional, and that
investors, therefore, can rely upon them.”
In order to ensure that auditors are “objective, impartial and skilled,” SOX
and the corresponding SEC rules impose upon them the requirements that I
cover in this section.
Give the whole team a cooling-off period
It used to be that accounting clients openly recruited members of an outside
audit staff to fill positions in their own accounting departments, which explains
why a lot of CFOs and controllers started as auditors.
Now both SOX and corresponding SEC final rules require a one-year cooling-
off period before any member of an audit engagement team can go to work
for a former audit client. This cooling-off period is intended to prevent undue
influence on audit quality. The concern is that a former member of the audit
team may attempt to influence that team in order to benefit his or her new
employer.
Prohibit services that cause conflicts
After SOX, many auditors find that they may have to choose between per-
forming an audit or performing other equally lucrative services for a client.
Most banned services are related to consulting or advisory services that
could create a conflict of interest for independent auditors.
Under SOX Section 201 and SEC Regulation SX Rule 2-1(c) (4), auditors are
no longer permitted to provide the following types of services to the clients
they’re auditing:
 Bookkeeping: Auditors can’t keep books, maintain accounting records,
or provide other related services to a client. Doing so destroys the audi-
tor’s independence, as defined by SOX and SEC rules. If bookkeeping ser-
vices weren’t prohibited, auditors would potentially be auditing records
and financial statements they themselves prepared.
 Information systems: An auditor can’t help a company design or imple-
ment financial information systems because ultimately the auditor must
evaluate those same systems for control and compliance.
Prior to SOX, installing and maintaining computerized accounting sys-
tems for large clients were very lucrative consulting services offered by
many big accounting firms. Since this activity was first banned in 2000
84
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

(prior to SOX), many accounting firms have sold off their computer con-
sulting divisions.
 Appraisal and valuation services: These systems involve determinations
of fairness and reasonableness of exchanges of property and money. The
value assigned to these assets directly affects the balance sheet and other
financial statements.
 Actuarial services: Because actuarial services involve a determination
of amounts recorded in the financial statements, auditor involvement
can lead to a conflict of interest if questions regarding the audit arise.
 Internal audit outsourcing services: Sometimes a company needs extra
manpower to perform its accounting functions and may hire a third-
party service provider for this purpose. Examples of outsourced ser-
vices include payroll, internal audit functions, or financial information
gathering. Because these outsourced services are related to some of the
information that must be audited, auditors can no longer perform them
for the clients they audit.
 Management functions: Auditors can’t act temporarily or permanently
as directors, officers, or employees of an audit client.
 Human resources: Auditors can’t act as so-called headhunters and help
the client company find or do background checks on candidates for
positions in managerial, executive, or director positions.
 Broker-dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services:
Auditors can’t act as brokers, promoters, or underwriters on behalf
of a client they’re auditing, nor can they assist in making investment
decisions.
 Legal services: Auditors can’t provide any service to audit clients that
could be provided only by someone licensed to practice law.
 Expert services unrelated to audit: Auditors can’t give their clients
expert opinions on matters that may be the subject of the audit. For
example, an auditor can’t write his client a memo containing his opinion
about a regulatory issue.
All these prohibited service areas are covered in more detail in Chapter 21.
What economic impact does the list of prohibited services have on the
accounting profession as a whole? In the end, it means that the large account-
ing firms simply work for more companies, and the companies themselves
work with multiple accounting firms.
Get prior permission for potential conflicts
Services not banned outright by SOX Section 201 and the SEC rules may be
permitted if auditors jump through the right hoops. If a service isn’t on the
85
Chapter 5: A New Audit Ambience

prohibited list, such as tax services, for example, it’s permitted if the auditor
gets permission from the client’s audit committee before doing the work.
(Services that are banned outright are covered in the preceding section.)
The SEC rules require that the company disclose on its financial statements
any fees it pays to its auditors. Companies must separately disclose fees they
pay their auditors to perform audit and nonaudit services.
Tax services are one area in which audit firms have been given some leeway.
Generally, an audit firm may give tax-planning services and advice to a client
but can’t represent the client in a pending tax proceeding.
Everybody change partners!
Both SOX and SEC rules prohibit long-term client/auditor relationships.
Specifically, they limit the time that a partner can serve on a client’s audit to
five consecutive years. Apparently, the SEC and Congress have determined that
the value of experience is outweighed by the risk of losing one’s objectivity.
Wait seven years to shred
SOX introduces a seven-year storage rule for accounting firms; they must
retain all records relevant to the audits and reviews of any companies that
file reports with the SEC.
Records that can’t be purged or shredded under SOX Rule 802 include work
papers as well as electronic records that contain conclusions, opinions,
analyses, and financial data related to the audit or review. Specifically, the
SEC requires accounting firms to retain any documentation that’s “inconsis-
tent” with conclusions reached by the auditors in the course of the audit.
Recognize when auditors are “impaired”
It’s the job of a company’s audit committee to identify situations in which an
auditor’s independence is impaired and recommend appropriate action. Under
the new stringent standards introduced by SOX, what happens to auditors
whose independence is somehow compromised? A violation of the indepen-
dence rules (see the section “Is There an Independent Auditor in the House?”
earlier in this chapter) may result in a company being forced to change audi-
tors midstream, before the audit is complete. This interruption in the process
can result in considerable cost to the company for duplicative services.
86
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

If the auditor’s impairment isn’t remedied during the audit, the consequences
may be even worse — financial statements may be required to be restated or
reissued.
Section 404: The Sin Eater Provision
SOX requires CEOs and CFOs to certify that financial sins haven’t been com-
mitted on their watches at the expense of shareholders. It further requires
that the auditors certify management’s reports. Two levels of review and
accountability mean more professionals and their malpractice insurers share
any potential liability for corporate wrongdoing.
CEOs and CFOs signing off
Section 404 of SOX requires CEOs to evaluate and report on the effectiveness
of their company’s internal control. This report is included in the company’s
Form 10-K annual report, which is filed with the SEC.
The SEC has passed rules to specifically implement the requirements of Section
404. The concept of internal control and the specific contents of management’s
report are discussed more fully in Chapter 9.
In addition to providing the required report on internal control, the com-
pany’s CEO and CFO are required to sign certifications that are attached to
the company’s 10-K and 10-Q quarterly reports.
Compliance dates and delays
Large companies with annual revenues in excess of $75 million (referred to
by the SEC as accelerated filers) were required to comply with Section 404 for
their first fiscal year ending on or after November 15, 2004. (The deadline was
originally June 15, 2004, but the SEC extended it.)
Smaller companies with revenues under $75 million and certain foreign com-
panies that do business in the U.S. and must file disclosures with the SEC
were given two extensions by the SEC to comply with Section 404. These
companies are called nonaccelerated filers, and they must begin to comply
with the requirements for the first fiscal year ending on or after July 15, 2007.
(The original date set by Congress was April 15, 2005.)
87
Chapter 5: A New Audit Ambience

The SEC decided to give small companies a break because the costs of compli-
ance were deemed “disproportionately high” for smaller companies (and by
at least one SEC commissioner’s estimate were 22 times higher than expected
by the SEC). The SEC also wanted to give COSO, the standard-setting body for
Section 404 compliance (discussed in Chapter 13) more time to establish stan-
dards applicable to smaller companies.
CPAs certifying the certifications
The PCAOB issues standards for auditors to follow in certifying management’s
report on internal controls. The new PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2, An Audit
of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction With an
Audit of Financial Statements, is a 250-page standard that will become effective
upon approval by the SEC. The standard spells out the work required by a
company’s external auditor to audit internal controls over financial reporting
and a company’s financial statements as a whole. You can view the document
online at www.pcaobus.org.

A
uditors are arbiters of fairness and accuracy in the world of securities
and investing. Their job is to ensure that the information that appears
on a corporation’s financial statements is an accurate, objective reflection of
its financial operations.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) ends an era of self-regulation previously
enjoyed by the accounting firms that audit public companies. Specifically, it
creates a new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to regis-
ter, supervise, and discipline these firms. When you really get down to it, the
PCAOB has the enormous task of overseeing ethics and conflict-of-interest
issues in the audit world.
In this chapter, I take a look at the reasons for establishing a special oversight
body for the auditing profession, which has historically regulated itself.
Taking a New Approach 
to Audit Oversight
The need for increased auditor oversight became a potent political mantra in
the United States during congressional hearings in the post-Enron era (around
2001). The media ran heavy coverage of a flawed audit process followed by
the demise of public companies. The public questioned why accountants had
been permitted to govern themselves for decades through their own profes-
sional organizations and affiliations without government intervention. As the
expected response to these questions and concerns, SOX established

unprecedented government oversight of the accounting profession by the
SEC, through its newly created arm, the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, or PCAOB.
Unfortunately, the PCAOB got off to an inauspicious start. The first guy
appointed to head the board, Harvey Pitt, resigned after it came to light that
he was director of a board under investigation. So the PCAOB held its first
meeting without a chair (during which it voted on a $400,000 salary for each
member). Subsequently, William J. McDonough, current chair, was ensconced
only to resign two years later.
This section looks at some history of accounting oversight, including the
responsibilities held by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in
order to further highlight the need for the PCAOB and closer government
monitoring of accounting firms.
The old ad hoc system of 
accounting oversight
Prior to SOX, the SEC, individual states, and the accounting profession
shared regulatory authority over accounting firms that audited public com-
panies. Their influence broke down as follows:
 The SEC maintained standards for financial statements submitted with fil-
ings required by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (as discussed in Chapter 3). It also prohibited certified public
accountants (CPAs) from practicing if they weren’t in good standing.
 The states held the responsibility of licensing and registering CPAs.
 The accounting profession established the American Institute of
Accountants, which later became the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA). This private entity developed standards for
certifying accountants, governing the profession, the content of financial
statements, and the conduct of audits. The AICPA’s standards were fol-
lowed by most states admirably and without incident until the major
corporate scandals of the new millennium (see Chapter 16 for details).
Alphabet soup of accounting regulation
The SEC has only gotten involved in the business of setting accounting or
auditing standards on a sort of peripheral basis, leaving most of the job to
the accountants themselves via the AICPA. To a great extent, the PCAOB is
expected to defer to AICPA standards rather than rewrite them. This section
offers an aerial view of the patchwork landscape of regulations in place
before the PCAOB came on the scene.
90
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

FASB pronouncements
In 1973, the AICPA created an independent body with the responsibility of
crafting accounting standards. The seven-member Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) is administered by a not-for-profit organization called
the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), which appoints FASB members
and funds that board’s activities. SOX creates a mandatory funding scheme
for the FAF and FASB but doesn’t otherwise alter the authority or function of
FASB or the weight that its pronouncements carry.
ASB standards
The AICPA established the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in 1978 to pro-
vide technical assistance and support to the accounting profession. The ASB
issues publications that provide “auditing, attestation and quality control
standards and guidance.” Attestation refers to the process of verifying the
information reported on financial statements or in other documents. The SEC
has traditionally deferred to the ASB’s auditing standards and is expected to
continue to do so after SOX.
The prior POB: An oversight debacle
An interesting note in the annals of accounting self-regulation is the fate of
the Public Accounting Oversight Board (POB), an ill-fated predecessor to the
PCAOB. The POB was created by the SEC in 1978 to enhance audit quality
and help ensure adequate internal control within audit firms. The POB was
intended, among other things, to administer peer review and quality control
programs within the profession. Under POB standards, accounting firms that
audited the financial statements of public companies were required to go
through a peer review process conducted by another audit firm every three
years.
When many accounting firms balked at the cost of paying for the peer
review process, the POB lacked the support necessary to enforce its policies.
Frustrated with its own ineffectiveness, the POB voted itself out of existence
in 2002.
Primary Purposes of the PCAOB
For the majority of public companies, accounting firms, and auditors, self-
regulation was a concept that worked remarkably well. That’s why much of the
new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s function is to promote
public trust and a sense that the government is monitoring the accounting
profession. While the PCAOB provides an added layer of enforcement, it con-
tinues to look to the profession itself to suggest and maintain technical stan-
dards for conducting audits and reporting financial information.
91
Chapter 6: A Board to Audit the Auditors

The PCAOB’s role is primarily one of enforcement, added analysis, and disci-
pline. The SOX sections that create the PCAOB are directed at sorting out the
profession’s bad apples and aren’t by any means focused on overall account-
ing standards or procedures.
It only makes sense that the PCAOB not scrap the accounting profession’s
well-defined standards that have taken decades to develop. Rather, the focus
is on shoring up enforcement of these existing standards and tightening them
as necessary. After all, who understands the nuances of the accounting pro-
fession better than the accountants themselves?
Goals of the PCAOB
The functions and scope of the PCAOB were hotly debated and extensively
discussed during congressional hearings on SOX. In the end, Congress, the
SEC, and, to some extent, the accounting profession agreed on the following
objectives for the PCAOB:
 Revamp standards for the accounting profession. The PCAOB takes a
good look at the standards the AICPA has put into place for accountants
over the last several decades and decides which standards stay, which
ones go, and what new rules should be imposed.
 Investigate questionable conduct by auditors. Prior to the PCAOB,
the accounting profession investigated its members by way of a loose
system largely based on volunteer committees within the AICPA that
were assisted by a few paid staff whose salaries were funded with mem-
bers’ dues. The disciplinary process was perceived by many as subject
to cronyism and arbitrariness, with small firms far more likely to be
sanctioned and CPAs in large firms left alone. During the post-Enron
hearings, Congress seemed to take the view that as a volunteer organiza-
tion, the AICPA lacked resources, training, and government support to
police the entire profession.
 Discipline errant auditors. In its capacity as the new disciplinary
authority for errant CPAs, the PCAOB is charged with administering sen-
sible sanctions in an even-handed manner.
 Ensure the auditing profession keeps up with changing times. As infor-
mation technology and the nature of business conducted by public com-
panies evolves and in response to the increasing globalization of the U.S.
economy, the PCAOB faces the challenge of making sure the auditing
profession doesn’t fall behind the times.
92
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

The seven statutory duties of the PCAOB
Administrative agencies often have overlapping functions and therefore can
be prone to turf wars with other agencies. To avoid having the PCAOB step
on the toes of other state and federal regulatory bodies, Congress carefully
spells out what it actually intended the PCAOB to do — and not to do. SOX
Section 101(c) lays out the following seven statutory duties of the PCAOB:
 Register public accounting firms that prepare audit reports
 Establish, or adopt, by rule, “auditing, quality control, ethics, indepen-
dence, and other standards relating to the preparation of audit reports
for issuers”
 Conduct inspections of accounting firms
 Conduct investigations and disciplinary proceedings, and impose appro-
priate sanctions
 Enforce compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules of the PCAOB,
professional standards, and the securities laws relating to the prepara-
tion and issuance of audit reports and the obligations and liabilities of
accountants with respect thereto
 Set the budget and manage the operations of the PCAOB and its staff
 Perform such other duties or functions as necessary or appropriate
Some Practical PCAOB Matters
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) is the child of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In its capacity of protecting the
investing public, the SEC appoints members of the board and oversees them.
In turn, the PCAOB works with the AICPA to ensure the quality of audits and
financial statements.
Who’s on the board?
The PCAOB is required to have five full-time, financially literate members
who are appointed for five-year terms. Financially literate generally means
able to understand and assess the information in the financial statements
based on professional experience doing so. To balance the perspective of the
board, two of the members must have backgrounds as CPAs (either currently
holding that job or held in the past), and the remaining three members must
not be CPAs. The board chairperson can be a CPA, but he or she can’t have
practiced as one in the prior five years.
93
Chapter 6: A Board to Audit the Auditors

SOX also stipulates that no member of the PCAOB is permitted to “share in
any of the profits of, or receive payments from, a public accounting firm.”
Who pays for the PCAOB?
Under SOX, an accounting firm must register with the PCAOB and pay regis-
tration and annual fees before it can audit a public company. Essentially,
auditors are paying for their own PCAOB audits through these mandatory
fees. This arrangement has a certain logic to it; public companies currently
pay the bill for their own audits. The PCAOB is authorized to set these fees at
amounts that are sufficient to recover the costs of processing and reviewing
applications and annual reports.
The mandatory dues also pay the costs of setting standards and disciplining
the profession. The PCAOB needs research and support staff in order to issue
standards or adopt standards set by other groups or organizations, and
PCAOB dues fund inspections and investigations of public accounting firms
as well as disciplinary hearings and proceedings.
In addition to mandatory registration and annual fees, the PCAOB also estab-
lishes by rule a reasonable annual accounting support fee as may be necessary
or appropriate to maintain the board. This fee is assessed on issuers only.
PCAOB Rules: Old Meets New
Under SOX, the PCAOB is required to “cooperate on an on-going basis” with
designated professional groups of accountants. The PCAOB also has the
authority to amend, modify, repeal, and reject any standards it doesn’t like,
which includes deciding which FASB and AICPA rules and pronouncements to
keep.
The PCAOB must report its standard-setting activity to the SEC on an annual
basis.
Sticking to the ol’ standby rules
The PCAOB, technically, gets to pick and choose which rules of the FASB,
ASB, and other AICPA-created bodies it wants to keep “to the extent that it
determines appropriate.” However, the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB, is
separately authorized to “recognize, as ‘generally accepted’ . . . any account-
ing principles” that are established by a standard-setting body that meets
SOX’s criteria. To be considered standard-setting, a body must:
94
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

 Be a private entity (as opposed to a public charity or not-for-profit 
organization)
 Be governed by a board of trustees (or equivalent body), the majority of
whom are not or have not been associated with a public accounting firm
for the past two years
 Be funded in a manner similar to the PCAOB
 Have adopted procedures to ensure prompt consideration of changes to
accounting principles by a majority vote
 Consider, when adopting standards, the need to keep them current and
the extent to which international convergence of standards is necessary
or appropriate
For the short term, at least, the PCAOB is expected to hang onto existing
standards in each of the following areas:
 Auditing: Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) developed by
the AICPA and the ASB remain in force.
 Attestation and quality control: The PCAOB continues to use the
Statements of Position developed by the ASB for engagements that
require auditors to attest to the accuracy of documents.
 Ethics and independence: The PCAOB relies heavily on the AICPA’s
existing Code of Professional Conduct, which covers recommendations
on things such as an auditor’s obligations to third parties who may be
relying upon financial statements and when impermissible conflicts of
interest may arise in particular situations.
Adjusting to some new rules
New boards bring new rules, and thanks to the PCAOB, not everything is
business as usual for the accounting profession. As I explain in Chapter 5,
CPAs have many new burdens, obligations, PCAOB pronouncements, and SEC
rules to follow. The PCAOB is directly involved in implementing the changes
covered in this section.
Inspections of registered public accounting firms
Public accounting firms are subject to regular inspections with respect to
their audits of public companies. The frequency of the inspections depends
on how many public companies a firm audits:
 Firms that audit more than 100 public companies are inspected annually.
 Firms that audit fewer than 100 companies are inspected every three
years.
95
Chapter 6: A Board to Audit the Auditors

In addition, the SEC or the PCAOB may order a special inspection of any firm
at any time.
Maintenance of work paper trails
The PCAOB is responsible for making sure that registered public accounting
firms “prepare, and maintain for a period of not less than 7 years, audit work
papers, and other information related to any audit report, in sufficient detail
to support the conclusions reached in such report.”
Supervision of internal quality standards and reviews
The PCAOB is in charge of ensuring that accounting firms carry out certain
SOX mandates with respect to public accounting firms’ internal supervision
and review. Namely, SOX requires that a second partner review and approve
audits of reports and that each accounting firm adopt its own quality control
standards.
Standards for reviews of 404 audits
SOX requires the PCAOB to oversee and implement standards for public
accounting firms to use as they conduct Section 404 audits, a special type
of audit that pertains to a company’s internal control (see Chapter 9).
Section 404 requires auditors to:
 Evaluate whether the internal control structure and procedures include
records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company
 Provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded in a
manner that will permit the preparation of financial statements in accor-
dance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
 Include a description of any material weaknesses in the internal controls
Evolving PCAOB Policies and Issues
The practical implications of establishing the PCAOB as an unprecedented
arm of the SEC are ongoing. The public and the accounting profession can
expect further SEC rules to delineate the PCAOB’s powers and limitations.
More importantly, pronouncements issued by the new PCAOB profoundly
impact the accounting profession in a direct way. This section highlights a
few key policies that have emerged with respect to the role of the PCAOB.
96
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Sanctioning sloppy auditors
The PCAOB is empowered to police public accounting firms with an unprece-
dented range of enforcement and oversight mechanisms. As directed by SOX,
the PCAOB regularly inspects registered accounting firms’ operations and fol-
lows up to investigate potential violations of securities laws and accounting
standards.
The PCAOB has the authority to conduct full-blown investigations and hear-
ings, including requiring testimony or documentation, to determine if an
accounting firm has committed a violation. The PCAOB also can refer matters
to the SEC for investigation, or, with the SEC’s approval, to the Department of
Justice, state attorneys general, or state boards of accountancy.
If the PCAOB decides to conduct the investigation itself, it can directly impose
an array of formidable sanctions, including civil penalties, revoking or suspend-
ing an accounting firm’s registration, and prohibiting the CPA firm from audit-
ing public companies.
If an accounting firm violates rules passed by the PCAOB, it’s subject to the
same penalties imposed for violations of SEC rules under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. (For more on this legislation, check out Chapter 3.)
Keeping an eye on small CPA firms
Even accounting firms that don’t audit any public companies may be subject
to the long arm of the PCAOB if their state laws permit. Under SOX, state reg-
ulators are directed to independently decide whether PCAOB standards
should apply to small and mid-size nonregistered accounting firms within
their borders.
Extending authority internationally
Sometimes foreign accounting firms perform all or part of an audit. This
arrangement may be the case, for example, when foreign subsidiaries or
operations are reported on a company’s U.S. financial statements.
SOX provides that foreign accounting firms that “prepare or furnish” audit
reports involving U.S. registrants are subject to the authority of the PCAOB.
Additionally, if a U.S. accounting firm relies on some or all the work of a for-
eign accounting firm, the foreign firm’s audit work papers must be supplied
to the PCAOB upon request.
97
Chapter 6: A Board to Audit the Auditors

Communicating with the SEC
The PCAOB is required to notify the SEC of pending investigations involving
potential violations of the securities laws and coordinate its investigation
with the SEC Division of Enforcement as necessary to protect ongoing SEC
investigations.
The PCAOB also must notify the SEC when it imposes “any final sanction” on
any accounting firm or associated person because the board’s findings and
sanctions are subject to review by the SEC. The SEC may enhance, modify,
cancel, reduce, or require remission of such sanctions.
When the PCAOB Doesn’t Perform
SOX is a piece of legislation that leaves nothing to chance with respect to
accounting oversight and regulation. The statute even provides for the con-
tingency that the PCAOB may become compromised or ineffectual; it states
that the SEC shall have “oversight and enforcement authority over the
board,” which means that the SEC can require the board to retain certain
records and can inspect the PCAOB itself.
Also, the SEC may, by order, “censure or impose limitations upon the activi-
ties, functions, and operations” of the PCAOB if it finds that the board has
violated the securities laws or has failed to ensure that accounting firms
comply with applicable rules.

 Defining the role of the audit committee

 Including private and foreign companies as a result of committee requirements
S
OX requires the board of directors of every public company to form an
audit committee. These audit committees have direct responsibility for
monitoring the independent CPA firm that conducts the audit of the com-
pany, which includes hiring, firing, preapproving services and fees, resolving
disputes with management, and monitoring the quality of the audit. Under
SOX, audit committee members are required to be independent from manage-
ment as well as “financially literate.” In many respects, they’re intended to be
the moral compasses of corporations.
This chapter explores how companies implement new standards for audit
committee independence, expertise, and objectivity.
Deliver or De-list
Stock exchanges, such as the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, traditionally have
had their own rules and requirements that companies must meet before they
can list their stock on the exchange. (The NASDAQ rules are more liberal and
easily met by smaller companies, as discussed in Chapter 3.) When it comes
to audit committees, the NYSE and NASDAQ require corporations listed with
them to have independent audit committees. Under SOX, the SEC requires
the exchanges to impose specific standards for audit committees of publicly
traded companies and increases the exchanges’ supervisory role over audit
committees.
Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC is responsible for super-
vising the NYSE, NASDAQ, and other exchanges. For further discussion of
exchange history and securities legislation, check out Chapter 3.

SOX Section 301 amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to include spe-
cific requirements for audit committees, which I cover in more detail later in
this chapter:
 Independence: Audit committee members must be selected from mem-
bers of the company’s board of directors and can’t be compensated by
the company or its affiliates for any reason other than for serving as
directors.
 Complaint procedures: Every audit committee must have procedures
in place for receiving and handling complaints about the company’s
“accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters,” 
including procedures for “the confidential, anonymous submission
by the employers . . . of concerns regarding questionable accounting
or auditing matters.”
 Authority to engage advisors: A company must permit its audit commit-
tee to bring on board independent auditors it “determines necessary to
carry out its duties” and pay the cost of hiring such advisors.
 Company funding: Companies have to pay for the operations of their
audit committees.
From Audit Committee Annals
The need for more effective auditor oversight didn’t go entirely unnoticed
before SOX. In 1998, SEC Chairman Arthur Leavitt expressed uneasiness over
the rather capricious oversight corporate boards of directors exercised over

In 1997, Cynthia Cooper, the General Auditor for
WorldCom, made a startling discovery. Her
small audit team uncovered billions of dollars of
operating fee expenses paid to local telephone
companies. Instead of correctly reporting these
expenses in the company’s profits and losses,
the company executives moved them to the bal-
ance sheet, treating them as assets, or capital-
izing them.
Ms. Cooper and her audit team realized that
WorldCom management had perpetrated an
accounting fraud of massive proportions on the
investing public. She confronted CEO Bernard
Ebbers with her findings and then alerted the
company’s audit committee. Ms. Cooper was
promptly terminated.
Incidents such as this underscore the impor-
tance of independent audit committees within
the corporate structure.

the audit process, but it wasn’t until the corporate scandals of 2001 and 2002
that Mr. Leavitt’s concerns struck a chord with Congress and the public.
Mr. Leavitt’s Blue Ribbon panel
At the urging of Arthur Leavitt, chairman of the SEC, the NYSE, AMEX, and
NASDAQ sponsored a Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness
of Corporate Audit Committees in 1998. This panel suggested a number of
changes that became the basis for SEC, NYSE, and NASDAQ rule changes in
the following year and later for the statutory mandates of SOX.
Stock exchanges, such as the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, traditionally have
all had their own rules and requirements for companies to be permitted to
trade stock on them. The NASDAQ rules are more liberal and easily met by
smaller companies.
Enron impetus
The Senate subcommittee investigating Enron in 2001 concluded that the
company’s audit oversight committee didn’t oversee much. Expert witnesses
at the hearings testified that the audit committee had not challenged manage-
ment’s refusal to make recommended adjustments to correctly reflect earn-
ings and losses or management’s omission of significant loss transactions
from the company’s financial statements.
The quest for consistent committee rules
In 2002, at the request of the chairman of the SEC, the SEC, the NYSE, and
NASDAQ took steps to harmonize their rules on corporate governance and, in
particular, the required policies for corporate audit committees. In 2003, the
SEC approved the new NASDAQ and NYSE rules, which were drafted to corre-
spond to the standards set forth in SOX.
SOX Section 301 reflects many of the policies and practices established by the
stock exchanges as well as the recommendations made by the Blue Ribbon
panel that convened in 2003. The Senate version of SOX gave a nod to the Blue
Ribbon panel, stating, “[C]onsistent with their recommendations, the bill
enhances audit committee independence by barring audit committee mem-
bers from accepting consulting fees, or being affiliated with persons of the
issuer or the issuer’s subsidiaries other than in the member’s capacity as a
member of the board of directors or any board committee.”

Chapter 7: The Almighty Audit Committee

Starting with a Charter
The NYSE and NASDAQ both require audit committees of publicly traded
companies to adopt written charters. A committee’s charter is a set of rules
and guidelines intended to direct the committee in performing its oversight
function.
The NYSE and NASDAQ rules require an audit committee’s written charter
address the committee’s:
 Purpose: SOX states that this purpose “at minimum” must be to ensure
the integrity of the company’s financial statements, its compliance with
legal and regulatory requirements, and the independent auditor’s com-
petence and independence.
 Role within the company: The charter must spell out the specific duties
of the audit committee with respect to ensuring the quality of the com-
pany’s audited financial statements.
 Policies: The charter must address the audit committee’s policies with
respect to risk assessment and management.
A sample audit committee charter appears in Appendix C.
The Audit Committee Interface
Based on revelations that audit committees at WorldCom, Global Crossing,
and other companies tended to see themselves as extensions of manage-
ment, Congress and the SEC enacted legislation to clarify the role of the audit
committee as distinct from management.
Audit committees are responsible for evaluating management and auditors
and must retain objectivity about both. The committee monitors manage-
ment’s effectiveness in providing auditors with information needed to deter-
mine whether the company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally
Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), as discussed in Chapter 4.
Audit committees should not get involved in performing audits; rather, they
should facilitate them. The internal audit committee provides an essential
objective interface between a company’s management and its independent
(outside) auditors to ensure that, at all times, the auditors’ opinions and cer-
tifications are based on full and accurate information about the company’s
operations.
102
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

SOX Section 301 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to define the
role of the audit committee as follows:
The audit committee of each issuer, in its capacity as a committee for the
board of directors, shall be directly responsible for the appointment, com-
pensation and oversight of the work of any registered public accounting firm
employed by that (including the resolution of disagreements between man-
agement and the auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of
preparing or issuing an audit report, or related work, and each such regis-
tered public accounting firm shall report directly to the audit committee.
SOX makes audit committee members “directly responsible” for disagreements
that crop up regarding specific accounting issues during an audit, including
“the resolution of any disagreements between management and the issuer.”
This provision is intended to keep committee members from capitulating to
management when auditors seek to impose policies and adjustments that
reflect less favorably on the earnings of the company, and hence management.
Audit committees are responsible for ensuring that a company maintains a
work environment that
 Enables auditors to perform necessary testing.
 Encourages employees to come forward with issues that may be rele-
vant to the audit process (see “Handling complaints” later in this chap-
ter for more).
Some Stricter NYSE Rules
The audit committees of companies that trade on the NYSE are subject to
some requirements that are more stringent than the ones directly imposed by
SOX. For example, NYSE rules require that
 A company’s audit committee has a minimum of three members.
 A company conducts internal audits to assist management and the audit
committee in assessing the company’s accounting systems and internal
control.
The NYSE listing rules state that a company may “choose to outsource”
the internal audit function to “a third party service provider other than
its independent auditor.”
The NASDAQ listing requirements can be found at www.nasdaq.com/
about/listing_information.stm. A copy of the NYSE requirements
can be downloaded at www.hlhz.com/main.asp?p=CORP_BDADV_

Chapter 7: The Almighty Audit Committee

Membership Requirements
Members of the audit committee are drawn from the corporation’s board of
directors. By law, the board of directors is made up of a majority of members
who are financially independent from the company they audit (see Chapter 8
for a detailed explanation of the criteria that must be met for a director to be
deemed financially independent). These independent directors may be eligi-
ble to serve on the company’s audit committee if they also meet the other
requirements discussed in this section.
A few independent members
To ensure that audit committees are fair and objective advocates for effective
audit procedures, SOX requires that committee members be financially inde-
pendent from the company in two respects:
 Compensation: SOX prohibits a committee member from receiving any
type of compensation or fee other than payment for being a director
of the company. Audit committee members can be paid for providing
accounting, consulting, legal, investment, banking, or financial advisory
services to the company or for working for companies that provide
these services.
Compensatory fees don’t include payments to an audit committee
member serving as a shareholder who doesn’t have enough stock in
the company to control it.
 Affiliation: A member can’t be affiliated with the company through
family or employment relationships. Unfortunately, SOX Section 302
doesn’t define an affiliated person; it merely states that if you are one,
you’re prohibited from serving on an audit committee. However, the leg-
islative history of SOX and past practices of the SEC make it possible to
determine who will be deemed an affiliated person and thus ineligible to
serve on your company’s audit committee.
The definition of affiliated person used in most other sections of securi-
ties laws applies to SOX as well. Under this definition, a director is con-
sidered an affiliated person if he or she has a direct or indirect influence
over the management of the company’s business or affairs other than
solely by virtue of being a director. Controlling shareholders also are
considered affiliated persons and are therefore ineligible to serve. The
SEC rules don’t specify who’s a controlling shareholder; the only qualifi-
cation is that the person directly or indirectly own more than 10 percent
of the company’s voting stock or equity. However, owning more than 10
percent of the voting stock doesn’t automatically make someone an affil-
iate. In the case of a controlling shareholder, the SEC looks at all relevant
facts and circumstances to determine if the individual has enough con-
trol to be deemed an affiliate.
104
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

SOX gives the SEC the power to make exceptions to the independence
requirements; however, few exceptions are anticipated.
Figure in a financial expert
At least one person on a company’s audit committee should be a financial
expert. Generally, the SEC considers a person a financial expert if he or she
has, through education and experience, an understanding of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), financial statements, and internal
accounting controls.
The SEC doesn’t consider former CEOs to be financial experts.
SEC rules require that a public company disclose in periodic reports whether
any of its audit committee members are financial experts. If none are, the SEC
requires an explanation as to why not, and the audit committee is expected
to hire an outside consultant to provide the committee with the equivalent
expertise.
Day-to-Day Committee Responsibilities
NYSE and NASDAQ rules increase the audit committee’s authority beyond its
former role of simply recruiting and paying the company’s auditors. This sec-
tion summarizes the new role and responsibilities of internal audit commit-
tees under SOX.
Monitoring events and policing policies
The audit committee not only must be a corporation’s internal moral com-
pass but also must monitor external publicity and events that can impact the
audit process and make sure the company responds appropriately.
Under NYSE rules, the audit committee is responsible for reviewing and moni-
toring the following:
 The annual audited financial statements and quarterly reports filed by
the company
 Press releases and financial information provided to the public
 Policies for risk management within the company
 Problems that occur during an audit as well as management’s response
to such problems

 The role and performance of the company’s internal auditors
 Changes in company accounting policies
 Issues regarding internal controls and audit adjustments
 The policies and procedures of the committee itself
Interfacing with the auditors
The audit committee, in the broadest sense, is responsible for the appoint-
ment and compensation of the company’s outside audit firm.
Under SOX, the company’s audit firm must report directly to the audit com-
mittee. This arrangement is a departure from pre-SOX days, when auditors
also reported to management on a variety of issues. Congressional hearings
revealed an inherent conflict in the interaction between management and the
auditors who were, in effect, evaluating the effectiveness of management’s
policies.
The audit committee is expected to prevent management from influencing
audit outcomes. SOX specifically states that the committee’s role includes
the resolution of disagreements between management and outside auditors
regarding financial reporting. Therefore, the committee must have a full
understanding of both events that affect the company and the company’s
operations to properly understand and resolve these disputes.
Under SOX, auditors are required to report the following information directly
to the audit committee:
 All critical accounting policies and practices to be used
 All alternative treatments of financial information within Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles that have been discussed with manage-
ment, the ramifications of using alternative disclosures and treatments,
and the treatment preferred by the auditor
 Any other material or written communications between the auditor and
management, such as a management letter or schedule of unadjusted
differences
Additionally, under NYSE rules, the committee must obtain a report “at least
annually” from the independent auditors disclosing:
 The audit firm’s internal control procedures
 Any quality control issues raised about the audit firm by peer reviews
(which are reviews by other audit firms) or by government investigations
 All relationships between the independent auditors and the company
106
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Preapproving nonaudit services
The audit committee has sign-off authority for audit services, which means it
must authorize every accounting service the company’s audit firm provides,
including confirmation letters and compliance with the financial reporting
requirements of regulatory agencies.
In particular, the committee must make sure that the accounting firm per-
forming the company’s audit doesn’t perform any of the following nonaudit
services prohibited under SOX (Chapter 5 explains prohibited nonaudit ser-
vices in more detail):
 Bookkeeping or other services related to accounting records or financial
statements
 Financial information systems design and implementation
 Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-
kind reports
 Actuarial services
 Internal audit outsourcing services, management or human resources
functions
 Broker or dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services
 Legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit
If a nonaudit service isn’t on this list, it’s permitted provided that the audit
committee approves the service before the audit firm provides it.
With respect to services that aren’t specifically prohibited, SOX contains a
so-called de minimus exception. This exception applies when the services
provided aren’t significant; a service is considered de minimus if the total
amount of nonaudit services in a fiscal year doesn’t exceed 5 percent of the
total fees to the auditor. If the de minimus exception applies, preapproval
isn’t required, although the audit committee must approve the service prior
to completion of the audit.
A company is required to disclose all nonaudit services its auditors provide
in the statements it files with the SEC, including services deemed de min-
imus. The audit committee is responsible for making sure these disclosures
are made.
107
Chapter 7: The Almighty Audit Committee

Handling complaints
Every audit committee must have procedures in place for receiving and 
handling complaints about the company’s accounting, internal accounting
controls, or auditing matters, which include maintaining employees’ confi-
dentiality and allowing them to anonymously submit information they
uncover regarding questionable accounting or auditing actions taken by the
company.
The audit committee is responsible for maintaining policies about the dispo-
sition of complaints about the company. It’s also required to have procedures
in place for receiving confidential and anonymous complaints by employees.
The audit committee serves as a resource for employees, management, and
the auditors who put themselves on the line to provide essential audit infor-
mation. With the complaint function, the audit committee complements
SOX’s whistle-blower provisions, which I discuss in Chapter 16.
Receiving CEO and CFO certifications
Under SOX Section 301, every public company’s chief executive officer (CEO)
and chief financial officer (CFO) are required to certify in annual and quar-
terly reports that they have disclosed the following to the auditor and the
audit committee:
(1) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the company’s abil-
ity to record, process, summarize, and report financial data
(2) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls
The audit committee must make sure that any relevant information gleaned
from the certifications is brought to the attention of the audit firm. If appro-
priate, the audit committee may also be required to bring such information
directly to the attention of the SEC.
108
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Monitoring conflicts and 
cooling-off periods
The audit committee is expected to know which public accounting audit
firms are eligible to perform its company’s audits and which are not; the 
committee must be mindful of SOX’s provisions that auditors are barred from
performing any audit service if the company’s CEO, CFO, chief accounting
officer, controller, or any person serving in an equivalent position was
employed by the auditor and participated in any capacity in an audit of the
company during the one-year period preceding the commencement date of
the current audit.
Ferreting out improper influence
SOX Section 303 regulates the relationship between the audit committee, the
auditors, and management with a catch-all provision to discourage company
management from improperly influencing audits and auditors. This section
directs the SEC to adopt rules prohibiting officers and directors of public
companies or any person acting under the direction of an officer or director
from fraudulently influencing, coercing, manipulating, or misleading any out-
side auditor engaged in an audit for the purpose of making the audited finan-
cial statements misleading.
Rotating the audit partners
SOX requires public accounting firms to rotate the following individuals
every five years:
 The audit partner primarily responsible for a company’s audit
 The audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit
The audit committee is responsible for making sure this rotation actually
happens.
Engaging advisors
The audit committee may be involved in hiring more than just the auditors.
Under SOX, the committee also must have authority to engage independent
counsel and other advisors as it deems necessary to carry out its duties. The
law requires companies to provide their audit committees with appropriate
funding for hiring these advisors.
109
Chapter 7: The Almighty Audit Committee

Providing recognition in annual reports
SOX requires a complex communication matrix: Auditors report to the audit
committee, the committee reports to management, management reports back
to the committee, the committee reports to the securities exchanges, and
everyone reports to the SEC and the shareholders.
Because of this complicated communication trail, SOX requires that the names
of all audit committee members be identified in the company’s annual reports.
If the company doesn’t have a separately designated audit committee, it must
state that the entire board of directors is acting as the audit committee.
Audit Committee Rules
for Private Companies
Companies whose stock isn’t available for trade on a public exchange are
also affected by Section 301. SOX provides that these “over-the-counter”
traded companies must disclose in their proxy statements
 Whether they have an audit committee.
 Whether the members of the committee are independent under the rules
of the public stock exchanges.
Foreign Company Committee Issues
The NYSE and NASDAQ technically exempt foreign companies from their
audit committee requirements. However, SOX doesn’t include an exemption
from its audit committee requirements for non–U.S. companies, so if these
companies want to trade on U.S. markets, they have to convene committees
that comply with the requirements imposed by SOX as well as the NYSE and
NASDAQ listing requirements.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the function of the board of directors
 Recognizing the necessity of director independence
 Following procedures for placing directors on the board
 Delving into SOX’s requirements for boards
 Making exceptions to board governance rules
“B
oard governance” is a buzz phrase circulating throughout corporate
America in the wake of Enron, WorldCom, and other scandals.
Historically, the term has been used to refer to the policies and procedures
that a company’s board of directors uses to govern a corporation. However,
after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the meaning of the term has expanded to
include the selection process for directors and their duty to put the com-
pany’s interests above their own.
The most shocking aspect of the corporate scandals that seemed to engulf cor-
porate America after Enron was the behavior of the companies’ boards. The
media revealed that that boards governing the nation’s largest corporations
routinely strategized to overstate revenues, ignored auditors’ proposed adjust-
ments to financial statements, and sold stock during periods of plummeting
prices when company employees were prohibited from doing so. Some direc-
tors even made loans of corporate funds to themselves to finance their own
shaky side ventures. Prior to the passing of the SOX in 2002, these activities
were all business-as-usual in corporate America, leaving shareholders and
employees holding worthless stock and underfunded retirement plans.
This chapter explores how SOX makes boards more accountable. I provide
you with some general information about boards of directors and their func-
tions, and I touch on some examples of board governance gone bad.

Some Background about Boards
Every corporation is run by its board of directors, who in turn answer to the
shareholders that elect them. SOX ends an era of autonomy for board direc-
tors who, with the consent and consensus of the other board members, were
able to embark corporations on ruinous courses.
SOX contains the following provisions to make boards more accountable:
 Requiring “majority-independent” boards
 Changing how directors are nominated
 Regulating how compensation for directors and senior management
is set
What does a director do?
Directors manage corporate assets on behalf of the company’s shareholders.
A corporation’s bylaws generally establish the board of directors and specify
how many people will sit on it; typically, the number is no less than seven
and no more than ten, although there may be more or fewer directors
depending on the specific provisions of the bylaws.
The role of the board isn’t to manage the day-to-day operations of the corpo-
ration but rather to review the company’s long-term strategies and make crit-
ical decisions.
Typical tasks faced by a board of directors include
 Identifying the long-term goals of the company
 Hiring a chief executive officer (CEO) to run the company
 Receiving reports from the CEO as to the company’s doings
 Making decisions about mergers, acquisitions, and dispositions of cor-
porate assets
 Deciding what lines of business the company will continue
 Deciding whether to enter into new lines of business
 Directing reorganizations of the company structure, including issuing
new classes of stock
 Handling lawsuits and litigation
 Making major decisions about borrowing on behalf of the company

Looking at some bad, bad boards
Prior to SOX, boards governed companies; seldom did shareholders have
the opportunity to delve into their dealings. After Enron and other corporate
scandals, many misdirected directors found themselves in the media spot-
light. To really understand the kind of conduct SOX’s new board governance
is intended to preclude in the future, consider SOX’s provisions in light of the
following scandals:
113
Chapter 8: Building Boards That Can’t Be Bought
Off-balance sheet transactions after Enron
The term off-balance sheet has recently gotten
a bad rap because of Enron. However, not all
off-balance sheet transactions are shady. A
company can use off-balance sheet transac-
tions for a variety of legitimate purposes; there-
fore, it’s important to distinguish what was
off-color about Enron’s off-balance sheet trans-
action from what a legitimate off-balance sheet
transaction may be.
Essentially, Enron’s board of directors approved
deals for banks to loan funds to the special pur-
pose entities (SPEs) owned by chief financial
officer Andrew Fastow. A special purpose entity
is a company (a partnership or another corpo-
ration) formed to achieve a particular purpose
or accounting objective for the company.
Enron’s board did question Fastow’s apparent
conflict of interest. The loans to the SPEs
weren’t shown on Enron’s balance sheet
because, as the board knew, they were “non-
recourse” to Enron, meaning that Enron couldn’t
be sued if the SPEs defaulted on the debt. The
loans to the SPEs were collateralized by shares
of appreciating Enron stock. The deal unraveled
when Enron’s shares began declining in value.
Then, to placate the banks, Enron agreed to
guarantee the debt. However, because the
obligation was never reported to shareholders,
it made Enron’s publicly filed financial state-
ments fraudulent.
The following are examples of off-balance
sheet transactions that boards can legitimately
approve:
 Operating leases: Operating leases are
popular in industries that use expensive
equipment. The leases are disclosed in the
footnotes of the company’s published bal-
ance sheet because the company doesn’t
own the assets.
 Building leases: A company may enter into
an arrangement with a bank in which the
bank buys a building and leases it to the
company instead of the company borrow-
ing the money to purchase the building. A
building lease is a legitimate type of trans-
action that appears in the footnotes of the
company’s published balance sheet.
 Special assets: Many companies legiti-
mately create SPEs to segregate special
assets they use for collateral or other spe-
cial purposes from assets the companies
intend to keep and use in their businesses.
A board can approve many other types of legit-
imate off-balance sheet transactions in which
there’s no conflict of interest and no intent to
deceive shareholders. Still, investors must read
the footnotes on a balance sheet to identify
such transactions.

 Enron: In 2001, during what’s referred to as a blackout period, Enron
employees were prohibited from selling their stock for a period of time
while the company that administered their retirement plans was being
changed. (The average employee had about 62 percent of his or her
stock invested in Enron stock.) Ken Lay, Enron’s chairman of the board
during this period, enjoyed an exemption for board members that allowed
him to sell substantial amounts of his stock as the price plummeted
during the blackout from $13.81 to $9.98. Additionally, Enron’s board
approved the creation of several special purpose entities, which the com-
pany’s chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, owned. These entities were
used to hide corporate losses and get them off Enron’s balance sheet so
shareholders and employees remained unaware. These off-balance sheet
transactions were an important factor in Enron’s eventual downfall. (For
more on off-balance sheet transactions, see the sidebar “Off-balance
sheet transactions after Enron.”)
In what is perhaps one of the biggest understatements of the Enron era,
the Senate subcommittee investigating the Enron collapse concluded
that the Enron board of directors “failed to safeguard Enron sharehold-
ers and contributed to the collapse.” Congressional hearings detailed
numerous red flags waved in front of the directors and recounted how
they repeatedly ignored these warning signs. The subcommittee con-
cluded that the Enron board was hopelessly compromised because of
financial ties between the company and certain board members.
 Tyco: In 2002, it came to light that the CEO of Tyco International, Dennis
Kozlowski, had paid one director a $10-million fee and contributed $10
million to the director’s pet charity. Also, the Tyco board had approved
millions of dollars in questionable loans and bonuses to Kozlowski, who
was later convicted of conspiracy, securities fraud, falsifying records, and
stealing millions of dollars from the manufacturing and service company.
 Xerox: In 2002, Xerox settled a Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) civil fraud complaint relating to its accounting irregularities. As
part of the settlement, Xerox agreed to appoint a committee of outside
directors to review its accounting practices and policies.
 WorldCom: In 2002, WorldCom, the second largest long distance carrier in
the United States, filed bankruptcy after shocking shareholders with the
revelation that the company had overstated cash flows by more than $3.8
billion for the previous five quarters. It came to light that the board had
approved over $366 million in loans and loan guarantees to CEO Bernard
Ebbers to assist him in concealing losses as stock values declined.
 Global Crossing: In 2002, Global Crossing, one of the nation’s largest
telecommunications companies, declared bankruptcy amid allegations
that the board had sanctioned long-term strategic planning that involved
swapping unused fiber-optic capacity with other companies to generate
phantom revenues to boost the company’s shaky bottom line.

 Adelphia: In 2002, Adelphia Corporation, the world’s sixth largest cable
television operator, disclosed that it had loaned $2.3 billion to entities
controlled by the Rigas family, which founded and controlled Adelphia.
When the SEC began looking into these transactions, management came
up short on details. The transactions never showed up on the com-
pany’s balance sheet, so investors in Adelphia’s publicly traded stock
had no way of knowing about them.
In Search of Independent Directors
There’s a historical correlation between corporate fraud and boards of direc-
tors dominated by insiders. For example, the Senate subcommittee that
investigated Enron concluded that “independence of the Enron board of
directors was compromised by financial ties between the company and cer-
tain board members.” The subcommittee recommended that, first and fore-
most, Congress require the SEC and stock exchanges to “strengthen the
requirements for director independence at publicly traded companies.”
Under SOX, stricter board governance requirements are primarily imple-
mented by the listing requirements of stock exchanges such as the New York
Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations, better known as NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively. For example,
the rules of the NYSE now require that “[l]isted companies must have a major-
ity of independent directors.” Companies must also identify which directors
are independent and disclose the basis for making that determination.
To be considered independent, directors must meet all the criteria discussed
in this section.
No relationships with related companies
According to SOX, an independent director can’t serve “either directly or
indirectly as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a
relationship with the company.” This provision is intended to apply to the
company’s affiliates as well as the company itself; for example, the CEO of a
company wouldn’t be considered an independent director if he or she was an
officer of a subsidiary company.
Three-year look-back period
Both the NYSE and NASDAQ want to know what directors have done in the
three years prior to joining the board. Under the rules of both exchanges, a
director isn’t independent if he or a member of his immediate family has
115
Chapter 8: Building Boards That Can’t Be Bought

been an employee or executive officer of the listed company in the three
years prior to joining the board of directors.
Prohibited payments
Prior to SOX, many directors received large payments and bonuses that they
were unable to justify to the SEC and company shareholders. Criminal pro-
ceedings ensued in many cases, but irreversible damage was done to the
companies that directors had treated as their personal trust funds.
In response to the public outrage these large payments inspired, the NYSE
and NASDAQ have placed limits on the amount of compensation directors
can receive and still be considered independent:
 Under NYSE rules, a director isn’t independent if he or she has received
more than $100,000 in direct compensation from the listed company in
the last three years. An exception is made if the compensation is received
for serving as a director and on the company’s audit committee, which I
discuss in Chapter 7. The independent status of a director generally isn’t
impaired if he or she received a pension or other deferred compensation
because of past service.
 Under NASDAQ rules, a director isn’t independent if he or any family
member (as defined in the “Family ties” section) “accepted any pay-
ments from the company or any parent or subsidiary of the company
in excess of $60,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months
within the three years preceding the determination of independence.”
The NASDAQ rules contain exceptions for board or committee service,
compensation paid to family members in a nonexecutive capacity, and
benefits paid from retirement plans.
Family ties
Securities exchanges not only look at what directors themselves are doing
(or have done) to determine their independence, but also the directors’
immediate family members.
NYSE rules provide that a director isn’t independent if an immediate family
member is employed by the firm (or has been for the last three years) or
compensated in any manner that would be directly prohibited for a director.
(I discuss these requirements in the previous section.)

 Adult child or stepchild sharing a home with the director
NYSE rules provide that a director isn’t independent if an immediate family
member is employed by the firm (or has been within the last three years) or
compensated in any manner that would be directly prohibited for a director
(see the previous section for details).
When it comes to identifying a director’s family members, NASDAQ listing
requirements have a broader and therefore stricter definition than the NYSE:
 A spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether by blood, marriage, or 
adoption
 Anyone residing in such person’s home
Mandatory Meetings under SOX
NYSE rules contain a new requirement that distinguishes between board
members who are involved in the management of the company and those who
are not. The NYSE rules state that “[t]o empower non-management directors
to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management
directors of each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive
sessions without management.”
These meetings are intended to promote more open discussion about the
effectiveness of a company’s management. The company is required to
announce the non-management meetings to shareholders and other inter-
ested persons and to provide a way for them to communicate concerns they
want addressed at the non-management directors’ meetings.
Forming Committees for
Nominating Directors
The NYSE and NASDAQ take decidedly different approaches when it comes to
nominating directors. Although their nominating procedures differ slightly,
both exchanges specify publicly disclosed objective criteria for selection.
117
Chapter 8: Building Boards That Can’t Be Bought

NYSE nominating procedures
To fill positions on a company’s board of directors, the NYSE requires the
establishment of a nominating/corporate governance committee that’s run
pursuant to a written charter displayed on the company’s Web site. The
NYSE rules recommend that the charter address
 Qualifications of committee members
 How committee members are appointed to the committee and removed
from it
 How the committee operates
 The criteria used to select directors
 Policies for paying fees to executive search firms to select director can-
didates
The nominating/corporate governance committee is permitted to delegate
responsibilities to other committees so long as the other committees consist
of independent directors and also have written charters.
NASDAQ nominating rules
NASDAQ rules provide for director nominations either by a committee made
up of independent directors or by a majority of independent directors.
However, “[e]ach issuer must certify that it has adopted a formal written
charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the nominations
process and such related matters as may be required under securities laws.”
The NASDAQ rules include a special exception for a nonindependent director
to serve on a nominating committee if the board discloses in its proxy why
allowing the director in question to serve is in the best interests of the com-
pany. A nonindependent director serving on a nominating committee thanks
to this exception can’t serve more than two years.
Under NASDAQ rules, if a company uses a committee structure to nominate
director candidates, evaluation of a candidate can’t be delegated to a sub-
committee.
Regulating Director Compensation
Under NYSE rules, listed companies must have a compensation committee
composed entirely of independent directors to determine the compensation
for the entire board of directors and management. The compensation 
118
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

committee is required to post a written charter on the company’s Web site
that addresses how the committee goes about making recommendations to
the CEO and the board. The committee is also required to produce a “com-
pensation committee report on executive officer compensation as required
by the SEC to be included in the listed company’s annual proxy statement or
annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.”
NASDAQ allows compensation to be set either by a committee or a majority
of independent directors who make recommendations to the board. As with
the nominating committee, a special exception is made for a nonindependent
director to serve on the compensation committee (for up to two years) if the
board discloses in its proxy why allowing the director in question to serve is
in the best interests of the company.
Making governance guidelines public
Every corporation listed on the NYSE must post its corporate governance
guidelines on the company Web site. Governance guidelines need to be tai-
lored to reflect a particular company’s operations, but at a minimum, NYSE
rules require that the guidelines address the following:
 Director qualification standards, including procedures for training and
continuing education
 Responsibilities of directors, including obligations to attend meetings
 Policies for director access to management and independent advisors
 Procedures for determining director compensation
 Management succession policies
 A procedure for the board to conduct an annual self-evaluation (see the
following section)
NASDAQ rules don’t include any specific requirements for written board gov-
ernance guidelines. However, most NASDAQ-traded companies are likely to
adopt written guidelines.
A sample set of corporate governance guidelines appears in Appendix E.
Evaluating the board’s performance
According to the NYSE, an important component of board self-governance
is self-evaluation. However, the NYSE guidelines don’t specify how boards
must go about evaluating themselves. Many boards tackle the self-evaluation
requirement by giving board members a questionnaire that asks them to rate
119
Chapter 8: Building Boards That Can’t Be Bought

how well the board has performed its designated tasks. However, this
approach can have unintended consequences: If the board doesn’t address
problems disclosed by negative feedback on a questionnaire, a perception
may arise that the board isn’t diligent about fulfilling its responsibility. Thus,
the board may feel compelled to follow up on each less-than-perfect rating it
receives on the questionnaires.
If a company uses questionnaires for self-evaluation, the questionnaires must
be preserved because the company may be required to produce them in the
event of future litigation.
For most companies, a more practical approach to self-evaluation is to
hold regular meetings for purposes of board discussion and self-evaluation.
During such meetings, the board can determine what further action, if any,
is necessary as a result of the self-evaluation process. The issues raised in
meetings and details about how the issues were handled should be carefully
documented.
Some Exempt Boards . . . For the Moment
New board governance initiatives under SOX were primarily introduced
as amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which I discuss in
Chapter 3. The board governance standards are implemented by the require-
ments of the stock exchanges in which stock is publicly traded. Companies
that aren’t publicly traded, as discussed in this section, aren’t currently sub-
ject to SOX.
Nonpublic companies
Although nonpublic corporations aren’t currently subject to SOX, they are
accountable to their shareholders. Directors have a fiduciary duty to share-
holders, which means that they must govern with loyalty to the corporation
and not their own self-interest.
SOX ushers in new principles of independence and accountability that are
likely to impact the outcome of future lawsuits brought by shareholders who
claim that directors haven’t acted independently or otherwise in accordance
with their fiduciary duties. Accordingly, nonpublic companies are well advised
to voluntarily adopt governance standards (such as installing independent
board members and establishing audit committees) that reflect those man-
dated by SOX for public companies.
120
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Nonprofit corporations
Nonprofit corporations aren’t currently subject to SOX, but many are eager to
comply voluntarily. According to the annual Grant Thornton Board Governance
Survey for Not-for-Profit Organizations, 83 percent of nonprofits surveyed said
that they’re “very” or “somewhat” familiar with SOX.
Nonprofits can’t afford to allow a hint of scandal to taint their organizations,
and their boards of directors owe a fiduciary duty to the “stakeholders” in
their missions. Stakeholders may include organizations that award federal
grants, individual and corporate donors, and the intended recipients of ser-
vices provided by the nonprofit organization.
Other exempt companies
Both the NYSE and NASDAQ exempt certain types of companies whose
stocks trade on the exchanges from complying with SOX’s stringent board
independence and other governance requirements.
Under NYSE rules, the following types of companies are exempt:
 Companies in which an individual, group, or another company holds
more than 50 percent of the voting power
 Limited partnerships
 Companies involved in bankruptcy proceedings
NASDAQ exempts the following types of companies:
 Limited partnerships
 Issuers who have certain levels of assets to back the stock issuance
 Certain registered management investment companies

SOX: Under New Management
In This Chapter
 Looking at the duties of chief executive officers after SOX
 Singling out the SOX sections that impact management most
 Instituting subcertifications to ensure accountability
 Practicing practical internal control policy
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, requires managers to do more than just
manage; they must now personally sign off on an annual array of financial
reports and certifications.
Requiring management to stand behind the public disclosures that the
investing public relies upon isn’t a new concept. Prior to SOX, management
was required to sign off on a representation letter included in the company’s
annual report. However, the reporting and certification requirements under
SOX are more specific as to the representations required. SOX also imposes
criminal penalties for CEOs and CFOs that acquiesce to inaccurate reports.
In this chapter, you find a road map of CEO and CFO reporting and certifica-
tion requirements. It also includes some suggestions as to how managers can
comply with SOX requirements in an economically beneficial manner.
Chiefly Responsible: CEOs and CFOs
SOX seems to single out CEOs and CFOs when it comes to corporate ethics and
public accountability. Why? The answer lies in their overall job descriptions.

CEO: The chief in charge
The chief executive officer, or CEO, is the man or woman primarily responsible
(and with the most authority) for carrying out the company’s strategic plans
and policies as established by the board of directors. The CEO reports to the
board of directors and oversees the operations of the company. Because
pretty much every employee in the company (except the board members)
answers to the CEO, SOX obligates the CEO to take responsibility for maintain-
ing sound financial practices and good control within the company.
Some typical job responsibilities of a CEO include
 Keeping the board of directors informed: The CEO advises and informs
board members of the company’s day-to-day operations and progress
with respect to implementation of the board’s policies.
 Making sure the company produces profitable products and services:
Generally, the CEO oversees design, marketing, promotion, and quality
of the company’s products and services.
 Budgeting: The CEO makes budgetary recommendations to the board
and manages the company’s resources within the budget that the board
establishes.
 Managing tax and regulatory obligations: CEOs usually are responsible
for overseeing tax reporting policies and compliance with industry and
government regulations.
 Managing facilities and human resources: The CEO is responsible for
making recommendations to the board about company personnel and
company facilities policies; he or she also implements the policies 
established by the board in a way that conforms to current laws and 
regulations.
 Monitoring community and public relations: The CEO is generally
responsible for making sure that the company maintains a positive
public image and a high level of shareholder confidence.
CFO: The financial fact finder
Traditionally, the chief financial officer, or CFO, of a company is held account-
able for all the financial aspects of the company’s operations. He or she is
responsible for making sure shareholders, creditors, analysts, employees,
and management have accurate information about the company’s perfor-
mance. The CFO must make sure systems are in place to measure how well
the company is achieving its financial goals.
124
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Some of the CFO’s critical duties include
 Overseeing the forecasting and budgeting process
 Maintaining relationships with investment and commercial banks or
other sources of capital on which the company may be dependent
 Supervising control structures within the firm
Because the CFO exercises a great deal of authority over company finances
and personnel who carry out financial policy, it makes sense that SOX
requires him or her to sign off on reports and personally certify the com-
pany’s financial structures.
Three SOX sections for the chiefs
Thanks to SOX, life will never be the same for CEOs and CFOs. SOX contains
three separate sections that direct top executives to the two tasks they must
perform on a regular basis: certifying and reporting.
Sections 302 and 906 require the CEO and CFO to certify the accuracy of the
company’s financial statements. Section 404 (covered in detail in Chapters 11
and 12) further requires management officials to report on internal control
within their companies and include these reports in the annual and quarterly
reports filed with the SEC.
Section 302: Civil certifications
Section 302 requires the CEO and CFO of every publicly traded company to
certify the “appropriateness of the financial statements and disclosures con-
tained in the periodic report, and that those financial statements and disclo-
sures fairly present, in all material respects, the operations and financial
condition of the issuer.” The required contents and mechanics of certifica-
tions are discussed in more detail in the section “A Section 302 Certification
Checklist” later in this chapter.
Section 906: Criminal penalties
CEOs who willfully certify false financial statements are now subject to crimi-
nal penalties. SOX Section 906 adds a provision to the federal criminal code
requiring CEOs and CFOs to file additional annual and quarterly reports. This
certification is separate and somewhat redundant to the one required in
Section 302 (see the preceding section), but it’s mandatory. (Applicable
penalties are discussed in the section “Viewing Control as a Criminal Matter:
Section 906” later in this chapter.)
125
Chapter 9: SOX: Under New Management

Overlap with Section 404: Reports
In addition to the certifications described in Sections 302 and 906, SOX
Section 404 requires two types of management reports that attest to the accu-
racy of the financial statements. The reports are
 Statement of management’s responsibility: The 404 report must state
management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining an ade-
quate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 Assessment of internal control: Management must include its own
assessment of the company’s internal control structure and procedures
for financial reporting.
The attestations must follow the standards issued by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (covered in Chapter 6). For more on Section 404,
see the section “More Reporting Responsibilities for Management: Section
404” later in this chapter.
New frequent-filer requirements
SOX requires management to file Section 404 reports once a year, in the com-
pany’s annual report. However, the certifications mandated by Sections 302
and 906 must be filed both annually and quarterly. SEC rules require compa-
nies to perform quarterly evaluations of changes that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect their internal control
over financial reporting.
Companies may also be required to file extra reports between quarters,
namely an SEC Form 8-K, if important events affecting their internal control
structures occur. For example, an additional 8-K may be required if the com-
pany discontinues or outsources sensitive control activity previously done
in-house. (I discuss the 8-K form in more detail in Chapter 3.)
A Section 302 Certification Checklist
SOX Section 302 doesn’t leave CEOs and CFOs guessing about what their cer-
tifications must contain, nor does it give them much wiggle room. In fact, the
statute is structured to provide a checklist of what each certification must
contain. Each paragraph of Section 302 identifies a particular matter with
respect to the company’s annual or quarterly report to which management
must certify. This section discusses each of these Section 302 paragraphs; 
I include the text of a sample management certification in Appendix B.
126
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Paragraph 1: Review of periodic report
First and foremost, management must certify that it has actually read the
report in which the certification is being included. Paragraph 1 requires the
signing officer to certify that he or she has reviewed the report being certified.
Paragraph 2: Material accuracy
Paragraph 2 requires the signing officer to state that based on his or her
knowledge, the report doesn’t contain any material misstatements or materi-
ally misleading statements. The wording in this paragraph is similar to the
antifraud section of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10b-5).
(You can find out more about Section 10b-5 in Chapter 3.)
Paragraph 3: Fair presentation 
of financial information
Paragraph 3 requires management to state that based on the knowledge of
the signing officer, the financial statements and other financial information
contained in the annual report “fairly presents” in all material respects the
company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow for the
periods being reported.
The SEC clarifies that financial information includes any information from
which the financial performance of the company can reasonably be con-
strued, including footnotes, financial data included in the report, and discus-
sion and analysis of the financial information.
The SEC also has made clear that it intends, by this paragraph, to hold man-
agement to a more stringent standard than the company’s accountants. The
requirement that the report fairly present financial information isn’t limited
to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as discussed in Chap-
ter 5. Rather, management is held to a higher standard of material accuracy.
Paragraph 4: Disclosure controls and 
procedures
Paragraph 4 of Section 302 is divided into four subparagraphs: A, B, C, and D,
each of which imposes a particular duty upon management with respect to
evaluating the company’s internal control:
127
Chapter 9: SOX: Under New Management

 Paragraph 4(A) imposes responsibility on the signing officers “for estab-
lishing and maintaining internal controls.”
 Paragraph 4(B) addresses the design of the controls, directing manage-
ment to make sure controls are adequate to ensure that material, or sig-
nificant, information about the company comes to the attention of the
officers.
 Paragraph 4(C) imposes a time frame for testing, stating that the rele-
vant signing officers must certify they “have evaluated the effectiveness
of the issuer’s internal controls as of a date within 90 days prior to the
report.”
 Paragraph 4(D) requires management to take ownership of the conclu-
sions it has reached, requiring it to represent that it has reached its own
conclusions about the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls
based on an evaluation. This requirement implies that management is
directly responsible for the evaluation process and can’t delegate this
function.
The SEC recommends that management create a disclosure committee, which 
I explain later in this chapter in the section “Establish a disclosure commit-
tee,” to help it comply with Paragraphs 4(A) and (C).
In addition to the proper disclosure of information, the SEC expects manage-
ment to develop processes for reviewing and evaluating controls and proce-
dures. Management is also responsible for setting policies for supervising
people within the company who implement the internal control procedures.
Paragraph 5: Disclosure to auditors
Paragraph 5 relates to the disclosures that management must make to its
auditors and audit committee about the company’s internal control environ-
ment. Management must certify that the signing officers have disclosed the
following:
(A) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal con-
trols which could adversely affect the issuer’s ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the issuer’s
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the issuer’s internal 
controls
128
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Subparagraph 5(A) doesn’t define significant deficiencies, but SEC rules indi-
cate this phrase has the same meaning as under Generally Accepted Auditing
Standards (GAAS). GAAS standards state that a significant deficiency is a
material weakness that places the company at risk.
Paragraph 5 also doesn’t define the phrase involves management as it’s used
in connection with fraud under subparagraph (B). However, Congress
intended that it include a failure to supervise and detect fraud as well as an
active participation in these activities by management.
Paragraph 6: Changes in internal controls
Paragraph 6 requires management to provide information about any changes
in the company’s internal controls. The signing officers must certify that
they’ve indicated in the report, in which the certification is included, “whether
or not there were significant changes in internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficien-
cies and material weaknesses.”
Management must make sure that it errs on the side of disclosing factors that
happen in the company that can affect internal controls. The paragraph also
instructs management to let the public know about corrective actions that
could serve as a signal of ongoing problems to a wary investor. For example,
if management discovers discrepancies in reconciling accounts, it may be
required to disclose what actions it took to reconcile them.
Clearing Up Common Section 302
Questions
In passing Section 302, Congress was pretty specific about the content and
wording of the Section 302 certification (see the sidebar “Cutting and pasting
the Section 302 certification” for details). However, some aspects related to
whom, when, and how the filing requirements are actually applied can be
confusing. This section gives you the skinny on answers to these common
questions.
129
Chapter 9: SOX: Under New Management

What companies are required to file 
certifications under Section 302?
Section 302 certification requirements apply to all companies defined as
issuers under SOX. This label generally fits companies that file quarterly and
annual reports with the SEC under either Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (see Chapter 3). Specifically, issuers include
foreign companies, banks, savings associations, and small business issuers
covered by the 1934 Act.
What are the filing deadlines 
for Section 302?
Most companies, including most smaller public companies (known as nonac-
celerated filers), must comply with Section 404’s internal control over finan-
cial reporting requirements for their first fiscal years ending on or after 
July 15, 2007. (This is a one-year extension from the previously established
July 15, 2006 compliance date for nonaccelerated filers.) Section 302 certifica-
tions must currently accompany financial statements but may omit the
Section 404 language prior to the first year the company is required to
comply with that section.
130
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 
Cutting and pasting the Section 302 certification
The SEC provides a gift to managers every-
where in the form of a standard certification
form. CEOs and CFOs can use the form word-
for-word with only a few small changes:
 Switching from plural to singular officers:
The phrase “other certifying officers” in
paragraph 4 may be changed if a company
has two or fewer certifying officers.
 Adjusting for newly complying companies:
Until the first audit of a company’s books 
are performed, management can omit 
paragraph 4(B) pertaining to the officers’
responsibility for establishing and maintain-
ing internal control systems.
When using the standard certification form, the
CEO and CFO must sign separate but identical
certifications, and notarization isn’t required.
After they’re signed, the certifications must be
filed as exhibits to the report in which they’re
being included.
I provide a copy of the SEC’s general certifica-
tion form in Appendix B. 

Which reports get certified?
SOX requires CEOs and CFOs to certify liberally; most reports filed with the
SEC require management certification. The Section 302 and 906 certification
rules apply to
 Annual reports on Form 10-K
 Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
 Amendments to Form 10-K
Certifications don’t have to be included with Form 8-K, which is used to dis-
close significant corporate events between quarters. (I discuss the 8-K events
and reporting requirements in Chapter 3.)
Viewing Control as a Criminal Matter:
Section 906
According to SOX Section 906, lack of internal control can be a criminal
matter. Chief executive officers can end up in jail if they certify false financial
information in an SEC report.
Section 906 requires management to certify “that the periodic report contain-
ing the financial statements fully complies with the requirements of section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . . and that information
contained in the periodic report fairly presents, in all material respects, the
financial condition and results of operations” of the company.
Section 906(c) provides serious criminal penalties for failing to meet these
requirements, stating that whoever
. . . certifies any statement as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this sec-
tion knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does not
comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined not
more than $1,000,000, or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; or
willfully certifies any statement as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this
section knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does
not comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined
not more than $5,000,000, or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

Famous CEOs and CFOs behind bars
Prior to Enron, sentences for white-collar
crimes were minimal. Embezzling executives
were viewed as nonviolent and therefore
tended to get off more easily than a guy who
robbed a convenience store or a repeat
shoplifter.
During the big insider trading scandals of the
late 1980s, executives received their sentences
and were back on the golf course within a
matter of months. For example, famous fraud-
ster Ivan Boesky, who amassed a fortune by
trading on tips from corporate insiders, got a 10-
year sentence but served only 22 months.
Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed
on junk bond trader Michael Milken, who 
also served a mere 22 months of his 10-year
sentence.
In contrast, after Enron, judges have begun
handing out prison terms of 10 to 30 years they
intend to enforce in full. Recent sentences 
for high-profile CEOs and CFOs include the 
following:
 Adelphia Communications: Founder John
Rigas got 15 years and his son, Timothy,
landed a 20-year prison term after both
were ousted from the board of directors.
They were convicted on 18 counts each of
fraud and conspiracy after Adelphia, the
sixth largest cable company in the United
States, filed for bankruptcy. During the five-
month trial, prosecutors accused the
Rigases of conspiring to hide $2.3 billion in
corporate debt and stealing $100 million
from the company so they could invest in
golf courses and other personal assets.
 Dynergy: Jamie Olis, a former Dynergy
executive, is currently serving a sentence
of more than 24 years. Olis was found guilty
of securities fraud for a gas trading and
finance scheme dubbed Project Alpha. The
deal inflated Dynergy’s cash flow and cre-
ated bogus tax deductions that overstated
the company’s revenues to investors by as
much as $300 million. When the financials
had to be restated, the company’s stock
plummeted.
 Tyco: Following their convictions, Tyco CEO
Dennis Kozlowski and CFO Mark Swartz
received sentences of 81⁄3 to 25 years in
prison for misappropriating $600 million
from the manufacturing conglomerate.
 Enron: CFO Andrew Fastow received a 10-
year sentence after the Enron collapse.
Fastow personally profited from partner-
ships that were used to move debt off the
company’s books. This tactic caused a $1
billion loss, required Enron to restate $600
million in inflated profits, and cost bout 4,000
workers a job. The partnerships quickly
emerged as a leading cause of what was
then the largest bankruptcy-protection filing
in U.S. history. (As of this writing, it’s the
second largest, overtaken by WorldCom.)
Enron CEO Ken Lay’s trial is set for January
2006.
 WorldCom: Now known as MCI, WorldCom
remains the largest bankruptcy in history,
surpassing even Enron. Convicted on nine
counts of accounting fraud, CEO Bernard
Ebbers received 25 years behind bars for
his role in the company’s collapse.
Ironically, executives involved in these scan-
dals, including Ken Lay, the CEO of Enron, can’t
be charged with SOX-related crimes because
their misdeeds all took place before SOX was
passed. It’s an odd twist indeed that they can’t
be tried under the law they inspired. The rea-
sons these execs got such tough sentences has
to do with a 1987 change in federal sentencing
guidelines linking prison terms to the financial
losses caused by the crimes. (The 1987 law also
did away with parole.) As of this writing, Richard
Scrushy, the former CEO of HealthSouth, is the
only defendant to be prosecuted under SOX,
and he was exonerated. (You can read more
about the Scrushy trial in Chapter 16.)

Most of this section’s certification requirements are redundant with those
required under Section 302, so some experts think that including the require-
ment of a separate certification under Section 906 is an SEC oversight.
SOX Section 802 imposes additional criminal penalties for altering docu-
ments, including fines and prison time. See the sidebar “Famous CEOs and
CFOs behind bars” for details.
More Reporting Responsibilities 
for Management: Section 404
In addition to certifying several aspects of a company’s annual report, man-
agement is now required to prepare a key component of the report: Section
404 directs that management and auditors work in tandem to report and
assess the company’s internal control. This section of SOX assigns specific
responsibilities to each party.
What management has to do 
under Section 404
Under SOX Section 404, in a company’s annual report, management is respon-
sible for including an internal control report that
 States the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining
an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial
reporting
 Contains an assessment, as of the end of the company’s most recent
fiscal year, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and com-
pany procedures for financial reporting
Management has a lot of leeway in choosing what methods to use in fulfilling
its Section 404 responsibilities. This flexibility is appropriate considering the
management of a company is in the best position to identify control issues
and know where financial skeletons lie. Ultimately, management must be con-
fident in signing off on the effectiveness of its company’s internal control.
133
Chapter 9: SOX: Under New Management

What the auditors need from management
According to Section 404, the independent auditor is responsible for attesting
to and reporting on the assessment made by the management of the issuing
company. Before signing off on management’s internal control report, the
independent auditor must make sure management has
 Accepted responsibility for the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control
 Evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s internal control, using suit-
able criteria
 Supported its (the auditor’s) evaluation with sufficient documentation
 Presented a written assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control
The Benefits of Internal Control 
from a Management Perspective
CEOs and CFOs have traditionally had a wide range of responsibilities, first
and foremost of which has been making their companies profitable. And prior
to SOX, assessing internal control may have taken a back seat to activities
like developing a global marketing plan or seeking out competitive technolo-
gies. Consequently, many CEOs (and even some CFOs) need to get up to
speed on the concept of internal control and why it’s important to their com-
pany. To help you understand this reality, this section takes a look at some of
what both the accounting profession and the SEC have to say on the subject
of internal control.
Considering the auditor’s perspective
According to Generally Accepted Auditing Standard Number 60, a goal of
internal control is to “reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or
irregularities in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial
statements . . . may occur and not be detected within a timely period by
employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions.”
Under SOX, management is required to report on any significant “material
weakness” in the company’s internal control. Auditing Standard Number 60
states that significant weaknesses (as opposed to material ones) need not be
disclosed in management reports, but the aggregate effect of a number of sig-
nificant deficiencies may amount to a material weakness that does need to be
reported.

For more information about Generally Accepted Accounting Standards as
they pertain to SOX, turn to Chapter 4.
What the SEC says
SEC rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of finan-
cial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The SEC says inter-
nal controls must include policies and procedures that address
 Good recordkeeping: The maintenance of records that accurately, fairly,
and in reasonable detail reflect transactions and dispositions involving
company assets
 Recording and authorization of transactions: Reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as needed to permit preparation of finan-
cial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) and that the transactions themselves are authorized
by management
 Fraud detection: Reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company
assets
Management standards criteria 
for controls
Although management has a lot of leeway in deciding how to create and
enforce internal controls, the criteria it uses must be sensible and well recog-
nized. SEC rules stress that management’s evaluation and assessment of
internal control must be based on procedures developed by a recognized
nongovernmental organization. (The SEC has specifically endorsed the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s
Internal Control, An Integrated Framework — better known as the COSO frame-
work. I discuss the COSO framework standards in more detail in Chapter 13.)
At a minimum, management’s criteria must
 Be unbiased
 Permit consistent measurement of internal control over financial 
reporting
 Include all factors relevant to evaluating the effectiveness of the com-
pany’s internal controls
 Be relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
135
Chapter 9: SOX: Under New Management

Seeking Out Subcertifications
The SEC emphasizes that management must be actively involved in imple-
menting the internal control structures it approves and may not delegate its
responsibility for evaluating internal control to the independent auditors.
Nevertheless, in many companies, the CEO and CFO request that people
within the organization certify to them that internal control structures and
procedures are in working order.
Some of the employees and middle managers within an organization that may
have to provide such subcertifications include the following:
 Controller
 Corporate vice presidents and officers
 Risk management personnel
 Managers of information technology departments
CEOs and CFOs are understandably focused on attaining the highest degree
of confidence in financial-reporting documentation. It remains to be seen
whether the SEC hasn’t specifically sanctioned this trickle down accountabil-
ity approach, and regardless, the SEC is unlikely to shift any liability from
management. However, the advantages to the subcertification strategy are
clear:
 It puts employees on notice as to what management’s expectations are.
 It documents management’s expectations.
 It may increase the likelihood of compliance with existing internal con-
trol structures.
Some Good Advice for CEOs and CFOs
Most companies already have procedures in place and hold management
accountable for gathering and evaluating information to be included in their
financial statements, annual reports, and SEC filings. From this standpoint,
SOX doesn’t really require management or companies to do anything specific.
Rather, it directs CEOs and CFOs to take a greater role in these tasks and
assume more public responsibility for acting on procedures that safeguard
corporate assets.
136
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

No two companies have identical business operations, so SOX can’t give you
a “one-size-fits-all” solution for management. For example, it may not be
appropriate for all companies to establish a disclosure committee. The real-
ity is that each CEO and CFO must decide what methods of information gath-
ering and reporting constitute the best internal control for their organization.
This section covers three common-sense suggestions that can make the jobs
of CEOs and CFOs easier.
Establish a disclosure committee
The SEC suggests that companies consider establishing disclosure committees
to assist in developing disclosure controls and procedures. The disclosure
committee can consist of the company’s general counsel, the principal
accounting officer, the chief investor relations officer, risk managers, or other
people with control-related responsibilities in the company, such as informa-
tion technology or human resources personnel.
Take an inventory
The first task a disclosure committee may want to undertake (if the company
establishes one) is taking inventory of the company’s existing practices as
well as any known weaknesses. The committee should pay particular atten-
tion to any matters raised by the company’s independent auditors. This
inventory can help management document what policy breaches and mater-
ial weaknesses happened on their watch as opposed to that of a prior man-
agement team.
Woo the whistle-blowers
An important aspect of internal control that receives a lot of publicity is how
a company currently handles whistle-blower complaints. (I discuss whistle-
blower protections in more detail in Chapter 16.) Whistle-blowers are people
inside the company who provide information about breaches in internal con-
trol, material misstatements, and internal fraud to management or govern-
ment officials. Management should be familiar with audit committee
procedures for handling such complaints and can use the information
gleaned to fulfill its own reporting and certification responsibilities.

In This Chapter
 Creating a code of ethics
 Banning personal loans of corporate funds
 Shining a light on blackout trading
 Making “mis-managers” pay the penalty
 Guarding against audit interference
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, could aptly be renamed the Shareholder
Advocacy Act because its primary intent is to make sure that public cor-
porations are managed for the benefit of shareholders, even though corpo-
rate health is dependent upon management.
The post-Enron wave of corporate scandals revealed audited financial state-
ments that were fantasy sheets with phantom income on which huge manage-
ment bonuses were based. Shareholders were left holding the deflated stock
when massive accounting adjustments had to be made to reflect the com-
pany’s true earnings.
This chapter identifies some new tools ushered in by SOX for reigning in 
management.
Codifying the Corporate Conscience
SOX insists that corporations codify their consciences by requiring
 A written code of ethics
 Public disclosure of the code and changes to it
 Prompt reporting of any potential violations of the code

The Senate Banking Committee, which drafted many management oversight
provisions that were ultimately included in SOX, observed that the problems
surrounding Enron and other public companies primarily “raised concerns
about the ethical standard” of senior management. The report concluded
that “investors have a legitimate interest in knowing whether a public com-
pany holds its financial officers to certain ethical standards in their financial
dealings.”
This section takes a look at the practical aspects of requiring companies to
write up their ethical standards and communicate them to shareholders.
Explaining the code
SOX Section 406 requires companies to disclose in the periodic 10-K and 10-Q
reports they file with the SEC (discussed in Chapter 3) whether the company
has a written code of ethics for senior financial officers. If the company
hasn’t established a written code, an explanation is required.
If a company changes its code of ethics, it must promptly report the changes
to the public on the SEC Form 8-K, which the SEC requires for the reporting of
special events.
Establishing worthwhile objectives
The SEC Regulation S-K Item 406 explains that a code of ethics is a set of stan-
dards “reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing.” The regulation provides
that a written code of ethics should specify the following:
(1) Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;
(2) Full, fair, accurate and timely, and understandable disclosure in reports
and documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the [SEC] and in
other public communications made by the registrant;
(3) Compliance with the applicable government rules and regulations;
(4) The prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate
person or persons identified in the code; and
(5) Accountability and adherence to the code.
140
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Realizing one code doesn’t 
fit all companies
SEC rules provide that companies may have separate codes of ethics govern-
ing different types of officers. A company can create a broad code of ethics
with special provisions to address additional topics that apply to specific
persons within the company.
Disclosing amendments and waivers
SEC regulations require disclosure of any amendment or waiver of the provi-
sions of a company’s code of ethics. Amendments can be very telling about
corporate culture, particularly if they’re made in response to specific events.
For example, if a company suddenly implements standards for disclosing
off–balance sheet transactions, you may wonder if it has had a problem with
this issue in the past.
According to the regulations, the term waiver means the approval by the
company of “any material departure from a provision of the code of ethics.
SEC regulations state that this term includes implicit waivers, which refers to
the company’s failure to take action within a reasonable period of time after
management or the board of directors learns of a breach of the written provi-
sions of the code.
Expecting ethics on the exchanges
Stock exchanges, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ, require the companies trad-
ing on them to have written codes of ethics. Although the SEC, NYSE, and
NASDAQ requirements are similar in many respects, the following are a few
significant differences:
 SOX requires that the code of ethics apply only to senior financial offi-
cers. NYSE and NASDAQ rules require that a code be implemented to all
directors, officers, and employees.
 The SEC and NASDAQ require any waivers of code provisions to be dis-
closed on SEC Form 8-K (discussed in Chapter 3). The NYSE allows
waivers to be disclosed by other means, such as in letters to sharehold-
ers, press releases, or on the company’s Web site.
 SEC rules require disclosure of amendments to the code of ethics on a
Form 8-K, but neither the NYSE nor NASDAQ require the disclosure of
amendments.
141
Chapter 10: More Management Mandates

A checklist of code contents
Despite their differences (see the preceding section), it’s possible to draft a
single code of ethics that meets SEC, NYSE, and NASDAQ requirements.
At a minimum, your company’s code should do the following:
 State the objectives of the code, mirroring SEC Rule 406 (check out the
section “Establishing worthwhile objectives” earlier in this chapter)
 Identify the persons to which the code is applicable (for example, “all
directors, officers, and employees”)
 List contact people within the company who should be approached
when questions about the code of ethics arise
 Impose an obligation for candid and honest conduct
 Address how conflicts of interest should be identified and handled
 Establish policies for full disclosure and representation
 Identify the obligations of people who become aware of any violations of
the code of ethics, and lay out a protocol for notifying persons within
the company
 Establish that people subject to the code of ethics have, at all times, an
obligation to advance the company’s business interests before their own
 Impose confidentiality when it’s appropriate for achieving the objectives
of the code of ethics
 State that a duty of fair dealing exists at all times
 Impose on all people who are subject to the code a duty to protect and
safeguard the company’s assets for the benefit of the shareholders
A sample code of ethics is included in Appendix F.
New Rules for Stock Selling and Telling
Prior to SOX, a huge loophole existed for the sale of company stock back to
the company that issued it as opposed to selling it on the open market.
Federal securities laws required executive officers and directors to report
their ownership interests in the company on SEC Forms 3, 4, and 5. These
forms are commonly referred to as Section 16 reports because they’re
required under Sections 16(a) and b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Prior to SOX, the law stated that stock sales were generally reportable 10
days after the end of the month in which the transaction occurred. However,
sales of stock back to the company weren’t reportable until 45 days after the
end of the company’s fiscal year.
142
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

During its post-Enron hearings, Congress was outraged to learn of the follow-
ing pre-SOX executive antics:
 Early in 2001, Enron CEO Ken Lay sold substantial amounts of stock to
the company and wasn’t required to report the transaction until much
later. At that time, SEC Rule 16b-3 required only that a sale to the issuer
be reported annually on Form 5 rather than monthly on Form 4, the
requirement for sales of stock other than back to the issuing company.
 Tyco International Ltd.’s CEO and CFO sold more than $100 million of
Tyco stock to Tyco in late 2001, just before the company received exten-
sive coverage for corporate mismanagement. The CEO and CFO weren’t
required to report these sales under the SEC rules in effect at the time
because those rules provided that such sales were required to be
reported only on an annual basis.
 Global Crossing founder and chairman Gary Winnick reportedly received
$734 million for his stock before it plummeted into worthlessness in
January 2002.
These events prompted the Senate to lament that the law should have
required stock sales by executives to be brought to the public’s attention
“not a month or a year later when the damage has already been done.”
Because of the numerous crimes and scandals of the past, Section 16 of SOX
changes the preexisting requirement for stock-sale reporting by company
executives in several ways, which I cover in this section.
Faster disclosure
SEC rules require that stock sales by company executives be reported on SEC
Form 4 within two days of the “date of execution.” The revised rules also
require two-day reporting of certain transactions between employee benefit
plans by officers and directors and that transactions involving stock options
(such as grants, awards, cancellations, and repricings) be reported in the
same time frame.
More disclosure
SEC Forms 3, 4, and 5 have been amended to add columns that show the
exact dates that stock was purchased and sold. Under SOX, these forms must
be posted on the corporation’s Web site so everyone knows what manage-
ment and directors are up to when it comes to selling their stock.
143
Chapter 10: More Management Mandates

Owners of more than 10 percent of the common stock of any U.S. company
are required to file SEC Forms 3, 4, and 5, regardless of whether they’re offi-
cers or directors.
Prohibiting Personal Loans
SOX Section 402 prohibits SEC-registered public companies from making or
arranging loans to their directors and executive officers. Prior to SOX, this
practice was surprisingly commonplace; Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, Quest,
and Global Crossing had all authorized substantial personal loans to their
executive officers.
SOX distinguishes between personal loans and other extensions of credit.
Essentially, a loan isn’t considered a personal loan or arrangement for a loan if
the primary purpose is to advance the business of the company, even though
the loan may have the ancillary effect of enhancing the executive’s personal
credit. For example, some companies have employee benefit programs, such
as 401(k)s, under which loans are available on the same basis to all partici-
pants. Although the company may have arranged the loan provisions of the
benefits plan, the plan isn’t a prohibited loan arrangement under SOX.
SOX Section 402 contains a grandfather clause that exempts credit or loan
arrangements entered into between the company and its executives prior to
its date of enactment (July 30, 2002), so long as the extension of credit hasn’t
had any material modifications or renewals since its inception.
Banning Blackout Trading
No aspect of the Enron collapse captured more media attention than the infa-
mous management and director stock trades that took place during a black-
out period. From October 29 to November 12, 2001, Enron employees were
temporarily prohibited from selling the Enron stock in their 401(k) accounts
while the company administering the plan was changed. During this period,
the price of Enron stock dropped from $13.81 (right before the blackout) to
$9.98 (right after the blackout). Enron company executives, most notably
CEO Ken Lay, reportedly sold over $1 billion in Enron stock during the black-
out period, while employees lost nearly $1 billion from their retirement plans.
144
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

Avoiding media images of stricken retirees
During Enron’s collapse, the media seized upon images of devastated
retirees, and the effect was understandably heartbreaking and enraging. To
help reassure members of the public holding stock in their employers as
parts of retirement plans that their investments are secure and protected,
SOX includes the following points:
 Section 306(a) contains a general statutory prohibition on stock transac-
tions by directors and executive officers during blackout periods related
to employee benefit plans.
 The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is
amended to require the administrators of retirement plans to give all
plan participants at least 30-days notice before a blackout period is
imposed. The company faces a fine of $100 per day for each employee
who doesn’t receive such notice.
 ERISA further requires that the public be notified of any impending
blackout period; the company must file a Form 8-K within four days of
the date that notice of the blackout is provided.
Making some necessary exceptions
The requirements covered in the preceding section are subject to a few
notable exceptions. For the most part, these exceptions are intended to
strike a compromise between employees’ needs for information about black-
out periods and the added administrative burden of giving notice of routine
and anticipated blackout periods. The exceptions are:
 Neither ERISA nor SOX require notice of regularly scheduled blackout
periods that are disclosed in retirement plan documents distributed to
participants and beneficiaries.
 No notice is required for blackouts that must be imposed in connection
with mergers, acquisitions, and divestures.
Making Managers Pay Personally
In 2005, prior to being sentenced to 25 years in prison, WorldCom CEO Bernard
Ebbers agreed to pay $5.5 million in cash and turn over his mansion and $40
million in other assets to settle claims filed by WorldCom shareholders who
lost billions of dollars when WorldCom collapsed in the largest bankruptcy in
145
Chapter 10: More Management Mandates

history. Prior to the deal, Ebbers had repaid only a small portion of the $408
million in personal loans WorldCom made to him before the board forced him
to resign.
SOX now makes it much more difficult for managers to appropriate corporate
assets. New laws permit their personal assets to be frozen or recovered
under a wide range of circumstances.
The freeze factor
SOX Section 1103 authorizes the SEC to freeze the paychecks of “directors,
officers, partners, controlling persons, agents, or employees” that it targets
“during the course of a lawful investigation involving possible violations of
federal securities laws.” The way this deep freeze works is that the SEC
requests a federal court to issue a temporary order placing the payments ear-
marked for these individuals in an interest-bearing escrow account.
The court order is effective for 45 days, during which time the SEC decides
whether to file charges against the individuals in question. If the SEC doesn’t
bring charges and can’t convince the court that it has good cause to freeze
the assets for another 45 days, the funds are paid out to the individuals who
were slated to receive them. In any event, the SEC can’t freeze the assets for
more than 90 days without bringing charges. If it does bring charges, the
freeze remains in effect “until the conclusion of any legal proceedings related
thereto.”
The danger of disgorgement
Many CEOs and corporate executives are given bonuses and compensation
based on the performance of their companies. But what at first blush may
seem like a straightforward, merit-based compensation arrangement can
become enormously complicated and terribly unfair when the corporate
earnings on which the bonuses are based have to be adjusted downward. For
this reason, SOX provides that bonuses based on previous (erroneous) earn-
ings also have to be repaid when the restatement is attributable to manage-
ment’s noncompliance.
Under SOX, CEOs must give back their bonuses if the company’s financial
statements have to be restated due to “material noncompliance” with finan-
cial reporting requirements. Specifically, CEOs and CFOs have to give back
146
Part II: SOX in the City: Meeting New Standards 

 Any incentive-based compensation paid during the 12-month period fol-
lowing the initial publication of the financial statements
 Any equity in the company received as compensation during the 12-
month period following the initial publication of the financial statements
 Profits from the sale of the company’s securities
Stopping Audit Inference
In 2001, Enron was forced to report that it was required to correct (or restate)
its 1997 earnings by $96 million, 1998 earnings by $113 million, 1999 earnings
by $250 million, and 2000 earnings by $132 million. During investigations,
Congress and the public were outraged to learn that its accounting firm,
Arthur Anderson, had been pressing for the adjustments for years but had
capitulated when management stood firm in refusing to make them.
As a result of this and other events, SOX Section 303 provides that it shall be
“unlawful” for any officer or director of an issuer or any other person acting
under his or her direction to take any action to fraudulently influence,
coerce, manipulate, or mislead any independent public or certified public
accountant performing the audit of the issuer’s financial statements.
Identifying audit interlopers
SEC rules make it clear that very little leeway is given to managers and direc-
tors who attempt to influence the outcome of their company’s audits. The fol-
lowing activities aren’t tolerated:
 Attempting to convince the auditors to issue financial statements that
aren’t in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP; see Chapter 4)
 Attempting to skip or overlook parts of an audit
 Failing to communicate required matters to the company’s audit 
committee
 Threatening to cancel audit engagements or fire auditors (including
undertaking more obvious forms of blackmail threats and intimidation)
 Knowingly providing false, misleading, or incomplete information to
auditors
147
Chapter 10: More Management Mandates

Suing audit interlopers
In the aftermath of SOX, if a company was to shred documents, encourage
employees to mislead auditors, or skew audit test results, it would find itself
defending against a lawsuit by the SEC under a new provision of SOX that
specifically authorizes such litigation.
SOX Section 303 and the accompanying SEC Rule 13b2-2 enable the SEC to file
civil lawsuits against individuals and public companies that interfere with
audits.
Under Section 303, the SEC can make more specific rules to prevent audit
interference. Rule 303(b) also provides that in “any civil proceeding,” the SEC
“shall have the exclusive authority to enforce this section and any rule or reg-
ulation issued under this section.” This SEC authority means that private
individuals usually don’t have the right to sue companies for audit interfer-
ence; they have to wait for the SEC to do so. Similarly, Rule 303(c) states that
the anti-interference provisions are enacted “in addition to” and don’t super-
sede any other provisions of the law or rules or regulations that may prohibit
the same conduct.

T

B
efore the Securities Act of 1933 was passed, President Roosevelt publicly
agreed with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandies that “sunshine is said
to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.” Like
the 1933 Act, SOX attempts to shine a bright light on financial reporting impro-
prieties within corporations by zeroing in on “disclosure controls and proce-
dures” and “internal control over financial reporting.” However, in doing so,
Congress and the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, have also created
the inevitable uncertainty that accompanies any new legislation.
This chapter attempts to clarify the concepts of “disclosure controls” and
“internal controls” introduced by SOX Sections 302 and 404. It also looks at
the costs, dates, criteria, and other threshold issues associated with comply-
ing with these sections. I also explain why the term “internal control” has dif-
ferent definitions depending on whether it is used in connection with Section
302 or Section 404.

The Nuts and Bolts of Section 404
Congress included some broad new standards in SOX Section 404, deliber-
ately did not tell companies how to implement them. The section is deliber-
ately short on specifics. Instead, Congress directs the SEC and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, to create more specific
rules for companies to follow under SOX. (For more on the PCAOB, turn to
Chapter 6.)
What Section 404 says
Section 404 may be only 180 words, but since Section 404 was first intro-
duced, U.S. companies have been busy interpreting every turn of phrase in
order to figure out exactly what they must do to comply with the statute.
Examining the wording of Section 404 can help you understand the obliga-
tions imposed under the SEC and PCAOB rules, which interpret Section 404
and more specifically define companies’ obligations.
The following comes directly from Section 404. I’ve underlined buzzwords
and key phrases for you to pay particular attention to:
SEC. 404. MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.
(a) RULES REQUIRED.—The Commission shall prescribe rules requiring
each annual report required by section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) to contain an internal con-
trol report, which shall—
(1) state the responsibility of management for establishing and
maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for
financial reporting; and
(2) contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal
year of the issuer, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure
and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting.
(b) INTERNAL CONTROL EVALUATION AND REPORTING.—With respect
to the internal control assessment required by subsection (a), each regis-
tered public accounting firm that prepares or issues the audit report for
the issuer shall attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the
management of the issuer. An attestation made under this subsection
shall be made in accordance with standards for attestation engagements
issued or adopted by the Board. Any such attestation shall not be the
subject of a separate engagement.

Part III: Surviving Section 404 

What Section 404 really does
The concept of internal control really isn’t anything new; many companies
had excellent controls and procedures in place prior to SOX. But SOX Section
404 accomplishes three objectives:
 Clarify what’s required for a company to maintain adequate internal 
control
 Require management and auditors to formally certify that adequate
internal controls are in place
 Specify roles of the SEC and PCAOB in carrying out the objectives of SOX
SEC Rules Under Section 404
In carrying out its mandate to prescribe specific rules for implementing
Section 404, the SEC has focused on two critical areas:
 Management responsibility: Annual reports required to be filed with the
SEC must state management’s responsibility for establishing and main-
taining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for finan-
cial reporting.
 Effectiveness of internal control: An annual report must contain an
assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control struc-
ture and procedures for financial reporting as of the end of the com-
pany’s most recent fiscal year.
PCAOB participation in the 
Section 404 process
SOX 404 requires the PCAOB to create standards specifically for auditors in
complying with Section 404. Auditors are responsible, under the Section, for
attesting to and reporting on the assessment made by management. They
must do so in accordance with standards for attestation engagements
adopted by the PCAOB. (The role and duties of the PCOAB in regulating the
audit profession are discussed in Chapter 6.)
Audit Standard No. 2 is intended to guide audit firms in complying with
Section 404. You can download a copy of Standard No. 2 and the accompany-
ing information release at the PCAOB Standards Web site located at www.
pcaobus.org/Standards/index.asp, under the link indicated in Fig-
ure 11-1.

Chapter 11: Clearing Up Confusion About Control

When Do Companies Have to Comply
with Section 404?
Most companies have until fiscal years “ending on or after” July 15, 2007, to
comply with SOX’s internal control reporting and disclosure requirements.
Large companies have 60 days after the close of the fiscal year to file their
Form 10-k (containing audited financial statements with the SEC). Smaller
companies with revenues of less than $75 million in equity (generally its
voting and non-voting stock) have 90 days after the close of the fiscal year to
file their financial statements.
Since many companies are on a calendar-year fiscal-year basis, their date for
404 compliance will be December 31, 2007. However, many companies use a
June 30 or other date for the end of their fiscal year, and they have a longer or
shorter period to comply. For example, a company with a June 30 fiscal year
would have to comply with Section 404 for its June 30, 2008 fiscal year end.

As of the writing of the book, the SEC is also considering liberalizing the
Section 404 requirements that apply to quarterly and other SEC reports filed
during the year. It is also considering liberalizing the requirements to allow
more companies to qualify as nonaccelerated, possibly exempting companies
with equity of as much as $125 million from having to obtain  an independent
Section 404 audit. For more discussion which companies are currently
required to do what, see the sidebar “Accelerated and nonaccelerated filers.”
A “fiscal” year is a year measured for financial reporting purposes, and can
end on a date other than December 31, which is the year end date for a calen-
dar year.
Many companies are on a calendar year ending December 31, so their first
date for 404 compliance is December 31, 2007, because that is their first fiscal
year “on or after July 15, 2007.” Another popular date used by companies to
end their fiscal year is June 30. These companies would have comply with
SOX Section 404 beginning with the June 30, 2008, annual reports.

Accelerated and nonaccelerated filers
If a company is considered an accelerated filer,
it has a much longer time frame to comply with
SOX than a company that is deemed an accel-
erated filer under SEC rules.
If a company is an accelerated filer, it first
meets the following four conditions at the end
of its fiscal year:
 The market value of the voting and non-
voting common equity (stock) of the com-
pany is $75 million or more.
 The company has been subject to the
reporting requirements of requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
of 1934 (discussed in Chapter 2) for a period
of at least 12 calendar months.
 The company has filed at least one annual
report under Section 13(a) or 15(d).
 The issuer is not eligible to use certain spe-
cial SEC Forms for small businesses.
If a company does not meet the criteria above,
it is deemed a nonaccelerated filer and is sub-
ject to the recently extended July 15, 2007, com-
pliance date.

Section 302 “Internal Control” versus
Section 404 “Internal Control”
One of the biggest sources of confusion under SOX is the term “internal con-
trol.” It certainly doesn’t help that the SEC decided to use the term “internal
control” in two different sections of SOX and provide a different meaning for
the term under each section.
By using different definitions, the SEC intended to make clear that SOX is
aimed at two distinct types of internal controls. Under Section 302, the term
internal control means disclosure controls and procedures. Under Section 404,
the term means internal control over financial reporting.
This section attempts to clarify what are considered “disclosure controls and
procedures” under SOX Section 302 and what is considered “internal control
over financial reporting” under SOX Section 404.
Defining “disclosure controls and 
procedures” under Section 302
Section 302 of SOX requires each CEO and CFO of a public company to certify
that they have designed “internal controls” sufficient to ensure that they
know about material information within the company. The certification
applies to the period for which each SEC periodic report was prepared
(Section 302 is discussed more fully in Chapter 9). The SEC has said that, for
purposes of Section 302, references to internal controls mean “disclosure
controls and procedures.” The SEC has explained disclosure controls and
procedures encompass all the controls and procedures a company uses to
ensure that information in the 10-K annual reports and 10-Q reports they file
with the SEC is accurate.
The scope of the term “disclosure controls and procedures” is broader than
the term “internal control over financial reporting.” Disclosure controls and
procedures includes controls over all information that impacts company
resources, not just controls on accounting and financial information.
In addition to complying with the certification requirements discussed in
Section 302 to avoid civil liability, management must submit an additional
certification containing similar information under Section 906. (I discuss both
types of certifications further in Chapter 9.)
156
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

Section 302 requirements at the end of every period
SEC rules require management to
 Evaluate a company’s disclosure controls and procedure as of the end of
each period covered by the particular report.
 Make conclusions about the effectiveness of the controls and proce-
dures the company has in place.
To comply, most companies begin preliminary testing of internal controls and
procedures early in the year being reported and do final testing at the end of
the year to make sure management and auditors have submitted a report that
is valid as of the end of the year, as required by Section 404.
Minimum Section 302 standards for every company
Disclosure controls and procedures vary according to the industries in which
companies operate and the companies’ unique corporate structures.
However, in every company, certain basic structures need to be present in
order for management to prepare its report and for the auditors to indicate
that management’s report is accurate.
At a minimum, a public company must have the following in place with
respect to its disclosure controls and procedures:
 Written procedures: A company’s internal controls and procedures
should be written out in enough detail to provide guidance but not in so
much detail that they’re burdensome and difficult to follow.
Disclosure controls and procedures requiring excessive detail can make
the processes rigid and inflexible and create unnecessary compliance
issues.
 Systematic management supervision: Management should be formally
involved in supervising internal controls and procedures at a practical
level. Companies should put into place a calendar for monitoring con-
trols and procedures and identify milestone dates. Additionally, the SEC
recommends they form special disclosure committees, as discussed in
Chapter 9.
 A process for reviewing effectiveness: Internal controls and procedures
for U.S. companies should be evaluated on a quarterly basis in order to
ensure they continue to be effective.
157
Chapter 11: Clearing Up Confusion About Control

Interpreting “internal control over financial
reporting” under Section 404
Under SOX Section 404, all public companies are required to include in their
annual reports a report of management on the company’s “internal control
over financial reporting.” The SEC rules describe a control over financial
reporting as a process designed “to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial state-
ments for external purposes.”
This phrase “internal control” as it is used in Section 404 refers to the types
of controls a company must have in place in order to prepare its financial
statements according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
which I explain in Chapter 5. Because this term relates only to GAAP, it’s nar-
rower in scope than the broader term “disclosure controls and procedures”
language used in Section 302, discussed in the preceding section.
Key elements of an internal control over financial reporting
The SEC rules require that an internal control over financial reporting satisfy
three key functions:
 Recordkeeping: The process must involve maintaining records that
accurately, fairly, and in reasonable detail reflect transactions and dispo-
sitions involving the company’s assets.
 Compliance: The process must provide reasonable assurance that trans-
actions are actually recorded so as to ensure that receipts and expendi-
tures are made only when authorized by management and are recorded
so that financial statements can be prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 Prevention and detection: The process must provide reasonable assur-
ance that unauthorized use or disposition of company assets can and
will be detected.
U.S. securities laws have required companies to maintain internal controls
since 1977. SOX merely requires management and auditors to formally report
on what should already be in place.
Management’s evaluation responsibilities under Section 404
Section 404 provides that management’s report must establish its responsi-
bilities for maintaining adequate internal accounting controls. The SEC rules
warn companies that “inquiry alone will not provide an adequate basis for
management’s assessment,” So management’s procedures for testing internal
controls must include both:
 Evaluation of the control’s design
 Testing of the control’s effectiveness
158
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

In the company’s annual report filed with the SEC, management must include
its own report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting. In
addition, the public accounting firm that audits the company’s financial state-
ments (the ones that appear in the annual report) must issue an attestation
report on management’s assessment of internal control; this report gets filed
as part of the company’s annual report. With respect to quarterly reports,
management is required to evaluate any change in the company’s internal
control occurring during a fiscal quarter that materially affects or is reason-
ably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control.
What evaluation criteria should management use under Section 404?
Management is required to base its assessment of the effectiveness of the com-
pany’s internal control over financial reporting on a suitable on a set of stan-
dards established by recognized experts. The SEC specifically refers to the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission
as an acceptable framework for management’s internal control assessment.
The COSO criteria is covered in more detail in Chapter 13, and is the only set of
standards specifically recognized by the SEC as of the writing of this book.
The directives in PCAOB’s Auditing Standard No. 2 are based on the frame-
work established by COSO. This is because so many public companies are
expected to use that framework for their assessments. Other SEC-sanctioned
approaches and frameworks may be published in the future; although differ-
ent frameworks may not contain exactly the same elements as COSO, they
probably incorporate most of the same testing concepts and criteria.
The AICPA offers several resources to assist in understanding and complying
with the COSO framework, including checklists for internal control testing.
You can find these resources at www.cpa2biz.com.
Controlling the Cost of Compliance
Research shows public companies have had to dig deeply into their pockets
to comply with SOX. In fact, a survey by Financial Executives International
(FEI), the leading professional organization of chief financial officers (CFOs)
and other senior financial executives, concluded that in the first year of
SOX’s enactment, Section 404 cost U.S. companies $3.14 million per company.
Much of this initial expense is attributed to costs for consulting, software,
and the 58 percent increase in the fees charged by external auditors. (For full
coverage of the costs associated with Section 404, check out Chapter 13.)
Although Congress was in a hurry to pass SOX in 2002 as a political response
to the Enron crisis, it wasn’t totally insensitive to costs of compliance.
Section 404(b) provides that the auditor’s attestation of management’s
assessment of internal control shall not be the subject of a separate engage-
ment. In other words, Congress carefully conveys its expectation that compa-
nies not be forced to pay for duplicative audit services.
159
Chapter 11: Clearing Up Confusion About Control

Cost-cutting measures by the PCAOB
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which oversees
all audit firms, has attempted to make compliance as economical as possible.
In an effort to reign in audit costs, the PCAOB has issued Auditing Standard
No. 2. Under this standard, the audit firm must:
 Address the requirements for internal control over financial reporting
 Review management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the internal
control
Standard No. 2 also directs audit firms to perform two tasks required under
Section 404 during a single audit engagement, rather than conducting two
separate audits (and billing the to do both). This is because the work the
objectives and the work involved in performing both audits make them inter-
related. For example, the auditor’s discovery of misstatements in the finan-
cial statements may indicate the existence of weaknesses in the company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
In addition to issuing Auditing Standard No. 2, the PCAOB has also specially
studied the impact Section 404 costs have on companies, particularly small
and medium-sized companies. The PCAOB anticipates that most companies
regardless of size experience the highest cost of compliance with Section 404
during the first year they’re required to comply with the law. 
The PCAOB has determined that cost of complying with Section 404 is related
to factors such as:
 The adequacy of the company’s internal controls in previous years:
Existing control systems, ethical standards, and core values of a senior
management group all help determine the costs of compliance with
Section 404 and related SEC rules.
 Whether the company does business overseas: Large, complex, multi-
national companies, for example, are likely to need more extensive and
sophisticated internal control systems.
 The complexity of the company’s corporate structure: Companies with
multiple subsidiaries and related entities may have increased costs of
compliance simply because they have more information and locations to
track. In contrast, smaller companies and companies with less complex
operations may find that compliance is less burdensome than originally
anticipated.
Finally, the PCAOB has recognized that audit costs may be impacted by how
much the auditor is permitted to rely on the work of internal auditors (which
are paid at company salaries rather than expensive hourly rates as the auditors
are). Accordingly, PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2 provides outside auditors
160
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

lots of discretion and flexibility in using the client company’s personnel. The
standard does, however, require the audit firm to obtain (through its own
auditing procedures) a meaningful portion of the evidence that supports its
opinion.
Section 404 sticker shock
A major criticism of SOX has been the huge, unexpected first-year costs of
complying with Section 404. These costs are the primary reason the SEC
cited for pushing back compliance deadlines for smaller companies to give
them an extra year (see the section “When Do Companies Have to Comply
with Section 404?” earlier in the chapter).
Decreasing costs in year two
When companies were asked about their anticipated costs in complying with
SOX in year two, “85 percent of respondents said they expect nonauditor
expenditures to decrease (by an average of 39 percent), and 68 percent said
they believe the costs of their primary auditor will also decrease (by an aver-
age of 25 percent),” according to a recent study done by Financial Executives
International (FEI).
161
Chapter 11: Clearing Up Confusion About Control
An SEC commissioner’s reflections 
on Section 404 costs
In a September 2005 speech before the
Association of State Treasurers, summarized in
Compliance Week Magazine, SEC Commissioner
Paul Atkins blasted the SEC for its poor esti-
mates on the costs of complying with SOX.
Atkins charged “Perhaps nothing in recent
memory has illustrated the need to perform
more probing cost/benefit analysis before
requirements take effect than the regulatory
regime that has grown under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.” He concluded, “As we
enter the second year of the 404 process . . . it is
becoming increasingly evident that everyone
greatly underestimated the costs.”
To support this criticism, Atkins several com-
pelling statistics. He explained “When the SEC
first released its implementation rules for
Section 404, we estimated aggregate costs of
about $1.24 billion or $94,000 per public com-
pany.” He lamented “Unfortunately our esti-
mates were not just low, they were incredibly
low. Surveys have indicated that actual costs
incurred for 404 compliance were 20 times
higher than what we estimated.”
Atkins also warned that year-two compliance
costs will not decrease significantly. He pre-
dicted “Cost reductions from year one will
instead be in the neighborhood of 5 to 20 per-
cent, and I predict that the reduction will be at
the low end of this range.”

A great way to keep up with what other companies are doing with respect to
SOX is to become a member of Financial Executives International. FEI is the
“leading advocate for the views of corporate financial management.” The
organization has more than 15,400 members who hold policymaking posi-
tions as chief financial officers, treasurers, and controllers. The organiza-
tion’s Web site is located at www.fei.com.
162
Part III: Surviving Section 404 
Looking for the sunny side of Section 404
Most businesses (and many politicians) are
unhappy with SOX simply because the costs of
compliance been so much greater than origi-
nally expected. These costs have been viewed
as a drain on productivity that puts American
businesses at a disadvantage with foreign 
competitors.
Section 404 is the provision of SOX that busi-
nesses complain about most. However, SOX
proponents argue there will be less grumbling
about Section 404 as businesses move beyond
the first year of compliance, when the costs are
the highest. After the first year, businesses 
may also notice benefits from Section 404 audits
and increased internal control, such as elimina-
tion of fraud and redundancies in internal
processes. Companies that have always oper-
ated in an ethical, above-board manner consis-
tent with Section 404 may actually enjoy a
competitive advantage. These squeaky-clean
companies will have an easier time complying
with Section 404 and will ultimately have to ded-
icate less money for compliance than compa-
nies that need to substantially scramble and
revamp their internal processes in order to get
a clean Section 404 opinion from their auditors.
A benefit on the horizon for businesses and
investors alike is the increased reliability of
financial information and reporting. This is what
SOX was passed to accomplish, and it appears
that the law is working. According to Financial
Executives International (FEI), “55 percent of
companies surveyed believe Section 404 gives
investors and other external audiences more
confidence in a company’s financial reports,
and 83 percent of large companies (over $25 bil-
lion) agree. Significantly, however, 94 percent of
all respondents said the costs of compliance
exceed the benefits.”
Other critics of SOX argue that it has failed to
alter the behaviors of boards and management
in measurable ways and that this behavior is
what ultimately determines the control environ-
ment. According to Linda Mertz of Mertz
Associates, Inc., a company that specializes in
mergers and acquisitions, “SOX has added
complexity and cost to a company’s economic
equation, but has yet to demonstrate the addi-
tion of economic value or any measurable
change in management’s behavior or attitudes.”
However, changes in board and management
“behavior” with respect to internal control may
be difficult to measure. How do you measure
the costs of lawsuits, frauds, and misstatements
of financial information that are avoided?
It’s difficult to deny that more qualified, respon-
sible board directors contribute to building
better companies. SOX has undeniably raised
the bar for board membership (as discussed in
Chapter 8), but there is little data on how it has
impacted the behavior of board members
already ensconced in their positions.

According to FEI, companies believe they can reduce their SOX compliance
costs after the first year by:
 Focusing on risk areas in the audit
 Reducing the degree of documentation required in general
 Being more flexible in remediating control problems uncovered by the
Section 404 audit

S
OX Section 404 makes it the responsibility of management to assess the
company’s internal control for financial reporting at the end of each year.
Unfortunately, Section 404 and the SEC rules passed to interpret it don’t spell
out exactly what internal control means in all scenarios. Reportedly, this omis-
sion has led to extreme scenarios in which auditors insist upon verifying that
all restroom keys are accounted for or testing obscure computer code config-
urations that are unlikely to impact the company’s financial statements.
This chapter examines the expanded the role of the audit firm and helps
CFOs, compliance officers, and audit committees identify where they can
draw the line in a 404 audit.
Dividing Up Responsibilities 
in a Section 404 Audit
An audit of internal control is, as you might expect, a very controlled
process. The 404 audit is a major project to which a company devotes sub-
stantial manpower and financial resources to complete. The audit process
involves structured communication between management, independent audi-
tors, the company’s audit committee, and, on occasion, its board of directors.
In a 404 audit, everyone has a specific role to play.

Management’s role
Shifting focus from the pursuit of profits to the internal controls within a
company is a difficult transition for many managers. Most are still adjusting
to their new SOX-related responsibilities.
The major responsibilities of management with respect to the 404 audit are:
 Learning about the system of internal control that’s in place
 Evaluating the effectiveness of both the design and implementation of
internal control structures
 Preparing a written assessment at the end of the year on the effective-
ness of internal control to include in management’s report
The independent auditor’s role
A Section 404 audit is part of the annual audit of a company’s financial 
statements — it’s not a separate process. As part of the overall audit, Section
404 requires the independent audit firm to express an opinion on manage-
ment’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control. The audit firm
must attest that management’s assessment of internal control over financial
reporting is stated fairly, in all material respects. The auditor must be satis-
fied that management has performed necessary testing and has formed an
accurate basis for its reporting and attestation.
An auditor can’t simply take management’s word that adequate testing has
been done. Auditors are required to form their own opinions about the accu-
racy of management’s reports and attestation and be able to support those
opinions with evidence and data from the testing.
Because SOX forecloses audit firms from performing consulting and other
nonaudit services (as discussed in Chapter 5), many are hoping to make up
the lost revenues on the Section 404 audits.
The outside audit firm can go about getting the evidence it needs in several
ways, including:
 Testing transactions: Performing its own tests on company transactions
to see if the internal controls that are supposed to be in place actually
kick in
 Verifying management’s assessment process: Retracing the steps taken
by management
166
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

 Evaluating and testing work done by others: Retesting a sampling of
transactions on internal control that were tested by the company’s own
staff (such as internal auditors) to see if their conclusions about the
company’s internal control can or should be used by the auditors
What the Auditors Are Looking For
What will auditors look at when they’re doing a Section 404 audit of your
company? They’re given guidance in this area by the Public Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) (discussed in Chapter 6). The PCAOB issues spe-
cial standards for public auditors to guide them in complying with SEC rules.
Auditing Standard No. 2 is of special importance with respect to Section 404
audits and SOX compliance. This particular standard addresses both the
work that is required to audit internal control over financial reporting and
also the relationship of the Section 404 audit to the audit of the company’s
financial statements as a whole.
What Is (and Is Not) 
Related to the Audit
A Section 404 audit focuses on a company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Internal controls operate as checks on processes that impact the
company’s financial statements. However, not everything is within the ambit
of the audit. For example, marketing decisions, unrelated administrative pro-
cedures, and most personnel policies probably aren’t things your auditors
should spend time and money digging into.
Examples of internal controls the auditors may be looking for may include:
 Policies and procedures for maintaining accounting records: All compa-
nies should have controls in place to ensure accurate recording of infor-
mation and protect against tampering.
 Procedures for authorizing receipts and disbursements and safeguarding
assets: SEC rules require that all transactions carried out within the
company should be appropriately authorized and employees and third
parties not be permitted to initiate transactions without appropriate
authority to do so.
 Tracking systems for use of the company’s resources: Transactions
involving the company’s resources should have controls to ensure that
resources (such as labor and inventory) aren’t diverted or misused as
the transaction progresses.
167
Chapter 12: Surviving a Section 404 Audit

 Verification of balances and transactions: Account balances and transac-
tion amounts should be verified.
 Appropriate segregation of responsibilities: Responsibilities should be
divided among different persons in a way that makes it harder to perpe-
trate fraud or error. For example, the employees authorizing payments
to vendors shouldn’t be the same ones cutting checks.
Taking the broad view, the auditors performing the Section 404 audit are in
charge of making sure that the board of directors, management, investors,
and others can rely on reported financial information when making decisions.
SOX was passed, in part, because of Congress’s concern about cases in which
fraudulent reporting on financial statements was initiated by management
and resulted from management’s ability to exploit weaknesses in internal con-
trol. Thus, under SOX, internal controls are now assessed twice: once by
management, and once by the auditors.
Complying with Audit Standard No. 2
During congressional hearings on Enron, senior management complained to
Congress that at the time, it wasn’t aware of the illegal activities taking place
at Enron, and the independent auditors didn’t bring any problems to manage-
ment’s attention. To remedy this all-too-common scenario, Congress created
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) as a new arm of
the SEC, replacing the system of accounting self-regulation that had previously
been in place. Section 404 directs the SEC to create rules for implementation,
and the SEC in turn directs the PCAOB to create standards for auditors.
PCAOB Standard No. 2 was approved by the SEC on June 17, 2004, and is
effective for audits of internal control over financial reporting required by
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This section summarizes
the key provisions of Auditing Standard No. 2.
Evaluating management’s assessment
The starting place for the audit of a company’s internal control over financial
reporting is management’s own assessment of the effectiveness of the com-
pany’s internal control. The auditor evaluates this assessment with the intent
of gaining confidence that management has a basis for its conclusions.
The assessment contains information that helps the auditor understand the
company’s internal control. It’s also a primary source for the evidence the
audit firm needs to support its own opinion under Section 404(b).
168
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

In preparing its assessment, management generally performs its own testing of
the company’s internal control. This testing can positively or negatively impact
how much work the audit firm must perform because the audit firm is permit-
ted to rely on testing of management that it has independently verified.
Good organization and structure within the company can make it easier for
the audit firm to independently test and verify the results of the testing
already done by the company. Auditing Standard No. 2 allows the auditor to
use, to a reasonable degree, work performed by others, which means that the
more extensive and reliable management’s assessment is, the less extensive
and costly the work of the independent auditor’s needs to be. For example, if
management has tested controls on a certain type of transaction by giving
employees questionnaires, the audit firm may be able to rely on the question-
naires upon verifying their authenticity and scope (the matters surveyed
must be appropriate for the particular internal control being tested).
Software can streamline the audit process and substantially reduce the final
bill of the independent audit firm. Good SOX software tools that generate spe-
cific reports on Section 404 tests performed by management and internal
auditors are available. These software tools also maintain user-friendly data-
bases for external auditors to draw upon. Chapters 14 and 15 cover SOX-
specific software on the market and look into some examples.
The more clearly management documents its internal control over financial
reporting, the easier it is for the auditor to understand the following:
 The nature of the internal control being tested
 How diligently management performed the testing
 Whether management used appropriate criteria in its assessment
Walking through the controls in place
It’s the independent auditor’s job to make sure that the controls a company
has in place are operating as intended. Auditing Standard No. 2 explains that
auditors must interview company personnel, but that alone is insufficient.
The auditors must perform independent testing to confirm their understand-
ing of how the internal controls work.
Tests the auditors may perform to gain an understanding of the company’s
internal controls may include the following:
 Observing the personnel who actually perform the controls
 Reviewing documents that are used in or result from the controls
169
Chapter 12: Surviving a Section 404 Audit

 Comparing supporting documents (for example, sales invoices, con-
tracts, and purchase orders) to the accounting records
 Performing walkthroughs of the company’s significant processes
Walkthroughs play a major role in helping an auditor gain an understanding of
a company’s internal controls and are a required method of testing under
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2. In a walkthrough, the auditor identifies a
transaction from each major class of transactions and traces it from origina-
tion through the company’s accounting systems, information systems, and
financial accounting all the way to the reporting of that transaction on the
company’s financial statements.
Walkthroughs generate evidence for the audit firm to support or refute its
understanding of transaction processing and the internal controls in place.
Auditing Standard No. 2 requires walkthroughs at each annual audit of inter-
nal control over financial reporting. The PCAOB views walkthroughs as a crit-
ical test for confirming the auditor’s understanding of the controls as correct
and complete. Without actually “walking” transactions through the significant
processes each year, there’s a high risk that changes to internal control
processes could go undetected by the auditor.
When walkthroughs are performed, PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2 requires
the auditor to perform the walkthroughs rather than rely on walkthroughs
performed by company personnel. The latter would defeat the purpose of
informing the auditor and also would be inappropriate because the audit firm
needs to exercise its independent judgment with respect to the information
obtained at each stage of the walkthrough.
Auditing Standard No. 2 cautions that walkthroughs should be done by or
under the supervision of experienced auditors. Walkthroughs involve a lot of
judgment calls as to whether controls are working properly or need to be
investigated further. Inexperienced audit personnel who participate in the
walkthroughs should be closely supervised by senior audit staff so that what
occurs in the walkthrough is correctly interpreted and documented.
Inexperienced auditors may not catch subtle omissions or deviations.
Identifying assertions and 
significant accounts
For independent auditors, an important part of the audit process involves
identifying accounts and assertions that should be tested. Assertions are facts
contained in the financial statements that must be verified in the audit
process instead of simply assumed to be true. For example, an auditor may
verify that a particular asset actually exists or that a specific transaction
occurred.
170
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

Auditing Standard No. 2 recognizes that some accounts are more significant
than others; it provides criteria for auditors to identify significant accounts
for purposes of determining which accounts to test.
Usually, the auditor usually begins by comparing all the company’s accounts
to determine which are the most significant based on their dollar amounts.
The auditor may then look at other factors such as risks that inaccuracies in
particular accounts pose to the company. The factors that determine signifi-
cant accounts vary from company to company.
Some of the questions the auditor asks in evaluating controls relative to sig-
nificant accounts are:
 Has the company included all loans outstanding in its loans payable
account?
 Have marketable investments been valued properly?
 Does the company have the rights to the accounts receivable, and are
the loans payable the proper obligation of the company?
 Are the amounts in the financial statements appropriately presented,
and is there adequate disclosure about them?
Answering these questions helps the auditor identify the relevant financial
statement assertions for which the company should have controls.
Identifying “relevant” assertions is something that auditors did in audit
engagements prior to Section 404’s requirements. A significant assertion is a
line item or statement that would compromise the accuracy of the financial
statements if proven incorrect.
Evaluating the design of controls
To be effective, internal controls must be designed properly to catch errors,
irregularities, and misstatements that would otherwise show up on a com-
pany’s financial statements. Poorly designed controls can allow valuable
information to slip through the cracks, even if the control procedures are
conscientiously implemented.
At some point during the Section 404 audit, the auditor needs to assess the
design effectiveness of the company’s internal controls. The auditor must
determine whether the existing controls would be effective if they were used
as designed. The auditor must also decide whether all the necessary controls
are in place.
171
Chapter 12: Surviving a Section 404 Audit

The tests the auditor performs to evaluate design effectiveness may include:
 Interviewing company personnel
 Observing internal controls
 Performing walkthroughs (see “Walking through the controls in place”
earlier in this chapter)
Taking the “top-down” approach
A PCAOB release issued May 16, 2005, explains that auditors should use a
“top-down” approach in testing internal controls, which means that auditors
should not start testing every control but should prioritize. The top-down
approach means that companies should take an aerial view, and look at the
overall control company to identify the high-risk areas.
The controls that keep the highest risks in check are known as key controls.
Under the top-down approach, it is the key controls that should be tested.
Key controls may include those relating to customer payments, company dis-
bursements, or sensitive financial information. High-risk areas and key con-
trols are different for every company.
Strong internal controls prevent fraud as well as errors. Auditing Standard
No. 2 requires the auditor to specifically test controls intended to prevent or
detect fraud.
Testing operating effectiveness
The concept of operating effectiveness is closely related to design effective-
ness (see the preceding section). Even well-designed controls can fail if unan-
ticipated factors, such as poorly matched information gathering technology,
undermine them.
Auditing Standard No. 2 requires the auditor to obtain evidence about the
operating effectiveness of controls related to all relevant financial statement
assertions for all significant accounts and disclosures. The auditor may per-
form any of the following tests to obtain evidence:
 Interviewing appropriate company personnel.
 Inspecting relevant documentation, such as sales orders and invoices.
 Observing the controls in operation and performing the controls proce-
dures themselves.
172
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

 Standard No. 2 encourages “rotating tests of controls” that allow the
auditor to vary testing from year to year. Rotating tests have two 
advantages:
• They introduce unpredictability into the testing.
• They make it possible for auditors to respond to changes at the
company.
Each year’s audit must stand on its own, and auditors can’t rely on testing
from past audits for assessing operating effectiveness.
Timing the testing
SOX makes specific timing requirements for testing internal control: It
requires management’s assessment and the auditor’s opinion to address
whether internal control was effective as of the end of the company’s most
recent fiscal year.
Obviously, performing all necessary testing on the last day of a company’s
fiscal year isn’t very practical. To address this problem, Auditing Standard
No. 2 directs auditors to obtain evidence about operating effectiveness at dif-
ferent times throughout the year. It further requires the auditor to update
internal control tests or obtain additional evidence that the controls are
effective at the end of the company’s fiscal year.
Relying on other peoples’ work
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2 requires the auditor to understand the
results of procedures performed by company personnel (such as internal
auditors) and third parties working for the company. The auditor must
review all reports issued during the year by company personnel that address
internal controls over financial reporting; the auditor also must evaluate any
internal control deficiencies identified in those reports.
At a minimum, Auditing Standard No. 2 directs the auditor to consider the
results of tests performed by these personnel when
 Deciding how to approach the 404 audit.
 Forming an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting.
Auditing Standard No. 2 contains an important limitation on using the work of
others in an audit of internal control over financial reporting that isn’t con-
tained in the Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 65 (both are based
on the same concepts): Auditing Standard No. 2 requires that the auditor’s
own work provide the principal evidence for the audit opinion.
173
Chapter 12: Surviving a Section 404 Audit

Identifying control deficiencies
A control deficiency exists when an internal control doesn’t allow the com-
pany’s management or employees to prevent or detect misstatements in the
financial statements in a timely manner. A control deficiency may be deemed
a significant deficiency and material weakness depending on its magnitude.
An audit firm can generally issue an unqualified opinion on the Section 404
portion of the audit if significant deficiencies are discovered in the audit.
However, a material weakness may cause an auditor to issue an unfavorable
or qualified opinion on its Section 404 audit. (Companies generally strive to
obtain unqualified opinions and avoid unqualified ones, as discussed later in
this chapter in the section “Forming an opinion and reporting.”)
Auditing Standard No. 2 requires the auditor to evaluate the severity of all
control deficiencies identified either by the auditors or by management to
determine if they’re significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. The audi-
tor is also responsible for making sure that the company’s audit committee is
aware of control deficiencies that rise to a level of significance determined by
the company’s audit committee and the auditors.
The SEC and Auditing Standard No. 2 (specifically paragraph 9) offer some
guidance as to what makes a significant deficiency and what makes a material
weakness:
 A control deficiency is considered a significant deficiency if, by itself or
in combination with other control deficiencies, it results in more than a
remote likelihood that a misstatement could occur on the company’s
financial statements. The misstatement that could potentially occur
must be “more than inconsequential.”
 A significant deficiency is classified as a material weakness if, by itself or
in combination with other control deficiencies, it results in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement in the company’s annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
Auditing Standard No. 2 requires the auditor to communicate in writing to the
company’s audit committee and management all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses of which he or she is aware.
Working with the audit committee
Auditing Standard No. 2 identifies circumstances that may indicate the exis-
tence of deficiencies or material weaknesses within a company. The most
common such scenario is ineffective oversight of the company’s financial
174
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

reporting. Auditing Standard No. 2 explains that effective oversight by the
company’s board of directors, including its audit committee, is critical to the
company’s monitoring of its internal control.
SOX requires every public company to have an audit committee that over-
sees the company’s external financial reporting (as discussed in Chapter 7).
SOX makes the audit committee a communication portal between manage-
ment and the auditors.
Because the company’s board of directors is responsible for evaluating the
performance and effectiveness of the audit committee, Auditing Standard No.
2 requires that the auditor must communicate any significant deficiency or
material weakness found directly to the board of directors as well as to the
audit committee.
Normally, auditors and audit committees work well together because they
have parallel purposes in ensuring that financial statements are fairly repre-
sented and that effective internal controls are in place.
When the auditor determines that the company’s audit committee (which
theoretically oversees it) is ineffective, the auditor must inform the board of
directors.
Forming an opinion and reporting
Unqualified opinions are the best type of opinion an auditor can issue to a
company. An unqualified opinion means that the auditor believes, without
reservation, that the company’s financial statements were prepared in accor-
dance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Auditing Standard No. 2 allows auditors to express an unqualified opinion if,
after performing all the procedures and tests considered necessary for the
Section 404 audit, he or she has identified no material weaknesses in internal
control. In the event that the auditor can’t perform all the procedures he or
she considers necessary, the auditor can qualify or disclaim (refuse to issue)
an opinion. If the auditor takes either of these actions, Auditing Standard 
No. 2 requires an explanation of the reasons behind the action.
Additionally, SEC Regulation S-X 2-02(f) provides:
The attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over
financial reporting shall . . . state the opinion of the accountant as to whether
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant’s internal con-
trol over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects, or must
include an opinion to the effect that an overall opinion cannot be expressed.
If an overall opinion cannot be expressed, explain why.
175
Chapter 12: Surviving a Section 404 Audit

The auditor’s report is to include two opinions under the Section 404 audit
addressing each of the following:
 Management’s assessment of the company’s internal control
 The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
The auditor’s Section 404 report must follow the same disclosure model as
management’s assessment, and the SEC’s final rules implementing Section
404(a) require management’s assessment to disclose only material weak-
nesses, not significant deficiencies (as discussed in the section “Identifying
control deficiencies” earlier in this chapter).
Flunking a 404 Audit
Preliminary research shows that anywhere from 5 to 15 percent of public
companies will flunk their Section 404 audits in their initial year of compli-
ance. Despite already spending large amounts to comply with Section 404,
these companies may need to invest even more substantial resources to cor-
rect the flaws found in the audits they fail.
How to flunk a Section 404 audit
A company essentially flunks its Section 404 audit when it receives either a
qualified or an adverse opinion from its auditors with respect to internal con-
trol. Either type of opinion reflects material weaknesses in internal control
that, in the opinion of the auditor, render it ineffective.
A qualified opinion may contain the dreaded phrase, “except for the effect of
the material weakness, internal control was effective.” An adverse opinion
more bluntly states “internal control over financial reporting was not effec-
tive.” Both types of opinions basically mean the company has flunked its 404
audit with respect to the effectiveness of internal control.
If the auditor and the company’s management disagree about whether a
material weakness exists (that is, the auditor concludes a material weakness
exists but management does not), the auditor may render an adverse opinion
on management’s assessment. This is another way to flunk a 404 audit.
176
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

What to do if your company flunks
If your company receives a qualified or adverse audit opinion with respect to
its internal control, there’s not much you can do to change the opinion.
Effectiveness of internal control is measured at year’s end, and the 404 audit
process is intended to obtain a snapshot as of that date. However, moving
forward, the company needs to analyze material weaknesses and deficiencies
and take proactive measures to correct the situation before subsequent
audits occur. Recommended proactive measures include the following:
 The audit committee should carefully review the nature of the material
weakness identified with the independent auditors.
 The audit committee should hire appropriate independent consultants
(neither affiliated nor related to the company or the audit firm) to
decide remedial actions.
 The company should follow through with the implementation of addi-
tional controls recommended by the audit committee and its consul-
tants and document that this action has been taken.
 Management should work to simplify and update internal control struc-
tures where possible (such as getting rid of paper ledgers).
 Management should use feedback from the prior Section 404 audit and
other available information to eliminate redundant processes.
 The company should implement appropriate software solutions to
enhance internal control.
 Management should elicit feedback from performing and documenting
testing.
 Management should fire or reassign personnel responsible for lapses in
implementing internal controls.
 The company should begin testing well in advance of subsequent
Section 404 audits.
 Management should compare test results to that of the prior year to see
if newly implemented controls have achieved a higher level of accuracy
and reliability.
These corrective measures will also help prevent fraud or financial loss that
could result from ineffective internal control.
A company that receives an adverse or qualified opinion in a Section 404
audit should carefully explore its legal exposure to shareholders who may
sue the company alleging they’ve been damaged by management’s failure to
implement effective internal control structures.

 Controlling Section 404 project costs
 Streamlining documentation
 Figuring out who’s running the risks and manning the controls
 Getting to know COBIT
A
n audit of a company’s internal control under Section 404 can turn into a
mushroom cloud of resources and manpower that leaves little construc-
tive value when the smoke clears. To avoid this scenario, most companies
approach the Section 404 compliance process as a series of projects, with
each project having the clear objective of testing a specific type of internal
control within the company. Every project in a Section 404 audit must be well-
managed, and the information that results from it must fit into the scheme of
the Section 404 audit so that management can confidently attest to internal
control within the company.
Successful Section 404 compliance under SOX means being able to see the
big picture and how a lot of smaller pictures fit into it. This chapter gives you
some practical guidelines for managing Section 404 projects and introduces
you to the useful COSO framework and auditing standard (SAS 70) developed
to help companies in this area.
SOX, in the grand scheme of things, requires companies to study their own
internal processes. Under Section 404, people responsible for generating doc-
umentation may also be empowered to come up with ideas for improving
processes.

The Price of the Project
The major source of criticism of SOX Section 404 is the sheer cost of imple-
menting it. Corporations across the country experience the sticker shock of
compliance (as discussed in Chapter 11); actual Section 404 costs exceed
projected ones at a staggering rate, and companies everywhere scramble to
understand why. This section takes a look at some of the most common
costs, both financial and otherwise, associated with a 404 audit.
The six most common Section 404 
project costs
Companies are more alike than they are different when it comes to the costs
of complying with SOX Section 404. A typical SOX 404 compliance project
produces labor costs that fall into the following categories:
 Documenting the company’s processes: A substantial skilled staff is
required to document and chart all the processes that directly impact a
company’s financial statements and the controls and risks associated
with each process.
 Testing the company’s process controls: Section 404 requires consider-
able manpower to test controls, such as company policies, cross-checks,
records, and internal accounting and audit procedures, associated with
all company processes.
 Documenting information technology controls: Companies have to test
the controls on their information technology systems. Examples of these
types of controls include controls on data gathering, computer networks,
and the company’s computer hardware systems.
 Reviewing and editing all documentation: Additional manpower is 
necessary to review all the documentation collected on the company’s
processes and controls. (For more on these costs, check out the “Meeting
massive manpower requirements” section later in this chapter.)
 Testing documentation: After all process-related documentation is com-
piled and edited, a company needs the staff to test it. Software tools, as
discussed in Chapter 14, are particularly useful for helping staff in this
area and thus reducing manpower requirements.
 Audit fees: Above all, companies must contend with large 404 audit fees
from outside CPA firms.
180
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

Meeting massive manpower requirements
The most significant cost a company faces in complying with Section 404
comes from the sheer manpower required to document control processes
and the results of test on those processes. SOX requires several levels of doc-
umentation, some of which may be prepared by the company and some of
which must be outsourced. Generally, a company can save a lot of money by
using its own employees to compile documentation rather than “outsourc-
ing” the same job to another company. For example, if your company is able
to pay employees their usual wages for compiling information about cash dis-
bursements rather than paying a CPA or consulting firm to do it, the savings
can be substantial.
To be in a position to realize this type of savings, your company must have
capable employees in place to do the tasks and create the documentation
required. The personnel on a payroll who are responsible for SOX compliance
generally include the following:
 Project managers: Project managers know a little something about the
employees in their departments who are assigned to a Section 404 pro-
ject, so they can coordinate the employees’ work to bring the project to
completion. The project manager is responsible for
• Verifying quality control of the work everyone does on the project
• Monitoring all aspects of the project’s progress
• Reporting progress to management
• Meeting certain milestone dates in the project’s progress
 Internal accounting staff: Most SOX-compliant companies dedicate sig-
nificant staff within their accounting departments to test accounts and
accounting controls and conduct audits to determine compliance with
company policies that affect internal financial controls. The outside
independent audit firm may “test the tests” performed by the internal
accounting staff by sampling their results.
 Information technology staff: A critical subject of internal control test-
ing is information technology and how company systems and policies
impact the data used to prepare financial statements. Significant staff
within the information technology department must be assigned to test-
ing and compiling documentation on these controls.
If your company is of the smaller variety, with common stock valued at less
than $75 million, you may be in the process of complying with Section 404.
Many larger companies, however, have already complied with Section 404,
and you can benefit from their experiences. Industry publications and SEC
disclosures filed by these companies (available on the SEC Web site at www.
181
Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

sec.gov) can yield important information relevant to planning your com-
pany’s Section 404 projects. (For more information about how to review doc-
uments filed by companies with the SEC, take a look at Chapter 4.)
The social challenges of Section 404
Every project in a company needs the support of the people involved in exe-
cuting it to realize a successful outcome. Your company can save consider-
able time and money on Section 404 projects by enlisting the support and
cooperation of the company’s board of directors, the chief executive officers
(CEOs), department heads, project managers, and other key personnel.
It’s more time efficient to enlist this cooperation at the outset than to con-
tend with internal power struggles along the way. It’s unlikely staff will coop-
erate if their managers responsible are equivocal about the project’s benefit
or skeptical about the way things are being carried out.
Most human resource experts recommend that department heads and pro-
ject managers initiating a new Section 404 project call special kick-off meet-
ings to introduce the top-level project management. This meeting offers an
opportunity to explain the value of the project as well as its objectives.
Hail to the Documenters
The success or failure of most projects associated with a Section 404 project
depends on the quality of the documentation generated. The most skilled
people on a project are usually in charge of creating, editing, and approving
the documentation before the project is handed off for the next phase of the
audit. This section identifies some skills and practices for generating good
project documentation.
The right documentation skills
Laws, regulations, and the standards they set are what drive the documenta-
tion on a Section 404 project. The documentation must respond to all the rele-
vant standards, answering the questions posed pursuant to those standards.
Therefore, documenters must know what information can safely be discarded
and what must be scrupulously retained. They also have to present the infor-
mation so that compliance with the relevant standards is clearly apparent.
182
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

Documenters must understand the following standards:
 Standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB) (see Chapter 6)
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally
Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) (see Chapter 5)
 SEC rules
 COSO and COBIT standards (discussed in the sections “Evaluating
Control with the COSO Framework” and “A bit about COBIT” later in this
chapter, respectively)
Section 404 documenters must also be skilled communicators on both techni-
cal and nontechnical levels. Specifically, they must be able to
 Interview other employees about their day-to-day duties to the extent
those duties impact processes covered under Section 404.
 Prepare flowcharts and reports of business processes.
 Help identify risks to internal controls and recommend how those risks
can be avoided or minimized.
Well-trained documenters save a company a lot of time. Prior to preparing any
documentation, the project manager should meet with the documenters to
ensure they understand the project scope and how much detail to document.
Getting the documentation down
Before documenters can do their jobs, they need to know how they’re going
to document. Every documenter needs to follow a set of predetermined steps
to document each process. The project manager is responsible for spelling
out these steps in writing before work begins. Additionally, the project man-
ager needs to assign a budget for each task and let the documenters know
how long documentation is expected to take. Documenters should track the
actual hours it takes to get the project done for each process and measure
their hours against the project manager’s estimate (for more on documenta-
tion and time, see the following section “Time tracking”).
183
Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

Time tracking
Section 404 project managers have a daunting job in making sure their pro-
jects are completed correctly and within the time frames necessary to inte-
grate the project results into the scheme of the entire 404 audit process.
Accuracy and timeliness are critical, but an important secondary goal for
project managers is ensuring that their projects are accomplished efficiently
and inefficiencies in conducting a first-year project aren’t repeated in subse-
quent years.
Tracking the time spent on the project by everyone involved in its execution
is a valuable way of identifying inefficiencies in the testing process that may
be attributable to some of the following causes:
 Vague scope definition: If the scope and objectives of the project are
poorly defined at the outset, effective time tracking systems can indicate
whether staff may be forced to spend inordinate amounts of time clarify-
ing their roles. Staff can also waste time documenting data extraneous to
the project goals or omitting data that should have been included in the
results of a particular testing project. For more on project scope, jump
to the section “Scoping out savings” later in this chapter.
 Untrained staff: A good project manager knows the skill levels of the
people involved in the project and therefore can estimate how long tasks
should take. Staff who spend excessive time on a task may be encounter-
ing unanticipated issues that require follow-up, or they may be training on
the job. Time tracking helps identify skills lacking on a project in a prior
year and as well as staff that aren’t performing up to project standards.
 Poor budgeting and estimates: A project may be taking too long
because of unexpected glitches and adverse findings, or it may simply
be that no one knew how long it was supposed to take. Time tracking
can help with 404 project budgets in future years.
Time tracking is so vital to the economics of a Section 404 project that one or
more team members may be assigned to the sole task of tracking the time
spent by the rest of the project team members.
Scoping out savings
The key to working cost effectively and even saving money when complying
with Section 404 is defining the scope of each project.
Clearly defining the scope of the project benefits the company in two ways: It
prevents unnecessary work and redundant work, and it ensures that only
required data is gathered (so the project can come in on schedule).
184
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

Scope definition includes identifying:
 The project’s objectives: What controls is the project testing?
 What data should be gathered: What information is being documented
to meet the objectives? What’s the standard for determining if a particu-
lar event is significant enough (material) to be reported in the project
results?
 Where the data should be gathered from: Which company locations,
departments, and transactions are the subject of the testing?
 Acceptable procedures for gathering the data: What tasks will be per-
formed according to the parameters of the project?
Defining the scope of a project should be a formal, written endeavor. Section
404 project managers should take a page from the book of information tech-
nology managers, who almost always require a formal written scope state-
ment for any new project. Writing out a formal project scope statement
avoids backtracking and second-guessing later on; it also prevents manage-
ment from attempting to expand the scope of a given project without for-
mally authorizing it.
Taking an inventory of your 
company processes
A good inventory of processes presents an opportunity for saving time and
money on a Section 404 project. In this context, a process is a collection of
procedures and activities for recording company transactions. Some exam-
ples of business processes include:
 Preparing a requisition to buy inventory
 Documenting a customer sale
 Making a bank deposit
 Processing a credit card transaction
Getting ’em all
Chief executive officers dread nothing more under Section 404 than the possi-
bility of missing a key process in a Section 404 audit because they must person-
ally certify, under fear of both civil and criminal penalties, the effectiveness of
their company’s internal controls and processes. (For more on management
and board certifications, turn to Chapter 9.)
185
Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

Many large companies (accelerated filers, as discussed in Chapter 3) have
already completed the Section 404 process. If your company’s Section 404
compliance is still underway, you can benefit from the information other
companies have already filed with the SEC in their annual and periodic
reporting documents. Much of this information is available on the SEC Web
site at www.sec.gov.
Identifying the key processes in your company may require the following:
 Looking to see what other companies in your industry have already
documented: Outside consultants that have worked with other compa-
nies in your industry may have already compiled process lists that you
can work from.
 Meeting with your own middle managers: Talking to managers, depart-
ment heads, project managers, and others familiar with key company
processes can help you develop comprehensive process lists.
 Capitalizing on “canned” lists: Many software documentation tools on
the market contain their own helpful process lists. For example, the
American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) sells a COSO
Control Environment checklist on its Web site at www.cpa4biz.com.
This is a good tool to start with in gathering information about your
company’s controls. (COSO standards are discussed in more detail in
the section “Evaluating Control with the COSO Framework” later in this
chapter.)
When documenting processes, it’s important for the documenters to under-
stand how financial processes may overlap with company processes that are
considered unrelated to the financial statements. Documenters need to
gather documentation on processes potentially relevant to financial reporting
and be wary of increasing the costs of the project by testing irrelevant con-
trols. For example, aspects of how a company runs its manufacturing plant
(operational processes) or legal compliance measures can potentially impact
financial statements. Project managers must make a determination as to what
reasonably needs to be stated.
Starting with charting
Most companies use flowcharts to help them identify business processes. For
example, a company may create a detailed chart of its manufacturing or sales
cycle and fill in the processes related to each stage. More flowcharts may be
used in the 404 process to document accounting cycles. Ultimately, a final
round of flowcharts may be created for the processes themselves, document-
ing both the steps in the process and how the processes relate to each other.
186
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

Looking at the ledger
The company’s general ledger is likely to be an important source of informa-
tion for documenting company processes because general ledgers are
chronological records of the company’s accounting transactions. The general
ledger shows the effect of each transaction on the accounts reflected on the
financial statements.
Ranking the processes
After processes are inventoried, a company has to figure out which processes
are most significant. It’s impossible to test them all!
Most companies use some sort of objective system for scoring processes to
determine which are the most significant. They identify the factors that deter-
mine significance and apply those standards to each individual process in
order to produce a rating. The processes that rank the highest receive prior-
ity for Section 404 testing.
Some factors that contribute to the significance value of a process include:
 The dollar amount associated with the process relative to the assets of
the company as whole
 The risk to the company if the process isn’t properly controlled
 The likelihood that the process can be subverted
 The type and availability of documentation associated with the process
and the ease of reviewing that documentation
 How well employees performing the process are supervised
Creating Section 404 dream teams
Good project teams save their companies money. The first step in creating a
good team is deciding what role each team member should play and picking
people with the right skills for each role.
Consider the following players when building a winning 404 project team:
 Process manager: The person in the company with management-level
responsibility for ensuring the process is correctly carried out.
 People who perform the process: The people who perform the financial
process on a daily basis should be consulted when it comes time to test
it because they’re familiar with the process’s intricacies.
 Information administrators: These people are the most familiar with
how information about the process is gathered within the organization.
187
Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

Communicating as colleagues
Team meetings go smoothly if everyone comes prepared, and preparation is
most important during a company’s initial Section 404 project team meetings.
For these meetings, the project manager should have a clear agenda and
information to share with the team about:
 The assertions being tested
 Possible risks
 Controls designed to mitigate the risks
 Procedures for documentation
 Estimates as to how long the project tasks should take
Walking through the process
One of the best ways to make sure the Section 404 project meets its objec-
tives is to attempt a dry run. Have your team try documenting one process,
and review that documentation. Discuss the format and completeness of
what the team produces as well as changes the team needs to make before
documenting the remaining processes.
Organizing the documentation: Why form
is equal to substance
A good set of forms can be a great cost-saver on a Section 404 project. The
documentation gathered in all of the company’s 404 projects should use a
consistent, easy-to-read and ready-to-review format. The document forms
should contain information not only about the tests performed but also
about who performed the tests. Standardizing forms within the 404 audit
helps team members work efficiently and coordinate their efforts. It also
makes the forms easier to review and lessens the risks of overlooking impor-
tant information.
Good Section 404 documentation usually contains the following:
 Information about the process being tested: A process is commonly
explained and illustrated using a flowchart like the one shown in 
Figure 13-1, which examines an inventory control process.
Visio is an easy-to-use computer program for creating flowcharts for
documenting processes. You can download a trial version of this pro-
gram at www.visio.com.

 A summary of the risk and controls associated with the process: The
procedures for identifying risks are explained in the section “Caveats
about Controls” later in this chapter. For the most part, risks and con-
trols usually are identified and tracked using a software program such as
SarbOxPro, which I discuss in Chapter 15.
 Identification of the controls used to prevent the risk: To get a clean
bill of health on its 404 audit, the company should have at least one
effectively working control for each risk. The project team should iden-
tify the controls in place on the standard project form.
Caveats about Controls
A control is what prevents a risk from happening. There should be at least
one control for each risk. If the risk of a flawed control could allow a material
error to creep into a company’s financial statements, that control needs to be
tested. A material error is one that is deemed financially significant based on
a standard established by the audit committee and independent auditors.
Design your Section 404 tests so a single test covers as many controls as 
possible.
PCAOB standards state that the independent auditor must
 Test each relevant assertion the company makes on the financial state-
ments it files with the SEC

Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

As a practical matter, a financial statement assertion can form the basis of a
404 project within the company. For each assertion, the company should deter-
mine all the scenarios and situations that could cause it to be inaccurate. Such
risks include the possibility that account balances may be understated or over-
stated or that assets may be undervalued or overvalued. Project managers and
auditors must look at all the scenarios that could cause any of these risks to be
the case. For example, an employee may be falsifying payable records to a
vendor, thus overstating accounts payable; unauthorized disbursements may
be lowering other account balances, or assets may be overvalued.
Although testing for all risks is impossible, companies are expected to have a
control in place for every identified risk and to test “key” controls. This prior-
itization is known as the “top-down” approach.
Key controls
A control that prevents a material risk is known as a key control. The key con-
trols in every company are different, based on the type of goods and services
a company provides and its own peculiar accounting processes. Some ques-
tions to ask when identifying key controls at your company are:
 Does the control prevent fraud or inaccuracy?
 Does the control safeguard assets?
 How significant (material) could the impact be if the control failed?
Many controls will be included in the first two categories, so the question of
whether a control is a key one will generally hinge on the issue of materiality.
Materiality is usually (but not always) measured as some sort of dollar
amount. Every company must decide on an appropriate level of materiality.
Some common key controls
Although company controls vary and must constantly evolve as new risk fac-
tors are identified, some controls are common to most companies. This sec-
tion examines a few of these standard controls.
Segregation of duties
Segregation of duties exists when responsibility for a financial process is
divided among several people so that no one individual can misappropriate
company assets. For example, segregation of duties for accounts payable
may be accomplished by making sure the same person isn’t responsible for
more than one of the following tasks:
190
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

 Authorizing an accounts payable transaction
 Entering data for an accounts payable transaction
 Having custody of the assets used to pay the transaction
 Disbursing assets to pay the vendor
 Performing a control to verify the accounts payable transaction
Authorization procedures
An authorization control is in place when more than one person in a company
has to authorize a decision or action that can impact the company’s assets or
financial statements. For example, managers’ approval may be required for a
disbursement.
Reconciliations
Reconciliation is a control process of verifying one account balance by compar-
ing to another account balance that should be affected by the same transac-
tion. If the first account can’t be balanced or reconciled using this technique,
an error may be present or fraud may be occurring within the company.
Ogling the Outside Vendors: 
SAS 70 Reports
Almost every company subject to SOX outsources something, but the one
thing a company can’t outsource is responsibility for matters that impact its
financial statements. According to Auditing Standard SAS 70, if a company
outsources functions, it must establish that adequate internal control is
maintained at the outside vendor.
If outside vendors perform significant financial processes or handle key con-
trols for your company, SOX requires you to vouch for the controls in place
at those third-party vendors.
Often, third-party vendors have audit reports prepared by their own auditors
and are happy to hand them out to valued customers. If your company
chooses to rely on such third-party reports, known as SAS 70 reports, keep
the following requirements in mind:
 Timing: The SAS 70 report must be completed close enough to your com-
pany’s year-end that the third-party controls described in the report can
be expected to remain in place at the end of your company’s fiscal year.
 Covered controls: The SAS 70 report must cover all the controls your
company relies on given the services the third-party vendor supplies.
191
Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

 Effectiveness of controls: Third-party controls must be effective for
detecting errors material to your company. Sometimes, a third-party
company designates a materiality limit that’s much higher than your
company would consider appropriate, which means the control in place
is less stringent.
The SAS 70 report provided by your third-party vendor doesn’t fulfill these
requirements; your company needs to perform its own audit of that process.
As a practical matter, a competitive vendor will strive to provide its clients
with an SAS 70 report on which they can rely. To review a sample SAS 70
report, flip to Appendix G.
Design your Section 404 tests so a single test covers as many controls as 
possible.
Evaluating Control with the 
COSO Framework
In 1985, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) was formed to study factors that can lead to fraudulent
financial reporting by businesses. In 1992, this commission issued a publica-
tion titled Internal Control — Integrated Framework. This document is the
most widely relied upon framework in the U.S. and set of standards for busi-
nesses to evaluate their internal control systems. (The SEC specifically cites
the COSO framework as a set of standards management may use permissibly
in evaluating internal control.)
Your company is likely to use the COSO framework in conjunction with other
standards it has developed.
How COSO breaks down 
companies’ controls
The COSO framework views a company’s overall internal control environ-
ment as consisting of five components:
 Control environment: How decisions and policies are made within a
business and how authority and responsibly are assigned
 Risk assessment: How the processes performed within each department
may impact the company’s financial statements
192
Part III: Surviving Section 404 

 Control procedures: Those that limit risk
 Information and communication: How polices and control structures
are communicated to people within the organization
 Monitoring: Whether controls are actually operating as expected
The COSO framework takes a very people-oriented approach to the evalua-
tion of internal controls, viewing internal control as “a process, effected by an
entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to
provide reasonable assurance” with respect to the following issues that may
impact a company’s financial statements:
 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations
 Reliability of financial reporting
 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
The COSO Web site (www.coso.org) explains that internal control is “a
process. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself. . . . Internal control is
effected by people. It’s not merely policy manuals and forms, but people at
every level of an organization.”
COSO guidance for your company
The SEC mandates that your company develop its internal control standards
with reference to those developed by COSO or a similar organization.
The COSO framework provides guidance in the following areas:
 Project planning: COSO provides guidelines and suggested procedures
for helping your company determine how to structure project teams and
documentation as well as coordinate with internal auditors.
 Identifying control objectives: COSO contains credible standards that
your company can rely upon in identifying which controls are key ones
and in determining levels of materiality for testing.
 Documenting controls: COSO contains documentation guidelines and
formats as well as discussion about coordinating your company’s inter-
nal documentation with that of the independent auditors.
 Testing and evaluating controls: COSO provides procedural guidelines
for conducting tests and standards for evaluating the reliability of partic-
ular internal controls.

www.coso.org for great articles and resources on evolving Section 404 audit
standards, procedures, and trends.

Chapter 13: Taking the Terror Out of Testing

A Bit about COBIT
COBIT, or Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, refers
to a set of generally applicable and accepted standards for information tech-
nology. COBIT standards provide a reference framework specifically for IT
control systems as opposed to financial control systems as a whole. The
standards relevant to SOX include best practices for each IT process and
models to assist in improving internal controls.
The COBIT standards are issued by a not-for-profit organization called the IT
Governance Institute (ITGI). In 2003, the ITGI also published IT Control
Objectives for Sarbanes-Oxley, which specifically addresses the financial
reporting aspects of COBIT. Most COBIT information is available for free
downloading at www.isaca.org/cobit.htm.

f you’re a software geek at heart, this part’s for you.
The chapters in this part can guide you through the
task of choosing the right software solution for any size
company. To illustrate the types of issues SOX-specific
software can solve, this part also looks at a couple of
simple, economical products on the market.

Chapter 14
Surveying SOX Software
In This Chapter
 Getting an update on the latest software trends
 Revealing what SOX software does for companies
 Knowing what questions to ask software vendors
 Looking at the standards used for designing software (COSO and COBIT)
 Deciding if SOX software is worth the cost
T
horoughly testing your company’s internal control under the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act’s Section 404 is expensive, but the right software tool can
soften the blow. Rather than reinvent the wheel, your company can purchase
a single software package to prioritize risks, identify key controls for testing,
develop standardized forms, and create a system for entering and storing
SOX 404 documentation. Many off-the-shelf products are available, which
means your company may not have to engage expensive consultants to
design a customized solution.
Selecting the right SOX software tool can be a pivotal decision for your com-
pany. This chapter addresses some SOX software packages on the market and
looks at the ways companies can use them to streamline compliance with the
dreaded SOX Section 404 (discussed in excruciating detail in Chapter 11). This
chapter also examines the special COSO standards developed for companies
to structure the testing of their internal financial control as well as the sepa-
rately developed COBIT standards developed by information technology pro-
fessionals. (Most SOX software is designed to comply with the COSO and
COBIT standards.)
Some SOX Software Trends
Software vendors are flocking to the SOX software market, offering products
for all manner of companies and projects. As of this writing, it’s estimated
that 85 percent of Fortune 500 companies will be using SOX software prod-
ucts developed outside their companies by the end of 2005.

According to a 2005 estimate in Business Week Magazine, the market for
Sarbanes-Oxley software could be worth $1 billion to $4 billion by 2008.
This section provides you with some useful background information about
the SOX software industry to help you evaluate the viability of the companies
from which you may decide to purchase a product. (It is indeed a concern
whether or not your software vendor will be around in a year or two when
your company is considering a major financial commitment.) Some of the sig-
nificant economic trends on the SOX software industry include the following:
 Customized consulting for big firms: Large accounting and IT consult-
ing firms are being hired to create customized software for many of their
clients.
 Off-the-shelf software for the smaller firms: Small firms and not-for-
profits are optioning for off-the-shelf starter programs, such as
SarbOxPro (discussed in Chapter 15), that help them document controls
and procedures from scratch.
 The lack of a dominant market leader: Currently, no particular vendor
has a dominant share of the SOX market. With more than 60 companies
offering products, consolidation of some companies and their client
bases is inevitable. What this shifting market means is that some compa-
nies may go out of business, and their products will no longer be sup-
ported, or that you may end up working with a vendor different from the
one with whom you originally contracted.
 No track records: Because SOX is still relatively new, no company has a
track record of multiple releases and a big beta trail. Bugs and flaws are
to be expected, and the products will likely be de-bugged and improved
based on user feedback and the market data.
 Costs: SOX-specific software products range anywhere from $2,500 to
millions depending on whether an off-the-shelf solution is selected or
the company opts for costly customization from a consulting firm.
However, one cost characteristic is assured across the board: In every
organization, the cost of the software is very small in relation to the
costs of labor and training employees and consultants to use it.
 Add-ons abound: Some software vendors, such as Hyperion Solutions
Corp, are adding modules and capabilities for SOX compliance to exist-
ing financial management programs. Popular add-ons include audit-trail
templates and components that document the flow of work within a
company to help identify processes that must be monitored for Section
404 compliance.
 Industry-specific programs find a niche: Some industries, such as bank-
ing, are finding vendors with programs and add-ons designed especially
for them. After the first-year crash compliance, many consulting firms
are likely to offer specific software for the industries that they most fre-
quently service.
198
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

In view of the market trends listed here, your company should carefully nego-
tiate license terms for SOX software. Don’t be shy about negotiating for
“extras” like longer warranties and clauses that allow you to terminate the
contract under circumstances such as disappointing software performance.
Intense competition for market share among SOX software vendors should
put your company in a strong negotiating position for favorable contract and
service terms when purchasing SOX software products.
At this stage of the game, your company should carefully consider what func-
tions software must provide and negotiate software contracts with a clear
understanding as to minimum performance standards.
Identifying the Types of 
Software on the Market
Many different types of SOX-related software products are on the market.
They offer different features and have widely different price structures. When
shopping for SOX software, make sure you’re comparing apples to apples by
keeping the following general categories in mind:
 One-stop SOX for small companies: Small companies find programs 
like SarbOxPro and ProCognis, the interfaces of which are illustrated in
Figures 14-1 and 14-2, particularly helpful. For a relatively nominal invest-
ment, these programs can help a small company create a centralized data-
base of controls and processes. The programs also track the testing done
on key controls as well as several aspects of the company’s control envi-
ronment. Software programs for small companies are designed to gather
SOX-related information to document the company’s overall compliance
with SOX with a single interface. These programs also generate reports on
processes, risks, controls, and compliance for management and process
owners to assess their effectiveness. For a relatively nominal investment
($1,000–$2,500), these comprehensive off-the-shelf programs provide an
overall framework COSO compliance (see “The COSO Standards for
Software” later in this chapter).
SarbOxPro is covered in more detail in Chapter 15.
 Monitoring tools: SOX has created a market for programs that provide
enhanced monitoring of company assets or communications. These pro-
grams are useful for companies that have SOX-compliant structures in
place but need to enhance the monitoring of the controls. An example of
this type of program is SpectorSoft (see Figure 14-3), which is available
at www.spectorsoft.com.

Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

 Industry-specific programs: Many software programs are designed to
perform specific SOX-related tasks or are designed for specific indus-
tries. For example, some programs monitor receivables and payables.
Industries with special overlapping regulatory requirements, such as the
mutual fund industry or healthcare industry, may benefit from off-the-
shelf software solutions tailored for these niche markets. For example,
Physmark (www.physmark.com) is a SOX software compliance product
designed especially for the healthcare industry.
 Customized IT solutions: Large accounting firms, such as KPMG, offer
special consulting services to help design and write software for their
clients. Generally, companies having gross revenues in excess of $75 
million (known as accelerated filers) opt for customized solutions.
 Task-specific software: Some software is designed to perform specific
tasks. For example, financial statement certification is designed to pro-
vide a process for management to sign off on the accuracy of the financial
statements for Section 302. (For more on management certifications and
Section 302, turn to Chapter 9.)
Although companies that use SOX software may switch products in subse-
quent years (or even in the current one), swapping software is likely to raise
regulatory issues as well as logistic ones.

Chapter 14: Surveying SOX Software

Shopping for SOX Software
Although most software vendors have Web sites and online brochures, SOX
software products can be very difficult to compare. Product demonstrations
generally take several hours, and generally it’s hard to get more than an
overview of such a complex product during a demo.
The following is list of questions management, IT committees, and process
owners should ask vendors when evaluating SOX software products for 
purchase:
 How versatile is the software? Does it fulfill all the functions the com-
pany needs for SOX compliance? Does it contain adequate functionality
for identifying processes and controls and for document management?
 What technology does the software require to run? Exploring technol-
ogy requirements ahead of time is particularly important for small com-
panies that may run into additional unanticipated outlays as a result of
being unprepared for the requirements of new software.
 Does the product interface well with the company’s existing systems?
What kind of customization is necessary for it to do so?
 How is historical company information imported into the system?
Does this information require special customization or formatting of
information?
 What other companies have used the product? What have been their
experiences?
 How large is the vendor’s current customer base? Does the vendor cur-
rently service a large customer base over which it can spread the costs
of support and additional research?
 What ongoing costs does the software carry? What’s the initial invest-
ment, and what are the maintenance fees? What upgrades are expected?
Does the vendor have a strategy for upgrading and developing the 
program?
 What are the software’s security and validation procedures? How is
the system protected from tampering and unauthorized access?
Software maintained by an application service provider and hosted on
the company’s network should have encrypted data transmission over
the Internet and regular backups.
 What type of training is offered by the vendor? Do the documenters,
auditors, and other personnel perceive the interface as easy to learn?
 What types of reports can be generated with the product? What type
of data is captured and included in the reports? Can sample reports be
viewed?
202
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

 Does the vendor have a sample database for demonstration purposes?
Can company representatives experiment by entering data into a
demonstration version of the program?
 Does the program facilitate document management and workflow?
How are relevant documents (such as flowcharts, prior reports, and so
on) imported, viewed, and referenced in the program so that those doc-
uments can be referenced for documenting processes and controls?
 Does the vendor have adequate staff and funding to support the prod-
uct? Is the vendor financially stable and well managed?
 Does the program offer standardized libraries of processes and con-
trols or other embedded content that can save the company time in
the initial years of compliance?
 Can the software be conveniently accessed from all company loca-
tions? Can it be used by everyone responsible for testing and document-
ing, or does it require specialized skills?
 Does the software offer any benefits beyond SOX compliance? Does it
have features that can help the company save money?
SOX Meets Cousin IT
Financial statements filed with the SEC are compiled from data gathered from
dozens, if not hundreds, of financial pulse points within a company. At most
companies, the accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting depend on the
information technology, or IT, environment. SOX Section 404 doesn’t explicitly
spell out requirements for corporate IT systems or procedures for gathering
information within a company to document internal control. So if a company
wanted to, it could theoretically document and test all its processes using
pen and paper. However, this method wouldn’t be very efficient and probably
wouldn’t inspire the confidence of the CEO or CFO forced to flip through
thousands of pages each quarter. For these reasons, IT plays a critical role in
the overall compliance process.
IT and SOX compliance will always go hand-in-hand. In fact, may experts have
indicated that the heads of IT departments (usually called chief information
officers, or CIOs) should be required to certify the financials for companies
along with CEOs and CFOs.
SOX requires senior management to include within the company’s annual 
10-K report filed with the SEC a separate internal control report to evaluate
processes for collecting, securing, retaining, and reporting financial informa-
tion. Companies also have to provide quarterly evaluations of changes that
materially impact internal control over financial reporting or could do so in
the future.
203
Chapter 14: Surveying SOX Software

Collecting scattered company data
Most companies already have considerable technology in place for SOX com-
pliance. However, the information gathered is likely to be in lots of places,
spread across databases maintained by many departments and locations.
Each department is likely to have its own standards and policies for gather-
ing the type of information it needs to conduct its operations and report its
results to management.
Many companies rely on SOX software to collect Section 404 data scattered
throughout the company. Because everyone uses a single data entry system,
the software can standardize Section 404 documentation throughout the
company. A software system endorsed by management and used by the com-
pany as a whole links the people gathering the documentation in different
departments, such as IT, accounting, and operations. The software also con-
nects personnel in different geographical locations and can coordinate the
compliance efforts of every subsidiary and division of a single company.
Evaluating your company’s existing 
IT systems: A checklist
Not every company needs to overhaul its existing IT systems to comply with
SOX. Some companies that have good internal controls and high levels of
standardization for testing and documentation may get by with relatively
minimal software upgrades and changes.
SOX-specific tasks
A public company’s IT systems must be able to perform certain SOX-related
tasks to ensure its ability to comply with Section 404. The following is a
checklist of needed capabilities to:
 Report transactions and collect data: Most companies currently collect
data on many financial transactions, including receivables, payables,
and collections. Thus, IT systems may already be in place to document
processes and controls as required by SOX.
 Investigate whistle-blower complaints: If an employee files a complaint
under the SOX whistle-blower provision (covered in Chapter 16), the
company must be able to locate the necessary data to investigate the
basis of the complaint. A company must have IT systems that allow
access to records that substantiate a culture of corporate compliance.
204
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

 Identify processes and control environments: Does the company cur-
rently document its processes? Does each department document them
using relatively uniform tools and output? If not, the company may bene-
fit from a software product that assists in creating a database of
processes and documenting workflow. The flowchart in Figure 14-4 illus-
trates how one such software product from ProCognis (available at
www.procognis.com) is structured to document the processes and
control environments of a company.
 Document existing controls: If the company doesn’t maintain a central-
ized database documenting its controls on various processes, a product
that offers an existing library of controls and tools for creating this 
type of database may be a critical component of the company’s 404 
compliance.
 Identify key controls: When a company takes an inventory of its inter-
nal controls, it needs to be able to determine which are the most signifi-
cant controls in terms of the risks they’re intended to prevent. Software
tools can identify the areas in which material risks are likely to occur as
well as the key controls for preventing those risks. For example, a soft-
ware program may identify key controls based on factors such as the
dollar amounts involved or the volume of transactions.

Chapter 14: Surveying SOX Software

 Create reliable reports: SOX requires that management know what’s
happening within the entire company to the extent necessary to certify
its internal controls. A company’s existing IT systems should have the
ability to summarize information in readable report formats that can be
reviewed by the process owners (the people responsible for ensuring the
accurate completion of the process within the company) and by man-
agement to fulfill both the requirements of Section 404 and the objec-
tives of Section 302.
 Perform accurate record retention: Records must be retained and
tracked as part of the company’s overall internal control and workflow
management. Document management software products and modules
designed specifically for this purpose are on the market.
 Track costs: SOX compliance is costly, but companies can save money
by planning individual SOX projects and tracking the costs associated
with them. If the company currently doesn’t have the IT infrastructure to
do these tasks, it should investigate software tools on the market for
doing so.
 Secure information: An important aspect of financial control within a
company is the ability to secure financial information so that only appro-
priate persons have access to it, and it can’t be improperly altered. Most
IT systems have security components in place that can be adapted for
an overall SOX-compliant system.
 Report events: Many software products on the market offer monitoring
capabilities to enhance a company’s existing internal controls. These
products monitor events such as unauthorized transactions or distribu-
tion of information and, in some cases, report such events to manage-
ment in real time.
Software strategies
Although many necessary technology components may be present to some
extent in a company’s existing IT framework, every company must decide
whether to:
 Refocus existing IT systems for SOX compliance
 Hire independent consultants to design customized systems
 Purchase products and modules already designed for SOX compliance
and train staff on using them
206
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

The COSO Standards for Software
Because SOX is silent as to the types of documentation that satisfy Section
404, the SEC provides some guidance to companies by directing them to a set
of standards developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Most SOX software is designed to comply
with the COSO standards. (For more on COSO, see the sidebar “Conforming
to the COSO standards.”)
The COSO standards provide welcome guidance to companies deciding how
to organize their documentation. Many software tools have interfaces and
formats designed to reflect compliance with COSO, using key terminology
from the COSO standards to identify the software functions.
What COSO says
The SEC directs companies to look for established, well-recognized standards
to use in documenting internal control and processes. It identifies the COSO
Internal Control Framework as its preferred set of standards and has yet to
identify any other set of standards.
The COSO framework provides five components that every software program
should address:
 Control environment: COSO requires every company to establish the
foundation for an internal control system by demonstrating that disci-
pline and structure exist within the organization and set the tone for
compliance. Having a good software system or well-designed IT compo-
nents in place can help document the existence of a strong control envi-
ronment and provide visibility of compliance processes.
 Risk assessment: Software applications can help management identify
risk factors by assisting in the compilation of data from surveys, com-
paring practices of the company to a statistical standard, and alerting
management to critical events and discrepancies (called exceptions).
 Control activities: COSO requires that companies evaluate the specific
policies and procedures that they have in place to ensure that manage-
ment’s directives are carried out. Companies have to document key
processes and identify the controls used to ensure the accuracy of those
processes. Software programs can help streamline this COSO compo-
nent by providing libraries of procedures and controls and user-friendly
interfaces that allow people documenting the controls to store the infor-
mation in a standardized format that can be retrieved by other people in
the organization.

Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 
Conforming to the COSO standards
COSO was originally formed in 1985 as an inde-
pendent private-sector initiative to study factors
that can lead to fraudulent financial reporting; it
developed recommendations for public compa-
nies and independent auditors.
The commission was jointly sponsored by five
major professional associations: the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, Financial Executives
International, The Institute of Internal Auditors,
and the National Association of Accountants
(now the Institute of Management Accountants).
The commission also had representatives from
industry, public accounting, investment firms, and
the New York Stock Exchange.

 Information and communication: An important component of the COSO
framework is the premise that internal controls can’t be properly imple-
mented unless the company has procedures for communicating the con-
trols to the people who are supposed to carry them out on every level.
Usually these procedures are carried out with software and information
technology.
 Monitoring: The quality of the internal controls must be assessed to
determine how effectively they detect irregularities. Monitoring also
assesses how well people within the organization implement the control.
Software programs and IT systems within the company should make
data available to assess both of these aspects of the control’s effective-
ness. Some programs provide continuous monitoring, and others track
data that can be analyzed by process owners and management at regu-
lar intervals.
Most companies in the United States use the COSO criteria outlined above in
designing their IT systems. For example, Figure 14-6 shows the model used by
the ProCognis software tool, which is a COSO-based design. (You can find

Chapter 14: Surveying SOX Software

Complying with COBIT
A separate but equally important set of standards with respect to SOX soft-
ware is the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, or
COBIT, developed by the IT Governance Institute (ITGI). The purpose of the
ITGI (www.isaca.org) is to set standards for measuring performance and
risk in information technology professions.
COBIT is a generally applicable and accepted standard for good information
technology (IT) security and control practices. These standards are intended
to provide “a reference framework for management, users, and IS audit, con-
trol and security practitioners.”
The COBIT standards can be downloaded for free at www.isaca.org. In 2003,
the ITGI published a document called, IT Control Objectives for Sarbanes-Oxley,
which adapts the COBIT standards specifically for SOX. Of COBIT’s usual 34 IT
processes and 318 detailed control objectives for IT professionals, the SOX
adaptation identifies 27 IT processes and 136 detailed control objectives as
critical to SOX compliance.
Will SOX Software Pay for Itself?
SOX requires detailed documentation and analysis of business processes
related to financial reporting and disclosures. The right software tools can
yield a wealth of data for implanting process improvements. For example,
organizations may find duplicate expenditures, redundant processes, and
opportunities to standardize processes among divisions and subsidiaries
that may offset the cost of complying with SOX.
It’s worth noting that in a recent poll by a research organization called the
Meta Group, 39 percent of firms surveyed said that SOX will eventually make
them more competitive.

In This Chapter
 Laying the groundwork before you install the software
 Deciding what information your SOX software should track
 Finding the simplest (and cheapest) software solutions available
S
OX software can be costly, but if yours is a small business, you have
plenty of options that won’t strain your petite IT budget. In fact, the three
off-the-shelf software solutions programs that I discuss in this chapter are
available for only a few thousand dollars. Each of these surprisingly versatile
programs offers a comprehensive framework for Section 404 compliance and
is designed to minimize training time.
In this chapter, I focus on some simple examples of SOX-compliant software
used primarily in smaller companies. As a good representative of the off-
the-shelf software solutions available, I’ve chosen to look at several sample
products, including SarbOxPro.
Note: If your company has already worked with costly consultants and 
implemented a solution, this chapter can still be useful to you as an aerial
view of how software and information technology go hand-in-hand with 
SOX compliance.
Doing Your Research Before 
a Software Installation
It’s never a good idea to throw money at a solution before you analyze the
problem. SOX software is a great tool for streamlining documentation — but
only if you lay the groundwork for implementing it. This section gives you a

sense of how to evaluate the flow of financial information in your company
prior to implementing a software solution and introduces you to the impor-
tant accounting concept of the trial balance.
Cost Advisors, Inc., the makers of SarbOxPro, has put together a terrific
report explaining the relationship of SOX and software. You can request 
a free copy of this report from the SarbOxPro Web site located at www.
sarboxpro.com.
Tracking the flow of information 
in your company
The flow of financial information within every company is unique; it’s based
on both the structure of the company and its subsidiaries and on the cycles
of the company’s business. According to Bill Douglas, CEO of Cost Advisors,
Inc. “It is important to start with a firm understanding of the big picture
(framework) around Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404. . . . There can be many enti-
ties within a single consolidated company and many [business] cycles within
each entity.” The flowchart shown in Figure 15-1 illustrates some of the key
terms you’ll come across in a Sarbanes-Oxley project that describe the flow
of information within a company.
SOX is primarily concerned with risks, controls, and tests — the bottom three
boxes to the bottom right of the diagram in Figure 15-1 — but the rest of the
information illustrated must be known about the company before risks, con-
trols, and tests can be gathered.
Some of the terms in Figure 15-1 stem from the SOX statute, Securities
Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, and COSO and COBIT standards (dis-
cussed in Chapter 13), and others are rooted in the vernacular that informa-
tion technology (IT) professionals have used for years in talking about the
flow of information to be documented within a company. Moving from left to
right on the diagram, each box represents increasingly specific information
about a company. In order to comply with SOX, you must proceed down the
hierarchy in this logical manner, generating increasingly specific information
about your company.
A documenter must identify a company and all its subsidiaries and locations
(entities) before proceeding to collect information about the cycles (sequences
of transactions) that occur within the company. After the documenter knows
about the business cycles (for example, a sales cycle moving from order to
final payment), he can begin to document the processes within that cycle. In
turn, after he knows the processes, he can move on to the controls and tests
for those processes using a reliable software product. Figure 15-2 illustrates a
sample business cycle for a customer sale.

Chapter 15: Working with Some Actual SOX Software

Following the trial balance trail
Traditionally, a trial balance is a document that adds up all the debits and
credits for transactions within a company so that mistakes can be traced if
debits don’t equal credits. (In Figure 15-1, the trial balance appears off to the
side and shaded.) Because most of today’s accounting software adds cor-
rectly, companies create trial balance reports as summaries of all the com-
pany’s individual transactions. Because the trial balance report tracks
transactions, it’s a valuable cache of information for Section 404 purposes.
The trial balance identifies all the income and asset accounts maintained by the
company from the date that the beginning balances were calculated to the
date the trial balance was “closed.” The trial balance effectively combines the
information summarized on both the balance sheet and Income Statement. If
all transactions and account adjustments have been recorded properly, the
debits and credits balance.
Figure 15-3 illustrates a simple trial balance. By looking at all the accounts in the
trial balance, you can identify the most significant ones on a strictly dollars-
and-cents basis. The more significant the account, the greater the risk of inac-
curacy on the financial statement if the account is misstated. Several SOX
software programs, including SarbOxPro, depend upon analysis of a trial bal-
ance (or a similar report) as the starting point for statistically identifying a
company’s most significant risks and key controls.
A trial balance is just one type of report used by a company to document its
transactions. (Not all companies will work with a trial balance to identify trans-
actions and processes.) Another type of report commonly used to glean
transaction and process data is a general ledger, which companies use to
record entries of transactions that occur without balancing the debits and
credits. In any event, all companies need to start SOX software preparations
by documenting transactions and processes, and corporate policies, struc-
tures, and individualized software solutions all may dictate how companies
go about this preparation.

Getting to Know SarbOxPro
SarbOxPro is an example of a software program designed to
 Create a system for documenting internal control.
 Maintain all the internal control information required for a company’s
Section 404 compliance in a single repository.
SarbOxPro is a relatively simple software program that uses the information
in your company’s trial balance to help identify both the greatest risks to
your company and the key controls in place to mitigate the most significant
risks. As of this writing, SarbOxPro costs under $3,000.
A product like SarbOxPro can really help a company get its arms around an
elephant like SOX. If your company meets any of the following characteris-
tics, you may want to consider using SarbOxPro:
 Small to medium-size public companies
 Nonpublic companies (including not-for-profit companies) that opt to
become SOX-compliant
 Companies with limited budgets
 Companies that use Microsoft Office products
The SarbOxPro checklist
Cost Advisors, Inc., the makers of SarbOxPro software, have created a con-
cise checklist for software implementation that you can download at (www.
sarboxpro.com). This checklist, shown in Figure 15-4, can be used can be
used effectively with many products on the market. It reflects the steps that,
according to the SarbOxPro folks, every company has to complete for its 
SOX software to both save the company money and comply with the law.
Hey, this looks familiar: 
The SarbOxPro data tree
For anyone familiar with Windows Explorer and its data tree structure of fold-
ers and documents, SarbOxPro is an intuitive program. The SarbOxPro data
tree looks a lot like Windows Explorer’s, as you can see in Figure 15-5; in
SarbOxPro, you can directly create or remove elements in the data tree, such
as cycles, processes, or controls.
216
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

SarbOxPro’s data tree breaks down like so:
 A cycle can have multiple processes under it.
 A process usually has only one transaction under it, but a transaction
can have one or more objectives listed under it.

 An objective can have one or more broad risks.
 A broad risk can break down into one or more subrisks.
 A risk can have one or more controls under it.
 A control usually has only one test under it.
SarbOxPro stages
The process of documenting Section 404 compliance involves three main task
categories, which are represented on the main SarbOxPro screen shown in
Figure 15-6. (From this main screen, documenters can access other areas of
the program.) The categories are:
 Initial Configuration: In this area of the program, documenters add infor-
mation about the company and its accounts. Users input information
about the entities being reported upon, import the company’s trial bal-
ance, and identify processes, employees, and other objectives as well as
levels of materiality and other criteria to be used in the testing.
 Data Entry: In this area, documenters identify specific information about
testing and other data gathered during the course of the Section 404
compliance process.
 Reports: This section of the program allows management and other
users to view summaries of data gathered as a result of Section 404 
compliance testing and interpret the data to make decisions about 
certifications and changes in the company’s controls.
Each of these task categories is discussed in more detail in the following 
sections.

Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

Doing the initial configuration
The makers of SarbOxPro recognize that it’s impossible for an organization to
test every single process and control and that in order for companies to
figure out which processes to test, they need some standard for deciding the
importance (materiality) of the processes. At a minimum, software should ini-
tially be configured to document the following:
 The most significant locations (parents, subsidiaries, branches, and so
on) where the company’s business is transacted
 The processes within each location that cause financial transactions to
be recorded in the trial balance
 The risks in each process
 The controls that prevent the risks from happening
 The tests to ensure the controls are in place
Figure 15-7 shows the main screen of the SarbOxPro software program. It’s
designed to help company employees (rather than costly outside consul-
tants) compile the following data:
 Entities and locations: SarbOxPro allows users to identify different com-
pany entities and locations using the screens like the one shown in
Figure 15-8.
SarbOxPro lets you create the equivalent of a standardized template for
controls that are constant from location to location. This action simpli-
fies the process of documenting controls at each location.

Chapter 15: Working with Some Actual SOX Software

 Trial balance: Most accounting programs allow you to create docu-
ments using an Excel format, so with this part of the program, users can
import a trial balance into SarbOxPro from Microsoft Excel.
 IT applications: Many companies lose track of their IT applications, so
SarbOxPro helps users document all the different information technol-
ogy applications in a company. The program makes it easy to maintain a
centralized listing.
 Materiality scoring: A section of the program allows management and
process owners to specify percentages to use to decide whether an
account or test result is considered “insignificant,” “material,” or “criti-
cal” (with a few levels in between those criteria).
 Employees: It’s important to know which employees are involved in car-
rying out process testing in case questions about the testing arise in the
future. SarbOxPro maintains a database of employee information as well.
 Processes: After your company develops a list of its processes, you can
begin creating a SarbOxPro database using the screen shown in Figure
15-9. SarbOxPro runs on Microsoft Access and is designed to ensure that
processes are named using consistent conventions so that they aren’t
mistakenly listed and tested more than once or overlooked by all the
documenters spread across all the locations in a typical Sox 404 project.
 Controls: As with processes, SarbOxPro ensures that controls are
named using consistent conventions to prevent them from being tested
repeatedly or overlooked. The program also has a rich library of identi-
fied control types that can be selected and correlated to the company’s
processes, as shown in Figure 15-10. Users who attempt to add duplicate
or nonstandard controls to the library receive a warning message.

220
Part IV: Software for SOX Techies 

 Assertions: Assertions are representations on the financial statements
that must be tested to determine if they’re true. SarbOxPro uses a spe-
cial screen shown to categorize and identify the types of assertions a
company makes, each of which must be separately tested.

Chapter 15: Working with Some Actual SOX Software

 Control stages: Control testing is an ongoing process that’s completed in
stages. SarbOxPro continuously documents the status of the testing.
 Frequency of controls: SarbOxPro allows you to document how often
your company tests its controls.
Entering all that testing process data
After you enter the initial configuration data discussed in the preceding sec-
tion, SarbOxPro allows you to enter the data you gather from your Section
404 internal compliance testing. Figure 15-11 illustrates the process of enter-
ing test data into SarbOxPro.
Creating reports
The best feature of a program like SarbOxPro is that it allows you to get
reports about test results at any time during the Section 404 audit using a
variety of filtering criteria, as shown in Figure 15-12. You can export data to
Excel to create your own reports or use the preformatted reports offered by
the SarbOxPro program. You can also create customized Microsoft
Access–based reports to meet specific company requirements.
Reports are a critical management tool because they summarize the data on
which management relies on personally certifying the company’s financial
statements under Sections 302 and 906 (discussed in Chapter 9).

Opting for Other Types 
of Software Solutions
Small companies looking for something even simpler than the popular
SarbOxPro program may opt for a general information management system
used to gather information other than that which is required by SOX. Web-
based solutions are also available. This section explains these types of 
products and examines a couple representative examples.
Looking at a general information 
management tool
kManager is an example of a software system that has broad-based IT func-
tionality for managing information within a company. SOX compliance is just
one aspect of this program.
You can download a demo of this company’s software at www.kmanager.com.
A diagram of the program architecture and functions is shown in Figure 15-13,
and some of kManager’s SOX-specific features are shown in Figure 15-14.
As of this writing, you can implement the kManager system for about $50 a
month.

Using Web-based compliance tools
Web-based SOX products can be a particularly easy-to-implement solution for
small companies. An example of such a product is Complyant (www.com-
plyant.com). Complyant provides Web-based templates (such as the one
shown in Figure 15-15) for entering information, and content databases.
Behind the templates is a relational database that allows the company to
create reports on information entered.
Complyant runs on the user’s browser software and on a .net framework and
SQL server database. All users within must have IDs and passwords in order
to access the company’s Complyant system.
Web-based SOX solutions like Complyant offer a number of advantages to
users:
 Compatibility with existing desktop applications: Complyant is designed
so that everyone in the company can access the tool from their desktops.
 Less paperwork: With a Web-based tool, employees have fewer docu-
ments and databases to manage internally.
 Ease of updating: These types of systems require no downloads or
upgrades; updating is all done by the company offering the Web-based
tool.

M
any companies are motivated to comply with SOX out of a sense of
social responsibility, but most do it to avoid being sanctioned, sued, or
even criminally prosecuted. In the first few years following its enactment, it
appears that SOX hasn’t been the boon for securities litigators that it has
proven to be for auditors. However, it is having an impact on the litigation
process. According to the National Economic Research Association (NERA),
since the passage of SOX, at least nine settlements of major securities lawsuits
have incorporated SOX reforms, including cases involving HCA Inc. and Sprint.
This chapter examines some of the criminal and civil trials played out in the
media after SOX. I update you on the aftermath of the Arthur Andersen crimi-
nal case and I then explain how recent case law limits the rights of private indi-
viduals to bring their own civil suits under SOX. Finally, I look at how SOX’s
whistle-blower provisions are impacting the nation’s workplaces. As of this
writing, the big winners in the courtroom and in the media are one high-profile
CEO, the big four accounting firms, and a few assorted whistle-blowers.
The Smoking Gun: Knowledge
The most unnerving potential work scenario for any chief executive or finan-
cial officers (CEOs and CFOs) of a corporation is the prospect of being sued
as an individual. After SOX, we’ve seen criminal trials against former powerful
top management figures as a result of the SOX requirements that they person-
ally certify the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. SOX Sections
302 and 906, which contain these requirements, are discussed in detail in
Chapter 9.

Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco management have received decades-long prison
sentences and massive fines as they attempt to defend their roles in massive
corporate collapses. Only one, CEO Richard Scrushy of HealthSouth
Corporation, discussed later in this chapter, has been acquitted so far.
SOX Sections 302 and 906 both attempt to create a legal link between chief
executive and financial officers (CEOs and CFOs) and the financial statements
put out by their companies by requiring that CEOs and CFOs personally 
certify their companies’ financial statements. Both sections impose harsh
penalties:
 SOX Section 906 authorizes a prison term of up to ten years and a fine of
up to $1 million for any executive who “knowingly” certifies a regulatory
filing that doesn’t “fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
condition and results” of the company. Any executive who willfully certi-
fies a false filing faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine.
(Willfully is a legal standard predicated on deliberate conduct.)
 Section 302 contains civil penalties for signing false reports. It provides
that the signing officer must certify that he or she has reviewed the
report and that, based on his or her knowledge, the financial statements
fairly represent the company’s operations.
Harsh as the requirement that CEOs and CFOs personally certify their com-
pany’s financial statements may have sounded when the law was first passed,
liability under both sections is predicated on what the CEOs and CFOs actu-
ally know. This legal standard means that at least one CEO (Richard Scrushy,
as discussed later) was able to successfully defend against criminal charges
by claiming that his subordinates pulled the wool over his eyes.
It is a demoralizing prospect to prosecutors that high-level management may
walk out of criminal courtrooms as free men and women while employees
who claimed to have taken direction from them are convicted. Accordingly,
the prosecutors are likely to revamp their strategies and attempt to shift 
the courtroom focus from what CEOs and CFOs actually knew to what they
should have known.
The First Big SOX Trial: Richard Scrushy
Top executives across the country were riveted in 2005 by coverage of the
trial of Richard Scrushy, one of the first CEOs to be prosecuted under SOX.
Under SOX Section 906, the prosecution had to prove that Scrushy acted will-
fully in order to convict him. Legal analysts are still debating exactly what
willfully means under Section 906, but most lawyers seem to concur that it
requires clearly knowing what was happening and either participating or
deliberately not preventing it.
230
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

The squishy Scrushy facts
In early 2005, Richard Scrushy, the former CEO of HealthSouth Corporation,
was prosecuted for SOX-related violations tied to HealthSouth’s downfall.
Scrushy was indicted on 36 criminal counts, including charges of criminal
conspiracy, securities fraud, wire and mail fraud, false statements, false certi-
fication under SOX Section 906, and money laundering.
Scrushy was a former respiratory therapist who cofounded HealthSouth 
in 1984 and built it into a national chain of rehabilitation and outpatient
surgery hospitals. At issue in the lawsuit was an alleged scheme to inflate
HealthSouth’s earnings by $2.7 billion from 1996 to 2002. Prosecutors con-
tended Scrushy personally amassed more than $200 million as the price 
of HealthSouth’s stock rose based on fraudulent financial reports. They
argued that HealthSouth was precisely an Enron-type scenario that SOX 
was created to prevent.
The prosecution had persuasive evidence against Scrushy as compared to the
cases against former top executives at WorldCom, Adelphia Communications,
and Tyco International. The case was viewed as strong for the following 
reasons:
 Five former company CFOs pleaded guilty to fraud and implicated their
former boss.
 The jury heard recorded conversations between Mr. Scrushy and a CFO
in which they discussed balance-sheet problems. (During the conversa-
tion, Scrushy asked, “You’re not wired, are you?”)
 Aaron Beam, the former CFO at HealthSouth, claimed Scrushy had direct
knowledge of accounting fraud at the company.
The Scrushy trial lasted four months and centered on testimony of the five
former CFOs who cooperated with the government by pointing fingers at
Scrushy and pled guilty to various charges. As in other CEO trials, lawyers
argued Scrushy was a victim of a conspiracy by his subordinates and
unaware that fraud was perpetuated by those beneath him.
The judge in the case carefully instructed the jury not to assume that
Scrushy was responsible for the fraud just because he was the CEO. However,
she also instructed the jury they could find Scrushy guilty if he “deliberately
closed his eyes” to wrongdoing. Ultimately, on July 1, 2005, Scrushy was
acquitted on all 36 charges that he signed false financial filings. One juror
observed after the trial, “As for evidence, I wanted something in black and
white, something like fingerprints. That wasn’t there.”

Chapter 16: Lawsuits Under SOX

The Scrushy post-game recap
Congress intended, after Enron and the wave of corporate scandals that fol-
lowed it, that the certification requirement would make it easier to prosecute
white-collar crimes. Even if other elements of a fraud weren’t linked to the
executive, the signing of a false affidavit would serve as a smoking gun. But
that’s not quite how things have worked out. However, as the Scrushy trial
indicates, convicting an executive of knowingly violating the certification
requirement involves proving the same facts necessary to support other
criminal charges that were on the books long before SOX. In the end, all that
appears certain is that SOX increases possible prison time.
The crucial element of SOX Section 906 is knowledge. Proving what an execu-
tive knew or didn’t know of a fraud in a large, publicly traded company with
thousands of employees is a huge prosecutorial undertaking.
In addition to charging Richard Scrushy under SOX Section 906, prosecutors
brought charges against him for securities fraud and conspiracy. In post-trial
interviews, jurors revealed that after they failed to find Scrushy guilty of the
non-SOX charges, the SOX-related counts fell like dominoes. A prominent
securities attorney quoted in The New York Times surmised, “I can’t imagine a
case where you couldn’t prove that the person had engaged in fraud, so you
found them not guilty on that count, but then found him guilty” for certifying
false filings [under SOX].”
Of the failure to get a conviction against Scrushy, the lead prosecutor in the
case said, “I don’t think it says anything on the strength of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act.” She observed that SOX “was just one of several federal statutes
that was used. It will be tested again.”
Questions raised by the Scrushy trial regarding executives’ behavior include:
 Is recklessly disregarding information the same as “knowing”?
 Do company executives have a duty to inquire about all ongoing finan-
cial matters?
 To what extent do executives have a duty to supervise subordinates and
verify their actions?
In the end, many lawyers have concluded that the liability that top executives
face under SOX may not be all that different from that which they faced under
criminal and securities laws prior to SOX.
What’s next: Scrushy civil suits
Although he was acquitted on all 36 criminal charges, Scrushy still faces civil
suits from HealthSouth’s shareholders. (The shares reached a high of just
232
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

above $30 in April 1998 only to plummet to 10 cents a share after the fraud
became public in March 2003.)
Mister Scrushy remains one of HealthSouth’s biggest shareholders. However,
the company has predictably sought to distance itself from its embattled
CEO. “The new board and new management team remain appalled by the
multibillion-dollar fraud that took place under Mr. Scrushy’s management and
environment under which such fraud could occur,” HealthSouth officials said
in a public statement. “Under no circumstances will Mr. Scrushy be offered
any position within the company by this management team or by this board
of directors.”
The “Ignorance” Defense of Kenneth Lay
In the fall of 2005, the Justice Department and Securities Exchange Commission
(SEC) finally brought charges against Enron’s former CEO, Kenneth Lay. Many
Enron officials (and even Lea Fastow, one official’s wife) were already tried, sen-
tenced, and had begun serving time for their roles in Enron’s collapse. Still,
government agencies continued to ponder whether to indict Mister Lay. The
delay, it appears, was attributable to that tricky issue of knowledge: What did
Mister Lay know — or not know — about the fraud being perpetrated at Enron
while he was at the helm? The Justice Department, after consternating for
years, finally opted to indict Lay for covering up Enron’s fraud (beginning in
2001). The SEC filed a corresponding civil suit.
Both government agencies appeared convinced. Lay didn’t initially know of
the fraud that brought his company down. Neither agency indicted Lay for
organizing the fraud or even knowing that the books were being cooked in
1999 and 2000.
These are the factors that persuaded the Justice Department to finally 
indict Lay:
 As he was reassuring Enron employees that the company would be
saved, he was secretly selling off his own shares of company stock. He
used what’s now known as the Lay loophole in federal securities, which
provided that stock transactions between an executive and the company
itself didn’t have to be disclosed until the following year.
SOX slams the Lay loophole closed by requiring that all insider transac-
tions be disclosed within days of taking place.
 He repeatedly borrowed $4 million from the company and then satis-
fied the loan by tendering stock to the company.
SOX now prohibits corporations from making loans to their executives.
233
Chapter 16: Lawsuits Under SOX

In the civil suit filed by the SEC, the agency alleged Lay violated insider-trading
laws by selling stock when he knew of the fraud in 2001, but not prior to that.
In fact, the only crime that Lay’s alleged to have committed prior to 2001 is
failing to disclose to lending banks that money he was borrowing would be
used to purchase Enron shares.
Some observers have speculated that the delay in indicting Lay signaled a
weak case. They infer that because Lay was the face of Enron, the prosecu-
tors’ goal was to get any indictment.
President Bush once publicly called Kenneth Lay “Kenny Boy.” The media
seized upon this to assert Lay’s supposed connections to the Bush adminis-
tration, inspiring political jibes like the ballad Oh Kenny Boy, reprinted in 
the sidebar.
In late August 2001, Lay deflected a reporter’s question about the partnerships
used to shelter Enron losses, and these off–balance sheet losses became sym-
bolic of Enron’s fraud. “You’re getting way over my head,” Lay told the reporter,
despite the fact that he held a PhD in economics.
As of this writing, the public has professed shock that Lay may walk free 
even though those Enron officers under his direction went to prison. The
inescapable conclusion of this case is that it’s difficult to prove what a CEO
knew and didn’t know at the time fraud occurred. The question of knowledge

Oh Kenny Boy . . .
The following ballad is sung to the tune of
“Danny Boy”:
Oh Kenny Boy, the jails, the jails are calling,
From state to state, and through the world so
wide.
The money’s gone, and all the chips are falling,
’Tis you, ’tis you must go and you must hide.
But come ye back when lawmen stop their
yam’ring,
Or when Congress is hushed and Dems are
eating crow.
’Tis I’ll be there in office or in Crawford,
Oh Kenny Boy, oh Kenny Boy, I love you so.
But if you’re jailed, and I am in the Oval,
If I’m still Prez, as Prez I expect to be,
Don’t come and ask for favors or a pardon,
Don’t kneel and say a rescue plea to me.
For I shan’t hear, tho’ loud you beg before me,
Though all I craved you gladly gave to me.
You’ll have to fend without me if you love me,
And you will keep your peace, so I stay Prez
and free

will continue to be the critical burden of proof under SOX Sections 302 and
906. These sections (discussed in Chapter 9) now require CEOs and CFOs to
personally sign off on their companies’ financial statements, something Mr.
Lay wasn’t required to do prior to SOX.
Timing Is Everything: Andersen, Ernst,
and KPMG Litigation Outcomes
In 2001, Arthur Andersen was the largest accounting firm in the world with
28,000 employees in the U.S. alone. By 2002, it had collapsed under a criminal
indictment.
Prior to Anderson’s demise, there were only five major firms (the “Big Five”)
with the capability to audit the largest U.S. firms. The availability of sophisti-
cated audit service providers for large firms was suddenly constricted.
Concerns surfaced about the future quality of accounting professionals in 
the workplace since Arthur Andersen had been the training ground for the
CPA profession. Thousands lost their jobs.
In 2005, KPMG, one of the remaining the “Big Four” firms, came very close to
suffering the same fate as Andersen for peddling illegal tax shelters. However,
with KPMG, the Justice Department proceeded carefully; it didn’t want its
indictment to put the KPMG under and shrink the number of major account-
ing firms to the “Big Three.”
William McDonough, head of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB), publicly expressed relief in September 2005 that the Department of
Justice had reached a settlement with KPMG over its past sales of tax avoid-
ance schemes to clients. As of this writing, the remaining Big Four firms are
Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The
public has a sense that all of the Big Four remain vulnerable in the market-
place to scandal and litigation at any time.
PCAOB Chairman McDonough has warned that the solution to the problem of
audit concentration can’t be solved by a merger of smaller accounting firms.
Even if the firms ranked five through eight were all merged into one, the
resulting company would still be far smaller and less capable of doing large-
scale audits than any of the Big Four.
“None of us has a clue what to do if one of the big four failed,” McDonough
told the press in 2005. He explained that if even one of the big four accounting
firms was to collapse, the best accountants would likely flee from the profes-
sion to seek better opportunities in other fields. Other experts point out that
competition in the industry would be severely diminished, and fees for public
companies already socked by SOX compliance costs would skyrocket.
235
Chapter 16: Lawsuits Under SOX

Moreover, the possibility of losing a major accounting firm raises a question of
whether enough high-quality, experienced firms would be available to perform
the complex public company audits that the U.S. economy and the investing
public depend upon.
Andersen’s victory: Three years too late
In June 2002, Andersen was convicted of a single count of obstruction of jus-
tice, which was enough to precipitate the accounting giant’s downfall. The
count alleged Anderson deliberately shredded Enron documents in order to
thwart a pending investigation.
This was only one of the many misdeeds that came to light after the collapse
of Enron, as discussed in Chapter 2.
A member of the firm sent a memo allegedly advocating shredding as part of
the firm’s “document retention policy.” Those involved in the Enron audit
were all too eager to comply. The company defended its document retention
policy as necessary financial housekeeping and denied the shredding was
intended to block a future investigation.
On May 31, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Arthur Andersen’s con-
viction; in a unanimous opinion, the nine justices on the high court con-
cluded the “jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite
consciousness of wrongdoing.” Chief Justice William Rehnquist admonished,
“Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.”
Unfortunately, at the time that the Supreme Court overturned its conviction,
Andersen was nearly defunct, with only about 200 employees left (most of
whom handled its ongoing legal matters). Its downfall had an economic
ripple effect. Not only were about 28,000 Andersen employees thrown out of
work, but substantial jobs were lost in companies that provided goods and
services to Andersen. The Andersen downfall also served to restrict competi-
tion and drive up audit fees just as most public companies were experiencing
the initial sticker shock of SOX compliance.
An Ernst error
In the fall of 2005, the SEC chief administrative law judge Brenda Murray
ruled that accounting firm Ernst & Young acted improperly by auditing
PeopleSoft Inc., a huge public company with which the firm had a profitable
relationship in other business areas. Because of the SEC’s contention that
Ernst had violated rules on auditor independence, Judge Murray entered an
unusual order barring Ernst from accepting new audit clients in the United
States for six months. She also fined the firm $1.7 million.
236
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

The SEC contended Ernst had violated rules on auditor independence
because of its profitable relationship with PeopleSoft Inc. in other business
areas.
Ernst’s consulting and tax practices used PeopleSoft software in their busi-
ness, and the two companies collaborated in promoting some of their joint
business activities. The evidence in the SEC’s case revealed that
 Ernst had billed itself in marketing materials as an “implementation part-
ner” of PeopleSoft.
 Ernst had earned $500 million over five years from installing PeopleSoft
programs at other companies.
SEC officials said the decision against Ernst & Young would send a message
to other firms that, “auditor independence is one of the centerpieces of
ensuring the integrity of the audit process.”
Ernst ties with its competitor, KPMG, for receiving the longest suspension of
signing new clients ever imposed by the SEC. In 1975, Peat Marwick, a prede-
cessor of KPMG, received a similar six-month suspension for failing to audit
five companies, one of which was Penn Central, a railroad that subsequently
went bankrupt.
Kid gloves for KPMG?
In 2005, in a case described as the largest tax evasion scheme in U.S. history,
the Justice Department criminally charged eight former executives of the
major accounting firm KPMG with conspiracy to sell fraudulent tax shelters
that shorted the IRS at least $2.5 billion.
According to prosecutors, the firm earned around $115 million in fees for sell-
ing illegal tax shelters over a seven-year period. Court documents described
the shelters “as a means for wealthy individuals with taxable income or gains
generally in excess of $10 million in 1996 and of $20 million in 1998–2000
fraudulently to eliminate or reduce the tax paid to the IRS on that income or
gain.” KPMG received a $456 million fine to settle the federal investigation of
its marketing of the illegal tax shelters.
Although KPMG as an entity was charged with conspiracy in a criminal com-
plaint, the firm was granted something referred to as deferred prosecution.
Basically, deferred prosecution means that the Justice Department made a
decision not to prosecute the firm; it allowed KPMG to avoid a grand jury crimi-
nal indictment by paying the penalty, submitting to some independent monitor-
ing, and continuing to cooperate with the Justice Department investigation.
237
Chapter 16: Lawsuits Under SOX

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales defended the government’s decision to
defer prosecution, but in the minds of many, the decision sent a message that
prosecution is risky because there are simply too few big accounting firms,
and the Justice Department didn’t want to set in motion an Andersen-esque
demise for KMPG. Gonzalez publicly stated: “I want to be clear. No company
is too big to be prosecuted. We have zero tolerance for corporate fraud, but
we also recognize the importance of avoiding collateral consequences when-
ever possible.” Gonzales also pointed out the range of potential economic
victims from the possible fallout of a KPMG downfall; Gonzalez explained that
the Justice Department’s decision reflected “the reality that the conviction of
an organization can affect innocent workers and others associated with the
organization, and can even have an impact on the national economy.”
While deferring to prosecute KPMG, federal prosecutors had no such reserva-
tions indicting individuals associated with the scandal. In August 2005, the
Justice Department indicted eight former KPMG LLP officials and a lawyer
accused of helping wealthy clients evade billions of dollars in taxes. It’s the
largest criminal tax fraud case in history.
The Gemstar Case: Interpreting 
Section 1103
SOX Section 1103 is a provision directed at recouping big bonuses paid to
fraudulent executives. The statute kicks into effect if a company is being
investigated for a possible violation of federal securities laws and it appears
to the SEC “likely” that the company will make “extraordinary payments
(whether compensation or otherwise).” Under the statute, the SEC may ask a
federal district court for a temporary order requiring the issuer to hold the
fund in a special interest-bearing account (called an escrow account) for 45
days. If the individual slated to receive the supposed “extraordinary pay-
ments” actually is charged with a securities violation in a civil proceeding, a
court can withhold the payments until the end of the trial.
Because neither SOX Section 1103 nor any SEC rule defines an “extraordinary
payment,” courts have begun to look at this issue. For example, in May 2005,
a three-judge panel ruled that multimillion dollar termination fees to be paid
to two executives of Gemstar after the company discovered that it had over-
stated its revenue by millions of dollars were not extraordinary. The panel in
this case noted the lack of “evidence as to what would be an ordinary pay-
ment under comparable circumstances.”
238
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

In the Gemstar case, the district court had placed the funds in escrow, but its
logic was vague in that it had relied, in part, on the fact that the payments at
issue had been negotiated over a long period of time by many different
people in the company. The district court called this process extraordinary,
but the appeals court said the circumstances didn’t constitute that label and
complained it hadn’t received enough evidence from the lower (district)
court to review the case on appeal and had no choice but to reverse the dis-
trict court’s ruling.
Suing Under SOX Section 304
SOX Section 304 calls for disgorgement of profits and bonuses from top corpo-
rate executives in the wake of an alleged accounting scandal. (Disgorgement
is an odd word choice that simply means they have to give it back.)
Who can sue officers and directors to disgorge their bonuses? According to 
a recent federal district court case, only the SEC can. In Neer v. Pelino, the
court held that SOX doesn’t provide a private right of action for shareholders
to file a suit on their own behalf. (This type of lawsuit is known as a share-
holders’ derivative suit.)
The Court held that Congress intended for Section 304 to be enforced only by
the SEC, and not by shareholders in private lawsuits. The judge reasoned that
Congress “explicitly created a private right of action in only one place, and
that is in Section 306” — a provision that prohibits corporate officers from
buying or selling securities during a pension fund blackout period. (Blackout
periods are covered in Chapter 10.)
Suing Under Section 806: The 
Whistle-Blower Provision
Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 confers public company
employees who report suspected violations of a range of federal offenses the
right to sue both the company and its employees and agents for reinstate-
ment and back pay.
239
Chapter 16: Lawsuits Under SOX

Blowing the whistle before and after SOX
Whistle-blowers, employees who lawfully disclose private employer informa-
tion, have been the heart and soul of many federal fraud cases against many
well-known companies. Prior to SOX, most of these types of complaints were
brought under the False Claims Act, which encourages whistle-blowers to
come forward by promising them up to 25 percent of the money recovered by
the government as a result of the shared information. The act was first
passed during the Civil War but was resurrected and amended in 1985. Since
then, it has generated $12 billion for the federal treasury (and more than $1
billion for hundreds of whistle-blowers).
The decades-old False Claims Act gives whistle-blowers a reward of up to 25
percent of the funds recovered. SOX offers additional whistle-blower protec-
tions to those who help uncover fraud against publicly traded companies.
Specifically, SOX
 Protects whistle-blowers from being fired.
 Provides remedies for whistle-blower reinstatement.
What happens when the whistle blows?
Under SOX, a whistle-blower is an employee who provides information to a
federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, to a member or committee of
Congress, or to a person with supervisory authority over the employee about
conduct that the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of:
 Any rule or regulation of the SEC
 Federal criminal provisions relating to securities
 Bank, mail, or wire fraud
 Any other federal law relating to fraud against company’s shareholders
SOX Section 806, which is enforced by the federal Occupational Health and
Safety Administration (OSHA), declares that officers, employees, contractors,
subcontractors, and agents of the company are forbidden to engage in any
retaliation against a whistle-blower.
According to OSHA, the protection of Section 806 extends not only to employ-
ees, but also to the employees of contractors, subcontractors, and agents of
public companies.
240
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

Filing the complaint
If an employee believes he or she has been fired, demoted, suspended,
threatened, harassed, coerced, or put on any sort of blacklist because of
whistle-blowing, he or she can file a complaint with OSHA within 90 days of
the alleged discriminatory treatment. After OSHA receives the complaint, the
agency notifies the employer of the allegations and evidence and gives it an
opportunity to respond. The Secretary of Labor issues its decision within 180
days of the filing of the complaint.
OSHA’s review of the complaint
OSHA conducts an initial review of each SOX-related whistle-blower com-
plaint and decides whether the employee filing the complaint makes the
required basic case (called a prima facie case) against the employer. The
required elements for a prima facie case are:
 Protected activity: The employee engaged in conduct or an activity that
was protected by SOX or another law.
 Employer knowledge: Either actually or constructively, the employer
knew or suspected that the employee engaged in the protected activity.
 Unfavorable action by employer: The employee suffered an unfavorable
personnel action, such as termination, demotion, or suspension.
 Sufficient circumstances: The circumstances must raise the inference
that the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable
action.
Whether the employer actually violated the specified SOX laws and regula-
tions isn’t important. All that’s required for a valid Section 806 complaint is
that the employee have an objectively reasonable belief that the employer’s
conduct constitutes such a violation for the employee to be protected under
Section 806.
241
Chapter 16: Lawsuits Under SOX
Windfalls for whistle-blowers
Several years before SOX, hospital CFO Jim
Alderson refused to go along with his
employer’s phony billing practices and was let
go. Alderson sued for wrongful discharge and
alerted the government to the fact that it was
being cheated out of $1.7 billion in Medicare
funds by the nation’s largest commercial hospi-
tal chain. Under the False Claims Act, Mr.
Alderson received a 10-percent share of the
money recovered by the government.

OSHA’s investigation
If OSHA finds that the complainant has the elements for a prima facie case (as
explained in the preceding section), the employer is given 20 days to respond
after it receives notice of the complaint filing. The employer can respond in
writing or request a personal meeting with OSHA; it’s required to demon-
strate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same
personnel action even in the absence of the employee’s whistle-blowing activ-
ity. If OSHA finds that the employer has met this burden, it dismisses the
complaint. Otherwise, OSHA must conduct a formal investigation into the
merits of the complaint.
OSHA takes the position that an employer’s company counsel doesn’t have
the right to be present during interviews of nonmanagement and nonsupervi-
sory personnel. In fact, as a matter of practice, OSHA often doesn’t notify the
company or its lawyers when such employees are contacted in the course of
an investigation. OSHA also redacts witness statements or summarizes them
to protect employees who ask to remain anonymous.
After OSHA finishes its investigation, it decides whether there’s reasonable
cause to believe the company violated Section 806 by discriminating against
the whistle-blower. If it sides with the employee, OSHA’s order may include
reinstatement or coverage of lost pay. The employer has an opportunity to
submit a written response or to meet with the investigators to interview
more witnesses and submit evidence within ten business days of OSHA’s 
notification to the employer.
Dealing with appeals
If either party disagrees with OSHA’s findings, it may file an appeal with the
Chief Administrative Law Judge in the Department of Labor. If neither party
appeals within 30 days of receiving OSHA’s findings, the preliminary order
becomes the final decision of the Secretary of Labor, and no further judicial
review is allowed.
If an appeal crops up within 30 days, an administrative law judge conducts a
new hearing on the complaint. The administrative law judge’s order may be
appealed to the Department of Labor’s Administrative Review Board. A peti-
tion for review must be filed within ten business days of the administrative
law judge’s decision, and review by the board is discretionary. Unless the
board accepts the case within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review,
the administrative law judge’s decision becomes final. It may be appealed to
the United States Court of Appeals.
242
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

As of this writing, the Department of Labor has reported approximately five
dozen cases that have been appealed or considered by administrative law
judges. Most have been dismissed for untimely filing or withdrawn, signaling
settlement without reaching a decision on the legal merits of the case.
Tips for defending against 
whistle-blower suits
Whistle-blower complaints in the post-SOX era require more attention and
certainly more paperwork than before. No matter how unfounded the com-
plaint may seem, your company can practice safe SOX by doing the following:
 Take all complaints seriously. Make sure that all complaints brought by
employees are fully investigated and documented. Employees should be
instructed on procedures for processing complaints and directed never
to make a determination that the complaint is trivial or frivolous.
 Track the timing. If an employee is contentious and requires discipline,
try to delay taking any action until his or her complaint is investigated.
The mere coincidence of timing may lead to an inference that the com-
pany fired the employee in retaliation for the whistle-blower complaint.
 Document every phase of the investigation. Document the complaint
itself, everyone who is made aware of it, information gathered that’s rel-
evant to the outcome of the complaint, action taken in response to the
complaint (if any), and how the matter is concluded.

In This Chapter

 Considering how SOX impacts not-for-profit companies
 Looking at how foreign companies are responding to SOX
T
his chapter explores the outer limits of SOX, taking a look at its surpris-
ingly broad scope. Congress probably didn’t consider the impact passing
SOX would have on outsourced services, not-for-profit organizations, and for-
eign corporations. Nevertheless, these types of entities are being impacted
by the pervasive standards introduced by SOX.
In this chapter, I examine a company’s obligations with respect to the work it
sends out beyond its four walls. I also look at the guidance SOX offers to not-
for-profits as they struggle with their own governance issues. Finally, I take
you across the ocean to understand how SOX impacts European companies
that list their stock on U.S. exchanges.
Outsourcing Under SOX
SOX Section 404 requires companies to assess and audit the effectiveness of
their internal control and how they impact the companies’ financial state-
ments. (Internal control is discussed in Chapter 11.) This requirement
extends to all aspects of a company’s financial operations — even if some of
them happen to occur outside the company.
If your company relies on outside companies to process financial informa-
tion, it must make sure adequate internal controls are in place just as if the
company had done the work in-house. SOX requires companies to monitor
control conditions at facilities where they outsource services and at hosting
sites where they may store sensitive company data.

The responsibility for monitoring internal control for outsourced services
arises from SAS 70, an auditing standard developed by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (discussed in Chapter 5). This document con-
tains audit requirements for the control activities a company puts in place at
a service organization or outsourcing firm.
Summarizing SAS 70
Under SAS 70, an audit of internal control for outsourced services can be per-
formed by the service provider’s auditors or by the company relying on its
work. SAS 70 identifies two types of audit approaches:
 Type 1 audit: Focuses on general controls at one point in time. This type
of audit is a “snapshot” approach that doesn’t involve audit testing.
 Type 2 audit: Looks at control conditions over a designated period of
time. Auditors conduct tests that span this time period and perform
testing to verify the effectiveness of controls at service organizations.
Regardless of the type of audit approach chosen by the audit firm, the com-
pany’s audit committee must work with the audit committee to make sure
that the SAS 70 report generated is adequate to address the requirements of
Section 404 (discussed in Chapter 11). The issues that must be addressed
include the following:
 Scope: It’s up to the company and the service provider to determine the
scope of the audit and what will be tested. Ultimately, the company’s
outside auditors are required to include an evaluation of this testing
within their overall Section 404 audit of the company.
 Lead time: Many service providers are just getting up to speed with
SOX. Smaller service providers who have until July 15, 2007, to comply
with SOX may need extra lead time to comply with SAS 70 requests. 
(For details on the SEC compliance deadlines, turn to Chapter 11.)
 Standardized certifications: Companies that provide outsourced service
may be able to save money and better service their clients by asking
their own outside audit firms to develop SAS 70 certifications that they
can provide to companies. Doing so meets the needs of their customers
in a proactive manner and helps the service provider avoid having to
reinvent the wheel each time a customer requests an SAS 70 certification.
(A sample SAS certification report is included in Appendix E.)
 Additional testing: After the SAS audit results come back, additional
testing may be required. Ultimately, the customer is responsible for the
testing.
246
Part V: To Sox-finity and Beyond 

Sidestepping SAS 70
Not all outsourced functions require SAS audits. Sensitive services, such as
payroll, may require your company to secure an SAS 70 audit. However, your
company may not need an SAS 70 from the following types of services
providers:
 Staffing: If you use a temporary agency to help staff your company’s IT
or accounting departments, you probably don’t need an SAS audit
because the sensitive services are performed internally.
 Software development: You probably don’t need an SAS 70 from a com-
pany to which you outsource application development activities if con-
trols are already in place within your company to monitor the quality of
the work.
 Law firms and other outside consultants: As with software develop-
ment, the quality of these services is monitored within your company,
so an SAS 70 certification probably isn’t required.
Extending SOX Principles 
to Not-for-Profits
Although SOX applies to publicly traded companies, not-for-profit companies
(NFPs) are becoming increasingly concerned about being sued and held to
judicially created standards akin to those found in SOX. For this reason, SOX
considerations are starting to surface in some unexpected places — school
boards, charities, and other tax-exempt organizations are seeking some level
of reform and accountability.
Altruism is not enough
Not-for-profits must be prepared to demonstrate a commitment to good gov-
ernance and internal control. Not-for-profits, as a rule, depend on public 
good will and their reputations to attract funds. Despite the most altruistic
motives, a financial scandal can permanently undermine an organization’s
ability to attract contributions. Thus, words such as “accountability,”
“ethics,” “transparency,” “duty,” “full-disclosure,” and “social responsibility”
have always been part of the vernacular of NFP governance — from the small-
est NFPs to the largest.
247
Chapter 17:  The Surprising Scope of SOX

Although the SOX doesn’t legally apply to NFPs, the statute has increased
public awareness as to how companies of all types govern themselves. NFPs
are likely to look to SOX for guidance in developing their own governance
standards. Audit committees, compensation committees, written codes of
ethics, and governance guidelines are all likely to find their way into NFPs.
Since SOX was proposed, several bills have been introduced in both federal
and state legislatures to make nonprofit corporations, municipal agencies,
and charitable groups more accountable. While this type of legislation is still
years away, SOX-type standards for NFPs are inevitable.
Proponents of holding not-for-profits to SOX standards cite scandals in school
districts, public colleges, and charities across the country. The IRS has already
contacted 2,000 tax-exempt organizations across the country to inquire about
their executive compensation.

Legislators are looking at nonprofit 
governance standards
In September 2004, Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Charles Grassley contacted the presi-
dent of a group called the Independent Sector
and asked it to convene an independent national
panel to make recommendations on issues of
governance, ethical practice, and accountability
for the nonprofit sector. As a result, the national
Panel on the Nonprofit Sector was named.
The panel made recommendations in 15 major
areas for actions to be taken by the nonprofits
themselves, by the IRS, and by Congress. At a
minimum, the panel recommended that all non-
profit organizations voluntarily:
 Adopt and implement a policy regulating
conflicts of interest.
 Include on their boards of directors individ-
uals with financial literacy skills (that is,
with experience reading and interpreting
financial statements and information).
 Develop policies regarding whistle-blowers
(which are people who report fraud and
mismanagement within an organization.
The whistle-blower provisions of SOX are
discussed in Chapter 16.
The panel also recommended the Congress and
the IRS take the following actions:
 Create rules to suspend the tax-exempt
status of any organization that fails to file
required annual Form 990 series returns
with the IRS for two or more consecutive
years after notice from the IRS.
 Require that CEOs (or other top manage-
ment) certify that their IRS Form 990 returns
are correct and complete.
 Require charitable organizations to conduct
an independent audit of their finances if
they must file a Form 990 return with the IRS
each year and have total annual revenues
of $2 million or more.
 Require that charities with $25,000 in annual
revenues complete an annual notice sup-
plying basic information.
You can locate the full text of the panel’s 
final report and recommendations at www.

NFPs aren’t immune to lawsuits, and it’s likely no NFP will want to risk being
sued without certain safeguards in place. Many SOX-sensitive attorneys and
accountants working for NFPs recommend that every NFP adopt most, if not
all, of the following SOX-type standards:
 Audit committee: The NFP should create an audit committee and sepa-
rate the function of that committee from the finance committee. As in
the private sector, the NFP’s audit committee should be composed of
board members who aren’t compensated for serving on the committee
and don’t have a financial interest or other conflict of interest with any
company or person doing business with the NFP.
 Outside consultants for the audit committee: Most nonprofit organiza-
tions have volunteer board members who may or may not be trained in
business and accounting principles. Therefore, it’s important that inde-
pendent, outside consultants, or other advisors be available to work
with the audit committee. (SOX mandates that audit committees be per-
mitted to hire outside consultants and that their companies be required
to pay for the consulting services.)
 Procedures for adopting the auditor’s report: The NFP audit committee
should meet with the outside audit firm and recommend to the full board
of directors whether the audit report should be approved or modified.
The full board should formally accept or reject the committee’s report.
 Auditor independence: SOX contains a number of requirements to
ensure the independence of outside auditors. For example, SOX requires
that audit firms rotate the lead partner every five years.
 Prohibited services: SOX prohibits the audit firm from providing certain
nonaudit services. Prohibited services include bookkeeping, financial
information systems, and other services (see Chapter 5 for a more com-
plete list). NFPs may be used to receiving these services from audit
firms. Consistent with the standards in SOX, an NFP’s audit committee
may, however, preapprove certain types nonaudit services outside 
these categories, such as tax preparation. Additionally, auditors may 
be allowed to prepare Form 990 or 990-PF (for private foundations) if
such services are preapproved.
 CEO/CFO certification: Like their counterparts in the private sector, the
NFP should consider having CEOs and CFOs certify both the appropri-
ateness of financial statements and the officers’ fair presentations of the
financial conditions and operations of their companies.
SOX and Foreign Companies
Under current law a company that wants to sell securities to the public in the
United States, listing those securities either on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) or the NASDAQ, must reconcile its financial statements to U.S.
accounting rules and comply with American securities laws, including SOX.
249
Chapter 17:  The Surprising Scope of SOX

European companies that do business in the U.S. are becoming increasingly
worried about the costs and restrictions of complying with SOX. Like U.S.
companies, European companies have found the Section 404 provisions
requiring attestation of internal controls to be the most burdensome, driving
up their costs and audit fees. The European companies also express concern
about SOX’s ban on company loans to executives. As a result, they’re mount-
ing overseas efforts to make it easier for them to flat out quit complying with
U.S. securities laws. Among these efforts, in 2005, 11 organizations represent-
ing 100,000 European companies sent a letter to the SEC chairman asking for
changes that would allow them to simply stop registering with the SEC.
A European company can delist from the U.S. exchanges, meaning that its stock
is no longer traded on the exchange (as discussed in Chapter 3). However, the
company is still subject to securities laws unless it proves it has fewer than 300
American investors. If the company is able to do this, it may have to resume
compliance with U.S. rules in the future if its American investor count passes
the 300 mark.
According to a December 2004 article, which appeared in BusinessWeek
Online, “the London Stock Exchange (LSE) is in discussions with a number 
of companies from China and Russia seeking refuge from U.S. regulation.” 
The BusinessWeek Online article also reported that the “British online-travel
group Lastminute and German software company Lion Bioscience already
have initiated the process to withdraw from U.S. stock exchanges.”
European companies have proposed that they be exempted from SEC regis-
tration if they delist and show that less than 5 percent of their total share vol-
umes are in the U.S. This proposal is likely to run into some opposition from
the SEC, however, for the following reasons:
 The arrangement could be considered akin to accepting lower interna-
tional standards in lieu of SOX.
 Foregoing SOX requirements for foreign companies could place U.S.
companies at a competitive disadvantage because of their relatively
higher compliance costs.
 Many American institutional investors would likely buy shares of compa-
nies that aren’t listed on U.S. exchanges from overseas exchanges.

ho is the SEC going to be looking at after Enron, WorldCom, Global
TelLink, and HealthSouth? Why did Tyco’s Dennis Koslowski get 20
years under the old SEC rules while James Scrushy, the first CEO to face pros-
ecution under SOX, left the court room a free man? How could Scrushy walk
while five of his subordinates pleaded guilty? How do you keep yourself, your
department, and your company out of the SOX spotlight? Can you spend your
bonus, or will you have to give it back if the company has a bad year?
You aren’t the only one asking these questions and many more. In this chap-
ter, I provide you with a few tips for keeping the litigators off your doorstep
and sleeping soundly after SOX.
Maintain an Active and 
Visible Audit Committee
Under SOX, every public company is required to have an audit committee
that interfaces with the company’s outside auditors. Many not-for-profit and
private companies are opting to establish audit committees as well because
they provide additional credibility for the audit process. The audit committee

is responsible for giving good information to the auditors and communicating
audit issues to management, so this is one committee you want to make
active, visible, and well funded in your company. (Flip to Chapter 7 for full
audit committee details.)
Communicate About How 
to Communicate
In the first major case to go to trial after SOX, James Scrushy, the CEO of the
teetering HealthSouth Corporation, was acquitted in July 2005 of 36 counts of
signing false financial filings. Scrushy claimed he didn’t know of the fraudu-
lent activity that sent the five HealthSouth subordinates who reported to him
to jail. (The Scrushy trial is recounted in Chapter 16.) As this lawsuit makes
clear, documented communication channels and visible networks can help
you and your company maintain credibility in a SOX-related investigation.
Documentation can help buttress testimony and jog memories.
Put policies in place to document how delegated work is supervised and how
results and conclusions are communicated. Policies will vary for every com-
pany and may even be different within particular departments. An employee
titles don’t always convey the actual level of supervisory responsibility a
position entails.
Combat Policy Paranoia and 
Section 404 Audit-Chondria
Communication is key under SOX (see the preceding section), but too much of
it can also be a bad thing. Policies that micromanage workflow and audit minu-
tiae can create their own red flags. For example, cynical attorneys may raise
questions about why trivial policies were flexibly applied, or future auditors
may demand discussion about why nonmaterial discrepancies weren’t further
investigated or why items from last year’s audit were dropped from this year’s
agenda. (For more information on surviving a Section 404 audit, turn to
Chapter 12.)
Under SOX, a company’s audit committee has the authority to hire indepen-
dent advisors, such as attorneys, to help write good policies and determine
how to handle audit issues. SOX-savvy attorneys can help the committee
254
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

adopt policies that contain an appropriate level of detail. Attorneys also can
act as good advocates when auditors propose resources reviewing poten-
tially irrelevant or nonmaterial issues or when issues arise about the scope 
of sensitive SOX-related projects under Section 404.
Policies that have ill-conceived phrasing or extraneous detail create the 
risk that the employees cannot literally comply with them and leave insuffi-
cient room for employees to exercise appropriate discretion in unforeseen
circumstances.
Keep Bonuses Within Bounds
During Enron, WorldCom, and other corporate scandals, the media had a field
day reporting on huge, questionable bonuses paid to executives of these fail-
ing corporations. In the post-SOX era, executive compensation has become a
politically sensitive issue.
Document how and why executive bonuses were awarded. Your company’s
compensation committee should have a market analysis on hand to support
that bonus amounts are in line in the event that they are later challenged. For
instance, questions may be raised in a lean year as to why big bonuses were
paid in a prior profitable one. (For a more detailed discussion of executive
compensation, turn to Chapter 10.)
Separate the Whistle-blowers 
from the Whiners
Whistle-blowers are employees who raise questions of fraud or noncompli-
ance with accounting or governmental regulations in the workplace. So that 
a serious and valid complaint doesn’t get glossed over and later return to
cause major lawsuit trouble for the company, every whistle-blower complaint
should be fully investigated and its disposition documented. Make sure that
levels of review are afforded to complaints based upon their seriousness and
credibility and that compliance with company policy is documented at every
level to determine which complaints may have hidden merit. (Chapter 16 
provides detailed information on avoiding and handling whistle-blower 
complaints.)
255
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Avoid Getting Sued or Criminally Prosecuted

Invest in IT Tools
Buying and using a sensible SOX software product is a good way to demon-
strate that your company is committed to strong internal controls and is
being systematic in its compliance. (Software solutions for companies of all
sizes are discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.)
If the software tool generates good reports and summaries, it’s easier to doc-
ument what people in the company knew for certification purposes (which I
discuss in Chapter 9).
Do Something with All That Data
Data gathered during a Section 404 audit should be evaluated according to a
stated policy and also should be shared with the audit committee, manage-
ment, and board of directors as appropriate.
It’s logical that many companies, having spent considerable resources to
comply with Section 404, don’t want to dedicate more resources to analyze
the data. Understandably, companies want to get back on track developing
core services and products. However, taking extra steps to parcel out the
data to relevant decision makers can provide valuable databases of company-
specific and current information on which to base future decisions affecting
their departments.
Be Attuned to Triggering Events
Within four days of their occurrence (and sometimes less), SOX requires
companies to disclose to the public (on Form 8-K) certain triggering events,
such as the termination of major contracts, new financial obligations, write-
offs, and financial restatements. Companies that don’t disclose these events
in a timely manner (as discussed in Chapter 3) risk both public sanctions and
private litigation.
Document What’s Delegated
Litigation under SOX has an increased focus on what management knew 
and what it was supposed to know. Under SOX, management is allowed to
256
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

delegate authority and even outsource certain types of decisions. It is not,
however, acceptable for management to take measures to insulate itself from
information as to how that authority is being carried out.
Delegation of authority was a key issue in the HealthSouth scandal, when
CEO Richard Scrushy walked free while five of his subordinates were con-
victed of fraud (as discussed in Chapter 16). Prosecutors and the public were
aghast and determined not to let many more slippery CEOs escape liability
under SOX by claiming they didn’t know what their subordinates were doing.
Focus on Product and Service Delivery
SOX is legislation aimed at protecting the public from false financial report-
ing. If your company’s credo is to focus on product and service delivery that
generates real growth, rather than on plumping up paper profits, your com-
pany will meet the objectives of SOX.

Ten Tips for an Effective 
Audit Committee
In This Chapter
 Identifying the right size for an audit committee
 Delegating to subcommittees
 Communicating with auditors and auditees
 Finding and funding financial experts
 Keeping qualified members
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) arms your company’s audit committee with
an arsenal of authority, including the ability to hire its own legal and
accounting advisors. This critical committee is the linchpin of corporate
accountability, serving as an essential interface between your company’s
management, auditors, employees, and board of directors.
Because the audit committee is so important, this chapter offers ten tips on
how to structure it to function most effectively.
Pick the Right Number of Members
Your company has plenty of leeway in deciding how many people should sit
on its audit committee. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules provide
that a committee must have a minimum of three members, but it doesn’t
place a limit on how large the committee can be. In fact, you can invite the
entire board of directors to join (provided they meet the financial indepen-
dence and other requirements discussed in Chapter 8).
Each member of the audit committee must also sit on the company’s board of
directors.

As a practical matter, putting your entire board of directors on the audit com-
mittee probably isn’t a good idea, nor is it a good idea to routinely limit mem-
bership to three members. A large audit committee can become bureaucratic
and inefficient with respect to decision-making and review functions. On the
other hand, a three-person committee can quickly become overwhelmed
managing an audit and several employee complaints simultaneously.
When determining the optimum number of audit committee members (which
may depend on who’s up to the task), ask the following questions:
 Is it more practical for a small committee to keep all board members
informed of its activities or for all board members to be directly involved?
 Does the board believe that a larger committee will give shareholders a
greater sense of accountability?
 How much responsibility are committee members willing to assume?
 To what extent are board members willing and able to devote the time
necessary to serve on the committee, and will this commitment cause
them to be diverted from other essential board functions?
 Will the logistics of coordinating a large committee make it inherently
bureaucratic?
Set Up Subcommittees
SOX and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations permit an audit
committee to delegate responsibility for matters under its direction to spe-
cific committee members. These subcommittees report back to the committee
as a whole.
Subcommittees can be used effectively with regards to:
 Handling specific complaints: The audit committee can assign a sub-
committee member to investigate specific complaints it receives or
issues that are brought to its attention; in most cases, the subcommittee
member then makes informed recommendations to the entire commit-
tee. The committee can take advantage of particular members’ areas of
expertise in assigning matters for investigation.
 Addressing specific reporting issues: Issues may arise during the
course of an audit that warrant additional research and analysis as to
their treatment. These tasks can be delegated to a subcommittee for fur-
ther recommendations.
 Hiring and communicating with consultants: SOX provides that audit
committees must be permitted to hire consultants to assist in perform-
ing committee functions. A subcommittee can be assigned to select con-
sultants and obtain and evaluate their recommendations.
260
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Communication and report drafting: Subcommittees can be used to
prepare initial drafts of reports and communications for approval by the
audit committee as a whole.
 Dealing with certain segments of company operations: Some commit-
tee members may be more familiar with particular operations or sectors
of the company’s operations and therefore can effectively make recom-
mendations to the committee on related matters.
Find Your Financial Expert
SOX provides that at least one member of the audit committee must be a
financial expert. According to SEC regulations, a financial expert has exper-
tise in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), audit procedures,
and internal control.
Unfortunately, not every board of directors includes a former auditor, banker,
or other financial expert who’s willing to serve on the company’s audit com-
mittee. However, because the NYSE and other major stock exchanges require
an audit committee with a financial expert, you must find the requisite finan-
cial expertise to meet listing standards.
Your company can pursue several options when it finds itself without a finan-
cial expert. One option is to recruit another director for your board, one who
qualifies as a financial expert. This approach, however, has at least one major
drawback: The company may feel compelled to compromise on its usual cri-
teria and standards for selecting directors because it’s under pressure to
locate a specific type of person to serve a specific purpose.
Another solution is to hire an outside consultant to advise the audit commit-
tee (SOX authorizes the audit committee to hire experts to assist in carrying
out its functions). Hiring a financial expert rather than electing one to the
board of directors is a strategy that offers the following advantages:
 An outside expert can be chosen solely on the basis of his or her exper-
tise without regard to any other consideration.
 The board of directors may be more willing to defer to the judgment of
an outside expert than to the audit committee (which, as you recall, is
made up of board members).
 Most state and federal laws and corporate bylaws permit directors to
rely in good faith on advice given by an outside expert.
 Differentiating the roles and responsibilities of audit committee mem-
bers based on the fact that one or more members are financial experts is
unnecessary.
261
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for an Effective Audit Committee

When selecting an expert, inquire as to whether his or her professional liability
insurance covers advising your committee. As a safeguard, your company
should be able to recover from the expert’s malpractice insurance carrier in
the event that the expert provides incorrect advice that damages the company.
Create Questionnaires
SOX strives to ensure that both external audit firms and internal committee
members have conflict-free consciences in every respect. To that end, auditors
must be rotated after five years with a particular company and be stacked two
per audit. In addition, committee members and their immediate families must
relinquish any financial ties to the company and its affiliates (other than receiv-
ing their directors’ fees and ordinary dividends on stock). (For more informa-
tion about the requirements that now apply to audit firms, see Chapter 5.)
Unexpected conflicts, however, creep into many scenarios For example, a
director may not realize that his adult child has taken a position with an affili-
ate; or an auditor may change jobs, and the new audit firm may not realize
that she audited the new company two years ago while in the employ of the
prior company.
To avoid unpleasant surprises, audit committees should compile routine ques-
tionnaires designed to elicit all relevant information regarding potential con-
flicts of interest from potential committee members, consultants, and experts.
Adopt a Smart Charter
No company can trade on the NYSE or NASDAQ without a written audit com-
mittee charter. The exchanges each specify in their listing requirements what
the charter must contain, but generally, contents include the committee’s
purpose, role within the company, and policies.
For more on audit committee charters, check out Chapter 7. Also, you can find a
sample charter that meets the requirements of both exchanges in Appendix C.
Keep Track of Complaints
Congress and the SEC are serious about creating a safe environment for
employees, accounting staff, and auditors to come forward with information
that can impact audited financial statements. In this type of regulatory envi-
ronment, no company can afford for its audit committee to treat any com-
plaint as frivolous.
262
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

SOX requires an audit committee to have procedures in place for receiving
and handling complaints about the company’s “accounting, internal account-
ing controls or auditing matters, including procedures for submission of
anonymous complaints by employees.”
Your company should keep careful records of how complaints are handled.
The audit committee should make sure that these records are complete, rea-
sonably detailed, and consistent. Your committee should make sure that the
records reflect that every complaint was handled without any bias or predis-
position as to its merits.
Communicate Liberally
A recurring theme of the congressional hearings preceding SOX was the need
for more communication among audit committees, internal and external audi-
tors, employees, management, and directors.
The audit committee, in the spirit of the law, should always communicate
issues that need to be aired rather than sweep such issues under the rug. In
particular, the committee should demonstrate a consistent pattern of com-
munication with management with respect to the following:
 The annual audited financial statements and quarterly reports filed by
the company
 Press releases and financial information provided to the public
 Policies for risk management within the company
 Problems that occur during an audit and management’s response
 The role and performance of the company’s internal auditors
 Changes in company accounting polices
 Issues regarding internal controls and audit adjustments
 Committee policies and procedures
Report Annually
Corporations are required to hold annual meetings, but because shareholders
may be located anywhere in the world, not everyone can attend the meetings
and exercise their votes directly. Some of the shareholders may do so by proxy.
(The process of voting by proxy is described in more detail in Chapter 3.)
263
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for an Effective Audit Committee

The audit committee is required to make a report in the annual company’s
annual proxy statement, which is sent to shareholders just prior to an annual
meeting. The timing is critical because the annual meeting is when members
of the board of directors are elected. An unfavorable audit committee report
can make it harder for directors to hold onto their seats, and because of the
timing, directors may have little time to respond to the committee report
before they’re voted out.
Identify Conflicts . . . and Nonconflicts
Good audit committee members may be hard to come by, so you may not
want to disqualify them unnecessarily. Some situations that seem to involve 
a conflict of interest for a committee member actually may not be a problem,
so it’s important to be able to draw the line between conflict and nonconflict.
For example, it’s not a conflict for an audit committee member to also serve
on the audit committee of an affiliated company. Both companies benefit
from the financial expertise of a single member, and both committees benefit
from the added experience the member gains by serving in both positions.
SOX expressly prohibits an executive officer, general partner, manager, or
employee who holds any sort of policymaking position in the company or
any affiliated company from serving on the audit committee.
Give Notice When Needed
What if an audit committee member ceases to be independent because of a
merger or acquisition? What if the sole financial expert on the committee
resigns for health reasons? If your company acts promptly and provides the
required notice to the exchanges on which its stock is listed, the shortcom-
ings may not be fatal.
Under SOX, stock exchanges must establish procedures for companies to
remedy conditions that result in an audit committee’s noncompliance. For
example, the NYSE and NASDAQ generally allow a committee member who
ceases to be independent for reasons outside his or her reasonable control 
to continue serving until either the next shareholders’ meeting or one year
passes from the event that caused the member to lose independence. In a
case such as this, the company must give prompt notice of the change to the
applicable stock exchange.

Ten Smart Management Moves
In This Chapter
 Forming a disclosure committee
 Holding meaningful meetings
 Maintaining constructive communication with the audit committee
 Seeking out subcertifications
 Being diligent about compliance deadlines
A
good manager is hard to find, which is why the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
(SOX) contains several provisions for top executives who fail to imple-
ment mandated internal controls. Chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief
financial officers (CFOs) are expected to keep their companies profitable
against an unprecedented backdrop of jittery boards, stringent certification
requirements, and threats of personal liability for decisions made in the cor-
porate context.
This section contains a few sensible practices that can serve as defensive tac-
tics for management caught in the tightly regulated and politically charged
post-SOX environment.
Form a Disclosure Committee
Although it’s not required, the SEC recommends that every company form a
disclosure committee to assist senior management by communicating and
reporting material events. Disclosure committees also can be given responsi-
bility for evaluating the significance (materiality) of information and deciding
how and when to disclose it to the public.
Candidates for your company’s disclosure committee may include:
 Senior management
 Middle management responsible for financial control processes, risk
management, information technology, or human resources

 Controller
 General counsel
 Investor relations officer
The committee should review the company’s existing practices and make rec-
ommendations for providing control in areas of perceived weaknesses.
Set Reporting Schedules
CEOs and CFOs who establish disclosure committees (see the preceding sec-
tion) likely will want to work with the committees to schedule and manage
the preparation of annual and quarterly reports. SOX’s increased reporting,
assessment, and certification requirements mean that CEOs must allocate
more lead time than ever before for reviewing and communicating report
contents.
The disclosure committee can determine a schedule that takes into account:
 The time needed to collect information about the company’s disclosure
controls and processes
 The time needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s disclo-
sure controls and procedures
 The time needed for independent auditors to sign off on management’s
assessment under Section 404 (as discussed in more detail in
Chapter 12)
Have More Meetings
One face-to-face meeting may be worth a million memos in the world of cor-
porate compliance. CEOs and CFOs should be sure to schedule regular dis-
cussions with the following groups and individuals:
 Disclosure committee: At least 90 days prior to the filing of the annual
report, the CEO and CFO should meet with the disclosure committee to
confirm that company procedures were carefully followed in generating
report data and to discuss the results of the committee’s evaluation of
the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures.
266
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Department heads and senior managers: The CEO and CFO should
meet with senior management in accounting, technology, financial
reporting, and other relevant areas to discuss:
• Any problems or issues that have arisen with the company’s inter-
nal financial controls
• Any changes that have been made to the internal controls
 Independent auditor: The CEO and CFO should meet with the lead audit
partner of the company’s independent audit firm to discuss:
• Changes in the accountant-recommended financial statements
• Any alternative treatments that the company should consider in
preparing its financial statements
Challenge Dated and Overly
Detailed Policies
Management shouldn’t be shy about bringing ambiguous, overly detailed, or
dated financial reporting policies to the attention of the board of directors
or the audit committee. Management at all levels should be proactive in pro-
moting policies and internal control procedures that are clearly worded and
practical to follow.
Overly detailed policies can be particularly perilous for CEOs and CFOs
who are required to personally certify that company financial statements
are accurate or provide assessments of internal control (as discussed in
Chapter 9). When procedures are outdated or are too detailed, there’s an
increased risk that the policy can’t be followed, and deviations from policies
may be red flags to auditors that internal control issues exist.
Review Reports with Their Preparers
Before signing off on and certifying the company’s report, the CEO and CFO
should thoroughly review specific sections, including the financial state-
ments, with the employees who prepared the section. It’s critical that the
CEO and CFO understand how people within the company are making deci-
sions about financial reporting and how these choices impact the report.
267
Chapter 20: Ten Smart Management Moves

Management should directly communicate with employees who generate key
reports to ferret out errors and incorrect assumptions that impact financial
reporting.
Keep Up with Current Certification
Requirements
SOX Sections 302 and 906 (see Chapter 9) require CEOs and CFOs to person-
ally certify that periodic reports filed with the SEC are accurate. Section 302
imposes civil liability for false certifications, and Section 906 imposes crimi-
nal liability under SOX. The fact that two separate certifications are required
for essentially the same conduct has caused some confusion among public
companies. The form of the certifications is slightly different, as is the liabil-
ity to which CEOs and CFOs are subject under them.
Section 302 certifications by the CEO and CFO are required for quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. SOX also requires a
separate certification under the Section 906 criminal provisions.
On June 5, 2003, the SEC released its final rules interpreting the Section 302
and 906 requirements. The following are a few key points to keep in mind
when filing Section 302 and 906 certifications:
 All certifications should be included as exhibits. The final rules issued
by the SEC require companies to include the Section 302 and Section 906
certifications as exhibits to the reports, which means that they’re docu-
ments submitted at the end of each report. (Prior to these rules compa-
nies simply added special language to the signature pages of their SEC
reports.)
 Certifications may not yet need to include internal control statements.
The SEC has delayed implementation of the internal control rules under
Section 404 for nonaccelerated filers until July 15, 2007. In the meantime,
if Section 404 doesn’t yet apply to a company, its certifying officers may
modify the Section 302 certification to eliminate references to internal
control over financial reporting.
 The language of the certifications is different. Although Section 302
imposing civil penalties and Section 906 imposing criminal penalties
under SOX are directed at the same objective, the language required for
each type of certification is different. Appendix B contains a sample
Section 302 certification and a sample Section 906 certification.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Avoid Animosity with the
Audit Committee
Management should never fall into an adversarial relationship with the audit
committee and should generally err on the side of over-communicating
events to the committee.
It’s important for the CEO and CFO to discuss and fully understand any defi-
ciencies detected in the company’s internal controls identified by indepen-
dent auditors and to work with the audit committee in developing a plan of
action to correct them.
In the event that management has a disagreement with the audit committee,
it can ask the committee to hire an independent consultant (such as an attor-
ney) to advise the audit committee on how to resolve the issue. If the issue
remains unresolved, the CEO and CFO may consider bringing the issue before
the company’s board of directors.
Don’t Confuse Certification with Control
CEOs and CFOs aren’t required to certify every form filed with the SEC under
SOX Sections 302 and 906 (for the skinny on certifications, flip to Chapter 9).
However, every form must be prepared using control procedures and stan-
dards that ensure the accuracy of the reporting.
Reports that only cover current events, such as reports on Form 8-K, need
not be accompanied by Section 302 and 906 certifications.
Consider Getting Subcertifications
It’s becoming a trend in corporate America for CEOs and CFOs to ask senior
management to provide them with certifications on matters that they (the
CEOs and CFOs) must certify. Requiring principal persons within the organi-
zation to certify their work can set an important tone for compliance within
the organization. However, subcertifications don’t have the actual legal effect
of shifting any legal liability from the CEO or CFO. Chapter 9 discusses sub-
certifications more fully, and you can see a sample subcertification in
Appendix B.
269
Chapter 20: Ten Smart Management Moves

Track All the Timelines
SOX accelerates a number of SEC filing deadlines for standard types of forms.
For example, the timelines for filing quarterly report Form 10-Q and annual
report Form 10-K are shortened to 35 days and 60 days, respectively, after
the end of the related fiscal period. (For more on these forms, check out
Chapter 3.) In addition, SOX has increased substantially the number of
events that require current reporting on Form 8-K within four days or less.
(The SEC filing requirements are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.)

Chapter 21
Ten Things You Can’t Ask an
Auditor to Do After SOX
In This Chapter
 Banning auditors from bookkeeping
 Considering whether auditors can still be consultants
 Avoiding appraisals and other services by auditors
 Keeping auditors from serving as lawyers, experts, or consultants
I
n order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), your company is
required to retain several firms simultaneously to do the work that one
firm previously performed, and that extra manpower may mean higher
accounting costs, both internally and externally. For auditors to maintain the
required independence from audit clients, SOX Section 201 as well as SEC and
PCAOB regulations tell CPAs what services they can no longer offer to clients
to whom they provide audit services.
Prior to passing SOX, Congress concluded that large audit firms and the
companies they audited were becoming way too chummy. Auditors who ren-
dered unfavorable opinions risked losing lucrative consulting deals for other
services they performed for the company. Also, auditors were sometimes
involved in preparing the financial information and statements they would
later audit. Management was free to negotiate with auditors about the adjust-
ments the auditors recommended making to the financial statements.
SOX is intended to ensure that auditors remain objective and firm in their
commitment to the accuracy of the financial statements on which the invest-
ing public relies. This chapter lists ten tasks you can no longer ask a CPA firm
to perform if it’s auditing your company.

Keep Your Books
During the congressional hearings following the Enron debacle, it came to
light that accounting firm Arthur Andersen had received $25 million in audit
fees and $27 million in consulting fees from Enron in the years prior to its
bankruptcy filing. This revelation led Congress to conclude that auditors
shouldn’t be auditing their own work. The CPAs who keep the books for a
company should be different from the ones auditing the company’s books.
SOX Section 201(a) states that it’s unlawful for a CPA firm to provide account-
ing and related services “contemporaneously” with any audit. Specifically,
Section 201 forbids firms from performing “bookkeeping or other financial
services related to the accounting records or the financial statements of the
audit client.”
The SEC rule further broadens the prohibition, going beyond simply banning
services that are contemporaneously provided. SEC regulations ban CPAs
from providing bookkeeping services at any point in time if it’s reasonable to
conclude that such services will become subject to audit by the same CPA
firm at any time in the future. The SEC rule also makes clear that there are no
“emergency” exceptions to these regulations.
Fix Your Financial Information Systems
Prior to SOX, most large accounting firms had management information sys-
tems departments or similarly designated divisions that helped design and
implement software systems for their clients.
According to SOX Section 201, your audit firm can no longer help you design
or implement financial information systems. The auditors ultimately may be
called upon to evaluate the same systems they put into place or helped you
maintain.
The SEC rules further broaden this SOX prohibition: The SEC directs auditors
to steer clear of any system in your company that compiles source data that
may end up on your financial statements in one form or another. In some situ-
ations, your auditors may not even be able to help you out with software sys-
tems unrelated to your financial statements.
Subsequent to SOX, many accounting firms, such as
PricewaterhouseCoopers, have sold off their computer consulting and infor-
mation management divisions.
272
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Appraise Company Property
Appraisal and valuation issues directly impact your financial statements, so
it’s not surprising that auditors are prohibited from getting involved in them
under SOX Section 201. In the course of the audit, your company’s auditors
may be asked to assess the value of assets reported on your balance sheet.
Valuation also involves determinations of fairness and reasonableness of
transactions affecting the appraised assets.
Consistent with SOX, auditors can no longer issue opinions as to the fairness
of like-kind exchanges. Like-kind exchanges are common transactions in which
businesses exchange one type of property for another asset of the same type.
For example, your company may exchange one factory building for another
that meets its current needs. The transaction then qualifies for tax treatment
as an exchange rather than a sale, and the company may defer some tax lia-
bility. But the whole transaction still has to be evaluated from the standpoint
of whether it was conducted in an arms-length manner, which means that the
amounts paid or received should be consistent with similar deals in the mar-
ketplace. The overall transaction must be fair to company shareholders.
The SEC rule also prohibits auditors from rendering an opinion on your com-
pany’s pension liabilities. This service falls within the ambit of appraisal and
valuation.
Act as an Actuary
Actuarial services are the kind of number-crunching services many people
envision accountants performing. SOX Section 201 now prohibits a com-
pany’s auditors from providing them because actuarial services involve a
determination of amounts recorded in the financial statements. Making this
determination can lead to a conflict of interest if the actuarially determined
amounts are questioned later in an audit.
Perform Internal Audit Services
for Your Company
SOX Section 201 provides a special limitation in the situation where a com-
pany hires its auditors to assist its own accounting staff in checking out the
company’s books. This is known as an internal audit, as distinct from the inde-
pendent audit that outside CPA firms are engaged to perform.
273
Chapter 21: Ten Things You Can’t Ask an Auditor to Do After SOX

Under SOX, the firm that audits your company can’t participate in creating or
maintaining your company’s internal accounting controls because the auditor
may ultimately be reviewing and rendering an opinion on the controls.
Internal audits are performed primarily for the purpose of assisting the com-
pany’s management in running the company profitably. In contrast, the out-
side audit firm is usually engaged to render opinions on a company’s financial
statements.
SEC rules don’t prohibit your auditor from performing services related to
your company’s internal audit if those services aren’t related to the internal
accounting controls, financial systems, or financial statements.
Fill In for Your Management Team
Sox Section 201 says that your auditor can’t provide management services to
your company. Doing so would be an inherent conflict of interest under SOX
because auditors are engaged in large part to evaluate management and to
certify management’s reports regarding the company’s internal controls.
SEC Regulation S-X Rule 210.2-01(c)(4)(vi) explains that auditors are prohib-
ited from “acting, temporarily or permanently, as a director, officer, or
employee of an audit client, or performing any decision-making, supervisory,
or ongoing monitoring function for the audit client.”
Be a Headhunter
SOX seeks to keep auditors from forming the chummy relationships with
management that characterized the relationships that Enron, WorldCom, and
other large firms developed prior to SOX. Helping a management candidate
get a job with the company could lead to a scenario in which the grateful
manager recommends a specific audit firm, and, in turn, the audit firm is
ingratiated to management. Such events can compromise the objectivity of
the audit process.
Auditors can’t act as headhunters for your company or recommend a specific
candidate for a job under any circumstances. As SEC Regulation S-X Rule
210.2-01 (c)(4)(vii) spells out, they can’t help your company find “prospective
candidates for managerial, executive, or director positions.”
274
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Auditors also can’t help your company evaluate prospective management
candidates by
 Performing psychological testing.
 Conducting reference checks.
 Negotiating employment or compensation contracts.
Advise You on Investments
Some provisions of SOX simply reiterate what previously has been the law.
Such is the case with Section 201’s prohibition of auditors from providing
“broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services.” Were
such a prohibition not in place, auditors would likely tend to uncritically rely
on investment performance data they had prepared themselves.
Auditors also can’t act as promoters or underwriters on behalf of the clients
they audit.
Dispense Legal Advice
Attorneys have always carefully guarded their professional turf against
accountants and other potentially competing professional service providers,
which explains why most states have specific legal prohibitions on practicing
law without a law license.
SOX prohibits auditors from providing services to audit clients. However,
most CPA firms already are well aware of the restrictions imposed by state
statutes prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law and don’t have a sense
that this particular SOX provision further restricts their activities.
The provision of tax services has always been an area of overlap and contro-
versy between lawyers and accountants. Accountants render tax advice even
though it’s impossible to do so without interpreting the applicable tax laws
and advising clients on the way the tax laws should be applied.
275
Chapter 21: Ten Things You Can’t Ask an Auditor to Do After SOX

Give You an Expert Opinion
Auditors can’t give their clients expert opinions on specific issues that must
be addressed during the course of an audit. For example, your auditor can’t
write you a memo giving his or her opinion about a regulatory issue, a law-
suit, or an administrative proceeding in which your company may be
involved.
The reasoning for this rule is that your auditor may become a witness in such
a proceeding or may be subpoenaed to give information in a related investi-
gation in which your company may become embroiled. In a legal proceeding,
auditors may be called as witnesses to explain an accounting position your
company has taken based on an expert opinion. In that event, you’re likely to
be thankful for their unimpaired and credible testimony.
Because SOX doesn’t define expert services, the accounting profession has no
real way of knowing how broadly the PCAOB or SEC will define them. CPAs
also worry that SOX’s limitations in this area could inspire parallel state legis-
lation or rule changes that directly affect both nonpublic companies and
CPAs who provide services to them.

Top Ten Places to Get Smart
About SOX
In This Chapter
 Finding the most prestigious SOX publications
 Frequenting the funniest SOX sites
 Keeping up with current SOX events and regulatory actions
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was Congress’s attempt to head off a public
revolt at the polls after the wave of corporate scandals that kicked off
with Enron and peaked with WorldCom (as I recount in Chapter 2). The legis-
lature and the Justice Department directed their wrath at the accounting pro-
fession and corporate management, resulting in the criminal conviction of
the nation’s largest accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, LLP, and decades-long
prison sentences for some of the most powerful figures in corporate America
(and even one executive’s wife).
Now, the media frenzy seems to be subsiding, and even the Justice
Department has lost its momentum, as symbolized by the acquittal of Richard
Scrushy, the CEO of the embattled HealthSouth Corporation, in the first crimi-
nal trial after SOX’s passage. (Check out Chapter 16 for the Scrushy story.)
In the aftermath of the major scandals and trials, the SEC is still issuing regu-
lations, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) is still
spewing standards, and courts continue to make case law. Numerous publica-
tions and books (like this one) have been spawned, and Web sites hawk every
conceivable SOX service and product from software systems to t-shirts.
In an era of information overload, this chapter directs you to the ten best
online and print resources for staying in synch with SOX developments.

Spring for a Subscription
to Compliance Week
If you’re pulling down a six-figure salary in a job that depends on you being
smart about SOX, you should invest in a subscription to Compliance Week. It’s
the kind of publication that gives you status just by having a copy on your desk
(unlike this book).
For a few thousand dollars a year, your company gets:
 A weekly newsletter authored by SOX-perts such as former SEC chairman
Harvey Pitt
 Access to a companion Web site that contains sample documents, data-
bases, and resources
 A glossy print magazine with pictures of all your favorite SOX stars and
articles on topics such as reducing compliance costs, cutting-edge gov-
ernance strategies, perspectives on new rulings, and gossip about
turnover and policy changes at the PCAOB and SEC
The publishers of Compliance Week boast that the magazine and Web site
have over 4,000 corporate subscribers and are “widely recognized as a criti-
cal tool for senior corporate executives to carry out their duties in this heav-
ily regulated business environment.”
The single-user price for Compliance Week is $999. Firm-wide subscriptions
for an unlimited number of users at one company cost $2,999. (It may seem
pricey, but it’s much cheaper than defending an indictment or weathering an
SEC investigation.)
To get a 30-day trial subscription and for more information, visit www.
complianceweek.com.
Sample SOX-online
SOX-online (www.sox-online.com) is definitely the hippest SOX site on the
Web. It dubs itself “the vendor-neutral site,” and as far as I can tell, it really is.
SOX-online doesn’t seem to be selling anything other than advertising. The
site is updated daily and links to hundreds of articles on compliance topics
and SOX developments. It also has really cool links, including the following:

to recommend to the SEC that it exempt public companies having less than

Section 404 audit. The recommendation requires full committee and SEC
approval to become effective, so the outcome is anyone’s guess.

Sample Certifications
S
OX Sections 302 and 906 require chief executive officers and financial
officers to certify as to the accuracy of the company’s financial state-
ments in filings and periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). A misleading or inaccurate Section 302 certification may
result in civil penalties, and criminal penalties may follow for failure to exe-
cute an accurate Section 906 certification (discussed in Chapter 9). The sub-
stance of both certifications is somewhat redundant, and experts have
questioned whether the requirement of separate certifications was an error.
Although SOX does not require chief information officers and other manage-
ment to sign Section 302 and 906 certifications, it is the practice of many
companies to require them to sign employee subcertifications. A sample form
for an employee subcertification is included at the end of this appendix.

statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered
by this report;
3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the regis-

(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regard-
ing the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles;
(c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls
and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures,
as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
evaluation; and
(d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal con-
trol over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s
most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in

T
he following Example Audit Committee Charter, reproduced with permis-
sion from the APPFA, captures many of the best practices used at the
time of its writing, July of 2003. Of course, no example charter encompasses
all activities that might be appropriate to a particular audit committee, nor
will all activities identified in an example charter be relevant to every com-
mittee. Accordingly, this example charter may be tailored to each commit-
tee’s needs and governing rules. Moreover, as applicable laws, rules, and

nicate any matters of importance to stockholders. The following is a simpli-
fied example of an audit committee report that may form a starting point for
the specific disclosures required within your company.

Appendix E
Sample Corporate Governance
Principles
E
very company is a unique animal with its own products or services, man-
agement structures, and board personas. However, all companies in this
era of post-SOX scrutiny must adopt principles and practices that fulfill its
commitment to creating a top-down control environment and atmosphere of
accountability. The following is sample set of governance principals adopted
by the company that publishes this book, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
Corporate Governance Principles
To promote the best corporate governance practices, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
adheres to the Corporate Governance Principles (“Principles”), many of
which have been in effect for more than a decade. The Board of Directors
(the “Board”) and management believe that these Principles, which are con-
sistent with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the New York Stock Exchange, are in the best interests of the Company,
its shareholders and other stakeholders, including employees, authors, cus-
tomers and suppliers. The Board is responsible for ensuring that the
Company has a management team capable of representing these interests
and of achieving superior business performance.
I. Primary Duties 
The Board, which is elected annually by the shareholders, exercises over-
sight and has final authority and responsibility with respect to the Company’s
affairs, except with respect to those matters reserved to shareholders. All
major decisions are considered by the Board as a whole. 

The Board elects the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and other corporate
officers, acts as an advisor to and resource for management, and monitors
management’s performance. The Board plans for the succession of the CEO.
The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the CEO’s performance,
approves the CEO’s compensation, and informs the Board of its decision. The
Board also oversees the succession process for certain other management
positions, and the CEO reviews with the Board annually his assessment of
key management incumbents and their professional growth and development
plans. The Board also: 
a. reviews the Company’s business and strategic plans and actual operat-
ing performance;
b. reviews and approves the Company’s financial objectives, investment
plans and programs; and
c. provides oversight of internal and external audit processes and financial
reporting.
II. Director Independence 
The Board has long held that it is in the best interests of the Company for
the Board to consist of a substantial majority of independent Directors. The
Board determines that a Director is independent if he or she has no material
relationship, either directly or indirectly, with the Company, defined as
follows: 
a. is not and has not been within the three years immediately prior to the
annual meeting at which the nominees of the Board will be voted upon
employed by the Company or its subsidiaries in an executive capacity;
b. is not an executive officer, an employee, and does not have an immedi-
ate family member who is an executive officer or employee, of an organi-
zation that makes payments to, or receives payments from, the
Company in an amount which, in any single fiscal year, exceeds 2% of
such other organization’s consolidated gross revenues;
c. is not a significant advisor or consultant to the Company (including its
subsidiaries), does not have direct, sole responsibility for business
between the Company and a material supplier or customer, and does not
have a significant personal services contract with the Company;
d. The Director is not, and has not been within the past three years,
employed by or affiliated with a firm that provided independent audit
services to the Company; the Director is not, and does not have an
immediate family member who is a current partner of a firm that is the
336
Part VII: Appendixes 

Company’s external auditor; and the Director or an immediate family
member was not within the past three years a partner or employee of
the Company’s external audit firm and personally worked on the
Company’s audit within that time.
e. The director does not have an immediate family member who is a cur-
rent employee of the Company’s external audit firm and who partici-
pates in that firm’s audit, assurance or tax compliance practice.
f. is not, and has not been in the past three years, part of an interlocking
directorship involving compensation committees;
g. is not a member of the immediate family of Peter Booth Wiley, Bradford
Wiley II and Deborah E. Wiley, or management, as listed in the
Company’s proxy statement.
When determining the independence of a Director, the ownership of, or bene-
ficial interest in, a significant amount of stock, by itself, is not considered a
factor. 
III. Composition of the Board 
Under the Company’s By-Laws, the Board has the authority to determine the
appropriate number of directors to be elected so as to enable it to function
effectively and efficiently. Currently, a ten-member Board is considered to be
appropriate, though size may vary. The Governance Committee makes recom-
mendations to the Board concerning the appropriate size of the Board, as
well as selection criteria for candidates. Each candidate is selected based on
background, experience, expertise, and other relevant criteria, including
other public and private company boards on which the candidate serves. In
addition to the individual candidate’s background, experience and expertise,
the manner in which each board member’s qualities complement those of
others and contributes to the functioning of the Board as a whole are also
taken into account. The Governance Committee nominates a candidate, and
the Board votes on his or her candidacy. The shareholders vote annually for
the entire slate of Directors. 
Any nominee Director who receives a greater number of “withheld” votes
from his or her election than “for” votes shall tender his or her resignation
for consideration by the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee
shall recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to such
resignation. 
337
Appendix E: Sample Corporate Governance Principles

IV. Director Eligibility 
Directors shall limit the number of other board memberships (excluding non-
profits) in order to insure adequate attention to Wiley business. Directors
shall advise the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Governance
Committee in advance of accepting an invitation to serve on a new board.
Whenever there is a substantial change in the Director’s principal occupa-
tion, a Director shall tender his or her resignation and shall immediately
inform the Board of any potential conflict of interest. The Governance
Committee will recommend to the Board the action, if any, to be taken with
respect to the resignation or the potential conflict of interest. 
The Board has established a retirement age of 70 for its Directors. The Board
may in its discretion nominate for election a person who has attained age 70
if it believes that under the circumstances it is in the Company’s best interests. 
V. Board and Management Communication 
The Board has access to all members of management and external advisors.
As appropriate, the Board may retain independent advisors. 
The CEO shall establish and maintain effective communications with the
Company’s stakeholder groups. The Board schedules regular executive ses-
sions at the end of each meeting. Non-management directors meet at regu-
larly scheduled sessions without management. The Chairman of the Board
presides at these sessions. In addition, the independent directors meet at
least once each year in an executive session presided over by the Chairman
of the Governance Committee. 
Employees and other interested parties may contact the non-management
directors via email at: non-managementdirectors@wiley.com, or by mail
addressed to Non-Management Directors, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Mail Stop
7-02, 111 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030-5774. 
VI. Board Orientation and Evaluation 
The Board annually conducts a self-evaluation to determine whether the
Board as a whole and its individual members, including the Chairman, are
performing effectively. 
338
Part VII: Appendixes 

The Board sponsors an orientation process for new Directors, which includes
background materials on governance, law, board principles, financial and
business history and meetings with members of management. The Board also
encourages all of its Directors to take advantage of educational programs to
improve their effectiveness. 
VII. Director Compensation 
The Governance Committee periodically reviews and recommends to the
Board its members’ annual retainer, which is composed of cash and stock
grants for all non-employee Directors. In determining the appropriate amount
and form of director compensation, the Board regularly evaluates current
trends and compensation surveys, as well as the amount of time devoted to
Board and committee meetings. As a long-standing Board principle, non-
employee Directors receive no compensation from the Company other than
for their service as Board members and reimbursement for expenses
incurred in connection with attendance at meetings. 
Share ownership by each Director is encouraged. To this end, each Director
is expected to own, at a date no later than three years after election to the
Board, shares of common stock valued at not less than three times that
Director’s annual cash compensation to which the Director is entitled for
Board service. 
VIII. Board Practices and Procedures 
The Chairman of the Board and the CEO jointly set the agenda for each Board
meeting. Agenda items that fall within the scope and responsibilities of Board
committees are reviewed with the chairs of the committees. Any Board
member may request that an item be added to the agenda. 
Board materials are provided to Board members sufficiently in advance of
meetings to allow Directors to prepare for discussion at the meeting. 
Various managers regularly attend portions of Board and committee meetings
in order to participate in and contribute to relevant discussions. 
339
Appendix E: Sample Corporate Governance Principles

IX. Board Committees 
The Board has established four standing committees: Executive, Audit,
Compensation, and Governance. The Audit Committee and the Compensation
Committee are composed of independent Directors only. The Audit Committee
has the sole responsibility for retention and dismissal of the Company’s inde-
pendent auditors. The Governance Committee is composed of independent
directors and a member of the Wiley family, as permitted under the New York
Stock Exchange’s rules applicable to “controlled companies.” The Board
believes that the family’s participation in the Committee will result in a col-
laborative process to promote the highest standards in the recruitment of
new directors and governance generally. 
The Governance Committee recommends to the Board the members and
chairs for each of the committees. The chair and membership assignments
for all committees are reviewed regularly and rotated as appropriate. The
chairs of the committees determine the frequency, length and agenda of
meetings for each committee meeting. As in the case of the Board, materials
are provided in advance of meetings to allow members to prepare for discus-
sion at the meeting. 
The scope and responsibilities of each committee are detailed in the commit-
tee charters, which are approved by the Board. Each committee annually
reviews its charter, and the Governance Committee and the Board review all
charters from time to time. 
With the permission of the chairman of the committee, any Board member
may attend a meeting of any committee. 
X. Periodic Review 
The Governance Committee and the Board review these Principles annually.

Sample Code of Ethics
O
ne Sarbanes-Oxley innovation is the requirement that companies adopt
a written code of ethics to help management, boards, and rank-and-file
employees from rationalizing themselves over the line when ethical dilemmas
arise and tough choices must be made.  Here is a sample code adopted by
the company that publishes this book, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
Business Conduct and Ethics Policy
Policy
It is the Company’s policy to manage and operate worldwide business activi-
ties in conformity with applicable laws and high ethical standards. Both the
Board of Directors and management are determined to comply fully with the
law, and to maintain the Company’s reputation for integrity and fairness in
business dealings with others.
Scope
This policy applies to all employees, officers and directors at all Company
locations.
Responsibility
All employees, officers and directors are expected to adhere to all ethical and
legal standards as outlined in this policy and to preserve the Company’s
integrity and reputation. 

Provisions
1. Financial Record-Keeping
It is the policy of the Company to fully and fairly disclose the financial condi-
tion of the Company in compliance with the applicable accounting principles,
laws, rules and regulations and to make full, fair, accurate, timely and under-
standable disclosure in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in other communications to securities
analysts, rating agencies and investors. Honest and accurate recording and
reporting of information is critical to our ability to make responsible business
decisions. The Company’s accounting records are relied upon to produce
reports for the Company’s management, rating agencies, investors, creditors,
the SEC and other governmental agencies and others. Therefore, our financial
statements and the books and records on which they are based must accu-
rately reflect all corporate transactions and conform to all legal and account-
ing requirements. Our system of internal control is designed to provide this
information. 
All employees have a responsibility to ensure that the Company’s accounting
records do not contain any false or intentionally misleading entries.
Information on which our accounting records are based is the responsibility
of all employees. 
We do not permit intentional misclassification of transactions as to accounts,
departments or accounting periods. In particular we require that: 
 all Company accounting records, as well as reports produced from those
records, are kept and presented in accordance with the laws of each
applicable jurisdiction;
 all records fairly and accurately reflect the transactions or occurrences
to which they relate;
 all records fairly and accurately reflect in reasonable detail the
Company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses;
 the Company’s accounting records do not contain any intentionally false
or misleading entries;
 no transactions are misclassified as to accounts, departments or
accounting periods;
 all transactions are supported by accurate documentation in reasonable
detail and recorded in the proper account and in the proper accounting
period;
 all Company accounting financial reports be prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles; and
 the Company’s system of internal accounting controls, including com-
pensation controls, to be followed at all times.
342
Part VII: Appendixes 

2. Improper Payments
No payment or transfer of Company funds or assets shall be made that is not
authorized, properly accounted for and clearly identified on the Company’s
books. Payment or transfer of the Company’s funds and assets are to be used
only as specified in the supporting documents. 
No employee, officer or director may authorize any payment or use any funds
or assets for a bribe, “kickback,” or similar payment that is directly or indi-
rectly for the benefit of any individual (including any government official,
agent or employee anywhere in the world), company or organization in the
United States or any foreign country, and which is designed to secure favor-
able treatment for the Company. Under federal legislation it is a felony to
make payments of this kind to foreign government officials. 
3. Political Contributions
It is the Company’s policy not to contribute any Company funds or assets to
any political party, committee, organization, or candidate for any office (fed-
eral, state or local) in the United States or any foreign country. Employees
may, on their own time, support individual candidates or political commit-
tees, all subject to applicable laws, and may make voluntary contributions to
such candidates or committees, including any Company-related political
action committee. 
4. Acceptance of Payments
Employees, officers and directors may not seek or accept either directly or
indirectly, any payments, fees, services, or other gratuities (irrespective of
size or amount) outside the normal course of the employee’s business duties
from any other person, company or organization that does or seeks to do
business with the Company. Gifts of cash or cash equivalents of any amount
are strictly prohibited. The receipt of common courtesies, sales promotion
items of nominal value, occasional meals, and reasonable entertainment
appropriate to a business relationship and associated with business discus-
sions are permissible. 
5. Business Entertainment
All solicitations or dealings with suppliers, customers, or others doing or
seeking to do business with the Company shall be conducted solely on a
basis that reflects both the Company’s best business interests and its high
ethical standards. The Company does permit the providing of common cour-
tesies, entertainment, and occasional meals for potential or actual suppliers,
customers, or others involved with the Company’s business, in a manner
appropriate to the Company’s relationship and associated with business dis-
cussions. Expenses in this connection must be reasonable, customary and
properly authorized. 
343
Appendix F: Sample Code of Ethics

6. Conflicts of Interest
The Company expects all employees, officers and directors to exercise good
judgment and the highest ethical standards in private activities outside the
Company that in any way can affect the Company. They shall at all times
exercise particular care that no detriment to the interest of the Company may
result from a conflict between those interests and any personal or business
interests which the individual may have. In particular, every employee, offi-
cer and director has an obligation to avoid any activity, agreement, business
investment or interest or other situation that might, in fact or in appearance,
cause an individual to place his or her own interest, or that of any other
person or entity, above his or her obligation to the Company. The words “in
appearance” should be noted particularly since the appearance of an action
might tend to impair confidence even if the individual may not actually do
anything wrong.
To this end, employees, officers and directors must avoid any investments,
associations or other relationships that could conflict with the staff
member’s responsibility to make objective decisions in the Company’s best
interests. Any potential conflicts of interest must be reported immediately to
the senior officer of the staff member’s division or subsidiary, and the
Company’s General Counsel. In the case of an officer, conflicts of interest
must be reported immediately to a senior officer or the Company’s CEO as
applicable, and its General Counsel. In the case of a director, conflicts should
be reported to the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, and the Company’s
General Counsel.
7. Corporate Opportunities
No employee, officer or director of the Company shall for personal or any
other person’s or entity’s gain deprive the Company of any business opportu-
nity or benefit which could be construed as related to any existing or reason-
ably anticipated future activity of the Company. Employees, officers and
directors who learn of any such opportunity through their association with
the Company may not disclose it to a third party or invest in the opportunity
without first offering it to the Company.
8. Confidentiality
All employees, officers and directors are responsible for safeguarding and
keeping confidential any information that the Company considers to be of a
confidential or sensitive nature. Such information includes, but is not limited
to financial records and reports, marketing and strategic planning informa-
tion, employee-related documents, unpublished manuscripts as well as infor-
mation relating to potential mergers and acquisitions, stock splits and
divestitures, and other materials that the Company would not want disclosed
to a competitor or any unauthorized recipient, or that might be harmful to
the Company or its customers if disclosed whether or not such information is
344
Part VII: Appendixes 

marked “confidential.” Confidential information also includes information
concerning possible transactions with other companies or information about
the Company’s customers, suppliers or joint venture partners, which the
Company is under an obligation to maintain as confidential. Employees, offi-
cers and directors may not use Confidential Information for their own per-
sonal benefit or the benefit of persons or entities outside the Company, and
must exercise caution and discretion with respect to any appropriate tempo-
rary removal of confidential or sensitive information from the Company’s
premises, and should safeguard the information from unintended disclosure
or loss. Employees must at all times adhere to the Company’s policies regard-
ing the transmission and storage of the Company’s confidential and sensitive
business records.
9. Compliance With Laws and Regulations
The Company requires its employees, officers and directors to comply with
all applicable laws and regulations in countries where the Company does
business. Violation of domestic or foreign laws and regulations may subject
an individual, as well as the Company, to civil and/or criminal penalties.
Employees have an obligation to comply with all laws and regulations and
policies and procedures and to promptly alert management of any deviation
from them.
(a) Antitrust Laws
It is the Company’s policy to comply with the letter and spirit of all applica-
ble antitrust laws. If the legality of any contemplated transaction, agreement
or arrangement is in doubt, employees, officers and directors must consult
with a Company staff attorney.
Discussions with competitors regarding the Company’s prices, credit terms,
terms and conditions of sale, strategies or other confidential, sensitive or
proprietary information are not permissible. This applies both to individual
discussions and to participation in trade and professional associations and
other business organizations. If a competitor initiates such a discussion, the
staff member should refuse to participate or request that counsel be con-
tacted. Staff members should seek guidance from a Company staff attorney
when appropriate.
(b) Insider Trading
No employee, officer or director may trade in securities while in possession
of material inside information or disclose material inside information to third
parties (“tipping”). Material inside information is any information that has
not reached the general marketplace through a press release, earnings
release or otherwise, and is likely to be considered important by investors
deciding whether to trade (e.g., earnings estimates, significant business
investments, mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and other developments,
345
Appendix F: Sample Code of Ethics

expansion or curtailment of operations, and other activity of significance).
Using material inside information for trading, or tipping others to trade, is
both unethical and illegal. Accordingly, no employee, officer or director of the
Company may: (a) trade securities of the Company or any other company
while in possession of material inside information with respect to that com-
pany; (b) recommend or suggest that anyone else buy, sell, or hold securities
of any company while the employee is in possession of material inside infor-
mation with respect to that company (this includes formal or informal advice
given to family, household members and friends); and (c) disclose material
inside information to anyone, other than those persons who need to know
such information in order for the Company to properly and effectively carry
out its business (e.g., to lawyers, advisers and other Company employees
working on the matter). Of course, where material inside information is per-
mitted to be disclosed, the recipient should be advised of its non-public
nature and the limitations on its use. Any questions as to whether informa-
tion is material or non-public should be directed to the Company’s General
Counsel.
10. Fair Dealing
Each employee, officer and director should endeavor to deal fairly with the
Company’s suppliers, competitors and employees. No one should take unfair
advantage of another through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair-dealing
practice. Information about the Company’s competitors must be used in an
ethical manner and in compliance with the law. Under no circumstance
should information be obtained through theft, illegal entry, blackmail, or elec-
tronic eavesdropping, or through employees misrepresenting their affiliation
with the Company or their identity. Any proprietary or non-public informa-
tion about the Company’s competitors should not be used if it is suspected
that such information has been obtained improperly.
11. Employment of Relatives
The Company’s policy is to require advance approval before a relative of an
employee is hired by the Company, or is engaged as a consultant or indepen-
dent contractor of the Company, if the relative of the employee will be in the
same department or chain of command of the Wiley employee. Such approval
should be sought from the requisite member of the Wiley Leadership Team
(for US locations) or the Managing Director (international locations) and the
most senior Human Resources officer at the location. A relative of the Wiley
Leadership Team and the Managing Directors of international locations may
only be hired or engaged with the advance review and approval of both the
CEO of the Company and the Senior Vice President--Human Resources. A “rel-
ative” may include a member of the employee’s family (spouse, child, parent,
sibling, in-law) but may also include, for purposes of this Policy, any individ-
ual who is living with or otherwise in a significant relationship with the
employee, or a relative of such an individual.
346
Part VII: Appendixes 

12. Duty to Report Violations
Each employee, officer and director is responsible for promptly reporting to
the Company any circumstances that such person believes in good faith may
constitute a violation of this policy. Except as provided in the next paragraph,
suspected policy violations are to be reported (including confidential and
anonymous reports) to the Company’s General Counsel and its Chief Audit
Executive.
Any complaint regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters must be reported (including confidential and anonymous com-
plaints) to the Company’s General Counsel and its Vice President, Internal
Audit, who will be responsible for reporting as appropriate to the Chairman
of the Company’s Audit Committee Alternatively, complaints may be mailed
directly to the Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee at P.O. Box 1569,
Hoboken, N.J. 07030-5774.
No retribution against any individual who reports violations of this Policy in
good faith will be permitted. However, the reporting of a violation will not
excuse the violation itself. The Company will investigate any matter which is
reported and will take any appropriate corrective action.
13. Violations of Policy
Violations of any of the foregoing provisions may expose the Company and
the individuals involved to lawsuits and possible criminal action. Staff mem-
bers who violate this policy are subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up
to and including termination. Any alleged violations of this Policy will be
reviewed by the Company’s legal department and other appropriate staff
members.
