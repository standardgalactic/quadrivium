Reading Biblical Literature: 
Genesis to Revelation
Scope:
The term Bible means different things to different people, but in all cases, it refers 
to a work that has had a profound influence on the world. Many are familiar with 
the Bible as a sacred text, which is read and studied because of its religious content. 
Others have impressions of the Bible through its cultural influence. Biblical scenes 
have been portrayed in art by Michelangelo and Rembrandt. The Bible’s language 
was set to music by Bach and Handel, and its themes are woven into the novels of 
Dostoevsky and Faulkner. 
The Bible is often regarded as a single book, but it is actually a collection of books, 
composed over more than 10 centuries. The Old Testament or Hebrew Scriptures, 
known to some as the Jewish Bible, tells the stories of ancient Israel, conveys the 
message of the prophets, and includes poetic texts that express joy, despair, and hope. 
The New Testament expands the collection to include narratives of Jesus’s life, along 
with letters by leaders in the ancient church. 
The narratives in the Bible provide an outline for this course. The Old Testament 
begins with narratives that tell of migration and dislocation, slavery and deliverance. 
The plotlines trace the tensions that arise from anticipation and disappointment, 
conflict and reconciliation. There are episodes involving surprise and laughter, and 
others that explore the tragic consequences of arrogance and jealousy. Character 
portrayal is a central feature. Abraham and Sarah, Moses and David prove capable 
of both courage and evasiveness. Tension is heightened as their flaws and failings call 
the future into question. God can display both mercy and outrage. At points, he is 
vividly present, and elsewhere, he seems inscrutable. 
We will consider the Old Testament’s prophetic texts within the broader narrative 
framework. Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other prophets make sharp indictments 
of social injustice and religious infidelity. Yet they also provide visions of hope for 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation

a different future. Other writings include the psalms, which sing of the goodness 
of the natural world, the mystery of God, and life in community. Proverbs offers 
advice on how to get ahead in the world, but Job objects that one can do the right 
things and still suffer. Rather than offering simple answers, the different points of 
view draw readers more deeply into the questions.
The New Testament begins with four narratives of Jesus’s life, each with its own 
perspective. The plotlines advance as Jesus’s words and actions bring conflicting 
responses. Themes of suffering and service, death and life carry the action forward 
toward crucifixion and resurrection. The portrayal of Jesus’s disciples shows them to 
be loyal, flawed, and deeply human. The letters then offer glimpses into the struggles 
and hopes of Jesus’s followers in cities of the Roman Empire. Paul and other writers 
grapple with questions of identity and community in light of their understanding 
of God and the legacy of Jesus. Finally, Revelation or the Apocalypse uses evocative 
images to depict the conflict between God and evil, culminating in new creation. 
Through the interplay of perspectives from the Old and New Testaments, the Bible 
continues to engage readers in reflection about God and themes in human life.

LECTURE 1
The Bible as Dialogue
 A 
s we know, the Bible used by Christians consists of two parts. The first 
part, the Old Testament, is a collection of texts that are shared by both 
Jews and Christians. It includes passages that celebrate the grandeur of 
creation and others that tell of war and conflict, regulations about worship, songs 
of joy and despair, advice on how to get ahead in the world, and denunciations of 
corruption. The second part of the Bible, the New Testament, gives us narratives 
about Jesus and his followers, along with a group of letters, and at the end, the book 
called Revelation or the Apocalypse. In this course, we’ll explore how readers make 
sense of these texts holistically.
Overview of the Bible


The word Bible comes from the Greek word biblía, which means “books.” The 
Bible is a collection of books that were written and edited by different people 
over many centuries. Much of the Old Testament was put in written form 
between the 8th and 2nd centuries B.C., though some of the sources are older 
than that. 
●
●The first part of the Jewish Bible is called the Torah, a Hebrew word that 
means “instruction.” It consists of narratives about ancient Israel, along with 
the laws and customs that gave it its identity. 
●
●Next are the prophetic texts, which relate the message and actions of Israel’s 
prophets. Finally, there are other writings, including narratives, poems, and 
wisdom writings.


The New Testament writings were composed by the followers of Jesus in the 
mid- to late 1st century A.D. The oldest writings were letters sent between 
individuals and congregations. Later, narratives about Jesus and his followers 
were composed. Eventually, some of the narratives and letters were collected 
and used along with the writings of the Old Testament as sacred texts within 
Christian communities. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
4


It’s helpful to think of the Bible as a collection that emerged within community. 
●
●On the one hand, a community needs to have something that binds it together, 
something that creates a sense of shared identity. That bond may be formed by 
shared beliefs and values, along with practices that express those values. These 
bonds are also formed by stories that shape identity and recall the experiences 
that have made the community what it is. 
●
●On the other hand, a community includes multiple points of view. And as it 
continues over time, it faces the challenge of affirming what is shared, while 
holding in tension some points of difference. 
●
●These dynamics also characterize the Bible, which we might describe as a 
community of texts. The writings collected in the Old Testament reflect 
a shared belief in the God of Israel, and those in the New Testament join 
this to belief in Jesus. At the same time, writings in both the Old and New 
Testaments encompass multiple perspectives on what these shared beliefs 
mean and how they are to be lived out. 
The Old Testament 


The Old Testament begins with the stories of ancient Israel. Scholars recognize 
that biblical narratives are based on various ancient sources that have been 
combined and edited over time. In their current form, these books have a sense 
of narrative that can be studied as literature.


When reading a narrative, one basic question concerns plotline. A plotline 
is more than a simple listing of events. It has to do with the way things are 
connected and how one thing leads to the next. A second question concerns 
character portrayal, which can range from simple to complex. 


In a broad sense, the first five books of the Old Testament (Genesis through 
Deuteronomy) tell a story of migration. They trace the migration of Israel’s early 
ancestors from Mesopotamia, near the Euphrates River, to the land of Canaan, 
at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. From there, they move south and 
west into Egypt. Major figures in the story include Abraham and Sarah, Isaac 
and Rebekah, and Jacob and his 12 sons. 

Lecture 1—The Bible as Dialogue 
5


In terms of plotline, the migration from Mesopotamia to Canaan is depicted as 
an act of trust, as Abraham and Sarah follow where God leads them. But the plot 
thickens when they experience famine, conflict, and apparent disappointment. 
Hope continues by only a narrow thread. Abraham is portrayed as courageous at 
some points and indecisive at others. Sarah can be both trusting and skeptical. 
And their varied strengths and failings are an integral part of the story. 


The broader narrative continues as the people flourish in Egypt for many 
generations. But then there’s a political change, and they become enslaved. 
Here, the plot turns to issues of oppression and the need for liberation. The 
dominant figure is Moses, who will lead the people into freedom. Moses is 
sometimes bold and sometimes fearful. His opponent is the Egyptian pharaoh, 
who can be both arrogant and vacillating. 


The moment of liberation is called the Exodus. It’s when the people leave slavery 
in Egypt and begin the migration through the desert toward Canaan again. But 
now the people are portrayed as contentious and unfaithful. Their struggle is 
not against the tyranny of the pharaoh but against the harshness of life in the 
desert and the conflicts that threaten to tear the community apart. 


Throughout these narratives, one of the most intriguing elements is the 
portrayal of God. At times, God speaks clearly and graciously, but at other 
times, he seems inexplicable. Conflict may break out, yet God remains silent. 
God can show compassion for those who suffer and outrage at those who prove 
faithless. The varied aspects of the biblical portrayal of God are challenging, yet 
encountering them draws readers more deeply into the question of who God is. 


The narrative thread continues in the books of Joshua through 2 Kings. These 
tell of Israel’s movement into the land of Canaan, where there is warfare and 
unrest. In time, the people establish a kingdom with its capital at Jerusalem. The 
most notable king is David, who helps forge a national identity. He’s followed by 
Solomon, who builds a temple to be the country’s center of worship. But unity 
is shattered when the kingdom is divided, and military invasions come. The 
northern kingdom is conquered by the Assyrians, and the southern kingdom is 
conquered by the Babylonians. In each case, people are taken into exile. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation

●
●Here, the narrative shows the struggle to make sense of national tragedy. The 
writer wants to affirm that founding the kingdom was congruent with the 
will of God. But that makes it difficult to understand how God could let the 
kingdom be destroyed and the people deported. 
●
●The plotline traces patterns of human disobedience that seem to bring about 
this devastating result, yet it also holds onto more hopeful elements. Other 
Old Testament books continue the story by recounting the return of some of 
the people to Jerusalem, where they rebuild. 


Along with the narratives, the Old Testament includes prophetic writings. A 
common theme in theses texts is the call for a just society. Yet the prophets also 
have distinctive emphases, and they often convey their messages through poetic 
imagery. 


The final collection of material in the Old Testament consists of psalms and 
wisdom writings. The psalms are songs and poems that probe the depths of 
despair and rise to exuberant joy. The wisdom writings ask what it means to live 
a good life. 
The New Testament


The New Testament also begins with narratives. Here, the variety is clear at 
the outset. Each of the four gospels tells the story of Jesus in a distinctive way, 
giving us four portraits of Jesus, not just one. 


Mark’s gospel is the shortest of the four; from the outset, it portrays Jesus 
engaged in conflict. The narrative begins when Jesus is baptized and tested by 
Satan in the desert. After that, Jesus announces God’s kingdom, then he goes to 
a synagogue, where he encounters a man possessed by a demonic spirit. Jesus’s 
first action is performing an exorcism; thus, our initial impression is that he is 
the agent of God confronting the forces of evil. 


Luke’s gospel is rather different. It begins with angels promising a child to an 
elderly couple, then telling a young woman named Mary that she will give 
birth to Jesus. Luke speaks of Jesus being born in a barn, where he is visited

In the New Testament, our 
impressions of Jesus are 
formed by the interplay 
among the four gospels.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
8
by shepherds. Instead of starting with scenes of conflict with evil, Luke tells of 
Jesus being present among ordinary people. 


Matthew takes another approach. His opening lines trace Jesus’s royal genealogy 
back through the generations of Israel. When Matthew tells of Jesus’s birth, he 
says nothing about shepherds. Instead, he refers to wise men, who are foreigners. 
In Matthew’s account, the wise men foreshadow the significance of Jesus for 
foreigners—those outside of Israel’s tradition. 


Finally, John’s gospel sets the story of Jesus in the context of creation. The 
opening lines recall how at the beginning of time, God spoke and brought the 
world into being. For John, that same creative word of God now becomes flesh 
in Jesus. 


The second main part of the New Testament consists of letters written by leaders 
in the early church. Many of the letters are by the Apostle Paul, and they give 
us a sense of the debates within the church: what the Christian faith meant and 
how it was to be lived out. In each case, Paul takes the questions seriously and 
works through them in light of his understanding of God and the significance 
of Jesus.


The last book in the New Testament is called Revelation or the Apocalypse, 
and few books in the Bible have generated more controversy than this one. 
Revelation is written as a series of visions that include a great red dragon and a 
seven-headed beast doing battle with the allies of God. 
●
●Many readers assume that these visions make mysterious predictions about 
the end of the world. But the book’s remarkable imagery seems different 
when you realize that it originally addressed readers living in the Roman 
Empire. The book offers them a way of seeing the world that is both startling 
and encouraging. 
●
●The dramatic plotline leads readers through the struggles of the present 
toward a more hopeful future. It culminates in a vision of New Jerusalem, 
where the river of life is flowing and the gates stand open to receive the 
nations of the world.


As we read through the Bible, we encounter poets and prophets, visionaries 
and social critics. They write in different literary forms and address different 
contexts. For us, that’s not a problem; it’s an invitation. It’s an invitation to 
explore the breadth of material within the Bible and to join in the dialogue 
that’s created as we encounter the various perspectives it contains.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The lecture describes the Bible as a collection of texts that emerged within a 
community. The texts reflect both shared beliefs and different perspectives. 
What were some examples noted in the lecture? Do you find this description 
helpful or unhelpful? Why?
2.	 People begin reading the Bible with different questions in mind. Why are 
you interested in reading the Bible? What positive impressions do you have 
of the Bible? What negative impressions do you have?

LECTURE 2
Creation and Chaos in 
Genesis
 I 
n this lecture, we begin reading the Bible with Genesis, focusing on its first 
11 chapters. As you may recall, Genesis is grouped with the first five books 
of the Bible, which are called the Pentateuch or Torah. These books contain 
material that originated at different times and places but, over the centuries, was put 
in the form we now have. With that in mind, we turn to the book called Genesis, 
which means “origin.” It pictures the creation of the earth, sea, and sky. And with the 
whole earth as the setting, it tells of particular people who travel the ancient world, 
looking for a place to call home. The first part of Genesis deals with beginnings. 
Setting of Genesis


The first words of Genesis are “In the beginning God created the heavens and 
the earth,” and the rest of chapter 1 pictures harmony in the natural world. We 
might think of this opening in terms of film. It begins with a dark screen; we 
see nothing, but we hear the churning waves of the ocean. After a few moments, 
the churning is interrupted by a voice: “Let there be light.” And an inchoate 
light appears. We watch as the light fades into evening and comes back in the 
morning, forming one day. 


A certain rhythm now develops in the “film.” The voice of God speaks again, 
calling for a space to be defined. We can soon see the sea below and the sky 
above. Then, the light fades and comes back to mark a second day. From the sea, 
the dry land appears. It’s rocky and barren at first, but vegetation starts to grow. 
And there is evening and morning—a third day.


On the fourth day, the light is transformed into the sun, moon, and stars. On 
days five and six, we see the sea, sky, and land teeming with life. Along with the 
other creatures on land, we see human beings. They, too, have their place in the 
natural order.

Lecture 2—Creation and Chaos in Genesis 
11


Two distinctive things are said about human beings. First, they are created in 
the image of God, and because of that, their relationship to the world is, in 
some sense, analogous to God’s relationship to the world. That is important, 
because the second thing we are told is that people are given “dominion” over 
the earth, meaning responsibility, not domination or destruction. 
Chapter 1 of Genesis sets up 
a harmony in the natural 
world—a rhythm of light and 
darkness, sea and sky, animals 
and humans.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
12


This creative sequence concludes on the seventh day, when God rests. In biblical 
tradition, people are also to rest on the seventh day. This rest aligns human 
action with God’s action, reflecting the harmony God intends for the world. 
Character Development


A key element in chapter 2 is character development. We discern character by 
what the narrator says about someone and by the way the character interacts 
with others. Genesis 2 tells us that God formed a man from the dust of the 
ground, and here, the writer uses word play to show how people and the earth 
are connected. In Hebrew, the word for “ground” or “earth” is adamah, and the 
word for “human being” or “man” is adam. 


Characterization continues as God places the man in the Garden of Eden. The 
garden is filled with trees bearing fruit, and the way the man is to interact with 
this context is to “work” it and “keep” it. The well-being of the world becomes 
the focus of human work. 


More facets of character emerge when the narrator says that it is not good that 
the man is alone. Thus, God creates all the animals and birds and brings them 
to the man to see what he will call them. By naming the birds and animals, the 
man establishes relationships with them. It’s a step toward overcoming human 
isolation. 


But having relationships with the animals is not enough. God forms a woman 
from one of the man’s ribs. These people are now of the same flesh and bone, 
and they are given names to reflect that relationship. In Hebrew, the man is 
called ish and the woman is ishah. The connection between these words reflects 
the close bond between male and female. The narrator says that both are naked 
and not ashamed; thus, the harmony persists.
Plot Complications


When we turn to chapter 3, we can see a plot developing, centered on the 
disruption of harmony, whose agent is a serpent. This animal plays on the 
human refusal to accept limitation.

Lecture 2—Creation and Chaos in Genesis 
13


As we know, God told the man and woman that they could eat the fruit of every 
tree in the garden, except one: the tree that would give them knowledge of good 
and evil. God warned that by eating from that tree, they would die. And that is 
where disruption will start, at the point where God sets a limit for human beings. 


Why would God would create such a tree, only to tell people not to touch it? 
Instead of answering this question, the story deals with the human desire to 
move beyond the limitation. 


The serpent asks if God really told them not to eat from any tree in the garden. 
The woman dutifully repeats God’s warning—that they will die if they eat from 
the tree of knowledge. The serpent then creates the pivotal moment in the plot 
with some dangerous half-truths. 
●
●He says that if they eat the fruit they won’t die, which is true; they won’t die 
immediately after eating the fruit, although they will die eventually. 
●
●And the serpent says that they’ll become like God, knowing good and evil. 
That’s also true; they will come to know good and evil, although they will 
not be fully like God.


Will the woman’s action be shaped by what God said or what the serpent said? 
Will she respect the limitation or reach beyond it? The narrator heightens the 
tension by noting that the woman can already see that the fruit is “good.” If she 
can already see what is good, then what more could she want—except to learn 
what is evil? 


When the woman and the man eat the fruit, their newfound knowledge brings 
them shame at their nakedness. The positive relationship is disrupted. When God 
asks what happened, the man blames the woman, while she blames the serpent. 


This disruption is reflected in the negative judgment of God. He says that the 
mutuality of women and men will give way to male domination, and humanity’s 
relationship to the earth will be affected. Work will become hard labor, until 
people die and return to the dust from which they were taken.


The story ends when people know the difference between good and evil. Yet God 
recognizes that knowing what is good does not mean doing what is good. He 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
14
assumes they’ll reach beyond the limits again and take from the tree of life, to once 
again seize immortality for themselves. Thus, God sends them out of the garden. 


As literature, the Genesis story is set at the dawn of time, but it’s designed 
to shape perspectives on the world as it is. It shows the contrast between the 
harmony God intends and the disruption human beings have created. On the 
one hand, God intends that people care for the earth and its creatures and that 
women and men be partners in that work. On the other hand, the earth and 
relationships within it have been damaged by human action. 
Noah and the Flood


The narrative thus far has gone from harmony to disruption, but with the story 
of the flood (Gen. 6–9), Noah brings it to a point of renewal. As a favorite in 
children’s literature, the plot of this story is usually simplified into a few major 
elements: God’s warning to Noah, Noah’s need to build an ark and gather the 
animals, the 40 days and nights of rain, and ultimately, the appearance of a 
rainbow—a sign that God will never again send a flood. In its basic outline, it’s 
a wonderful story of deliverance and renewal.


But when we look more closely, the story becomes troubling. It seems 
inexplicable that God brings about this disaster. After all, Genesis introduces 
God as the creator. For God to send the flood means that the creator has become 
the destroyer. In the simplified version, all attention centers on Noah and the 
animals, who ride safely in the ark. But in Genesis itself, we look outside the 
ark, at the people and animals who drown in the deluge. When we ask how the 
creator could do such a thing, there is no easy answer. 


The portrayal of God is surprisingly complex. In Genesis 6:5, the story starts 
with divine grief. God created the world to be good, but he sees that human 
beings have given in to evil. God comes to regret that he ever created humankind 
and decides to blot them out. 


Yet this creates a dilemma for God. Simply blotting out all life would turn the 
creator into the destroyer. This is where Noah plays a role. 

Lecture 2—Creation and Chaos in Genesis 
15
●
●When God commands Noah to save the animals, we see destruction linked 
to renewal, preserving a thread of continuity in the narrative. Earlier, God 
had created life of all sorts and directed human beings to tend to the well-
being of creation. This act is repeated here. 
●
●God directs Noah to tend to the well-being of creation by building an ark, not 
only to save himself but to preserve and renew all the species of life on earth. 
The Tower of Babel


In chapter 11, we find the story of the Tower of Babel, which centers on the use 
and abuse of the power to communicate. As it begins, all people speak the same 
language, but how will they use the power of communication? As we saw earlier, 
God used words to bring forth life and harmony. 


But in the story of Babel, the power to communicate takes a negative turn. 
Here, people use speech to help them build a city with a tower that reaches to 
the heavens. In this context, the story continues the theme of human beings 
trying to reach beyond their appropriate limits. Their intent is arrogant—to 
establish a name for themselves.


God then intervenes by disrupting their power to communicate, bringing the 
project to an end. Here again, the writer plays with language. He refers to 
the project itself as bab-el, meaning “gate of God” in Hebrew. But the writer 
comments that the project actually becomes balal, meaning “confusion.” Thus, 
the attempt to reach the gate of God disintegrates into confusion.


Where has the plotline in Genesis 1–11 taken us? In Eden, people disrupted 
God’s designs; and at Babel, God has disrupted theirs.

LECTURE 3
Abraham, Sarah, and the 
Promise
 A 
braham is a figure of enormous importance for Jews, Christians, and 
Muslims around the world. At the center of his narrative (Gen. 12–25) 
is the question of promise—a commitment concerning the future. When 
a promise is made, it shapes expectations and actions, but it also brings risks. In the 
story of Abraham, the theme of promise is taken to another level. Here, the one who 
makes the promise is God, calling Abraham to a future filled with blessing. This 
promise moves Abraham to risk everything in the hope that it will be fulfilled. To 
explore the drama that emerges around this theme, we’ll trace the connection of the 
promise to faith, conflict, laughter, and ordeal.
The Promise and Faith


At the beginning of Genesis 12, God gives Abraham his promise, which has 
three parts. First, Abraham is to leave his land, his extended family, and his 
father’s house and go to the land that God will show him. Next, he is told that 
he will be the father of a great nation. Finally, he will be blessed and will be a 
source of blessing for the families of the earth.


Each aspect of the promise creates tension in the narrative between the magnitude 
of the promised future and the improbability that it will ever come about. 
●
●Consider the theme of land. Abraham is told to leave his land and go to a 
place he has never seen. We may wonder why, but the text doesn’t tell us. The 
promise doesn’t even say where the new land is located, only that Abraham 
will know it when he sees it. The whole venture seems problematic.
●
●The same is true of the promise of becoming a great nation. Abraham and 
his wife, Sarah, have no children, and both are growing old. If Abraham is 
to be part of a great nation, we might expect him to stay home, where he 
at least has an extended family. Yet the idea is that he and Sarah will have 
descendants of their own, which seems unlikely for an aging couple.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
18
●
●Finally, to have land and many descendants would be considered a blessing 
in Abraham’s culture, but the promise is that he will also be a blessing to 
all the families of the earth. How that could happen through an obscure 
traveling herder is anything but clear. 
●
●The surprise is that Abraham and Sarah set out. They take the risk and go to 
see what the future might hold.


A gentle sense of irony enters the story here through a series of missteps on the 
part of Abraham. He seems to overshoot the land where God wants him to live. 
In the span of just a few verses, he wanders into and out of the Promised Land, 
then into a series of troubles in Egypt.
●
●In an attempt to protect himself and Sarah from the Egyptians, he tells her 
to say that she is his sister rather than his wife. But as soon as the Egyptians 
arrive, they take Sarah into the king’s royal harem.
●
●The Egyptians treat Abraham well, but his scheme to protect himself has put 
Sarah at risk. And his attempt to secure his own future actually threatens the 
future, because without Sarah, the promise of descendants will not be realized. 
●
●To get things back on track, God afflicts the king’s household with plagues, 
which the king realizes were somehow triggered by Sarah. When he learns 
that Sarah is Abraham’s wife, he sends her back to her husband, then sends 
them both out of Egypt. After this comedy of errors, they make their way 
back to the Promised Land.
●
●This humor in the story is part of the characterization of Abraham. So often, 
he is remembered as an exemplar of faith, and it’s clear that his willingness 
to step into an unknown future is a major part of the story. But at the same 
time, Abraham is a person who can seem woefully shortsighted. His actions 
create as many problems as they solve. This humorous side makes Abraham 
all the more engaging. 
The Promise and Conflict


In chapter 15, an episode takes place that heightens the tension between faith in 
an expansive future and realism about limits in the present. By this point in the 
narrative, time has passed, and Abraham still has no children of his own. God 
might have called him with the promise of becoming a great nation, but so far, 
God has not followed through. 

Lecture 3—Abraham, Sarah, and the Promise 
19


Abraham lets God know that he has now made out his will and has identified 
a household slave as his beneficiary. Given the situation, that’s only realistic. 
God, however, does not listen to reason. Instead, he counters by raising the 
expectation, telling Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the 
stars of heaven. 


On the one hand, Abraham’s experience calls for realism about being 
childless. On the other hand, there’s the promise of countless descendants. 
Being childless calls for resignation; receiving the promise calls for hope. 
Which will it be? This is the point where Abraham again believes. And the 
narrative says that God considered his faith to be “righteousness”—the right 
form of relating to God. 


In chapter 16, more time has passed, and Sarah has become impatient about 
their lack of children. She determines to use a surrogate mother, a slave girl in 
the house named Hagar. Abraham goes along with the scheme, and Hagar soon 
gets pregnant.


Conflict breaks out when Hagar seems to gloat that she has been able to 
conceive, while Sarah has not. Sarah brings up the issue with Abraham, but he 
simply shrugs and tells Sarah to do whatever she wants with the servant girl. 
Sarah mistreats her and humiliates her, until Hagar runs away into the desert, 
pregnant and alone. 
●
●God seeks out Hagar in the desert, and when he hears her story, he makes 
her a promise. He says that Hagar, too, despite all that has occurred, will be 
blessed. The child she is carrying will be a reminder of God’s concern for the 
runaway. The child will be called Ishmael, a name that means “God listens.” 
Through Ishmael, Hagar will be blessed with many descendants.
●
●We have seen that Abraham exhibits both trust and indifference; he’s both 
admirable and flawed. Sarah is complex, as well. Earlier, she was put at risk 
because of Abraham’s scheme in Egypt. Now, she puts Hagar at risk through 
her own schemes and jealousy. It’s within this context of flawed human 
action that God plays the positive role. It’s God’s compassion toward the 
runaway that carries the narrative forward. Divine action opens up a more 
promising future.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
20
People often expect Abraham 
and Sarah to be models of virtue 
in every situation, but in the 
episode with Hagar, Sarah seems 
harsh and Abraham is unfeeling

Lecture 3—Abraham, Sarah, and the Promise 
21
The Promise and Laughter


Chapters 17 and 18 again take up the problem of Abraham and Sarah’s 
childlessness. At the beginning of chapter 17, we are told that Abraham is 
now 99 years old and has been waiting for a child for almost 25 years. It seems 
audacious for God to keep repeating a promise that he has not fulfilled, yet he 
does so for more than half a chapter. He describes a glorious future in which 
Abraham’s many descendants will have a home in the land of Canaan. And he 
now refers to this as his covenant with Abraham. 


As a sign of this covenant relationship, God says that all of Abraham’s male 
descendants should be circumcised on the eighth day after they are born. God 
then concludes his statement about circumcision by saying once again that 
Sarah will become the mother of many nations and kings.


At this point, Abraham simply laughs, because by now, the whole thing seems 
absurd. He is nearly 100 years old, and Sarah is almost 90. Abraham says that 
he’s content now that Hagar has given birth to Ishmael and God should let well 
enough alone. In the face of this laughter, God finally says he will take action. 
In just one more year, he says, Sarah will give birth.


The promise finally comes true in chapter 21, when Abraham and Sarah’s son 
is born. And the theme of this section is apparent in his name: Isaac, meaning 
“he laughs” in Hebrew. The point is that Abraham laughed, then Sarah laughed, 
and now, God gets the last laugh. At Isaac’s birth, Sarah says, “God has brought 
laughter for me. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” In the book of 
Genesis, God is the bringer of laughter, giving a gift that moves beyond the 
delays of the past to a newfound delight in the present.
The Promise and Ordeal


In Genesis 22, God tells Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice. It’s a story 
that’s filled with contradictions. Up to this point, God has been the giver, but 
now he demands that Abraham give Isaac back as a burnt offering that would 
end Isaac’s life. Earlier, his promise had seemed impossible; now, his demand 
does. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
22
In a work called Fear and 
Trembling, the philosopher Søren 
Kierkegaard tried to probe the 
torment that Abraham experienced 
in a situation that could not be 
comprehended in standard categories. 

Lecture 3—Abraham, Sarah, and the Promise 
23


The opening line of this story says that God made this demand to test 
Abraham, but it offers no reason for the test. Instead, there is simply the 
command, which unfolds in excruciating detail. Abraham loves Isaac, yet he 
must put him to death. 


We would expect Abraham to object, but he says nothing. Instead, he silently 
takes Isaac to the mountains, carrying a knife and wood for the sacrifice. Of 
course, Isaac does not know the command that Abraham has been given. He 
innocently asks his father where they will get the lamb for the sacrifice, which 
Abraham tells him that God himself will provide. Is Abraham alluding to the 
fact that because God has given Isaac to him, he is, in a sense, providing the 
sacrifice? Or is he dissembling to hide the truth from his son? Or does he really 
think that God will spare Isaac? 


The text provides no clarity but moves on to the critical moment. Abraham holds 
the knife in one hand and Isaac in the other. At that instant, God intervenes; he 
says, “Don’t stretch out your hand against the boy.” Instead, Abraham sees a ram 
caught in a thicket and sacrifices it. 


What’s particularly striking about this story is the inscrutability of God’s 
ways. He puts Abraham in a situation that defies easy answers. For Abraham 
to disobey God would be wrong. But to be told to sacrifice Isaac also seems 
wrong; it runs counter to everything else he knows about God. Yet despite 
the inscrutable command, God remains true to his own character in the end. 
His commitment is finally for life, not death for Isaac. The story portrays a 
God whose ways are deeply hidden, but whose purpose is ultimately clear. His 
underlying commitment is the giving of life.

LECTURE 4
Jacob, Joseph, and 
Reconciliation
 T 
wo notable features of the narratives of Jacob and Joseph are disguises 
and dreams. Both play an important role in many kinds of literature 
and can serve both positive and negative ends. Dreams, in particular, 
often provide clues to the meaning of the story. In many contexts, dreams are seen 
as a means of divine communication. Some dreams are rather clear, while others are 
cryptic, but with interpretation, even cryptic dreams can disclose the will of God. 
That is the assumption in the stories of Jacob and Joseph. Together, the disguises 
and dreams create an interplay between concealment and disclosure, challenging us 
to ask where we see things clearly and where the truth might be hidden.
Jacob as a Trickster


The trickster is a recurring figure in literature, a clever figure, who gets what 
he wants through deception. Jacob as trickster is introduced in the last half of 
Genesis 25. At this point, Abraham and Sarah’s son Isaac has married a woman 
named Rebekah, and Rebekah has given birth to twins who are as different as 
night and day. 
●
●The first of the twins is Esau, who has a ruddy complexion and is coarse and 
covered with hair. He spends his life outdoors because his passion is hunting, 
for which his father loves him. In Isaac’s eyes, Esau, the older twin, is the 
rightful successor as head of the household.
●
●Jacob, the younger twin, loves the softer side of life. He likes to stay around 
the tent, making conversation by the fireside. Because he is a homebody, he 
is the favorite of his mother, Rebekah. She is determined to make him the 
privileged one. 


The critical moment in the story comes when Isaac knows he is approaching 
death. Nearly blind, he wants to enact a ritual blessing of the son who will 
become head of the household and receive a large inheritance. Isaac tells Esau 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
26
to hunt some wild game and prepare a special meal before he receives the 
blessing. 


Rebekah then moves into action to ensure that Jacob, her favorite son, wins 
out. She contrives a way to conceal Jacob’s identity from the nearly blind Isaac. 
The old man is suspicious at first but is ultimately fooled by the disguise. He 
calls for God to give Jacob the special blessing and unwittingly makes Jacob the 
privileged one in the family.


When Esau discovers the deception, he is livid. Rebekah sends Jacob away to 
stay with family elsewhere until Esau has a chance to calm down. And it’s on 
this journey that God intrudes into the story, choosing to communicate with 
the morally dubious Jacob through a dream. 


As Jacob sleeps that night, he dreams of a ladder that stretches from earth 
to heaven, with the angels of God going up and down. Over the centuries, 
some readers have construed this vision as a vivid description of spiritual life: 
People rise spiritually by humility, which brings them closer to God, while self-
obsession draws people away from God.


Of course, the narrative tells us nothing about the meaning of the angels’ 
movement. Instead, attention centers on what God communicates to Jacob. 
●
●We’ve seen that Jacob is a trickster, who gets what he wants through 
deception. In this context, he’s running away from the conflict at home, 
which his actions have created. Yet the dream gives us a glimpse of God’s 
purposes, which are otherwise hidden by the human flaws and failings that 
dominate the story. 
●
●In the face of human conflict, God’s intent is for something greater. He will 
bring Jacob back to the land that he is now leaving, give him a large family, 
and make him a source of blessing for others. 
Jacob as a Striver


In the second part of the story, Jacob arrives at the home of his mother’s family 
at Haran (southern Turkey). Among the members of this household are two 
young women: Leah, the elder, and Rachel, the younger. Jacob becomes so 

Lecture 4—Jacob, Joseph, and Reconciliation 
27
Many interpreters see the angels’ movement 
up the ladder in Jacob’s dream as representing 
humility—the goal of spiritual life—while 
their downward movement signifies self-
obsession.

28
taken with Rachel that he offers to work for her father for seven years if he only 
will let them get married. And her father agrees—though he’ll fulfill the bargain 
on his own terms, not Jacob’s.


When the time comes for the wedding, Jacob goes into the tent to spend 
the night with his bride. But his new father-in-law has slipped Leah into the 
tent, and in the morning, Jacob discovers that he is now married to the wrong 
woman. Jacob’s father-in-law tells him that he will have to work for another 
seven years to gain Rachel for his wife.


Jacob fulfills this commitment and, by making some shrewd moves, becomes 
a wealthy man. But that, in turn, generates resentment in the extended family. 
With jealousy and conflict rising, Jacob decides to return home, even though it 
means facing Esau.


As Jacob nears his homeland, he sends messengers with gifts for Esau, but he 
remains afraid. We’re told that he spends the night wrestling with a man, but 
we’re not sure who that man is or why the struggle started. The encounter has a 
dreamlike quality, mirroring the struggles that have shaped Jacob’s life. 


As the wrestling goes on, neither is winning. The mysterious man demands 
that Jacob let him go, but Jacob says, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.” 
Finally, the man asks, “What is your name?” When he’s told “Jacob,” the man 
replies, “You will no longer be called Jacob. You will be called Israel, because 
you have striven with God and with human beings and have won.” That’s what 
the name Israel means: “one who strives with God.” 


By wrestling with this mysterious man, Jacob is engaged in a deeper struggle 
with God himself. At the end of the story, Jacob says he’s amazed that when 
wrestling, he saw God face to face yet survived. Note, however, that we’re not 
told God is in the struggle until the end. Instead, we see Jacob pursuing the 
struggle in the hope that it will end in a blessing, which brings life. 


The next day, this surreal encounter comes to fruition in practical terms: when 
Jacob must face a human adversary, Esau. He must swallow his pride and bow 

Lecture 4—Jacob, Joseph, and Reconciliation 
29
down as Esau approaches. And here is where the struggle culminates in a kind 
of blessing, as Esau embraces Jacob in reconciliation. 


Jacob links the two scenes of struggle by telling Esau that “seeing your face is 
like seeing the face of God.” By referring to the face of God, Jacob recalls what 
he said before, when his nighttime grappling with God issued into blessing. 
Seeing the face of God is not an abstract idea for Jacob. It is experienced in the 
moment of reconciliation with his brother. And in both scenes, that recognition 
comes through struggle. 
Joseph and His Brothers


In the third part of the story, we turn to Jacob’s children, especially Joseph. 
The narrative is told in Genesis 37–50, and again, it asks how one discerns the 
purpose of God in the face of persistent human conflict.


As the story begins, we find Jacob playing favorites among his children. It is 
the same pattern that sparked conflict earlier. Jacob has given his a favorite 
son, Joseph, a special coat, engendering resentment among his brothers. Joseph 
makes the problem worse by telling his brothers about dreams he’s had, in 
which he seems to have been put in a position of privilege. 


The brothers get their chance for revenge when they take their flocks to a pasture 
some distance from home. They sell Joseph into slavery to some merchants 
who will take him to Egypt. Joseph’s brothers disguise what they have done 
by covering his special coat with goat’s blood and showing it to Jacob, who 
concludes that his son has been killed by a wild animal.


In Egypt, Joseph is purchased by a servant of the pharaoh and, before long, 
becomes an overseer. The Egyptian’s wife becomes attracted to the young slave 
and tries to draw him into her bedroom. Joseph refuses her advances, but she 
persists, grabbing the cloak he is wearing. Joseph panics and slips away, leaving 
his cloak in her hand. 


The woman then shows Joseph’s cloak to her husband and accuses him of 
making advances on her. The Egyptian is outraged and has Joseph locked up in 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
30
prison. In terms of the plot, Joseph has gone from the status of a privileged son, 
to a slave, to a prisoner. He has reached the low point of his life.


But here, the plot makes a decisive turn for the better, and significantly, 
this positive movement starts with dreams. Having gained a reputation for 
interpreting dreams, Joseph is summoned to the pharaoh, who has been 
having troubling dreams. Joseph warns that the dreams foretell poor harvests 
in the coming years. He advises the pharaoh to appoint overseers to set aside 
surplus grain during the years of good harvests to ensure a sufficient supply in

slavery and convince their father that 
he has been killed, their deception 
initially works, but they will be 
victims of concealments yet to come.

Lecture 4—Jacob, Joseph, and Reconciliation 
31
the hard years that will follow. The pharaoh appoints Joseph as the overseer 
of the grain supply—a remarkable rise from the status of prisoner to royal 
official. 
The Brothers’ Return


When the famine foretold by the pharaoh’s dreams finally arrives, Egypt is well 
supplied with grain, but elsewhere, food is running out; in Canaan, where 
Joseph’s family lived, the situation is desperate. To prevent starvation, his 
brothers travel to Egypt to buy grain. When they approach Joseph to make 
their request, they don’t recognize him because he’s dressed like an Egyptian 
official. Joseph takes advantage of this unintended disguise to find out whether 
his brothers have changed at all. 


Joseph tests his brothers in various ways, but things reach a crisis point when 
it appears that the youngest brother, Benjamin, will have to suffer for a crime 
he didn’t commit. Then, one of the other brothers steps forward and says that 
he will serve Benjamin’s punishment. At that, Joseph can no longer hide his 
feelings; he reveals that he is not an Egyptian official but their brother. By 
concealing his identity, he learns that the brothers are ready to sacrifice their 
own well-being for the well-being of another.

We see again the movement from conflict to reconciliation, and the movement is 
completed when Joseph has the brothers bring their father, Jacob, to Egypt. Joseph 
uses his position to help the family settle in Egypt, where they find refuge from the 
famine. The story ends with a kind of symmetry: In the beginning, Joseph came to 
Egypt as a victim and a slave owing to his brothers’ jealousy. In the end, he invites 
the brothers to join him in Egypt, which is now their place of safety and hope.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Which aspects of Jacob’s character seem to be most positive? Which seem to 
be most negative? How is God’s relationship with Jacob characterized in the 
narrative? 
2.	 The Joseph story concludes by saying that what his brothers intended for 
evil, God intended for good, in order to preserve the lives of many people 
(Gen. 50:20). How does that shape the way we understand the story as a 
whole? What might be helpful or unhelpful ways for readers to relate that 
perspective to other situations?

LECTURE 5
Moses and the Drama of 
Exodus
 T 
his lecture focuses on a narrative that has a defining role in the 
Bible: the story of Moses and the Exodus. In this story, the people 
of Israel are held in bondage by a harsh Egyptian pharaoh, but God 
sends Moses to demand their release, and eventually, they escape. Strikingly, this 
story both encourages and threatens. It encourages those who see themselves as 
oppressed, fostering a willingness to resist and generating hope for change. But 
it also threatens those in positions of power, undermining their sense of strength 
and privilege. And it includes disturbing reversals, in which the perpetrators 
of violence become the victims of violence. Freedom for some means a loss of 
control or death for others. 
The Setting of Exodus


The book of Exodus opens by recalling the migration of the family of Jacob 
(Israel) from the land of Canaan into Egypt that we discussed in the last lecture. 
After a conflict, the family had been reconciled in Egypt, where they made a 
good living and their numbers increased for many generations. 


But then a major political change occurs: “Now a new king, who did not know 
Joseph, came to power in Egypt” (Exod. 1:8). Up to this time, the rulers of 
Egypt had accepted the descendants of Israel, even though they were once 
foreigners. But the new king believes that in a war, these one-time foreigners 
might side with his enemies. Thus, he tries to suppress them. 


The pharaoh forces the people of Israel to work on his building projects, but 
even this slave labor is not enough to ease his fears. He starts a brutal campaign 
to control the Hebrew population, ordering that whenever Hebrew women give 
birth, the midwives are to kill the male children. Because the midwives revere 
God, they refuse to obey the king’s command. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
34


This introduces the basic conflict that will be worked out in the rest of the 
story. It is not primarily a conflict between two ethnic groups, the Israelites 
and Egyptians. Rather, it is a conflict between the will of the pharaoh—for 
oppression—and the will of God—for deliverance. 
Moses


Exodus 2 begins with Moses’s birth, then shifts to his life as an adult, where we 
begin to see the tensions in his character. In Exodus 2:11, he sees an Egyptian 
beating a Hebrew; he intervenes and ends up killing the Egyptian. One might 
see that as bold, but it’s also clear that Moses realizes his action will come to the 
attention of the authorities and he must escape from Egypt to save his own life. 
Thus, Moses is both outraged at violence and a contributor to violence. He is 
both bold and fearful. 


Moses flees from Egypt to the desert regions to the east. There, he marries one 
of the local women and works as a shepherd. One day, he is herding his flock 
in the desert, when he sees a flame blaze up from a bush. He approaches the 
burning bush and hears a voice calling him by name. This is the encounter with 
God that changes the course of Moses’s life. In it, God discloses his identity yet 
retains a cloak of mystery. 
●
●God first identifies himself in relational terms. He is the God of Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob—the early ancestors of Israel. Thus, the God who speaks to 
Moses is no stranger. 
●
●Then, God extends that relationship from the past into the present. He’s 
seen the misery of the people who are enslaved in Egypt and has heard 
them cry for help. He now intends to lead them out of slavery to a land 
that will become their home—the land he had promised to Abraham. This 
commitment to rescue the people who suffer enslavement is integral to 
God’s character.


Moses is hesitant and wants to know God’s name; here, we find the most 
cryptic element in the story. God’s name is more than just a label; it conveys 
identity. How much is God willing to disclose? He tells Moses, “I am who 
I am.” The name seems to conceal as much as it reveals. God simply calls 
himself “I Am.”

Lecture 5—Moses and the Drama of Exodus 
35
In artistic depictions, Moses has a 
face that conveys both intensity and 
control, but in the biblical narrative, 
he is a more complex human being, 
both bold and evasive.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
36


God may be the existent one who has announced that he will free the people from 
slavery, but his first major obstacle is Moses, who turns out to be an uncooperative 
prophet. As soon as God commands Moses to lead the people out of slavery, 
Moses objects, claiming that the people won’t listen to him and that he can’t 
speak in front of the pharaoh. Finally, God grows impatient. His intent is to free 
the people, yet he can’t get on with it because his chosen prophet keeps making 
excuses. Exasperated, God tells Moses to take his brother Aaron along to help out. 
The Pharaoh


In the third part of the narrative, the pharaoh emerges as a major figure. Here, 
the story subverts the iconic picture of an Egyptian ruler with absolute power. 
The pharaoh has pretensions to invincible power, but in his contest of wills with 
God, those pretensions will come undone. 


Moses goes to Egypt to meet the pharaoh and demand the release of the people 
from slavery. But the pharaoh commands the taskmasters to make the slaves 
work even harder. Moses then calls for 10 plagues or disasters to fall upon Egypt. 
After each plague, the pharaoh responds; the key to following the narrative is to 
watch how these interactions unfold. 


In Exodus 7:14, it is clear that the pharaoh is obstinate. A common English 
translation is that his heart remains “hardened.” Thus, Moses announces the 
first plague: The water of the Nile will turn to blood. With the second plague—
frogs swarming out of the river—the pharaoh vacillates. He offers to let the 
people make a sacrifice if their God will take the frogs away. Moses does as the 
pharaoh asks, but when things improve, the ruler hardens his heart again. The 
pattern is repeated through successive plagues.


The interaction becomes more complex with a plague of sickness and painful 
sores on people and livestock. In this case, the narrator says that God is the one 
who hardens pharaoh’s heart. It’s a striking comment that underscores the limits 
of the pharaoh’s control. Not only is he losing his grip on the people, but he is 
losing his grip on himself. God can do what he wishes with the pharaoh’s heart. 
And by hardening it, God keeps pharaoh engaged in the contest. 

Lecture 5—Moses and the Drama of Exodus 
37


The pattern continues through plagues of thunder and hail, locusts and darkness. 
The narrative relentlessly subverts the pharaoh’s pretensions to absolute power 
and control. When the pressure mounts, he wavers and promises; when it eases 
up, he resists. Sometimes, he hardens his own heart; sometimes, God does it for 
him. The pharaoh is caught in a situation he can’t control, and it will lead to the 
demise of his oppressive regime.
The Passover


In chapter 11, God warns of the final plague: At midnight, he will go through the 
land of Egypt, and the firstborn in every Egyptian household will die, from those 
in the pharaoh’s household to slaves and livestock. But God will spare the people 
of Israel. He will “pass over” the houses of the Israelites and will not harm them. 


This final plague shows a chilling circular movement in the story. At this 
point, the kind of violence that pharaoh tried to inflict on others comes back 
to strike him. At the beginning of the story, the pharaoh had ordered that all 
the male children born to the people of Israel were to be killed. Now, at the 
end of the story, the pharaoh will be the victim of the violence he once tried 
to inflict. 


The narrative invites us to see the story from the perspective of the Israelites, 
who now prepare for this moment of deliverance. This is where the tradition of 
the Passover comes from. The Israelites are told to slaughter one lamb for each 
household. They are to mark their doorposts with the lamb’s blood as a sign to 
God to save those inside. The meat from the lamb is to be roasted and eaten 
with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.


In Exodus 12, the fateful night arrives, and the plague strikes the households 
of Egypt. The death of the firstborn brings the pharaoh to the breaking point, 
and he tells Moses to take the people and leave the country. The release of the 
slaves shows the pharaoh’s loss of authority. And that is the disturbing side of 
Exodus—a vivid reminder of the difficulty of change. Few of us are ready to 
relinquish control when we think we have it. And at the moment of letting go, 
we must face the limits of our own power. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
38


In the final part of the story, the Israelites flee, but the pharaoh changes his 
mind yet again and leads his army in hot pursuit. The escaping slaves come 
to the sea with the chariots of Egypt behind them. We sense that all hope for 
deliverance is about to vanish. 


But here, the narrative shifts the level of the drama. It’s not primarily a conflict 
between the Israelites and the Egyptians but between the wills of God and the 
pharaoh and between their two different forms of power. To demonstrate that, 
deliverance is brought about by God’s action. 
●
●Moses tells the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand your ground, and see the 
deliverance the Lord will bring for you today.” Then he adds, “The Lord will 
fight for you. You have only to be still.” 
●
●This is one of the most peculiar battle scenes in the Bible. In it, victory is not 
won by force of arms. The people of Israel are simply to stand their ground. 
What they need is a way forward, and that is what they are given. 


Moses stretches out his staff over the sea, and the water parts. The people of 
Israel follow the path through to the other side. The Egyptian army follows, 
but halfway across, their chariot wheels get clogged with mud. Moses stretches 
out his hand, and the water flows back to its normal place, covering the 
Egyptians. 


The narrative has culminated in a dramatic reversal. At the beginning, the 
pharaoh wanted the Hebrew children thrown into the Nile. In the end, his 
chariots are thrown into the sea. His efforts to keep the Israelites enslaved have 
failed, while God’s efforts to free them have succeeded.

LECTURE 6
Freedom and Law at Mount 
Sinai
 T 
he story of Israel at Mount Sinai is set, in one sense, in the desert, where 
the landscape is barren. But in another sense, the story is set in a complex 
network of relationships, both human and divine. It’s a narrative in which 
people must come to terms with their environment, their God, and themselves. The 
problem that runs throughout this narrative is freedom. The backdrop is the story of 
the Exodus, and in the Exodus, freedom was the goal. At that time, the slaves wanted 
liberation, and that’s what the Exodus provided. But the Mount Sinai story asks what 
happens next: Now that the people are free, what shape does freedom take?
The Issue of Survival


As the story opens in Exodus 16, the Israelites who were once enslaved in Egypt 
have been set free. They’re journeying eastward out of Egypt and have come to 
the Sinai Desert, where they now face the problem of survival. 


The people are “complaining” against Moses and his brother Aaron, wondering 
what good freedom is if they’re all going to starve in the desert. Of course, it 
isn’t the case that life was secure back when they were slaves in Egypt. Instead, 
the people have created a fantasy, but they are now outraged and blame Moses 
for taking them away from the “blessings” of slavery and bringing them into 
the desert. 


This creates a crisis. The people are reimagining the past, but the larger issue 
is how they are going to have a future. They’re focused on dying, but the real 
question is how they are going to live. The plot advances when God opens up 
the future by promising to give the people bread from heaven. 
●
●As we read on, we learn that in the morning, everything is wet with dew. 
When the dew evaporates, it leaves a fine, white, flakey substance on the

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
42
ground, which comes to be called manna. The people find that manna tastes 
like wafers made with honey. 
●
●Manna lasts only for a day, but the people gather it in the morning and eat 
it during the day. If they try to keep it overnight, it becomes rotten and 
infested with worms. The one exception is the Sabbath, when God wants 
people to rest. Before the Sabbath, God has people gather enough manna to 
last through the next day, and during the Sabbath, it doesn’t spoil. 
●
●Of course, we can see that manna has become more than a means of survival. 
In this narrative, it creates a paradigm for a way of life. The people will have 
what they need but not more than what they need. They receive the manna 
as a gift but cannot secure their own future by hoarding it.
The Ten Commandments


The second part of the story begins with a description of God’s overwhelming 
presence on Mount Sinai. There is thunder and lightning, and the mountain is 
engulfed in smoke. And here, God gives the law or Torah (“instruction”) to Israel. 


Before any commandments are given, there is a reminder of God’s identity. He 
is the one who brought liberation from slavery, and this identity is essential 
for everything that follows. If God is the one who brings freedom, then what 
follows has to do with living out that freedom. 


The First Commandment tells us that that the heart of freedom in this context 
is relationship. When God brought people out of slavery, that act of liberation 
expressed his commitment to them. And the appropriate response is that the 
people are to be committed to God. Thus, he tells them they should have no 
other gods before him. 


The next directive is that people are not to make images of things to worship, an 
extension of the idea that they are not to have other gods. 


The next commandment is not to take the name of God in vain. The idea is 
that God’s name conveys his identity and authority; people are not to claim the 
authority of God for things that are untrue, manipulative, or degrading. 

Lecture 6—Freedom and Law at Mount Sinai 
43


Next is the commandment to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. The 
commandment creates freedom for rest, which contributes to the well-being of 
each individual. 


The next commandment is to honor one’s father and mother. It’s designed to 
foster respect within families and to underscore the need for people to help and 
support those who are older. 
In the Bible, the Ten 
Commandments are referred to as 
“words,” or devarim (Hebrew).

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
44


The next commandment has traditionally been translated, “You shall not kill,” 
but many translations now say, “You shall not murder.” The Hebrew word used 
here is ratsakh, which is used for murder and manslaughter, not for taking 
someone’s life in battle or self-defense. The purpose of the command is to 
protect human life, and that’s consistent with freedom. It creates a safe space in 
which people can live and work.


The next commandment is not to commit adultery. It assumes that engaging 
in sexual relationships with someone else’s spouse is not an acceptable use of 
freedom. The prohibition of adultery contributes to the integrity of one’s own 
marriage and protects the marriages of others.


We can see a pattern emerging. The next commandment is “You shall not steal.” 
And the idea is that taking someone else’s possessions is not a proper use of 
freedom. The commandment after that is “You shall not bear false witness,” 
intending to protect people from false claims that will damage them.


The final commandments turn from wrongful actions to the underlying 
desires that lead to such actions. They tell people not to covet their neighbor’s 
belongings and to restrain their desires before they lead to actions that threaten 
the well-being of others. 


The commandments rule out behaviors and desires that damage relationships, 
but they don’t give guidance about what people are to do in each situation. 
By ruling out idolatry, murder, theft, and so on, they create a sphere in which 
relationships can flourish. But they also assume that people must now discern 
how that flourishing can take place. 
Rebellion


In chapter 24, Moses tells the people that God is prepared to make his covenant 
with them. This covenant will bind them to God in the relationship outlined 
by the commandments. Moses conducts a ceremony in which the covenant is 
formally accepted.

Lecture 6—Freedom and Law at Mount Sinai 
45


Moses then goes back up the mountain to receive instructions about how to 
build a sanctuary. But the people begin to grow restive because he is taking so 
long. They tell Moses’s brother Aaron to make gods for them, and he fashions 
the image of a golden calf. This is a rejection of the covenant the people have 
just made. 


God’s response is explosive anger. He is so outraged that he now wants to 
destroy these people, but Moses stops him, telling God that destroying them 
would violate God’s own commitments. After all, God had brought them out of 
Egypt and was committed to their well-being. If he now slaughters them, it will 
run counter to his most basic reasoning. And God agrees. He changes his mind, 
moving from anger to restraint. 


But now, Moses moves from restraint to outrage. He marches down the 
mountain, shatters the two stone tablets, destroys the golden calf, and has the 
people who are loyal to him slaughter 3,000 of the idolaters. 


What seems striking about this story are the remarkable changes that everyone 
undergoes. The people go from commitment to rebellion; God goes from outrage 
to restraint; and Moses goes from rational negotiation to violence. The most 
instructive element is not in the portrayal of Moses but in the portrayal of God. 
●
●The narrative pictures a God who is capable of both anger and restraint. 
And in chapter 33, things even go a step further. Here, God’s anger is still 
restrained but intense. He tells Moses that he’ll enable the people to continue 
on their journey, but he won’t go with them. 
●
●Moses reverts to his role as intercessor and asks God to reconsider. He recalls 
God’s basic commitment to the well-being of the people, and God again 
relents. He reaffirms his commitment and formalizes it on two new tablets of 
stone, inscribed with the words of his covenant. 
●
●The relationships in this world are not static but dynamic. There is senseless 
betrayal, intense emotion, and a struggle to find a way forward. The 
story does not attempt to explain why the people violated their covenant 
commitments. Rather, it asks how things can move beyond the shattered 
relationship to a new beginning. In this story, divine anger threatens to close 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
46
off the future. Hope emerges with the reaffirmation of that underlying bond 
to which God was committed. 
Worship


In the final part of the story, the covenant relationship takes shape in worship. 
While the people were building the golden calf, Moses was on the mountain 
receiving instructions about the building of a sanctuary. This tabernacle was to 
be a kind of tent so that it could be carried by the people on their journey 
through the desert. 


The narrative describes the building of this sanctuary as the people’s response to 
God’s reaffirmation of the covenant. Chapter 35 tells us that people contributed 
whatever they could to the project because their hearts were stirred and their 
spirits were willing. It’s portrayed as a voluntary effort, a collective response by 
the people, reflecting their own renewed commitment to the covenant. 


The design of the sanctuary was to reflect the structure of relationships. It was 
a rectangle, divided into two parts, and its inner room was the most sacred. It 
was called the Holy of Holies and was where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. 
In considering this design, it’s helpful to think about the way that space orients 
relationships. 
●
●In many Christian churches, the buildings are orientated toward the front, 
where there is a cross. That orientation conveys a relationship to God that is 
centered on Jesus, especially his death and resurrection. 
●
●For Muslims, the worship space is a mosque, which has a niche or mihrab in the 
front wall. That niche shows the direction toward Mecca, where Muhammad 
initially delivered his message and toward which people are to pray.
●
●The book of Exodus describes a sanctuary in which the box containing the 
covenant is in the most important place, and that space was not accessible 
to everyone. But Exodus says that the sanctuary was in the center of the 
camp, with people living all around it. And when they broke camp and 
moved to another location, they took this tent-like sanctuary with them. 
This portable sanctuary reflects the idea that God was not bound to a 
place but to a people. What defined their relationship was not location but 
commitments.

LECTURE 7
Israel’s Wandering in the 
Wilderness
 T 
he books Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy draw on traditional 
materials that were written and revised a long time ago, yet in their 
current literary form, they give a sense of movement. Leviticus is set at 
Mount Sinai, where Moses and the people have gathered after their Exodus from 
Egypt. Numbers continues the journey from Mount Sinai through the desert. And 
Deuteronomy brings the story to the edge of the Promised Land. At each step, we 
also find dominant themes. In Leviticus, it’s holiness; in Numbers, it’s rebellion and 
rebirth; and in Deuteronomy, it’s a summons to devotion.
Leviticus


The book of Leviticus includes a wide variety of regulations, but the central 
concern is with holiness. In the first 10 chapters, attention centers on the 
practice of sacrifice. These opening sections concentrate on how a sacrifice 
should be made, but they don’t address the question of why. It seems clear that 
sacrifices may be given to express joy or gratitude at something good that has 
happened in a person’s life. But there is no explanation in Leviticus about why 
things are to be done in a particular way.


That question continues in the chapters that follow. Leviticus tells how sacrifices 
are to be offered for someone’s sin to be forgiven, but it never explains why 
sacrifices must be offered to receive forgiveness. Instead, Leviticus simply 
assumes that expressions of gratitude and requests for forgiveness should take 
tangible form. 


Leviticus 16 gives us a sense of these sacrifices. This passage deals with Yom 
Kippur (the Day of Atonement), the one time of year that the high priest would 
enter the most holy inner chamber of the sanctuary. Through the sacrifice of a 

Lecture 7—Israel’s Wandering in the Wilderness 
49
bull and a goat, the priest would make atonement for his own sins and the sins 
of the people.


We can think of a sacrifice as a kind of gift, and in human life, gifts play an 
important role—a tangible way to convey friendship or gratitude. When a 
relationship is damaged, giving also has a place. If a trust has been violated or 
something hurtful has been done, we might seek to repair the relationship by what 
we say and through an act of giving. Leviticus takes that idea into the realm of the 
holy. Through tangible gifts, Israel’s relationship to God is given sacred form. 
Numbers


The book of Numbers gets its name because there are two points at which 
Moses takes a census of the people. The first census, in chapter 1, focuses on 
the people who came out of Egypt, the generation that’s now traveling through 
the Sinai Desert. The second census is in chapter 26, and it lists those who were 
not born in Egypt but in the desert. They are the generation that will enter the 
Promised Land. Thus, the book takes us through the death of one generation 
and the birth of a new one. 


Numbers starts with a positive tone. The initial census is an inventory of military 
strength, and the results are impressive. Israel seems to have a large fighting 
force and a well-ordered way of life. With everything in place, the people are 
ready to go from Mount Sinai to the Promised Land of Canaan. 


In chapter 9, we see God’s presence pictured as a numinous cloud that hovers over 
the sanctuary. When the cloud moves forward, the people are to break camp and 
move forward. The idea is that God is leading them. The positive tone crescendos 
in chapter 10, where they set out on what seems to be a triumphal march.


Then, in chapter 11, the story takes a negative turn. Complaining and resistance 
characterize Israel’s experience in the wilderness until chapter 25. The narrative 
shows how the people’s own contentiousness threatens to close off their future. 
●
●By this point in the story, God has been providing food, in the form of manna, 
for quite some time. Now, in Numbers 11, they are tired of eating manna and 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
50
fantasize again about a past that never existed. They picture their former lives 
as slaves as a time when they feasted on fish, fruit, and vegetables. 
●
●As readers, we can see that this is fantasy, but it’s generating conflict that calls 
the future into question. Instead of moving forward, the people are looking 
back, and the journey has ground to a halt. The divine response takes the 
form of a judgment, in which the people get what they want, and it becomes 
their undoing. 


In chapters 13 and 14, Moses sends spies into Canaan to bring back a report 
about the richness of the land. When they return, they describe the place as a 
land flowing with milk and honey. For those who have been traveling through 
the desert, it’s like a dream come true. But then the spies add that other groups 
are living in Canaan—and everything comes apart. The people refuse to move 
forward. They are certain that continuing the journey into the land will end in 
disaster; thus, they decide to turn back to Egypt. 


It’s important to read this episode within the large narrative arc, which began 
with Israel’s Exodus from Egypt. The Exodus occurred because the people 
were enslaved and wanted freedom, and God gave them freedom. Then they 
complained about food, and God gave them manna. Now they are complaining 
about life in the desert, so God promises to lead them into the land of milk and 
honey. But they refuse to go and want to return to the land of slavery. 


In response, God must deal with his own explosive anger. He asks Moses, “How 
long will this people despise me? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in 
spite of everything I’ve done for them?” As readers, we’re challenged to see and 
even feel things from God’s perspective. 


As he did at Mount Sinai, Moses reminds God that God has committed himself 
to this people and he needs to forgive them. And remarkably, God agrees. But he 
adds that he will also do what the people have asked. They have said they’d rather 
die in the desert than move ahead to the land of Canaan. Thus, God will let 
them die in the desert; he will take the next generation into the Promised Land. 


This is the pivotal moment in the story. It’s crucial to see the correlation between 
what the people ask for and what they receive. If they’d rather die in the desert, 

Lecture 7—Israel’s Wandering in the Wilderness 
51
then they can. They are rejecting the future that’s being offered to them, and they’re 
allowed to have their way. It’s a moment that raises questions for the readers: What 
does it mean to get what you ask for? Will it actually be the future you want? 


As the narrative continues, the years pass in the desert. Eventually, there is 
movement forward, when the people of Israel win a military victory over a city 
near the south edge of Canaan. Ultimately, the narrative builds the impression 
that things have finally turned toward success, and it seems that the people are 
poised to enter the land of Canaan.


But then the people commit apostasy by worshipping one of the local deities. 
From the narrator’s perspective, it is one more act of rebellion against God. The 
implication is that if there is to be a future in the land of Canaan, it will have to 
happen despite the persistent unfaithfulness of the people. 


This is the point where the second census is taken (Num. 26). At the end of the 
census, the narrator says that none of those listed belonged to the generation that 
came out of Egypt. The generation that wanted to die in the wilderness has been 
allowed to do so. And the way is now open for the new generation to move ahead. 
Deuteronomy


In Deuteronomy, the people of Israel have arrived at the edge of the Promised 
Land, just east of the Jordan River. True to the reports of Israel’s spies, the land 
has flowing streams and fields of wheat. For the people in the desert, the future 
on the other side of the Jordan River now beckons them.


Despite this sense of anticipation, the tone of Deuteronomy is somber. The book 
is written in the form of Moses’s farewell address to the people Israel. Like others 
of his generation, he will not enter the Promised Land but die in the desert. In 
this farewell address, he reviews what brought the people to this point, then gives 
the new generation directives about how to live in the time to come. 


The name Deuteronomy means “second law,” the idea being that the book 
restates and elaborates the law that Israel received at Mount Sinai. The concern 
in Deuteronomy is that the covenant made in the past will now shape life in the 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
52
future. In chapter 5, Moses states the Ten Commandments for a second time 
and makes them the center of this book. 


The hearers are instructed to teach the commandments to their children and to 
explain that God gave them the commandments so that life might go well with 
them. The goal is the well-being of the community. 
Moses’s farewell address in 
Deuteronomy continues to 
resonate with many Jewish people 
today; he seeks to ensure that a 
sense of devotion to God be passed 
on to the generations that follow.

Lecture 7—Israel’s Wandering in the Wilderness 
53


Yet as we keep reading, we find a notable tension in Deuteronomy in the 
depiction of Israel’s relationship to outsiders. 
●
●Chapter 7 tells us that God chose the people of Israel because he loved them. 
It was out of love and devotion that he brought Israel out of slavery. And 
having conveyed his love to them, God now directs them to love him in 
return. That makes sense. 
●
●But just before this in chapter 7, there is a stark reminder that for the people 
of Israel to possess the land, they need to drive out the people who are 
already living there. It’s a militant passage that tells of Israel conquering the 
people of Canaan and showing them no mercy.
●
●Then, in chapter 10, a more gracious element reappears—a reiteration of God’s 
love for Israel and the importance of showing love for God. The text adds that 
God also loves outsiders. Because God loved Israel’s ancestors when they were 
aliens, they are to do the same for the aliens in their own community. 
●
●In the same book, there are passages that call for wholehearted devotion 
toward God and harsh tactics against other nations. And Deuteronomy does 
not resolve that tension. At the end of the book, Moses finishes the speech 
and blesses the people. He dies and is buried, though the narrative says that 
no one ever learned where his grave was located.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Leviticus centers on questions of what is sacred or holy. What aspects of the 
book seem most different from what people today might associate with the 
sacred? Are there connections with the way people think of the sacred today?
2.	 Deuteronomy focuses on the call for devotion to God. How does Deuteronomy 
elaborate what such devotion entails? How does Deuteronomy understand the 
implications of devotion to God for relationships among people?

LECTURE 8
Violence and Kindness in the 
Promised Land
 A 
s you recall, Joshua led the people of Israel into Canaan, capturing 
the cities of the Promised Land. For many readers, this is a disturbing 
account of violent conquest. Some interpreters have tried to move 
beyond the violence by relegating it to the past. Others reject the book because 
it seems to commend violence. As an alternative approach, we’ll compare Joshua 
to Judges and Ruth. Judges is a haunting account of the tragic side of violence. It 
begins with heroism but ends in a tragic civil war. The book of Ruth then shows 
a remarkable openness to outsiders. In this lecture, let’s ask what it means to have 
these three viewpoints side by side. 
Joshua


The story of Joshua opens as the people of Israel approach the Jordan River. 
Moses is now dead, and the people are being led by Joshua, a warrior. In the 
opening chapter, Joshua is told to be faithful to God and God will be faithful 
to him. This call for obedience is a central theme of the book, and Joshua 
exemplifies it. 


Joshua’s first challenge will be the city of Jericho. Here, the priests lead a 
procession across the Jordan River. When their feet touch the water, the river 
stops flowing so the people can walk across on dry land. Next, the priests lead a 
procession around the city of Jericho once each day for six days. On the seventh 
day, they march around the city seven times. The trumpets sound, the people 
shout, and the walls of Jericho come tumbling down. 


The collapse of the walls is followed by Joshua’s men utterly destroying the 
city and the people in it. The practice is called cherem in Hebrew. It means 
that something is completely given over to God. No one is allowed to take any 
plunder after the battle. Instead, everything is destroyed. 

Lecture 8—Violence and Kindness in the Promised Land 
55


After this victory, Joshua assumes that it will be easy to capture the next city, 
which is called Ai. Yet when his men attack it, they are defeated. Joshua discerns 
the reason for defeat is that someone violated the practice of cherem. Joshua has 
the soldier executed and is then able to capture the city.


Joshua’s triumphs continue until he has conquered the land and allocated 
different regions to the people of Israel. In the final chapter, the people assemble 
in the middle of the country, at a place called Shechem. There, Joshua reaffirms 
his covenant bond with God. He recalls how God brought them out of Egypt 
and into the land of Canaan, and he voices his own loyalty to the God who gave 
him victory. He says, “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” 


When taken on its own, this final chapter lifts up the values of loyalty 
and gratitude. It recounts how God has been faithful to the people, and it 
emphasizes the importance of their being faithful to him. But what’s disturbing 
is that fidelity to God is shown by violent conquest of other people. If that’s 
what faithfulness to God means, it seems like an invitation to oppression. 
Historically, we’re not sure 
what Jericho looked like in 
the period of Joshua, but the 
narrative pictures a formidable 
walled city that would have 
been difficult to capture.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
56
Judges


Scholars have often noted that where Joshua depicts triumph, Judges discloses 
vulnerability. And where Joshua celebrates faithfulness, Judges show a pattern of 
unfaithfulness within Israel. In chapter 2, Judges outlines a cycle of actions and 
consequences that occur repeatedly. 
●
●The cycle in chapter 2 is that first people turn away from the God of Israel 
and worship the gods of other nations. Second, God allows Israel to be 
dominated by those other nations. The idea is that if the people worship 
other gods, they will be ruled by other nations, and the narrative shows them 
being threatened by groups from the surrounding region. 
●
●Third, the people ask God to deliver them. And fourth, God raises up a 
military leader who defeats their enemies. Then the cycle begins again.


One example of this cycle comes from Judges 4, in which the narrator tells us 
that people did evil in the sight of the Lord. In response, God allows Israel to be 
oppressed by the Canaanite king, who has a general named Sisera. The people 
then call to their God for help, and God raises up Deborah to lead them. 
●
●She is a prophet, which means that she communicates the word of God to 
people. She is also a judge, who deals with issues among the people of Israel. 
Deborah appoints a man named Barak to lead the Israelite warriors, but 
he’s hesitant, and he agrees only when Deborah assures him that she will go 
with him. 
●
●The armies of Israel clash with those of Sisera, and as Sisera’s chariots 
advance, it seems like certain defeat for the Israelites. But at the critical 
moment, the sky opens up and there is a rainstorm. The rain turns the field 
into mud, and the heavy chariots get stuck. Sisera’s army then flees with the 
Israelites in hot pursuit.


But the results of Deborah’s victory do not last. The cycle of unfaithfulness and 
oppression takes place again, until we come to the judge named Samson. What 
people often miss in the story of Samson is the fact that violence here takes on 
a different role. Deborah led a military response to a national crisis. But for 
Samson, violence is a tool for personal revenge. 
●
●In chapter 13, the people of Israel have again turned away from God and are 
dominated by the Philistines. The people of Israel had come from the east 

Lecture 8—Violence and Kindness in the Promised Land 
57
Samson belonged to a group 
called the Nazirites, who were 
set apart for special service to 
God; as a sign of this role, they 
did not cut their hair.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
58
and claimed cities in the central part of the country. Samson lives along the 
border, where the two groups came together. 
●
●Samson is passionate about a Philistine woman and insists on marrying 
her, despite their ethnic differences. But in the aftermath of the wedding, 
Samson’s bride tells the answer to a riddle he has posed, and he is outraged. 
In retaliation, he goes to a Philistine city and slaughters 30 men. He then 
sets fire to the Philistine fields. The Philistines, in turn, kill the bride and her 
father for provoking the situation. 
●
●Things continue in this way until Samson falls in love with another Philistine 
woman. She learns that the secret to his strength is that his hair has never 
been cut. Thus, while Samson is sleeping, the Philistines cut off his hair and 
gouge out his eyes. 
●
●But as Samson’s hair grows back and his strength returns, he has one more 
chance for revenge. One day, the Philistines have a party and force Samson to 
stand before them so they can ridicule him. As they do so, Samson pulls down 
the columns supporting the roof of the house. In this final act of revenge, the 
roof collapses and destroys both the Philistines and Samson himself. 


What is the story telling us about the use of violence? In some scenes, the 
narrator seems to relish the way Samson retaliates against the Philistines, 
but we can also see a downward spiral in which violence becomes a tool for 
personal revenge. This pattern of destruction culminates in the final chapters of 
Judges, where the violence is no longer turned outward but inward, and Israel is 
engulfed in civil war. 
●
●In chapter 19, when a man and a woman he’s living with quarrel, she storms 
out of the house and goes to her parents. After a while, they patch things 
up and decide to head home, spending the night at a house along the way. 
That night, some men from the town want to gang rape the man. To placate 
them, he shoves the woman out to them instead.
●
●In the morning, the woman is lying dead on the ground. In a distressing 
but cunning move to avenge himself against the perpetrators, the man cuts 
the woman’s body in pieces. Then messengers carry the parts of her body to 
different groups around the country, and the people decide to take vengeance 
against the town where the gang rape took place. 
●
●A war ensues, and the people of Israel nearly obliterate the tribe to which 
the perpetrators of the crime belonged. The violence that was once turned 

Lecture 8—Violence and Kindness in the Promised Land 
59
outward is now turned inward. The threat to the people of Israel’s well-being 
comes not from foreign oppressors but from the cycles of violence within 
their own society. The triumphant picture of conquest we saw in Joshua is 
gone. Judges could celebrate Deborah’s victory on the battlefield, but by the 
end, patterns of brutality are destroying Israel’s own society. 
Ruth


The story of Ruth introduces us to a man named Elkanah and his wife, Naomi. 
They live in the town of Bethlehem in the southern part of Israel. But because a 
famine is taking place, they are moving to the land of Moab. There, they are the 
foreigners, yet they find a place to live, and their sons marry women from Moab.


As time passes, Elkanah and his sons die, and Naomi and her two daughters-in-
law, Ruth and Orpah, become widows. Naomi decides to return to Bethlehem 
in the hope of finding help from her extended family there.


As she prepares to leave, her daughters-in-law are grief stricken. They have 
a close bond with Naomi and insist that they want to come along with her. 
But Naomi tells them to return to their families in the hope that they might 
eventually marry again. The young women face the dilemma of what to do.


Orpah honors Naomi’s wishes and turns back to her people. But Ruth clings to 
Naomi and refuses to go. In the narrative, she says, “For where you go, I will go 
and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my 
God. Where you die, I will die; and there I will be buried. I will stand under the 
judgment of God if even death separates me from you.” 


It’s a moment in the story that taps into the human experience of grief and loss. 
It shows us the depth of loyalty and devotion and turns the plot in a direction of 
hope. Now, Naomi and Ruth journey together to Bethlehem. 


They reach the field of a man named Boaz, a relative of Naomi’s dead husband. 
Boaz is impressed with Ruth’s hard work and the way she cares for Naomi, and 
ultimately, he and she are married. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
60


The story has moved from loss to a new relationship. And the end has one final 
surprise. We learn that Ruth and Boaz had children and grandchildren and 
that their great-grandson was King David. David was the king who did the 
most to define Israel’s national identity; thus, it’s intriguing to think of Ruth—a 
foreigner—as his great-grandmother.

LECTURE 9
Saul, the Tragic King
 I 
n this lecture, we begin a consideration of the rule of the first three kings of 
Israel. Israel has moved from a rather loose confederation of 12 tribes into 
the struggle for a more unified national identity. Historically, we are in the 
decades just prior 1000 B.C. It’s a time of major political change. Up to this point, 
the people have relied on judges and warlords to maintain order and defend their 
territories against invasion. But now, they’ll be governed by kings, which marks the 
beginning of a new era. And the first king, our focus for this lecture, is Saul.
Act 1: End of an Era


We’ll read 1 Samuel as a drama in three acts: Act 1 recounts the end of the old 
era by focusing on a judge named Samuel. Act 2 marks the beginning of a new 
era, as Samuel identifies Saul as Israel’s first king and Saul rises to power. Finally, 
Act 3 traces the path of Saul’s tragic downfall.


In Act 1, God seems to be the primary shaper of events. The actions that occur 
carry out God’s purpose, which is to change a pattern of corruption among the 
clergy. 
●
●Having witnessed corruption at the sanctuary of the Ark of the Covenant, 
God determines to take action. He answers the prayer of a woman named 
Hannah, who has no children but desperately wants one, enabling her to 
bear a son called Samuel. 
●
●In gratitude, Hannah offers a prayer of celebration, which tells of God 
turning the social order upside down: He will destroy the weapons of the 
powerful, while giving help to the needy; he will bring down the rich and 
arrogant, while giving honor to the poor. This prayer foreshadows a time of 
dramatic social change.


This change is achieved through a battle, in which the people of Israel wrongly 
assume that God is on their side. Their adversaries are the Philistines. Because 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
62
the soldiers of Israel want God to support them, they take the Ark of the 
Covenant into battle. But in a stunning turn of events, God’s judgment unfolds 
by allowing Israel’s army to suffer defeat. In battle, the ark of is captured by the 
Philistines, and the corrupt priesthood at the sanctuary is brought to an end. 
Act 2: Saul’s Rise to Power


By the end of Act I, the old era has reached its end, and Samuel has begun to 
serve as a fair and honest judge for the people. But soon, Samuel’s sons fall 
into corruption, and it becomes clear that the old patterns will persist. Act II 
begins in chapter 8, where the people tell Samuel that they no longer want the 
old system of leadership by judges. They want a king in order to be like other 
nations. 


This request is an enormous misstep. It is a point of conflict between human 
desire and the purposes of God. The people assume that a king will give them 
prestige, status, and security, yet Samuel warns that kingship will bring the 
opposite—oppression, abuse of power, heavy taxation, and more. In the face 
of their insistent demand, however, Samuel discerns God’s response to let them 
have a king. Here, we can see the dimension of human responsibility emerging 
more clearly. The new phase begins when God gives in to human demand, and 
their misguided intentions set the course of events. 


In chapter 9, we are introduced to a young man named Saul, who seems to have 
considerable promise as a leader. Indeed, Samuel discerns that Saul is to be the 
new king over Israel. Samuel performs a symbolic action—anointing—that will 
enable Saul to rise to the heights of royal power. After Saul is anointed, he is 
filled with God’s Spirit, which empowers him for leadership. 


Saul then encounters his first major challenge as king. The crisis involves a town 
on the eastern side of the Jordan River that is under attack from a neighboring 
warlord. The people of the town send messengers to Saul, pleading for help. Saul 
responds with a show of strength that saves the city. His triumph establishes his 
reputation as a leader.

Lecture 9—Saul, the Tragic King 
63


Given this promising beginning, where do things go wrong? The narrative does 
not give us any simple answers. To some extent, it appears that Saul brings 
problems on himself. He makes decisions that, on one level, make good political 
and military sense, but on another level, reflect character flaws that will be his 
undoing. Yet there is also another dimension that involves Saul’s alienation 
from Samuel and, ultimately, from God. That will mean that Saul must struggle 
against God’s decision to replace him as king. 
●
●In chapter 15, Samuel tells Saul to go into battle against a troublesome desert 
tribe east of the Jordan River and to destroy all the people and livestock. 
●
●Initially, Saul is ready to engage in total war, but he objects that it would be a 
shame to let the enemy’s wealth go to waste. Even though Saul is not supposed 
to take any booty, he thinks that skimming off the best of the enemy’s property 
would be acceptable. To show their gratitude, Saul believes that the Israelites 
can offer a little something to God at one of the local sanctuaries. 
●
●In response, the writer of 1 Samuel says that God came to regret that he ever 
made Saul king. Although God was the one who chose Saul, Saul has now 
proven to be unreliable. God initially sends Samuel to confront Saul about 
the matter, but Saul merely tries to shift blame to the people. 
●
●Yet Saul’s attempt to evade responsibility brings things to the breaking point. 
Samuel declares that what God wants most is obedience to his word. Thus, 
Samuel gives Saul this haunting declaration: “Because you have rejected the 
word of God, God has rejected you from being king.” This loss of divine 
support means that Saul is reduced to being king in name only.
Act 3: Saul’s Downfall


The third act begins in chapter 16, where Saul’s loss of status is made clear by 
the selection of a new leader, who will eventually replace Saul. In Bethlehem, 
Samuel meets a shepherd named David whom he discerns to be the chosen king 
of Israel. Samuel anoints David to show that he will be the new leader, but the 
anointing is not made public. Saul knows nothing about it, and he unwittingly 
takes David into his service.


Saul becomes liable to deep brooding and melancholy, and to deal with it, he 
tries to find refuge in music. David is brought into the court as a musician, but 
his presence intensifies Saul’s moodiness when he becomes popular. A major 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
64
step in David’s rise and Saul’s downfall comes when David achieves renown 
by killing the giant Philistine named Goliath. Finally, Saul’s rage gets out of 
control; he throws a spear at David, who must run for his life. 
The Philistine 
Goliath dares the 
Israelites to send 
one of their best 
soldiers to take 
him on in single 
combat, but no 
one is willing—
until David says 
that he will fight 
and, of course, 
wins the seemingly 
impossible contest.

Lecture 9—Saul, the Tragic King 
65


David flees to the desert, where he becomes the leader of an outlaw band. 
From Saul’s perspective, David has become a kind of charismatic gang boss. 
Saul makes a desperate attempt to capture David, but he fails. Eventually, Saul 
must give up the chase, because the Philistines are on the march again and are 
threatening to bring down Saul’s kingdom. 


As we approach the end of the story, Saul is a failed king, who is running out 
of options. The Philistine armies are encircling his kingdom. As he faces the 
greatest battle of his career, Saul can see that his army has no chance. In the 
blackness of night, he makes a final plea for help from the spirit world. He 
makes his way to the home of a woman who claims to be able to consult the 
spirits of the dead.


Saul asks the woman to bring up the spirit of Samuel, who had died some 
years before. The woman says that she sees a figure who looks like an old man. 
Saul believes it to be Samuel’s ghost and pleads with the spirit of the dead man 
for help. Saul tells the spirit that God no longer answers him. But the spirit 
responds by saying that Saul has brought this on himself, because Saul is the one 
who turned away from God, and God is now letting Saul’s destructive decision 
take its course. The spirit warns that in battle the following day, the end will 
come. Saul and his sons will soon join Samuel in the realm of the dead. 


On the day of battle, the spirit’s words come true. The Philistine army 
overwhelms Saul, and Saul is mortally wounded. In an act of self-assertion, he 
commands his armor-bearer to kill him so that his enemies might not have the 
pleasure of doing so. But the armor-bearer refuses, and Saul falls on his own 
sword. Having set this course of self-destruction, Saul follows it out to the end. 
Interpreting 1 Samuel


One major approach to interpreting this tragedy is to see Saul as a negative moral 
example. We see how bad decisions lead to bad results, and we trace the way his 
early acts of decisive leadership became tainted by arrogance and jealousy. We 
must guard against the sins of pride and envy, because they inevitably lead to a 
person’s downfall. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
66


A second approach is to consider Saul as a tragic victim of circumstances. From 
this perspective, Saul had good intentions, but he made mistakes, and those 
mistakes set in motion a downward spiral of events that went far beyond his 
control. His unthinking actions led to tragic alienation from God, and once 
that course was set, Saul was trapped, with no way out. 


The book of 1 Samuel makes clear that Saul’s story ended badly. But it does not 
offer an easy explanation of why. It might be convenient simply to say that it was 
all Saul’s fault, yet such an answer is scarcely adequate when dealing with tragedy 
of this magnitude. Saul turned away from God unwittingly. Did he really deserve 
his terrible fate? And it might be equally convenient to say that it was all the will 
of God, as if the writer envisions God as some inexorable force of destiny, against 
which people can only struggle. But that answer, too, is inadequate. 


Saul’s choices seem to have played a significant role in his downfall. Instead of 
offering simple answers, this book draws us more deeply into the questions. 
Instead of resolving the tensions, the writer presses us to encounter them more 
deeply. Enabling us to do so may be this book’s most enduring legacy.

LECTURE 10
David and Nation Building
 I 
n this lecture, we turn to David, the successor to Israel’s first king, Saul. 
David’s reign is recounted in 2 Samuel. As we’ll see, David, more than anyone 
else, defined Israel’s identity as a nation. He won victories in war, brought 
unity to a divided people, and established a political dynasty that ruled for centuries. 
In many ways, belonging to the people of Israel meant identifying with the hope 
and promise that David represented. The challenge, of course, is that David became 
such a symbol of the nation that it can be difficult to get to know him as a person. 
To understand such figures with national significance, we need to look behind their 
iconic images. 
David’s Triumphs


As you recall, David was secretly anointed to be king while Saul, his predecessor, 
was still alive. Not long thereafter, Saul met his end in battle with the 
Philistines. Because there was no clear plan of succession, Saul’s death created 
a crisis of leadership that split the country in two. The northern part of the 
country thought that power should be transferred to Saul’s son. But people in 
the south thought power belonged to the most gifted leader, David, who was 
also a southerner. 


When the country split in half, the people of the north established their capital 
at a town called Mahanaim and referred to themselves as the people of Israel. 
At this point in the story, the name Israel refers specifically to the northern 
tribes. In contrast, the people of the south referred to themselves as the people 
of Judah. They located their capital at the city of Hebron, where David had his 
power base. 


The peoples of Israel and Judah engaged in a civil war for some time; the tipping 
point came through palace intrigues and assassination in the north. Saul’s son 
lost the confidence of his key supporters, and they killed him. His death again 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
68
created a power vacuum, convincing many in the north that the only real option 
was to give their support to David. Thus, the civil war ended when the people of 
the north came to David at Hebron and declared that they would recognize him 
as their king (2 Sam. 5) over a united country. 
David’s Challenge


David’s victory in the civil war created a new leadership challenge for him: It 
meant that he had the opportunity to lead the people into a different future, but 
the question was whether he would use that opportunity effectively or whether 
he would squander it. 


Early on, David sought to unify the country, to move it beyond the old divisions 
created by civil war. A major step here was to create a new capital city, for which 
he chose Jerusalem. The city was located on the dividing line between north and 
south. David’s troops succeeded in capturing Jerusalem from the Jebusites, and 
it became the new political center for the country.


Because David also wanted Jerusalem to become the religious center for the 
nation, he decided to bring the Ark of the Covenant there. He staged a grand 
procession to bring the ark to his capital city and placed it in a tent. 


On the one hand, we might read David’s success in giving Jerusalem both 
political and religious significance as an account of his devotion to God. After 
all, David offered prayers and sacrifices when he brought the ark to Jerusalem. 
We might discern in these actions the recognition that he, as king, is still subject 
to a higher authority, and that recognition would create an implicit limit in the 
use of political power. It would mean that David, as king, along with his people, 
were finally accountable to a God, whose authority was higher than theirs. 


On the other hand, we might also read this as an account of David making 
use of religious rituals to serve his own political ends. He had already made 
Jerusalem into his new political capital. Thus, we might see the return of the 
ark as an effort to give religious support to his new central government. Instead 
of seeing David honoring the higher authority of God, we might see it as the 

Lecture 10—David and Nation Building 
69
opposite. We might interpret this as David’s attempt to use the authority of 
God to support his own royal agenda. 
David as Founder of a Dynasty


At the beginning of 2 Samuel 7, David is comfortably settled into his house 
or palace in Jerusalem. He assumes that if he, as king, has a house, then God 
should have a house, too; specifically, he thinks that the Ark of the Covenant 
should have a permanent house or temple, rather than a tent. He relays this idea 
to a prophet named Nathan. 


Nathan tells David that God is quite satisfied with the traditional practice of 
placing the Ark of the Covenant in a tent and sees no need to change that 
arrangement. Instead, God sees himself as the builder—the builder of a house 
or dynasty for David. God promises that David’s descendants will inherit his 
throne. And through that Davidic dynasty, God will establish a kingdom that 
The Ark of the Covenant was the 
great sign of God’s presence among 
the people, and David believed that 
its presence in the city would make 
Jerusalem the focus of religious life.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
70
will endure forever. Once God has built a house or dynasty for David, one of 
David’s sons can build a house or temple for God. 


In that same passage, Nathan compares God’s relationship to the king to that of 
a father and his son. In ancient Israel, people believed that God adopted each 
king as his son, but that did not mean that the king was exempt from criticism. 
Nathan explains that just as an earthly father would discipline his son whenever 
the child did something wrong, God will discipline the king. Yet just as earthly 
father would remain committed to his son—even a disobedient son—God will 
remain committed to David and his heirs forever.


As we continue reading 2 Samuel, we find that despite the promise of God’s 
support, David is deeply flawed. He is capable of infidelity and brutality and 
must come to terms with the consequences of his own personal failings. 
●
●In 2 Samuel 11, David is at home in his palace in Jerusalem while his army 
is fighting many miles away. One day, David catches a glimpse of a beautiful 
woman, Bathsheba, bathing in a house nearby. Her husband is away on active 
military duty. David has Bathsheba brought to his room, where he sleeps 
with her. Sometime later, Bathsheba lets David know that she is pregnant.
●
●David thinks he can cover up the affair by bringing Bathsheba’s husband back 
from military duty for a short home visit. But the husband refuses to sleep 
with Bathsheba while all his men are camped in the field. Then, David sends 
Bathsheba’s husband on a suicide mission and takes Bathsheba as his own wife.
●
●The prophet Nathan is appalled by David’s machinations. Nathan had told 
David that God wants to build him a dynasty and that God will establish 
David’s kingdom forever. Nathan confronts David by telling a parable (2 
Sam. 12), in which a rich man unjustly slaughters the lamb of a poor man. 
●
●Outraged at the injustice in the parable, David condemns what the rich 
man has done and declares that the rich man must repay the poor man four 
times the amount taken. Already, we can see the parable doing its work. 
Nathan did not have to tell David that what the rich man did was unjust. 
The story moved David himself to see the injustice. This allows Nathan to 
turn David’s judgment against the rich man in the story into a judgment 
against David’s own actions. 
●
●To make sure that David does not miss the point, Nathan tells him that if it 
is wrong for a rich man to take a poor man’s lamb, then it is far worse for the 

Lecture 10—David and Nation Building 
71
king to seize another man’s wife. And it is unconscionable to have the man 
killed in order to cover up the affair. This audacious confrontation of the 
king works. David acknowledges his wrongdoing. That is perhaps the one 
admirable trait David displays in this whole sordid affair: He proves capable 
of taking ownership for what he has done. 
●
●Nathan forgives David, but forgiveness does not mean that David’s actions 
have no consequences. Nathan warns that David has set in motion a pattern 
of violence that will continue into the next generation. To be sure, David 
repents of what he has done, but he cannot control what his children will do. 
And the last part of 2 Samuel tells of the violent pattern that David has set in 
motion being followed by one of his sons, Absalom. 
The Story of Absalom


In 2 Samuel 15, we learn that Absalom, like David, has both ambition and 
ability and is brilliant at currying favor with the public. Eventually, Absalom 
has enough support to launch his bid for kingship, which he does in the city of 
Hebron, just as David had done years before. And just as David then captured 
Jerusalem to make it his capital, Absalom sets out to capture Jerusalem. He 
succeeds and sets out after David, in what promises to be a decisive battle. 


Underneath this political and military maneuvering, the personal side of the story 
moves toward a heartbreaking conclusion. Although Absalom has rebelled, David 
still loves him. Thus, as the time for battle approaches, David tells his men, “Deal 
gently with the young man Absalom.” But that does not prove to be easy during 
the chaos of war, and Absalom is killed. A messenger brings the news to David. 


At the end of chapter 18, when David gets the news of Absalom’s death, he 
is deeply moved. In grief, he weeps: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son, 
Absalom. Would that I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son.” 
David’s words express the willingness of a parent to sacrifice his or her own life 
for the sake of a child. The scene captures the heartrending sorrow of someone 
whose child has set out on a destructive path, from which not even the most 
devoted love can save him. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
72


It may also be that David weeps not only for Absalom but also for himself. After 
all, his son is simply following in his father’s footsteps. David’s life set a pattern in 
motion, a pattern of violence and abuse that continued to play out in the life of 
Absalom. In the affair with Bathsheba and its aftermath, David ruined the lives of 
others to satisfy his own desires. David grieves not only as someone who has lost a 
child but as someone whose own moral failings set the pattern that led to the loss.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The lecture began by noting David’s role as a national symbol. What parts of 
his legacy contributed most to that role, and why? 
2.	 The idea that David was chosen by God to be the founder of a dynasty 
plays a central role in 2 Samuel, and it is often mentioned in other parts 
of the Bible. Why, then, would 2 Samuel also tell readers about David’s 
moral failings and family conflicts? Do those aspects help or hurt the overall 
portrayal of David’s importance?

LECTURE 11
Solomon, a Study in 
Contradictions
 A 
fter the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David, came Solomon, who is 
remembered for his legendary wisdom and wealth. The writer of 1 Kings 
tells us of Solomon’s learning, his interest in arts, and his monumental 
building projects. But the writer is quite aware that Solomon’s reign is a study in 
contradictions. In this lecture, we’ll explore those contradictions and ask why such 
a story might continue to engage our imaginations. How can the same story present 
both wisdom and ruthless ambition, splendor and oppression, and religious devotion 
mixed with infidelity? In the end, we will see Solomon’s son making a fateful decision 
about which side of his father’s legacy he would claim and carry forward.
Ambition versus Wisdom


The opening chapters of 1 Kings juxtapose Solomon’s wisdom with ruthless 
ambition—and ambition takes the lead in the story. As the story begins, 
King David is old and feeble, and his incapacity has created a power vacuum. 
Members of his court are beginning to position themselves to assume the 
kingship after David’s death. 


In competition are David’s eldest living son, Adonijah, and Solomon, the son 
of David and Bathsheba. Both put together coalitions of influential supporters 
and plan rival coronation ceremonies. Ultimately, Solomon wins out, and he 
promises that if Adonijah proves to be no threat, he will be allowed to live. But 
if Solomon suspects Adonijah of disloyalty, he will kill him, which is, of course, 
what happens.
●
●After David’s death, Adonijah asked if he could marry the young woman who 
had been David’s nurse. Solomon saw this as a political move that might give 
Adonijah prestige in the public eye. Thus, Solomon immediately ordered that 
Adonijah be assassinated. He also ordered the assassination of the military 
commander and the arrest of the priest who had supported Adonijah. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
74
●
●At the end of chapter 2, there is a sentence that is so simple we might miss 
its meaning: “So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.” 
In other words, it was established through palace intrigue, multiple 
assassinations, and arrest. 


At this juncture in the story, two different portraits of Solomon collide. 
Everything we’ve seen so far gives us a portrait of someone who gained political 
power through ruthless ambition and retains power through violence. It’s a 
pattern that has been played out countless times in history. But now, in chapter 
3, we find a different portrait of Solomon. Here, he is depicted as a thoughtful 
king who asks God for the wisdom needed to govern his people rightly. 
●
●Solomon has a dream, and in the dream God says, “Ask what I should give 
you.” Solomon responds with gratitude for the steadfast love that God 
showed to his father, David. He speaks about the challenges of governing and 
asks God to give him an understanding mind. Solomon prays for the wisdom 
to distinguish good from evil in order that he might govern the people well. 
●
●Solomon’s request for wisdom pleases God, and in the dream, God promises 
to grant the request. What’s more, God will add long life and great wealth to 
Solomon’s legacy. This is the chapter that paints a portrait of Solomon as the 
wise king, who will bring about a cultural renaissance in Israel and establish 
a monarchy with extraordinary wealth. 


The scene that follows illustrates Solomon’s wisdom and insight into human 
nature. It is the famous story of Solomon offering to cut a child in half to settle 
a dispute between two women about who is the child’s mother. Of course, the 
woman who protests must be the child’s true parent. The idea in this scene is 
that through his wisdom, Solomon sees that justice is done.


By this point in the story, we have two rather different perspectives at play. In 
some places, we see the ruthless Solomon, who will stop at nothing in his effort 
to secure the kingship for himself. And in other places, we see the wise Solomon, 
whose greatest desire is governing his people rightly. The writer presses us to see 
both aspects, and as he does so, he implicitly raises questions about the nature 
of leadership. What might come from the ruthless acquisition of power? What 
difference might it make to follow the path of wisdom?

Lecture 11—Solomon, a Study in Contradictions 
75
Splendor versus Oppression


The writer of 1 Kings shows us yet another dimension of the story when he 
contrasts the splendor of Solomon’s kingdom with his oppression of the people. 
The writer tells us of Solomon’s impressive achievements, while pointing to 
the brutality that made those achievements possible. On the impressive side of 
the equation, Solomon creates a vast administrative structure for his kingdom, 
expands his military capacity and international trade, and fortifies cities. In 
Jerusalem, Solomon spends years building an exquisite palace for himself and 
a temple for God. 


Yet the writer of 1 Kings also repeatedly tells us that Solomon had to oppress 
people to achieve what he did. We find this theme in chapter 5, where Solomon 
orders expensive building materials, which must be paid for by heavy taxation 
on his people, and uses forced labor. 


Throughout the story of Solomon, splendor and oppression go hand in hand. 
For each impressive building project, there are the people who are forced to 
do the work. Again, the writer of 1 Kings raises the implicit question: What 
will come of all this? Can readers say that the impressive results are worth the 
price in human suffering? Or will they find that such harsh methods finally 
undermine Solomon’s effort to achieve greatness?
Devotion versus Infidelity


The third aspect of the story is its religious dimension. In religious terms, 
Solomon’s reign involves both devotion and infidelity. For much of the story, it 
is Solomon’s devotion to God that seems primary. After all, his most significant 
project was building the temple for God in Jerusalem—the temple that would 
be the central religious institution of Israel for centuries. 


The writer of 1 Kings gives us an extensive description of the temple, including 
the central building, the bronze basin in front of it, an altar for animal sacrifices, 
and the interior rooms. The festival at which Solomon dedicated the new temple 
is described in 1 Kings 8. It is a scene filled with religious pageantry, in which 
the priests stage a procession to bring the Ark of the Covenant to the temple for 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
76
The splendor of Solomon’s court 
is celebrated in a famous scene in 
which the Queen of Sheba visits 
and says that king’s court surpasses 
everything she has heard about it.

Lecture 11—Solomon, a Study in Contradictions 
77
the first time. The writer tells of Solomon offering countless sheep and oxen as 
sacrifices. Then, a cloud—signifying divine glory—fills the temple. 


At this point, Solomon offers a prayer that defines the significance of the 
temple. We learn that the temple is where God is uniquely present. The prayer 
says that God’s dwelling place is actually in heaven, which means that God can’t 
be confined to any one place on earth. Instead, the temple is the place where 
God has made his “name” to dwell. 
●
●The emphasis on the name shows that God has a particular identity, and it’s 
an identity that is revealed through what he does for people. If someone asks 
which God is worshipped in the temple, the response is that it’s the God 
who delivered Israel out of slavery. It’s the God who made a covenant with 
them and shows steadfast love to them. 
●
●Those commitments give God his identity. Thus, when people come to the 
temple for worship, it’s a tangible way of turning toward the God whose 
identity has been made known in this way. 


Solomon’s prayer depicts the temple as a visible sign of God’s willingness to 
listen to people who need help. The prayer tells of people who are victims of 
wrongdoing, who suffer from hunger and illness. Solomon recognizes that such 
people may come from Israel or from other nations. And in every case, Solomon 
asks that as they turn toward the temple, the God who dwells in heaven might 
hear them and act graciously to them. The temple is to be a focus for prayer—
for Israel and for people everywhere. 


If the main theme of Solomon’s prayer is that God should faithfully listen to 
people, then the conclusion of the prayer brings that idea full circle. If God 
listens to people, then people should also listen to God. They should heed his 
commandments and lead lives of integrity and compassion, as God desires. In 
the context of 1 Kings, that seems logical enough. But here, the writer shows us 
a third contradiction in Solomon: that between his public devotion to God and 
his readiness to support the worship of other gods when that seems convenient. 
●
●Through making political marriage alliances with neighboring countries, 
Solomon has accumulated 700 wives and 300 concubines. To keep all his 
wives happy, Solomon builds sanctuaries to the various gods they worship. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
78
●
●Although Solomon’s words may call for devotion to God, his actions 
contradict that. His public prayer expresses lofty ideals, but his personal 
life turns religious commitment into doing whatever is needed to placate 
members of his household. 
A Legacy of Contradictions


As Solomon’s life draws to a close, he leaves a legacy of contradictions. And this 
leads us to a haunting question: How will the next generation deal with the 
contradictions it inherits?


In chapter 12, the writer of 1 Kings takes us to a critical moment when 
Solomon’s son Rehoboam must determine the wisest course of action as he 
begins to rule. The people come to Rehoboam and plead with him, asking that 
he ease up on the use of forced labor and heavy taxation. 


The older members of the court think the wisest course of action is to become 
a leader who serves the people well. From their perspective, wisdom means 
that a leader governs graciously and fairly. When we think back to the story 
of Solomon, that is the kind of wisdom he once prayed for. But the younger 
members of the court say the opposite; they think wisdom calls for forcefulness. 
In their eyes, Solomon achieved greatness by subjugating the people, not by 
serving them. 


Solomon’s son chooses to continue the brutal side of his father’s legacy. He 
identifies leadership with subjugation rather than service. And it shatters the 
country. In 922 B.C., the people in the northern half of the country reject the 
harsh policies of Rehoboam and break away to form their own kingdom. They 
also establish their own sanctuaries. And as in the time before David reunited 
the nation, the people of the north call themselves Israel. Only the people of the 
south remain loyal to Solomon’s son and continue to worship in the temple in 
Jerusalem; as in the past, they call themselves Judah.

LECTURE 12
Psalms: The Bible’s Songbook
 T 
he book of Psalms includes 150 songs, poems, and prayers, each of 
which represents the power of music to express our different experiences, 
feelings, and moods. In this lecture, we’ll consider four types of psalms 
that appear in various forms throughout the book. First are the songs of praise, 
which have a joyful tone. Second are the prayers for help, which express grief and 
the need for hope. Third are psalms of gratitude, which give thanks for something 
good that has happened. And fourth are psalms that express trust.
Psalm 150


Psalm 150 is a wonderful example of a psalm of praise. The first line and last 
lines of this psalm are identical: “Praise the Lord!” And that simple expression of 
praise at the beginning and end frames everything in between. 


Indeed, the lyrics of this psalm have a repetitive quality, with one line saying 
something similar to the proceeding one. The pattern is called parallelism, and it 
characterizes Hebrew poetry. The first verse of Psalm 150 makes two statements 
about where God should be praised. First, it says, “Praise God in his sanctuary”; 
then, it adds, “Praise him in his mighty heavens.” 
●
●The repetition of these two statements about place creates a sense of 
movement. The psalm initially places readers in the sanctuary or temple, 
where the community gathers for worship. The festive tone shows that the 
worshippers have come to express joy through music. 
●
●Then the psalm directs attention upward, toward the heavens. It doesn’t 
allow worshippers to confine praise within the walls of a building but points 
to the vastness of heaven, which is also the place of God’s presence. 


Next, the psalm tells us why praise should be given, again, in parallel lines. 
The text says, “Praise him for his mighty deeds. Praise him according to his 
surpassing greatness.” In other words, give praise because of God’s action and 

Lecture 12—Psalms: The Bible’s Songbook 
81
his character. We’re not told which of God’s mighty deeds the writer has in 
mind, but as readers, we must use our imagination to fill out the picture. 
Psalm 148


In psalms of praise, the feeling is one of joy, yet it’s hard to tell people to feel 
joy and simply expect it to happen. Joy is deeply connected to the experience of 
something good. And psalms of praise are most meaningful when they tap into 
an experience that the readers themselves have had. For example, Psalm 148 
evokes the sense of wonder that people experience when they’re surrounded by 
the natural world.


The first word in Psalm 148 is again “Hallelujah,” or “Praise the Lord.” The 
next line draws our imagination toward the sky, in the same repetitive style 
we’ve seen before. It reads, “Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the 
heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him all his host!” 


Then, in rapid succession, the sun, moon, and stars come into view, and the 
psalm then speaks as if the heavenly bodies actually join in the chorus of praise. 
It reads, “Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.” The 
language is poetic, of course, but it suggests that the heavenly bodies not only 
evoke wonder in human beings, but they also praise God by their shining. 


Eventually, human beings get into the act as kings and commoners, men and 
women, young and old add their praises to the song. Notice that people are not 
set apart from the natural world but are within it. The praise they offer to God 
is part of a much larger chorus that includes the whispering of the wind, the 
falling of the rain, and the mysterious sounds of creatures everywhere.
Psalm 13


Psalms that are prayers for help are sometimes called laments. Instead of 
expressing joy, they convey grief, bringing the experience of human anguish to 
expression before God. Psalm 13 is a good example. The psalm has only six 
verses, but it takes us on an emotional journey. The first two verses consist of 
anguished, unanswered questions. The middle two verses plead for help. And 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
82
the last two offer a sense of hope that will enable the writer to live on, despite 
the pain of the present moment. 


The first two verses of the psalm ask, “How long, O Lord? Will you forget 
me forever?” We might imagine these words being uttered in a tone of quiet 
desperation. But the words can also convey an emotional intensity that borders 
on anger. In the opening line, the psalm speaks of being forgotten by God, as 
if God is distracted and failing to pay attention. But the next line goes further, 
and asks, “How long will you hide your face from me?” It seems as if God is not 
merely distracted but has intentionally and inexplicably turned away. 


The psalm expresses what this abandonment feels like by asking, “How long 
must I wrestle with my thoughts and have sorrow in my heart all day long? 
How long will my enemy triumph over me?” Significantly, these questions are 
not answered. The lament psalms recognize that in situations of grief and loss, 
people often need to express what they feel without any attempt to suppress it. 
Psalm 13 gives voice to painful questions that resist simplistic answers. 


The language here is evocative. The writer refers to some unnamed “enemy” 
that’s getting the best of him, but that enemy is left undefined. When we turn 
to the middle two verses, which plead for help, we sometimes get the impression 
that the writer is dealing with human opponents, yet the enemy might also be 
some kind of illness. In these same verses, the writer pleads for help because he’s 
falling into the sleep of death. 


This evocative quality contributes to the psalm’s value for many readers. It 
allows them to relate the psalm to various experiences in their own lives. What’s 
more, the psalm empowers them to talk back to God. Where the opening verses 
picture God hiding his face from the situation, the middle verses tell God, 
“Look at me!” Where the opening verses ask pointed questions that are left 
unresolved, the middle verses say, “Answer me!” 


In musical terms, everything in the psalm thus far has been disturbing and 
dissonant. But as we come to the last two verses, the music shifts from the 
minor key to a major one. A ray of light enters the darkness, as despair turns 
toward hope. The writer has not found answers to his questions, but he needs 

Lecture 12—Psalms: The Bible’s Songbook 
83
to live in the face of those questions. And what enables him to do that is that he 
trusts God’s steadfast love. 
Psalm 32


Most psalms that give thanks have a basic pattern: They begin with an 
expression of gratitude. Then, in in the middle, the writer looks back to the 
difficult situation in which help was received. At the end, the writer invites 
others to join in giving thanks. 


In Psalm 32, we find a writer who has caused his own problems. He is 
responsible for something that has gone terribly wrong and must come to terms 
with the fact that he’s done something that he deeply regrets. What’s notable 
about this psalm is the way it probes the depths of that experience. 


The opening lines are written in the repetitive style we saw earlier: “Blessed is the 
one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.” Then, “Blessed is the 
one against whom the Lord counts no iniquity, and in whose spirit is no deceit.” 
The Hebrew word for “blessed” here expresses a sense of well-being and wholeness. 


The next passage challenges any simplistic reading. The text at first gives give 
the impression that people are either righteous or wicked, but then those simple 
alternatives are broken down. The writer may want to think of himself as a 
good person, but he’s been in the wrong, and as we move to the middle of the 
psalm, he must come to terms with this. The psalm recognizes that all people, 
including religious people, are fallible, and the process of dealing with one’s own 
failings is a deeply human enterprise. 


The writer knows that the most natural response to having done something 
hurtful is to cover it up, but that creates an internal dissonance between the 
person the writer wants to be and the person he really is. The psalm describes 
this internal struggle vividly: “When I kept silence, my body wasted away 
through my groaning all day long.” 


The turning point comes when the writer breaks the silence and takes 
responsibility for what has happened. He turns outward, moving from his 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
84
internal brooding to speak directly to God, and he finds that telling the truth 
is a major step toward healing. The process is completed through forgiveness, 
which brings a restoration of relationship. 
Psalm 23


Psalm 23, which begins, “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want,” is one of 
the most well-known passages in the Bible. The hallmark of this psalm is its use of 
extended metaphor, depicting God’s relationship to people as that of a shepherd 
to his sheep. The evocative quality of this image allows the psalm to be connected 
to human experience in various ways, contributing to its broad appeal.


The psalm takes up the theme of life’s vulnerability. There is no sense of crisis 
here, as we’ve seen in some other psalms. But there is a sense that life can be 
uncertain, so that help and support are needed each day. 
Contrary to some of the 
inscriptions on the individual 
poems, the collection of psalms 
grew over time and explores 
themes of perennial interest.

Lecture 12—Psalms: The Bible’s Songbook 
85


The sense of vulnerability is heightened in verse 4, which says, “Even though 
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you 
are with me. Your rod and your staff they comfort me.” People hear this vivid 
imagery as offering assurance of God’s presence. Even as life slips away, people 
are not left alone. 


In the final verses of the psalm, the imagery changes. God is no longer a shepherd 
but the host at a banquet. And people are no longer sheep but guests. The psalm 
says, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint 
my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me 
all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” 


As the imagery changes, the sense of vulnerability persists because there are still 
unnamed “enemies” in view. Yet the sense of protection and care also persists 
and even grows. God not only provides the basics but offers a life so abundant 
that it seems like a banquet. And if enemies treat a person with contempt, God 
offers a place of honor and dignity.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The psalms were written in a cultural context that differs from those of 
modern readers. In what ways do the ancient poetic images seem strange and 
difficult to interpret? In what ways do they remain accessible and engaging?
2.	 The lecture noted points at which the psalms use evocative imagery that can 
be connected to human experience in various ways. What possibilities does 
that present for interpretation? What problems might arise in the process?

n this lecture, we’ll explore what are known as the Bible’s wisdom books: 
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job. These books create a kind of dialogue or 
even a debate over the meaning of life. Proverbs takes a practical approach, 
assuming that the world makes sense and that if you follow good advice, you can 
have a successful and rewarding life. But Ecclesiastes presses the question. You can 
work hard and succeed, but then you die. Job goes even further by insisting that 
life isn’t just meaningless but unfair. You can do all the right things, but disease and 
disaster can take it all away. These three books leave us with intriguing questions: 
Can life be meaningful? And if so, how?
Proverbs


Proverbs is a collection of material that was put together over many centuries 
from sources in different cultures. The first nine chapters of the book are a 
poetic introduction to the collections of wise sayings that follow. 


The basic perspective is introduced in Proverbs 1:7, which says, “The fear of 
the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.” Proverbs assumes that the quest for 
knowledge is, at heart, a religious exercise. People honor God by exercising their 
minds in all fields of study. The world is God’s handiwork, and all attempts 
to understand it probe the mysteries of what God has done. Proverbs has no 
patience for the idea that reverence for God puts an end to critical thought. 


The poetic introduction emphasizes that actions have consequences—just the 
kind of lesson parents want their children to learn. Thus, Proverbs begins with 
advice to listen to one’s father and mother and not to get in with the wrong 
circle of friends. We hear a parental tone in what follows and see that beneath all 
the admonitions is a genuine concern for the child’s welfare.


The positive alternative is to listen to wisdom, who is often personified as a 
woman in the opening chapters. Especially memorable is Proverbs 8, where 
wisdom promises to teach the kind of good judgment that leads to a good life. 
The poem goes on to say that wisdom was present with God when the world 
itself was created. 


In chapter 10, the collections of proverbs begin, and they provide the basic 
curriculum for a “school of life.” They’re practical and distill complex forms 
of experience into single sentences. They give us a basic orientation toward a 
situation, while assuming that we will need to work out the details as we go. For 
example, Proverbs 10:4 says, “A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the 
diligent makes rich.” 


Some of the proverbs warn about the problem of arrogance. Proverbs 16:18 
reads, “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.” 
Interestingly, alongside the proverbs that promote a successful life are some that 
remind us that money isn’t everything. Proverbs 17 begins, “Better is a dry crust 
of bread where there is quiet, than a house full of feasting with strife.”
The female figure of wisdom is with 
God at the time he created the first 
human being, giving shape to the 
existing order of things.

Ecclesiastes


Throughout Proverbs, we have the sense that people can take steps that will lead 
to a better and more satisfying life. But our second book, Ecclesiastes, challenges 
that approach. The writer of Ecclesiastes is a person who has been successful and 
achieved a good life yet finds it meaningless. The book is a stark and disturbing 
reflection on the emptiness of success. 


Ecclesiastes 1:2 states the theme: “Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, all is 
vanity.” That word vanity is the traditional translation, but it is actually better 
to translate that key word as “pointless” or “meaningless.” The Hebrew word is 
hebel, which refers to vapor or breath. Life is like a puff of smoke that the wind 
blows away into nothingness. 


The book of Proverbs tells us to work hard to get ahead, but Ecclesiastes asks, 
“What do people gain from all the toil at which they toil under the sun?” The 
writer says that each generation is born, then dies and is forgotten. Verse 14 
reads, “I’ve looked at everything that’s done under the sun, and I can see it’s all 
pointless. It’s chasing after wind.” 


In chapter 2, the author recalls that he spent his life doing the things he liked. He 
built houses and planted vineyards; he had livestock and gold. But in the end, he 
found that all his success was pointless because nothing lasts. All our striving adds 
up to nothing but a castle made of sand that is washed away by time.


If everything is transient, and no successes have ultimate meaning, then how do 
we face life each day? Ecclesiastes responds with two points. 
●
●One is an attitude of acceptance that we belong to the ongoing cycle of life 
and death. This is reflected in the most famous part of the book (Eccles. 3): 
“To everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven.” 
The writer describes the endless cycle of life that God has created. God’s work 
will endure; ours will not. And accepting our own transience is essential. 
●
●The second point is that even if we can’t find ultimate meaning in things, we 
can have moments of satisfaction. Ecclesiastes 5:18 says, “It is fitting to eat 
and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the 
sun, in the few days God gives us, for this is our lot.” This theme of finding 

Lecture 13—Biblical Wisdom Literature 
89
enjoyment in the moment appears at key points throughout the book, and 
the writer considers those moments to be genuine gifts from God. 


But interpreters of Ecclesiastes wonder where that leaves us. There are some who 
think the idea of finding joy in the moment is genuinely hopeful. They emphasize 
that finding satisfaction in the ordinary things of life really is a gift of God, and 
it makes life meaningful. But others see this as a kind of resignation. If you can 
enjoy things for a moment, that’s good, because life has nothing more to offer. 
Job


As we saw, the book of Proverbs teaches us that actions have consequences, 
which seems to mean that people who suffer must have done something wrong. 
But the book of Job challenges that line of thinking in ways that make it one of 
the most provocative books in the Bible. 


The opening scene of Job describes a world in which things make sense. 
We learn that Job is a good and deeply religious man, who has a good and 
prosperous life. But then, his world comes crashing down as Satan convinces 
God that he should test Job’s character. Satan insists that if Job lost his family, 
wealth, or health, he would curse God to his face. 


God allows Satan to test Job with a series of tragic events. Job loses his livestock, 
his servants, his children, and his health. His wife tells him that he might as 
well curse God and die, because at least that would end his suffering. But Job 
continues to bear up and does not curse God. 


At this point, three of Job’s friends show up, and for seven days, they sit with 
Job in silence because his suffering is so great. Finally, the debates begin as Job’s 
friends try to make sense of what has happened. 
●
●The three friends operate with a worldview in which actions have 
consequences and God is just and fair. To make Job’s suffering fit into that 
worldview, they argue that he must have done something to deserve it. 
●
●But Job’s worldview centers on his experience of tragedy. He sees no 
correlation between actions and consequences. A person can do what is right 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
90
and still suffer. He cannot see that God is fair and just. His suffering makes 
no sense at all. 
●
●The dialogues between Job and his friends go on, with point and 
counterpoint. When Job’s friends insist that suffering comes to those who 
do wrong, Job says that he sees wicked people thriving and good people 
suffering. Job is speaking now as a religious rebel, who challenges God to 
meet him in court, so he can finally have a fair trial and vindicate himself. 
The book of Job takes up the 
problem of human suffering 
in ways that fit within Israel’s 
tradition but also go beyond it; the 
question was significant for people 
throughout the ancient world, as it 
continues to be for people today.

Lecture 13—Biblical Wisdom Literature 
91
●
●When the three friends run out of arguments, a fourth friend named Elihu 
takes up their cause. He argues that Job may claim to be innocent, but no 
one can really claim to be innocent before God. Job claims that God is not 
fair, but Elihu insists that God is fair. If God sends suffering, the goal is that 
people repent and return to the ways of God. 


It’s at this point that God finally breaks his silence. In Job 38–41, God speaks 
to Job out of the whirlwind, but he gives no answers or explanations. Instead, 
God replies to Job’s questions with more questions, and he introduces a third 
perspective: Rather than trying to explain suffering, God reframes the issue and 
places it in a larger context. 
●
●Initially, God’s questions seem to have nothing to do with Job’s suffering 
at all. Instead, they draw Job out of a worldview that is defined by his own 
experience of loss and place him in the context of a world so vast that it 
defies his understanding. 
●
●God asks where Job was when the world was created, whether he understands 
the secrets of the sea or comprehends the origins of snow and rain. The point 
is that even as Job rails against God, the ocean waves continue to wash 
against shore, and dawn comes each morning. While Job denounces God’s 
unfairness, God ensures that life goes on.


At the center of Job’s worldview is his experience of loss. But God describes 
a world in which human beings are not the defining element. These chapters 
give attention to all the wild creatures that God has made, none of which is 
particularly useful to human beings, yet God provides for them all. And Job 
himself belongs to that world. Strangely, he wouldn’t be able to rage at God’s 
unfairness unless God had given him the breath to do so. 


In the final chapter of the book, God blesses Job and restores his fortunes. But 
not even there do we find a satisfying explanation for all the suffering that Job 
endured. At some level, it remains incomprehensible—and that’s essential to 
the story. When something tragic happens, people want an explanation. But the 
debates in the book of Job show that some situations defy all attempts at easy 
explanation. Instead of giving answers, the book enables people to live with the 
questions.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Ecclesiastes juxtaposes observations about the futility of life with the 
possibility of finding enjoyment in one’s work. Do you discern genuine 
hope in this book, or is the message essentially one of resignation? What 
distinguishes those two attitudes? 
2.	 The book of Job challenges common attempts to find explanations for 
suffering. The book shows how life goes on even as the questions remain 
unanswered. How is that approach helpful? What are its limitations?

LECTURE 14
Elijah, the Troubler of Israel 
 I 
n this lecture, we begin an exploration of the prophets of the Old Testament, 
starting with Elijah. As we follow Elijah’s story, we will first see him defy the 
powers that be, then flee to the margins, where he hangs on by a thread. 
Next, he comes back to challenge the claims made about the god Baal, which the 
reigning king and queen of Israel used to support their regime. In the middle, 
Elijah faces a different kind of drama, when he must contend with his own sense of 
isolation and despair. Finally, he returns to challenge the abuse of power by the royal 
house before a whirlwind carries him off to an unseen realm above.
Elijah on the Margins


At the end of 1 Kings 16, we learn that city of Samaria in the northern kingdom 
of Israel had become the capital, under the rule of a king named Ahab. Ahab 
had married a woman named Jezebel, who came from the city of Sidon. She 
and Ahab promoted the worship of the god Baal and the goddess Asherah, and 
this worship was seen as giving support to their regime. But in the eyes of such 
people as Elijah, the establishment of the cult of Baal was a betrayal of the faith 
that gave Israel its identity. It sparked conflict over the question of religious 
truth and the legitimacy of the government itself. 


The conflict came to a head over the issue of rainfall, of which Baal was the 
god. People believed that during the wet season of the year, Baal replenished the 
earth with the rain. In 1 Kings 17, Elijah issues a direct challenge to this idea. 
He speaks for the God of Israel and announces that the annual cycle of rain and 
dryness will stop, and there will be drought for several years. If people think Baal 
can make it rain on schedule, then Elijah will show them this is not the case. 


Elijah understands that his act of defiance puts him in opposition to the ruling 
power. Thus, he slips away to the region east of the Jordan River, just beyond 
the reach of Ahab and Jezebel. Later, he goes to the village of Zarephath, which 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
94
is in the north. This move is audacious, because that village is near Sidon, the 
hometown of Queen Jezebel. 
●
●In Zarephath, Elijah meets an impoverished widow. This woman is gathering 
a few sticks to make a fire. All she has left is little flour and oil, with which 
she plans to make one last loaf of bread. After she and her son eat the bread, 
they’ll starve. 
●
●In response to this situation, Elijah makes an outrageous request. He tells 
her to share her bread with him because the God of Israel will replenish her 
flour and oil. The widow feeds the prophet, and she, in turn, is fed because 
the flour and oil don’t run out. 


Soon, however, the widow’s son becomes ill and stops breathing. The woman 
assumes that Elijah must have told God about some secret sin of hers and that 
God is now punishing her by killing her boy. But the prophet carries the boy to 
an upper room and prays that God will restore his life. The child revives, and 
the prophet gives him back to his mother. 


This story is told with a profound sense of irony. It pictures those who rule 
Israel investing everything in the cult of Baal, yet outside of Israel, in the region 
that was supposed to belong to Baal, the God of Israel is at work, giving life 
to a widow and her son. The ironic turn is subversive, because the widow, the 
outsider, proves to be more faithful than the insiders, who rule in Samaria.
Elijah at the Center


In the second phase of Elijah’s story, the action shifts from the margin of society 
to the center. In 1 Kings 18, Elijah challenges King Ahab to a contest. He wants 
all the prophets of Baal and Asherah to meet him on Mount Carmel. There, 
they will determine whose god can rightfully claim the allegiance of the people.


Here again, Elijah is outrageous. The story pictures 450 prophets of Baal against 
one lone prophet of God. The contest is a challenge to Baal to send lightning 
from the sky to ignite a sacrifice. Elijah will ask God to do the same. Whoever 
answers by fire can truly claim to be God. 

Lecture 14—Elijah, the Troubler of Israel  
95


The prophets of Baal call out and do a ritual dance around the altar, but there 
is no fire from heaven. As the hours pass, Elijah taunts them. His satirical 
comments bring no response from Baal, and neither do the prayers of his 
worshippers. The scene depicts Baal as an impotent deity, incapable of answering 
either his supporters or his detractors. 


Elijah then has people pour buckets of water over the sacrifice he’s about to offer. 
Only then, when asking for fire seems hopeless, Elijah calls on God. And the 
response is dramatic. Lightning comes from sky, and the sacrifice is consumed 
by fire. The spectators immediately call out, “The Lord indeed is God; the Lord 
indeed is God.” 


This is Elijah’s moment of triumph, yet he manages to turn his stunning victory 
into defeat by overstepping his bounds. He has all the prophets of Baal herded 
down to the base of the mountain, where he slaughters them. The bloodbath 
ignites a new cycle of opposition, because Jezebel vows that Elijah will pay for it 
with his life. From triumph on the mountain, Elijah must flee again.
Elijah’s Inner Struggle 


In the third phase of the story (1 Kings 19), the focus shifts from Elijah’s 
struggle against the rulers and their gods to his own struggle against despair. 
This part begins with a journey from Mount Carmel in the northern part of the 
country to Mount Horeb or Sinai in the far south. Elijah enters the vastness of 
the desert alone. He tells God that he’s ready to die, but he trudges on until he 
reaches Mount Sinai. There, he spends the night in a cave.


God then speaks to Elijah, asking him why he is hiding out in the middle of 
nowhere. And the prophet has a ready answer: “I’ve been absolutely devoted 
to the Lord, the sovereign God. Because the Israelites have abandoned your 
covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. And 
now, I’m the only one left, and they want to kill me too.”


God responds to Elijah’s tirade by telling him to stand on the mountain before 
him. When Elijah does so, a massive gust of wind shatters the rocks all around, 
an earthquake shakes the ground, and a blazing fire appears. Yet with each 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
96
spectacular display, we are told that God is not present. God is not in the wind, 
the earthquake, or even the fire. Instead, Elijah hears God speak in a still, small 
voice—a quiet whisper. 


God tells Elijah to go back north, toward Damascus, and anoint three people, 
who will orchestrate a military coup in the northern kingdom of Israel. The first 
new leader is Jehu, who will be king over Israel. The second is Hazael, who will 
be king over the neighboring region of Aram or Syria. And the third will be 
Elisha, the prophet who will take Elijah’s place. 


Elijah has become convinced that everything depends on him, that he’s the only 
responsible person left, but before he leaves the mountain, God tells Elijah that 
he’s kidding himself. The prophet is so self-absorbed that he has overlooked the 
fact that he’s not alone. There are thousands of people in Israel who have not 
adopted the ways of Baal. 


This is the climax of the middle phase of Elijah’s story. Here, he’s not confronted 
by the king, the queen, or the prophets of Baal but by his own God. Elijah is 
being summoned to move beyond the perspectives that have driven him into 
hiding in order to do the work to which he is called. 
Return to Center Stage


In the fourth part of the story (1 Kings 21), Elijah again confronts Ahab and 
Jezebel, this time, about the abuse of political authority. The scene is the town 
of Jezreel, where Ahab and Jezebel had a second palace. The man next door was 
named Naboth, and he had a vineyard that Ahab wanted to buy, but Naboth 
wouldn’t sell. 


There seems to have been a clash of principles involved. The king thought that 
everything had its price, and you got what you wanted by paying people what 
they asked. But Naboth wouldn’t sell the land because it belonged to his family. 


Ahab responds to the inability to get his way by sulking and pouting, but Jezebel 
comes on the scene, representing yet another set of principles. She believes that 
those in authority should get what they want. If Naboth won’t sell the land, she 

Lecture 14—Elijah, the Troubler of Israel  
97
will manipulate the system so that she can take the land without paying for it. 
Jezebel fabricates a legal case against Naboth that ends with his execution. The 
moral of the story seems to be that might makes right. 


But Elijah pronounces a different moral. He warns that those who wrongly 
perpetrate violence will suffer violence themselves. Ahab and Jezebel have 
destroyed an innocent man, and they, in turn, will be destroyed. The final 
chapter of 1 Kings shows the grim truth of the prophet’s warning. 
Elijah’s Departure


The final part of Elijah’s story is told in 2 Kings 2. By this point, it’s clear that 
Elijah’s time has run out, even though his work is not complete. The still, 
People assumed that Elijah 
ascended to heaven and 
never died; indeed, the book 
of Malachi promises that 
Elijah will return to reconcile 
parents and their children.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
98
small voice had told him to anoint three people who would bring down the 
government, but Elijah has enlisted only one of them, the prophet Elisha. He has 
also warned that Queen Jezebel will come to a hideous end, yet she is still free. 


What’s intriguing about this part of the story is that it’s an ending that is not 
really an ending. In fact, Elijah’s departure actually opens up the prospect of 
much more to come. Elijah and Elisha travel down to the Jordan River valley. 
As they walk together, a chariot pulled by horses made of fire comes charging 
across the landscape. Then, there is a great whirlwind that carries Elijah up to 
the sky until he vanishes from sight. 


There are many parts of Elijah’s story that we might remember: his life on the 
margins and his flair for street theater; his anger at injustice and his penchant 
for self-absorption. But the most striking part of his story is the way it resists 
closure. Its ending holds the prospect of a new beginning.

Questions to Consider
1.	 A central theme in Elijah’s story is his conflict with King Ahab and Queen 
Jezebel. What did the king and queen find so troublesome about the prophet? 
What did the prophet find so troublesome about the king and queen? 
2.	 The middle section of Elijah’s story tells of his journey to Mount Horeb 
(Sinai), where he voices an angry sense of isolation and despair. In what 
ways is the narrative critical of the prophet? In what ways might this episode 
enhance a reader’s appreciation for the prophet?

LECTURE 15
Justice and Love in Amos and 
Hosea
 I 
n a classic study, the scholar Abraham Heschel called the biblical prophets 
“the most disturbing people who ever lived.” They see and feel things with 
an intensity that modern readers may find inexplicable. Heschel notes that 
we learn to take the world as it is. We know the world’s not perfect, but we get 
used to it. Yet the prophets speak as if the unjust treatment of the poor is a national 
catastrophe. They regard misguided religious practice as a disaster. And the explosive 
quality of the prophets’ words aims at what Heschel calls “a ceaseless shattering of 
indifference.” In this lecture, we’ll look at two of these prophets, Amos and Hosea, 
whose stories come first in Israel’s history.
Amos


The opening line of the book of Amos says that he was a shepherd who lived 
at the village of Tekoa, which was south of Jerusalem. But Amos preaches 
judgment against Israel, which was the kingdom to the north. What’s more, 
Amos lived at a time (about 760 B.C.) when things were relatively peaceful 
and prosperous, at least within Israel and Judah. That impression of prosperity 
would make it difficult for Amos to get a hearing. 


Chapters 1 and 2 show us the prophet’s rhetorical strategy. Amos initially 
condemns the sins of all the surrounding peoples. As he lists the hideous crimes 
that everyone else has done, he allows the people of Israel to feel superior. But 
then he strikes at the center—at Israel itself—pummeling the people for the 
injustice that is rampant in their own society. 


There are seven messages of judgment against other peoples, and each has the 
same form. First, the prophet condemns the violent actions that have been 
committed by each city or region. Second, he warns of the violent destruction 
that is coming because of those actions. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
100
●
●The first city Amos condemns is Damascus, which lies to the north. In Amos 
1:3, he tells us that the people there have threshed the neighboring region 
of Gilead with threshing sledges of iron. They have devastated the region to 
gain plunder, just as a sledge destroys the stalks of wheat to knock loose the 
grain. Because of that, the message warns that Damascus itself will suffer 
destruction in war, and its people will be taken away as captives. 
●
●In the messages that follow, Amos condemns the brutality of Gaza to the 
southwest and Tyre to the northwest. Both are indicted for their role in the 
slave trade. Amos says that both have handed over entire communities to 
Edom, which was to the southwest. And Edom is the next region condemned. 
●
●There are indictments of Ammon and Moab to the east and Judah to the 
south. But then, after pronouncing judgment against all those other peoples, 
Amos finally comes to the center of things: the injustice in Israel itself. In 
Amos 2:6, he says that the people of Israel “sell innocent people for silver, 
and needy people for a pair of sandals. They trample the head of the poor 
into the dust of the earth, and they push those who are destitute out of 
the way.” Here, the prophet declares that the same kind of wrongdoing that 
listeners could see everywhere else was taking place in their own society. 


In chapter 5, Amos makes a scathing critique of the way people use the 
trappings of religion to cover up these social and economic abuses. He says 
that God rejects the festivals and offerings of Israel—a stunning idea given that 
these traditions were mandated. According to Amos, God also rejects the sacred 
music intended to honor him. The prophet’s words are rhetorically powerful, 
because if listeners hear that God does not want the festivals, the offerings, and 
the music, then they have to ask what God does want. 


And here, Amos speaks his most famous line. What God wants is to “Let 
justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” 
The prophet understands that God has a fundamental commitment to forming 
a society in which people are treated decently. Yet the callous indifference to 
human need that the prophet describes is crushing the vulnerable. 


What captured the attention of Amos’s listeners was not only his vision of a just 
society. It was also his warning of judgment, especially his warning about the 
coming collapse of the kingdom and the deportation of its people. In chapter 7, 

Lecture 15—Justice and Love in Amos and Hosea 
101
he warns that the sanctuaries of the country will be destroyed and the royal 
house will fall by the sword. 


In response, one of the priests from the sanctuary at Bethel accuses Amos of 
conspiracy against the government and tells the prophet to return to the south. 
Amos reiterates that disaster is coming. A society that crushes its poorest 
members will eventually be crushed, and the people will be taken away into 
exile. That is, of course, what happened several decades later, when the armies of 
Assyria brought an end to the northern kingdom. 
Hosea


In the book of Hosea, the focus shifts from issues of social justice to the problem 
of unfaithfulness to God. Hosea’s basic assumption is that God loves his people 
deeply, yet he says that God is anguished because estrangement has occurred. 
Hosea shows us a God who feels outrage because he has been rejected, yet a 
God who wants nothing more than to be reconciled with those he loves. 


The opening chapter introduces the theme by involving Hosea in a public 
scandal: God tells the prophet to marry Gomer, a promiscuous woman, whose 
children will come from her adulterous relationships. The scene is intentionally 
shocking. To have Hosea marry someone who would sleep around with 
other men made a mockery of basic values. Yet the prophet was to live in this 
scandalous relationship to show how scandalous it was for God to have his 
people prove unfaithful to him. 


The underlying idea is that God’s relationship with Israel involves mutual 
commitment. For Hosea, God showed his commitment by delivering his people 
out of slavery in Egypt and bringing them to the land of Canaan, as he had 
promised. That meant, in turn, that people were to be faithful to God. Yet 
Hosea lived in a context where it was common for people to participate in local 
cults, particularly that of Baal. 


In Hosea’s eyes, worshipping Baal seemed to violate Israel’s unique relationship 
with the God who delivered them from slavery. For him, that relationship was 
not one among many. It centered on a religious covenant that gave Israel its 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
102
identity as a people. For Hosea, worshipping Baal was like having an extramarital 
affair. And just as sexual infidelity could end a marriage, religious infidelity 
could end Israel’s covenant with the God of the Exodus. If that happened, Israel 
would no longer exist as a people. 


Hosea’s task was to shock people by his marriage to Gomer. He could expect 
people to react to the scandal by asking how he could possibly allow the 
marriage to continue. The prophet could then ask how God could possibly 
allow his marriage with Israel to continue, given their infidelity.


To underscore God’s outrage at the situation, Hosea gives the three children 
in this family symbolic names. The first child is Jezreel, a name associated with 
a place of violence and destruction in Israel. The second child is Lo-ruhamah, 
which means “not pitied,” and the third child is Lo-ammi, which means “not 
my people.”
The dominant form of local 
fertility cults centered on the 
god Baal, who was said to make 
rainfall (Baal’s temple at Palmyra).

Chapter 2 shows dramatic movement. It begins with divine outrage at Israel’s 
infidelity in disturbing language. But it ends with the prospect of reconciliation 
and the hope that God’s marriage with Israel can be restored.
●
●Hosea 2:2 sets the basic direction. It’s a plea from God that Israel—his wife—
give up her adulterous relationships. Change is what God desires. But starting 
Hosea’s portrayal of God as 
an outraged husband may 
evoke images of domestic 
violence, whether in the 
prophet’s time or in our own.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
104
in verse 3, the prophet depicts an explosion of feeling. God vents the rage that 
comes from a sense of betrayal, threatening to put his wife into the street.
●
●Rather than condoning domestic violence, the text here is assuming that the 
intensity of divine anger matches the intensity of divine love. God is outraged 
because the relationship matters, and he does not want to give up on it. 


But then, in chapter 2, beginning with verse 14, Hosea pictures God recognizing 
that anger can never win Israel back. If God wants the relationship to continue, 
he must speak tenderly to Israel’s heart. Hosea says that God wants Israel to call 
him her husband once again. To enable people to do that, the prophet offers 
a vision of reconciliation. He pictures a context in which the cycle of violence 
ends and life is characterized by justice, love, and mercy.
Israel and Assyria


Hosea lived at the time when the Assyrians were expanding their empire. They 
initially dominated the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in what 
today is the country of Iraq. But beginning in 745 B.C., they embarked on a 
campaign of military conquest. Over the next two decades, they conquered 
territory from the Persian Gulf in the east to the border of Egypt in the west. By 
733 B.C., the Assyrians had captured most of the land in north and central Israel. 


Against this backdrop, Hosea 11 pictures God as the devoted parent of a 
rebellious child. The opening line says, “When Israel was a child, I loved him, 
and out of Egypt I called my son.” Yet the child took up with the wrong crowd 
and kept sacrificing to Baal. The more God reached out to him, the more the 
child rejected his parental love. 


Hosea expresses the heartfelt anguish of God. He pictures God as a parent, 
teaching the child to walk or tending to him when he was sick. The tragedy is 
that when Israel grew up, this child of God ran away and would now suffer the 
destructive consequences of his actions. Hosea says that the people will return 
to the land of Egypt, as if going back to slavery again. He explains that he means 
that Assyria will be their king.



As he sees what is coming, God says, “How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How 
can I hand you over, O Israel?” On the one hand, God can see that he must let 
his child’s rebellious actions take their course. Yet on the other hand, he can’t 
bear it, because doing so will be disastrous.


The passage ends with a note of hope. The prophet can see that Assyria will 
conquer, yet he holds out the prospect of a future that extends beyond the 
disaster. He pictures God calling his rebellious child once again.

LECTURE 16
Isaiah on Defiant Hope
 I 
saiah is one of the most widely read prophetic texts in the Bible. It’s rather 
long, and its contents are rich and varied, but perhaps the one feature that 
has contributed most to its popularity are its visions of hope. Of course, the 
book has scenes of outrage at injustice and hypocrisy, which in the prophet’s eyes 
are destroying society. Yet the visions of hope also challenge the audience to resist 
the tendency toward despair—closing off the possibility of a different future. We will 
explore Isaiah 1–39, and as we proceed, we’ll ask how hope relates to five aspects of 
the prophet’s message: confrontation, purification, realism, passion, and vulnerability.
Hope and Confrontation


In chapter 1, the prophet Isaiah pictures God bringing a lawsuit against his own 
people, summoning heaven and earth to serve as his witnesses. God contends 
that he’s been a dutiful parent, but his children have rebelled against him and 
acted corruptly; parent and children are now estranged. 
In Isaiah, scenes of peace and 
harmony can appear side 
by side with sharp words of 
warning and indictment.

Lecture 16—Isaiah on Defiant Hope 
107


Later in the chapter, the prophet gives us glimpses of the corruption that 
permeates society. He tells of those who pervert justice and of public officials 
who abuse their authority. Meanwhile, the weakest members of society suffer 
under their corrupt leadership. Those in authority have failed in their duty to 
care for orphans and widows. 


Isaiah also confronts religious hypocrisy. He says that people might bring 
countless sacrifices to the temple, but God doesn’t want them. They celebrate 
all the religious holidays, but God detests the pageantry. They piously stretch 
out their hands in prayer, but God won’t listen. In the prophet’s eyes, offering 
incense to God can never be a substitute for fair treatment of other people. In 
this, Isaiah is much like Amos. 


The people who first heard Isaiah could presumably have told him that he lacked 
perspective. After all, the nation was in crisis and people in authority were 
focused on larger issues. Foreign armies were devouring territory all around, 
and Jerusalem seemed to be the one place still standing. Thus, the defendants 
in this court case might ask him, “Why worry about orphans and widows when 
national survival is at stake?” 


This is where Isaiah reframes the issue, insisting that the fact that Jerusalem has 
survived actually presents an opportunity. It’s not that all the chaos means that 
God has abandoned Israel but just the opposite: In the face of chaos, God has 
preserved the city. And by doing so, he gives people the opportunity to change. 
That’s why this opening lawsuit culminates when the prophet says that hope for 
the future calls for change in the present. For Isaiah, society must not only be 
preserved, but it must be worth preserving. And such a society must have justice 
at its heart. 


It is striking to read the account of God’s indictment of his people in chapter 
1 alongside the hope depicted in chapter 2. Here, Isaiah envisions a city that is 
no longer filled with corruption but is a center of learning. Nations no longer 
threaten to invade but come seeking knowledge. The vision climaxes when they 
“beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation 
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
108


In its context in Isaiah, this vision of peace in chapter 2 is as confrontational 
as the lawsuit in chapter 1. Both passages challenge the destructive patterns of 
behavior that the prophet sees in his own society. Where the lawsuit identifies 
the need for change, the hope for peace identifies the direction. Isaiah had 
no reason to think his vision would be realized any time soon, but the image 
of nations turning swords into plowshares was designed to generate a restless 
dissatisfaction with the norm. 
Hope and Purification


The relationship of hope to purification is explored in chapter 6, where Isaiah 
receives his commission as a prophet. In this vision, he is confronted with the 
awe-inspiring holiness of God, who is seated on a throne in the temple. Above 
him are seraphim (Hebrew: “fiery ones”), each with six wings.


The seraphim call out, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full 
of his glory.” As we’ve seen in previous lectures, God’s holiness is his “otherness.” 
It is the numinous quality that distinguishes God from all other beings. Holiness 
conveys absolute purity, intense power, and overwhelming majesty. 


The doorframes of the temple shake, and the entire sanctuary is filled with 
smoke. In this liminal moment, the magnitude of God’s presence makes Isaiah 
aware of his own smallness and vulnerability. God’s absolute purity makes 
him aware of his own impurity and the impurity of Israel. His uncleanness 
makes him unfit to stand in the presence of the Holy One, and it threatens 
to destroy him. 


Yet in the vision, Isaiah is not destroyed but purified. One of the seraphim 
touches Isaiah’s lips with a burning coal and tells him, “Now that this has 
touched your lips, your guilt is removed and your sin is purged away.” The 
element of hope lies in feeling the heat and being cleansed by it. That experience 
changes the prophet. When God asks who he should send to the people of 
Israel, Isaiah replies, “Here I am, send me.” 


Isaiah then learns that the experience of fire will take place on the national level. 
Israel itself will feel the heat of conflict. God sends Isaiah to deliver a message 

Lecture 16—Isaiah on Defiant Hope 
109
that initially seems absurd. He is to tell the people, “Go ahead; keep listening. 
You’ll never understand. Go ahead; keep looking. You’ll never really see.” God 
explains that the prophet’s words will make them cover their ears and close their 
eyes, because if they understood what was happening, they would turn to God 
and be healed. 


These words were designed to function as a challenge. They’re meant to 
provoke people into replying that the prophet must be wrong, because they can 
understand. That’s why in chapters to come, the prophet will repeatedly call 
people to greater awareness of the situation. But when Isaiah asks how long he 
must persist in this work, God tells him he must do so until cities lie in ruins 
and houses stand empty; until the country has been ravaged and people have 
been sent away. 


Yet these ominous words conclude with a cryptic image that holds out the 
prospect of new life emerging from the ashes. Isaiah pictures the nation as a tree 
that has been cut down, yet the stump remains. And where there is a stump, 
there are roots underground. The image suggests that just as Isaiah was purified 
by fire yet survived, so, too, would the nation, which might be devastated but 
would live on.
Hope and Realism


We can see this idea developed in the next part of the book, chapters 7 and 
8, which reflect a time when the Assyrian Empire was expanding. The kings 
of Syria and Israel—north of Judah—wanted to form a coalition to resist the 
Assyrian invasion, but King Ahaz, who ruled in Jerusalem, apparently refused to 
join them. Thus, they threatened to overthrow Ahaz’s government and replace 
him with a new king. 


The threat raises profound questions about the way hope relates to realism. 
Isaiah tells King Ahaz not to take any rash action and things will work out, but 
that does not seem realistic to Ahaz. The prophet underscores his message by 
referring to three children with symbolic names. His meaning is that Judah will 
survive the Assyrian attacks, at least for now. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
110


In these chapters, Isaiah offers a message of hope that is couched in brutal 
realism. He promises a future in which life continues, but it continues in the 
face of loss and suffering. Isaiah’s perspective on hope doesn’t negate the reality 
of the threat. Rather, he offers a way to live on in the face of the threat. In the 
years that followed, the Assyrian forces conquered Syria and Israel’s capital, but 
Judah remained.
Hope and Passion


In chapter 9, Isaiah announces the coming of a day in which peace triumphs 
over war. He envisions a scene in which the boots and bloodstained clothes of 
battle are gathered up and destroyed. Then, he announces the birth of a child, 
a descendant of David, who will reign as king. His kingdom will be based on 
justice and righteousness, and in it, there will be endless peace. 
In the crisis years of 735 to 
732 B.C., the armies of the 
Assyrians were advancing 
from the northeast, and people 
in the region had to decide 
whether to resist or surrender.

Lecture 16—Isaiah on Defiant Hope 
111


We have seen Isaiah depicting scenes of conflict and military invasion. And 
in that traumatic context, people had to wonder what God was doing. Thus, 
Isaiah’s vision of hope identifies what he considers to be God’s fundamental 
passion—his “zeal.” 


Isaiah lived in a situation that was deeply discouraging. But through his visions, 
such as that of the peaceable kingdom, the prophet insisted that God was not 
held captive by human conflict. Neither the Assyrians nor any other invading 
power could ultimately set the terms for the future. For Isaiah, God’s passion 
was for a future in which the patterns of destruction would be overcome, and 
society would be reoriented toward human well-being. 
Hope and Vulnerability


Chapters 36 through 39 give us episodes from the latter part of Isaiah’s career. 
Several decades have passed, and King Ahaz’s son Hezekiah is now on the throne. 
He is described as a religious reformer, emphasizing the central importance of 
Israel’s God. 


Hezekiah also asserted Judah’s independence in the face of Assyrian domination. 
His political resistance triggered a violent countermove by the Assyrians, and their 
armies ravaged the country in 701 B.C. As the Assyrians closed in, their own 
records say that they had Hezekiah trapped in Jerusalem, like a bird in a cage.


Chapter 36 begins with an Assyrian official traveling from the besieged city 
of Lachish to Jerusalem. There, he ridicules Hezekiah and demands that he 
surrender. Ultimately, the official becomes arrogant and insists that Israel’s God 
is powerless to stop the Assyrian advance. 


In chapter 37, Hezekiah turns to Isaiah for help. He asks the prophet to pray 
for the remnant of the country that remains, and Isaiah sends back a word of 
assurance. As before, the king should take no rash action. The Assyrians will 
hear a rumor and return to their own land. 


Then, we find the prophet repeating the message of hope used earlier. The 
remnant that remains will send its roots deep into the soil and send shoots 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
112
upward to bear fruit. Jerusalem will be the center from which life will spring up 
again in the wake of devastation. 


Finally, the Assyrians withdraw and Jerusalem is spared. The country would 
survive for another century.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Many of Isaiah’s most famous visions use poetic imagery: wolves living 
peacefully with lambs, swords being turned into plowshares, the dawning of 
a new day. Why might readers find these poetic depictions of hope engaging?
2.	 At several points, Isaiah refers to God preserving a “remnant” of the people. 
In what kind of situation might that be heard as good news? In what kind of 
situation would it be heard as a threat?

LECTURE 17
Jeremiah on Anguish and 
Compassion
 I 
n this lecture, we turn to the book of Jeremiah, which we might characterize 
with the word pathos—a profound depth of feeling. Pathos occurs at a point 
where love and anger, grief and longing all collide. The book of Jeremiah 
churns with the anger the prophet feels toward the faithlessness he sees in his 
society, yet it conveys the poignancy of love for a people seemingly bent on their 
own destruction. As we’ll see, God tells Jeremiah that his message will be both 
critical and constructive. He will work to overthrow the illusions of entitlement 
and security that perpetuate unfaithfulness and injustice, yet he will also build up a 
vision of hope for the future.
The Pathos of God


Like many of the other prophets, Jeremiah was a poet, and chapters 2 to 4 of 
his book consist of poems about God’s turbulent love affair with his people. 
For modern readers, the poems are something like the verses in a popular song. 
They tell of romance and betrayal, of unfaithfulness and desire. What makes 
Jeremiah’s poetry different is that he takes the pathos from a human level to a 
divine level. 


In chapter 2, God wistfully remembers the old days, when love was young and 
sweet. The lyrics look back to when the people came out of Egypt at the time 
of the Exodus. They were like a young bride, setting out on a new life with 
her husband. Although life was hard, the people and God traveled through the 
desert together, and that made all the difference. 


But when God’s people settled down, things starting coming apart. The people 
got restless and went looking for other lovers. The pathos is heightened as God 
grieves over what has happened. He asks what was so wrong that his people 
went so far away from him. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
114


As the lyrics go on, God’s grief turns to anger at this sense of betrayal, and by 
chapter 3, he is thinking of a “divorce.” Here, Jeremiah is referring to people 
participating in fertility cults and acts of devotion to other deities. He portrays 
the people as a promiscuous wife, much as Hosea did on the same issue. 


In conveying the confrontational side of the prophet’s message, however, the 
underlying sense of love doesn’t disappear. Instead, it turns into God’s longing for 
reconciliation, and that’s where the constructive aspect comes in. In the last half 
of chapter 3 and the beginning of chapter 4, God asks “faithless Israel” to return.
The Shattering of Illusions


If reconciliation between God and Israel is the goal, what would prevent that 
from happening? For Jeremiah, a major problem is that people are living with 
the illusion that nothing is wrong and their position is secure. He tries to shatter 
that illusion through his words and actions. 


A pivotal moment is a speech he delivers at the temple. Keep in mind that 
people understood the temple to be a visible sign of God’s presence among 
them. Further, many assumed that as long as God was present, he would 
protect them; thus, the temple gave them a sense of security. But for Jeremiah, 
it is absurd to think that God will ignore unethical conduct simply because the 
people maintain the temple rituals. 


In chapter 7, Jeremiah delivers his Temple Sermon. He positions himself at the 
gate leading into the temple and calls out that the people must change their way 
of living. Not surprisingly, people entering the temple are annoyed. 


Jeremiah’s initial argument fits the constructive side of his message. He says that 
if the people link ethical conduct to worship in the temple, things will be fine. 
But they must act justly with one another, not oppress the vulnerable, and not 
worship other deities. 


For the rest of the speech, the critical side of the message predominates. 
Jeremiah accuses people of treating the temple like a robbers’ den. He pictures 
people engaging in all kinds of unethical behavior in daily life, then coming 

Lecture 17—Jeremiah on Anguish and Compassion 
115
Jeremiah’s commission to 
prophecy is somewhat unsettling 
because he learns that his life is 
not his own; God has set him 
apart for purposes that are not 
of his choosing.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
116
to the temple—where they think they are safe—as if their unethical behavior 
didn’t matter. Jeremiah insists that it’s nothing but an illusion to think that the 
temple provides cover for those who engage in unethical conduct elsewhere.


Later, Jeremiah continues to shatter illusions by considering Israel’s status as 
God’s chosen people. Again, he challenges the idea that belonging to God 
meant the people were protected no matter what. 
●
●In chapter 18, Jeremiah uses the image of a potter working with clay for God’s 
relationship to Israel. He says that if Israel’s life has become misshapen—if 
social patterns have become warped—then God can take them through a 
process of collapse and rebuilding. Like the potter, God can shape the nation 
into a different form. Institutions can be pulled down and remade. And the 
image people have of themselves can be crushed and refashioned. 
●
●Of course, the texture of clay is variable, and the potter must respond 
accordingly. He must change his approach according to the nature of the 
clay. In the same way, God might start with a wonderful design in mind, but 
if people prove to be too resistant, then God will alter his plans and reshape 
society into a new form. If people begin to respond well, then God, too, will 
respond favorably and change.


Both the Temple Sermon and the image of the potter and clay are intended 
to shatter the illusions of security that Jeremiah thought stood in the way of 
change. These passages include constructive elements, but the critical aspects 
are dominant, and reactions to Jeremiah’s message are largely negative. In 
chapter 20, an official in the temple has Jeremiah arrested, beaten, and placed in 
confinement overnight.
The Pathos of Jeremiah


The pathos of Jeremiah himself centers on his struggle with shame. That may 
seem surprising, because Jeremiah has seemed so strident in his public criticism 
of popular beliefs. But he is human, and shame is deeply connected to the human 
need to be valued. People typically do what will bring approval from those whose 
opinions matter to them and try to avoid being shamed or humiliated, because it 
brings a painful sense of losing one’s value in the eyes of others.

Lecture 17—Jeremiah on Anguish and Compassion 
117


Jeremiah puts his pathos into the poetic form of a lament (Jer. 20:7–13), 
taking people on a journey from despair into hope. The opening lines here are 
a seething expression of anger and despair directed at God, because God has 
made Jeremiah’s life miserable. Jeremiah appears to say that God has deceived 
him into serving as a prophet.


In verses 8 and 9, Jeremiah says that he has dutifully spoken out against destructive 
social and religious practices, but people think he’s laughable. He no longer wants 
to be a prophet. The problem is that his internal sense of calling persists.


To be true to his convictions, he must overcome his shame. He needs a sense 
of purpose that comes from something higher than public opinion. And for 
Jeremiah, that’s where God comes in. The poem pictures God as a warrior, 
doing battle for the prophet. It’s Jeremiah’s sense that God’s truth will win out 
that enables him to continue speaking. 


However, there’s another lament in verses 14 to 18, and it begins, “Cursed be 
the day that I was born.” In this lament, there is no movement toward hope, 
only a relentless march into despair. Here, there is no word of praise at the end, 
only the haunting question: “Why did I ever come out of the womb, to see 
trouble and grief, and end my days in shame?” This poem gives no answer. It 
voices only the pathos.


The juxtaposition of these two laments in chapter 20 shows us a life in which 
grief and hope exist side by side. The hopeful conclusion of the first lament does 
not silence the grief expressed in the second. But neither does the grief mean 
that hope has no place. Jeremiah’s ability to engage both of them together marks 
the pathos of this prophet.
Hope Rising from Collapse


This kind of tension persists in the final section of the book, which narrates the 
country’s collapse yet asks how hope might rise from the ashes. In 597 B.C., the 
Babylonians raided the temple in Jerusalem and carried off sacred objects. They 
also deported some of the leading citizens, including the king, and replaced him 
with a king of their own choosing. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
118


In chapters 27 to 29, we learn that there were competing prophets, whose 
visions of hope were dramatically different. Some prophets said that despite the 
losses, the good times were coming back. The heart of their message was that no 
change was necessary. All people needed to do was resist any more Babylonian 
encroachments. 


But Jeremiah said the opposite. He envisioned a future in which his people 
would have to survive even as institutions collapsed. They would have to forge 
an identity that could persist in the absence of a temple, a king, or a country. 
His vision of hope was counterintuitive. He said that the way into the future 
was through acceptance, not resistance. He insisted that people should accept 
Babylonian rule, and that would allow them to survive. 


The Babylonians completed the process of conquest in 587 B.C. In the chaos that 
ensued, a group of people fled from Jerusalem to Egypt and forced Jeremiah to go 
with them. There, in Egypt, the prophet ended his career. He became a refugee.


As the old world vanished, however, Jeremiah promised that the nation would 
survive. The identity of the people of Israel and Judah would continue, though 
Jeremiah wore a yoke, 
like an ox, to make 
the point that people 
would find life by 
accepting loss; the 
old institutions were 
ending, and the only 
way forward was to 
shoulder a new reality.

Lecture 17—Jeremiah on Anguish and Compassion 
119
the form of life that they knew would change. And in one of the most striking 
passages in the book (Jer. 31:31–34), he offers hope for the establishment of a 
new covenant. 


Jeremiah’s vision for the future is not a simple extension of the past. He’s keenly 
aware that unfaithfulness has been going on for generations, and if there is to be 
a future, the underlying pattern must change. The kind of change of heart that 
is needed will center on the act of forgiveness.


Here, forgiveness means declaring that the past does not determine the future. 
The prophet insisted that the destructive patterns of the past had culminated 
in the breakdown of the nation, and people had to own that. But he also 
recognized that if the actions of the past set the terms for the future, then there 
was no future. Thus, in this passage, forgiveness is what creates the possibility of 
something new. It means declaring that the past need not determine the future. 
And for Jeremiah, such renewal would express the pathos of God’s longing for 
reconciliation.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The book of Jeremiah offers a complex portrayal of the prophet. At what 
points did Jeremiah seem most willing to speak for God? What were the 
main reasons he struggled against God?
2.	 What aspects of Jeremiah’s message did people of his own time find most 
objectionable? What aspects of his message might people have found most 
valuable in the years that followed the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem?

LECTURE 18
Babylonian Conquest and 
Exile
 T 
he fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 B.C. was a pivotal 
moment in the story of the people of Israel and Judah. These events also 
raised larger questions about human responses to the trauma of loss, to 
which the Bible does not offer simple answers. In this lecture, we’ll look at three 
perspectives that appear in writings from the period just before and after the fall of 
Jerusalem. First, the book of 2 Kings tries to explain the loss; second, Lamentations 
expresses the loss; and third, the book of Habakkuk offers a way through the loss, by 
finding a way to live with unanswered questions. 
Explaining Loss: 2 Kings


The final episodes in the story of the monarchy in Israel are narrated in 2 Kings. 
Earlier, the books of Joshua and Judges told of Israel’s movement from the 
desert into Canaan. Then, 1 and 2 Samuel recounted the establishment of the 
monarchy under Saul and David. The book of 1 Kings continued the story, from 
the brutal grandeur of King Solomon to the shattering of national unity under 
his son and the ongoing struggles of a divided kingdom. Now, 2 Kings brings the 
tale to its tragic conclusion, recounting the conquest of the northern kingdom by 
the Assyrians and the destruction of the southern kingdom by the Babylonians.


The writings in this Deuteronomistic history, as it is known, use exclusive 
loyalty to Israel’s God as the lens through which they interpret the rise and fall 
of the monarchy. They regard Israel’s entry into the land of Canaan and the 
establishment of the Davidic dynasty as gracious acts of God. And they try to 
make sense of the tragic end of the northern and southern kingdoms by insisting 
that these events happened because Israel was unfaithful to God. Because they 
turned away from God, God handed the people over to the invading armies 
that destroyed their cities and took them into exile. 

Lecture 18—Babylonian Conquest and Exile 
121


We find this explanation in 2 Kings 17, which narrates the Assyrian victory 
over the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 B.C. At the time, that event seemed 
incomprehensible, because people believed they had been brought into that 
region by God. But they were forcibly uprooted, and the Assyrians brought in 
colonists from other nations to occupy the land. 


The book of 2 Kings explains that this happened because the people of the 
north had sinned against the God who had liberated them from slavery in 
Egypt. Although God had made a covenant with them, they rejected it by 
worshipping other gods. The writer insists that God had tried to restore the 
relationship by sending prophets, but the people refused to listen. And because 
they worshipped the gods of other nations, God allowed them to be conquered 
by another nation, namely, Assyria. 


The book uses the same perspective to explain the Babylonian triumph over 
the southern kingdom in 587 B.C. Here, the issues were even more complex, 
because people believed that God had chosen Jerusalem to be the capital. 
People wondered whether God had actually wanted to save the city and the 
temple but had failed. 


Chapters 23 and 24 insist that the fall of Jerusalem was God’s judgment on the 
unfaithfulness of the people and their rulers, not his own failure. Because they 
had turned away from God by their idolatry, God turned away from them and 
brought in the Babylonians. When the destruction of the city is finally described 
in the last chapter, readers are to see it as a sovereign act of divine judgment on 
the sins of the people.
Expressing Loss: Lamentations


The book of Lamentations also comes from the period after the fall of Jerusalem. 
But the writer challenges the attempt to make logical sense of the tragedy by 
allowing the voices of the victims to be heard. Lamentations consists of five 
poems, and one of its most distinctive aspects is the interplay of voices in the 
poems. These voices offer different perspectives on the experience of loss. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
122


For example, the opening chapter includes two voices. The first half of the poem 
is written in the third person, by someone who stands at a distance and makes 
observations about the tragic destruction of Jerusalem. The last half of the poem 
is written in the first person, by someone at the center of the devastation, who 
tells us what it feels like to be the victim. 
●
●The third-person observer’s tone is gentle and sympathetic. He personifies 
the ruined city of Jerusalem as a woman, who “weeps bitterly in the night” 
and “has no one to comfort her.” However, the observer assumes that the 
usual explanation for the tragedy of Jerusalem’s conquest is accurate. As sad 
as it is, the city must have deserved destruction. 
●
●In the last half of verse 11, a different voice intrudes. Here, the victim herself 
begins to speak. As a challenge to these detached observations, she calls for 
a closer look at the magnitude of her suffering, and she pushes back against 
the idea that suffering can logically be explained as a fair punishment from 
God. The severity of the devastation calls into question any notion of justice. 
●
●As the poem concludes in verses 18 to 22, the woman brings the question of 
divine justice full circle. She concludes that she has been a rebel, but she also 
demands to know whether God has singled her out for special punishment. 
Clearly, the men who ravaged the city have sinned as much as she has. If 
God is as just as people say, then he should deal with the perpetrators of the 
violence in the same way he has dealt with her as the victim. The poem ends 
with these issues raised but left unresolved. 


The second chapter returns to the perspective of the observer, pressing the 
traditional explanation of suffering as punishment to the breaking point. In the 
first 10 verses, the image of a just God fades from view; instead, God is seen as 
the terrifying agent of destruction. The observer even calls God the enemy who 
slaughtered the people and ruined the temple. 
●
●Midway through the chapter, the victim’s voice is heard again. Here, she 
confronts God with the appalling conditions of the siege that led to the city’s 
fall. As the enemy surrounded the city, people were reduced to starvation, 
and some held on to life by eating human flesh. The woman accuses God: 
“You slaughtered them and showed no mercy.” 
●
●In Lamentations, the enormity of the suffering defies explanation. The 
book’s resistance to premature closure is one of its most important aspects, 

Lecture 18—Babylonian Conquest and Exile 
123
yet it’s also true that the poet’s act of expressing grief may itself be a step 
toward healing. The content of the poetry is a raging mass of raw emotion 
that would fester like an infected wound if it never saw the light of day. The 
poetry expresses the pain in a form that begins moving through it. 
Finding a Way through Loss: Habakkuk


The book of Habakkuk takes up the issue of what it means to live in the face of 
unanswered questions. Habakkuk was written in the years just before the fall of 
Jerusalem, at a time when the country was plagued by internal social problems 
and corrupt leadership, even as the external threat of the Babylonian invasion 
was intensifying.


The opening chapter of Habakkuk is a dialogue between the prophet and God. 
In verses 2 to 4, the prophet begins the dialogue by sounding the alarm about 
the corruption and lawlessness that are rampant in society. And he makes clear 
that God’s apparent indifference to it all is a major part of the problem. 


In an attempt to wake up the sleeping deity, the prophet waves the daily news 
under God’s nose. He points his finger at all the reports of destruction and 
violence, conflict and factionalism. It is astounding that God seems oblivious 
to it all.


In verses 5 to 11, God tells Habakkuk that he plans to bring in the Babylonian 
army to deal with all the corruption in Jerusalem. Yet to the prophet, this only 
makes matters worse. What is especially incomprehensible is that in this part of 
the dialogue, God points out how brutally well-suited the Babylonians are for 
the task of destruction.


In verses 12 to 17, the prophet protests that bringing the Babylonians against 
Jerusalem violates God’s own principles. As the deity, God is not supposed to 
look on in silence while the wicked swallow up those who are more righteous 
than they are. 


At the beginning of chapter 2, Habakkuk compares himself to a guard who 
climbs up into a watchtower on a city wall. From that position, he waits to see 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
124
what kind of answer God will send him. God responds by telling him to write 
down a message on tablets. The message speaks of a vision that still awaits its 
time. But at present, the righteous live by faith.
●
●God’s comment about the vision that awaits its time seems to anticipate 
what is said in the rest of chapter 2. There, the point is that those who 
perpetrate violence will become the victims of violence. The oppressors may 
now have the upper hand, but they will not endure forever. Thus, at present, 
the righteous live by faith. 
●
●This is a turning point in the text. Here, the prophet learns that faith is not 
the answer to his questions. Rather, faith is a way of life. Although he could 
expect the oppressors to lose out in the end, how long that would take was 
completely unclear. In the prophet’s context, the injustice remained real. And 
the more he tried to make sense of things, the more enigmatic they became. 
●
●Habakkuk is unwilling to accept easy answers to difficult questions, yet he 
recognizes that one must also live on, despite the ambiguity. For Habakkuk, 
Habakkuk’s closing lines 
compare faith to the nimble 
movements of a creature who 
can negotiate barren landscapes 
and rocky slopes—a deer who 
moves surefootedly even in 
desolate and perilous places.

Lecture 18—Babylonian Conquest and Exile 
125
the alternative to faith is despair—and despair is ultimately debilitating. 
Thus, for him, faith is an act of defiance. It’s his militant commitment to life 
in a situation that could drain life away. 
●
●He puts this defiant hope into poetic form in the final lines of the book, 
where he pictures a world that apparently holds no promise for the future: “a 
fig tree [that] does not blossom,” “fields [that] yield no food.” It’s a scene in 
which there is nothing that would warrant hope.
●
●Yet it’s precisely at this point that the prophet voices his defiance in a new 
way. He faces all the reasons that would make a person despair yet refuses to 
capitulate. Instead, he continues, “As for me, I will rejoice in the Lord. I will 
joy in the God of my salvation. God, the Lord, is my strength.”

Questions to Consider
1.	 The book of 2 Kings tries to identify reasons for the destruction of Jerusalem 
and its temple, the end of the Davidic monarchy, and the exile of the people. 
Why might people living after those events have thought it important to 
explain what happened? Can you think of modern analogies to such attempts 
to make sense of tragic events?
2.	 Lamentations and Habakkuk both respond to issues raised by the Babylonian 
invasion of Jerusalem. How are their perspectives similar to each other? How 
are they different?

LECTURE 19
Ezekiel on Abandonment and 
Homecoming
 I 
n this lecture, we consider the prophet Ezekiel, who was deported from 
Jerusalem during the first wave of the Babylonian invasion of Judah in 597 
B.C. Over the next 10 years, while Jeremiah prophesied in Jerusalem, Ezekiel 
worked among the people in exile. When Jerusalem was destroyed in 587 B.C., 
Ezekiel stayed among the exiles in Babylon for another 15 years, an experience that 
gave him a profound sense of dislocation. Given this sense, we’ll read the book with 
two themes in mind: abandonment (Ezek. 1–32) and homecoming (Ezek. 33–48). 
Vision of God on a Chariot


According to the first verse of Ezekiel, one day, when the prophet was 30 years 
old and was working among the exiles, the heavens were opened and he saw 
visions of God. For modern readers, the scenes that follow are surreal, even 
bizarre. But for ancient readers, they were explosive, threatening to overwhelm 
people with their descriptions of the numinous presence of God. 


The prophet’s vision begins when he feels a surge of wind. He sees a cloud 
glowing with light approach and repeated flashes of lightning. Then he sees 
four creatures, the likes of which exist nowhere on earth. Each creature has four 
wings, and under the wings are human hands. Their legs are straight and their 
feet are like the hooves of a calf. Each creature also has four faces—that of a 
human, a lion, an ox, and an eagle—each looking in a different direction. 


Ezekiel pictures the bizarre creatures pulling a chariot, which serves as God’s 
throne. In this vision, the chariot has not two but four wheels—one for each 
creature. And as the creatures rise up from the earth, the wheels rise up along 
with them. Above the creatures is a dome that shines like crystal and a throne 
that looks like a jewel. And on the throne is a figure who burns like fire and is 
surrounded by a rainbow. 

Lecture 19—Ezekiel on Abandonment and Homecoming 
127


As we said, Ezekiel had a profound sense of dislocation. He was far from home 
and the temple, where God was understood to be present. Thus, it’s remarkable 
that God comes to the prophet while he’s in exile. The point is that God has not 
abandoned those who have been deported. He is present with them. That’s why 
the wheels of the chariot are so important: God is not confined to the temple in 
Jerusalem. He is quite capable of movement. In a sense, Ezekiel revitalizes the 
older tradition of God traveling with the people. 


Ezekiel’s initial vision of the throne-chariot culminates when he’s given the task 
of prophesying to people who don’t want to hear what he has to say. In chapters 
2 and 3, God hands Ezekiel a scroll, with words of lament, grief, and woe written 
on both sides. The prophet is told to eat the scroll, which he does, taking the 
message into himself. In the chapters to come, he communicates that message of 
lament, grief, and woe in visions that would certainly have provoked opposition. 


Chapters 8 to 11—spoken to the exiles but set in the period before the fall of 
Jerusalem—give a vivid sense of the ominous side of Ezekiel’s message. Sitting 
among the exiled leaders, Ezekiel warns that as the people have abandoned 
God by their idolatry, God will abandon Jerusalem to foreign invasion. Then a 
strange being, who is blazing with fire, appears and grabs Ezekiel by the hair; in 
a vision, he is transported to the temple in Jerusalem. 


In the temple, Ezekiel sees four examples of people abandoning God by idolatry, 
including one of a group worshipping the sun. As this vision continues, it will 
warn that because people have abandoned God for foreign deities, God will 
abandon Jerusalem and its temple to foreign armies. 


In chapter 9, the prophet envisions a scene of slaughter that is both horrific and 
surreal; only those who refuse to share in Israel’s idolatry are spared. The scene is 
so terrible that Ezekiel himself must protest. He asks how God can call for such 
wholesale destruction, but God refuses to stop. Ultimately, God’s chariot rises 
up from the temple, a sign that he is abandoning his sanctuary.


This section seems to set up a clash of perspectives. On the one hand, it has a 
kind of ruthless logic: God abandons the city where the people have abandoned 
him. The people must accept this judgment because it’s the will of God. On the 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
128
Ezekiel came from a family 
of priests yet had been forcibly 
separated from the temple, 
adding to his sense of dislocation 
from Jerusalem.

Lecture 19—Ezekiel on Abandonment and Homecoming 
129
other hand, the prophet can’t accept it; he must protest. It’s unconscionable to 
think that God would act in this way. He has to wonder how such carnage can 
really be the will of God. 
The Shepherd as a Leader


In Ezekiel 33:21, the prophet receives word that the city of Jerusalem has 
fallen. But once the worst has happened, he can now see things from a different 
angle. Instead of construing the tragic events as divine punishment, he can see 
them arising from the failures of human leadership. Here, he focuses on the 
fact that the self-serving practices of people in authority had brought about 
these devastating consequences. In light of that reframing of the issue, the new 
question is how God will respond to human failure and how God’s commitment 
to the renewal of life and well-being will take shape. 


Chapter 34 introduces this remarkable change in perspective by using the image 
of a shepherd. In the ancient world, this image was a common metaphor for a 
king or other leader, who both protected and disciplined his flock. The book of 
Ezekiel uses the shepherd metaphor to offer a pointed critique of the failures of 
leadership in Israel.


In the opening lines, Ezekiel reports that God has castigated the leaders of Israel, 
who have used their positions to enrich themselves while neglecting the welfare 
of others. God compares them to shepherds who eat the fat, take the wool, and 
slaughter the sheep for their banquets but fail in their duty to care for the flock. 
Because of their failure, much of the flock has been devoured by predators, and 
the survivors have been scattered across the earth.


This image represents a different perspective on what has happened to Ezekiel’s 
people. The nation is being punished not because the people have turned 
away from God, but because the self-serving practices of Israel’s kings have 
impoverished it. Their political decisions have left the country vulnerable to 
destruction. As they have remained preoccupied with themselves, their people 
have either fled as refugees or been forcibly deported.
●
●In response, God identifies himself as the true shepherd. In verses 11 and 
following, he says that as the shepherd, he will gather those who have been 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
130
displaced because of human conflict and care for those who are impoverished. 
This vision reshapes perspectives on God’s role.
●
●Finally, the vision assumes that these commitments to protect, feed, and heal 
the people will take political form. In verse 23, God says that he will appoint 
for them a single shepherd, his servant David, and this figure will provide for 
them and guide them. 
●
●Ezekiel assumes that God’s commitment to the well-being of the people 
must come to expression in leadership. Otherwise, it remains mere wishful 
thinking. This creates a tension. The prophet is keenly aware that leaders are 
fallible, yet he knows that leadership is needed. Instead of abandoning the 
notion of leadership, he envisions its renewal through a Davidic king, who 
will put the ideals of good shepherding into practice. 
Vision of the Dry Bones


There was no dawning of a new golden age in Ezekiel’s time. Any movement toward 
renewal fell short of the ideal. Yet Ezekiel pressed the question of what it would 
mean for a shattered and displaced people to be restored. In doing so, he provided 
what is probably the best-known part of his book: the vision of the dry bones. 


This scene appears in chapter 37, and it has captured people’s imaginations for 
centuries. The prophet has a vision in which he sees a valley filled with bones. 
Then God asks a question that initially seems ridiculous: “Can these bones 
live?” Obviously, the bones are lifeless. Yet God answers his own question by 
telling Ezekiel to prophesy to the bones. Ezekiel is to tell the dry bones that God 
will cause breath or spirit (Hebrew: ruach) to enter them and give them life.


Ezekiel hears a rattling sound as all the bones that are scattered over the ground 
come together to form skeletons. Then, the skeletons are then covered with flesh 
and skin. Finally, a surge of wind comes and fills them all with breath or spirit, 
so they can live. 


As strange as it is, in Ezekiel’s context, the vision addressed a serious problem: 
the profound sense of abandonment that was felt by people in exile. In verse 
11, Ezekiel is told that the dry bones symbolize the whole people of Israel, for 
whom the movement into exile felt like going to an early grave.

Lecture 19—Ezekiel on Abandonment and Homecoming 
131


This vision counters that sense of despair with the prospect that God will 
revitalize their lives and bring them back to their land. The prophet offers hope 
to a people who have lost hope, and that hope takes the form of national renewal. 
The prospect of the bones coming to life gave the exiles a way to imagine that 
they had a future, and that future included the promise of coming home. 
Homecoming


In chapter 40, we are told that 14 years have now passed since the temple was 
destroyed. Its ruins are like the dry bones, lying on the ground. But Ezekiel 
has a vision that transforms that perspective. He sees a man whose appearance 
is like shining bronze. The man has a measuring rod in his hand, and he takes 
Ezekiel on a tour of a restored sanctuary. Ezekiel depicts a sanctuary that is 
characterized by perfection. Earlier, the temple was a corrupt place of idolatry; 
now, it is pure and holy. The change conveys hope for a transformed future. 


Another key element in this section concerns the presence of God, who returns on 
his chariot in chapter 43 and whose glory fills the temple. This is a vision of God’s 
homecoming, and it is crucial for Ezekiel. It enables him to say that the threat of 
judgment is real yet is not final. What has happened does not close off the future.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Ezekiel communicates through surreal images, such as the movements of the 
throne chariot and the dry bones being restored to life. Why might people of 
his time have found such imagery engaging? Why might they have found it 
difficult to understand? 
2.	 In the first half of the book, Ezekiel portrays God as unrelenting in judgment. 
In the second half, he depicts God as a compassionate shepherd. What is the 
effect of including these contrasting images in the same book?

LECTURE 20
Jewish Identity and 
Rebuilding after Exile
 I 
n the year 539 B.C., the Babylonians were defeated by Cyrus II, king of 
Persia. The people who had been exiled from the region of Judah were simply 
one small group in the vast Persian Empire, but their lives and outlook were 
changed dramatically by Cyrus’s conquests. As we will see, some of them suddenly 
had the opportunity to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their society. But what did 
that mean in this new political context? And what did it mean for their identity as a 
people? In this lecture, we’ll look at the question of identity from two perspectives: 
Israel’s distinctiveness in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and its engagement with 
outsiders in Jonah.
Rebuilding the Temple


Earlier, we saw how the people of Israel’s identity was tied to worshipping the 
God who delivered their ancestors from slavery in Egypt. The prophetic writings 
reflected the ongoing struggle to reaffirm the uniqueness of that covenant with 
God, who is different from the gods of other nations. That same emphasis 
continues in Ezra and Nehemiah.


The book of Ezra begins with Cyrus issuing a decree allowing the people to 
return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. As we’ll see, throughout Ezra and 
Nehemiah, the Persians are pictured as rulers who play a supportive role in the 
renewal of Jewish life. This reflects a new way of conceiving Jewish identity—as 
something that can flourish under a foreign power. 


Once Cyrus’s decree has been issued, a group travels from Babylon to Jerusalem 
to start the rebuilding. The writer sees this group as the nucleus of the revitalized 
Jewish community in Jerusalem. 

Lecture 20—Jewish Identity and Rebuilding after Exile 
133


The groups starts by building a new altar on the foundation of the old one, 
offering sacrifices, and celebrating traditional holidays. The altar, the sacrifices, 
and the festivals all give this returning group a clear sense of identity. They are 
the bearers of Israel’s distinctive tradition. 


Things go well for a while, but then trouble begins, centering on the issue of 
identity. In chapter 4, a group of people who have been in the region for some 
time ask if they can join the newcomers in rebuilding the temple. This group 
consists of people whose ancestors were foreigners, having been brought into 
the region by the Assyrians many generations before. They, too, worship the 
God of Israel.


But the returning group doesn’t like the idea. They believe that the descendants 
of the foreign settlers continue to worship their own ancestral gods alongside 
the God of Israel. Do the two groups have enough in common to build a joint 
house of worship, or are the differences significant enough that they can’t work 
together and maintain their integrity? 


In Ezra 4, the returnees decide that building the temple is not a case where 
shared effort is possible. They see too many differences between their group and 
the others. Their refusal to cooperate prompts the other group to retaliate. If 
they can’t participate in the rebuilding, then they’ll try to stop it. Ultimately, the 
new temple isn’t completed until 515 B.C., more than two decades after Cyrus 
authorized the rebuilding.
Following the Law


Another factor that shapes a distinctive sense of identity is the Law of Moses. In 
Ezra 7, almost six decades have passed. The year is now 458 B.C., and again, a 
Persian monarch plays a positive role in renewing Jewish life. King Artaxerxes 
II authorizes Ezra, a Jewish scribe, to return to Jerusalem to teach people the 
Jewish law and to ensure that they obey both the Jewish law and the law of the 
Persian king. This reflects the Persians’ belief that the best way to run an empire 
was to give people a certain amount of local autonomy.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
134


Ezra’s role marks a shift from the pattern that was in place under the Babylonians. 
Before the exile, the people of Judah were governed by their own king and their 
own law. But when Jerusalem fell, the Davidic monarchy ended; what remained 
was a form of Jewish law, which will be implemented by a scribe. 


Ezra returns to Jerusalem, where he is confronted with an issue of law and 
identity. He is told that some of the men have married non-Jewish wives, and he 
is convinced that these marriages threaten the community’s ability to maintain 
its distinctive identity. 
●
●In chapter 9, Ezra tells God that he understands that mixed marriages are 
a violation of the law’s command to remain separate from other nations. 
He takes the draconian step of requiring people to divorce their foreign 
wives and send away their children. For him, maintaining a sense of 
identity requires breaking up families that seemed to compromise Israel’s 
distinctiveness.
●
●In Nehemiah 8 to 10, Ezra has people gather in an open plaza near one 
of the city gates, where he reads the law to them and where others can 
provide commentary. This scene contains many elements that characterize 
synagogue services of later generations, including the reading of the law and 
Ezra is seen as one of the great 
shapers of Jewish tradition; his 
reading of the law reflects many 
elements of synagogue services 
that are still practiced today.

Lecture 20—Jewish Identity and Rebuilding after Exile 
135
commentary. These same basic actions have been done repeatedly as people 
gather in their synagogues. Thus, many now remember Ezra as the one who 
defined Jewish identity around the centrality of Jewish law. 
●
●If we follow this theme into Nehemiah chapter 10, attention continues to 
focus on the community’s distinctiveness. Commitment to the law means 
not intermarrying with outsiders, observing the weekly Sabbath day, and 
paying for sacrifices to be offered in the temple. In the vast expanse of 
the Persian Empire, this community can say that it has an identity that is 
distinctively shaped by the Law of Moses. 
Rebuilding the Walls


Nehemiah, a Jewish man, is a servant of the Persian king. In chapter 1, he 
is in the Persian city of Susa, and the year is about 445 B.C. Some travelers 
tell Nehemiah that despite all the efforts at rebuilding, the walls of Jerusalem 
are still in a shambles, which Nehemiah regards as shameful. Walls were 
important for protection and to give a city a sense of grandeur. To live among 
ruined walls was a disgrace; thus, Nehemiah is determined to rebuild the walls 
of Jerusalem.


The Persian king authorizes the project and allows Nehemiah to lead another 
group back to Jerusalem to begin the work. But when he arrives in Jerusalem, 
conflict breaks out almost immediately. The officials who govern the Persian 
provinces surrounding Jerusalem are highly critical of the project, which they 
see as a dangerous act of self-assertion. They accuse Nehemiah of strengthening 
the city’s defenses to achieve greater political independence and more influence. 
They begin a campaign of harassment to stop the rebuilding. 


The efforts to halt the project involve the threat of attack against the workers, 
but Nehemiah establishes successful defenses, and by the end of chapter 6, the 
project is complete. To increase the population, the nearby towns and villages 
send 10 percent of their people to live in Jerusalem. Then, in chapter 12, there’s 
a festival to dedicate the walls. This well-defined and well-protected city now 
helps the community assert its own unique place within the empire.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
136
Engaging with Outsiders


The books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell the story of a people set apart from other 
nations, which can be a positive development. But the impulse to assert one’s 
distinctive identity can also create a community closed in on itself. The writer of 
Jonah recognizes this problem and emphasizes that the other side of the people 
of Israel’s identity is to engage with, and seek the well-being of, other nations.


The book of Jonah offers a humorous critique of people who are so self-absorbed 
that they seem oblivious to the needs of others. The main character in the book 
is the prophet Jonah, who lived centuries before the time of the rebuilding of 
Jerusalem under the Persians. But in this story, he mirrors the self-absorbed 
attitudes that the writer sees in people of the Persian period.


The story begins when God tells Jonah to go to the east, to prophesy against the 
wicked city of Nineveh, which had once been the capital of Assyria. Instead of 
obeying God, Jonah books a ticket on a boat going to Tarshish—in the opposite 
direction. 


God brings up a great storm that rocks the boat and throws all the sailors into a 
panic, but Jonah remains sound asleep. The sailors finally wake him up and tell 
him to pray, but Jonah doesn’t bother. Playing the martyr, he tells the sailors to 
throw him overboard to placate God. 


The sailors row the boat even harder, trying to save Jonah and themselves. But 
when the storm gets worse, they redirect their prayers to Jonah’s God and agree 
to throw the prophet into the sea. When they do so, the sea becomes calm, and 
the sailors offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Israel’s God. These former pagans 
actually prove to be much more devout than the prophet himself. 


Of course, God saves Jonah from drowning by sending a huge fish to swallow 
him up, and for three days, Jonah stays in the belly of the fish, giving thanks 
to God. All of chapter 2 is a prayer that exudes gratitude for God’s help in 
this time of need. But we’ll need to see how long Jonah actually persists in this 
attitude of thanks. 

Lecture 20—Jewish Identity and Rebuilding after Exile 
137


In chapter 3, the fish spits Jonah out onto the shore, and the prophet finally 
goes to Nineveh as commanded. He trudges into the middle of town and 
utters a single sentence: “Forty days more and Nineveh will be overthrown!” 
Immediately, everyone in the city of Nineveh repents. 


God responds positively and decides not to bring judgment against the city after 
all. But Jonah is outraged. He is grateful that God has been merciful to him but 
outraged that God would be merciful to others. He stomps out of the city in disgust. 


God is taken aback by Jonah’s narrow-mindedness. As the prophet sits outside 
Nineveh, hoping that God might change his mind and blast the city in 
judgment, God has a shady plant grow over Jonah’s head to shield him from the 
sun. Again, Jonah is grateful. But when the plant dies the next day, Jonah sits in 
the heat and returns to his martyr complex. 


Again, God is taken aback. He asks how Jonah can be so upset about a 
plant that gave him the comfort of a little shade, yet he refuses to let God be 
concerned about the welfare of an entire city full of people and animals. And 
that’s where the book ends: with a question that’s left for readers themselves to 
answer. Shouldn’t we seek the welfare of people everywhere, even those outside 
our own communities?

Questions to Consider
1.	 Ezra and Nehemiah focus on the temple, the law, and Jerusalem’s walls. Why 
did the writers see such an urgent need to reestablish each of these three 
things after the exile? 
2.	 The book of Jonah uses humor to critique the self-absorbed attitudes that 
have become a problem. Why draw out the aspect of humor instead of 
offering a direct criticism, as many prophetic writers did?

LECTURE 21
Esther, Daniel, and Life under 
Empire
 T 
he books of Esther and Daniel tell stories of life under the Persian 
Empire and the Hellenistic or Greek empires that followed. They show 
the schemes of the high and mighty being subverted and the vulnerable 
winning out in the end. At this time, the Jewish people were a small minority of 
these vast empires’ populations. Some of them had returned to Jerusalem, while 
others had stayed in Babylon and other regions ruled by the Persians. Wherever they 
were, they needed to make lives for themselves, with hope and encouragement, at a 
time when they were subject to the whims of those in power. The books of Esther 
and Daniel suggest how they did so.
Esther as Queen


The Persian rulers saw themselves as dignified and authoritative, but the Persian 
king in the story of Esther is not too bright. He repeatedly has other people 
tell him what to do, and his decisions are often ludicrous. The king’s primary 
adviser is the wicked Haman. 
●
●By way of contrast, a truly noble figure in the story is a Jewish man named 
Mordecai, who lives among the exiles under Persian rule. Mordecai has 
adopted his cousin Esther, who is an orphan, and raised her as his own 
daughter. He will foil the evil schemes of Haman and seek the welfare of his 
own people. 
●
●Esther herself is beautiful, and she rises from the status of commoner to become 
queen of the empire. She shows wisdom and courage and uses her powerful 
position to save those who are threatened. Esther’s story shows that even under 
domination by a foreign power, ordinary people may do great things. 


In the first scene, the king of Persia holds a great banquet and commands his 
wife, Vashti, to make an appearance to allow everyone to see her great beauty. 
But his wife refuses to come. The king’s advisers warn that Vashti’s refusal to 

Lecture 21—Esther, Daniel, and Life under Empire 
139
obey could turn into a national crisis, because women everywhere might start 
disobeying their husbands. To guard against this threat, the king banishes Vashti 
from his presence and decrees that men are to be masters in their own houses.


The king’s aides quickly begin searching for a new queen. One of the candidates 
is Esther, who keeps her Jewish identity a secret. When she is brought to the 
king, he immediately falls in love with her, and she becomes the queen. 


This extraordinary turn of events helps the king in ways he didn’t anticipate. 
We learn that the two of the king’s servants are planning to kill him, and 
Esther’s adoptive father, Mordecai, hears about the plot. He tells Esther about 
it, she warns the king, and the king has the would-be assassins put to death. 
Mordecai has saved the day, and his noble deed is written down in the royal 
records.
The plot of the book of Esther begins 
with a festive Persian banquet and ends 
with the Jewish festival of Purim; in 
between, the villain Haman devises one 
wicked scheme after another.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
140


The plot thickens when the king’s adviser, Haman, demands that everyone in 
the kingdom bow down to him, but Mordecai refuses to do so. Haman vows to 
retaliate by slaughtering not only Mordecai but all the Jews in the empire. To 
pick a day for this horrible deed, he rolls a set of dice (purim), which tell him to 
slaughter the Jews on the 13th day of the month of Adar. 


Haman convinces the king to go along with the proposed genocide, and 
a decree is issued, calling people to slaughter the Jews on the appointed day. 
When word gets out, Mordecai calls on Esther to try to influence the king to 
stop the slaughter.


In the final scene in the first half of the book, Esther invites both the king and 
Haman to a banquet. The king is so pleased with her that he offers to give 
Esther whatever she wants in return. She replies that she will make her request 
at a second banquet for the king and Haman the next day. Haman is delighted 
that he is included in all this with the king, but he’s still outraged by Mordecai’s 
refusal to show reverence toward him and plots to have him hanged. 
Esther’s Second Banquet


The second half of the book starts when the king learns for the first time 
that Mordecai once saved his life; in turn, the king determines that he must 
honor Mordecai. He consults Haman on this subject, who assumes the king is 
planning to honor him. Haman proposes having the honoree ride through the 
streets on the king’s horse, wearing royal robes. Delighted, the king tells Haman 
that he should do all this for Mordecai. Haman is furious, but he is trapped. 
Now he must honor Mordecai instead of demanding that Mordecai honor him. 


Next, Esther hosts her second banquet for the king and Haman. There, she reveals 
that she is Jewish and that Haman is plotting to kill her people. Haman panics 
and throws himself onto Esther’s couch to plead for his life. But when the king 
sees this, he thinks Haman is assaulting the queen, and he has Haman hanged.


Then, the king gives the Jews the right to defend themselves. Thus, when the 
enemies of the Jewish people are set to attack them on the day that Haman 
selected, the Jewish people strike first and win. Instead of disaster, there is 

Lecture 21—Esther, Daniel, and Life under Empire 
141
victory. The festival of Purim is established to commemorate the day when 
sorrow turned into gladness. 


One of the intriguing dimensions of this story is that God is never mentioned—
at least not in the Hebrew text. This reticence about God’s role recognizes the fact 
that for many people, the experience of God is more ambiguous than a lightning 
bolt in the sky. Given that ambiguity, they find it difficult to speak about divine 
activity with any certainty. Instead, Esther shows the value of human initiative.
The Fiery Furnace


The book of Daniel has two main parts. Chapters 1 to 6 tell stories about a 
Jewish sage named Daniel and his associates, who must deal with the whims of 
those who rule the empire. Chapters 7 to 12 recount visions of conflicts that 
will lead to the demise of the Babylonian, Persian, and Greek empires and the 
final coming of the kingdom of God. 


The stories in Daniel, like those in Esther, poke fun at the high and mighty. The 
rulers of the empire may think they impress others with their power and wealth, 
but these stories playfully undermine the kings’ pretentions through the use of 
humor. A good example is the story of the fiery furnace in chapter 3. 


In this story, the Babylonian king made a golden statue that stood 90 feet 
high and summoned all his administrators and officials to worship the 
statue. If they refused, they would be thrown into a furnace blazing with fire. 
Throughout these scenes, the writer uses long lists and repetition to show the 
extent of royal pomposity.


Three of Daniel’s friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to bow 
down to the golden statue and are thrown into the furnace. The fire is so hot 
that the guards who throw the men into the furnace are killed by the heat. But 
when the king looks in, he sees the three men walking around in the flames; 
with them is a mysterious fourth figure, who has a godlike appearance. 


The king calls out to the three men, who come out of the furnace, which they’ve 
survived unharmed. Then, the king says, “Praised be the God of Shadrach, 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
142
Meshach, and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants who 
trusted in him. They disobeyed the king’s command, and yielded up their 
bodies, rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.” The 
king’s pretensions have led him to humility and understanding.


On one level, this is an entertaining story of danger and deliverance that comes 
to a happy ending. But on another level, the story can make a serious point. 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego “yielded up their bodies” by disobeying an 
unjust decree of the state to obey the higher authority of God. 


The biblical story makes clear that the men hoped that God would preserve 
them through the struggle, but it also notes that they had no guarantee God 
would do. Before the happy ending, there is a serious threat. And resisting 
the threat with integrity and courage is what the episode challenges readers 
themselves to do. 
The Demise of Babylon


Chapter 5 of Daniel focuses on the demise of the Babylonians. In this colorful 
story, the king of Babylon is merrily eating and drinking at a banquet. In a 
moment of drunken arrogance, he has his servants bring out the bowls that the 
Babylonians had plundered from the temple in Jerusalem. He wants to drink 
from the bowls once devoted to Israel’s God. 


But then, the fingers of a hand appear, writing an ominous message on the wall. 
To decipher the message, the king sends for Daniel, who is a Jewish sage. Daniel 
explains that all the words portend the coming demise of the empire. 


The Babylonian king dies at the end of the chapter 5, and a new empire arises, 
which Daniel identifies with both the Medes and the Persians. But in chapter 
6, we receive intimations that this new empire also is transient. Here, the king 
decrees that people everywhere should worship no one but him for 30 days. It is 
another attempt to put the ruler in the place of God and to make the claims of 
the state absolute. Daniel refuses, and because of his disobedience, he’s thrown 
into a den of lions. By the end of the chapter, Daniel is saved, and it’s clear that 
no empire is absolute.

Lecture 21—Esther, Daniel, and Life under Empire 
143
The story of Daniel in the lions’ den 
has parallels to the fiery furnace 
story; the point of both is that no 
authority except God’s is absolute.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
144
Daniel’s Visions


Instead of stories of life in the imperial court, chapters 7 to 12 are accounts 
of visions that Daniel received. The visions include cryptic images that Daniel 
cannot understand, but angelic beings help him by disclosing the meaning. 


Chapter 7 is a good example of this pattern. Daniel has a vision of four 
beasts rising out of the sea that signify four successive empires: those of the 
Babylonians, the Medes, the Persians, and the Greeks. 


The point of the vision is this: History shows that empires rise, one after 
another, yet each one of them falls in due time. Readers are to resist persecution 
because it will not last forever. No human ruler is absolute. God’s purposes are 
just and will win out.


Daniel 7 pictures God coming for judgment, seated on his throne, surrounded 
by heavenly beings. It is a vision of accountability, giving assurance that the 
perpetrators of injustice cannot continue indefinitely. They, like all humans, are 
ultimately accountable to the higher authority of God.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The Hebrew version of the book of Esther does not explicitly mention God, 
though it alludes to a higher purpose behind the coincidences that take place 
in the story. Why might the writer have been so circumspect about the role 
of God? What kind of readers might find this circumspect approach helpful?
2.	 In contrast to Esther, Daniel explicitly refers to God working through events 
in history, including the rise and fall of empires. What kind of readers might 
find Daniel’s emphasis on God’s role to be helpful?

LECTURE 22
Resistance, Adaptation, and 
the Maccabees
 T 
he book of 1 Maccabees is another look at Israel’s life under foreign 
domination, this time, focusing on conflict under Greek rule in the 2nd 
century B.C. It’s a story that grapples with issues of cultural change, and 
it’s marked by the tension between resistance and adaptation. As political realities 
shift and cultural practices are transformed, when is it better to resist change and 
when is it better to adapt? In this lecture, we’ll consider several aspects of this 
question: the context and changes that generated the issue, the stories of those who 
the resisted changes, and the ongoing struggle for political independence. 
Context of 1 Maccabees


The book of 1 Maccabees starts with Alexander the Great, who ruled from 334 
to 323 B.C. In the short span of his life, he conquered the Persian Empire and 
dramatically altered the political landscape. With Alexander’s conquests, the 
region from Greece in the west to Egypt in the south and Pakistan in the east 
became part of the Greek Empire.


Up to this point, all the conquering powers—the Assyrians, Babylonians, and 
Persians—came from the east. But with the conqueror coming from the west, 
the language used for government and commerce changed to Greek. What’s 
more, the cities that Alexander founded and refurbished were centers for 
spreading Greek culture and would come to shape societies throughout the 
Mediterranean world.


After Alexander’s death, his empire was divided up among several successors. 
Eventually, the eastern Mediterranean was dominated by two rulers, who both 
founded Hellenistic dynasties: Seleucus I (who ruled Syria and regions to the 
north and east) and Ptolemy I (who ruled Egypt). In between the territory ruled 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
146
by these dynasties was Judea, where Jerusalem was located. In the 2nd century 
B.C., Judea was under Seleucid control. 


The villain of 1 Maccabees is Antiochus IV, also called Antiochus Epiphanes. 
He came to power in 175 B.C., and his western capital was the city of Antioch 
in Syria. The writer of 1 Maccabees warns that Antiochus is “a sinful root,” an 
opponent of faithful Jews.


Questions of adapting to or resisting Greek influence intensified as Antiochus 
asserted greater control over Jerusalem and the surrounding region. He sent his 
army to push back a growing threat from his Egyptian rivals, the Ptolemies. 
Then, he raided the temple in Jerusalem and established a fortress there, where 
troops were stationed to control opposition to Seleucid rule.


Things reached the breaking point when Antiochus tried to suppress Jewish 
practice and impose his own religious tradition by force. According to 1 Maccabees 
1, he banned the offering of Jewish sacrifices in the temple and prohibited the 
observance of the Sabbath and other holidays. Copies of the Jewish law were 
destroyed, and people who had their children circumcised were put to death. 
One flash point in the Jewish response 
to Greek culture was the establishment 
of a gymnasium in Jerusalem, where 
young athletes competed naked; to fit in 
at the gymnasium, some Jews had their 
circumcisions surgically reversed.

Lecture 22—Resistance, Adaptation, and the Maccabees 
147


Antiochus also turned the temple into a pagan sanctuary. He put up statues 
to various deities and set up altars where people could sacrifice swine and 
other animals that Jews considered unclean. The crowning touch came in mid-
December of 167 B.C., when Antiochus put what the writer calls a “desolating 
sacrilege” in the temple. That sacrilege was a pagan altar that was placed on top 
of the Jewish altar of burnt offering. Other sources add that Antiochus dedicated 
the temple to Zeus, whom the Seleucids worshipped as the god of heaven. 
Resisting Change


The story of resistance to these changes begins in chapter 2. It was a movement 
initiated by a man named Mattathias, who came from a family of priests. One 
of his sons was named Judah, and his nickname was Maccabee, which means 
“the hammer.” Judah played such an important role that his nickname is used 
for the resistance movement as a whole, which is called the Maccabean revolt. 


The incident that sparked the revolt took place in Modein, northwest of Jerusalem. 
An officer of the king came there to induce Mattathias and others to adopt non-
Jewish practices and to offer a pagan sacrifice. To sweeten the deal, the officer 
promised to give them gold and silver and to grant them the title “friends of the 
king.” But Mattathias insisted that he would live by the covenant of his ancestors.


At that moment, another Jewish man stepped forward to show that he was 
willing to adapt to the new situation and offer the sacrifice demanded by the 
king. But Mattathias was outraged at what he considered apostasy. He killed 
both the Jewish man and the king’s officer and fled to the desert. From there, he 
assembled a fighting force and engaged in guerilla warfare against the Seleucids 
and their supporters. 


With the death of Mattathias, his son Judah Maccabee became the leader. Judah 
transformed the resistance movement into a large-scale military campaign that 
resisted Seleucid oppression and reestablished Jewish control of the temple in 
Jerusalem.


In the middle of chapter 4, Judah and his men returned to Jerusalem, found the 
temple in a shambles, and began the process of rebuilding. In mid-December of 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
148
164 B.C., three years after Judah’s return, the restored sanctuary was ready for 
dedication. The festivities lasted for eight days, and the celebration was known 
as Hanukkah (Hebrew: “dedication”). In later times, people began telling 
the story of the lamp oil that miraculously lasted for eight days on the first 
Hanukkah, but that’s not part of the narrative in 1 Maccabees.


The Maccabean resistance movement eventually forced the Seleucids to halt 
their attempt at suppressing Jewish practice. In chapter 5, the Maccabees 
achieve a series of military victories that extend their influence over much of 
the country. Then, in chapter 6, the success of the Maccabees is contrasted 
with the failure of Antiochus, who tries to plunder other cities but cannot do 
so. According to the author of 1 Maccabees, Antiochus becomes sick with 
disappointment and dies full of regret. His successors agree to lift the ban on 
Jewish religious practice in the interests of peace.
Judah Maccabee would earn his 
nickname by “hammering” the 
Seleucid armies with his victories 
on the battlefield.

Lecture 22—Resistance, Adaptation, and the Maccabees 
149
Adapting to Change


The narrative in 1 Maccabees doesn’t stop at this high point. Instead, it 
continues with an increasingly complex story. We find the Maccabees fighting 
not only for religious freedom but for political independence. And once again, 
we find a tension between resistance and adaptation. The battle scenes show the 
Maccabees resisting Seleucid rule, but to achieve independence, they must also 
adapt to changing political realities. This raises interesting questions about the 
points at which adaptation either advances the Maccabean cause or requires a 
compromise of their principles. 


One point of adaptation is Judah Maccabee’s willingness to establish an alliance 
with Rome. In chapter 8, the writer provides an idealized account of Roman 
expansion in this period. And it’s important to note that Rome shared a religious 
and cultural outlook quite similar to that of Greece. Under Rome, the patterns 
of Greek influence continue.


Yet here, Judah Maccabee makes a pragmatic decision: to gain greater political 
independence from the Seleucids, he becomes an ally of the Romans. His 
movement begins by resisting the policies of the government based in Syria, but 
it continues with the support of a government based in Rome. He’s fighting to 
be free from foreign domination, but he does so by enlisting foreign help. 


We can certainly interpret this as a practical political move, but it raises 
questions for reflection. To what extent does Judah succeed in maintaining 
his people’s distinctive way of life through resistance, and to what extent does 
adapting mean giving up that distinctiveness? Does he achieve the goals that 
inspired him at first, or does he lose sight of his original vision? 


These questions persist after the death of Judah, who is killed on the battlefield, 
and leadership goes to his brother Jonathan. Now the situation involves politics 
and priesthood. At this point, the Seleucids are going through their own internal 
power struggle. There are two rivals for the Seleucid throne, and one of them 
decides to strengthen his position by gaining the support of Jonathan and the 
Maccabean rebels.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
150


This rival says that if Jonathan will support his bid for the Seleucid throne, 
he will make Jonathan high priest of the Jewish nation. The Jews will still be 
subject to the Seleucids, but serving as high priest will give Jonathan greater 
social status. 


This offer fits Greek practice, in which it was common for a ruler to honor 
someone by appointing him to the priesthood. But in Jewish tradition, the high 
priest had to come from a specific Jewish family who had the correct credentials. 
Despite the fact that he came from a family of ordinary priests and that the offer 
violated Jewish tradition, Jonathan took the office anyway. In his eyes, doing 
so was a necessary adaptation that advanced his own political career and the 
interests of the Maccabean movement.


The final step came when leadership passed to yet another of Judah Maccabees’s 
brothers, Simon, who finally brought the resistance movement to its goal of greater 
political independence. The year was 142 B.C., and Simon had strengthened his 
political and military position enough to ask that his region of Judea might be 
freed from taxation by the Seleucids. By this point, the Seleucids had grown tired 
of trying to maintain their control over Judea, and they agreed. The burden of 
foreign taxation was lifted, the foreign troops that had been stationed in Jerusalem 
were removed, and a new era of Jewish independence began. 
Summing Up the Maccabees


The Maccabean movement began with resistance to foreign influence, especially 
the Seleucids’ efforts to suppress Jewish practice. But it led to the formation of a 
Jewish kingdom that seemed to follow Greek models in a figure who combined 
the priestly, political, and military roles. And it maintained its position through 
an alliance with Rome. Did the adaptations of the Maccabees help them 
preserve the distinctive identity of the Jewish people, or was something essential 
lost in the process?


In the decades that followed, the Maccabean kingdom was plagued by infighting. 
To stabilize the region, the Romans took control. In 63 B.C., the Roman general 
Pompey captured Jerusalem and brought Judea under Roman domination. 

Lecture 22—Resistance, Adaptation, and the Maccabees 
151


Eventually, the Romans appointed a local warlord named Herod to govern Judea, 
and he transformed it into a Roman province. He renamed cities after Augustus, 
renovated the Jerusalem temple, and built a fortress next to the temple. In that 
fortress, in the heart of Jerusalem, Roman troops were stationed. That would be 
the state of things in the late 1st century B.C., when the story of Jesus begins.

Questions to Consider
1.	 To what extent did the Maccabees succeed in resisting Greek culture and 
maintaining a distinctive Jewish way of life? To what extent did they end up 
adapting to Greek culture? Was adaptation a practical way of achieving the 
movement’s goals, or did it lead to the loss of the movement’s original vision?
2.	 In what ways are the Maccabees similar to the military and political leaders 
we encountered earlier in the course? In what ways are the Maccabees 
different from those earlier leaders?

LECTURE 23
Jesus as Messiah in Mark
 T 
he New Testament contains multiple portraits of Jesus, and when taken 
together, these texts create a kind of dialogue about the significance of 
his work. The dialogue begins as we read the first four books in the New 
Testament, which are called gospels. Each gospel is a narrative about the life of 
Jesus, and each gospel has its own unique elements. Instead of blending them into 
a single story, the New Testament places them side by side, allowing the different 
perspectives to stand in creative tension with one another. The four gospels are 
called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; in this lecture, we’ll begin to explore how 
these gospels work as narratives with the Gospel of Mark.
Mark’s Introduction


The Gospel of Mark is the shortest of the gospels and was probably the first 
to be written. Jesus lived in the early decades of the 1st century A.D. He was 
crucified around the year 30, and in the decades that followed, the stories about 
him were handed down by word of mouth. But around the year 70, some of 
this material was written down in Mark’s gospel. 


Mark’s introduction sets high expectations for readers. The opening line says, 
“The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.” The Greek word 
for “gospel” is euangelion, which literally means “good news.” In other ancient 
literature, the word could be used for the good news of a victory in battle. In 
Mark, it introduces a narrative in which Jesus overcomes the forces of evil in the 
world and announces the arrival of God’s kingdom.


Mark refers to Jesus as Christ. The Greek word is christos, which means “anointed 
one,” and the Hebrew equivalent is “messiah.” You may recall that when they 
assumed royal office, King Saul and King David were anointed. Referring to 
Jesus as Christ or Anointed One suggests that he, too, is a king. 

Lecture 23—Jesus as Messiah in Mark 
153
Perhaps some of the 
most popular scenes in 
Western art are those of 
Jesus’s birth, typically 
showing the infant in 
the manger with his 
parents on either side.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
154


That same idea is conveyed by the expression Son of God. In the story of King 
David (2. Sam. 7), God promised that David’s descendants would inherit his 
throne and establish a kingdom that endured forever. The passage said that 
God would be a father to David’s successor, and it referred to his successor as 
God’s son. Thus, the expression Son of God has royal connotations. It raises high 
expectations about the kingly figure who is coming. 


The sense of expectation continues in the narrative itself, where an unusual 
messenger prepares for the king’s arrival. The messenger is a peculiar figure 
named John the baptizer, whom ancient readers would have realized resembled 
Elijah. 
●
●As you recall, in the book of Kings, Elijah never died. Rather, he was swept 
away to heaven on a fiery chariot and a whirlwind. The prophetic book of 
Malachi said that Elijah would return before the time of God’s judgment. 
●
●Mark quotes from Malachi in the opening scene of his gospel, saying, “See, 
I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.” The 
idea is that through John the baptizer, the hopes expressed by the ancient 
prophetic writings are being realized. 
●
●The book of Malachi said that Elijah would bring a message of reconciliation, 
and the opening scenes in Mark vary the theme by saying that John 
announced “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.” Of course, 
baptism is a ritual washing, and here, it is said to reflect repentance, a turning 
away from sin. 


Mark’s gospel includes no account of Jesus’s birth or childhood. Instead, Jesus 
simply appears when he comes to John for baptism. Then, the narrative takes 
a surprising turn. John has spoken about baptism as a sign of repentance, 
but Mark portrays it mainly as a moment of divine revelation. When Jesus is 
baptized, the sky is torn apart and a voice from heaven declares that Jesus is 
God’s beloved Son. This revelation of Jesus as God’s Son inaugurates a period 
of action in which Jesus engages the forces that hold people captive in sin and 
becomes an agent of deliverance.

Lecture 23—Jesus as Messiah in Mark 
155
The Kingdom of God


According to Mark, Jesus’s public activity begins with the announcement: “The 
time is fulfilled. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the 
good news.” At this point, what Jesus means by the kingdom is not defined, and 
when he refers to it, he raises more questions than he answers. 


As you’ll recall, the kingdom of Israel was united under Saul, David, and 
Solomon. But that unity was shattered with the formation of the northern 
and southern kingdoms. Both kingdoms were then devastated by waves of 
conquest. In time, the Maccabees revolted and established an independent 
kingdom; it lasted for some decades but then fell to the Romans. In political 
terms, the hope of a reestablished kingdom in the Promised Land had not 
been fully realized.


Alongside these political realities was hope for something of another order, 
a time when God would establish a kingdom of peace and harmony. Isaiah’s 
vision was of a world in which nations would turn their swords into plowshares. 
Daniel looked for the time when oppressive empires would end. What did Jesus 
mean with his message about the kingdom of God?


After Jesus announces the coming of the kingdom, he acts as a commander 
summoning his troops. As he walks beside the Sea of Galilee, he sees fishermen 
and commands them to follow him. Surprisingly, they do; thus, the initial 
impression is that God’s kingdom begins to come about as people respond 
favorably to Jesus’s word.


The plot intensifies as Jesus launches an assault against what are depicted as the 
powers of evil. For example, he encounters a man possessed by an unclean spirit or 
demon. In the process of healing, this spirit cries out, “What have you to do with 
us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?” From Mark’s perspective, 
the answer is yes, that is what Jesus has come to do. We get the sense that Jesus is 
bringing about God’s kingdom by defeating the powers that diminish life. 


We can see a process of redefinition taking place in these scenes. The word 
kingdom typically referred to the political order, but in Mark’s gospel, the 
impression is that God reigns where life is made whole. A sign of the kingdom 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
156
is healing, and that impression deepens as the story continues and Jesus heals 
other people. Mark shows the kingdom coming where life is restored.


The next chapter expands that idea to include the healing of relationships. 
Here, instead of healing a paralyzed man, Jesus says to him, “Your sins 
are forgiven.” This categorical announcement implies the restoration of 
relationship with God.
Jesus’s Parables


Some of Jesus’s most memorable teachings come through his parables, which are 
short stories that contain lessons and figurative sayings. What’s intriguing about 
the parables in Mark is that they initially seem so ordinary, yet they repeatedly 
baffle Jesus’s listeners and emphasize the mystery of God’s kingdom. 


For example, chapter 4 begins with Jesus telling a crowd of people a parable 
about a farmer who is planting grain by hand. The farmer takes handfuls of 
grain and scatters it on the ground, but in doing so, he seems careless. 
●
●Most of the seed falls where it would not grow—on rocks or among the 
weeds. Only in the end does Jesus mention that some seed falls on good soil, 
where it produces a bountiful crop. 
●
●Jesus’s listeners are baffled by the parable, but he explains that it is about 
the mystery of God’s kingdom. The explanation identifies the seed with 
the message about the kingdom. And the images of the birds, the heat of 
the sun, and the thorns represent hostile powers that prevent the message 
from bearing fruit. All those forces prevent people from receiving Jesus’s 
message and living it out. Thus, in one sense, the mystery is that despite the 
challenges, some people do receive the message. 
●
●In a wider literary sense, the message is that Jesus is like the farmer. We see 
him spreading the message about the kingdom—even where it is unlikely to 
grow—and showing people what the message means by offering healing and 
forgiveness.
●
●The mystery is that he persists in planting even when there seems to be little 
promise of a return. The parable sets a pattern and intimates that what is 
true for Jesus will also be true for those who follow him. 

Lecture 23—Jesus as Messiah in Mark 
157
Suffering and Service


Chapters 8 to 10 of Mark focus on themes of suffering and service. In chapter 
8, Jesus asks his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” They report that 
Jesus is rumored to be a new John the Baptist or, perhaps, Elijah or some other 
prophet. But when Jesus asks, “But who do you say that I am?” the disciple 
named Peter says, “You are the Christ” (God’s anointed king), identifying Jesus 
in royal terms. 


At this pivotal moment, Jesus does not reject the title but, instead, redefines it in 
terms of suffering and service. 
●
●In Mark 8:31, Jesus makes the first direct reference to the suffering he will 
experience at the end of his ministry. With evident knowledge of the future, 
he says that he must suffer and be rejected by the Jewish leaders. Three 
times in Mark’s gospel, Jesus tells us that he will be killed and, after three 
days, rise again. 
●
●In the movement of the narrative, these statements about his coming death 
and resurrection form the way in which readers are to understand what it 
means to call Jesus the royal Messiah. He follows a path that moves from 
death into life. 
●
●Jesus’s words about suffering stun his disciples, who have come to think 
of him as the Messiah. Yet Jesus insists that suffering and service will 
characterize his course of action and set the direction for those who follow 
him. He says, “If any want to follow me, let them deny themselves and take 
up their cross and follow me.” 


The positive dimension becomes more prominent as Jesus defines what it 
means to follow him in terms of service. In chapter 10, where he speaks of 
his suffering, death, and resurrection for a third time, he announces, “whoever 
wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to 
be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man did not come to be 
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

Questions to Consider
1.	 The lecture notes places where Mark’s gospel recalls aspects of the Old 
Testament writings, including traditions about David and Elijah and the 
words of such prophets as Isaiah and Malachi. How does the story of Jesus 
seem to realize the hopes associated with those Old Testament writings? How 
does his story seem to alter those expectations?
2.	 Parables are a form of teaching that uses imagery. Why might Jesus have 
spoken about the kingdom in parables instead of providing a direct definition 
of what the kingdom is?

LECTURE 24
Mark on the Crucifixion and 
Resurrection
 T 
he Gospel of Mark introduces Jesus and his message about the kingdom 
of God. For Jews of the time, hope for the kingdom usually meant a 
golden age of peace. But in Mark’s narrative, the kingdom is redefined 
in terms of healing and forgiveness, suffering and service. In the second part of 
Mark’s gospel, the process of redefining the kingdom continues. Jesus is given royal 
titles, but the opposition to his purported kingship ultimately intensifies and leads 
to his crucifixion. As a writer, the author of Mark must grapple with this apparent 
contradiction between kingship and crucifixion, between power and weakness. His 
challenge is to narrate a story in which crucifixion does not negate Jesus’s kingship 
but defines it. 
Jesus in Jerusalem


In Mark 11, the setting shifts from Galilee in the north to the city of Jerusalem 
in the south. Jesus approaches the city in a dramatic royal procession, riding 
a colt. The crowd in Mark’s gospel makes the royal theme explicit, saying, 
“Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the 
coming kingdom of our ancestor David!” From Mark’s perspective, Jesus is the 
coming king. But how will his kingship be carried out? 


As the story progresses, we find that the positive reception by the crowd is 
matched by a negative reaction from Jewish authorities. A pivotal moment 
comes when Jesus makes a prophetic critique of the central religious institution 
of the time: the Jerusalem temple. 
●
●In the courtyard in front of the temple were merchants, selling animals to 
pilgrims for sacrifice, and moneychangers to exchange travelers’ foreign coins. 
●
●Jesus chases both the merchants and their customers out of the temple and 
overturns the tables of the moneychangers. He announces that the temple is 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
160
not serving the purpose for which it was built—to be, in an echo of Isaiah, 
“a house of prayer for all nations.”


In response, the Jewish leaders intensify their opposition, trying a political tactic 
in chapter 12. They ask Jesus whether or not it is right to pay taxes to Caesar. 
●
●For many people, the taxes demanded by Rome represented foreign 
domination, and paying the tax meant subservience to Rome. These opponents 
put Jesus in an awkward position. If he supports the tax, he will alienate himself 
from the public. If he rejects it, he will get in trouble with Rome.
●
●Ultimately, Jesus answers, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and 
to God the things that are God’s.” This answer makes a place for Roman 
authority, while affirming a higher loyalty to God. 
The Last Supper


Mark 14 tells of Jesus’s Last Supper with his disciples and his arrest, developing 
the narrative tension that has been building. On the one hand, opposition to 
Jesus continues, and it now infiltrates Jesus’s inner circle. On the other hand, 
Jesus remains committed to the message of God’s kingdom, which brings 
deliverance and is enacted through suffering and service. 


The chapter begins with opposition. The Jewish leaders are looking for a way 
to arrest Jesus but want to do so secretly because he remains popular with the 
crowd. Soon, we learn that one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, agrees to betray 
Jesus to the authorities. When Jesus gathers for a meal with his disciples in the 
evening, he discloses that one of them will betray him. 


Readers have struggled to understand what prompts Judas to turn against Jesus, 
but significantly, Mark does not explain the betrayal. He simply accepts it as a 
given. And the growing opposition against Jesus creates the context in which 
Jesus must act. For Mark, the question is not what causes Judas to betray Jesus 
but, rather: Given the growing opposition—which now infiltrates Jesus’s own 
circle—how will Jesus respond?


At the meal in Mark’s gospel, Jesus invokes the theme of Passover to define his 
own course of action. 

Lecture 24—Mark on the Crucifixion and Resurrection 
161
●
●Jesus blesses the bread and says, “Take. This is my body.” The bread is a visible 
reminder of God’s gift of deliverance in the Exodus. And by identifying the 
bread with his body, Jesus anticipates that God’s deliverance now will come 
through Jesus’s gift of his own body. 
●
●Then, he takes a cup of wine, gives thanks, and says, “This is my blood of 
the covenant, which is poured out for many.” In the Passover story, the blood 
on the doors was a sign of belonging to God. At the meal, Jesus makes the 
shedding of his blood an act that is done for others. It is an act of self-giving 
that brings others into God’s covenant. 
●
●Thus, in Mark, the backdrop of the meal is betrayal, which expresses 
alienation. But Jesus responds by reasserting that his intent is to create 
relationship and life together under God’s covenant.


Later in the chapter, the theme of opposition returns as Jesus goes to pray at a 
place called Gethsemane. Soon, a group armed with swords and clubs appears, 
and in a moment of pointed irony, Judas steps forward and betrays Jesus by 
kissing him. With this ironic turn, Jesus is taken away to be tried.
Jesus’s Trial


In Mark 14:53, Jesus is taken to a gathering of Jewish leaders for a highly 
irregular trial. (The trial takes place at night; it’s on a holiday; and the outcome 
is determined before the trial even begins—the leaders want Jesus put to death.) 
The problem is that Jewish law required convincing testimony from two or 
three witnesses, and that proved difficult to get.


Eventually, the high priest questions Jesus about his purported kingship. He 
asks, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” (meaning God). Jesus 
affirms that he is, and from Mark’s perspective, that is profoundly true. But 
throughout the gospel, Mark has shown Jesus redefining his role in terms of 
healing and forgiveness, of suffering and service. And his opponents fail to see 
that. They can only hear Jesus’s words as blasphemy and now condemn him. 


This brings us to Jesus’s encounter with Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. As 
governor, Pilate was the most powerful man in the province. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
162
●
●The Jewish leaders bring Jesus to Pilate because he has the authority to 
pronounce the sentence and carry out the execution. Pilate’s perspective is 
political. He wants to know whether Jesus claims to be the king of the Jews, 
because for Pilate, someone with royal aspirations would presumably foment 
insurrection. Despite the accusations, Pilate finds no convincing evidence 
that Jesus poses a threat to Roman rule. 
●
●Because it’s a holiday, Pilate offers to release Jesus, but his tactic backfires. 
The people demand that he release another prisoner and crucify Jesus. 
●
●Pilate repeats that he can find no grounds for convicting Jesus, but in the 
end, he capitulates. The most powerful man in the province pronounces the 
death sentence, knowing that he has no legitimate grounds for doing so. 
The Crucifixion


The crucifixion brings the conflicting claims about Jesus to their narrative 
climax. For the opponents, the crucifixion shows that Jesus’s kingship is a 
sham. The would-be Messiah is now condemned and becomes the object of 
ridicule. But for Mark, the crucifixion shows that Jesus’s kingship is authentic; 
it completes the redefinition of kingship in terms of self-giving and suffering.


After Pilate pronounces the death sentence, he has Jesus whipped. The Roman 
soldiers then stage a mock coronation before taking Jesus to the place of 
execution. Bystanders there ridicule Jesus by repeating the accusations that were 
made at the trial and about his claim to be the Messiah. As a healer, he may have 
saved others, but now he’s unable to save himself. They challenge this would-be 
Messiah to come down from the cross, so they might believe in him. 


The pivotal moment comes when Jesus cries out, “My God, my God, why have 
you forsaken me?” These words of anguish go to the heart of the matter: Does 
Jesus’s suffering negate any notion of his kingship, or does it define the character 
of his kingship? From Mark’s perspective, the words are deeply consistent with 
the path Jesus has chosen. The words are actually a quotation from Psalm 22, 
which expresses the depth of human suffering; by voicing the psalm, Jesus shows 
that he shares fully in that experience of suffering. 

Lecture 24—Mark on the Crucifixion and Resurrection 
163
In one sense, Jesus’s death can 
be seen as a pointless tragedy—
something brought about by the 
political maneuvering of those in 
power; yet his death has also been 
seen as an action that carries out 
the will of God.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
164


In what follows, there are also direct narrative responses to the taunts about the 
temple and kingship. Mark says that at the moment Jesus dies, the curtain in 
the temple (separating the inner and outer parts of the sanctuary) is torn apart. 
●
●This gives divine affirmation to Jesus’s criticism of the temple. It signifies 
that in the crucifixion, the barrier separating God from human beings is 
removed. If the temple curtain concealed the place of God’s presence, the 
crucifixion reveals it. It reveals that God is present in the place of suffering.
●
●For Mark, this is a miraculous action, not something that bystanders at the 
crucifixion would have observed, and it gives a kind of surreal quality to the 
scene. But within Mark’s narrative, the tearing of the curtain provides divine 
commentary on the death of Jesus. 


God’s presence at the crucifixion is affirmed by the Roman guard who stands 
by the cross. As the guard looks at the dying Jesus, he says “Truly this man was 
the Son of God.” Where the opponents assumed that Jesus’s death would put 
an end to such claims, the guard insists that his death bears out their truth. In 
Mark, what it means to be the Son of God is defined by Jesus’s willingness to 
enter fully into the reality of human suffering. 
The Resurrection


Mark’s account of Jesus’s resurrection is both brief and filled with mystery. At 
the end of chapter 15, Mark says that Jesus died on the day before the Sabbath. 
As evening came, his body was placed in a tomb, with a large stone over the 
entrance. 


In chapter 16, three women come to the tomb on the day after the Sabbath 
to anoint Jesus’s body. But when they arrive, they find the tomb open, and a 
young man sitting inside. He says that Jesus has been raised and is going ahead 
of them to Galilee, where they will see him. Terrified, the women run away and 
say nothing. 


That is where Mark’s Gospel ends, on this unsettling note of fear and silence. 
Many modern readers find this abrupt ending unsatisfying. Mark does not 
actually describe the risen Jesus appearing to the disciples. What the women 
have is the promise of seeing him. And they will find out if the promise is true

only by embarking on a journey to Galilee. The question is whether they will do 
so or whether fear and silence will persist.

LECTURE 25
The Dynamics of Forgiveness 
in Matthew
 I 
n the Gospel of Matthew, a central concern is one’s way of life. The 
narrative was written for Christian readers who lived perhaps 50 years after 
the crucifixion of Jesus. During those years, the followers of Jesus formed 
communities that were located in various cities in the Roman Empire. As those 
communities handed on the message of Jesus from one generation to the next, they 
had to ask how it would shape their way of life. In this lecture, we’ll explore that 
question by focusing on passages that are distinctive of Matthew’s gospel; specifically, 
we’ll take up four elements: trust, transformation, community, and redemption. 
Trust


Matthew introduces Jesus by tracing his ancestry from Abraham to King David, 
then to the exile in Babylon and through the generations that followed. That 
genealogy gives us the sense that the whole sweep of Israel’s story is moving 
toward the moment when Jesus appears as Israel’s Messiah. But then a crisis 
threatens to derail the process. 


The situation is that Jesus’s mother, Mary, is engaged to a man named Joseph. 
She is pregnant, and Joseph knows that he is not the father. He decides to end 
the relationship quietly to avoid a public scandal. But Joseph has a dream, in 
which an angel tells him that the child has been conceived through the Holy 
Spirit. And the angel says this fulfills what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: 
“Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name 
Immanuel” (“God with us”). 
●
●In later Christian tradition, the idea that Jesus was conceived by the Holy 
Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary became an official teaching of many 
churches, and in some cases, it has been the focus of theological debate. 
But in Matthew’s narrative, the words of Isaiah identify Jesus as the child 
through whom God’s purposes will be worked out. 

Lecture 25—The Dynamics of Forgiveness in Matthew 
167
●
●In Isaiah, the promise of Immanuel meant deliverance from military invasion. 
But in Joseph’s dream that changes, so that Immanuel is to bring deliverance 
from human sin. He is a Messiah of a spiritual kingdom, not a kingdom of 
mortals on earth. Everything in Joseph’s dream seems counterintuitive, yet 
Joseph responds to it with trust. And he proceeds with the marriage, despite 
the threat of scandal. 


With that, the story moves forward to the time of Jesus’s birth in Bethlehem. 
But then the story takes a surprising turn, because the first people to arrive to 
see the child are foreigners with a rather dubious pedigree—magi (astrologers). 
They come from the east and are, in a sense, pagans and outsiders to the 
tradition of Israel. 
●
●The magi are led to follow a star, which takes them initially to Jerusalem. In 
a remarkable display of trust, they go to the court of King Herod the Great 
and ask where to find the child, whom they somehow know has been born 
king of the Jews. Herod gathers the Jewish leaders, who have a ready answer. 
The Scriptures say the king will come from Bethlehem. 
●
●Interestingly, the insiders who have the answer remain in Jerusalem, while 
the outsiders who ask the question travel on to Bethlehem. There, they 
worship the child and offer him their gifts. Thus, even as Matthew affirms 
the distinctive Davidic tradition by tying the story of Jesus to Bethlehem, 
the story emphasizes the importance of outsiders by bringing in the magi. 


This opening section of Matthew then jumps forward in time to an account 
of John the Baptist and the baptism of Jesus that is similar to that of Mark’s 
gospel. Matthew also includes an episode that appears in Mark in which Jesus is 
tested by the devil, but Matthew’s version is much more detailed. This period of 
testing is often called the temptation of Christ. In Matthew’s gospel, Jesus must 
trust that the way forward means resisting the allure of evil. 
Transformation


The next major section of the gospel centers on the teaching of Jesus. In chapters 
5 through 7, we come to the Sermon on the Mount, which is a hallmark of 
Matthew’s gospel. It’s here that we find the Golden Rule and other good, 
practical advice. Interestingly, however, much of the Sermon on the Mount

his own version of the New 
Testament, omitting all 
references to miracles and 
giving the Sermon on the 
Mount a prominent place.

Lecture 25—The Dynamics of Forgiveness in Matthew 
169
is also unconventional. It goes beyond familiar forms of moral instruction to 
transform the way people see themselves and their world. 


The sermon opens with a series of statements called beatitudes, each beginning 
with the word “blessed”: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom 
of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.” There are 
nine of these statements in all. 
●
●The beatitudes bring together situations that seem incompatible. The word 
blessed communicates a sense of well-being, yet those who are poor in spirit 
or are grieving or meek would not feel well-being. 
●
●The beatitudes alter the way people see their current situations by combining 
realism with hope. They are realistic in that they name the emptiness, grief, 
and vulnerability. They recognize that such experiences are real and cannot 
be dismissed. Yet they insist that even as people face emptiness and loss, they 
can see themselves as recipients of God’s favor. Despite the vulnerability, 
they are people who are valued by God. 
●
●The beatitudes add hope by insisting that the emptiness and loss of the 
present need not define the future. Jesus says that the hope of experiencing 
God’s kingdom remains. And as he continues, he extends the list to include 
a word of blessing for those who are merciful, are pure in heart, make peace, 
and do what is right in the face of opposition. For Jesus, those are the things 
of abiding value.


The Sermon on the Mount continues transforming the perspectives of readers 
by adopting a more confrontational tone in the middle of chapter 5. Here, Jesus 
contrasts traditional standards of behavior with his own more radical view. 
●
●He begins by quoting from the Ten Commandments, starting with “You 
shall not kill.” The assumption is that someone who commits murder will 
face judgment. But Jesus radicalizes the idea by focusing on anger, which is 
the underlying cause of the killing. He says that even if you are only angry 
with someone else, you will face judgment. 
●
●He does the same thing with the commandment “You shall not commit 
adultery.” In an ordinary sense, this means that you are not to have an 
extramarital affair. But again, Jesus goes to the underlying cause. He says that 
if you even look at another person with lust, you are committing adultery in 
your heart. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
170
●
●These radical statements are designed to startle people out of their complacency. 
Jesus calls people beyond simple adherence to the traditional code of behavior. 
His goal is nothing less than heartfelt adherence to the will of God.


This pattern culminates at the end of chapter 5, where Jesus observes that the 
traditional view was that people should love their neighbors and hate their 
enemies. But Jesus says, “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute 
you.” He points out that anyone can show love for those who love them in 
return. But when you limit your love to insiders, nothing changes. For Jesus, love 
is transformative. Instead of reinforcing the boundaries, love overcomes them. 
Community


Chapter 18 of Matthew focuses on community life. This section would have 
been especially important for the Christian communities that formed in the 
decades after the crucifixion of Jesus who faced ongoing questions about how 
to live together.


Jesus begins with practical advice about conflict. He describes a situation of 
working out conflict privately, with two or three other people, or with the wider 
community. If in the end, the person with whom you are in conflict is utterly 
intractable, then the community should treat that person as an outsider. 


Peter, one of Jesus’s disciples, wants to know how often he needs to forgive 
someone who repeatedly sins against him. Setting himself what he thinks is 
a high bar, he asks whether forgiving someone up to 7 times is enough. But 
Jesus says that one should forgive not merely 7 times but 77 times (or, in some 
translations, 70 times 7). To make sure people get the point, he reinforces it 
with a parable about a slave who owes a large sum of money to a king. 
●
●This parable adds perspective to community life. People are not only to see 
themselves as those who are owed something by others, but they are to see 
themselves as those whose own debts have been forgiven. 
●
●In community, they must see themselves first as the recipients of forgiveness, 
and in that light, they are to deal with others in the same way.

Lecture 25—The Dynamics of Forgiveness in Matthew 
171
Redemption


In Matthew, the account of Jesus’s death and resurrection begins in chapter 21 
with the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem, being welcomed by the crowds, and 
driving the merchants out of the temple. It continues with Jesus eating a final 
meal with his disciples and being betrayed, arrested, interrogated, and crucified. 


All of that is recounted in Mark, as well, but there is an intensity in Matthew’s 
narrative that readers have found disturbing. 
●
●For instance, like Mark, Matthew tells of Jesus being questioned by the 
Jewish leaders and by Pilate. But Matthew intensifies the sense of conflict, as 
the Jewish leaders relentlessly pressure Pilate to crucify Jesus. 
●
●At a pivotal moment, Pilate asks for some water, and he washes his hands of 
the whole affair. He declares that he will not be responsible for Jesus’s death. 
At that, the Jewish leaders say, “Let his blood be on us and on our children.” 


But Matthew’s story of redemption is finally directed toward life, not death. 
After recounting the crucifixion and burial, the gospel concludes with an 
expanded account of Jesus’s resurrection. Here, the ground shakes and an angel 
descends from heaven to open the tomb. The angel tells the women who visit 
In Western history, the scene

death has sometimes been

172
the tomb that Jesus is alive and will meet them in Galilee. As they go to tell the 
other disciples, the women are met by the risen Jesus himself, who repeats the 
angel’s message.


The final scene takes readers to a mountaintop in Galilee, where the crucified 
and now living Jesus appears to the disciples. It’s a dazzling climax, as the 
disciples bow before him and worship. The tensions in the story now seem to 
be resolved, with death is turned into life. Yet Matthew notes that even here, 
some of the disciples doubted. This is an intriguing detail, because even at the 
climactic moment, faith and doubt continue to exist side by side. And it’s this 
mixed group of believers and skeptics that Jesus sends out with his teaching.

LECTURE 26
Luke on a World Upside Down
 T 
he Gospel of Luke contains many passages that are widely popular, 
including the Christmas story with the angels and shepherds, some 
of the best-loved parables, and scenes of Easter. For many readers, the 
narrative seems simple and appealing. Yet Luke also has a subversive dimension, and 
one of the major themes is reversal. The author seems to revel in stories where the 
high and mighty are moved to the periphery and those on the margin are brought 
to the center. With that in mind, we’ll look at this gospel in three sections: the 
beginning, which tells of Jesus’s birth; the middle, which presents his message; and 
the end, which tells of his death and resurrection.
Jesus’s Birth


The birth narrative of Jesus begins in the middle of chapter 1, where Luke takes 
us to the village of Nazareth in Galilee. There, an angel appears to a virgin 
named Mary and announces that she will give birth to the child Jesus. This 
scene is traditionally called the Annunciation. 


Despite the fact that Mary is a peasant from an obscure village, the angel says 
that her child will fulfill God’s ancient promises to King David. He will inherit 
the throne of Israel and establish an everlasting kingdom. Mary shares this news 
with a relative named Elizabeth in a poem or song that captures the theme of 
reversal. She tells of God bringing down the high and mighty, while lifting up 
powerless. It’s a vision of God turning the world upside-down. 


The Christmas story begins with Mary and Joseph traveling from Nazareth to 
Bethlehem for the census decreed by Caesar Augustus. When they arrive, they 
have no place to stay. Mary must give birth in a barn and place the infant in 
the animals’ feeding trough. For the author of Luke, the scene is subversive. He 
shows God’s action unfolding through a couple that is temporarily homeless 
and not from the seat of imperial authority. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
174


The reversal continues when an angel appears to shepherds in the fields nearby. 
Interestingly, the angel transfers the title savior—which was often used for the 
emperor—to the child in the barn and says that the child’s coming signals peace 
on earth. It’s a move that shifts the claims of the emperor to the periphery while 
bringing people on the margin to the center, where they receive the message of 
God’s favor. 
Jesus’s Sermon at Nazareth


Chapter 4 of Luke marks the beginning of Jesus’s public activity and sets 
a direction for what is to come. Jesus goes to the synagogue in Nazareth and 
is handed a scroll, from which he reads: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He sent me to 
proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free 
those who are oppressed, and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” 


Then, Jesus adds, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” The 
listeners are initially pleased because they assume they are the primary recipients 
of God’s favor. Yet Jesus is speaking about the poor, the captives, the blind, and 
the oppressed—those who, by definition, are not at the center of things. Thus, 
as he extends God’s favor to those on the margins, those who see themselves as 
privileged feel displaced. And out of that sense of displacement, hostility will 
emerge. 


From this point on, readers can expect that Jesus will be seen as a threat by 
traditional insiders but will be welcomed by those outside. The angry response 
he receives in Nazareth foreshadows the resistance that will lead to his death. 
Parable of the Good Samaritan


At the end of Luke 9, Jesus sets out for Jerusalem, planning to cross the region 
of Samaria. The Samaritans were people brought by the Assyrians from other 
nations to colonize the area. These newcomers intermarried with local people 
and blended their religious traditions with those of Israel, but they did not 
identify with Jerusalem and its temple. Indeed, the Jews and the Samaritans 
viewed each other with suspicion. 

Lecture 26—Luke on a World Upside Down 
175


Against this backdrop of ethnic and religious tension, we come to chapter 10 and 
the parable of the Good Samaritan. Jesus is preaching during his travels, when 
a Jewish lawyer asks him, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” In 
response, Jesus tells a parable that challenges the man to answer his own question. 


Jesus describes a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho, who is attacked by 
robbers and left for dead by the side of the road. A priest then walks by—a 
man of high social status—but he passes the victim without offering help. A 
Levite, who also has social status, does the same. A third figure, the Samaritan, 
comes along, tends the man’s injuries, and takes him to an inn to recover. The 
Samaritan is an outsider, yet he cares for a stranger, lying beside the road. 


The parable works through the interplay of several points of view. The lawyer 
who initially asked the question would most naturally identify with the priest 
The author of Luke 
is aware of the ethnic 
tensions around 
Samaria and even 
reminds us that the 
Samaritans refused to 
welcome Jesus, yet in 
the parable of the Good 
Samaritan, the ethnic 
and religious tensions 
become irrelevant.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
176
and the Levite. But Jesus presses him to ask how things look from the perspective 
of the injured man. For the one who is suffering, social status is irrelevant; what 
matters is compassion.
Parable of the Prodigal Son


The parable of the Prodigal Son appears in Luke 15, which presents another 
scene of social tension, in which Jesus is preaching to a group of tax collectors 
and sinners. Also present are the Pharisees and scribes, known for their careful 
attention to religious practice. When they see Jesus eating with a contemptible 
group of tax collectors and sinners, they are offended. And in response, Jesus 
tells a parable.


In this story, a man’s younger son asks for his inheritance before his father has 
died. Inexplicably, the father gives the son what he asks for. The boy leaves home 
and squanders the inheritance. He then decides to return home in hope that his 
father will hire him as a common laborer. Amazingly, the father runs out to 
meet the boy and calls for a banquet to celebrate his return. 


The elder son is highly offended by the gracious treatment given to his brother, 
but the father insists that graciousness toward the returning rebel does not mean 
indifference toward the son who stayed at home. What’s at stake for the father 
is the restoration of relationship. And if relationship is what matters, then why 
would reconciliation evoke resentment instead of celebration? 


Again, the parable works with different points of view. For those who see 
themselves as obedient, hard-working citizens, the story exposes resentment and 
holds it up to critique. But if people see themselves as flawed and disgraced, 
then the story offers hope for restoration. 
Jesus’s Death


In the final part of the story, Luke struggles with the way Jesus’s death fits into 
the narrative of his life. To some extent, the crucifixion seems inevitable. Ever 
since the initial sermon at Nazareth, Jesus has challenged those who feel a sense 

Lecture 26—Luke on a World Upside Down 
177
of privilege; given that approach, it’s not surprising that people in authority 
want to end his career. 


But Luke also asks whether crucifixion simply means that the old patterns 
continue. Is the death of Jesus one more instance where the powerful triumph 
and the innocent suffer? If so, then the theme of God’s compassion for the weak 
may seem like an empty promise. Thus, as the author of Luke recounts the 
crucifixion, he again brings out the elements of reversal. 


The main outline of Luke’s account is much like that of Mark and Matthew, 
yet it includes distinctive elements. For example, in Luke, before his execution, 
Jesus says, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” 
Recent literary studies point 
out that Jesus’s forgiveness of 
his executioners fits Luke’s 
portrayal of the savior; the 
saying fits the pattern in 
which Jesus counters the 
prevailing order by meeting 
hostility with grace.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
178


Next, Luke directs attention to the two criminals who are crucified alongside 
Jesus. One of them ridicules Jesus because he seems powerless. But the other 
one says, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And Jesus 
responds, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” 
●
●Here, Luke again portrays a reversal of judgment. He shows Jesus sharing the 
same fate as lowly criminals who are condemned for what they have done—
death. 
●
●Yet Jesus’s words about paradise counter the finality of that judgment with 
the prospect of hope. They create a sharp sense of contrast, as Jesus joins 
others in death while extending hope that they might join him in life.
●
●The narration tells us that a pall of darkness hangs over the land until Jesus 
commits his spirit to God and breathes his last. At the end of the chapter, 
things are unresolved. Death is real, yet Jesus offers hope that it will not be 
final. There is the promise of life to come, but paradise remains hidden from 
view, beyond the horizon of the narrative. 
Jesus’s Resurrection


As we come to the final chapter, we find one more instance of reversal, this one 
involving one of Jesus’s own disciples. In chapter 24, some women visit Jesus’s 
tomb and are told that he is not dead. The women tell the other disciples but 
are met with disbelief. Here, Luke introduces a new part of the story, as two of 
Jesus’s followers leave Jerusalem for the town of Emmaus. 


As they walk along, Jesus joins them, but they do not recognize him. The two 
followers report the tragedy of Jesus’s crucifixion to the stranger; the new has 
brought the hope of the people to nothing. Finally, they tell the stranger that 
they have heard Jesus is alive, but they apparently make nothing of it. 


Jesus alters their perspective by telling them that the suffering of the Messiah 
does not negate hope. Instead, it is the way hope is realized. He tells them to 
consider the message of the prophets. And we’re reminded that Jesus had read 
from the prophet Isaiah at the synagogue in Nazareth. Before he brought that 
message, Jesus had warned that he would meet resistance, as was true for the 
prophets before him. 

Lecture 26—Luke on a World Upside Down 
179


The crucial point is that the Messiah does not bring hope by avoiding suffering 
but by moving through it. That is how reversal takes place. To bring good news 
to the poor and the captives, the Messiah becomes poor and captive through his 
crucifixion. Then, he rises to life beyond.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Early in the narrative, the Magnificat (the song of Mary) tells of the mighty 
being brought down and the lowly being lifted up. How is this theme of 
reversal developed in Luke’s narrative? 
2.	 The parables of the Good Samaritan and Prodigal Son include multiple 
characters who represent different points of view. How do the contrasting 
viewpoints shape the readers’ perspectives about the central issue in each story?

LECTURE 27
John on the Word Made Flesh
 T 
he Gospel of John seems different to readers than the other New 
Testament gospels. Clement of Alexandria, for example, wrote that the 
first three gospels provided the “physical things” about Jesus’s life, while 
John wrote a “spiritual gospel.” John begins with soaring poetic lines that identify 
Jesus as the divine Word of God. And in the narrative itself, Jesus’s actions are called 
“signs” because they signify divine truths. Yet John also gives importance to “physical 
things.” John says the Word of God “became flesh” in Jesus. His actions convey 
divine reality through things that can be heard, seen, and touched. The point of it 
all is so that humanity might have life—not simply spiritual life but authentic life. 
The Logos


Unlike the other New Testament gospels, the Gospel of John introduces the 
story of Jesus in the context of God’s creation of the world. It says, “In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” 
John says that in the Word “was life, and the life was the light for human beings. 
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.”


The introduction is poetic. The language has a repetitive, almost rhythmic 
quality, and it engages the imagination through evocative imagery. The most 
striking aspect is the Greek term logos, which is usually translated “word.” In 
ordinary usage, a logos or “word” is a form of communication. It is the way we 
bring thought into expression. 


John identifies this power to communicate with the power to create. His gospel 
says that through the logos, God brings all things into being. Many ancient 
readers would have caught John’s allusion to the opening chapters of Genesis, 
where God created the heavens and earth by speaking. By echoing the story of 
God creating by his Word, John alerts readers that the same dynamic is at work 
in the story of Jesus.

Lecture 27—John on the Word Made Flesh 
181
●
●Indeed, John says that what the logos brings is life, and he describes such 
life as a kind of light for human beings. In a basic sense, life has a physical 
dimension. It involves heartbeats and breathing. And it was common for 
ancient writers to identify life with the radiance of light and to equate 
darkness with death. 
●
●Yet John also recognizes that true life—authentic life—is more than that. 
Philosophers of his day insisted that true life emerged as one moved out of 
the darkness of ignorance into the light of understanding. In this process, a 
person would turn from the darkness of evil to the light of good. 
●
●Up to a point, the author of John would agree. But he argues that life must 
be seen in more theological or relational terms. For him, darkness is not 
only ignorance but alienation—human alienation from the God who made 
us. Thus, light not only means coming to know God but being restored in 
relationship with God. For John, that is where true life is found.


That relational aspect informs the pivotal statement in verse 14: “The Word 
became flesh and dwelt among us.” The idea is that the Word of God, which 
creates all things and gives life, now encounters people in embodied form. 
According to John, Jesus is the embodied Word of God, who conveys the 
creative will of God by what he says, by what he does, and by who he is. And 
the goal of God’s Word becoming flesh is restoring human beings to life in 
relationship with the God who made them. 
Turning Water into Wine


In the next section of John, Jesus conveys divine reality to people through 
actions, called signs. They include miraculous gifts of food and drink, healings, 
and even the raising of the dead. The author of John was keenly aware that 
actions are ambiguous and can be construed in different ways. Thus, his 
challenge was to create a narrative context in which meaning could be discerned. 


The first sign occurs when Jesus turns water into wine. The disciples go with 
Jesus to a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee, where Jesus’s mother is also 
present. In John’s gospel, we often find that people talk past each other, and 
that is the case here. When the wedding celebration has been going on for some 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
182
time, Jesus’s mother comments that the wine has run out. But Jesus replies, 
“Woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.”


The reference to Jesus’s hour is cryptic. We will eventually learn that it refers to 
the hour or time of his death and resurrection. But here, Jesus’s mother focuses 
on the immediate situation and directs the servants to do whatever Jesus tells 
them. He, in turn, transforms six stone jars filled with water into wine.


What does the gift of wine mean? John says that it reveals Jesus’s glory (Greek: 
doxa), possibly connoting the power and presence of God. In this context, a 
sign is an action that reveals divine power in a manner accessible to the senses. 
To do so by a lavish gift of wine displays divine favor. For the disciples, the gift 
confirms their conviction that Jesus is the agent of God. 
Feeding the Multitudes


John is keenly aware that actions are ambiguous, and people often interpret 
actions differently. He helps readers engage the interpretive process by bringing 
the struggle over meaning into the narrative itself. 


A good example is the story of Jesus feeding 5,000 people, which appears in all 
four gospels. What makes John’s version unique is the attention to what this 
action means. 
●
●For example, the crowd initially interprets the sign in the framework of the 
Passover tradition. They call Jesus a prophet, a new Moses, who miraculously 
feeds them, and they want to make this prophet their king. But instead of 
allowing it, Jesus slips away. 
●
●The problem here concerns the nature of Jesus’s kingship. In the Roman 
world, an aspiring ruler could attract supporters by giving away free food 
and providing entertainment; John portrays the crowd this way. After 
enjoying the free food Jesus provides, they are eager to make him king, with 
the assumption that free food will keep coming in the future.
●
●Thus, later in the chapter, Jesus offers a different interpretation. The crowd 
follows him to a synagogue in the town of Capernaum, where he says that 
they have failed to see what the sign actually meant. He tells them they 

Lecture 27—John on the Word Made Flesh 
183
should work not for what he calls the “food that perishes” but for “food that 
endures to eternal life.” 
●
●What Jesus is saying is that true life—life that really matters—must have a 
different quality. The people of Moses’s generation spent their time gathering 
manna only to die in the desert. But if that’s all life is, what’s the point? Jesus 
says that when he gave the crowd bread, the sign pointed to God as the 
ultimate giver, to Jesus himself as the gift, and to life as restored relationship. 


As you explore this passage, it is helpful to consider that the underlying issue is 
what life means. The crowd has enough to eat, yet for them, life is essentially a 
constant struggle to get more of what they already have. Jesus offers a different 
perspective, which emphasizes the relational aspects of life. He points to the 
irony that the obsession with bread can actually diminish life by blinding people 
to the need for relationships that give life. 
Healing the Blind Man


Several chapters later, Jesus and his disciples encounter a man who was born 
blind. The disciples ask who sinned to cause this divine punishment—the man 
or his parents—but Jesus replies that neither did. 


In other words, the model of sin and punishment does not work in this case. 
Jesus simply accepts the blindness as a given. Instead of trying to explain it—
which wouldn’t help—he leaves the question about the cause of the blindness 
unanswered. 


The way forward in this situation is through healing. Jesus defines his role by 
saying, “I am the light of the world.” To live out his role as the giver of light, he 
puts mud on the blind man’s eyes and sends him to wash in a pool. When the 
man does so, he can see. But that sparks a new series of questions about what 
the healing means.


In the middle of chapter 9, we learn that for the Jewish authorities, the healing 
is problematic because it is work that takes place on the Sabbath. But the man 
who was healed takes the view that it was divine action, calling Jesus a prophet. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
184


For the author of John, the man who was initially blind regained his sight 
physically and developed insight about the identity of his healer. At the same 
time, the authorities, who could always see physically, became increasingly blind 
to the idea that God might be at work in the healing. 
Raising Lazarus


In chapter 11, Jesus performs the sign that marks the climax of his public career: 
raising a man from the dead. Jesus receives word that his friend Lazarus is 
seriously ill from the man’s sisters, Mary and Martha. Initially, he does nothing 
but, after two days, decides to visit Lazarus, leaving the disciples to wonder why 
he put off the visit. Jesus compounds their confusion when he announces that 
Lazarus is dead. The disciples can’t fathom why Jesus would risk his safety to 
visit a corpse in a region where he faced mounting opposition to his teaching. 
In addition to the other ways in which Jesus has 
given life to humanity, in the story of Lazarus, 
he returns his friend to literal, mortal life; it’s 
hard to imagine a clearer miracle.

Lecture 27—John on the Word Made Flesh 
185


In the next scene, Jesus arrives in Bethany, where Lazarus has been in the tomb 
for four days, but Martha voices the hope that her brother will rise again at the 
last day, that is, at the end of the age.


In a statement typical of John’s gospel, Jesus reframes the issue in relational 
terms. He says, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, 
even though they die, will live. And those who live and believe in me will never 
die.” The idea is that death is real for everyone, but the gospel claims that faith 
brings people into relationship with God that is true life, and that relationship 
is not terminated by death. It has a future through the hope of resurrection. 


Ultimately, Jesus brings Lazarus back to life, but this miracle generates 
opposition in some quarters. In the eyes of Jesus’s detractors, the life-giver is 
becoming too popular. For Jesus’s opponents, a sign that involves the giving 
of life is not a gift but a threat. And to avoid the possibility of Roman military 
action, some begin planning to put the life-giver to death.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The theme of life has multiple dimensions in John’s Gospel. What are its 
main dimensions, and how are they reflected in the episodes considered in 
the lecture?
2.	 John shows that people responded to Jesus’s miracles or signs in contradictory 
ways. Why did some see the healing miracles positively? Why did some see 
them negatively? Why does the writer show us these conflicting points of view?

LECTURE 28
Self-Giving Love According 
to John
 I 
n the first half of John, the writer tells us of Jesus’s signs, but the meaning 
of these actions is often unclear. The narrative identifies conflicting points 
of view and, through the interplay of different perspectives, points to the 
central idea that Jesus is the giver of life. In this lecture, we’ll look at the second 
half of the gospel, where the challenge of discerning meaning continues. Here, the 
central question is this: If Jesus is the giver of life, what should we make of his 
crucifixion? As we read John’s final chapters, we will explore how the writer relates 
the crucifixion to self-giving love, the continuation of relationship, the completion 
of Jesus’s work, and the dynamics of faith. 
Self-Giving Love


The first sentence of John 13 tells us that even before the Passover meal, Jesus 
knew that the hour had come for him to depart from this world. Thus, “having 
loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.” The writer 
knows that he is about to describe Jesus doing things that can be construed in 
different ways. To prepare readers to see the meaning of these events differently, 
John asks them to interpret everything that Jesus does as an expression of love. 


The main action in the opening scene is remarkably simple: Jesus washing and 
drying the feet of his disciples. But in terms of ordinary practice, everything 
about this is disorienting. Jesus interrupts the meal to engage in foot washing, 
assumes the attire of a slave by putting on a servant’s towel, and does the work 
of a slave by washing his disciples’ feet.


When Peter asks why their teacher is acting as a slave toward his followers, Jesus 
responds that what he is doing is essential for their relationship. As readers, we 
see foot washing as an expression of utter devotion. By taking on the role of a 
slave, Jesus conveys the extent of his love. 

Lecture 28—Self-Giving Love According to John 
187
●
●The fact that Judas, who has already decided to betray Jesus, is still in the 
room gives the foot washing a more radical quality. The devil has already 
put betrayal into Judas’s heart, yet Jesus responds by washing Judas’s feet, 
which is a gesture of love. The narrative also tells us that Jesus knows which 
of the disciples will betray him. By washing the feet of Judas, along with 
those of the other disciples, Jesus transforms love into an act of resistance. It 
confronts evil and the hatred it represents. 
●
●In John’s Gospel, this kind of militant love defines Jesus’s course of action, 
and it will come to full expression in the crucifixion. In John 15:13, Jesus 
says, “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for one’s 
friends.” Jesus conveys love in a preliminary way by washing the feet of his 
friends and his betrayer. And he will convey love in a more radical way when 
he confronts hostility again and lays down his life through the crucifixion.


This kind of love also defines the disciples’ actions. After washing their feet, 
Jesus says he has given an example, which he then he puts as a commandment: 
“Just as I have loved you, you are to love one another.” Unlike the earlier 
commandment to love others as we love ourselves, the disciples are to love 
others as Jesus loves them. They are to see themselves as recipients of a love that 
comes from outside themselves and, in turn, to bring that love to expression. 
The Continuation of Relationship


In all four gospels, Jesus spends time in conversation with the disciples during 
the Last Supper. In John, the main issue in this section (John 14–17) is the 
threat of separation. Jesus tells the disciples that it is time for him to depart. 
Yet in the face of his impending departure, he speaks about ways in which his 
relationship with them will continue. 


Jesus hones in vividly on the issue of separation when he says, “I will not 
leave you orphaned.” On one level, being orphaned depicts the immediate 
situation of the disciples, who will soon experience the trauma of Jesus’s 
crucifixion. But on another level, it also speaks to the situation of later readers, 
who lived decades after Jesus’s ministry had ended. They were a minority 
group in a society where most people did not share their beliefs, and they felt 
marginalized or orphaned. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
188


These chapters speak to that issue in two ways. One is by emphasizing that 
relationships continue through the work of God’s Spirit. A second is through 
community. In chapter 15, Jesus says, “I am the vine, you are the branches.” 
Throughout the Mediterranean world, hillsides were planted with vines. A vine 
had a main woody stem, from which branches grew out and became intertwined 
with each other. And on these interwoven branches, clusters of grapes would 
form. It’s one of the gospel’s most vivid images for community.
The Completion of Jesus’s Work


Like the other gospels, John recounts Jesus’s arrest, the hearings before the 
authorities, and the crucifixion. We’ve seen that each gospel must deal with 
what Jesus’s death means. Mark and Matthew show Jesus sharing the depth of 
human suffering. Luke brings out the aspect of grace in the face of judgment. In 
John, the meaning relates to the completion of Jesus’s work.
The vine image addresses 
the underlying issue of 
separation; it pictures 
a community in which 
people’s lives intertwine 
with those of Jesus and 
with other people, like 
the branches on a vine.

Lecture 28—Self-Giving Love According to John 
189


Making this idea the center of the crucifixion narrative seems counterintuitive. 
After all, many aspects of the story suggest that death is the tragic interruption 
of Jesus’s work, not its fitting conclusion. The gospel has shown how Jesus’s 
opponents charge that he is a lawbreaker and a blasphemer; from that 
perspective, Jesus’s death is a victory for his opponents because it brings his 
activity to an end. 


John’s challenge is to show how crucifixion can possibly be seen as the 
meaningful completion of Jesus’s public activity. In doing so, the author depicts 
scenes that are unique to this gospel, including the appearance of Jesus’s mother 
and an unnamed disciple at the execution. 


In the gospel itself, the main action is remarkably simple. Jesus says to his 
mother, “Woman, here is your son.” And he says to the disciple, “Here is your 
mother.” From that time on, the disciple takes her into his home. What’s striking 
is that the crucifixion culminates in a scene where relationships are formed. Jesus 
completes his work by entrusting two people to each other, and as he does so, he 
forms the nucleus of a community that will continue beyond his death.
●
●Scholars note that John builds a kind of symmetry into the narrative. Jesus’s 
mother appears only twice in the gospel: once at the wedding in Cana and 
once at the crucifixion. At Cana, Jesus did the first of his signs, turning 
water into wine. And at the cross, Jesus gives people to each other before he 
drinks sour wine. After he drinks the wine, he speaks his final words, “It is 
completed,” and dies.
●
●The symmetry in the narrative invites readers to connect the giving of excellent 
wine at Cana with the drinking of sour wine at the cross. But that literary 
connection suggests meaning rather than making it explicit. At Cana, Jesus 
gives the wine as a sign of divine favor. And the scenes at the cross complete 
the act of giving, as Jesus gives people to each other and gives up his own life. 
In John’s gospel, that act of self-giving discloses the character of Jesus’s work. 


The final scenes in the crucifixion narrative are equally suggestive. We learn that 
it is late in the day, and the Jewish authorities don’t want Jesus or those crucified 
with him to remain on the cross until the next day. The two men crucified with 
Jesus are still alive, but Jesus is already dead. The soldiers pierce his side with a 
spear and out comes blood and water.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
190
●
●It’s clear that the details here are important, but the writer stops short of 
explaining what they mean. Instead, he relates each detail to a passage from 
the Old Testament and lets readers reflect on the implications. 
●
●For example, the writer connects the piercing of Jesus’s side with a passage 
from the book of Zechariah that says, “They will look on him whom they 
have pierced.” What are we supposed to see? One might expect a wound 
to produce blood, but the gospel adds that water also came out, which is 
peculiar. And that’s apparently the point. For John, the death of Jesus goes 
beyond the ordinary.
●
●Elsewhere in the gospel, water is understood to bring life. And life has been 
a theme since chapter 1. There, the writer identified Jesus as the Word of 
God, who brings life. Later, he is called the bread of life and the resurrection 
and the life. If we keep reading, we find him portrayed as the source of living 
water, which leads to eternal life. Thus, the water flowing from Jesus’s side 
suggests that even in death, he is a source of life. 
The Dynamics of Faith


In the final chapters of John, we again find people struggling to discern the 
meaning of what they see. The action starts in chapter 20, when Mary Magdalene 
comes to the tomb in which Jesus’s body had been laid and sees that it is open. 
She assumes that if the tomb has been opened, it’s an instance of grave robbery, 
and she tells two other disciples that the body of Jesus has been taken. 


When the disciples arrive at the tomb, the question of interpretation continues. 
They see that the linen cloth that had been wrapped around the body of Jesus is 
still there, which would make grave robbery unlikely. Then, the disciples simply 
leave the scene, without saying anything.

Mary Magdalene looks into the tomb and sees two angels inside, but that 
doesn’t impress her. She tells them that Jesus’s body has been stolen, then turns 
away without waiting for their response. Next, she sees the risen Jesus standing 
in front of her, but she believes him to be a gardener and asks for information 
about the missing body.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The concept of love has a central place in John’s gospel. How does John’s 
presentation of the foot washing and crucifixion explore different aspects of 
love?
2.	 The lecture concluded with the story of Thomas’s skepticism and encounter 
with the risen Jesus. Several different ways of construing that episode were 
noted. Do you find any of those interpretations helpful? What do you think

LECTURE 29
The Early Church in Acts
 T 
he book of Acts was written by the same person who wrote Luke’s Gospel, 
and it traces the activities of Jesus’s followers from around the year 30 to 
around the year 60 of the 1st century. The book itself was written some 
decades later, after the events it describes. The writer looks back to that early formative 
period with the perspective of hindsight. In this lecture, we’ll consider the first 11 
chapters of Acts, focusing in particular on three topics: the early Christian community’s 
formation, internal and external conflicts that shaped the community’s identity, and 
the community’s expansion to include people from various ethnic groups. 
Formation of the Community


The story of Acts begins after the resurrection, when Jesus is still with the 
disciples in Jerusalem. In Acts 1:8, he tells them that the Holy Spirit will 
come upon them and they will be his witnesses “in Jerusalem, and in all Judea 
and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” In the chapters to come, the Spirit 
of God descends, and the disciples gradually move outward to cities across 
the region.


This process begins in chapter 2, as the writer portrays the early church being 
formed as a renewal movement within Judaism. The focus of this episode is 
the coming of God’s Spirit to the disciples. The setting is the Jewish festival of 
Pentecost, which signals the beginning of the wheat harvest. Worshippers would 
travel to Jerusalem to offer the first ripe sheaves of wheat at the temple. Thus, 
in Jewish tradition, Pentecost is when the harvest begins. In Acts, it’s when the 
new community begins. 


Jesus’s followers have gathered together, and a powerful wind surges through 
the house where they are sitting. A flame hovers over the head of each one of 
them. Then, they are filled with the Holy Spirit and begin speaking in other 
languages. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
194
●
●For the writer of Acts, this is a miracle of communication. The Spirit 
empowers the followers of Jesus to communicate their message in the many 
different languages of the world. 
●
●Since the conquests of Alexander the Great, the idea had been that to form an 
empire, a common language was needed for administration and commerce. 
In the story of the Pentecost in Acts, 
Jesus’s followers experience a miracle 
of communication: the descent of the 
Holy Spirit and the empowerment 
to begin speaking other languages.

Lecture 29—The Early Church in Acts 
195
But at this gathering in Acts, that pattern is reversed. Here, a community is 
formed around a common message that’s conveyed in multiple languages. 
●
●From this point onward, the community of Jesus’s followers will face the 
challenge of maintaining the integrity if its beliefs while adapting itself to the 
world’s many languages and cultures.


In Acts 2, Peter gives a speech that interprets the experience of God’s Spirit as 
the fulfillment of scripture. He quotes from the Old Testament prophet Joel, 
who envisioned a time when God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh, not 
just a few inspired individuals. The Spirit would be given to men and women, 
to old and young, to slaves and free people, and the whole community would 
prophesy. Peter sees this taking place among the followers of Jesus. 
●
●As people respond favorably to the message, they are baptized. They then 
form a community in which they share all their resources, giving each 
member of the group what they need from a common fund. 
●
●It’s an attempt to create an ideal community, but as the story continues, we 
find that the ideal is not sustainable. The writer of Acts must now consider 
what it means for this community to deal with conflict.
Internal and External Conflict


In the second part of Acts, conflict—both within and outside the Christian 
community—is a major theme. In chapter 6, for example, a conflict emerges 
within the community. The writer says that the Christian community in 
Jerusalem includes two groups: the Hebrews and the Hellenists. Both groups are 
of Jewish background, and both have become followers of Jesus. But they speak 
different languages and reflect different cultures. 


The Hebrews are Jewish Christians who speak Hebrew or Aramaic as their 
primary language. Their outlook is formed by traditional patterns of life in 
Judea and areas nearby. The Hellenists are also Jewish Christians, but they speak 
Greek and are more open to Greco-Roman culture. 


The flashpoint here is not a lofty question about religious truth but a practical 
matter. The Hellenist speakers complain against the Hebrews, because the 
widows in their subgroup are missing out on the daily distribution of food. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
196
The issue of resources generates conflict, but conflict generates change. And this 
is another important theme in Acts. The author recognizes that there was no 
golden age of peace and harmony but that conflict is a persistent feature of 
social life. For him, the question is how conflict will be addressed. 


Ultimately, Peter and some of the other disciples have the Hellenists take on 
the task of distributing food. They give the job to disciples named Stephen 
and Philip and to five other men. It’s a constructive response to conflict in the 
community, but the division of labor proves unstable. Stephen is not content 
to distribute food while the original disciples preach. Interestingly, newer 
leaders, such as Stephen, become key spokespeople for the Christian message. 
At this juncture, they move the story forward, while the old guard remains in 
the background.


Stephen’s version of the message of Jesus quickly provokes opposition from the 
wider Jewish community in Jerusalem. They charge that he is denigrating both 
Jewish law and the temple. Thus, in chapter 7, Stephen recounts the story of 
Israel, from Abraham up to the time Solomon builds the temple. The theme of 
the speech is how God accomplishes his purposes despite conflict within Israel. 
What makes Stephen’s speech distinctive is the way he recounts these episodes 
around the theme of conflict. 


For Stephen, the pattern of conflict culminates when Jesus is put to death. 
This is where the speech reaches its rhetorical climax. Stephen’s opponents 
have charged that his message about Jesus somehow denigrates the Law of 
Moses. But Stephen argues that the narratives in the law recount ongoing 
opposition to God. And that opposition culminates in the execution of Jesus, 
which Stephen refers to as murder. The highlight of Stephen’s speech is that 
the true lawbreakers are Jesus’s opponents; they are the ones who support the 
unlawful taking of life. 


Those listening to Stephen are outraged, and they continue the pattern 
of rejection by dragging him out of the city and stoning him to death. But 
like Jesus, before he dies, Stephen asks that God not hold this sin against his 
murderers. 

Lecture 29—The Early Church in Acts 
197


These final words of forgiveness are like a shaft of light in an otherwise dark 
scene. And they continue the positive side of the pattern set by Stephen’s speech. 
On the negative side, we’ve seen Stephen portray opposition to Joseph, Moses, 
and Jesus. Now Stephen’s own death continues that negative aspect. But on the 
positive side, Stephen said that at each juncture, God refused to let opposition 
close off the future.
Expansion of the Community


As Stephen predicted, conflict didn’t bring an end to the Christina community 
but led to its expansion. Acts 8 says that after the death of Stephen, opposition 
to the followers of Jesus intensified, and many of them left Jerusalem and 
founded communities elsewhere. In the process of expansion, the community 
encountered new issues about how to relate to people of different backgrounds. 


We see aspects of this issue in chapter 8, where Philip, who was one of the 
Hellenists, goes to Samaria. For centuries, there had been tension between 
Samaritans and Jews, but when Philip goes to Samaria, he brings the message of 
Jesus and provides healing to the sick. The narrative says that many Samaritans 
embrace the message and are baptized. Thus, it is clear that for the followers 
of Jesus, the older ethnic tensions are not to be a barrier to sharing a common 
faith. 


The writer also shows that there were aspects of Samaritan culture that Jesus’s 
early followers resisted, including sorcery or magic. For example, Acts 8 describes 
a magician in Samaria who offers money in exchange for by the spiritual power 
of Philip and others in the Christian community. In the narrative, this idea 
is explicitly rejected. The community clarifies its identity by including people 
from different ethnic backgrounds, such as Samaritans, but rules out practices 
that seem incompatible with the faith. 


The process continues as Philip travels to the south, where he encounters an 
Ethiopian court official who is also a eunuch. According to Jewish law, no 
eunuch could be part of the community of Israel, but Philip takes the bold 
step of baptizing the Ethiopian. Here, we find that such issues as ethnicity and 
physical condition are overcome through a common faith. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
198


In chapter 10, the community expands still further into the non-Jewish world. 
One of the major figures in this story is a Roman military officer named 
Cornelius. He reveres the God of Israel, but he is not part of the Jewish 
community. His counterpart in the story is the apostle Peter, who is a follower 
of Jesus and keeps Jewish practices. In the Jewish port city of Joppa, Peter 
confronts what it means for the community to include non-Jews who accept 
the message of Jesus. 
●
●According to the book of Acts, both Cornelius and Peter receive visions 
more or less at the same time, although they have never met each other. 
Cornelius is directed to send messengers from Caesarea to Joppa to find 
Peter. Peter in turn has a vision that prepares him to welcome these non-
Jewish visitors. 
●
●Peter sees a sheet being lowered from heaven that contains animals of all 
sorts, including those considered both clean and unclean in the Jewish 
tradition. When a voice tells Peter that he can eat from all of them, Peter 
objects. He says he has never eaten things that are unclean. But then he is 
told, “What God has made clean, you must not consider impure.” Note 
that the voice says that God can make clean what has been unclean. God 
has the power to bring change. 
●
●Soon, the messengers from Cornelius arrive and invite Peter to Caesarea. 
When he meets Cornelius, he realizes what his vision means. Peter sees 
that God shows no partiality. People from every nation who revere God 
and do what is right are acceptable to God. His task is to extend Jesus’s 
offer of forgiveness to everyone, while calling them to a common faith. 
And as Peter says this, there is a repetition of the Christians’ Pentecost 
experience. Those listening to Peter find themselves moved by the Spirit. 
And that experience is understood to be a divine affirmation of what Peter 
has said.

Questions to Consider
1.	 The book of Acts pictures the Christian community engaging people from 
different cultural backgrounds. At what points did the community accept 
differences in a positive way? When did the community critique cultural 
practices? Why would the community be accepting in some instances and 
critical in others?
2.	 Conflict plays an important role in the book of Acts. What negative aspects 
of conflict emerge in these episodes? What positive responses to conflict 
occur? How does conflict advance the narrative?

LECTURE 30
Paul’s Calling
 T 
he apostle Paul was one of the most controversial figures in early 
Christianity. In his early life, he was a violent opponent of the Christian 
community, but later, he became one of its most famous advocates. He 
was of Jewish background, but he spread the Christian message to non-Jews in 
the cities of the Roman Empire. In his own time, some saw him as a hero of the 
faith. Others saw him as a threat to tradition. In this lecture, we’ll look at how he 
is portrayed in the book of Acts, which tells the story of his career; in later lectures, 
we’ll explore Paul’s letters. 
Paul’s Early Life


Acts tells us that Paul had a complex relationship to Jewish tradition and 
Greco-Roman culture. He was probably born around the beginning of the 1st 
century and, according to Acts, was from the city of Tarsus (in modern Turkey). 
Culturally, Tarsus was known for education in Greek philosophy and rhetoric, 
and politically, it was part of the Roman Empire. 


While growing up at Tarsus, Paul belonged to the Jewish community, and Acts 
tells us that he had a Hebrew name, Saul. But he also grew up speaking Greek, 
and he had the Greco-Roman name Paulus or Paul. Acts tells us that he was 
born a Roman citizen, although that would have been unusual for Jews in 
Tarsus.


Acts also says that Paul’s identity was shaped by a move to Jerusalem. There, 
Paul joined the Pharisees, who were known for their devotion to Jewish law and 
rigor in matters of purity. Further, Acts tells us that in Jerusalem, Paul spoke 
Hebrew or, perhaps, Aramaic, which was the local language. He studied with 
Rabbi Gamaliel, the most famous Jewish teacher of the period. 

Lecture 30—Paul’s Calling 
201
The Reshaping of Paul’s Identity


Paul is first mentioned in the context of the martyrdom of Stephen, a disciple of 
Jesus who was stoned earlier in Acts. There, we find that Paul was present at the 
killing of Stephen and approved of it. Then, the text describes Paul embarking 
on his own campaign against the church. The writer does not give the reason for 
Paul’s hostility, but the impression is that he saw the message of Jesus as a threat 
to Jewish beliefs and practices.


In chapter 9, Paul is traveling from Jerusalem to Damascus, apparently in 
some official capacity, in order to arrest Christians there. In this incident, we 
find a pattern that is similar to what Peter and the Roman officer Cornelius 
experienced when each had a vision that gave a new direction to his actions. In 
this story, the two people are Paul and a Christian named Ananias. Again, each 
of them has a vision, and in the process, each of them is transformed. 
After his conversion on the 
road to Damascus, Paul is 
blinded both physically and 
spiritually—he can’t “see” 
what the experience means; 
later, he will regain his sight.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
202


Paul is virulent in his outrage at Jesus’s followers, but on the road to Damascus, 
a light flashes around him and he falls to the ground. A voice asks, “Saul, Saul, 
why do you persecute me?” Paul replies with a question of his own: “Who are 
you Lord?” And he is told, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But get up 
and enter the city, and you will be told what to do.” 


Paul is blinded by the light. In a physical sense, he can’t see at this point, but 
he also can’t see in a deeper sense. He can’t see what this experience means. He 
had planned to arrest Jesus’s followers and take them out of the city. But now, 
Paul’s companions must take him into the city, where one of Jesus’s followers 
will meet him and change his life. Eventually, Paul will regain his sight 
physically, and at a deeper level, he will come to see himself and his calling in a 
dramatically new way. 


The scene then shifts to Ananias, a follower of Jesus, who lives in Damascus. 
Ananias has a vision in which Jesus tells him to go to a certain house and heal 
Paul. Ananias knows that Paul is determined to arrest Jesus’s followers; thus, the 
prospect of going to help Paul seems unthinkable. Still, Ananias goes to Paul 
and prays for the healing of his enemy. Paul regains his sight and is baptized 
into the faith he once rejected.
Paul’s Interactions with Jews and Greeks


The changes taking place in Paul became linked to larger changes taking place 
in the Christian community itself. We have seen that Paul was the product 
of different cultures: Jewish, Greek, and Roman. And the first part of Acts 
indicates that the Christian community itself was beginning to include people 
from various ethnic backgrounds. 


The followers of Jesus in Antioch (south-central Turkey) were initially of Jewish 
background, but in the middle of chapter 11, some of them intentionally reach out 
to Greeks, including non-Jewish Greeks. And it is Antioch, rather than Jerusalem, 
that becomes the dynamic center of the effort to spread the Christian faith. 


After his experience in Damascus, Paul eventually joins the community in 
Antioch, where it is decided that he should be sent out to extend the faith 

Lecture 30—Paul’s Calling 
203
beyond the local level. Paul and his friend Barnabas first set sail for the island of 
Cyprus, then go north to what today is Turkey. 


In the middle of chapter 13, Paul engages Jewish listeners. The setting is a 
different city named Antioch, this one in the region of Pisidia. There, Paul visits 
a synagogue and is invited to speak. He delivers a speech that is similar to one 
by Stephen from earlier in Acts. The theme is God’s persistent graciousness 
despite resistance within Israel. 
Some scholars think the term Christian 
was originally used pejoratively by those 
outside the community; in time, the 
community adopted the term for itself to 
indicate its members’ shared connection 
with Christ despite different backgrounds.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
204
●
●The first half of the speech recounts biblical episodes in which God acted 
for the good of the people. God brought them out of Egypt, led them to 
the Promised Land, and gave them David as their king. Then Paul adds that 
God’s graciousness continued when he sent Jesus with a message of salvation. 
●
●At this point, Paul contrasts God’s actions with resistance from the people, 
culminating in the crucifixion of Jesus. Then he returns to the theme of God’s 
persistent graciousness, which led to raising Jesus from the dead. In this 
speech, the resurrection demonstrates God’s refusal to let human opposition 
close off the future. Where hostility led to Jesus’s death, the resurrection shows 
that God’s will is for life. We can see how the speech tries to connect the 
message about Jesus with the way God was understood in Israel’s tradition. 


In chapter 14, Paul travels to the town of Lystra, where he encounters a man 
who cannot walk. Paul heals him, much as Jesus heals people in the gospels. In 
response, bystanders at Lystra equate Paul and Barnabas with Zeus and Hermes, 
gods who might have been the source of healing in the Greek religious tradition. 
●
●Paul needs to find common ground with these Greek speakers, even as he 
tries to alter their frame of reference. He refuses to let them think that he 
and Barnabas are Greek deities, telling them, “We are human beings just like 
you.” That shared humanity is the common ground. 
●
●Then, Paul shifts the question of healing away from the framework of Greek 
polytheism and toward the idea that there is one God, the living God, who 
is the source of life for all nations. As evidence for such a God, Paul invokes 
the shared experience of rain falling from heaven to make the crops grow for 
people everywhere. In that new framework, healing can be seen as a gift of 
God the Creator. 


The differences between the speeches to a Jewish audience and a Greek audience 
show the complex process of communicating in an interreligious world. People 
interpret events in some frame of reference, and the speeches may either affirm 
or challenge that frame of reference, depending on the perspective they adopt. 
Paul’s Interactions with Gentiles


After their journey, Paul and Barnabas return to Antioch and tell the community 
there about the non-Jews who now believe the message of Jesus. But conflict 

Lecture 30—Paul’s Calling 
205
breaks out when some Jewish Christians insist that the non-Jewish converts 
must be circumcised. 


In around 48 A.D., the church at Antioch sends Paul and Barnabas to discuss 
this issue with the church in Jerusalem. First, the two sides state their positions. 
Paul and Barnabas tell about all the non-Jewish people who have received the 
Christian message. Then, the more conservative Jewish Christians argue that 
these new converts must be circumcised. 


At this point, Peter weighs in on Paul’s side. He reminds the assembly that early 
on, he had welcomed Gentiles into the church. Both Jews and non-Jews have 
the same need for God’s grace. And Peter says that people from both groups 
receive God’s grace through trust or faith. Such faith is transformative. It is the 
way God makes the human heart clean. And if God has already cleansed the 
hearts of these people by evoking faith, then circumcision is not necessary.


Finally, a disciple named James quotes a passage from the book of Amos, which 
refers to God rebuilding the dwelling of David and bringing in non-Jewish 
people. James argues that this is what they are now experiencing. 
Paul’s Interactions with Romans


Next, Paul travels from Jerusalem to Antioch, then west toward Europe. On 
this journey, he takes along a friend named Silas, and they go to the region of 
Macedonia in northern Greece. They stop at the city of Philippi, which Acts 
refers to as a Roman colony. The issue here will be the relationship of Christians 
to Roman tradition.


Things go well for Paul and Silas until they encounter a slave girl who thinks 
she’s helping their cause but isn’t. The girl’s owners denounce Paul as a Jew who 
is advocating customs that are foreign to the Roman way of life. Paul and Silas 
are flogged and put in prison.


The plot takes an even more dramatic turn when an earthquake occurs. 
The doors of the prison are thrown open, and the chains of the prisoners 
miraculously come undone. The jailer is about to kill himself, because he 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
206
assumes the prisoners have escaped and he will be held accountable. But Paul 
and the others have dutifully remained in prison. The jailer is so impressed that 
he, too, becomes a believer and is baptized, along with his household. 


In the morning, the city magistrates agree to let Paul and Silas go free, but now 
Paul turns the tables on them. He announces that he is a Roman citizen, which 
means that his punishment without a proper trial was illegal. Here, his Roman 
citizenship is his point of shared experience with his listeners.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Acts portrays Paul as someone connected to Jewish, Greek, and Roman 
cultures. How does the narrative show him drawing on each of those aspects 
of his identity?
2.	 Acts says that a transformative moment for Paul was his experience of the 
risen Jesus on the road to Damascus. What changed through that experience? 
Are there characteristics of Paul that seem to have remained the same?

LECTURE 31
Paul and the Roman Empire
 W 
hen recounting the life of the apostle Paul, the writer of the New 
Testament’s book of Acts had to consider how Paul and his fellow 
Christians would be perceived by Roman readers. And what these 
readers wanted to know was this: Did the beliefs and practices of the group fit the 
conventional framework of what was acceptable in Roman society, or were they 
subversive and a threat to the established order? In this lecture, we’ll explore three 
aspects of Paul’s character and actions as they are described in Acts: Paul’s message 
about Jesus’s kingship in relation to claims about the emperor, the relationship 
of Paul’s message to the other religious traditions in the empire, and Paul’s 
imprisonment and trials. 
Jesus’s Kingship


We pick up the story of Paul in Acts 17, where he travels from Philippi to the 
city of Thessalonica, a major port and the headquarters of the Roman governor 
in the region. The narrative in Acts depicts a pattern in which Paul begins his 
work in local Jewish communities by going to the synagogue and trying to make 
the case that Jesus is the Messiah who was promised in the Jewish Scriptures. 
Acts says that some members of the synagogue came to believe this, as did some 
Greek men and prominent women. 


But trouble starts when members of the synagogue become alarmed at the 
way Paul is attracting people to his message. They enlist the help of ruffians, 
who vandalize the house where they think Paul and Silas are staying. The 
ruffians tell the city officials that Paul and Silas are turning the world upside-
down by claiming that there is another ruler beside the emperor, a king 
named Jesus. 


Note the irony here. The writer pictures the mob accusing Paul and Silas of 
posing a threat to national security, yet the mob itself is setting the city in an 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
208
uproar. The writer wants us to ask: Who really poses a threat to the social order? 
Is it the disciples, who are simply trying to make a case for their beliefs? Or is it 
their opponents, who claim to be pro-Roman, but who are disturbing the peace 
and attacking innocent people? 


From the writer’s perspective, the opponents are clearly the troublemakers. But 
what makes the issue more complex is that Paul’s message does have a subversive 
aspect. The mob is correct in saying that Paul claims that there is another king 
named Jesus. That means that Jesus’s followers do not give their highest loyalty 
to the emperor or the Roman state. They have a higher loyalty. Does that 
threaten the Roman order or not?
1 Thessalonians


The letter called 1 Thessalonians was composed around 50 A.D. and is Paul’s 
oldest extant letter. It was written to encourage the congregation at Thessalonica 
after Paul had gone on to Athens and, probably, Corinth.


In 1 Thessalonians 1:9, Paul says that the people had turned to God from idols 
and now served the living and true God. That means that the Thessalonian 
Christians had formerly worshipped the gods of Greece and Rome. The issues 
they faced arose after they left that former pattern of worship and accepted the 
message of Jesus. 


Paul responds to the Thessalonian situation by affirming many conventional 
values. In chapter 2, he insists that his own life is characterized by integrity 
and hard work and that he is not spreading the message of Jesus to enrich 
himself. In chapter 4, Paul continues in the same vein, urging the Christians of 
Thessalonica to abide by conventional values, as well. He tells the Thessalonians 
to show respect for family life and not to engage in sexual immorality, to live 
quietly and work with their hands, to love others in the community and to 
behave decently toward outsiders.


In chapter 5, we note a more subversive subtext. Here, Paul emphasizes the 
theme of hope. He envisions a time when those who have died will be raised up 
to life again. His argument is that the Christian message is centered on Jesus, 

Lecture 31—Paul and the Roman Empire 
209
who was crucified yet rose from the dead. That means that those who follow 
Jesus have the hope that they, too, will rise. The subversive element comes in 
Paul’s picture of the event in royal terms.


Also in chapter 5, Paul challenges the idea that the world’s “peace and security” 
are permanent. His language seems to allude to Roman claims to have 
established peace and security on earth that would continue indefinitely. But 
Paul warns that the current order will end. He even depicts the followers of 
Jesus as warriors preparing for battle. Yet the battle is not an armed revolt. 
Instead, Paul says that Jesus’s followers wear faith and love as their body armor. 
They have a helmet of hope. And they refuse to repay evil with evil but seek to 
do good to everyone. 
Paul’s Message and Other Religious 
Traditions


In the last half of Acts 17, Paul is in Athens, which was a center of Greek culture 
and philosophy. Among the philosophers who taught there were Stoics and 
Epicureans. 
●
●Stoic philosophers used the term god for the energy that, in their view, 
pervaded the universe. The Stoics also referred to this divine energy as logos. 
According to the Stoics, people would follow the divine will by using reason 
or logos (logic) in all situations. 
●
●In contrast, the Epicureans argued that the gods lived in a blissful state, far 
removed from the world. The gods did not interfere with human life, and it 
was up to humanity, through philosophy, to achieve the goal of living well.


Acts 17 depicts a scene in which the philosophers engage in debate with Paul, 
but bystanders are confused by Paul’s message. Thus, Paul makes a speech at a 
place called the Areopagus. 


The first step is to establish common ground with the listeners. Paul says that 
he can see that the people of Athens are very religious. Paul takes this impulse 
to worship as his point of departure, but he directs it toward the God that he 
understands to be true.

●He makes a case by appealing to the idea that God made all things, which 
means that people of all nations have a common origin. They owe their 
existence to God. The implication is that people were created by God for 
relationship with God. This is the crucial element. Paul argues that this need 
for relationship is built into the structure of human existence. People search 
for ways in which that relationship can be fulfilled. 
●
●Paul invokes the many forms of religious expression at Athens as evidence 
of that basic human search for God. Instead of quoting from the Jewish 
Scriptures, Paul quotes the Greek poet Aratus, who called human beings 
God’s “offspring.” And he concludes that the proper outcome of this human 
search for God is not to be found in the statues of the gods that humans 
have created. Instead, it occurs when they come to know the God who 
created them. And to enable people to know him, Paul says, God revealed 
his identity and purposes by raising Jesus from the dead. 
Paul’s Imprisonment


In the final section of the story, the writer shows people from both Greek and 
Jewish communities insisting that Paul is a threat to society. The Romans must 
step in and maintain order so that Paul can be given a fair hearing. 


We see the challenges posed by the Greek community in Acts 19. Paul is in the 
city of Ephesus, where the dominant form of worship centered on the goddess 
Artemis. The craftsmen there who sell religious objects to pilgrims see Paul’s 
teachings as a threat. They realize that people who accept Paul’s view of God 
will no longer come to the temple of Artemis, which will mean a loss of their 
income. They insist that Paul is a subversive and stage a public protest in the 
theater, shouting support for Artemis. 


The town clerk appears as the voice of reason in this episode. He points out 
that Paul and his companions have not robbed the temple or blasphemed the 
goddess. If others have a complaint against them, they should follow the due 
process of law and use the court system. At Ephesus, the main threat to the 
social order is not Christian teaching but anti-Christian violence. And the 
writer seeks to show that the adherents of the dominant religious tradition 

Lecture 31—Paul and the Roman Empire 
211
must ensure that those in the minority are treated fairly under the rule 
of law. 


Several chapters later, the charge of subversion is raised again, this time, in 
a Jewish context. At a meeting with leaders of the Christian community 
in Jerusalem, Paul is told that rumors are spreading that he is trying to get 
Jews everywhere to abandon their tradition in favor of joining the Christian 
community. To counter that impression, these leaders ask Paul to make 
a public display of obedience to Jewish law. He agrees and goes through a 
ritual of purification that eventually takes him to the temple. That is where the 
conflict explodes. 
●
●Members of the Jewish community assume that Paul has brought non-
Jews into the temple, which was forbidden. Opposition against him turns 
violent, and the Roman forces quickly intervene, seizing Paul. Paul is given 
a hearing in Jerusalem, then taken to the city of Caesarea for additional 
hearings; each time, he insists that he is not guilty of the charges made 
against him. 
●
●For example, in chapter 24, Paul is brought before the Roman governor. 
During the hearing, the prosecuting attorney accuses Paul of fomenting 
social unrest and violating the sanctity of the Jerusalem temple. But Paul 
denies the charges. He insists that he worships the God of Israel, adheres to 
the Jewish Scriptures, and believes in the resurrection of the dead—just as 
many other Jews do. 
●
●Paul remains in prison in Caesarea for two years. When a new governor 
arrives, Paul’s opponents repeat the charges against him, but Paul demands 
that his case be brought directly to the emperor—his right as a Roman citizen. 


In chapter 27, Paul is placed on a ship with a Roman guard. After a shipwreck, 
he ultimately reaches Rome, where the story ends, leaving Paul under house 
arrest and waiting for a hearing with the emperor. Later sources say that Paul 
was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Nero, sometime in the mid-60s of 
the 1st century.

The stories of Paul’s 
martyrdom inform later 
artistic portrayals of him 
holding a sword; the sword 
not only recalls his death 
by beheading but also 
symbolizes the militant 
power of his message.

LECTURE 32
Paul’s Letters to a Community 
in Conflict
 I 
n this lecture, we’ll focus on two letters of the apostle Paul that appear in the 
New Testament as 1 and 2 Corinthians. Both were written to the Christians 
at Corinth in the mid-50s of the 1st century, each dealing with the challenge 
of creating and maintaining a community. Paul lived in Corinth for about a year 
and a half and worked as a tentmaker there. Together with his associates Aquila, 
Priscilla, and Apollos, he later worked in Ephesus, although he continued to stay 
in touch with the community at Corinth. We’ll look at four issues dealt with in the 
letters: the cross, Spirit, resurrection, and reconciliation.
The Cross


In the middle of 1 Corinthians 1, Paul says that he has received oral reports 
about conflict in the congregation. He has heard that various groups there each 
identify with a particular church leader. To portray the situation, Paul mimics 
the different groups: “I belong to Paul,” “I belong to Apollos,” “I belong to 
Cephas [Peter],” and “I belong to Christ.” As Paul portrays it, the Corinthians 
had turned Christ into someone associated with a particular faction, rather than 
the unifying center of the congregation. 


In Paul’s eyes, the community’s fragmentation reflects misplaced loyalties. He 
wants the readers to see that Paul, Apollos, and Cephas are the bearers of a 
message, but none of them can be the focus of the community’s identity. He 
insists that Christ must be the focus, because it is through the message of Christ 
that God calls them to faith. 


Paul’s argument is that neither he nor the others could bring anyone to faith 
through their preaching. He reminds the Corinthians that his message was 
about God bringing salvation through the crucified Jesus. Such an idea might 

Lecture 32—Paul’s Letters to a Community in Conflict 
215
strike some people as incongruous, even repulsive. But if the Corinthians were 
persuaded by it, it had nothing to do with Paul’s rhetorical powers. 


Paul assumes that people in the ancient world could see that undergoing 
crucifixion was the antithesis of power. He presses this idea in 1 Corinthians, 
when he says that the message of the cross is foolishness. From an ordinary 
point of view, it was foolish to claim that God’s power to save people was 
revealed through the crucifixion of Jesus. 
●
●Paul says that for Jews, this idea would be scandalous. For example, 
Deuteronomy says a person hung on the tree (the cross) is under God’s curse. 
●
●Paul also says that for Greeks, it would be absurd to see the cross as a channel 
of divine power. Unlike the temples to Apollo and Aphrodite at Corinth, the 
cross was an appalling symbol. And that’s Paul’s point. He as a speaker could 
not have won the Corinthians’ loyalty by bringing a message about crucifixion. 
As we read the 
letters of Paul, we 
get insights into 
his thoughts, the 
concerns of the 
people with whom 
he corresponded, and 
the society in which 
they lived. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
216


For Paul, the cross conveys the extremity of divine love. If love is shown by 
giving and if the greatest gift one can give is one’s life, then the crucifixion shows 
God in the act of utmost self-giving. Crucifixion does not follow conventional 
patterns of equating love with beauty or romantic ideals. Conveying love 
through crucifixion shows a willingness to give up dignity, status, and life itself 
for the sake of another. That is how crucifixion reveals divine love—by revealing 
the extent to which God gives himself to restore relationships with humans. 


By ordinary human standards, the message of the cross was repugnant. It should 
have turned people away. Thus, the fact that the Corinthians had been drawn 
to God through it is astonishing. Paul insists that neither he nor Apollos nor 
Cephas can take credit for the Corinthians’ faith. And that means that none of 
them can have the central place in the community. The unifying center of the 
congregation must be Christ. 
The Spirit


Another issue that concerned the Christians at Corinth was “spiritual things.” 
This issue posed similar questions as it does today: Is spirituality necessarily 
linked to a religious tradition, or can it be understood as something more private?


As in our time, there were some in Corinth who felt that God’s Spirit inspired 
them to speak with ecstatic words or utter prophetic messages. Yet there were 
still others who did not have these spiritual experiences, and that created 
tension, because some thought that spiritual experiences gave them a higher 
status in the community. 


Paul responds by telling them that they can’t discern the presence of God’s Spirit 
simply by looking for emotional intensity. Instead, the principal manifestation 
of the Spirit’s work is faith, and faith is what everyone in the congregation has 
in common. 
●
●Paul’s assumption is that faith is a relationship of trust. It’s a sense of trust 
in God that comes about through an encounter with God—and that’s where 
the Spirit comes in. We’ve seen that Paul told the Corinthians about the self-
sacrificing love of God being conveyed through the crucified man named Jesus. 
And he acknowledged that words alone could not make them believe this. 

Lecture 32—Paul’s Letters to a Community in Conflict 
217
●
●For there to be genuine trust, God needed to be present through the Spirit, 
giving people the sense that what was being said was true. For Paul, this is 
a hallmark of the Spirit. When the message of Jesus rings true for someone, 
there, the Spirit of God is at work. 


Beyond that, Paul says, the Spirit might do different things, and different spiritual 
gifts were supposed to build up the community, not tear it apart. As examples, he 
says that God’s Spirit can empower people to share wisdom and knowledge, to 
heal and work miracles. For some, it can take the form of ecstatic speech. But he 
insists that people cannot expect uniformity in these gifts and experiences. 


To emphasize his point, Paul insists that love is the measure of each person’s 
role. In 1 Corinthians 13, he writes: “If I can prophesy and understand all 
mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, 
but do not have love, I am nothing.” He goes on to say that love is patient and 
kind, it is not jealous or boastful, and endures all things. 


In the face of tension over different spiritual experiences, Paul puts love at the 
center because he understands that self-sacrificing love characterizes God himself. 
For Paul, prophesying and speaking in tongues are of value, but they are not 
of ultimate value. Prophesying and speaking in tongues eventually will end, but 
love endures because God endures. Love has abiding value. And all the different 
spiritual gifts the community receives should rightly be used in the service of love. 
Paul on Resurrection


At the end of 1 Corinthians, Paul takes up a different question that was disputed 
at Corinth: the question of death and the nature of hope. Of course, people in 
every culture have different ways of coming to terms with death, ranging from 
continued life in an underworld to nothingness. 


One distinctive idea of death that was favored by some Jewish groups was 
resurrection—the idea that people remained in the realm of the dead until the 
end of the present age; then, they would be raised to life again as a group. Some 
expected resurrection to bring about a restoration of bodily life; others thought 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
218
of resurrection as a transformed existence, when those who were raised would 
shine like stars. 


In this mix of ideas, the Christians at Corinth debated what they could hope 
for. And in chapter 15, Paul responds. The lens through which he sees things is 
the story of Jesus. And for him, the heart of the story is that Jesus died and rose. 
For Paul, then, if Jesus died and was raised as a whole person, then others who 
die will also be raised to life as whole people.


Paul pictures the present time as one of struggle, in which God’s power to give 
life is battling the forces of death. For Paul, death is not merely the moment 
at which a person takes a final breath. It’s the power that brings people to that 
final breath. Death is operative in diseases, violence, and hunger. The message 
of Jesus’s resurrection is about God’s commitment to continue the battle until 
death itself is overcome by the sheer power of life.


Paul further argues that resurrection of the body means transformation of 
the body—bringing the person who died into a new mode of existence. His 
assumption is that God creates the whole person and that God has a future for 
the whole person. God’s goal is not to strip away a portion of a person’s existence 
by destroying the body and saving the soul. Rather, the goal is to transform the 
whole person, the embodied person, by clothing that person with life. 
Reconciliation


After Paul sent this letter, he made another journey to Corinth to visit the 
congregation, but someone made some cutting remarks about him, and he ended 
up leaving with a profound sense of hurt. He was unsure about whether he should 
visit the congregation again in person. Thus, he wrote the letter called 2 Corinthians 
to deal with the situation. A major theme here is the renewal of relationship. 


Paul sets the tone in the opening chapter, where he refers to God giving people 
paráklēsis, that is, comfort, consolation, or encouragement. The idea is that the 
comfort or encouragement that God gives to Paul and the Corinthians, they 
can, in turn, give to each other. Those opening lines are a signal that Paul wants 
to rebuild the damaged relationship. 

Lecture 32—Paul’s Letters to a Community in Conflict 
219


In chapter 2, he refers to the painful visit that had occurred, but he does not 
want the past to define the future. Paul is grateful that those in Corinth took 
the situation seriously, confronting the person who made the cutting remarks, 
but he also knows that more needs to be done to bring healing. Thus, he urges 
forgiveness. He understands that if what was done in the past determines 
the future, then there is no future. The damage persists. In the face of that, 
forgiveness offers the prospect of renewed relationship. 


In chapter 4, Paul speaks of this message of renewal as the treasure people have 
received from God. Yet he pictures that treasure being held by human beings, 
who are like jars made of clay—fragile and breakable. 
●
●As we read Paul’s letters, we are confronted repeatedly with human beings 
who are as fallible as clay jars. That meant that community could never 
be created once and for all. There were misplaced loyalties, disputes over 
spiritual experiences, and questions about the meaning of death itself. 
●
●For this reason, Paul understood that community must be created and re-
created. It is a dynamic, ongoing process. At the end of 2 Corinthians 5, he 
describes it as the ministry of reconciliation.

what extent did Paul challenge the perspectives of his readers? To what extent 
did he affirm their perspectives? How are perspectives on spiritual things 
today similar to or different from those reflected in 1 Corinthians?
2.	 The lecture summarized some of the ancient perspectives on death and 
the afterlife. How was Paul’s perspective similar to and different from

LECTURE 33
Freedom and the Law in Paul’s 
Letters
 I 
n this lecture, we turn to Paul’s letters to the Galatians and the Romans, 
which are concerned with issues of freedom and law. In Paul’s context, the 
question of freedom had to do with the significance of the message about 
Jesus. He understood that the message opened up a new relationship with God 
and brought people into a community that shared a common faith. For Paul, all 
that was liberating, but it also raised issues that were not easy to resolve, including 
conflict within Christian communities and how people would direct their lives. A 
related question was whether that directing would be done by the Jewish law. Paul’s 
letters to the Galatians and Romans address these issues.
The Question of Faith


The letter to the Galatians was written for a number of congregations that were 
founded by Paul in what today is central Turkey. These people were not of 
Jewish background. Their religious beliefs included elements from the Celtic, 
Greek, and Roman traditions. But some of them accepted Paul’s message and 
formed Christian communities.


After Paul left the area, issues arose when traveling preachers arrived. These 
visitors were Jewish Christians, who told the Galatians that to fully embrace 
the Christian faith, they must follow the Law of Moses. The men had to be 
circumcised, and they were to adopt such practices as eating kosher food and 
observing Jewish holidays. Against this background, Paul was prompted to write 
a letter to the Galatians.


In Galatians 1, Paul recounts how his worldview was reshaped through his 
experience of Jesus. His faith now centered on the conviction that through 
Jesus, God was restoring relationships with people. In chapter 2, he recalls the 
conference in Jerusalem, where he and other leaders agreed that the message of 

Lecture 33—Freedom and the Law in Paul’s Letters 
221
Jesus was the central feature of life in the church for both Jews and non-Jews. And 
they agreed that given the centrality of that message, it was not necessary for non-
Jewish Christians to become circumcised. The shared faith was what mattered. 


In Galatians, Paul mentions an incident that happened afterward, when 
Peter visited the church at Antioch, which included Christians of Jewish and 
non-Jewish backgrounds. When it came time to eat, the groups went their 
separate ways, assuming that those who did not keep kosher could not eat 
with those who did. For Paul, that was a problem. These people shared a 
common faith yet were divided by the laws about kosher food. Paul put the 
question sharply: What defined life in the community? Was it faith in Jesus, 
or was it Jewish law? 


At the end of chapter 2, Paul states his position in a provocative way. He says 
that people are justified by faith in Christ, not by the law. Therefore, they live by 
faith in Christ, not by the law. For Paul, faith is the definitive element. 


For Paul, the basic problem in human life is sin. Sin is a relationship that 
has gone wrong; it is a kind of estrangement or alienation. And Paul assumes 
that where there is alienation, it will be expressed in actions, which may 
range from deception and hurtful speech to theft and violence. But all these 
particular “sins” reflect the underlying problem of alienation from God and 
other people. 


If sin is a relationship that has gone wrong, then faith is the relationship set 
right—that is, justified. Paul can say that people are justified by faith because 
faith straightens out the relationship that has been warped by mistrust. Paul 
ascribes this justifying or straightening out to the grace of God. 
Jewish Law


Another question was the status of Jewish law in the Christian community. 
After all, Paul understood that the God who acted through Jesus was Israel’s 
God, and Israel’s God was the giver of the law. If the law said that people should 
be circumcised and keep kosher, why would Paul think that Christians are free 
to do otherwise? 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
222


In chapter 3, Paul responds that the answer has to do with two things: people’s 
experience and Scripture. 
●
●In terms of experience, Paul observes that the Galatians were not of Jewish 
background. Yet as they heard the message of Jesus, the Spirit of God was at 
work, drawing them to faith. They did not have to be circumcised in order 
to start believing the message; thus, Paul can’t see why they would need to be 
circumcised after they believed the message. 
●
●Then Paul says that living by faith—without circumcision—makes sense 
in terms of the Scriptures. He recalls that according to the book of Genesis, 
God made a promise that through Abraham, people from all nations of 
the earth would be blessed. Those nations included non-Jewish peoples. 
When the non-Jewish Galatians were blessed by being drawn into faith 
through the message of Jesus, they received the blessing that was promised 
to Abraham.


Concerning the rest of the Jewish law, Paul said that its role was to protect 
and restrain. However, the role of the law is limited. At some point, people of 
Paul repeatedly refers 
to passages from 
the law and the 
prophetic writings 
when interpreting the 
significance of Jesus; he 
finds a deep congruence 
between the Torah 
and the gospel in the 
importance of showing 
love to one’s neighbor.

Lecture 33—Freedom and the Law in Paul’s Letters 
223
faith no longer require the supervision of the law because love itself includes an 
element of restraint. If you love someone, you restrain your own impulses and 
do what is needed for the well-being of the other. 
Freedom


Galatians 3:28 is one of the most famous verses in the letter. Here, Paul says 
that in Christ, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, nor is there male 
and female.” And now that these dividing lines are gone, everyone is free, as 
Paul put it, to live as a slave out of love. 


In Galatians 5:1, Paul writes, “For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand fast, 
therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.” Then, a few verses 
later, he insists that freedom cannot be self-serving. In verse 13, he says that 
people are free to become slaves to one another. They are liberated in order 
to serve.


Surprisingly, Paul is advocating a pattern of life that is not based on Jewish 
law, yet he finds it consistent with Jewish law in its deepest sense. Life in the 
new community does not follow traditional Jewish patterns, because it does 
not include being circumcised and keeping kosher. Yet Paul points out that 
the heart of Jewish law is to love your neighbor as yourself. That is what the 
message of Jesus moves people to do: It frees them to live out their love in 
service to others. 


For the Galatians, this would have been a paradigm shift. In the standard 
patterns of Greek culture, freedom and slavery were opposite categories. Yet in 
this letter, Paul brings the categories together. 
●
●He says that the true signs of slavery are giving in to the forces that destroy 
community, and the real threat to freedom comes from such things as 
immorality, jealousy, and anger. Those traits do not express freedom. Instead, 
they show that people are held captive by their own desires. 
●
●For Paul, true freedom is expressed in love, joy, peace, patience, and 
kindness, all of which promote community. That is the fruit of God’s Spirit, 
which frees people for love and service to others. For Paul, that illustrates 
what it means to live by faith. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
224
Letter to the Romans


Paul wrote to the Romans in the mid to late 50s of the 1st century. By that 
time, there were a number of Christian congregations in the city with 
members of both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds. Paul never visited these 
congregations, but he wrote a letter conveying his understanding of the faith for 
this multi-ethnic readership. 


In Romans 1:16–17, Paul says that the gospel is “the power of God for salvation 
to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the 
righteousness of God is revealed.” Paul centers his message on God’s righteousness. 


Paul focuses on the God of Israel—the God who had freed the people from slavery 
and sent the prophets. He insists that this same God has now acted to set things 
right through Jesus, who was Jewish. Then Paul adds that the message is also for 
people of non-Jewish background. The idea that God seeks to make relationships 
right with everyone, on the same basis, is the central point of this section.


In chapters 1 to 5, Paul argues that God deals with everyone on the same basis 
because all have the same need. Paul tries to show the degree of commonality 
among people of various backgrounds. He gives examples of wrongdoing 
ranging from murder to greed—acts that are not limited to Jews or Greeks but 
are part of the human condition. 


Paul says that all acts of wrongdoing reveal the same underlying condition: All 
have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Paul wants readers to see that 
imperfection is something they have in common with all other humans. For 
this reason, God extends salvation to everyone on the same basis. God wants 
his relationship with all people to be set right. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus 
conveys God’s refusal to let human failings set the terms for relationship. It 
shows God’s freedom to act in love toward the people estranged from him. 
Conflict and Reconciliation


Paul notes that in his experience, the message of Jesus brought not only 
reconciliation but conflict, especially conflict within the Jewish community. As 
he turns to this problem, Paul shifts the issue from the human to the divine 

Lecture 33—Freedom and the Law in Paul’s Letters 
225
level—from the question of who believes the message and who does not to 
the question of what God is doing in this conflicted situation. His central 
conviction is that God refuses to let human resistance define the future. God is 
free to work in other ways, and as he does so, he will be true to his commitment 
to bring reconciliation. 


Paul’s experience was that some in the Jewish community rejected the message, but 
he and others extended the message to outsiders. And Paul understood that when 
these non-Jews believed the message of Jesus, they came to believe in the God of 
Israel, because through Jesus, the God of Israel was working to set things right. 
When non-Jews came to faith in Israel’s God, they shared in Israel’s tradition. 


Paul knows that differences remain between those who accept the message of 
Jesus and those who do not. But he remains convinced that human conflict in 
the present does not limit God’s action for the future. Earlier, Paul insisted that 
God was at work to reconcile those who were estranged from him. Because that 
was God’s purpose in the past, Paul is convinced it will be God’s purpose in the 
future. If God is true to his own commitments, then conflict and estrangement 
cannot have the final word.

LECTURE 34
Paul on Gender Roles and 
Slavery
 I 
n the last lecture, we noted that Paul’s letter to the Galatians included a 
striking description of the Christian community. Paul said that in Christ, 
“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, nor is there male and female.” 
It’s a remarkable idea, but one that also raises questions about what that might 
mean in practice. In the last lecture, we looked further at what Paul said about Jews 
and Greeks in his letter to the Romans. In this lecture, we’ll consider what he says 
about slaves and free people and about males and females in four additional letters: 
Philippians, Philemon, Ephesians, and 1Timothy. 
Philippians


The book of Acts recounted Paul’s arrest in the city of Philippi, where he 
was accused of undermining Roman tradition. After his release, however, he 
maintained good relations with the congregation at Philippi. At the time of 
Philippians, he is a prisoner again, though it is not clear whether he is in Rome 
or some other city.


Paul’s opening line in Philippians raises the question of social class. He refers 
to himself and to his associate Timothy as “slaves” of Jesus. To some extent, it 
makes sense for Paul to describe himself as a slave. After all, he is in prison and 
could be executed. In a real sense, then, Paul is like a slave. He no longer has the 
freedom to lead his own life. 


In chapter 2, Paul goes on to say that the term slave characterizes the Christian 
community. We also saw this idea in Galatians. There, Paul wrote of the paradox 
that Jesus brought people freedom, but his followers lived out that freedom in 
relationship. He said that as free people, they serve others as slaves out of love. 
In Philippians, he grounds that idea on the way in which Christ renounced his 
own high status to serve others. 

Lecture 34—Paul on Gender Roles and Slavery 
227


Paul uses language that is vivid and graceful, possibly quoting a song or poem. 
The poem traces an arc in which Christ moves from a high point to a low point 
and back up again. 
●
●At the outset—the high point—Christ was in the form of God. In the 
downward movement, Christ emptied himself and let go of his status. He 
took on the form of a slave and was born as a human being. The low point 
occurred when he became obedient to the point of death, giving up his life 
through crucifixion. 
●
●Only then does the upward movement take place again, as God elevates 
Jesus to glory through resurrection. 


Paul says that his own life had a similar pattern. In chapter 3, he notes that 
he once had high status as a Pharisee. Then, the downward movement began 
when Paul became a follower of Jesus. He let go of a sense of identity that was 
based on heritage and achievement—what he believed gave him status—to live 
out a relationship that he was convinced had true value. And Paul said that he, 
too, could move from death into life through resurrection, just as Jesus had 
done. This perspective enables him to move through the experience of loss in 
the conviction that it does not define his future.


In chapter 3, Paul also gives us a glimpse into gender roles in the church at 
Philippi. He speaks of two women, Eudoia and Syntyche, who had striven 
beside him in the work of the gospel. This idea of a close partnership between 
women and men in Christian communities was typical for Paul. 
Philemon


Philemon is a letter addressed to a slave owner of that name. Because Paul had 
apparently introduced Philemon to the Christian faith, there was a significant 
bond between the two. In prison, Paul met a slave named Onesimus, who 
belonged to Philemon and had also become a Christian. It’s possible that 
Onesimus had come to Paul for help concerning some problem with his master.


The letter reframes the relationship between master and slave in the context of 
Christian community. Instead of saying that Philemon should set Onesimus 
free, Paul uses the paradigm of family relationships. Given that both master and 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
228
slave are Christians, Paul wants Philemon to receive Onesimus back “no longer 
as a slave but … as a beloved brother.” The idea here is that in community, 
people are not free to be autonomous because freedom takes the form of new 
relationship. Instead of relating to Onesimus as a slave, Philemon is to relate to 
him as a brother. 
●
●Family ties were a principal source of identity and belonging in the ancient 
world. In addition, people were obliged to look out for the interests of others 
in their families, and they counted on family members for support. 
●
●To underscore the gravity of his message, Paul adds that Philemon is to 
welcome Onesimus as he would welcome Paul himself. And throughout the 
letter, Paul says that Philemon is his brother, too. Thus, Philemon should 
treat Onesimus and Paul in the same way. Paul concludes by saying he is 
confident that Philemon will do even more than he has asked.
Ephesians


If the perspective in Philemon is immediate and personal, the outlook in 
Ephesians is cosmic. It begins with an expansive statement of praise to God, 
whose grace unfolds throughout the ages. Chapter 1 says that before the world 
was even created, God developed a plan to bring salvation. And now, in the 
fullness of time, that plan was carried out through Jesus Christ and the church. 


A central concept in the letter is God’s desire to bring unity among all things 
in heaven and on earth in Jesus. In chapter 2, the writer relates the theme of 
unity to the divisions that had separated Jews and Gentiles. He says that Jews 
had citizenship in Israel, whereas Gentiles were foreigners or aliens to it. He 
compares the differences to a stone wall that divided the two groups. But the 
writer says that the wall of hostility has now been broken down. The Gentiles, 
who once were foreigners, can become citizens among the people of God. 


Ephesians considers the relationship of husbands and wives in chapter 5. 
Ancient writers frequently stressed the importance of harmony within marriage; 
at the same time, these writers generally assumed that the husband was the head 
of the household. 
●
●Ephesians 5:21 reads, “Be subject to one another out of reverence for 
Christ,” making the relationship seem mutual. People are to be subject to 

Lecture 34—Paul on Gender Roles and Slavery 
229
one another by serving one another. But then, the letter says that wives are 
to be subject to their husbands as they are to Christ. The husband is the head 
of the wife as Christ is the head of the church. Picturing the husband as the 
head certainly alters the sense of mutuality.
●
●Yet the writer also says that husbands are to love their wives as Christ 
loved the church and gave himself up for her. The trait of a husband is not 
domination but self-giving. That is the aspect of Christ that husbands are to 
emulate. They are to love, nourish, and care for their wives as Christ does for 
the church. 


In chapter 6, the writer tells slaves to obey their earthly masters as they obey 
Christ. Thus, it seems clear that the writer does not challenge slavery as an 
institution, yet the passage counters certain stereotypes about slaves. Rather 
than toadies or thieves, Ephesians treats slaves as responsible human beings, 
whose primary loyalty is to Christ. And the letter tells masters to treat their 
slaves in the same way.
The idea of Jesus as lord over all 
things is reflected in the icons 
developed by the Eastern Orthodox 
churches, which often picture a 
majestic Christ enthroned.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
230
1 Timothy


The style and outlook of 1 Timothy is somewhat different from Paul’s earlier 
letters, and many scholars think it was written one or two generations after Paul. 
In chapter 1, the writer is concerned about false teachings, which are eroding 
the fabric of the church. He responds by emphasizing the need for structure and 
order, which come through church leadership. 


In chapter 3, the writer focuses on the roles of bishop and deacon. He assumes 
that leaders of the church should be leaders in their own households and that 
the head of a household should be stable, sensible, and hospitable. 


Along with this concern for good order, 1 Timothy includes comments about 
women that are problematic. In chapter 2, the writer says that women are 
to learn in silence. They are not to teach or to have authority over men. As a 
rationale for this thinking, the writer goes back to the book of Genesis, in which 
Adam was created before Eve. 
Reading the Bible Responsibly


Such passages seem to conflict with other parts of the Bible, and reading 
responsible means taking these conflicts seriously. The letter of 1 Timothy 
appeals to the creation stories in Genesis as a basis for a hierarchy of men over 
women, but many people find in Genesis the idea that both men and women 
were created in the image of God—with no hierarchy. 


Similar tensions are apparent in other writings we’ve considered in this lecture. 
The writer of 1 Timothy insists that women are not to teach, yet in Philippians 
and Romans, Paul is appreciative of women who were not silent, such as 
the teacher Priscilla and the apostle Junia. It’s clear that women had strong 
leadership roles among the early Christians.


When reading these passages, we have to ask what is central and what is not. For 
Paul, a central idea is stated in Galatians 3, where he centered Christian identity 
in faith and baptism. And he said that in Christ, distinctions fade between Jews 
and Greeks, slaves and free, and males and females. Other passages that speak 

Lecture 34—Paul on Gender Roles and Slavery 
231
of mutual respect, mutual service, and mutual leadership seem consistent with 
that. But a passage that subjects women to men does not.


The same is true for the issue of slavery. There are texts in both the Old and 
New Testaments that take slavery as a given. They might advocate for humane 
treatment of slaves, but they do not challenge slavery as an institution. But in 
the Old Testament, God delivered people out of slavery, and in Galatians, Paul 
says that in Christ, there is no longer slave or free.


As we’ve seen, in the New Testament, we encounter multiple sides of Paul. In 
the letters, he speaks with harshness about the scandal of Jesus’s crucifixion, then 
waxes eloquent about the character of Christian love. He was sharply critical 
of his opponents yet impassioned about the need for reconciliation. Those 
who work deeply with Paul’s writings find themselves outraged and intrigued, 
affirmed and provoked. It is hard to remain neutral about his work. And that is 
perhaps why we continue to read it.

LECTURE 35
Letters for Sojourners
 A 
common thread connects the letters of the New Testament known as 
Hebrews, James, and 1 Peter: They portray their readers as sojourners or 
resident aliens. Written not by Paul but by other early Christian writers, 
these letters address people who have a sense of dislocation—people who live in 
society but are not fully integrated into it. This social dislocation largely stemmed 
from religious beliefs that differed from Judaism and from Roman religious 
practices. The letters we’ll consider here speak to that issue in different ways. The 
letter to the Hebrews calls on early Christians to keep the faith. The letter of James 
emphasizes integrity, and 1 Peter asks what belonging really means. 
Letter to the Hebrews


Somewhat surprisingly, Hebrews lacks the usual features of a letter. Instead of a 
greeting, for example, it begins, “At many times and in many ways, God spoke 
in the past to our ancestors through the prophets. But now in these last days 
God has spoken to us by a Son.” Scholars often refer to Hebrews as a speech 
because its introduction sounds like a piece of oratory.


The writer never tells us his name, but at points in the speech, he tells us 
something about his readers. In chapter 2, he recalls that initially receiving 
the Christian message was a spiritual highpoint for these readers. The power 
of God and the Spirit of God seemed vivid. But after the initial highpoint, 
they experienced harassment. They were verbally abused and occasionally 
imprisoned. Yet they rallied and supported one another—at least for a time. 


Then, the sense of solidarity faded. The early Christians became discouraged, 
and some began to drift away. They initially found the Christian message to 
be inspiring, but soon, they felt marginalized in their own society. In their 
experience, this was not a new age of peace and harmony. It might be better to 
let go of the faith altogether.

Lecture 35—Letters for Sojourners 
233


In response, the writer uses three sets of images to redefine the way these 
Christians see their situation. Each set of images helps move them through the 
discouraging situation of the present toward the future. 
●
●The first set of images recalls the story of Moses leading the Hebrew people 
through the desert. The writer tells their story as one that had a beginning 
point (liberation from slavery) and a goal (the Promised Land). In between 
was the journey through the desert. The writer of Hebrews wants readers to 
see themselves in a similar situation. They are in a social wilderness and are 
in danger of giving up, but the promise of life remains.
●
●In the middle of the book, the writer shifts the imagery. He now portrays 
Jesus as a priest and the letter’s readers as people who feel excluded from 
worship. They seek access to the presence of God, but they feel that way 
is closed. Christians seem to have no place in the religious culture of the 
empire. The writer of Hebrews, however, says that readers have a high priest 
in Jesus, and that transforms the way they see their situation. Like Jewish 
priests, Jesus makes a sacrifice, but his is a self-sacrifice of the highest order, 
creating a new bond between God and humans.
●
●In the final part of Hebrews, the writer traces a journey from the dawn of 
creation, through the history of Israel, to the readers’ own situation. He 
highlights moments when people of the past had to keep the faith, even 
People in the 1st 
century were avid 
sports fan, and they 
placed a high value on 
athletes who faithfully 
endured the struggle 
of the race; the writer 
of Hebrews pictures 
early Christians in 
the position of those 
athletes (stadium at 
Delphi).

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
234
when everything they could see called it into question. The author uses 
athletic imagery to redefine the way the readers see themselves. They feel 
discouraged, but the author describes a stadium in which they are running, 
filled with witnesses from the past who kept the faith. The readers are 
engaged in a contest in which the goal is not speed but perseverance. It’s a 
summons to keep the faith. 
Letter of James


According to tradition, James was the brother of Jesus. He was a leader of the 
church in Jerusalem and was martyred during the 60s of the 1st century. Today, 
some interpreters continue to think that James wrote the letter attributed to 
him, while others think the author’s identity is unknown. 


What’s more important for us is the way the author portrays the readers. He 
addresses Christians, but he refers to them as the 12 tribes of Israel. And he 
pictures them living in dispersion. This term was used for the people of Israel 
who lived outside their traditional homeland. Over the generations, some had 
been refugees of war; other had been exiled or had migrated. Portraying the 
followers of Jesus as people in dispersion suggests that socially, they felt scattered 
and out of place. 


To address these readers, the writer offers advice on how to live, and for James, 
the central question concerns integrity— defined as the consistency of actions 
with beliefs. For example, in James 1:22, the author urges, “Be doers of the 
word, and not merely hearers, who aren’t being honest with themselves.” The 
writer insists that it’s not enough simply to have the right ideas. If the ideas 
matter, then we need to live them out. 


Further, James connects this broadly held value with a central element in the 
biblical tradition: to love one’s neighbor as oneself. In chapters 1 and 2, James 
refers to acting in love toward one’s neighbor as the perfect law, and he uses it as 
a criterion for integrity. 


In chapter 2, James applies that criterion to the issue of social class. The writer 
pictures a scene in which a group of Christians has gathered, and two people show 

Lecture 35—Letters for Sojourners 
235
up at the door. One is well dressed in fine clothes with fancy jewelry. The other is 
poor and dirty and wearing shabby clothes. How should the visitors be treated? 
●
●This simple question points to a clash in value systems. Social convention 
would say that wealth usually warrants privilege. The wealthy person should 
be invited to take a comfortable seat at the gathering, while the person in 
rags would stand by the door or sit on the floor. 
●
●But James asks how that common practice fits the fundamental conviction 
of loving one’s neighbor as oneself. He insists that in God’s eyes, the poor 
person has value. The writer goes on to say that there is nothing inherently 
virtuous about being wealthy. 
●
●James highlights the difference between the two systems of value. On the one 
hand, social convention assumes that the wealthy are worthy of higher honor 
than the poor. On the other hand, the command to love one’s neighbor 
eliminates the idea that a person’s value can be equated with social class. 
James challenges readers to put their belief into practice, even when it runs 
counter to social conventions. Doing so is what integrity requires. 


At this point, the writer of James takes issue with a certain understanding of 
Paul’s ideas. 
●
●In the letter to the Galatians, Paul argued that people are set in right 
relationship with God by faith, not by doing what the law requires. He used 
the example of Abraham as a person of faith. 
●
●James assumes that some readers thought Paul’s message was that all that 
counts is having the right beliefs—actions are not important. James makes 
a sharp critique of that idea, arguing that faith without works is dead. You 
can have all the right beliefs about God, but if belief does not lead to action, 
then it is lifeless. James uses Abraham as a clear example of someone who put 
faith into practice. 


Both James and Paul insist that faith rightly takes the form of action, and both 
agree that saying one thing and doing something else shows a lack of integrity. 
But there is also tension between these writers because their concerns are not 
exactly the same. To read Paul’s emphasis on the relational aspect of faith 
alongside James’s emphasis on the ethical implications helps ensure that we keep 
both dimensions in mind. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
236
In the 16th century, Martin 
Luther believed that James 
lacked substance, while 
Paul was the superior 
theologian; others have 
tried to even out this claim.

Lecture 35—Letters for Sojourners 
237
1 Peter


Scholars disagree over whether 1 Peter was written by the apostle Peter or by 
someone else in his name. The letter is addressed to Christians in Asia Minor, 
who had once been members of Greco-Roman society but had joined the 
Christian community. 


The opening line of 1 Peter addresses these readers as sojourners or resident 
aliens. They have sometimes been verbally abused and treated as outsiders in 
mainstream society. Peter responds with an affirmation of belonging. He says 
that these resident aliens have been chosen by God, belong to God, and are 
valued by God. They have also been given new birth into a living hope through 
the message of Jesus’s resurrection. That image of new birth refers to them 
coming to faith and indicates belonging. It’s a way of saying that in faith, they 
have received a place in the family. 


Peter goes on to say that they have an inheritance that comes from God. When 
New Testament scholars read these lines, they sometimes point out that a sense 
of belonging is a major factor in identity, but the readers of 1 Peter lived in 
a context where much of the public approval had been withdrawn. They felt 
pressured to give up their faith. Peter counters by appealing to a higher authority. 
Given that God’s opinion is what matters, Christians have an incentive to hold 
on to their identity in the face of pressure to relinquish it.


Earlier, we saw that the writer of Hebrews identified Jesus as a priest, but 1 
Peter refers to the followers of Jesus as priests. On public occasions, priests had 
the honor of offering prayers, incense, and other sacrifices. In this book, Peter 
ascribes that same honor to his readers, whose sacrifices are the words of praise 
they offer to God, as well as their acts of righteous conduct in ordinary life. 


The writer also knows that belonging to the community has a downside. Some 
are suffering verbal abuse from their former friends and associates. Others are 
slaves, whose masters might be harsh. And many women are married to men 
who do not share their beliefs. In each case, Peter urges them not to respond to 
abuse with abuse. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
238
●
●The idea is to show others that instead of adopting the patterns of hatred 
around them, Christians are to resist and show a higher commitment to 
doing what is right. 
●
●The author understands that in itself, suffering is not a virtue or an 
appropriate goal. Instead, the point is to be true to one’s convictions despite 
suffering, because that is what it means to follow in the steps of Christ.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Hebrews portrays Jesus as high priest. Why might the readers have found 
this a meaningful way to understand Jesus’s role? At the same time, 1 Peter 
portrays the members of the Christian community as a holy priesthood. 
Why might they have found that a meaningful way to understand their role?
2.	 James emphasizes the need for readers’ actions to be consistent with their 
beliefs. Why was this an important issue for him?

LECTURE 36
Revelation’s Vision of New 
Creation
 R 
evelation was written in the last part of the 1st century by someone 
named John, probably not John the apostle. This writer used a familiar 
literary genre—an apocalypse, which was a kind of narrative with an 
expansive setting. An apocalypse could take readers from the heights of heaven to 
the far reaches of earth and even to the gates of the underworld, from the present to 
the past and into the future. In this lecture, we’ll consider four aspects of Revelation: 
its original audience, the protagonists in the story, the antagonist, and the ways in 
which the plot moves toward its grand conclusion.
Original Audience of Revelation


Revelation 1:4 tells us that John is addressing “the seven churches that are in 
Asia.” These churches are all located in Asia Minor. To make sure we understand 
the audience, chapters 2 and 3 tell us about the challenges facing these churches, 
setting the context for understanding the narrative that follows. 


One issue facing these churches was persecution. A good example is the church 
at Smyrna. In the 1st century, persecution was local and sporadic. 
●
●The conflict initially involved some members of a synagogue who apparently 
saw the Christians as a threat. When the situation escalated, Roman officials 
got involved. From the Roman point of view, the followers of Jesus were 
sometimes charged with promoting a kind of superstition. 
●
●The belief that Jesus was the Messiah and Lord had political overtones and did 
not fit easily into Greek and Roman religious life. Thus, the officials apparently 
planned to arrest some members of the Christian community at Smyrna. And 
if things did not go well, the writer warns that they could be put to death. 


But persecution was not a problem everywhere. At Pergamum and Thyatira, a 
different issue was assimilation. 

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
240
●
●In this case, there was no immediate threat of violence. Instead, the readers 
felt a broader social pressure to compromise their beliefs and assimilate into 
the dominant patterns of society.
●
●Here, the specific issue was whether to eat food that had been offered to idols 
as sacrifices. The followers of Jesus wondered whether they should join in 
sacrificial meals to be sociable, even though they didn’t believe in the traditional 
deities, or whether they should be true to their beliefs and stay away, even 
though that would seem antisocial. Followers of Christ had to ask how far they 
could blend into their surroundings before they lost their identity. 


A third issue was complacency. The clearest example was the church at Laodicea, 
described at the end of chapter 3. For these believers, the problem was not that 
they felt threatened but that life was too comfortable. The writer pictures them 
saying that they are rich and prosperous, without a care in the world. Thus, he 
gives them a revelation about themselves: that their material wealth is coupled 
with spiritual poverty. They are affluent in one sense but empty in another. 
Their wealth has lulled them into a complacency that has no appeal or vitality. 
Protagonists of Revelation


The protagonists of Revelation are God the Creator and Jesus the Lamb. At the 
beginning of chapter 4, we are taken from earth into heaven, where John sees 
the dazzling throne of God. 
●
●He also sees four mysterious creatures surrounding God: One has a human 
face and another, the face of a lion. Another looks like an ox, and the last is 
an eagle. The four creatures are the heavenly representatives of God’s creation. 
They show that the world’s many creatures have a place in the presence of God. 
●
●Finally, there are 24 elders with gold crowns on their heads. The elders are 
the heavenly representatives of the worshipping community on earth.
●
●The scene has clear connections with the Old Testament. And by drawing 
from earlier prophetic writings, Revelation emphasizes that the God in this 
scene is Israel’s God.


The central element in God’s identity is that he is the Creator. The heavenly 
chorus says that God is worthy of glory and honor because he created

a lamb because he exercises 
the power of God through 
self-sacrifice; he conquers or

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
242
all things. As we said, people often assume that Revelation is all about 
destruction, but in the narrative, we find God’s identity centered in creation. 
It is God’s commitment to the world he created that will inform everything 
that follows.


Chapter 5 focuses on the scroll that God holds in his hand, which seems to 
contain some expression of the divine will. Who is worthy to open the scroll 
and make its contents known? Here, we are introduced to the other main 
protagonist in the story, who is Jesus. But instead of using Jesus’s name, the 
writer brings together the images of the Lion—a warrior, conqueror, and royal 
figure—and the Lamb—weak, vulnerable, and used in sacrifice. 


At this point, the themes of power and self-sacrifice are joined with the theme of 
creation. Revelation depicts the whole created order offering praise to God and 
the Lamb. The song of praise begins in the center, with the heavenly creatures 
and the elders. It then moves outward to people of every tribe, language group, 
and nation. The angels pick up the song and are joined by all the creatures in 
heaven and on earth, in the sea and underground. 
Antagonists of Revelation


The main antagonists in Revelation are Satan and the beast. Where God is 
the Creator, Satan is the destroyer. This contrast is essential for the writer’s 
understanding of evil. He assumes that God created the world to be good. 
Therefore, evil is like a cancer that has invaded it. To preserve life, the cancer 
must be destroyed. That is the defining idea here. God is not out to destroy the 
earth. God is the Creator, who is committed to bringing life. And to do so, God 
must overcome the evil that has invaded his world to enable life to thrive. 


Revelation portrays the destructive power of Satan through another image—
that of a huge red dragon with 7 heads and 10 horns. In the middle of chapter 
12, the writer portrays Satan as a destructive invader. Satan does battle with the 
angels in heaven, but he is thrown down to earth. Now, this evil infiltrates the 
political structures of the world to bring destruction. In chapter 13, we meet the 
beast, who is the chief agent of Satan. Like Satan, the beast has 7 heads and 10 
horns, and it rises from the sea to oppress the peoples of the world.

Lecture 36—Revelation’s Vision of New Creation 
243
●
●As you recall from an earlier lecture, the Old Testament book of Daniel 
pictured four empires as terrifying beasts. There was a lion, a bear, a leopard, 
and a horned monster. Revelation combines the four beasts into one and 
portrays the beast as the mirror opposite of the Lamb. 
●
●
Where the Lamb exercises the power of God, the beast exercises the power of 
Satan. The Lamb endured suffering to redeem people of every tribe and nation. 
Now, the beast inflicts suffering to oppress people. Most striking is that the 
Lamb conquers by self-sacrifice, while the beast conquers by warfare and 
tyranny. 


This literary contrast between the Lamb and the beast is part of the book’s hard-
hitting political and religious critique. At the time Revelation was written, it was 
common for people to treat the Roman emperor as divine, but for the writer of 
Revelation, this was a blasphemous deification of human authority. 


One of basic elements in the imperial cult was that the Roman emperors 
ruled because of their ability to conquer. Revelation is sharply critical of that 
understanding of power, portraying conquest as repulsive. The conquering hero 
is actually a hideous beast. 
The artist who did the sculpture at the 
imperial temple in Aphrodisias pictured 
conquest as something divine and noble—a 
suitable foundation for worship; Revelation 
offers a contrasting picture, in which the 
conquering hero is a hideous beast.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation
244
Plot and Conclusion of Revelation


For the writer of Revelation, the overall question is: Will people give in to the 
oppressive power of the beast, or will they resist and follow the redemptive path 
of the Lamb? To guide their response, the plot of the narrative moves toward 
scenes in which the Lamb prevails over the beast, and the Creator overcomes 
the destroyer. The forces of oppression are defeated, and death itself is overcome 
at the final resurrection. The writer moves through scenes of conflict toward a 
vivid sense of hope in the final chapters. And in those final scenes, he develops 
two motifs that we’ve seen throughout this course: Jerusalem and creation. 


In chapter 21, John tells of a new heaven and a new earth. And he sees a 
new Jerusalem come out of heaven from God. Revelation’s vision of this new 
Jerusalem moves beyond the endless cycle of conflict and loss that we’ve read 
about, toward hope of another order. It pictures a city in which death is gone, 
and grief and pain no longer exist. The scale of the city beggars the imagination. 
It has the radiance of a jewel, its streets are paved with gold, and each gate is 
made of pearl. The city measures 1,500 miles on each side, and its walls are 
1,500 miles high. 


Of course, no city is like this, and for John, that’s the point. He refuses to let 
readers equate any earthly city with the kingdom of God. He knows that every 
human society is deeply flawed, and he is unwilling to let any political order 
claim to be the final one. For John, the purposes of God go beyond those of 
any human being. 


The motif of Jerusalem is joined with that of creation in these climactic scenes. 
At the heart of the city is the river of life, which flows from the throne of God 
and the Lamb. And there is a tree that is rich with fruit; its leaves are for the 
healing of the nations. To some extent, the river and the fruit tree resemble 
what the prophet Ezekiel envisioned, but Revelation goes further. It identifies 
the tree as the tree of life, calling us back to the beginning of Genesis. Of course, 
Genesis depicted a primeval paradise that did not last, but Revelation offers the 
promise of life and healing once again.

