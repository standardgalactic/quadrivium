The fundamental questions arising in mechanics are: Why?, How?, and How much?
The aim of this series is to provide lucid accounts written by authoritative
researchers giving vision and insight in answering these questions on the subject of
mechanics as it relates to solids. The scope of the series covers the entire spectrum
of solid mechanics. Thus it includes the foundation of mechanics; variational
formulations; computational mechanics; statics, kinematics and dynamics of rigid
and elastic bodies; vibrations of solids and structures; dynamical systems and
chaos; the theories of elasticity, plasticity and viscoelasticity; composite materials;
rods, beams, shells and membranes; structural control and stability; soils, rocks and
geomechanics; fracture; tribology; experimental mechanics; biomechanics and
machine design. The median level of presentation is the ﬁrst year graduate student.
Some texts are monographs deﬁning the current state of the ﬁeld; others are
accessible to ﬁnal year undergraduates; but essentially the emphasis is on
readability and clarity.
Springer and Professors Barber and Klarbring welcome book ideas from
authors. Potential authors who wish to submit a book proposal should contact

Preface to the Sixth Edition
For the last several years, the lectures in the course on Aeroelasticity at Duke
University have been recorded and those are available to readers of this book upon
request.
At the end of the 2020 spring semester, each of my then Ph.D. students, Dani
Levin, Kevin McHugh, Maxim Freydin, Michael Lee, and also my faculty col-
league, Jeff Thomas, presented lectures on their current research interests. I know
you will enjoy their presentations as I did on the (1) the use of the ZERO computer
code for aeroelastic analysis, (2) hypersonic ﬂuid-structure interaction, (3) the
construction of Reduced Order Models for the Navier–Stokes equations and (4) the
use of harmonic balance methods for nonlinear aeroelastic analysis. My own lec-
tures largely covered the ﬁrst four chapters of the book, “A Modern Course in
Aeroelasticity”, using the ﬁfth edition. For this sixth edition, the ﬁrst twelve
chapters of the latest edition are largely unchanged except for the correction of
most, if not all, of the typos that appear in the ﬁfth edition. The ﬁrst homework
assignment for the aeroelasticity course last spring was to ﬁnd the typos in the
chapter Static Aeroelasticity. Subsequent homework covered the chapters Dynamic
Aeroelasticity and Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces
and a summer reading course with one of the Ph.D. students in the course, Richard
Hollenbach, led to typos in the later chapters Stall Flutter–Some Recent Advances
in Nonlinear Aeroelasticity, being identiﬁed and corrected. Also, the chapters
Modern Analysis for Complex and Nonlinear Unsteady Flows in Turbomachinery
and Some Recent Advances in Nonlinear Aeroelasticity have been modestly
revised.
The experimental videos that appear on the Aeroelasticity website at Duke
University are discussed extensively in the chapter Aeroelastic Models Design/
Experiment and Correlation with New Theory, a new chapter of the sixth edition,
and represent about 20 years of aeroelasticity experiments conducted on a range of
nonlinear aeroelastic models at Duke University. Much of this work was led by Dr.
Deman Tang. The chapter Aeroelastic Models Design/Experiment and Correlation
with New Theory complements the chapter Experimental Aeroelasticity which
provides an introduction to experimental methods that have traditionally been used
v

based upon the concepts of linear aeroelastic models. Also, in the sixth edition
of the book, a chapter on hypersonic aeroelasticity or ﬂuid structural thermal
dynamics
interaction(FSTDI),
the
chapter
Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics
Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow, is included with contributions from
Kevin McHugh and Maxim Freydin. Currently, hypersonic aeroelasticity or FSTDI
is a particularly active area of research and development including a number of
fascinating experimental programs at several universities and governmental labo-
ratories. An overview of these current and prospective programs is given including
an assessment of the state of the art and the identiﬁcation of outstanding challenges.
The Duke University Aeroelasticity Team hopes that you will enjoy all of this
old and new material. Special acknowledgement and appreciation are extended to
Dr. Deman Tang and Dr. Dani Levin for their contributions to the new edition
of the book and to the Aeroelasticity website, respectively.

Preface to the Sixth Edition

Preface to the Fifth Edition
In this ﬁfth edition, a new chapter is added, Chap. 14, Some Recent Advances in
Nonlinear Aeroelasticity: Fluid-Structure Interaction in the Twenty-First Century,
with a discussion of some of the most recent research results that have been
obtained in the last decade. Also, a new author and distinguished colleague, Dr.
Deman Tang, has joined us. And the opportunity has been taken to correct all the
typographical errors that we and our readers have found.
With this edition, the ﬁrst author is making available upon request video/audio
recordings of his semester-long lectures that cover Chaps. 1-4 as well as selected
lectures on current research topics. It is planned to continually update these
video/audio lectures and these updates will also be made available to those to
purchase the new edition. Also available are lecture notes and additional homework
problems and their solutions augmenting those already included in the text.

Preface to the Fourth Edition
In this edition, several new chapters have been added and others substantially
revised and edited. Chapter 6 on Aeroelasticity in Civil Engineering originally
authored by Robert Scanlan has been substantially revised by his close colleague,
Emil Simiu. Chapter 9 on Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction by Earl Dowell
and Kenneth Hall is entirely new and discusses modern methods for treating linear
and nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics based upon computational ﬂuid dynamics
models and their solutions. Chapter 11 by Earl Dowell, John Edwards and Thomas
Strganac on Nonlinear Aeroelasticity is also new and provides a review of recent
results. Chapter 12 by Robert Clark and David Cox on Aeroelastic Control is also
new and provides an authoritative account of recent developments. Finally, Chapter
13 by Kenneth Hall on Modern Analysis for Complex and Nonlinear Unsteady
Flows in Turbomachinery is also new and provides an insightful and unique
account of this important topic. Many other chapters have been edited for greater
clarity as well and author and subject indices are also provided.
Dr. Deman Tang has provided invaluable contributions to the production of the
text and all of the authors would like to acknowledge his efforts with great
appreciation.

Preface to the Third Edition
The authors would like to thank all those readers of the ﬁrst and second editions
who have written with comments and suggestions. In the third edition, the
opportunity has been taken to revise and update Chapters 1 to 9. Also, three new
chapters have been added, i.e., Chapter 10, Experimental Aeroelasticity; Chapter
11, Nonlinear Aeroelasticity and Chapter 12, Aeroelastic Control. Chapter 10 is a
brief introduction to a vast subject; Chapter 11 is an overview of a frontier of
research and Chapter 12 is the ﬁrst connected, authoritative account of the feedback
control of aeroelastic systems. Chapter 12 meets a signiﬁcant need in the literature.
The authors of the ﬁrst and second editions welcome two new authors, David Peters
who has provided a valuable revision of Chapter 7 on rotorcraft and Edward
Crawley who has provided Chapter 12 on aeroelastic control. It is a privilege and a
pleasure to have them as members of the team. The author of Chapter 10 would also
like to acknowledge the great help he has received over the year from his distin-
guished colleague, Wilmer H. “Bill” Reed, III, in the study of experimental
aeroelasticity. Mr. Reed kindly provided the ﬁgures for Chapter 10. The author of
Chapter 12 would like to acknowledge the signiﬁcant scholarly contribution of
Charrissa Lin and Ken Kazarus in preparing the chapter on aeroelastic control.
Finally, the readers of the ﬁrst and second editions will note that the authors and
subject indices have been omitted from this edition. If any reader ﬁnds this an
inconvenience, please contact the editor and we will reconsider the matter for the
next edition.

Preface to the Second Edition
The authors would like to thank all those readers who have written with comments
and errata for the First Edition. Many of these have been incorporated into the
Second Edition. They would like to thank Professor Holt Ashley of Stanford
University who has been most helpful in identifying and correcting various errata.
Also, the opportunity has been taken in the Second Edition to bring up-to-date
several of the chapters as well as add a chapter on unsteady transonic aerodynamics
and aeroelasticity. Chapters 2, 5, 6 and 8 have been substantially revised. These
cover the topics of Static Aeroelasticity, Stall Flutter, Aeroelastic Problems of Civil
Engineering Structures and Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines, respectively. Chapter
9, Unsteady Transonic Aerodynamics and Aeroelasticity, is new and covers this
rapidly developing subject in more breadth and depth than the First Edition. Again,
the emphasis is on fundamental concepts rather than, for example, computer code
development per se. Unfortunately due to the press of other commitments, it has not
been possible to revise Chapter 7, Aeroelastic Problems of Rotorcraft. However, the
Short Bibliography has been expanded for this subject as well as for others. It is
hoped that the readers of the First Edition and also new readers will ﬁnd the Second
Edition worthy of their study.

Preface to the First Edition
A reader who achieves a substantial command of the material contained in this book
should be able to read with understanding most of the literature in the ﬁeld. Possible
exceptions may be certain special aspects of the subject such as the aeroelasticity of
plates and shells or the use of electronic feedback control to modify aeroelastic
behavior. The ﬁrst author has considered the former topic in a separate volume. The
latter topic is also deserving of a separate volume.
In the ﬁrst portion of the book, the basic physical phenomena of divergence,
control surface effectiveness, ﬂutter and gust response of aeronautical vehicles are
treated. As an indication of the expanding scope of the ﬁeld, representative
examples are also drawn from the non-aeronautical literature. To aid the student
who is encountering these phenomena for the ﬁrst time, each is introduced in the
context of a simple physical model and then reconsidered systematically in more
complicated models using more sophisticated mathematics.
Beyond the introductory portion of the book, there are several special features
of the text. One is the treatment of unsteady aerodynamics. This crucial part of
aeroelasticity is usually the most difﬁcult for the experienced practitioner as well as
the student. The discussion is developed from the fundamental theory underlying
numerical lifting surface analysis. Not only the well-known results for subsonic and
supersonic ﬂow are covered but also some of the recent developments for transonic
ﬂow, which hold the promise of bringing effective solution techniques to this
important regime.
Professor Sisto’s chapter on Stall Flutter is an authoritative account of this
important topic. A difﬁcult and still incompletely understood phenomenon, stall
ﬂutter, is discussed in terms of its fundamental aspects as well as its signiﬁcance in
applications. The reader will ﬁnd this chapter particularly helpful as an introduction
to this complex subject.
Another special feature is a series of chapters on three areas of advanced
application of the fundamentals of aeroelasticity. The ﬁrst of these is a discussion of
Aeroelastic Problems of Civil Engineering Structures by Professor Scanlan. The
next is a discussion on the Aeroelasticity of Helicopters and V/STOL aircraft by
Professor Curtiss. The ﬁnal chapter in this series treats Aeroelasticity in
xv

Turbomachines and is written by Professor Sisto. This series of chapters is unique
in the aeroelasticity literature and the ﬁrst author feels particularly fortunate to have
the contributions of these eminent experts.
The emphasis in this book is on fundamentals because no single volume can
hope to be comprehensive in terms of applications. However, the above three
chapters should give the reader an appreciation for the relationship between theory
and practice. One of the continual fascinations of aeroelasticity is this close inter-
play between fundamentals and applications. If one is to deal successfully with
applications, a solid grounding in the fundamentals is essential.
For the beginning student, the ﬁrst course in aeroelasticity could cover Chapters
1-3 and selected portions of Chapter 4. For a second course and the advanced
student or research worker, the remaining chapters would be appropriate. In the
latter portions of the book, more comprehensive literature citations are given to
permit ready access to the current literature.
The reader familiar with the standard texts by Scanlan and Rosenbaum, Fung,
Bisplinghoff, Ashley and Halfman and Bisplinghoff and Ashley will appreciate
readily the debt the authors owe to them. Recent books by Petre (Theory of
Aeroelasticity. Vol. I Statics, Vol. II Dynamics. In Romanian Publishing House
of the Academy of the Socialist Republic of Romania, Bucharest, 1966) and
Forsching (Fundamentals of Aeroelasticity. In German. Springer-Verlag, Berlin,
1974) should also be mentioned though these are less accessible to an
English-speaking audience. It is hoped the reader will ﬁnd this volume a worthy
successor.

Other journals will have aeroelasticity articles, of course, but these are among
those with the most consistent coverage.
The impact of aeroelasticity on design is not discussed in any detail in this book.
For insight into this important area, the reader may consult the following volumes
prepared by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in its series on
SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN CRITERIA. Although these documents focus on
space vehicle application, much of the material is relevant to aircraft as well. The
depth and breadth of coverage vary considerably from one volume to the next, but
each contains at least a brief State-of-the-Art review of its topics as well as a
discussion of Recommended Design Practices. Further, some important topics are
included which have not been treated at all in the present book. These include the
following as already mentioned in the Preface.
Aeroelasticity of plates and shells (panel ﬂutter) (NASA SP-8004) and
Aeroelastic effects on control systems dynamics (NASA SP-8016, NASA SP-8036
NASA SP-8079) as well as Structural response to time-dependent separated ﬂuid
ﬂows (buffeting) (NASA SP-8001), Fluid motions inside elastic containers (fuel
sloshing) (NASA SP-8009, NASA SP-8031) and Coupled structural propulsion
instability (POGO) (NASA SP-8055).
It was intended to revise these volumes periodically to keep them up-to-date.
Unfortunately, this has not yet been done.

Introduction
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract This brief chapter touches on the basic questions to be addressed in the
book and provides some historical context for the development of the ﬁeld of aeroe-
lasticity.
Several years ago, Collar suggested that aeroelasticity could be usefully visualized
as forming a triangle of disciplines, dynamics, solid mechanics and (unsteady) aero-
dynamics (Fig.1).
Aeroelasticity is concerned with those physical phenomena which involve sig-
niﬁcant mutual interaction among inertial, elastic and aerodynamic forces. Other
important technical ﬁelds can be identiﬁed by pairing the several points of the trian-
gle. For example,
• Stability and control (ﬂight mechanics) = dynamics + aerodynamics
• Structural vibrations = dynamics + solid mechanics
• Static aeroelasticity = steady ﬂow aerodynamics + solid mechanics
Conceptually, each of these technical ﬁelds may be thought of as a special aspect
of aeroelasticity. For historical reasons only the last topic, static aeroelasticity, is
normally so considered. However, the impact of aeroelasticity on stability and control
(ﬂight mechanics) has increased substantially in recent years.
In modern aerospace vehicles, the relevant physical phenomena may be even more
complicated. For example, stresses induced by high temperature environments can
be important in aeroelastic problems, hence the term
aerothermoelasticity
In other applications, the dynamics of the guidance and control system may signiﬁ-
cantly affect aeroelastic problems, or vice versa, hence the term

For a historical discussion of aeroelasticity including its impact on aerospace vehicle
design, consult in this chapter of Bisplinghoff and Ashley [2] and AGARD CP No.46,
“Aeroelastic Effects from a Flight Mechanics Standpoint” [6].
We shall ﬁrst concentrate on the dynamics and solid mechanics aspects of aeroe-
lasticity with the aerodynamic forces taken as given. Subsequently, the aerodynamic
aspects of aeroelasticity shall be treated from ﬁrst principles. Theoretical methods
will be emphasized, although these will be related to experimental methods and
results where this will add to our understanding of the theory and its limitations. For
simplicity, we shall begin with the special case of static aeroelasticity.
Although the technological cutting edge of the ﬁeld of aeroelasticity has centered
in the past on aeronautical applications, applications are found at an increasing rate
in civil engineering, e.g., ﬂows about bridges and tall buildings; mechanical engi-
neering, e.g., ﬂows around turbomachinery blades and ﬂuid ﬂows in ﬂexible pipes;
and nuclear engineering; e.g., ﬂows about fuel elements and heat exchanger vanes.
It may well be that such applications will increase in both absolute and relative num-
ber as the technology in these areas demands lighter weight structures under more
severe ﬂow conditions. Much of the fundamental theoretical and experimental devel-
opments can be applied to these areas as well and indeed it is hoped that a common
language can be used in these several areas of technology. To further this hope we
shall discuss subsequently in some detail several examples in these other ﬁelds, even
though our principal focus shall be on aeronautical problems. Separate chapters on
civil engineering, turbomachinery and helicopter (rotor systems) applications will
introduce the reader to the fascinating phenomena which arise in these ﬁelds.
Since most aeroelastic phenomena are of an undesirable character, leading to loss
of design effectiveness or even sometimes spectacular structural failure as in the
case of aircraft wing ﬂutter or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster, the spreading
importance of aeroelastic effects will not be warmly welcomed by most design engi-
neers. However, the mastery of the material to be discussed here will permit these
effects to be better understood and dealt with if not completely overcome. Moreover

in recent years, the beneﬁcial effects of aeroelasticity have received greater attention.
For example, the promise of new aerospace systems such as uninhabited air vehicles
(UAVs) and morphing aircraft will undoubtedly be more fully realized by exploiting
the beneﬁts of aeroelasticity while mitigating the risks.

Static Aeroelasticity
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract The basics of static aeroelasticty, in contrast to dynamic aeroelasticity, are
reviewed and some classic subjects such as divergence and control surface reversal
are treated. The discussion starts with simple mathematical and physical models and
progresses to more complex models and solution methods. Most of these models and
methods prove to be useful in dynamic aeroelasticity as well.

Typical Section Model of an Airfoil
We shall ﬁnd a simple, somewhat contrived, physical system useful for introducing
several aeroelastic problems. This is the so-called ‘typical section’ which is a popular
pedagogical device.1 This simpliﬁed aeroelastic system consists of a rigid, ﬂat, plate
airfoil mounted on a torsional spring attached to a wind tunnel wall. See Fig.1; the
airﬂow over the airfoil is from left to right.
The principal interest in this model for the aeroelastician is the rotation of the
plate (and consequent twisting of the spring), α, as a function of airspeed. If the
spring were very stiff or airspeed were very slow, the rotation would be rather small;
however, for ﬂexible springs or high ﬂow velocities the rotation may twist the spring
beyond its ultimate strength and lead to structural failure. A typical plot of elastic
twist, αe, versus airspeed, U, is given in Fig.2. The airspeed at which the elastic
twist increases rapidly to the point of failure is called the ‘divergence airspeed’,
UD. A major aim of any theoretical model is to accurately predict UD. It should
be emphasized that the above curve is representative not only of our typical section
model but also of real aircraft wings. Indeed the primary difference is not in the basic
physical phenomenon of divergence, but rather in the elaborateness of the theoretical
analysis required to predict accurately UD for an aircraft wing versus that required
for our simple typical section model.

To determine UD theoretically we proceed as follows. The equation of static
equilibrium simply states that the sum of aerodynamic plus elastic moments about
any point on the airfoil is zero. By convention, we take the point about which moments
are summed as the point of spring attachment, the so-called ‘elastic center’ or ‘elastic
axis’ of the airfoil.
The total aerodynamic angle of attack, α, is taken as the sum of some initial angle
of attack, α0 (with the spring untwisted), plus an additional increment due to elastic
twist of the spring, αe.
α = α0 + αe
(1.1)
In addition, we deﬁne a point on the airfoil known as the ‘aerodynamic center’.2 This
is the point on the airfoil about which the aerodynamic moment is independent of
angle of attack, α. Thus, we may write the moment about the elastic axis as
2 For two dimensional, incompressible ﬂow this is at the airfoil quarter-chord; for supersonic ﬂow
it moves back to the half-chord. See Ashley and Landahl [1]. References are given at the end of
each chapter.

Equation (1.3a) deﬁnes CL and CM AC (1.3b) is a Taylor Series expansion of CL for
small α. CL0 is the lift coefﬁcient at α ≡0. From (1.2), (1.3a) and (1.3b), we see the
moment is also expanded in a Taylor series. The above forms are traditional in the
aerodynamic literature. They are not necessarily those a nonaerodynamicist would
choose.
Note that CL0, ∂CL/∂α, CM AC0 are nondimensional functions of airfoil shape,
planform and Mach number. For a ﬂat plate in two-dimensional incompressible ﬂow

In what follows, we shall take CL0 ≡0 for convenience and without any essential
loss of information.

Now consider the elastic moment. If the spring has linear moment-twist character-
istics then the elastic moment (positive nose up) is −Kααe where Kα is the elastic
spring constant and has units of moment (torque) per angle of twist. Hence, summing
moments we have

This solution has several interesting properties. Perhaps most important is the fact
that at a particular dynamic pressure the elastic twist becomes inﬁnitely large. This
is, when the denominator of the right-hand side of (1.6) vanishes

Equation (1.7) represents what is termed the ‘divergence condition’ and the cor-
responding dynamic pressure which may be obtained by solving (1.7) is termed the
‘divergence dynamic pressure’,
qD ≡
Kα
Se(∂CL/∂α)
(1.8)
Since only the positive dynamic pressures are physically meaningful, note that only
for e > 0 will divergence occur, i.e., when the aerodynamic center is ahead of the
elastic axis. Using (1.8), (1.6) may be rewritten in a more concise form as
αe = (q/qD)α0
1 −q/qD
(1.9)
Of course, the elastic twist does not become inﬁnitely large for any real airfoil;
because this would require an inﬁnitely large aerodynamic moment. Moreover, the
linear relation between the elastic twist and the aerodynamic moment would be
violated long before that. However, the elastic twist can become so large as to cause
structural failure. For this reason, all aircraft are designed to ﬂy below the divergence

dynamic pressure of all airfoil or lifting surfaces, e.g., wings, ﬁns, control surfaces.
Now let us examine Eqs.(1.5) and (1.9) for additional insight into our problem,
again assuming CM AC0 = 0 for simplicity. Two special cases will be informative.
First, consider α0 ≡0. Then (1.5) may be written
αe

qS ∂CL
∂α e −Kα

= 0
(1.5a)
Excluding the trivial case αe = 0 we conclude from (1.5a) that
qS ∂CL
∂α e −Kα = 0
(1.7a)
which is the ‘divergence condition’. This will be recognized as an eigenvalue prob-
lem, the vanishing of the coefﬁcient of αe in (1.5a) being the condition for nontrivial
solutions of the unknown, αe.3 Hence, ‘divergence’ requires only a consideration of
elastic deformations.
Secondly, let us consider another special case of a somewhat different type, α0 ̸=
0, but αe ≪α0. Then (1.5) may be written approximately as
eqS ∂CL
∂α α0 −Kααe = 0
(1.10)
Solving
αe = qSe(∂CL/∂α)α0
Kα
(1.11)
Note this solution agrees with (1.6) if the denominator of (1.6) can be approximated
by
1 −q Se
Kα
∂CL
∂α = 1 −q
qD
≈1
Hence, this approximation is equivalent to assuming that the dynamic pressure
is much smaller than its divergence value. Note that the term neglected in (1.5)
is the aerodynamic moment due to the elastic twist. This term can be usefully
thought of as the ‘aeroelastic feedback’.4 Without this term, solution (1.11) is valid
only when q/qD ≪1; and it cannot predict divergence. A feedback diagram of
Eq.(1.5) is given in Fig.3. Thus, when the forward loop gain,G, exceeds unity,
G ≡qeS(∂CL/∂α)/Kα > 1, the system is statically unstable, see Eq.(1.8). Hence,
aeroelasticity can also be thought of as the study of aerodynamic + elastic feed-
3 Here in static aeroelasticity q plays the role of the eigenvalue; in dynamic aeroelasticity q will be
a parameter and the (complex) frequency will be the eigenvalue. This is a source of confusion for
some students when they ﬁrst study the subject.

back systems. One might also note the similarity of this divergence problem to
conventional ‘buckling’ of structures.5 Having exhausted the interpretations of this
problem, we will quickly pass on to some slightly more complicated problems, but
whose physical content is similar.
1.1
Typical Section Model with Control Surface
We shall add a control surface to our typical section of Fig.1, as indicated in Fig.4.
For simplicity, we take α0 = CM AC0 = 0; hence, α = αe. The aerodynamic lift is
given by
L = qSCL = qS

∂δ δ

(1.12)
and the moment by

and the moment about the hinge line of the control surface by
H = qSHcHCH = qSHcH
∂CH
∂α α + ∂CH

∂δ , ∂CM AC

∂δ are aerodynamic constants which vary with Mach and airfoil
geometry. Note ∂CH
∂δ is typically negative.
The basic purpose of a control surface is to change the lift (or moment) on the
main lifting surface. It is interesting to examine aeroelastic effects on this lift.
To write the equations of equilibrium, we need the elastic moments about the
elastic axis of the main lifting surface and about the hinge line of the control surface.
These are −Kαα (positive nose up), −Kδ(δ −δ0) (positive tail down), and δe ≡
δ −δ0, where δe is the elastic twist of control surface in which δ0 is the difference

and a similar equation for δ. To consider divergence we again set the denominator
to zero. This gives a quadratic equation in the dynamic pressure q. Hence, there are
two values of divergence dynamic pressure. Only the lower positive value of the two
is physically signiﬁcant.
In addition to the somewhat more complicated form of the divergence condition,
thereisanewphysicalphenomenon associatedwiththecontrolsurfacecalled‘control
surface reversal’. If the two springs were rigid, i.e.,Kα →∞and Kδ →∞, then

where α, δ are determined by solving the equilibrium Eqs.(1.15), and (1.16). In
general, the latter value of the lift will be smaller than the rigid value of lift. Indeed,
the lift may actually become zero or even negative due to aeroelastic effects. Such
an occurrence is called ‘control surface reversal’. To simplify matters and show the
essential character of control surface reversal, we will assume Kδ →∞and hence,
δ →δ0 from the equilibrium condition (1.16). Solving the equilibrium Eq.(1.15),

where qR is given by (1.24) and qD by (1.8). It is very interesting to note that when

now the lowest root of the denominator of (1.17). Can you reason physically why
this is so?6

A graphical depiction of (1.25) is given in the Fig.5 where the two cases, qD > qR
and qD < qR, are distinguished. In the former case L/Lr, decreases with increasing
q and in the latter the opposite is true. Although the graphs are shown for q > qD,
our analysis is no longer valid when the divergence condition is exceeded without
taking into account nonlinear effects. It is interesting to note that the qR given by
(1.24) is still the correct answer even for ﬁnite Kδ. Consider (1.15). For reversal or
zero lift, L = 0, (1.15) simpliﬁes to

and (1.12) becomes

nontrivial solutions) gives

Solving (1.26) for qR gives (1.24). Note that by this approach an eigenvalue problem
has been created. Also note the moment equilibrium about the control surface hinge
line does not enter into this calculation. See Appendix B, Chapter 2 for a more
conceptually straightforward, but algebraically more tedious approach.
At the generalized reversal condition, when α0 ̸= 0, CM AC0 ̸= 0, the lift due to a
change in δ is zero, by deﬁnition. In mathematical language,
dL
dδ = 0 at q = qR
(1.27)
To see how this generalized deﬁnition relates to our earlier deﬁnition of the rever-
sal condition, consider again the equation for lift and also the equation for overall
moment equilibrium of the main wing plus control surface, viz.

Note that neither CM AC0 nor α0 appear in (1.30). Moreover when (1.30) is substituted
into (1.29) and dL/dδ is set to zero, the same expression for qR is obtained as before,
(1.24), when reversal was deﬁned as L = 0 (for α0 = CM AC0 = 0).
This result may be given a further physical interpretation. Consider a Taylor series
expansion for L in terms of δ about the reference condition, δ ≡0. Note that δ ≡0
corresponds to a wing without any control surface deﬂection relative to the main
wing. Hence the condition δ ≡0, may be thought of as a wing without any control
surface.
The lift at any δ may then be expressed as
L(δ) = L(δ = 0) + ∂L
∂δ

δ=0δ + · · ·
(1.31)
Because a linear model is used, it is clear that higher order terms in this expansion
vanish. Moreover, it is clear that dL/dδ is that same for any δ, cf. (1.29) and (1.30).
Now consider L(δ = 0). From (1.19)
L(δ = 0) = qS ∂CL

and hence
L(δ) = 0 or dL

(1.35)
are equivalent statements when α0 = CM AC0 = 0.
For α0 ̸= 0 and/or CM AC0 ̸= 0, however, the reversal condition is more meaning-
fully deﬁned as the condition when the lift due to δ ̸= 0 is zero, i.e.
dL
dδ = 0 at q = qR
(1.27)
In this case, at the reversal condition from (1.32) and (1.33),

Typical Section Model—Nonlinear Effects
For sufﬁciently large twist angles, the assumption of elastic and/or aerodynamic
moments proportional to twist angle becomes invalid. Typically the elastic spring
becomes stiffer at larger twist angles; for example the elastic moment-twist relation
might be
ME = −Kααe −Kα3α3
e
where Kα > 0, Kα3>0. The lift angle of attack relation might be
L = qS[(∂CL/∂α)α −(∂CL/∂α)3α3]
where ∂CL/∂α and (∂CL/∂α)3 are positive quantities. Note the lift decreases for a
large α due to ﬂow separation from the airfoil. Combining the above in a moment
equation of equilibrium and assuming for simplicity that α0 = CM AC = 0, we obtain
(recall (1.5))
eqS[(∂CL/∂α)αe −(∂CL/∂α)3α3
e] −[Kααe + Kα3α3
e] = 0
Rearranging,
αe[eqS(∂CL/∂α) −Kα] −α3
e[eqS(∂CL/∂α)3 + Kα3] = 0

To be physically meaningful αe must be a real number; hence the right hand side of
the above equation must be a positive number for the nontrivial solution αe ̸= 0 to
be possible.
For simplicity let us ﬁrst assume that e > 0. Then we see that only for q > qD (i.e.,
for eqS(∂CL/∂α) > Kα) are nontrivial solutions possible. See Fig.6. For q < qD,
αe ≡0 as a consequence of setting α0 ≡CM AC ≡0. Clearly for e > 0, αe ̸= 0 when
q > qD where
qD ≡
Kα
eS∂CL/∂α
Notethattwo(symmetrical)equilibriumsolutionsarepossibleforq > qD.Theactual
choice of equilibrium position would depend upon how the airfoil is disturbed (by
gusts for example) or possibly upon imperfections in the spring or airfoil geometry.
α0 may be thought of as an initial imperfection and its sign would determine which

of the two equilibria positions occurs. Note that for the nonlinear model αe remains
ﬁnite for any ﬁnite q. For e < 0, the equilibrium conﬁgurations would be as shown
in the Fig.6 where
qD3 = −Kα3/[eS(∂CL/∂α)3]
and
α2
e∞= ∂CL/∂α/(∂CL/∂α)3
As far as the author is aware, the behavior indicated in Fig.6 has never been observed
experimentally. Presumably structural failure would occur for q > qD, even though
αe∞is ﬁnite. It would be most interesting to try to achieve the above equilibrium
diagram experimentally.
The above discussion does not exhaust the possible types of nonlinear behavior
for the typical section model. Perhaps one of the most important nonlinearities in
practice is that associated with the control surface spring and the elastic restraint of
the control surface connection to the main lifting surface.7

Beam-Rod Representation of Large Aspect Ratio Wing
We shall now turn to a more sophisticated, but more realistic beam-rod model which
contains the same basic physical ingredients as the typical section.8 A beam-rod is
here deﬁned as a ﬂat plate with rigid chordwise sections whose span,l, is substantially
larger than its chord, c. See Fig.7. The airﬂow is in the x direction. The equation of

Fig. 8 Differential element of beam-rod
Equation (2.1) can be derived by considering a differential element dy (see Fig.8) The
internal elastic moment is G J from the theory of elasticity.9 Note for dαe/dy > 0,
G J(dαe/dy) is positive nose down. Summing moments on the differential element,

Turning now to the aerodynamic theory, we shall use the ‘strip theory’ approximation.
That is, we shall assume that the aerodynamic lift and moment at station y depends
only on the angle of attack at station y (and is independent of the angle of attack at
other spanwise locations.) Thus moments and lift per unit span are, as before,
My = MAC + Le
(2.3a)
L ≡qcCL
(2.3b)
where now the lift and moment coefﬁcients are11 given by
CL(y) = ∂CL
∂α [α0(y) + αe(y)]
(2.3c)
MAC = qc2cM AC
(2.3d)
Equations (2.3b) and (2.3d) deﬁne CL and CM AC respectively.

which is subject to boundary conditions (2.2). These boundary conditions have the
nondimensional form

(2.5)
11 A more complete aerodynamic model would allow for the effect of an angle of attack at one
spanwise location, say η, on (nondimentional) lift at another, say y. This relation would then be
replaced by CL(y) =

A(y −η)[α0(η) + αe(η)]dη where A is an aerodynamic inﬂuence function
which must be measured or calculated from an appropriate theory. More will be said about this later.

The general solution to (2.4) is
αe = A sin λ ˜y + B cos λ ˜y + K
λ2
(2.6)
Applying boundary conditions (2.5), we obtain
B + K
λ2 = 0,
λ[A cos λ −B sin λ] = 0
(2.7)
Solving equation (2.7), A = −(K/λ2) tan λ, B = −K/λ2, so that
αe = K
λ2 [1 −tan λ sin λ ˜y −cos λ ˜y]
(2.8)
Divergence occurs when αe →∞, i.e., tan λ →∞, or cos λ →0.12 Thus, for
λ = λm = (2m −1) π
2 (m = 1, 2, 3, . . .), αe →∞. The lowest of these, λ1 = π
2 is
physically signiﬁcant. Using the deﬁnition of λ preceding Eq.(2.4), the divergence
dynamic pressure is
q = (π/2)2 G J
l /lce(∂CL/∂α)

Recognizing that S = lc, we see that (2.9) is equivalent to the typical section value,
(1.8), with

Consideragain(2.8).Afurtherphysicalinterpretationofthisresultmaybehelpful.
For simplicity, consider the case when CM AC0 = 0 and thus K = −λ2α0. Then the
expression for αe, (2.8), may be written as
αe = α0[−1 + tan λ sin λ ˜y + cos λ ˜y]
(2.8a)
The tip of twist of ˜y = 1 may be used to characterize the variation of αe with λ, i.e,
αe( ˜y = 1) = α0

(2.8b)
and thus

From (2.8)c, we see that for low ﬂow speeds or dynamic pressure, λ →0, α = α0.
As λ →π/2, α monotonically increases and α →∞as λ →π/2. For a given wing
design, a certain twist might be allowable. From (2.8)c, or its counterpart for more
complex physical and mathematical models, the corresponding allowable or design
λ may be determined.

T ≡G Jdαe/dy. Using (2.8) and the deﬁnition of T , for a given allowable T the
corresponding allowable λ or q may be determined.
2.2
Eigenvalue and Eigenfunction Approach
One could have treated divergence from the point of view of an eigenvalue problem.
Neglecting those terms which do not depend on the elastic twist, i.e., setting α0 =
CM AC0 = 0, we have K = 0 and hence
d2α
d ˜y2 + λ2α = 0
(2.11)
with
α = 0 at y = 0
dα
d ˜y = 0 at y = 1
(2.12)
The general solution is
α = A sin λ ˜y + B cos λ ˜y
(2.13)
Using (2.12) and (2.13)
B = 0
λ[A cos λ −B sin λ]
we conclude that
A = 0
or
λ cos λ = 0 and A ̸= 0
(2.14)

22
E. H. Dowell
The latter condition, of course, is ‘divergence’. Can you show that λ = 0, does not
lead to divergence? What does (2.13) say? For each eigenvalue, λ = λm = (2m −
1) π
2 there is an eigenfunction,
αm ∼sin λm ˜y = sin (2m −1)π
2 ˜y
(2.15)
These eigenfunctions are of interest for a number of reasons:
1. They give us the twist distribution at the divergence dynamic pressure as seen
above in (2.15).
2. They may be used to obtain a series expansion of the solution for any dynamic
pressure.
3. They are useful for developing an approximate solution for variable property
wings.
Let us consider further the second of these. Now we let α0 ̸= 0, CM AC0 ̸= 0 and
begin with (2.4)
d2αe
d ˜y
+ λ2αe = K
(2.4)
Assume a series solution of the form

Similar calculations can be carried out for airfoils whose stiffness, chord, etc.,
are not constants but vary with spanwise location. One way to do this is to ﬁrst
determine the eigenfunction expansion for the variable property wing as done above
for the constant property wing. The determination of such eigenfunctions may itself
be fairly complicated, however. An alternative procedure can be employed which
expands the solution for the variable property wing in terms of the eigenfunctions
of the constant property wing. This is the last of the reasons previously cited for
examining the eigenfunctions.
13 For a more detailed mathematical discussion of the above, see Hildebrand [6], pp. 224–234. This
problem is one of a type known as ‘Sturm-Liouville Problems’.

The ﬁrst and second terms cannot be simpliﬁed further unless the eigenfunctions or

not as simply related to An as in the constant property wing example. Equation (2.26)
represents a system of equations for the an. In matrix notation

By truncating the series to a ﬁnite number of terms, we may formally solve for the

(2.28)
The divergence condition is simply that the determinant of Cmn vanish (and hence
an →∞)
|Cmn| = 0
(2.29)
which is a polynomial in λ2. It should be emphasized that for an ‘exact’ solu-
tion, (2.27), (2.28) etc., are inﬁnite systems of equations (in an inﬁnite number of
unknowns). In practice, some large but ﬁnite number of equations is used to obtain
an accurate approximation. By systematically increasing the terms in the series, the
convergence of the method can be assessed. This procedure is usually referred to
as Galerkin’s method or as a ‘modal’ method.14 The modes, αn, used are called
‘primitive modes’ to distinguish them from eigenfunctions, i.e., they are ‘primitive
functions’ for a variable property wing even though they are eigenfunctions for a
constant property wing.

Rolling of a Straight Wing
We shall now consider a more complex physical and mathematical variation on our
earlier static aeroelastic lifting surface (wing) studies. For variety, we treat a new
physical situation, the rolling of a wing (rotation about the root axis). Nevertheless,
we shall meet again our old friends, ‘divergence’ and ‘control surface effectiveness’
or ‘reversal’.
The present analysis differs from the previous one as follows:
a integral equation formulation versus differential equation formulation
b aerodynamic induction effects versus ‘strip’ theory
c ‘lumped element’ method of solution versus modal (or eigenfunction) solution.
The geometry of the problem is shown in Fig.9.

Integral Equation of Equilibrium
The integral equation of equilibrium is
α(y) =
 1
0
Cαα(y, η)My(η)dη
(3.1)
Before15 deriving the above equation, let us ﬁrst consider the physical interpretation
of Cαα:
Apply a unit point moment at some point, say y = γ, i.e.,
My(η) = δ(η −γ)
Then (3.1) becomes
α(y) =
 1
0
Cαα(y, η)δ(η −γ)dη = Cαα(y, γ)
(3.2)
Thus Cαα(y, γ) is the twist a y due to a unit moment at γ, or alternatively, Cαα (y, η)
is the twist at y due to a unit moment at η. Cαα is called a structural inﬂuence
function.
Also note that (3.1) states that to obtain the total twist, one multiplies the actual
distributed torque, My, by Cαα and sums (integrates) over the span. This is physically
plausible.
15 For simplicity, α0 ≡0 in what follows.

Static Aeroelasticity
27
Cαα plays a central role in the integral equation formulation.16 The physical
interpretation of Cαα suggests a convenient means of measuring Cαα in a labora-
tory experiment. By successively placing unit couples at various locations along
the wing and measuring the twists of all such stations for each loading position we
can determine Cαα. This capability for measuring Cαα gives the integral equation a
preferred place in aeroelastic analysis where Cαα and/or G J are not always easily
determinable from purely theoretical considerations.

elastic bodies are symmetric in their arguments. In the case of Cαα these are y and

Note that ALα, ALδ are more difﬁcult to measure than their structural counterpart,
Cαα. One requires an experimental model to which one can apply unit angles of
attack at various discrete points along the span of the wing. This requires a rather
sophisticated model and also introduces experimental difﬁculties in establishing and
maintaining a smooth ﬂow over the airfoil. Conversely

are relatively easy to measure since they only require a rolling or control surface

Aeroelastic Equations of Equilibrium and Lumped
Element Solution Method
The key relations are (3.1) and (3.19). The former describes the twist due to an
aerodynamic moment load, the latter the aerodynamic moment due to twist as well
as rolling and control surface rotation.
By substituting (3.19) into (3.1), one could obtain a single equation for α. How-
ever, this equation is not easily solved analytically except for some simple cases,
which are more readily handled by the differential equation approach. Hence, we
seek an approximate solution technique. Perhaps the most obvious and convenient
method is to approximate the integrals in (3.1) and (3.19) by sums, i.e., the wing
is broken into various spanwise segments or ‘lumped elements’. For example, (3.1)
would be approximated as:
α (yi) ∼=


i=1
Cαα (yi, η j)My (η j)η
i = 1, . . . , N
(3.20)
where η is the segment width and N the total number of segments. Similarly, (3.19)

we may formally solve (3.23) as

(3.24)
Now let us interpret this solution.
3.7
Divergence
Recall that the inverse does not exist if
| D |= 0
(3.25)
and hence,
{α} →{∞}
Equation (3.25) gives rise to an eigenvalue problem for the divergence dynamic
pressure, qD. Note (3.25) is a polynomial in q.
The lowest possible root (eigenvalue) of (3.25) gives the q of physical interest,
i.e.,qDivergence. Rather than seeking the roots of the polynomial we might more
simply plot |D| versus q to determine the values of dynamic pressure for which the
determinant is zero. A schematic of such results for various choices of N is shown
below in Fig.11. From the above results we may plot qD (the lowest positive q for
which |D| = 0) versus N as shown below in Fig.12. The ‘exact’ value of qD is
obtained at N →∞. Usually reasonably accurate results can be obtained for small
values of N, say 10 or so. The divergence speed calculated above does not depend
upon the rolling of the wing, i.e.,p is considered prescribed, e.g., p = 0.

Reversal and Rolling Effectiveness
In the above we have taken pl/U as known; however,in reality it is a function of δR
and the problem parameters through the requirement that the wing be in static rolling
equilibrium, i.e., it is an additional degree of freedom. For rolling equilibrium at a
steady roll rate, p, the rolling moment about the x-axis is zero.

Note that (3.29) is a single algebraic equation. Equation (3.29) plus (3.20) and (3.21)
are 2N + 1 linear algebraic equations in the N(α) plus N(My) plus 1(p) unknowns.
As before {My} is normally eliminated using (3.21) in (3.20) to obtain N, Eq.(3.22),
plus 1, Eq.(3.29), equations in N(α) plus 1(p) unknowns. In either case the diver-
gence condition my be determined by setting the determinant of coefﬁcients to zero
and determining the smallest positive eigenvalue, q = qD.
For q < qD, pl/U (and α) may be determined from (3.23) and (3.29). Since our
mathematical model is linear
pl/U ∼δR
and hence a convenient plot of the results is as shown in Fig.13. As

then ‘rolling reversal’ is said to have occurred and the corresponding q = qR is
called the ‘reversal dynamic pressure’. The basic phenomenon is the same as that
encountered previously as ‘control surface reversal’. Figures13 and 14 should be
compared to Fig.5a, b.
It is worth emphasizing that the divergence condition obtained above by permit-
ting p to be determined by (static) rolling equilibrium will be different from that
obtained previously by assuming p = 0. The latter physically corresponds to an air-
craft constrained not to roll, as might be the case for some wind tunnel models. The
former corresponds to a model or aircraft completely free to roll.18
The above analysis has introduced the simple yet powerful idea of structural and
aerodynamic inﬂuence functions. While the utility of the concept has been illustrated
for a one-dimensional aeroelastic model, not the least advantage of such an approach
istheconceptualeasewithwhichthebasicnotioncanbeextendedtotwo-dimensional
models, e.g., plate-like structures, or even three-dimensional ones (though the latter
is rarely needed for aeroelastic problems).
In a subsequent section we brieﬂy outline the generalization to two-dimensional
models. Later this subject will be considered in more depth in the context of dynamic
aeroelasticity.
3.9
Integral Equation Eigenvalue Problem and the
Experimental Determination of Inﬂuence Functions
For the special case of a constant section wing with ‘strip theory’ aerodynamics one
may formulate a standard integral equation eigenvalue problem for the determination
18 This distinction between the two ways in which the aircraft may be restrained received renewed
emphasis in the context of the oblique wing concept. Weisshaar and Ashley [9].

38

of divergence. In itself this problem is of little interest. However, it does lead to some
interesting results with respect to the determination of the structural and aerodynamic
inﬂuence functions by experimental means.
For such a wing,
My = Le + MAC = eqc∂CL
∂α α + · · ·
where the omitted terms are independent of twist and may therefore be ignored for
the divergence (eigenvalue) problem. Also the coefﬁcients of α may be taken as
constants for a constant section wing. Substituting the above expression into the
integral equation of structural equilibrium we have
α(y) = eqc∂CL
∂α
 1
0
Cαα(y, η)α(η)dη
This is an eigenvalue problem in integral form where the eigenvalue is
λ ≡eqc∂CL
∂α
One may solve this problem for the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
which satisfy the equation
αn(y) = λn
 1
0
Cαα(y, η)αn(η)dη
Incidentally, the restriction to a constant section wing was unnecessary and with a
moderate amount of effort one could even use a more sophisticated aerodynamic
model. Such complications are not warranted here.
These eigenfunctions or similar functions may be usefully employed to deter-
mine by experimental means the structural, Cαα, and aerodynamic, Alα, inﬂuence
functions. The former is not as attractive as the use of point unit structural loads as
we shall see; however, the procedure outlined below for the determination of ALα
probably deserves more attention than it has previously received.
Assume the structural inﬂuence function can be expanded in terms of the eigen-
functions
Cαα(y, η) =

n
Cn(y)αn(η)
(3.30)
where the Cn are to be determined. Also recall that

39
and the αn are the eigenfunctions and λn the eigenvalues of Cαα satisfying (3.31)
and an orthogonality condition

αnαmdy = 0
for
m ̸= η
Then multiply (3.30) by αm(η) and integrate over the span of the wing; the result is
Cm(y) =
 1
0 Cαα(y, η)αm(η)dη
 1
0 α2m(η)dη
and from (3.31)
Cmcyl =

Cαα(y, η) =

n
αn(y)αn(η)
λn
 1
0 α2n(η)dη
(3.33)
Thus if the eigenfunctions are known then the Green’s function is readily determined
from (3.33). Normally this holds no special advantage since the determination of the
αn, theoretically or experimentally, is at least as difﬁcult as determining the Green’s
function, Cαα, directly. Indeed as discussed previously if we apply unit moments at
various points along the span the resulting twist distribution is a direct measure of
Cαα. A somewhat less direct way of measuring Cαα is also possible which makes
use of the expansion of the Green’s (inﬂuence) function. Again using (3.30)
Cαα(y, η) =

n
Cnαn(η)
(3.29)
and assuming the αn are orthogonal (although not necessarily eigenfunctions of the
problem at hand) we have
Cn(y) =
 1
0 Cαα(y, η)αn(η)dη
 1
0 α2n(η)dη
(3.34)
Now we have the relation between twist and moment
α(y) =
 1

Cαα(y, η)My(η)dη
(3.35)
Clearly if we use a moment distribution

40

the resulting twist distribution will be (from (3.34))
α(y) = Cn(y)
 1

α2
n(η)dη
(3.36)
Hence we may determine the expansion of the Green’s function by successively
applying moment distribution in the form of the expansion functions and measuring
the resultant twist distribution. For the structural inﬂuence function this offers no
advantage in practice since it is easier to apply point moments rather than moment
distributions.
However, for the aerodynamic Green’s functions the situation is different. In the
latter case we are applying a certain twist to the wing and measuring the resulting
aerodynamic moment distribution. It is generally desirable to maintain a smooth (if
twisted) aerodynamic surface to avoid complications of ﬂow separation and rough-
ness and hence the application of a point twist distribution is less desirable than a
distributed one. We quickly summarize the key relations for determining the aero-
dynamic inﬂuence function. Assume
ALα(y, η) =

(3.37)
We know that
CL(y) =

For orthogonal functions, αn we determine from (3.37) that
ALα
n (y) =
 1
0 ALα(y, η)αndη
 1
0 α2n(η)dη
(3.39)
Applying the twist distribution α = αn(η) to the wing, we see from (3.38) and (3.39)
that the resulting lift distribution is
CL(y) = ALα
n (y)
 1
0
α2
n(η)dη
(3.40)
Hence by measuring the lift distributions on ‘warped wings’ with twist distributions
αn(η) we may completely determine the aerodynamic inﬂuence function in terms of
its expansion (3.37). This technique or a similar one has been used occasionally,19
but not as frequently as one might expect, possibly because of the cost and expense
of testing the number of wings sufﬁcient to establish the convergence of the series.

In this regard, if one uses the αn for a Galerkin or modal expansion solution for the
complete aeroelastic problem one can show that the number of Cn, ALα

required is
equal to the number of modes, αn, employed in the twist expansion.

Two Dimensional Aeroelastic Model of Lifting Surfaces
We consider in turn, structural modeling, aerodynamic modeling, the combining of
the two into an aeroelastic model, and its solution.

Two Dimensional Structures—Integral Representation

w(x, y) =

Cwp(x, y; ξ, η)p(ξ, η)dξ dη
(4.1)
where
w vertical deﬂection at a point, x, y, on plate
p force/area (pressure) at point ξ, η on plate
Cwp deﬂection at x, y due to unit pressure at ξ, η
Note that w and p are taken as positive in the same direction. For the special case
where
w(x, y) = h(y) + xα(y)
(4.2)
and
Cwp(x, y; ξ, η) = ChF(y, η) + xCαF(y, η) + ξChM(y, η) + xξCαM(y, η) (4.3)
with the deﬁnitions
ChF is the deﬂection of y axis at y due to unit force F
CαF is the twist about the y axis at y due to unit force F, etc.,
we may retrieve our beam-rod result. Note that (4.2) and (4.3) may be thought of as
polynomial (Taylor Series) expansions of deﬂections.
Substituting (4.2), (4.3) into (4.1), we have

Equation (4.6) is our previous result. Since for static aeroelastic problems, M is
only a function of α (and not of h), (4.6) may be solved independently of (4.5).
Subsequently (4.6) may be solved to determine h if desired. Equation (4.5) has no
effect on divergence or control surface reversal, of course, and hence we were justiﬁed
in neglecting it in our previous discussion.

(Low Speed) Fluid Flow Over A Flexible Wall
A mathematically similar problem arises when a ﬂexible plate is embedded in an
otherwise rigid surface. See Fig.16. This is a simpliﬁed model of a physical situation
which arises in nuclear reactor heat exchangers, for example. Aeronautical appli-
cations may be found in the local skin deformations on aircraft and missiles. Early
airships may have encountered aeroelastic skin buckling.25
For a one dimensional (beam) structural representation of the wall, the equation
of equilibrium is, as in our previous example,

Hence using this aerodynamic model, there is a formal mathematical analogy to the
previous example and the aeroelastic calculation is the same. For more details and a
more accurate aerodynamic model, the cited references should be consulted.

Sweptwing Divergence
A swept wing, one whose elastic axis is at an oblique angle to an oncoming ﬂuid
stream, offers an interesting variation on the divergence phenomenon. Consider
Fig.17. The angle of sweep is that between the axis perpendicular to the oncom-
ing stream (y axis) and the elastic axis (y axis). It is assumed that the wing can be
modeled by the bending-torsion deformation of a beam-rod. Thus the two structural
equations of equilibrium are

Now consider the aerodynamic model. Consider the velocity diagram, Fig.18. A
strip theory aerodynamic model will be invoked with respect to chords perpendicular
to the y axis. Thus the lift and aerodynamic moment per unit span are given by
¯L = ¯CL ¯cq

¯My = ¯L ¯e + ¯MAC

(6.4)
where ¯q = 1
2ρ(U cos )2 = q cos2 . Also ¯CL is related to the (total) angle of attack,
αT , by
¯CL( ¯y) = ∂¯CL
∂α αT ( ¯y)
(6.5)
where
αT = αe + dh
d ¯y tan 
(6.6)
To understand the basis of the second term in (6.6), consider the velocity diagram of
Fig.19. From this ﬁgure we see the ﬂuid velocity normal to the wing isU sin dh/d ¯y
and thus the effective angle of attack due to bending of a swept wing is

Special cases;

(6.8) then is very similar to the torsional equation for an unswept wing with slightly

As we shall see, divergence in bending alone is possible even for a swept wing which
is very stiff in torsion. This is not possible for an unswept wing.
To illustrate this, consider a further special case, namely a beam with con-
stant spanwise properties. Introducing appropriate non-dimensionalization then (6.9)
becomes

and zero bending moment and shear force at the tip

Equations (6.10)–(6.12) constitute an eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalues of λ are
all negative and the lowest of these provides the divergence condition.

The only way the right hand side of (6.13) can be less than zero is if sin  < 0 or
 < 0.
Thus only swept forward wings can diverge in bending without torsional defor-
mation. This suggests that swept forward wings are more susceptible to divergence
than swept back wings. This proves to be the case when both bending and torsion
are present as well.
For many years, the divergence tendency of swept forward wings precluded their
use. In recent years composite materials provide a mechanism for favorable bending-
torsion coupling which alleviates this divergence. For a modern treatment of these
issues including the effects of composite structures two reports by Weisshaar [16,
17] are recommended reading.
A ﬁnal word on how the eigenvalues are calculated. For (6.10)–(6.12), classical
techniquesforconstantcoefﬁcientdifferentialequationsmaybeemployed.SeeBAH,
pp. 479–489. Even when both bending and torsion are included (6.7), (6.8), if the
wing properties are independent of spanwise location, then classical techniques may
beapplied. Althoughthecalculationdoes becomemoretedious. Finally, for avariable
spanwise properties Galerkin’s method may be invoked, in a similar though more
elaborate manner to that used for unswept wing divergence.

Dynamic Aeroelasticity
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract Dynamic aeroelasticty is considered and the dynamic stability (Flutter)
of linear aeroelastic systems is considered as well as the response to external dis-
turbances including atmospheric turbulence (Gusts). The discussion proceeds from
simpler physical models and mathematical methods to more complex ones. An intro-
duction to the modeling of aerodynamics forces is also provided to prepare the reader
for the material in chapter ‘Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Sur-
faces’.
In static aeroelasticity we have considered various mathematical models of aeroelas-
tic systems. In all of these, however, the fundamental physical content consisted of
two distinct phenomena, ‘divergence’ or static instability, and loss of aerodynamic
effectiveness as typiﬁed by ‘Control surface reversal’. Turning to dynamic aeroe-
lasticity we shall again be concerned with only a few distinct fundamental physical
phenomena. However, they will appear in various theoretical models of increasing
sophistication. The principal phenomena of interest are (1) ‘ﬂutter’ or dynamic insta-
bility and (2) response to various dynamic loadings as modiﬁed by aeroelastic effects.
In the latter category primary attention will be devoted to (external) aerodynamic
loadings such as atmospheric turbulence or ‘gusts’. These loadings are essentially
random in nature and must be treated accordingly. Other loadings of interest may be
impulsive or discrete in nature such as the sudden loading due to maneuvering of a
ﬂight vehicle as a result of control surface rotation.
To discuss these phenomena we must ﬁrst develop the dynamic theoretical models.
This naturally leads us to a discussion of how one obtains the equations of motion
for a given aeroelastic system including the requisite aerodynamic forces. Our initial
discussion of aerodynamic forces will be conceptual rather than detailed. Later,
in chapter ‘Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’, these
forces are developed from the fundamentals of ﬂuid mechanics. We shall begin
by using the ‘typical section’ as a pedagogical device for illustrating the physical
content of dynamic aeroelasticity. Subsequently using the concepts of structural and

aerodynamic inﬂuence and impulse functions, we shall discuss a rather general model
of an aeroelastic system. The solution techniques for our aeroelastic models are for
the most part standard for the modern treatment of the dynamics of linear systems
and again we use the typical section to introduce these methods.
We now turn to a discussion of energy and work methods which have proven very
useful for the development of structural equations of motion. In principle, one may
use Newton’s Second Law (plus Hooke’s Law) to obtain the Equations of motion
for any elastic body. However, normally an alternative procedure based on Hamil-
ton’s Principle or Lagrange’s Equations is used.1 For systems with many degrees of
freedom, the latter are more economical and systematic.
We shall brieﬂy review these methods here by ﬁrst deriving them from Newton’s
Second Law for a single particle and then generalizing them for many particles and/or
a continuous body. One of the major advantages over the Newtonian formulation is
that we will deal with work and energy (scalars) as contrasted with accelerations and
forces (vectors).

Hamilton’s Principle
1.1
Single Particle
Newton’s Law states
⃗F = m d2⃗r
dt2
(1.1)
where ¯F is the force vector and ⃗r is the displacement vector, representing the actual
path of particle. m is the particle mass.
Consider an adjacent path, ⃗r + δ⃗r, where ⃗r is a ‘virtual displacement’ which is
small in some appropriate sense. If the time interval of interest is t = t1 →t2 then
we shall require that
δ⃗r = 0
at
t = t1, t2
although this can be generalized. Thus, the actual and adjacent paths coincide at
t = t1, or t2
Now form the dot product of (1.1) with δ⃗r and
 t2
t1 · · · dt. The result is

work’.The‘virtualwork’isdeﬁnedastheworkdonebytheactualforcesbeingmoved

through the virtual displacement. We assume that the force remains ﬁxed during the
virtualdisplacementor,equivalently,thevirtualdisplacementoccursinstantaneously,
i.e., δt = 0.
It follows that the ﬁrst term must also have the dimensions of work (or energy).
To see this more explicitly, we manipulate the ﬁrst term by an integration by parts as
follows:

is deﬁned as the ‘virtual kinetic energy’ and
δW ≡⃗F · δ⃗r
(1.6)
is the ‘virtual work’. Hence, the problem is cast in the form of scalar quantities, work
and energy. Equation (1.4) is Hamilton’s Principle. It is equivalent to Newton’s Law.
Before proceeding further it is desirable to pause to consider whether we can
reverse our procedure, i.e., starting from (1.4), can we proceed to (1.1)? It is not
immediately obvious that this is possible. After all, Hamilton’s Principle represents
an integrated statement over the time interval of interest while Newton’s Second Law
holds at every instant in time. By formally reversing our mathematical steps however,
we may proceed from (1.4) to (1.2). To take the ﬁnal step from (1.2) to (1.1) we must
recognize that our choice of δ⃗r is arbitrary. Hence, if (1.2) is to hold for any possible
choice of δ⃗r, (1.2) must follow. To demonstrate this we note that, if δ⃗r is arbitrary
and (1.1) were not true, then it would be possible select δ⃗r such that (1.2) would not
be true. Hence (1.2) implies (1.1) if δ⃗r is arbitrary.

⃗ri is the displacement of ith particle, and
⃗Fi is the force acting on ith particle.

(1.10)
where ρ is the density (mass per unit volume), V is the volume, and δW is the virtual
work done by external applied forces and internal elastic forces. For example, if ⃗f
is the vector body force per unit volume and ⃗p the surface force per unit area then
δW =

Potential Energy
In a course of elasticity2 it would be shown that the work done by internal elastic
forces is the negative of the virtual elastic potential energy. The simplest example is
that of an elastic spring. See sketch below.

The force in the spring is
−K x
where the minus sign arises from the fact that the force of the spring on the mass
opposes the displacement, x. The virtual work is

Considering the other extreme, the most complete description of the potential

[σxxϵxx + σxyϵxy + σxyϵxy + · · · ]dV
(1.13)
where σxx is the stress component (analogous to F) and ϵxx is the strain component
(analogous to x), etc.
From this general expression for potential (strain) energy of an elastic body we
may derive some useful results for the bending and twisting of beams and plates.
For the bending of a beam, the usual assumption of plane sections over the beam
cross-section remaining plane leads to a strain-displacement relation of the form
ϵyy = −z ∂2w
∂y2
where z is the vertical coordinate through the beam and w is the vertical displacement
of the beam. Hooke’s Law reads,
σyy = Eϵyy = −Ez ∂2w
∂y2

58
E. H. Dowell
and we assume all other stresses are negligible
σyz = σxy = σxz = σxx = σzz = 0
If we further assume w(x, y, z) = h(y) where y is the lengthwise coordinate axis of
the beam, then
U = 1

In our aeroelastic problems the nonconservative virtual work is a result of aerody-
namic loading. For example, the virtual work due to the aerodynamic pressure (force
per unit area) on a two-dimensional plate is clearly
δWNC =

p δw dx dy
Note that if the deﬂection is taken to be a consequence of a chordwise rigid rotation
about and bending of a spanwise elastic axis located at, say x = 0, then
w = −h(y) −xα(y)

Lagrange’s Equations
Lagrange’s equations may be obtained by reversing the process by which we obtained
Hamilton’s Principle. However to obtain a more general result than simply a retrieval
of Newton’s Second Law we introduce the notion of ‘generalized’ coordinates. A
‘generalized’ coordinate is one which is arbitrary and independent (of other coordi-
nates). A set of ‘generalized’ coordinates is sufﬁcient3 to describe the motion of a
dynamical system. That is, the displacement of a particle or point in a continuous
body may be written
⃗r = ⃗r(q1, qq2, q3, . . . , t)
(2.1)
where qi is the ith generalized coordinate. From (2.1) it follows that
T = T (˙qi, qi, t)
(2.2)
U = U(˙qi, qi, t)
Thus Hamilton’s Principle may be written
 t2

[δ(T −U) + δWNC]dt = 0

readily obtained by using (2.10) and (2.11) in (2.12). Hence, let us ﬁrst consider
the determination of Qh, Qα. To do this we calculate independently the work done
by the aerodynamic forces.

Note the sign convention is that p is positive up, L is positive up and My is positive
nose up. Putting it all together, noting that

we have from Lagrange’s equations
−d
dt (m ˙m + Sα ˙α) −Khh −L = 0
−d
dt (Sα ˙h + Iα ˙α) −Kαα + My = 0
(2.15)
These are the equations of motion for the ‘typical section’ in terms of the particular
coordinates h and α.
Other choices of generalized coordinates are possible; indeed, one of the principal
advantages of Lagrange’s equations is this freedom to make various choices of gen-
eralized coordinates. The choice used above simpliﬁes the potential energy but not
the kinetic energy. If the generalized coordinates were chosen to be the translation
of an rotation about the center of mass the kinetic energy would be simpliﬁed, viz.
T = m

but the potential energy would be more complicated. Also the relevant aerodynamic
moment would be that about the center of mass axis rather than that about the elastic
axis (spring attachment point).
Another choice might be the translation of and rotation about the aerodynamic
center axis though this choice is much less often used than those discussed above.
Finally we note that there is a particular choice of coordinates which leads to
a maximum simpliﬁcation of the inertial and elastic terms (though not necessarily
the aerodynamic terms). These may be determined by making some arbitrary initial
choice of coordinates, e.g., h and α, and then determining the ‘normal modes’ of
the system in terms of of these.4 These ‘normal modes’ provide us with a coordinate
transformation from the initial coordinates, h and α, to the coordinates of maximum
simplicity. We shall consider this matter further subsequently.

Dynamics of the Typical Section Model of An Airfoil
To study the dynamics of aeroelastic systems, we shall use the ‘typical section’5 as
a device for exploring mathematical tools and the physical content associated with
such systems. To simplify matters, we begin by assuming the aerodynamic forces
are given where p(x, t) is the aerodynamic pressure, L, the resultant (lift) force and
My the resultant moment about the elastic axis. See Fig.2. The equations of motion
are
m ¨h + Khh + Sα ¨α = −L
(3.1)
Sα ¨h + Iα ¨α + Kαα = My
(3.2)
where

These are ‘natural frequencies’ of the system for Sα ≡0 as we shall see in a moment.

ω1 and ω2 are again the natural frequencies. HhF, HαF are so-called ‘transfer func-

motion of the structural system under speciﬁed loading. Later on we shall have
occasion to consider ‘aerodynamic transfer functions’ and also ‘aeroelastic transfer
functions’. ω3/ωα is the root of the numerator of HhL (but not in general of HαL

Note that inﬁnite response occurs at the natural frequencies, ω1 and ω2, for both
HhL and HαL. This is not an instability; it is a ‘resonance’ with the inﬁnite response
due to the absence of any damping in the system. Had structural or aerodynamic
damping been included as will be done in later examples, then the transfer functions
would become complex numbers which is a mathematical complication. However,

the magnitude of the transfer functions would remain ﬁnite though large at ω = ω1,
ω2 which is an improvement in the realism of the physical model. With L and M
assumed given, which admittedly is somewhat artiﬁcial, the question of instability
does not arise. We will elaborate on this point later when we discuss the notion of
instability in a more precise way.
From sinusoidal motion we may proceed to periodic (but not necessarily sinu-
soidal) motion.

The above analysis can be generalized to any periodic motion by expanding the
motion into a Fourier (sinusoidal) series. Deﬁne:

results for non-periodic motion.

An interesting alternate form of (3.12) can be obtained by substituting (3.11) into

so-called convolution integral.
Note (3.13) is suitable for treating transient motion; however, a special case of the
Fourier transform is often used for transient motion. This is the Laplace transform.

E. H. Dowell
Both approaches give the same result, of course.
As a simple example we consider the translation of our typical section for Sα ≡0,
i.e., the center of mass coincides with the elastic axis or spring attachment point.
This uncouples the rotation from translation and we need only consider
m ¨h + Khh = −L
(3.1)
We assume a force of the form
L = e−at
for
t > 0

for
t < 0
(3.16)

function as

Using above and the previously obtained transfer function in (3.12) we obtain the
response. The result is, of course, the same as that determined before. Note that in

which is the usual static or steady state response to a force of unit amplitude. The
terms which approach zero for a large time due to structural damping are usually
termed the transient part of the solution. If
a ≪ζhωh
the transient solution dies out rapidly compared to the force and we usually are
interested in the steady state response. If
a ≫ζhωh
the ‘impulsive’ force dies out rapidly and we are normally interested in the transient
response. Frequently the maximum response is of greatest interest. A well known
result is that the peak Dynamic response is approximately twice the static response
if the force persists for a long time and the damping is small. That is, if

A great deal of insight into the dynamics of linear systems can be gained thereby.
The question arises which of the two approaches is to be preferred. The answer
depends upon a number of factors, including the computational efﬁciency and phys-
ical insight desired. Roughly speaking the second approach, which is essentially a
frequency domain approach, is to be preferred when analytical solutions are to be
attempted or physical insight based on the degree of frequency ‘matching’ or ‘mis-
matching’ of HhL and L∗is desired. Clearly a larger response will be obtained if the
maxima of H and L∗occur near the same frequencies, i.e., they are ‘matched’, and
a lesser response will be obtained otherwise, i.e., the maxima are ‘mismatched’. The
ﬁrst approach, which is essentially a time domain approach, is generally to be pre-
ferred when numerical methods are attempted and quantitative accuracy is of prime
importance.
Other variations on these methods are possible. For example the transfer function,
HhL, and the impulse function, IhL, may be determined experimentally. Also the
impulse function may be determined directly from the equation of motion, bypassing
any consideration of the transfer function. To illustrate this latter remark, consider
our simple example
m ¨h + Khh = −L
(3.1)
The impulse function is the response for h due to L(t) = δ(t). Hence, it must satisfy
m ¨Ihl + Kh Ihl = −δ(t)
(3.20)
Let us integrate the above from t = 0 to ϵ.

or

In the limit as ϵ →0+, we obtain the ‘initial condition’,
˙Ihl(0+) = −1
m
(3.21)

Dynamic Aeroelasticity
73
and also
˙Ihl(0+) = 0
Hence, solving (3.20) and using the initial velocity condition, (3.21), we obtain
Ihl = −1
mωh
sin ωht
for
t > 0
(3.17)
which is the same result obtained previously.
Finally, all of these ideas can be generalized to many degrees of freedom. In
particular using the concept of ‘normal modes’ any multi-degree-of-freedom system
can be reduced to a system of uncoupled single-degree-of-freedom systems.8 As will
become clear, when aerodynamic forces are present the concept of normal modes
which decouple the various degrees of freedom is not as easily applied and one must
usually deal with all the degrees of freedom which are of interest simultaneously.
3.4
Random Motion
A random motion is by deﬁnition one whose response is neither repeatable nor whose
details are of great interest. Hence attention is focused on certain averages, usually the
mean value and also the mean square value. The mean value may be treated as a static
loading and response problem and hence we shall concentrate on the mean square
relations which are the simplest characterization of random, dynamic response.
Relationship between mean values. To see the equivalence between mean value
Dynamic response and static response, consider
h(t) =

and take the mean of both sides (here a bar above the quantity denotes its mean,
which should not be confused with that symbol’s previous use in our discussion of
sinusoidal motion). By deﬁnition

which is just the usual static relationship between h and L. Unfortunately, no such
simple relation exists between the mean square values. Instead all frequency com-
ponents of the transfer function, Hhl, contribute. Because of this it proves useful to
generalize the deﬁnition of a square mean.
Relationship between mean square values. A more general and informative quantity

−T
L(t)L(t + τ)dt
(3.22)
The mean square of L, ¯L2, is given by
¯L2 = φLL(τ = 0)
(3.23)
As τ →∞, φLL →0 if L is truly a random function since L(t) and L(t + τ) will
be ‘uncorrelated’. Indeed, a useful check on the randomness of L is to examine φ for
large τ. Analogous to (3.22), we may deﬁne

interest, the ‘power spectra’,

(3.25)
(Note that a factor of two difference exists in (3.25) from the usual Fourier transform

(3.27)
Hence a knowledge of LL is sufﬁcient to determine the mean square. It turns out
to be most convenient to relate the power spectra of L to that of h and use (3.27) or
its counterpart for h to determine the mean square values.
To relate the power spectra, it is useful to start with a substitution of (3.13) into
the ﬁrst of (3.24).

but we shall not pursue this here. Instead the frequency domain analysis is pursued
further.
It is useful to consider the preceding calculation in graphical form for a moment.
The (square of the) transfer function is plotted in Fig.4. and the gust power spectral
density in Fig.5.
We note that the power spectral density is slowly varying with w relative to the
square of the transfer function which peaks sharply near ω = ωh. Hence one may, to
a close approximation, take the power spectral density as a constant with its value
determined at ω = ωh in computing the mean square response. This is a simple
but powerful idea which carries over to many degrees-of-freedom, and hence many
resonances, provided the resonant frequencies of the transfer function are known.
For some aeroelastic systems, locating the resonances may prove difﬁcult.

There are other difﬁculties with the approach which should be pointed out. First
of all we note that including the (aerodynamic) damping due to motion is neces-
sary to obtain a physically meanful result.Without it the computed response would
be inﬁnite! Hence, an accurate evaluation of the effective damping for an aeroe-
lastic system is essential in random response studies. It is known that in general
the available aerodynamic theories are less reliable for evaluating the (out-of-phase
with displacement) damping forces than those forces in-phase with displacement.15
Another difﬁculty may arise if instead of evaluating the mean square displacement
response we instead seek to determine the mean square of acceleration. The latter
quantity is frequently of greater interest from the standpoint of design. The relevant
transfer function is given by
H¨hwG = (iω)2HhwG
(3.43)
and the mean square is therefore

(3.44)
If we make the same approximation as before that wGwG is a constant, we are in
difﬁculty because |H¨hwG|2 does not approach zero as ω →∞and hence the inte-
gral formally diverges. This means greater care must be exercised in evaluating the
integral and in particular considering the high frequency behavior of the gust power
spectral density. Also, one may need to use a more elaborate aerodynamic theory.
In the present example we have used a quasi-steady aerodynamic theory which
is reasonably accurate for low frequencies;16 however, to evaluate the acceleration
response it will frequently be necessary to use a full unsteady aerodynamic theory
in order to obtain accurate results a high frequencies in (3.44).
Measurement of power spectra. We brieﬂy digress to consider an important applica-
tion of (3.27) to the experimental determination of power spectra. For deﬁniteness
consider the measurement of gust power spectra. Analogous to (3.27) we have

It is assumed that a device is available to measure wG over a useful range of frequen-
cies. The electronic signal from this device is then sent to an electronic ‘ﬁlter’. The
latter, in its most ideal form, has a transfer function given by

Flutter—An Introduction to Dynamic Aeroelastic
Instability
The most dramatic physical phenomenon in the ﬁeld of aeroelasticity is ﬂutter, a
dynamic instability which often leads to catastrophic structural failure. One of the
difﬁculties in studying this phenomenon is that it is not one but many. Here we
shall introduce one type of ﬂutter using the typical section structural model and
a steady ﬂow aerodynamic model. The latter is a highly simplifying assumption
whose accuracy we shall discuss in more detail later. From (3.1) and with a steady

∂α α = 0
Iα ¨α + Sα ¨h + Kαα −qSe∂CL
∂α α = 0
(3.48)
To investigate the stability of this system we assume solutions of the form
h = ¯hept
α = ¯αept
(3.49)
and determine the possible values of p, which are in general complex numbers. If
the real part of any value of p is positive, then the motion diverges exponentially
with time, (cf. (3.49)), and the typical section is unstable.
To determine p, substitute (3.49) into (3.48) and use matrix notation to obtain

Consider in turn two possibilities, B > 0 and B < 0.
B > 0: Then the values of p2 from (3.52) are real and negative provided
B2 −4AC > 0
and hence the values of p are purely imaginary, representing neutrally stable oscil-
lations. On the other hand if
B2 −4AC < 0
the values of p2 are complex and hence at least one value of p will have a positive
real part indicating an unstable motion. Thus
B2 −4AC = 0
(3.54)
gives the boundary between neutrally stable and unstable motion. From (3.54) one
may compute an explicit value of q at which the dynamic stability, ‘ﬂutter’, occurs,
i.e.,

F + EqF + F = 0
or

In order for ﬂutter to occur at least one of the qF determined by (3.55) must be real
and positive. If both are, the smaller of the two is the more critical; if neither are,
ﬂutter does not occur. Pines17 has studied this example in some detail and derived a
number of interesting results. Perhaps the most important of these is that for
17 Pines [8].

Dynamic Aeroelasticity
83
Sα ≤0
i.e., the center of gravity is ahead of the elastic axis, no ﬂutter occurs. Conversely
as Sα increases in a positive sense the dynamic pressure at which ﬂutter occurs qF
is decreased. In practice, mass is often added to a ﬂutter prone structure so as to
decrease Sα and raise qF. Such a structure is said to have been ‘mass balanced’. Now
consider the other possibility for B.
B < 0: B is positive for q ≡0 (cf. (3.51) et. seq.) and will only become negative for
sufﬁciently large q. However, the condition
B2 −4AC = 0
will occur before
B = 0
since A > 0, C > 0. Hence, to determine when ﬂutter occurs, only B > 0 need be
considered.
In concluding this discussion, let us study the effect of Sα in more detail following
Pines.
Consider the ﬁrst special case Sα = 0. Then
D =


2
E = 2me{IαKh −mKα}S ∂CL
∂α
F = {mKα −Kh Iα}2
and one may show that
E2 −4DF = 0
Using this result and also (3.55) and (2.18), it is determined that
qF/qD = 1 −ω2
h/ω2
α
(3.56)
Thus if qd < 0 and ωh/ωα < 1, qF < 0, i.e., no ﬂutter will occur. Conversely if
qD > 0 and ωh/ωα > 1, then qF < 0 and again no ﬂutter will occur.
Now consider the general case, Sα ̸= 0. Note that D > 0 and F > 0 for all param-
eter values. Thus from (3.55), qF < 0 if E > 0 and no ﬂutter will occur. After some
rearrangement of the expression for E, it is found that (in non-dimensional form)

From this equation, the condition for no ﬂutter, E > 0 or ¯E > 0, gives the following
results.
• If xcg = 0, then no ﬂutter occurs for e > 0 and ωh/ωα > 1 or for e < 0 and
ωh/ωα < 1.
• If e = 0, then no ﬂutter occurs for xcg < 0 and any ωh/ωα.
• For small xcg, i.e., if

then ¯E > 0 implies
e[−1 + (ωh/ωα)2]
[1 + (ωh/ωα)2] −xcg > 0
For ωh/ωα small (the usual case), this implies
−e −xcg > 0
while for wh/wα large, this implies
e −xcg > 0
as the conditions for no ﬂutter.
3.6
Quasi-Steady, Aerodynamic Theory
Often it is necessary to determine p by numerical methods as a function of q in order
to evaluate ﬂutter. For example, if one uses the slightly more complex ‘quasi-steady’
aerodynamic theory which includes the effective angle of attack contribution, ˙h/U,

Since the values of p are complex conjugates only half of them are shown. The
solid lines are for the ˙h/U or aerodynamic damping effect included and the dash
lines for it omitted. There are several interesting points to be made.
(1) With aerodynamic damping omitted the typical section model is neutrally stable
until U = UF. For U = UF the bending and torsion frequencies merge and for
U > UF the system is unstable.
(2) With aerodynamic damping included, for small U all values of p are stable and
ﬂutter occurs at sufﬁciently large U where pR changes sign from negative to
positive. There is a tendency for the frequencies to merge but complete merging
does not occur.
(3) In this example for this approximate aerodynamic theory, the addition of aerody-
namic damping reduces the ﬂutter velocity UF. This last result has been a source
of consternation (and research papers). Whether it occurs in the real physical
problem or whether it is a consequence of our simpliﬁed theoretical model is
not known. No experiment has yet been performed where the aerodynamic (or
structural) damping has been systematically varied to verify or refute this result.

Finallywementiononefurthergeneralcomplicationwhichcommonlyoccursinanal-
ysis. When even more elaborate, fully unsteady aerodynamic theories are employed,
the aerodynamic forces are usually only conveniently known for neutrally stable
motion, i.e.,
p = iω,
pR ≡0
Hence, indirect or iterative methods are usually required to effect a solution for
U = UF and often no information is obtained for U < UF or U > UF. We shall
return to this issue later.

Aerodynamic Forces for Airfoils-An Introduction and
Summary
Having developed the mathematical tools for treating the dynamics of our aeroelastic
system, we now turn to a topic previously deferred, the determination of the aero-
dynamic forces. Usually, we wish to relate the aerodynamic lift and moment to the
motion of the airfoil. In order not to break unduly the continuity of our discussion of
aeroelastic phenomena, we give a brief summary of known results here and defer a
discussion of the aerodynamic theory from ﬁrst principles until chapter ‘Nonsteady
Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’.
From aerodynamic theory we know that the motion appears in the aerodynamic
force relation through the ‘downwash’, wa i.e.,
wα ≡∂za
∂t + U∞
∂za
∂x
(4.1)
where za is vertical displacement of airfoil at point x, y at time t. We shall not give
a formal derivation of (4.1) here but shall indicate the physical basis from which
it follows. For an inviscid ﬂuid the boundary condition at a ﬂuid-solid interface,
e.g., at the surface of an airfoil, requires that the ﬂuid velocity component normal
to the surface be equal to the normal velocity of the surface on the instantaneous
position of the surface. (If we have a nearly planar solid surface undergoing small
motions relative to its own dimensions we may apply the boundary condition on some
average position of the body, say z = 0, rather than on the instantaneous position
of the surface, z = za.) In a coordinate system ﬁxed with respect to the ﬂuid the
boundary condition would read
wa = ∂za
∂t
where wa is the normal ﬂuid velocity component, the so-called ‘downwash’, and ∂za
∂t
is the normal velocity of the body surface. In a coordinate system ﬁxed with respect
to the body there is an additional convection term as given in (4.1). This may be
derived by a formal transformation from ﬁxed ﬂuid to ﬁxed body axes.

Dynamic Aeroelasticity
87
Finally if in addition to the mean ﬂow velocity, U∞, we also have a vertical gust
velocity, wG, then the boundary condition is that the total normal ﬂuid velocity at
the body surface be equal to the normal body velocity, i.e.,
wtotal ≡wa + wG = ∂za
∂t + U∞
∂za
∂x
where wa is the additional ﬂuid downwash due to the presence of the airfoil beyond
that given by the prescribed gust downwash wG. The pressure loading on the airfoil
is
p + pG
where p is the pressure due to
wa = −wG(x, t) + ∂za
∂t + U∞
∂za
∂x
and pG is the prescribed pressure corresponding to the given wG. Note, however,
that pG is continuous through z = 0 and hence gives no net pressure loading on
the airfoil. Thus, only the pressure p due to downwash wa is of interest in most
applications.
For the typical section airfoil example,
za = −h −αx
(4.2)
and
wa = −wG −˙h −˙αx −Uα


 α
From the ﬁrst and last terms we note that wG
U∞is in some sense equivalent to an angle
of attack, although it is an angle of attack which varies with position along the airfoil,
wG = wG(x, t)!
Using the concept of aerodynamic impulse functions, we may now relate lift and
moment to h, α and wG. For simplicity let us neglect wG for the present.
The aerodynamic force and moment can be written

Equation (4.3) is the aerodynamic analog to (3.13). Note that ˙h + U∞α always
appear in the same combination in wa from (4.2). It is conventional to express (4.3)
in nondimensional form. Thus,

Remember that ‘transfer functions’, aerodynamic or otherwise, may be determined
from a consideration of sinusoidal motion only. Also note that (4.2), (4.3) and (4.7)
are written for pitching about an axis x = 0. That is, the origin of the coordinate
system is taken as the pitch axis. By convention, in aerodynamic analysis the origin
of the coordinate system is usually taken at mid-chord. Hence
za = −h −α(x −xe.a.)
(4.2)
wa = −˙h −˙α(x −xe.a.) −U∞α

In the following table we summarize the state-of-the-art for the aerodynamic

This is a local, zero memory relation in that the pressure at position x, y at time t
depends only on the motion at the same position and time and does not depend upon
the motion at other positions (local effect) or at previous times (zero memory effect).
This is sometimes referred to as aerodynamic ‘piston theory’18 since the pressure is

This pressure-velocity relation has been widely used in recent years in aeroelasticity
and is also well known in one-dimensional plane wave acoustic theory. Impulse and

Here δ is the delta function and D the doublet function, the latter being the derivative
of a delta function. In practice, one would use (4.8) rather than (4.4) since delta and
doublet functions are not suitable for numerical integration, etc. However, (4.8) and
(4.4) are formally equivalent using (4.9) Note that (4.8) is more amenable to physical
interpretation also. The terms outside the integral involving ¨h and ¨α may be identiﬁed
as inertial terms, sometimes called ‘virtual mass’ terms. These are usually negligible
compared to the inertial terms of the airfoil itself if the ﬂuid is air.20 The quantity

may be identiﬁed as the downwash at the 3

4 chord has been
given a special place for two-dimensional, incompressible ﬂow. Finally, note that
the ‘aerodynamic impulse functions’, ILh, ILi, can be expressed entirely in terms of
a single function φ, the so-called Wagner function.21 This function is given below in
Fig.7. A useful approximate formulae is

For Mach numbers greater than zero, the compressibility of the ﬂow smooths out
the delta and doublet functions of (4.9) and no such simple form as (4.8) exists.
Hence, only for incompressible ﬂow is the form, (4.8), particularly useful. Finally,
we should mention that analogous impulse functions exist for gust loading due to
gust vertical velocity, wG.

The Wagner and Kussner functions have been widely employed for transient aerody-
namic loading of airfoils. Even for compressible, subsonic ﬂow they are frequently
used with empirical corrections for Mach number effects. Relatively simple, exact

formulae exist for two-dimensional, supersonic ﬂow also.22 However, for subsonic
and/or three-dimensional ﬂow the aerodynamic impulse functions must be deter-
mined by fairly elaborate numerical means. Finally we note that (4.11) may be

Equations (4.7) and (4.13) will be useful when we treat the gust problem as a random
process and make use of power spectral techniques. For further discussion of gust
aerodynamics, see Sects.2 and 3.
4.2
General Approximations
Frequently simplifying assumptions are made with respect to the spatial or temporal
dependence of the aerodynamic forces. Here we discuss three widely used approxi-
mations.
4.2.1
‘Strip Theory’ Approximation
In this approximation, one employs the known results for two-dimensional ﬂow
(inﬁnite span airfoil) to calculate the aerodynamic forces on a lifting surface of ﬁnite
span. The essence of the approximation is to consider each spanwise station as though
it were a portion of an inﬁnite span wing with uniform spanwise properties. Therefore
the lift (or, more generally, chordwise pressure distribution) at any spanwise station is
assumed to depend only on the downwash at that station as given by two-dimensional
aerodynamic theory and to be independent of the downwash at any other spanwise
station.
4.2.2
‘Quasisteady’ Approximation
The strip theory approximation discussed above is unambiguous and its meaning is
generally accepted. Unfortunately, this is not true for the quasi-steady approximation.
Its qualitative meaning is generally accepted, i.e., one ignores the temporal memory
effect in the aerodynamic model and assumes the aerodynamic forces at any time
depend only on the motion of the airfoil at that same time and are independent of
22 See BAH, pp. 367–375, for a traditional approach and chapter ‘Nonsteady Aerodynamics of
Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’ for an approach via Laplace and Fourier Transforms.

94
E. H. Dowell
the motion at earlier times. That is, the history of the motion is neglected as far
as determining aerodynamic forces. For example, the piston theory aerodynamic
approximation is inherently a quasi-steady approximation.
As an example of the ambiguity that can develop in constructing a quasi-steady
approximation, consider the aerodynamic forces for two-dimensional, incompress-
ible ﬂow, e.g., see (4.8). One such approximation which is sometimes used is to
approximate the Wagner function by
φ = 1
and hence
φ(0) = 1,
˙φ = 0
This is clearly a quasi-steady model since the convolution integral in (4.8) may now
be evaluated in terms of the airfoil motion at the present time, s ≡tU∞
b , and thus the
aerodynamic forces are independent of the history of the airfoil motion.
An alternate quasi-steady approximation which is used on occasion is to ﬁrst
obtain the aerodynamic forces for steady motion, e.g., only those terms which involve
α in (4.8)and then to deﬁne an equivalent unsteady angle of attack.
α + dh
dt

U∞
to replace α everywhere in the steady aerodynamic theory. Clearly this second quasi-
steady approximation is different from the ﬁrst. (An interesting and relatively short
exercise for the reader is to work out and compare these two approximations in detail
using (4.8).) However, both are used in practice and the reader should be careful to
determine exactly what a given author means by ‘quasi-steady approximation’.
The ambiguity could be removed if there were general agreement that what is
meant by the quasi-steady approximation is an expansion in reduced frequency for
sinusoidal airfoil motion. However, even then, there would have to be agreement
as to the number of terms to be retained in the expansion. (Recall that powers of
frequency formally correspond to time derivatives.)
4.3
Slender Body or Slender (Low Aspect Ratio) Wing
Approximation
Another approximation based upon spatial considerations is possible when the lift-
ing surface is of low aspect ratio or one is dealing with a slender body. In such
cases the chordwise spatial rates of change (derivatives) may be neglected com-
pared to spanwise rates of change and hence the chordwise coordinate effectively
becomes a parameter rather than an independent coordinate. This approach is gen-

erally attributed to R. T. Jones.23 It is useful as an asymptotic check on numerical
methods for slender bodies and low aspect ratio wings. However it is useful for
quantitative predictions for only a modest range of practical lifting surfaces.
A particulary interesting result is available for the external ﬂow about a slender
body when the body has rigid cross-sections and deforms only in the direction, i.e.,
za(x, y, t) = za(x, t)

external and internal ﬂows.25

Solutions to the Aeroelastic Equations of Motion
With the development of the aerodynamic relations, we may now turn to the question
of solving the aeroelastic equations of motion. Substituting (4.4) into (3.1) and (3.2),
these equations become:

and IL ˙h, etc. are nondimensional impulse functions. Equation (5.1) are linear,
differential-integral equations for h and α. They may be solved in several ways, all of
which involve a moderate amount of numerical work. Basically, we may distinguish
between those methods which treat the problem in time domain and those which
work in the frequency domain. The possibilities are numerous and we shall discuss
representative examples of solution techniques rather than attempt to be exhaustive.
5.1
Time Domain Solutions
In this day and (computer) age, perhaps the most straightforward way of solving
(5.1) (and similar equations which arise for more complicated aeroelastic systems)
is by numerical time integration using ﬁnite differences. Such integration is normally
done on a digital computer. A simpliﬁed version of the procedure follows:
Basically, we seek a step by step solution for the time history of the motion. In
particular, given the motion at some time, t, we wish to be able to obtain the motion
at some later time, t + t. In general t must be sufﬁciently small;just how small
we will discuss in a moment. In relating the solution at time, t + t, to that at time,
t, we use the idea of a Taylor series, i.e.,

α(t + t) = α(t) + dα(t)
dt
t + 1
2
d2α(t)
dt2
(t) + · · ·
(5.2)
If we think of starting the solution at the initial instant, t = 0, we see that normally
h(0), dh(0)/dt, α(0), dα(0)/dt, are given as initial conditions since we are dealing
with (two) second order equations for h and alpha. However, in general, d2h(0)/dt2,
d2α(0)/dt2 and all higher order derivatives are not speciﬁed. They can be determined
though from equations of motion themselves, (5.1). Equation (5.1) are two algebraic
equations for d2h/dt2, d2α/dt2, in terms of lower order derivatives. Hence, they
may readily be solved for d2h/dt2, d2α/dt2. Moreover, by differentiating (5.1)
successively the higher order derivatives may also be determined, e.g., d3h/dt3, etc.
Hence, by using the equations of motion themselves the terms in the Taylor Series
may be evaluated, (5.2), and h at t = t determined. Repeating this procedure, the
time history may be determined at t = 2t, 3t, 4t, etc.
The above is the essence of the procedure. However, there are many variations on
this basic theme and there are almost as many numerical integration schemes as there
are people using them.26 This is perhaps for two reasons: (1) an efﬁcient scheme is
desired (this involves essentially a trade-off between the size of t and the number of
terms retained in the series, (5.2), or more generally a trade-off between t and the
complexity of the algorithm relating h(t + t) to h(t)); (2) some schemes including
the one outlined above, are numerically unstable (i.e., numerical errors grow expo-
nentially) if t is too large. This has led to a stability theory for difference schemes
to determine the critical t and also the development of difference schemes which
are inherently stable for all t. Generally speaking, a simple difference scheme such
as the one described here will be stable if t is small compared to the shortest natu-
ral period of the system, say one-tenth or so. A popular method which is inherently
stable for all t is due to Houbolt.27
Finally, analytical solutions or semi-analytical solutions may be obtained under
certain special circumstances given sufﬁcient simpliﬁcation of the system dynamics
and aerodynamics. These are usually obtained via a Laplace Transform. Since the
Laplace Transform is a special case of the Fourier transform, we defer a discussion
of this topic to the following section on frequency domain solutions.
5.2
Frequency Domain Solutions
An alternative procedure to the time domain approach is to treat the problem in the
frequency domain. This approach is more popular and widely used today than the
time domain approach. Perhaps the most important reason for this is the fact that

the aerodynamic theory is much more completely developed for simple harmonic
motion that for arbitrary time dependent motion. That is, the unsteady aerodynamicist
normally provides HL ˙h, for example, rather than IL ˙h. Of course, these two quantities
form a Fourier transform pair,

 ∞

(5.3)
where
k ≡ωb
U ,
s ≡tU

and, in principle, given HL ˙h one can compute IL ˙h(s). However, for the more complex
(and more accurate) aerodynamic theories HL ˙h is a highly oscillatory function which
is frequently only known numerically at a relatively small number of frequencies, k.
Hence, although there have been attempts to obtain IL ˙h by a numerical integration
of HL ˙h over all frequency, they have not been conspicuously successful. Fortunately,
for a determination of the stability characteristics of a system, e.g., ﬂutter speed, one
need only consider the frequency characteristics of the system dynamics, per se, and
may avoid such integrations.
Another reason for the popularity of the frequency domain method is the powerful
power spectral description of random loads such as gust loads, landing loads (over
randomly rough surfaces), etc. These require a frequency domain description. Recall
(3.25) and (3.40).
The principal disadvantage of the frequency domain approach is that one performs
two separate calculations; one, to assess the system stability, ‘ﬂutter’, and a second,
to determine the response to external loads such as gusts, etc. This will become
clearer as we discuss the details of the procedures.
Let us now turn to the equations of motion, (5.1), and convert them to the frequency
domain by taking the Fourier transform of these equations. The result is

It is left to the reader to evaluate these transfer functions explicitly from (5.5). Note
these are aeroelastic transfer functions as opposed to the purely mechanical or struc-
tural transfer functions, HhF and HαF, considered previously or the purely aero-
dynamic transfer functions, HL ¯h, etc. That is, HhG include not only the effects of
structural inertia and stiffness, but also the aerodynamic forces due to structural
motion.

Compare (5.9) and (5.10) with (3.13) and (3.14). As mentioned in our discussion
of time domain solutions, the integrals over frequency may be difﬁcult to evaluate
because of the oscillatory nature of the aerodynamic forces.
Finally, for random gust velocities one may write
(h/b)(h/b) = |HhG(ω)|2(wg/U)(wG/U)
(5.11)
where (h/b)(h/b), (wg/U)(wG/U), are the (auto) power spectra of h

Compare (5.12) with (3.25). Since the transfer function is squared, the integral (5.12)
may be somewhat easier to evaluate than (5.7) or (5.10). The gust velocity power
spectra is generally a smoothly varying function. Equation (5.12) is commonly used
in applications.
To evaluate stability, ‘ﬂutter’, of the system one need not evaluate any of these
integrals over frequency. It sufﬁces to consider the eigenvalues (or poles) of the
transfer function. A pole of the transfer function, ωp, will give rise to an aeroelastic
impulse function of the form
IhG ∼eiωpt = ei(ωp)Rte−(ωp)I t
see (5.10). Hence, the system will be stable if the imaginary part, (ωp)I, of all poles
is positive. If any one (or more) pole has a negative imaginary part, the system is
unstable, i.e., it ﬂutters. The frequency of oscillation is (ωp)R, the real part of the
pole. Note that the poles are also the eigenvalues of the determinant of coefﬁcients
of ¯h and ¯α in (5.5).
Having developed the mathematical techniques for treating dynamic aeroelastic
problems we will now turn to a discussion of results and some of the practical aspects
of such calculations.

Representative Results and Computational
Considerations
We will conﬁne ourselves to two important types of motion, ‘ﬂutter’ and ‘gust
response’.
6.1
Time Domain
If we give the typical section (or any aeroelastic system) an initial disturbance due
to an impulsive force, the resultant motion may take one of two possible forms as
shown in Figs.9 and 10. ‘Flutter’ is the more interesting of these two motions, since,
if it is present, it will normally lead to catastrophic structural failure which will result
in the loss of the ﬂight vehicle. All ﬂight vehicles are carefully analyzed for ﬂutter
and frequently the structure is stiffened to prevent ﬂutter inside the ﬂight envelope
of the vehicle.
Even if ﬂutter does not occur, however, other motions in response to continuous
external forces may be of concern with respect to possible structural failure. An
important example is the gust response of the ﬂight vehicle. Consider a vertical gust
velocity time history as shown in Fig.11. The resulting ﬂight vehicle motion will
have the form shown in Fig.12. Note that the time history of the response has a
certain well deﬁned average period or frequency with modulated, randomly varying
amplitude. The more random input has been ‘ﬁltered’ by the aeroelastic transfer
function and only that portion of the gust velocity signal which has frequencies near
the natural frequencies of the ﬂight vehicle will be identiﬁable in the response. This
characteristic is perhaps more readily seen in the frequency domain than in the time
domain.

Frequency Domain
To assess ﬂutter, we need only examine the poles of the transfer function. This is
similar to a ‘root locus’ plot.28 Typically, the real, wR, and imaginary, wI, parts of the
complex frequency are plotted versus ﬂight speed. For the typical section there will
be two principal poles corresponding to two degrees of freedom and at small ﬂight
speed or ﬂuid velocity, these will approach the natural frequencies of the mechanical
or structural system.See Fig.13. Flutter is identiﬁed by the lowest airspeed for which
one of the wI becomes negative. Note the coming together or ‘merging’ of the wR of
the two poles which is typical of some types of ﬂutter . There are many variations on
the above plot in practice but we shall defer a more complete discussion until later.

polesweresketchedpreviously.ForU = UF thetwopeakswouldessentiallycollapse
into one and the amplitude becomes inﬁnite. For U > UF the amplitude predicted
by the analytical model would become ﬁnite again for the power spectral approach
and this physically unrealistic result is a possible disadvantage of the method.

Here we shall study some of the important parameters which affect ﬂutter and gust
response of the typical action as well as more complex ﬂight vehicles.

we can control the parameters, xα, rα, etc., by the design of our airfoil and choice
of where and how we ﬂy it. For some combination of parameters the airfoil will be
dynamically unstable, i.e., it will ‘ﬂutter’.
An alternative parametric representation would be to assume sinusoidal motion

If for some combination of parameters, ωI < 0, the system ﬂutters.
Several types of ﬂutter are possible. Perhaps these are most easily distinguished on
the basis of the eigenvalues, ωR/ωα, ωI/ωα and their variation with airspeed, U/bωα.
Examples are shown below of the several possibilities with brief discussions of each.
In one type of ﬂutter (called coupled mode or bending-torsion ﬂutter) the distin-
guishing feature is the coming together of two (or more) frequencies, ωR, near the
ﬂutter condition, ωI →0 and U →UF. See Fig.17. For ‘Coalescense’ or Merging

the corresponding ωR remain nearly the same. Although one usually speaks of the
torsion mode as being unstable and the bending mode stable, the airfoil normally is
undergoing a ﬂutter oscillation composed of important contributions of both h and
α. For this type of ﬂutter the out-of-phase or damping forces of the structure or ﬂuid
are not qualitatively important. Often one may neglect structural damping entirely
in the model and use a quasi-steady or even a quasi-static aerodynamic assumption.
This simpliﬁes the analysis and, perhaps more importantly, leads to generally accu-
rate and reliable results based on theoretical calculations.
‘Single-Degree-of-Freedom’ Flutter
In another type of ﬂutter, the distinguishing feature is the virtual independence of the
frequencies, ωR, with respect to variations in airspeed, U/bωα. See Fig.18. Moreover
the change in the true damping, ωI, with airspeed is also moderate. However, above
some airspeed one of the modes (usually torsion) which has been slightly positively
damped becomes slightly negatively damped leading to ﬂutter. This type of ﬂutter
is very sensitive to structural and aerodynamic out-of phase or damping forces.
Since these forces are less well described by theory than the in-phase forces, the
corresponding ﬂutter analysis generally gives less reliable results. One simpliﬁcation
for this type of ﬂutter is the fact that the ﬂutter mode is virtually the same as one of
the system natural modes at zero airspeed and thus the ﬂutter mode and frequency
(though not ﬂutter speed!) are predicted rather accurately by theory. Airfoil blades
in turbomachinery and bridges in a wind often encounter this type of ﬂutter.
There is yet another one-degree-of-freedom type of ﬂutter, but of a very special
type. The ﬂutter frequency is zero and hence this represents the ‘Divergence’ or
‘Zero Frequency’ Flutter.

Static instability which we have previously analyzed in our discussion of static
aeroelasticity under the name of ‘divergence’. See Fig.19. Because it is a static type
of instability, out-of-phase forces are again unimportant and the theory is generally
reliable.
We note that in all of the above we have considered only positive ωR even though
there are negative ωR as well and these are physically meaningful. There are at
least two reasons why this practice is usually followed. For those models where the
aerodynamic transfer functions can be (approximately) expressed as a polynomial
in p ≡iω, the negative ωR plane is (nearly) the mirror image of the positive ωR
plane and the ωI are identical, i.e., all poles are complex conjugates in p. Secondly,
some of the structural damping models employed in ﬂutter analysis are only valid for
ωR < 0; hence, the ωR < 0 in such cases cannot be interpreted in a physically valid

way. However, there are some types of travelling wave ﬂutter in planes and shells for
which a consideration of negative ωR is essential. In such cases a change in sign of
ωR represents a change in direction of a travelling wave.
Flutter Calculations in Practice
At this point it should be emphasized that, in practice, one or another of several
indirect methods is often used to compute the ﬂutter velocity, e.g., the so called
‘V −g method’. In this approach structural damping is introduced by multiplying
the structural frequencies squared
ω2
h, ω2
α
by 1 + ig where g is a structural coefﬁcient and pure sinusoidal motion is assumed,
i.e., ω = ωR with ωI ≡0. For a given U, the g is that required to sustain pure
sinusoidal motion for each aeroelastic mode. The computational advantage of this
approach is that the aerodynamic forces only need be determined for real frequen-
cies. The disadvantage is the loss of physical insight. For example, if a system (with
no structural damping ) is stable at a given airspeed, U, all the values of g so deter-
mined will be negative, but these values of g cannot be interpreted directly in terms
of ωI. Moreover, for a given system with some prescribed damping, only at one
airspeed U = UF (where ω = ωR and ωI ≡0) will the mathematical solution be
physically meaningful. The limitations of the ‘V −g method’ are fully appreciated
by experienced practitioners and it is a measure of the difﬁculty of determining the
aerodynamic forces for other than pure sinusoidal motion, that this method remains
very popular. Here we digress from our main discussion to consider this and related
methods in some detail.
For sinusoidal motion
h = ¯heiωt
α = ¯αeiωt
L = ¯Leiωt
My = ¯Myeiωt
The aerodynamic forces (due to motion only) can be expressed as
¯L = 2ρ∞b2ω2(2b)

(6.3)
This form of aerodynamic forces is somewhat different from that previously used
in this text and is only one of several (equivalent) alternative forms employed in the
literature. Here L1, L2, L3, L4 are (nondimensional) real aerodynamic coefﬁcients

109
which are functions of reduced frequency and Mach number. L1, L2, L3, L4 are the
forms in which the coefﬁcients are generally tabulated for supersonic ﬂow.29
Using the above aerodynamic forms for ¯L and ¯My in (74) and setting the determi-
nant of coefﬁcients of ¯h and ¯α to zero to determine nontrivial solutions, one obtains

(6.4)
Because L1, L2, etc. are complicated, transcendental functions of k (and M) which
are usually only known for real values of k (and hence real values of ω), often one
does not attempt to determine from (6.4) the complex eigenvalue, ω = ωR + iωI.
Instead one seeks to determine the conditions of neutral stability when w is purely
real. Several alternative procedures are passible; two are described below.
In the ﬁrst the following parameters are chosen.
ωh
ωα
,rα, xα, M and (a real value of)k
Equation (6.4) is then a complex equation whose real and imaginary parts may be
used independently to determine the two (real) unknowns
 ω

and
m
2ρ∞bS
From the imaginary part of (6.4), which is a linear equation in these two unknowns,
one may solve for (ω/ωα)2 in terms of m/2ρ∞bS. Substituting this result into the
real part of (6.4) one obtains a quadratic equation in m/2ρ∞b2 which may be solved
in the usual manner. Of course, only real positive values of m/2ρ∞bS are meaning-
ful and if negative or complex values are obtained these are rejected. By choosing
various values of the parameters one may determine under what physically meaning-
ful conditions ﬂutter (neutrally stable oscillations) may occur. This procedure is not
easily extendable to more than two degrees of freedom and it is more readily applied
for determining parameter trends than the ﬂutter boundary of a speciﬁc structure.
Hence, a different method which is described below is frequently used.
This method has the advantage of computational efﬁciency, though from a phys-
ical point of view it is somewhat artiﬁcial. Structural damping is introduced as an
additional parameter by multiplying ω2
α and ω2
h by 1 + ig where g is the structural
damping coefﬁcient. The following parameters are selected ωh/ωα, rα, xα, M, (a real

One may then plot g versus U∞/bωα.30 A typical result is shown in Fig.20 for two
roots (two degrees of freedom). g is the value of structural damping required for
neutral stability. If the actual structural damping is gAV AI L ABLE then ﬂutter occurs
when (see Fig.20)
g = gAV AI L ABLE
It is normally assumed in this method that for g < gAV AI L ABLE and U < UF no
ﬂutter will occur. Sometimes more complicated velocity-damping or V −g curves
are obtained, however. See Fig.21. Given the uncertainty as to what gAV AI L ABLE
may be for a real physical system, it may then be prudent to deﬁne the ﬂutter speed
as the minimum value of U∞/bωα for any g > 0. Here the physical interpretation
of the result becomes more difﬁcult, particularly when one recalls that the factor
1 + ig is only an approximate representation of damping in a structure. Despite this

qualiﬁcation, the V −g method remains a very popular approach to ﬂutter analysis
and is usually only abandoned or improved upon when the physical interpretation of
the result becomes questionable.
One alternative to the V −g method is the so-called p −k method.31 In this
approach time dependence of the form h, α ∼ept is assumed where p = σ + iω. In
theaerodynamictermsonly ak ≡ωb/U isassumed.Theeigenvalues p arecomputed
and the new ω used to compute a new k and the aerodynamic terms re-evaluated.
The iteration continues until the process converges. For small σ, i.e., |σ| ≪|ω|, the
σ so computed may be interpreted as true damping of the system (Fig.22).
Nonlinear Flutter Behavior
There are two other types of ﬂutter which are of importance, ‘transonic buzz’ and
‘stall ﬂutter’. Both of these involve signiﬁcant aerodynamic nonlinearities and are,
therefore, not describable by our previous models. Indeed, both are poorly understood
theoretically compared to classic ﬂutter and recourse to experiment and/or empirical
rules-of-thumb is often made. Recent advances in numerical solution of the nonlin-
ear equations of ﬂuid mechanics (computational ﬂuid dynamics) have provided an
improved methodology for modeling these types of ﬂutter. See chapters ‘Modeling
of Fluid-Structure Interaction’ and ‘Nonlinear Aeroelasticity’.
Typically an oscillating control surface gives rise to an oscillating shock which
produces an oscillating pressure ﬁeld which gives rise to an oscillating control surface
which gives rise to an oscillating shock and so on and so forth (Fig.23).

The airfoil proﬁle shape is known to be an important parameter and this fact
plus the demonstrated importance of the shock means that any aerodynamic theory
which hopes to successfully predict this type of ﬂutter must accurately account for
the nonuniform mean steady ﬂow over the airfoil and its effect on the small dynamic
motions which are superimposed due to control surface and shock oscillation. An
early and insightful theoretical model is that of Eckhaus; also see the discussion
by Landahl. Lambourne has given a valuable summary of the early experimental
and theoretical evidence.32 See chapters ‘Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction’
and ‘Nonlinear Aeroelasticity’ for the most recent literature on this topic. An airfoil
oscillating through large angles of attack will create a time lag in the aerodynamic
moment which may give rise to negative aerodynamic damping in pitch and, hence,
ﬂutter, even though for small angles of attack the aerodynamic damping would be
positive. This is associated with separation of the ﬂow, an effect of ﬂuid viscosity
Compressor,turbineandhelicopterblades areparticularlypronetothistypeofﬂutter,
since they routinely operate through large ranges of angle of attack. Chapter ‘Stall
Flutter’ discusses this type of ﬂutter in some detail. Also see chapters ‘Modeling of
Fluid-Structure Interaction’ and ‘Nonlinear Aeroelasticity’.
Parameter Trends for Flutter
Coalescence ﬂutter is perhaps most common for airfoils under conventional ﬂow
conditions (no shock oscillation and no stall). It is certainly the best understood.
Hence, for this type of ﬂutter, let us consider the the variation of (nondimensional)
ﬂutter velocity with other important parameters.
Static Unbalance. xα:
If xα < 0 (i.e., c.g. is ahead of e.a.) frequently no ﬂutter occurs. If xα < 0 the surface
is said to be ‘mass balanced’.
Frequency Ratio. ωh
ωα :
Not unexpectedly, for coalescence ﬂutter UF/bωα is a minimum when ωh/ωα ≃1.
That is, if ωh and ωα are closer in value, then the aeroelastic frequencies will coalesce
more readily and at a lower ﬂow velocity (Fig.24).

Mach Number. M:
The aerodynamic pressure on an airfoil is normally greatest near Mach number equal
to one33 and hence, the ﬂutter speed (or dynamic pressure) tends to be a minimum
there. For M ≫1 the aerodynamic piston theory predicts that the aerodynamic pres-
sure, p, varies as
p ∼ρU 2

Hence, UF ∼M

Compatibility Conditions:
Note that for ﬂight at constant altitude of a speciﬁc aircraft ρ (hence, μ) and a∞
(speed of sound) are ﬁxed. Since
U = Ma∞
U/bωα and M are not independent, but are related by

Thus, a compatibility relation must also be satisﬁed for physically meaningful in a
ﬂight ﬂutter conditions as indicated by dashed line in Fig.25. By repeating the ﬂutter
calculation for various altitudes (various ρ, a∞and hence various μ and a∞/bωα),
one may obtain a plot of ﬂutter Mach number versus altitude as given in Fig.26.

There is a counterpart to this compatibility condition for testing of aeroelastic
models in a compressible wind tunnel.
Mass ratio. μ:
For large μ the results are essentially those of a constant ﬂutter dynamic pressure;
for small μ they are often those of constant ﬂutter velocity as indicated by the dashed
line in Fig.27. However, for M ≡0 and two-dimensional airfoils theory predicts
UF →∞for some small but ﬁnite μ (solid line). This is contradicted by the experi-
mental evidence and remains a source of some controversy in the literature.34 Crisp35
has suggested that the rigid airfoil chord assumption is untenable for small μ and that
by including elastic chordwise bending the discrepancy between theory and experi-
ment may be resolved. See Fig.27.
Flutter Prevention
After one has ascertained that there is a ﬂutter problem then there is more than a
casual curiosity as to how to ﬁx it, i.e., increase UF, without adding any weight, of
course. There is no universal solution, but frequently one or more of the following
are tried.

as a temporary expedient while one of the above items is studied)
More Complex Structural Models
The above discussion was in the context of the typical section. For more complex
aerospace vehicles, additional degrees of freedom, equations of motion and param-
eters will appear. Basically, these will have the form of additional frequency ratios
(stiffness distribution) and inertial constants (mass distribution). Hence, for example,
we might have ωh

for gust response.36 Since wG is a time history (deterministic or random) we actually
add a functional as a parameter rather than a constant. Hence, various gust responses
will be obtained depending on the nature of the assumed gust time history.
The several approaches to gust response analysis can be categorized by the type
of atmospheric turbulence model adopted. The simplest of these is the sharp edged
gust; a somewhat more elaborate model is the 1-COSINE gust. Both of these are
deterministic; a third gust model is now increasingly used where the gust velocity
ﬁeld is treated as a random process.
Discrete Deterministic Gust:
An example of a useful gust time history is a sharp edged gust,

t′ = t
In this model wG is constant with respect to space and time in the atmospheric ﬁxed
coordinate system for all x′ < 0. We shall deal with the aerodynamic consequences
of this property in the next chapter (Fig.28).
A somewhat more realistic gust model allows for the spatial scale of the gust
ﬁeld. In this model wG is independent of time, t′, but varies with distance, x′, in
the atmospheric ﬁxed coordinate system, x′, t′. For obvious reasons it is called a
1-COSINE gust i.e.,

Random Gust:
In a random gust ﬁeld, we still adopt the assumption that wG, though now a random
variable, varies only with x′ and is independent of t′. In the theory of isotropic
turbulence this is usually referred to as Taylor’s hypothesis37 or the ‘frozen gust’
assumption. Thus
wG(x′) = wG(x −U∞t)

We conclude this discussion with a representative vehicle responses to random
gust ﬁelds drawn from a variety of sources.39 The analytical results are from mathe-
matical models similar to those described above, but with more elaborate structural
and aerodynamic ingredients as described in succeeding pages in this chapter and
chapter ‘Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’.
37 Houbolt, Steiner and Pratt [6]. The basis for the frozen gust assumption is that in the time interval
for any part of the gust ﬁeld to pass over the ﬂight vehicle (the length/U∞)the gust ﬁeld does
not signiﬁcantly change its (random) spatial distribution. Clearly this becomes inaccurate as U∞
becomes small.

In the Fig.32, the measured and calculated power spectral densities for acceler-
ation at the pilot station of the XB-70 aircraft are shown. The theoretical structural
model allows for rigid body and elastic degrees of freedom using methods such
as those described later in this chapter. The aerodynamic theory is similar to those
described in chapter ‘Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’.
The dramatic conclusion drawn from his ﬁgure is that theory and experiment do not
necessarily agree closely! If one assumes the peaks in the measured and calculated
spectra are associated with resonances at natural frequencies of the (aeroelastic) sys-
tem, then one concludes the theoretical model is not predicting these adequately.
Since the resonances are determined primarily by mass and stiffness (springs), one
concludes that for real vehicles even these characteristics may be difﬁcult to model
mathematically. This is quite aside from other complications such as structural damp-
ing and aerodynamic forces.

¯y = nondimensional distance along span. From Houbolt [6]
Usually when one is dealing with a real vehicle, physical small scale models are
built and with these (as well as the actual vehicle when it is available) the resonant
frequencies are measured (in the absence of any airﬂow). The results are then used
to ‘correct’ the mathematical model, by one method or another, including a possible
direct replacement of calculated resonant frequencies by their measured counterparts
in the equations of motion. When this is done the peak frequencies in the measured
and calculated spectra will then agree (necessarily so) and the question then becomes
one of how well the peak levels agree.
Acomparisonforanotheraircraft,theB-47,isshowninFig.33.Herethemeasured
and calculated resonant frequencies are in good agreement. Moreover the peak levels
and indeed all levels are in good correspondence. The particular comparison shown
is for the system transfer function which relates the acceleration at a point on the
aircraft to the random gust input. The calculated transfer function has been obtained
from an aeroelastic mathematical model. The measured transfer function (from ﬂight
test) is inferred from a measurement of gust power spectra and cross-spectra between
the vehicle acceleration and gust velocity ﬁeld using the relation (c.f. e.g. (3.31))
H¨hwG =
¨hwG

Both the amplitude and phase of the transfer function are shown as a function of
frequency for various positions along the wing span ( ¯y = 0 is at the wing root and ¯y =
1 at the wing tip). Such good agreement between theory and experiment is certainly
encouraging. However, clearly there is a major combined theoretical-experimental
effort required to determine accurately the response of structures to gust loading. It
should be noted that according to [6], Fig.33 is the bending strain transfer function.
‘The dimensions of the ordinates . . . are those for acceleration because the responses
of the strain gages were calibrated in terms of the strain per unit normal acceleration
experienced during a shallow pull-up maneuver.’

Generalized Equations of Motion for Complex Structures
7.1
Lagrange’s Equations and Modal Methods
(Rayleigh–Ritz)
The most effective method for deriving equations of motion for many complex
dynamical systems is to use Lagrange’s Equations.40
d
dt
∂L
∂˙qi
−∂L
∂qi
= Qi
where
L ≡T-U, Lagrangian
T ≡kinetic energy
U ≡potential energy
Qi ≡generalized forces
qi ≡generalized coordinates
The essential steps in the method are, ﬁrst, a suitable choice of qi and then an
evaluation of T,U and Qi in terms of Qi and ˙qi.
Lagrange’s equations have, as one of their principal advantages, the ability to
obtain the equations of motion for complex systems with little or no more difﬁculty
than that required for rather simple ones, such as the ‘typical section’. Here we shall
consider a two-dimensional (planar) representation on a ﬂight vehicle. (See Fig.34).
We note that this formulation can include ‘rigid’ body as well as ﬂexible body
modes. For example, the following choices of modal functions, zm, include rigid
body vertical translation, pitching (rotation about y axis) and rolling (rotation about
x axis), respectively.
40 Recall Sect.2.

122
E. H. Dowell
Fig. 34 Two-dimensional (planar) representation of a ﬂight vehicle
z1 = 1 vertical translation
z2 = x pitching
z3 = y rolling
For such modes the potential elastic or strain energy is zero; however, in general,
strain energy must be included for the ﬂexible body modes.
The use of Lagrange’s equations, while formally compact, does not reveal explic-
itly all of the complications which may arise in deriving equations of motion for an
unrestrained vehicle or structure. These are seen more clearly in the discussion in a
later section of integral equations of equilibrium.

Kinetic Energy
The x −y plane is the plane of the (aircraft) structure. We consider deformations
perpendicular to the x −y plane (in the z direction). The normal displacement with

the kinetic energy as

Equations (7.3)–(7.6) are the keys to the Lagrangian approach. Before continuing,
we pause to consider Kmn in more detail.
Alternative Determination of Kmn
A stiffness inﬂuence function, K(x, y, ξ, η), may be deﬁned which is the (static)
force/area required at point x, y to give a unit deﬂection at point ξ, η. Hence
p(x, y) =

K(x, y; ξ, η)za(ξ, η)dξ dη

A simple spring analog of (7.7) is

(7.10)
From Maxwell’s Reciprocity Theorem
K(x, y; ξ, η) = K(ξ, η; x, y)
and hence
Kmn = Knm
(7.11)
K(x, y; ξ, η) can be determined by a suitable theoretical analysis or it can be inferred
from experiment. For the additional insight to be gained, let us consider the latter
alternative. It is a difﬁcult experiment to measure K directly since we must determine
a distribution of force/area which gives unit deﬂection at one point and zero deﬂection
elsewhere.Insteaditismucheasiertomeasuretheinverseof K,aﬂexibilityinﬂuence,
C(x, y; ξ, η) which is the deﬂection at x, y due to a unit force/area at ξ, η. For
C(x, y; ξ, η) we have the following relation (recall Sect.4)
za(x, y) =

C(x, y; ξ, η)p(ξ, η)dξ dη
(7.12)
Using (7.7) and (7.12) it can be shown that

C(x, y; ξ, η)K(ξ, η;r, s)dξ dη = δ(r −x, s −y)
(7.13)
where δ is a Dirac delta function. Equation (7.13) is an integral equation for C or K
given the other. However, it is rarely, if ever, used. Instead (7.6) and (7.1) are attacked
directly by considering a ﬁnite number of loads and deﬂections over small (ﬁnite)
areas of size xy = ξη. Hence (7.7) and (7.12) are written
p(xi, yi) =
	
i
K(xi, yi; ξ j, η j)za(ξ j, η j)ξη
(7.7)
za(x j, y j) =

(7.11)
In matrix notation
{p} = [K]{za}ξη
(7.7)
{za} = [C]{p}ξη
(7.11)
Substitution of (7.12) into (7.7) and solving, gives

126
E. H. Dowell
[K] = [C]−1/(ξ)2(η)2
(7.14)
Equation (7.14) is essentially a ﬁnite difference solution to (7.13). Hence, in practice,
if (7.10) is used to compute Kmn, one measures C, computes K from (7.14) and then
evaluates Kmn by numerical integration of (7.10). For a fuller discussion of inﬂuence
functions, the reader may wish to consult Bisplinghoff, Mar and Pian [2].
There is one further subtlety which we have not discussed as yet. If rigid body
motions of the structure are possible, then one may wish to use a C measure with
respecttoaﬁxedpoint.ForexampleitmaybeconvenienttomeasureC withthecenter
of the mass ﬁxed with respect to translation and rotation. This matter is discussed
for fully later in the chapter when integral equations of equilibrium are reviewed.
We now continue the general discussion from which we digressed to consider
Kmn. Two examples will be considered next.

To illustrate the key relations (7.3)–(7.6) in a more familiar situation, consider the

a beam-rod.

If this is not so then the eigenvalues may be determined from (7.22) and a linear

exercise.
For our purposes, the key point is that expression like (7.3)–(7.6) exist. For a more
extensive discussion of these matters, the reader may consult Meirovitch [4].

Integral Equations of Equilibrium
As an alternative approach to Lagrange’s Equations, we consider an integral equation
formulation using the concept of a structure inﬂuence (Green’s) function. We shall
treat a ﬂat (two-dimensional) structure which deforms under (aerodynamic) loading

Dynamic Aeroelasticity
133
in an arbitrary way. We shall assume a symmetrical vehicle and take the origin of our
coordinate system at the vehicle center of mass with the two axes in the plane of the
vehicle as principal axes, x, y. See Fig.34. Note the motion is assumed sufﬁciently
small so that no distinction is made between the deformed and undeformed axes of
the body. For example the inertia and elastic integral properties are evaluated using
the (undeformed) axes x, y. The axes x, y are inertial axes, i.e., ﬁxed in space. If we
consider small deﬂections normal to the x, y plane, the x, y axes are approximately
the principal axes of the deformed vehicle.
It will be useful to make several deﬁnitions.

pE
external applied force/area, e.g., aerodynamic forces due to gust, pG

Since the method of obtaining the subsequent equations of motion involves some
rather extensive algebra, we outline the method here.
1 Set pE = pM = 0.
2 Obtain ‘natural frequencies and modes’; prove orthogonality of modes.
3 Expand deformation, za for nonzero pE and pM in terms of normal modes or
natural modes and obtain a set of equation for the (time dependent) coefﬁcients
of the expansion. The ﬁnal result will again be (7.30).
7.8
Natural Frequencies and Modes
Set pE = pM = 0. Assume sinusoidal motion, i.e.,
za(x, y, t) = ¯za(x, y)eiωt
(7.39)
then (7.38) becomes

C(x, y; ξ, η)m(ξ, η)¯za(ξ, η)dξ dη

form of a standard eigenvalue problem by solving for za(0, 0), ∂¯za
∂x (0, 0), ∂¯za
∂y (0, 0)
and substituting into (7.40). For example, consider the determination of za(0, 0).

45 By ﬁxed we mean ‘clamped’ in the sense of the structural engineer, i.e., zero displacement and
slope. It is sufﬁcient to use a static inﬂuence function, since invoking by D’Alambert’s Principle

If G were symmetric, i.e.,
G(ξ, η; x, y) = G(x, y; ξ, η)

from (7.44), et. seq., one can write

(7.53)
Using the above to substitute for G(ξ, η; x, y) in (7.50) and using (7.35)–(7.37) to
simplify the result, one sees that the terms on the right-hand side of (7.53) contribute
nothing. Hence, the right-hand sides of (7.49d) and (7.49c) are indeed equal.
The orthogonality result follows. Note that the rigid body modes
ω1 = 0
φ1 = 1
ω2 = 0
φ2 = x
ω3 = 0
φ3 = y
(7.54)
are orthogonal as well. One can verify readily that the above satisfy the equations
of motion, (7.35)–(7.38), and that the orthogonality conditions follow from (7.35)–
(7.37).

Now the structural inﬂuence function, C, is symmetric, i.e.,

Note that there is no inertial or structural coupling in the Eq.(7.67), However pM
generally depends upon q1, q2, . . . and hence the equations are aerodynamically
coupled.47 The lack of inertial and structural coupling is due to our use of natural or
normal modes. Finally, note that the rigid body equation of motions, (7.56)–(7.58),
also have the form of (7.67). Hence n may run over all integer values.

φ(s) = 1 −0.165e−0.0455s −0.335e−0.3s

Note that bracketed term in (7.82) must be a real quantity though the components
thereof may be complex (conjugates). Also, what does it mean physically if the real
part of γ1, γ2 or γ3 is positive?
An even simpler theory of gust response is available if one further approximates
the aerodynamic forces. Foe example, using a quasi-static aerodynamic theory (recall
Section 3.4), one has
ψ = 1 and thus LG = 2πρU 2

φ = 0, and thus L M = 0 (ignoring virtual inertia term)

The subscripted quantity, ¨q1, is called the static approximation to the gust response.
Figure35 is a schematic of the result from the full theory, (7.82), referenced to the
static result, (7.83). Here we have further assumed a sharp-edge gust, i.e., wG=
constant. After Fig. 22 BAH. The maxima of the above curves are presented in
Fig.36. As can be seen the static approximation is a good approximation for large
mass ratio, μ. For smaller μ the acceleration is less than the static result. Hence the
quantity, ¨q1max
¨q1s
is sometimes referred to as a ‘gust alleviation’ factor.
A somewhat more sophisticated aerodynamic approximation is to let (again recall
Sect.4)
ψ = 1 and thus LG = 2πρU 2bwG

φ = 1 and thus L M = −πρU 2[q′′(s) + 2q′(s)]

assuming q′(0) = 0. In the motion induced lift, the L Mﬁrst term is a virtual inertial
term which is generally negligible compared to the inertia of the ﬂight vehicle.
However, the second term is an aerodynamic damping term which provides the
only damping in the system and hence may be important. It is this aerodynamic
damping, even in the guise of the full (linear)aerodynamic theory, which gives results
substantially different from the static approximation. Equation (7.84) is termed a
quasi-steady aerodynamic approximation.

Equation (7.95) is a set of integral-differential equations in one variable, time. They
are mathematically similar to the typical section equations. If we further restrict
ourselves to consideration of translation plus the ﬁrst wing bending mode, we have
two equations in two unknowns. These may be solved as in Examples (a) by Laplace
Transformation. Alternatively, Examples (a) and (b) could be handled by numerical
integration in the time domain. Yet another option is to work the problem in the
frequency domain.
(c) Random Gusts Solution in the Frequency Domain
Pursuing the latter option, we only need replace the Laplace transform variable, p,
by iw where w is the Fourier frequency. For simplicity, consider again Example (a).

is a transfer function relating sinusoidal rigid body response to sinusoidal gust veloc-
ity. The poles of the transfer function can be examined for stability. The mean square

Equation (8.6) is a transcendental equation for ω which has no known analytical
solution. Numerical solution are obtained as follows. For a given pipe at a given U
one makes a guess for ω (in general a complex number with real and imaginary parts.)
The p1, . . . , p4 are then evaluated from (8.4). D is evaluated from (8.6); in general
it is not zero and one must improve upon the original guess for ω (iterate) until D is
zero. A new U is selected and the process repeated. For U = 0, the ω will be purely
real and correspond to the natural frequencies of the pipe including the virtual mass
of the ﬂuid. Hence, it is convenient to ﬁrst set U = 0 and then systematically increase
it. A sketch of ω versus U is shown below in nondimensional form. These results
are taken from a paper by Paidoussis who has worked extensively on this problem.
When the imaginary part of ωI becomes negative, ﬂutter occurs. The nondimensional
variables used in presenting these results are (we have changed the notation from
Paidoussis with respect to frequency)

The stability boundary for this system may be presented in terms of u and β as
given in Fig.41. Also shown is the frequency, F, of the ﬂutter oscillation. These
results have been veriﬁed experimentally by Gregory and Paidoussis.52 For a very
readable historical and technical review of this problem, see the paper by Paidoussis

(High Speed) Fluid Flow Over a Flexible Wall—A Simple
Prototype for Plate or Panel Flutter
One type of ﬂutter which becomes of considerable technological interest with the
advent of supersonic ﬂight is called ‘panel ﬂutter’. Here the concern is with a thin
elastic plate or panel supported at its edge. For simplicity consider two dimensional
motion. The physical situation is sketched below.
Over the top of the elastic plate, which is mounted ﬂush in an otherwise rigid wall,
there is an airﬂow. The elastic bending of the plate in the direction of the airﬂow
(streamwise) is the essential difference between this type of ﬂutter and classical ﬂutter
of an airfoil as exempliﬁed by the typical section. It is not our purpose to probe deeply
into this problem here; for a thorough treatment the reader is referred to Dowell.55 We

shall instead be content to consider a highly simpliﬁed model (somewhat analogous
to the typical section model for airfoil ﬂutter)which will bring out some of the
important features of this type of problem. Thus we consider the alternative physical
model shown in Fig.42.56 Here our model consists of three rigid plates each hinged
at both ends. The hinges between the ﬁrst and second plates and also the second
and third plates are supported by springs. The plates have mass per unit length, m,
and are of length, l. At high supersonic Mach number, M >> 1, the aerodynamic
pressure change (perturbation) p, due to plate motion is modelled by (see chapter
‘Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’) a quasi-steady or
quasi-static form
p = ρ∞U 2
∞

∂w
∂x
(8.7)
where w(x, t) ∂w
∂x are deﬂection and slope of any one of the rigid plates (Fig.43).
To write the equations of motion for this physical model we must recognize
that there are two degrees of freedom. It is convenient to choose as generalized
coordinates, q1, q2, the vertical deﬂections of the springs.
The potential energy of the model is then
U = 1
2kq2

The kinetic energy requires expression for w in terms of q1 and q2 since the mass is
distributed. For each plate we have, in turn,

∂x = q1/l

(1) The ﬂutter mechanism is a convergence of natural frequencies with increasing
ﬂow velocity. The ﬂutter frequency is between the ﬁrst and second natural frequen-
cies. In this respect it is similar to classical bending-torsion ﬂutter of an airfoil.
(2) The ﬂutter mode shape shows a maximum nearer the rear edge of the plate
(rather than the front edge) (Fig.44).
There are, of course, some oversimpliﬁcations in the rigid plate model. For exam-
ple, the plate length does not affect the ﬂow velocity at which ﬂutter occurs. For an
elastic plate, it would. Also in subsonic ﬂow the curvature of the plate has a strong
inﬂuence on the aerodynamic pressure. In the rigid plate model, the curvature is iden-
tically zero, of course. Nevertheless the model serves a useful purpose in introducing
this type of ﬂutter problem. For a review of the recent literature on panel ﬂutter, see
Mei et al. [34].

Subsonic and transonic mach number ranges is presented including representative
computational methods and results. The discussion with the simplest case of super-
sonic ﬂow in two dimensions and then proceeds to consider the generalization to
three dimensional ﬂow, then subsonic ﬂow and ﬁnally transonic ﬂow. The discussion
proceedsfromthesimplesttothemostcomplexcaseanddoesnotfollowthehistorical
order in which these subjects were treated. Also fourier and laplace transforms are
used to obtain the key results even though other methods were used historically to

Basic Fluid Dynamic Equations
Nonsteady aerodynamics is the study of time dependent ﬂuid motion generated by
(solid) bodies moving in a ﬂuid. Normally (and as distinct from classical acuostics)
the body motion is composed of a (large) steady motion, plus a (small) time depen-
dent motion. In classical acoustics no (large) steady motions are examined. On the
other hand, it should be said, in most of classical aerodynamic theory small time
dependent motions are ignored, i.e. only small steady perturbations from the origi-
nal steady motion are usually examined. However in a number of problems arising
in aeroelasticity, such as a ﬂutter and gust analysis, and also in ﬂuid generated noise,
such as turbulent boundary layers and jet wakes, the more general case must be
attacked. It shall be our concern here.1 The basic assumptions about the nature of the
ﬂuid are that it be inviscid and its thermodynamic processes be isentropic. We shall
ﬁrst direct our attention to a derivation of the Equations of motion, using the appa-
ratus of vector calculus and, of course, allowing for a large mean ﬂow velocity Let
us recall some purely mathematical relationships developed in the vector calculus.
These are all variations of what is usually termed Gauss’ theorem.2

Irrotational Flow, Kelvin’s Theorem and Bernoulli’s

To solve these nonlinear, partial differential equations we must integrate them. Gen-
erally, this is an impossible task except by numerical procedures. However, there is
one integration that may be preformed which is both interesting theoretically and
useful for application.

and if we assume the ﬂow is irrotational,
⃗q = ∇φ
(1.12)
where φ is the scalar velocity potential. Equation(1.12) implies and is implied by
∇× ⃗q = 0
(1.13)
The vanishing of the curl of velocity is a consequence of Kelvin’s Theorem which
states that a ﬂow which is initially irrotational, ∇× ⃗q = 0, remains so at all sub-
sequent time in the absent of dissipation, e.g., viscosity or shock waves. It can be
proven using (1.3), (1.8) and (1.9). No additional assumptions are needed.
Let us pause to prove this result. We shall begin with the momentum equation.

Small Perturbation Theory
Equations(1.21) and (1.22) are often too difﬁcult to solve. Hence a simpler approx-
imate theory is sought.

168
E. H. Dowell
As in acoustics we shall linearize about a uniform equilibrium state. Assume
a = a∞+ ˆa
p = p∞+ ˆp
ρ = ρ∞+ ˆρ
⃗q = U∞⃗i + ˆ⃗q
φ = U∞x + ˆφ
∇φ = U∞⃗i + ∇ˆφ
(1.23)
Note in the present case we linearize about a uniform ﬂow with velocity, U∞. Using
(1.23) in (1.21) and retraining lowest order terms:
First term:
∇2φ →∇2 ˆφ
Second term:
∂
∂t (∇φ · ∇φ) + ∂2φ
∂t2 + ∇φ · ∇(∇φ · ∇φ

ﬂuid, we may formally reduce the problem to that of classical acoustics.

ˆφ = f (αx′ + βy′ + ϵz′ + a∞t′) + g(αx′ + βy′ + ϵz′ −a∞t′)
where
α2 + β2 + ϵ2 = 1

E. H. Dowell
Unfortunately the above solution is not very useful, nor is the primed coordinate
system, as it is difﬁcult to satisfy the boundary conditions on the moving body in a
coordinate system at rest with respect to the air (and hence moving with respect to
the body). That is, obtaining solutions of (1.24) or (1.27) is not especially difﬁcult
per se. It is obtaining solutions subject to the boundary conditions of interest which
is challenging.
1.5.2
Boundary Conditions
We shall need to consider boundary conditions of various types and also certain
continuity conditions as well. In general we shall see that, at least in the small
perturbation theory, it is the boundary conditions, rather than the equation of motions
per se, which offer the principal difﬁculty.
The BODY BOUNDARY CONDITION states the normal velocity of the ﬂuid at
the body surface equals the normal velocity of the body.
Consider a body whose surface is described by F(x, y, z, t) = 0 at some time,
t, and at some later time, t + t, by F(x + x, y + y, z + z, t + t) = 0. See
Fig.1
Now
F ≡F(⃗r + ⃗r, t + t) −F(⃗r, t) = 0
and also
F = ∂F
∂x x + ∂F
∂y y + ∂F

Thus
∇F · ⃗r + ∂F
∂t t = 0

1.5.3
Symmetry and Anti-symmetry
One of the several advantages of linearization is the ability to divide the aerodynamic
problem into two distinct cases, symmetrical (thickness) and anti-symmetrical (lift-
ing) ﬂow. If one denotes the upper surface by
fupper = zu(x, y, t)
and the lower surface by
flower = zl(x, y, t)
then it is useful to write
zu ≡zt + zL
(1.36)
zl ≡−zt + zL
where (1.36) deﬁnes zt, thickness, and zL, lifting contributions to zu and zl.
One may retreat the thickness and lifting cases separately (due to linearity) and
superimpose their results for any zu and zl. The thickness case is much simpler than
the lifting case as we shall see.
Recall (1.35), (we henceforward drop the ∧on φ, p)

where + denotes the upper surface and—denotes the lower. From (1.35) and (1.36),
one sees that
Thickness case
∂φ
∂z is anti-symmetric with respect to z (discontinuous across airfoil)
hence φ is symmetric (and also p).
Lifting case

hence φ is anti-symmetric (and also p).

Thus p = 0 for the thickness case, i.e., there is no lift on the airfoil.

imposed at inﬁnity, z →±∞.

Supersonic Flow
It is convenient to distinguish between various ﬂow regimes on the basis of geometry
(two or three dimensions) and Mach number (subsonic or supersonic). We shall not
give a historical development, but shall instead begin with the simplest regime and
proceed to the more difﬁcult problems. Our main focus will be the determination of
pressure distributions on airfoils and wings.
2.1
Two-Dimensional Flow
This ﬂow regime5 is the simplest as the ﬂuid ahead of the body remains undisturbed
and that behind the body does not inﬂuence the pressure distribution on the body.
These results follow from the mathematics, but they also can be seen from reasonably
simple physical considerations. Take a body moving with velocity, U∞, through a
ﬂuid whose undisturbed speed of sound is a∞, where M ≡U∞/a∞> 1. At any
point in the ﬂuid disturbed by the passage of the body, disturbances will propagate
to the right with velocity, +a∞, and to the left, −a∞with respect to the ﬂuid. That is,
as viewed in the prime coordinate system. The corresponding propagation velocities
as seen with respect to the body or airfoil will be:
U∞−a∞
and
U∞+ a∞
Notethesearebothpositive,hencetheﬂuidaheadoftheairfoilisneverdisturbed;also
disturbance behind the airfoil never reach the body. For subsonic ﬂow, M < 1, the
situation is more complicated. Even for three-dimensional, supersonic ﬂow one must
consider possible effects of disturbances off the side edges in the third dimension.
Hence the two-dimensional, supersonic problems offers considerable simpliﬁcation.
One of the consequences of the simplicity, as we will see, is that no distinc-
tion between thickness and lifting cases need be made as far as the mathematics is
concerned. Hence the body boundary conditions is (considering z > 0)

Because of the complicated mathematical form of our solution, it is difﬁcult to
understand its physical signiﬁcance. Perhaps it is most helpful for this purpose to
consider the limits of low and high frequency.

The latter result may be written as
p = ρ∞a∞wa
which is the pressure on a piston in a long, narrow (one-dimensional) tube with ω
the velocity of the piston. It is, therefore, termed ‘piston theory’ for obvious reasons.
Note that in the limits of low and high frequency the pressure at point x depends
only upon the downwash at the same point. For arbitrary ω, the pressure a one point
depends in general upon the downwash at all other points. See (2.15). Hence the
ﬂow has a simpler behavior in the limits of small and large ω than for intermediate
ω. Also recall that low and high frequency may be interpreted in the time domain
for transient motion as long and short time respectively. This follows from the initial
and ﬁnal value Laplace Transform theorems.7 For example, if we consider a motion
which corresponds to a step change in angle of attack, α, we have
f = −xα
for
t > 0
= 0
for
t < 0
wa = −α
for
t > 0
wa/U∞= 0
for
t < 0

The result for short time may also be deduced by applying a Laplace Transform with
respect to time and taking the limit t →0 of the formal inversion.
2.4.1
General Comments
A few general comments should be made about the solution. First of all, the solution
has been obtained for simple harmonic motion. In principle, the solution for arbitrary
time dependent motion may be obtained via Fourier superposition of the simple
harmonic motion result. Actually it is more efﬁcient to use a Laplace Transform with
respect to time and invert the time variable prior to inverting the spatial variable, x.
Secondly, with regard to the distinction between the lifting and thickness cases, one
can easily show by direct calculation and using the method applied previously that
thickness z = 0+
w = wa
p = p+
z = 0−
w = −wa
p = p+
lifting z = 0+
w = wa
p = p+
z = 0−
w = wa
p = −p+
where p+ is the solution previously obtained. Of course these results also follow
from our earlier general discussion of boundary conditions.
2.5
Gusts
Finally it is of interest to consider how aerodynamic pressures develop on a body
moving through a nonuniform ﬂow, i.e., a ‘gust’. If the body is motionless, the body
boundary condition is that the total ﬂuid velocity be zero on the body.
∂φ
∂z

z=0 + wG = 0

182
E. H. Dowell
where wG is the speciﬁed vertical ‘gust’ velocity and ∂φ/∂z is the perturbation
ﬂuid velocity resulting from the body passing through the gust ﬁeld. Hence in our
previous development we may replace w by—wGand the same analysis then applies.
Frequently one assumes that the gust ﬁeld is ‘frozen’, i.e., ﬁxed with respect to the
ﬂuid ﬁxed coordinates, x′, y′, z′, t′. Hence
wG = wG(x′, y′)
= wG(x −U∞t, y)
Further a special case is a ‘sharp edge’ gust for which one simply has
wG = w0
for
x′ < 0
= 0
for
x′ > 0
or
wG = w0
for
t > x/U∞
= 0
for
t < x/U∞
These special assumptions are frequently used in applications.
Solutions for the sharp edge gust can be obtained through superposition of (sim-
ple harmonic motion) sinusoidal gusts. However, it is more efﬁcient to use methods
developed for transient motion. Hence before turning to three-dimensional super-
sonic ﬂow, we consider transient motion. Transient solutions can be obtained directly
(in contrast to Fourier superposition of simple harmonic motion results) for a two-
dimensional, supersonic ﬂow.
2.6
Transient Motion
Taking a Laplace transform with respect to time and a Fourier transform with respect
to the streamwise coordinate, x, the analog of (2.11) is
LF{φ}at z=0 = −LFwa
μ
(2.22)
iω ≡s is the Laplace Transform variable (where ω was the frequency in the simple
harmonic motion result), α is the Fourier transform variable (where iα ≡p was the
Laplace transform variable used in the previous simple harmonic motion result), L ≡
Laplace transform, F ≡Fourier transform, and

Lift, Due to Atmospheric Gust
wG(x −U∞t) = wG(x′)
x, t are coordinates ﬁxed with respect to airfoil and x′, t′ are coordinates ﬁxed with
respect to atmosphere. At t = t′ = 0 the airfoil enters the gust; the boundary con-
dition is wa + wG = 0 or wa = −wG on airfoil. See Fig.3. Short and long time
correspond to high and low frequency; hence it is of interest to use our previously
developed approximate theories for these limits. Subsequently we treat the full tran-
sient case.

For an alternative approach to transient motion which makes use of an anal-
ogy between two-dimensional time dependent motion and three-dimensional steady
motion, the reader may consult Lomax [4].
This completes our development for two-dimensional, supersonic ﬂow. We now
have the capability for determining the aerodynamic pressures necessary for ﬂutter,
gust and even, in principle, acoustic analyses for this type of ﬂow. For the latter the
pressure in the ‘far ﬁeld’ (large z) is usually of interest. Now let us consider similar
analyses for three-dimensional, supersonic ﬂow.8
2.9
Three Dimensional Flow
We shall now add the third dimension to our analysis. As we shall see there is no
essential complication with respect to solving the governing differential equation;

If ¯w is known everywhere in the region of integration then (2.39) is a solution to our
problem. Unfortunately, in many cases of interest, ¯wa is unknown over some portion
of the region of interest. Recall that ¯wa is really ∂¯φ
∂z |z=0. In general this vertical ﬂuid
velocity is unknown off the wing. There are three principal exceptions to this:
(1) If we are dealing with a thickness problem then ∂φ
∂z |z=0 = 0 everywhere off the
wing and no further analysis is required.
(2) Certain wing geometries above a certain Mach number will have undisturbed
ﬂow off the wing even in the lifting case. For these so-called ‘supersonic planforms’,
∂φ
∂z |z=0 = 0 off wing as well.
(3) Even in the most general case, there will be no disturbance to the ﬂow ahead
of the rearward facing Mach lines, η = ±ξ/β, which originate at the leading most
point of the lifting surface.
To make case (2) more explicit and in order to discuss what must be done for
those cases where the ﬂow off the wing is disturbed, let us consider the following
ﬁgure; Fig.4. Referring ﬁrst to case (2), we see that if the slopes of the forward
facing Mach lines (integration limits of (2.39)) and the rearward facing Mach lines
η = y ± (x −ξ)
β
and
η = ±ξ/β
are sufﬁciently small, i.e., | 1
β | →0, then the regions where ¯wa is unknown, will
vanish. This is what we mean by a ‘supersonic planform’. The mathematical problem

for these planforms is essentially the same as for a ‘thickness problem’ whether or
not lift is being produced.
Finally let us consider the most difﬁcult case where we have mixed boundary
condition problems. In general analytical solutions are not possible and we resort
to numerical methods. One such is the ‘box’ method. In this approach, the integral

Computer programs have been written to preform the various computations.9 Also
it should be pointed out that in the evaluations of the ‘aerodynamic’ inﬂuence coef-
ﬁcients it is essential to account for the singular nature of the integrand along the
Mach lines. This requires an analytical integration of (2.39) over each box with ¯w
assumed constant and taken outside the integral.
Extensions to this technique have been made to include more complicated geome-
tries, e.g., nonplanar and multiple surfaces,10and also efforts have been made to
include other physical effects.11

Subsonic Flow
Subsonic ﬂow12 is generally a more difﬁcult problem area since all parts of the ﬂow
are disturbed due to the motion of the airfoil. To counter this difﬁculty an inverse
method of solution has been evolved, the so-called ‘Kernel Function’ approach.
To provide continuity with our previous development we shall formulate and solve
the problem in a formal way through the use of Fourier Transforms. Historically,
however, other methods were used. These will be discussed after we have obtained
our formal solution. To avoid repetition, we shall treat the three-dimensional problem
straight away.
Bernoulli’s equation reads:
p = −ρ∞[∂φ
∂t + U∞
∂φ
∂x ]
(3.1)
It will prove convenient to use this relationship to formulate our solution in term of
pressure directly rather than velocity potential.
3.1
Derivation of the Integral Equation by Transform
Methods and Solution by Collocation
As before we will use the transform calculus. Since there is no limited range of
inﬂuence in subsonic ﬂow we employ Fourier transforms with respect to x and y.
We shall also assume, as before, simple harmonic time dependent motion. Thus
φ = ¯φ(x, y, z)eiωt

K is physically interpreted as the (non-dimensional) ‘upwash’, ¯w/U∞at x, y due
to a unit (delta-function) of pressure, ¯p/ρ∞U 2
∞, at ξ, η. For lifting ﬂow (subsonic or
supersonic), ¯p = 0 off the wing; hence in (3.8) the (double) integral can be conﬁned
to the wing area. This is the advantage of the present formulation.
Now we are faced with the problem of extracting the pressure from beneath the
integral in (3.9). By analogy to the supersonic ‘box’ approach we might consider
approximating the integral equation by a double sum

Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces

This solution is mathematically incorrect; worse, it is useless. The reason is that it is
not unique unless an additional restriction is made, the so-called ‘Kutta Condition’.13
Thisrestrictionstatesthatthepressureonthetrailingedgeofathinairfoilmustremain
ﬁnite. For a lifting airfoil this is tantamount to saying it must be zero. This constraint
is empirical in nature being suggested by experiment. Other constraints such as zero
pressure at the leading edge would also make the mathematical solution unique;
however, this would not agree with available experimental date. Indeed these data
suggest a pressure maxima at the edge; the theory with trailing edge Kutta condition
gives a square root singularity at the leading edge.
Although, in principle, one could ensure zero pressure at the trailing edge by using
a constraint equation to supplement (3.9) and/or (3.10), another approach has gained
favor in practice. In this approach the pressure is expanded in a series of (given)
modes
¯p =

k

l
pkl Fk(ξ)Gl(η)
(3.11)
where the functions Fk(ξ) are chosen to satisfy the Kutta condition. (If the wing
platform is other than rectangular, a coordinate transformation may need to be made
in order to choose such functions readily.) The pkl are, as yet, unknown.
Substituting (3.11) into (3.8) and integrating over the wing area

˜Kkl(x, y)

 
K(x −ξ, y −η)Fk(ξ)Gl(η)dξ dη
¯K is singular at x = ξ, y = η (as we shall see later) and the above integral must be
evaluated with some care.
The question remains how to evaluate the unknown coefﬁcient, pkl in terms of
¯w/U∞(x, y)? The most common procedure is collection. Equation(3.12) is evalu-
ated at a number of points xi, y j, equal to the number of coefﬁcients, pkl. Thus (3.12)
becomes

This completes our formal solution. Relative to the supersonic ‘box’ method, the
above procedure, the so-called ‘Kernel Function’ method, has proven to be somewhat
delicate. In particular, questions have arisen as to:
1. the ‘optimum’ selection of pressure modes
2. the ‘best’ method for computing ˜K
3. convergence of the method as the number of pressure modes becomes large
It appear, however, that as experience is acquired these questions are being satisfac-
torily answered at least on an ‘ad hoc’ basis.
In a later development an alternative approach for solving (3.8) has gained pop-
ularity which is known as the ‘double lattice’ method. In this method the lifting
surface is divided into boxes and collocation is used for both the downwash and the
pressure.14
3.2
An Alternative Determination of the Kernel Function
Using Green’s Theorem
The transform methods are most efﬁcient at least for formal derivations, however
historically other approaches were ﬁrst used. Many of these are now only of interest
to history, however we should mention one other approach which is a powerful tool
for non-steady aerodynamic problems. This is the use of Green’s Theorem.
First let us review the nature of Green’s Theorem.15 Our starting point is the
Divergence Theorem or Gauss’ Theorem.
  
∇· ⃗bdV =
 
⃗b · ⃗ndS
(3.15)
S surface area enclosing volume V
⃗n outward normal
⃗b arbitrary vector
Let ⃗b = φ1 ∇φ2 where φ1, φ2 are arbitrary scalars. Then (3.15) may be written as:
  
∇· φ1∇φ2dV =
 
⃗n · φ1∇φ2dS
14Albano and Rodden [11]. The downwash is placed at the box three-quarters chord and pressure
concentrated at the one-quarter chord. For two-dimensional steady ﬂow this provides an exact solu-
tion which satisﬁes the Kutta conditions. Lifanov, T.K. and Polanski, T.E., ‘Proof of the Numerical
Method of “Discrete Vortices” for Solving Singular Integral Equations’, PMM (1975), pp. 742–746.

Now use the vector calculation identity
∇· c⃗a = c∇· ⃗a + ⃗a · ∇c
c arbitrary scalar
⃗a arbitrary vector
then ∇· φ1∇φ2 = φ1∇2φ2 + ∇φ2 · ∇φ1 and (3.15) becomes
  
[φ1∇2φ2 + ∇φ2 · ∇φ1]dV =
 
⃗n · φ1∇φ2dS
(3.16)
This is the ﬁrst form of Green’s Theorem. Interchanging φ1 and φ2 in (3.16) and
subtracting the result from (3.16) gives
  
[φ1∇2φ2 + φ2∇2φ1]dV =
 
⃗n · (φ1∇φ2 −φ2∇φ1)dS
=
 
(φ1
∂φ2
∂n −φ2
∂φ1
∂n )dS
(3.17)
This is the second (and generally more useful) form of Green’s Theorem. ∂/∂n
denotes a derivative in the direction of the normal. Let us consider several special
but informative cases.
(a) φ1 = φ2 = φ in (4.3.16)
  
[φ∇2φ + ∇φ · ∇φ]dV =

Now ∇2(1/r) = 0 everywhere except at r = 0. Thus

∇2(1/r)dV

and from the Divergence Theorem (3.15), this volume integral may be written as a
surface integral, viz

where we consider a small sphere of radius, ε, say, in evaluating the surface integral.
Now
φ1(r = 0) = φ1(x1 = x, y1 = y, z1 = z) = φ1(x, y, z)
Thus (3.20) becomes
φ1(x, y, z) = −1

(3.21)
The choice of φ2 = 1/r may seem rather arbitrary. This can be motivated by
noting that
∇2φ2
4π
= −δ(x −x1)δ(y −y1)δ(z −z1)
Hence we seek a φ2 which is the response to a delta function. This is what leads to
the simpliﬁcation of the volume integral.
3.3
Incompressible, Three-Dimensional Flow
To simplify matters we will ﬁrst conﬁne ourselves to M = 0. However, similar,
but more complex calculations subsequently will be carried out for M ̸= 0.16 For
incompressible ﬂow, the equation of motion is
∇2φ = 0
or
∇2 p = 0
where φ and p are (perturbation) velocity potential and pressure respectively. Hence
we may identify φ1 in (3.21) with either variable as may be convenient. To conﬁrm
to convention in the aerodynamic theory literature, we will take the normal positive
into the ﬂuid and introduce a minus sign into (3.21) which now reads:

Thus once γ (and hence ) is known, C p is readily computed. We therefore seek to
solve (3.40) for γ. The advantage of (3.40) over (3.36)–(3.39) is that we have reduced
the problem by one variable, having eliminated z. A brief derivation of (3.40) is given
below.

The lower limit x = −b in (3.40) follows from the fact that p = 0 for x < −b (on
z = 0) implies that φ = φx = 0 for x < −b. This will be made more explicit when
we consider x > b where p = 0 does not imply φ = φx = 0! See discussion below.
Also one can calculate γ for x > b in terms of γ for b < x < b by using the
condition that C p = 0 (continuous pressure) for x > b. This is helpful in solving

Note: Other ‘solving kernels’ exist, but they do not satisfy the Kutta condition, γ(x∗)
ﬁnite at x∗= 1, i.e., ﬁnite pressure at the trailing edge.
One might reasonably inquire, how do we know what the solving kernel should be?
Perhaps the most straightforward way to motivate the choice is to recognize that the
solution for steady ﬂow can be obtained by other methods. Probably the simplest of
these alternative solution methods is to use the transformations x∗cos θ, ξ∗= cos φ
and expand γ and wa in Fourier series in φ and θ. See BAH, p. 216. Once the
answer is known, i.e., (3.51), the choice of the solving kernel is fairly obvious. The
advantage of the solving kernel approach over the other methods is that it is capable
of extension to unsteady airfoil motion where an analytical solution may be obtained
as will be described below. On the other hand a method that is based essentially
on the Fourier series approach is often employed to obtain numerical solutions for
three-dimensional, compressible ﬂow. This is the so-called Kernel Function approach
discussed earlier.
In the above we have obtained the following integral relation: Given
f (x∗) = −1

The issue has arisen again because of possible applications to feedback control of

Representative Numerical Results
Consider a ﬂat plate airfoil, initially at zero angle of attack, which is given a step
change in α, i.e.,
w = −U∞α
for
t > 0
= 0
for
t < 0
Although most calculations in practice are carried out for sinusoidal time dependent
motion, for our purposes examining aerodynamic pressures due to this step change
leads to more insight into the nature of the physical system. Of course, in principle,
the results for sinusoidal motion (or a step change) may be superposed to obtain
results for arbitrary time dependent motion.

24This can be shown by considering the transient analysis of Sect.2 and noting it still applies for
t = 0+.

Indeed the pressure reaches this ﬁnal steady state value at a ﬁnite s which can be
determined as follows. All disturbances propagate in the ﬂuid with the speed of
sound, a∞, but the airfoil moves faster with velocity U∞> a∞. Hence, the elapsed
time for all disturbances (created by the step change of α for the airfoil) to move off
the airfoil is the time required for a (forward propagating in the ﬂuid) disturbance at
the leading edge to move to the trailing edge, namely
t = c/(U∞−a∞)
or, in nondimensional form,
s ≡tU∞
c/2 =
2M∞
M∞−1
For
s >

steady state conditions are obtained all along the airfoil. As can be seen from Fig.10
for s = 0+ the leading edge pressure instantly reaches its ﬁnal steady state value. As
s increases the steady state is reached by increasing portions of the airfoil along the
chord. Note that the initial results, s = 0, and steady state results,

Transonic Flow
Major progress has been made in recent years on this important topic. Here we
concentrate on the fundamental ideas and explore one simple approach to obtaining
solutions using the same mathematical methods previously employed for subsonic
and supersonic ﬂow.
The failure of the classical linear, perturbation theory in transonic ﬂow is well
known and several attempts have been made to develop a theoretical model which
will give consistent, accurate results. Among the more successful approximate meth-
ods that builds upon the classical approaches for subsonic and supersonic ﬂow is the
‘local linearization’ concept of Spreiter which has been generalized to treat oscil-
lating airfoils in transonic ﬂow [23]. Another valuable method is that of parametric
differentiation as developed by Rubbert and Landahl [24]. ‘Local linearization’ is
an ad hoc approximation while parametric differentiation is a perturbation proce-
dure from which the result of local linearization may be derived by making further
approximations. Several authors [25–28] have attacked the problem in a numerical
fashion using ﬁnite differences and results have been obtained for two and three-
dimensional, high subsonic ﬂow. This continues to be an active subject of research
and will be discussed further in chapter “Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction”.
Cunningham [29]. Has suggested a relatively simple, empirical modiﬁcation of the
classical theory.

232
E. H. Dowell
In the present section a rational approximation method27 is discussed which is
broadly related to the local linearization concept. It has the advantages of (1) being
simpler than the latter (2) capable of being systematically improved to obtain an
essentially exact solution to the governing transonic equation. Although the method
has been developed for treating inﬁnitesimal dynamic motions of airfoils of ﬁnite
thickness, it may also be employed (using the concept of parametric differentiation)
to obtain solutions for nonlinear, steady nonlifting ﬂows. This is a problem for which
local linearization’ was originally developed.
First, the basic idea will be explained for an inﬁnitesimal steady motion of an
airfoil of ﬁnite thickness in two-dimensional ﬂow. Results will also be given for
dynamic motion. The aerodynamic Green’s functions for three-dimensional ﬂow
have also been derived. These are needed in the popular Mach Box and Kernel
Function methods [31]. Using Green’s functions derived by the present methods,
three-dimensional calculations are effectively no more difﬁcult than for the classical
theory.

It may be shown that ML is the consistent transonic, small perturbation approx-
imation to the local (rather than free stream) Mach number. Hence, the essence of
transonic small perturbation theory is the allowance for variable, local Mach num-
ber rather than simply approximating the local Mach number by M∞as in the usual
subsonic and supersonic theories.

This is done both for its interest in the present context as well as a prototype for
estimation of terms in analyses of this general type.
We assume that a length scale, L, and a time scale, T , may be chosen so that
x∗≡x/L
‘is of order one’
t∗≡t/T
‘is of order one’
Hence, derivatives with respect to x∗or t∗do not, by assumption, change the order
or size of a term. Thus (5.6) and (5.7) may be written (ignoring constants of order
one like γ −1 and 2) as
A ≡

This ratio however, is much less than one by our original assumption of a small
perturbation, viz.
φ = U∞Lx∗+ ˆφ
In the beginning we have assumed
ˆφ
U∞Lx∗≪1
Hence (5.6) may be neglected compared to (5.7).
Equation(5.5) is a nonlinear equation even though we have invoked small pertur-
bation ideas. One may develop a linear theory by considering a steady ﬂow due to
airfoil shape, ˆφs and an inﬁnitesimal time dependent motion of the airfoil superim-
posed, ˆφd. For deﬁniteness, one may consider φs as due to an airfoil of symmetric
thickness at zero angle of attack. Thus let
ˆφ(x, y, z, t) = ˆφs(x, y, z) + ˆφd(x, y, z, t)
(5.6)
and substitute into (5.5). The equations for φs is (by deﬁnition)

ˆφd is velocity potential due to the inﬁnitesimal motion (henceforthˆand d are dropped

thickness and is taken as known. In general, it is a function of x, y, z and the method
to be described will, in principle, allow for such dependence. However, all results
have been obtained ignoring the dependence on y and z. See Refs. [23, 24, 32] for
discussion of this point.

a ﬁnite result is obtained for ˆps as M∞→1 which is in reasonable agreement with

Equation (5.7) with the full expression for ML is a nonlinear partial differential
equation which is much more difﬁcult to solve than its linear counterpart. How-
ever two types of methods have proven valuable, the numerical Finite difference
methods 29 and various techniques associated with the name ‘local linearization’ as
pioneered by Oswatitsch and Spreiter [33].
Once ˆφs is known (either from theory or experiment) (5.8) may be used to deter-
mine ˆφd. Equation(5.8) is a linear differential equation with variable coefﬁcients
which depend upon ˆφs. Hence, the solution for the lifting problem, ˆφd, depends
upon the thickness solution, ˆφs, unlike the classical linear theory where the two may
be calculated separately and the results superimposed. Again either ﬁnite difference
methods or ‘local linearization’ may be employed to solve (5.8). Here we pursue
an improved analytical technique to determine ˆφd, which has been developed in the
spirit of ‘local linearization’ ideas [30].
To explain the method most concisely, let φy = φt = 0 in Eq.(5.8), i.e., consider
two-dimensional, steady ﬂow.

If φ′ ≪φ0, i.e., φ0 is a good approximation to the solution, then φ′ may be
computed from (4.5.8b) by neglecting φ′ in the right hand side. The retention of
a0 (but not b1) in (4.5.8a) is the key to the method, even though this may seem
inconsistent at ﬁrst.
We begin our discussion with steady airfoil motion in a two-dimensional ﬂow.
This is the simplest case from the point of view of computation, of course; how-
ever, it is also the most critical in the sense that, as Landahl [32] and others have
pointed out, unsteadiness and/or three-dimensionality alleviate the nonlinear tran-
sonic effects. Indeed, if the ﬂow is sufﬁciently unsteady and/or three-dimensional,
the classical linear theory gives accurate results transonically for thin wings.
Steady airfoil motion in two-dimensional, ‘supersonic’ (b0 > 0) ﬂow
Solution for φ0. For b0 > 0, x is a time-like variable and the ﬂow is undisturbed
ahead of the airfoil (as far as φ0 is concerned). Hence, solutions may be obtained
using a Laplace transform with respect to x. Deﬁning

Results and comparisons with other theoretical and experimental data
We have calculated two examples, a Guderley airfoil and a parabolic arc airfoil,
both of 6% thickness ratio, τ, and for Mach numbers near one. These were chosen
because they have smooth mean steady pressure distributions (at least for some Mach
number range) and because other investigators have obtained results for these airfoils.
These two airfoils and their mean, steady pressure distributions are shown in [23].
The Guderley airfoil had a linear mean pressure variation while the parabolic arc
has a somewhat more complicated variation including a (theoretical) logarithmic
singularity at the leading edge. For M∞= 1, when C pms = 0 the local Mach number
along the chord equals one and if one expanded about the point then b0 = 0, and our
procedure would fail in that φ′ ≫φ0. Hence, one is lead to believe that one should

choose x0 as far away from the sonic point, C pms ≡0 at M∞≡1, as possible. To ﬁx
this idea more concretely, we ﬁrst considered the Guderley airfoil. Guderley airfoil.
We have calculated C0
p and C0
p + C′
p for M∞= 1. Two different choices of x0 were
used, x0 = c/2 (Fig.18) and c (Fig.19). Results from Stahara and Spreiter [23] are
also shown for reference. As can be seen for x0 = c/2, the ‘correction’ term, C′
p2,
dominates the basic solution, C0
p, as x/c →0. For x0 = c, on the other hand, the
correction term is much better behaved, in agreement with our earlier speculation
about choosing x0 as far as possible from the sonic point. Note that if, for example,
we choose x0 = 0 this would also work in principle, but now b0 < 0, and a ‘subsonic’
solution would have to be obtained for φ0.
Parabolic arc airfoil. Similar results have been obtained and are displayed in
Fig.20 (x0 = c/2) and Fig.21 (x0 = c0). Both of these solutions are well behaved
in the sense that C′
p < C0
p, though again the results for x0 = c appear to be better
than those for x0 = c/2. The relatively better behavior of the x0 = c/2 results for the
parabolic arc as compared with the Guderley airfoil is probably related to the sonic
point being farther ahead of x0 = c/2 for the former than the latter. See [23]. Also
shown in Figs.20 and 21 are the theoretical results of Stahara-Spreiter [23] and the
experimental data of Knechtel [35]. Knechtel indicates the effective Mach number
of his experiments should be reduced by approximately 0.03 due to wall interface
effects. Also he shows that the measured mean steady pressure distributions at zero
angle of attack, C pms, agree well with the theoretical results of Spreiter [23, 36] for
M∞≥1. However, for M∞≤1, C pms deviates from that theoretically predicted; see
Fig.22 taken from [35]. The change in slope for C pms near the trailing edge may be
expected to be important for computing the lifting case. In Fig.23 results are shown
for M∞= 0.9 which dramatically make this point. Shock induced separation of the
boundary layers is the probable cause of the difﬁculty.

Solution for φ′. Park [37] has computed φ′ and made comparisons with available
experimental and theoretical data. It is well-known, of course, that for sufﬁciently
large k the classical theory itself is accurate transonically [32]. Hence, we also expect
the present theory to be more accurate for increasing k.
Results and comparison with other theoretical data
We have calculated a numerical example for the Guderley airfoil for M = 1 and
k = 0.5 in order to compare with the results of Stahara-Spreiter [23]. We have chosen
x0 = c/2 for which
b0 = 0.12;
a0 = 1.2/c
For such small b0, we may use the asymptotic form for b0 →0, (5.32), and the results
are plotted in Figs.25 and 26 along with the results of [23].
As k →0, the phase angle,  is a constant at 90◦and the pressure coefﬁcient
amplitude is the same as that of Fig.18. Presumably somewhat more accurate results
could be obtained by choosing x0 = c and computing the correction, C′
p. However,
the agreement is already good between the present results and those of [23].
As Stahara-Spreiter [23] point out even for k as large as unity there are still sub-
stantial quantitative differences between their results (and hence the present results)

and those of the classical theory. However, for k ≫1, one may expect the present
theory and that of [23] to give results which approach those of the classical theory.

The above derivation, though lengthy, is entirely analogous to the classical one. For
a0 →0, B →1 −M2
∞we retrieve the known result [31].
It should be noted that in the above derivation we have assumed Re ˜a0 > 0 and thus
Re  < 0. This permits both the radiation and ﬁniteness conditions to be satisﬁed as
z →±∞. For Re ˜a0 < 0 one may not satisfy both conditions and one must choose
between them.
Asymmetric Mean Flow
In the above derivations we have assumed a mean ﬂow about symmetrical airfoils
at zero angle of attack and considered small motions of that conﬁguration. It is of
interest to generalize this to a mean ﬂow about asymmetrical airfoils at nonzero
angles of attack. First consider the Mach box form of the integral relation between
velocity potential and downwash, cf. Eq. (5.36),
φU =

AU(x −ξ, y −η)wU(ξ, η)dξ dη
(5.57)
Here we have written the relation as though we knew wU everywhere on z = 0+.
We do not, of course, and thus the need for the Mach box procedure [31]. Here
AU is that calculated using upper surface parameters, ignoring the lower surface. A
similar relation applies for the lower surface with AU replaced by −AL. Hence, we
may compute from (5.57) (for lifting motions where wU = wL ≡w on and off the
airfoil)
φU −φL =

A(x −ξ, y −η)w(ξ, η)dξ dη
(5.58)
where
A ≡AU + AL

Nonsteady Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces
253
is the desired aerodynamic inﬂuence function. Note that AU and AL are the same
basic function, but in one the upper surface parameters are used and in the other the
lower surface parameters.
Using the Kernel Function approach the situation is somewhat more complicated.
Here we have, cf. Eq.(5.55),
wU =

KU(x −ξ, y −η)pU(ξ, η)dξ dη
(5.59)
Note KU = 2Kp where Kp is the Kernel Function for p when the lower surface
mean ﬂow parameters are the same as those of the upper surface.
A similar equation may be written for wL and pL with KU replaces by −KL. Again
we note wL = wU ≡w. These two integral equations must be solved simultaneously
for pU and pL with given w. Hence, the number of unknowns one must deal with is
doubled for different upper and lower surface parameters. This poses a substantial
addition burden on the numerics. There is a possible simpliﬁcation, however. Deﬁne
K ≡KU + KL
2
;
K ≡KU −KL
2
(5.60)
If (K/K)2 ≪1, then on may simply use K, i.e., the average of the upper and lower
surface kernel functions. Formally, one may demonstrate this using perturbation ideas
as follows.
Using (5.59) (and its counterparts for the lower surface) and (5.60) one may
compute
wu + wL ≡2w =

[K(pU −pL) + K(pU + pL)]dξ dη
and
wu −wL ≡0 =

[K(pU + pL) + K(pU −pL)]dξ dη
(5.61)
From the second of these equations, the size of the terms may be estimated.
pU + pL
pU −pL
∼0
K
K

Thus in the ﬁrst of (5.61) the two terms on the right hand side are of order
K(pU −pL)
and
(K)2
K
(pU −pL)
The second terms may be neglected if
(K/K)2 ≪1
(5.62)

254
E. H. Dowell
and (5.61) may be approximated as
w(x, y) ≈

K
2 (x −ξ, y −η)p(ξ, η)dξ dη
(5.63)
where
p ≡pU −pL
Equation(5.62) would not appear to be unduly restrictive condition for some appli-
cations.
The development in this section is not dependent upon the particular method used
to compute KU and/or KL elsewhere in the text. The crucial assumptions are that (1)
the oscillating motion is a small perturbation to the mean ﬂow and (2) the difference
between the upper and lower surface Kernel functions is small compared to either.

Concluding Remarks
A relatively simple, reasonably accurate and systematic procedure has been devel-
oped for transonic ﬂow. A measure of the simplicity of the method is that all numer-
ical results presented herein were computed by hand and analytical forms have
been obtained for general ‘supersonic’ Mach number and airfoil motion for two-
dimensional ﬂow. For three-dimensional ﬂow the relevant Green’s functions have
been determined which may be used in the Kernel Function and Mach Box numeri-
cal lifting surface methods.
This approach has been extended to include a more accurate form of Bernoulli’s
equation and airfoil boundary condition. Also numerical examples are now available
for two dimensional airfoils in transient motion and three dimensional steady ﬂow
over a delta wing. Finally a simple correction for shock induced ﬂow separationhas
been suggested.31
For a highly readable survey of transonic ﬂow, the reader should consult the paper
by Spreiter and Stahara [39].
Also important advances in ﬁnite difference and ﬁnite element solutions are dis-
cussed in the following papers (all presented at the AIAA Dynamic Specialists Con-
ference, San Diego, March 1977): Chan and Chen [40], Ballhaus and Goorjian [41]
and Isogai [42].
In an important, but somewhat, neglected paper Eckhaus [43] gave a transonic ﬂow
model including shock waves which considered a constant supersonic Mach number
ahead of the shock and a constant subsonic Mach number behind it. An obvious
next step is to combine the Eckhaus and Dowell models. M.H. Williams [44] has
extended Eckhaus’ results by utilizing a somewhat broader theoretical formulation
and obtaining more accurate and extensive solutions. He has compared his results
31Dowell [38].

experiment is shown here in Fig.27 for a NACA 64 A006 airfoil with a trailing
edge quarter chord oscillating ﬂap. The measured steady state shock strength and
location for no ﬂap. The measured steady state shock strength and location for no ﬂap
oscillation is used as an input to the theoretical model. Since the ﬂap is downstream of
the shock, the theory predicts no disturbance upstream of the shock. The experiment
shows the upstream effect is indeed small. Moreover the agreement on the pressure
peaks at the shock and at the slap hinge line is most encouraging. It would appear
the transonic airfoil problem is ﬁnally yielded to a combination of analytical and

numerical methods. As Tijdeman and other have emphasized, however, the effects of
the viscous boundary layer may prove signiﬁcant for some applications. In particular
the poorer agreement between theory and experiment for the imaginary pressure
peak at the shock in Fig.27 is probably due to the effects of viscosity. The same
theoretical model has also been studied by Goldstein et al. for cascades with very
interesting results [46]. Rowe, a major contributor to subsonic aerodynamic solution
methods, has in the same spirit discussed how the classical boundary conditions and
Bernoulli’s equation can be modiﬁed to partially account for transonic effects as the
airfoil critical mach number is approached [47].

Stall Flutter
Fernando Sisto
Abstract Stall ﬂutter is an inherently nonlinear dynamic aeroelastic phenomena and
this chapter presents phenomenological models that provide fundamental insights
into this complex topic.
As the name implies, stall ﬂutter is a phenomenon which occurs with partial or
complete separation of the ﬂow from the airfoil occurring periodically during the
oscillation. In contrast to classical ﬂutter (i.e., ﬂow attached at all times) the mech-
anism for energy transfer from the airstream to the oscillating airfoil does not rely
on elastic and/or aerodynamic coupling between two modes, nor upon a phase lag
between a displacement and its aerodynamic reaction. These latter effects are neces-
sary in a linear system to account for an airstream doing positive aerodynamic work
on a vibrating wing. The essential feature of stall ﬂutter is the nonlinear aerodynamic
reaction to the motion of the airfoil/structure. Thus, although coupling and phase lag
may alter the results somewhat, the basic instability and its principal features must
be explained in terms of nonlinear normal force and moment characteristics.

Background
Stall ﬂutter of aircraft wings and empennages is associated with very high angles of
attack. Large incidence is necessary to induce separation of the ﬂow from the suction
surface. This type of operating condition and vibratory response was observed as
long ago as World War I at which time stall ﬂutter occurred during sharp pull-up
maneuvers in combat. The surfaces were usually monoplane without a great deal
of effective external bracing. The cure was to stiffen the structure and avoid the
dangerous maneuvers whenever possible.
Electric power transmission cables of circular cross-section, or as modiﬁed by
bundling or by ice accretion, etc., and structural shapes of various description are

classiﬁed as bluff bodies. As such they do not require large incidence for ﬂow sepa-
ration to occur. In fact incidence is chieﬂy an orientation parameter for these airfoils
rather than an indication of the level of steady aerodynamic loading. Again, largely
attributable to the nonlinearity in the force and moment as a function of incidence,
such structures are prone to stall ﬂutter. These vibrations are sometimes called ‘gal-
loping’ as in the case of transmission lines. The number and classes of structures
that potentially could experience stall ﬂutter are very great, and include such diverse
examples as suspension bridges, helicopter rotors and turbomachinery blades. More
mundane examples are venetian blind slats and air deﬂectors or spoilers on automo-
biles.
The stall ﬂutter of non-airfoil structures is described at greater length in chapter
‘Aeroelasticity in Civil Engineering’, along with galloping and buffeting. These are
all closely related bluff body phenomena from the point of view of vortex method
aerodynamics, a subject which is introduced later in the present chapter. The stall ﬂut-
ter of rotorcraft blades is described in greater detail in chapter ‘Aeroelastic Response
of Rotorcraft’ where the special kinematic restraints of these rotating structures
lead to a unique aeroelastic description. The stall ﬂutter of turbomachinery blades
is described more fully in chapter ‘Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines’, wherein it is
observed that the aeroelastic behavior in stall ﬂutter is distinct from both non-airfoil
structures and rotorcraft blades.
When the ﬂow ﬁeld is measured or visualized during stall ﬂutter oscillations it
is observed that free vortices are generated in the vicinity of the separation points.
These large vortical structures are shed periodically creating regions of reduced and
even reversed velocity in the vicinity of the airfoil. For this reason the aforemen-
tioned technique known as the vortex method has been developed recently for the
computational modelling of unsteady separation aerodynamics.
It may be shown that the mutual induction, or interaction, of as few as three
vortices leads to chaotic behavior. Thus it is conﬁrmed by computation that use of
vortex method aerodynamics displays many of the nonlinear aeroelastic phenomena
actually observed experimentally in conjunction with stall ﬂutter.

Analytical Formulation
Although analysis of stall ﬂutter based on computational unsteady aerodynamics is
becoming feasible, it is nevertheless instructive to couch the problem in analytical
terms so as to discriminate clearly the actual mechanism of instability [1]. We will
consider two important cases: bending and twisting.
In the case of bending, or plunging displacement of a two-dimensional ‘typical
section’ airfoil, let us assume that the force coefﬁcient, including penetration well
into the stall regime, is given by a polynomial approximation in α,

where α is the instantaneous departure from the steady state value of angle of attack,
αss, attributable to vibration of the airfoil. This method of expressing the normal force
characteristic gives a good local ﬁt with a few terms. However, the coefﬁcients, αn,

direction as positive displacement h. (In the usual (static) theory of thin unstalled and
uncambered proﬁles −Cn = π sin 2αss. The αn could then be obtained by deriving
the Maclaurin series expansion of π sin 2(αss + α) considered as a function of α).
In general the −Cn function is an empirically determined function, or characteristic,
when stall occurs on a cambered airfoil, but the procedure is still the same. The αn
are in fact given by the slope and higher order derivatives according to

We next consider a small harmonic bending oscillation

A slight concession to the dynamics of stalling may be introduced by the inclusion
of a time delay, /ω, in the oscillatory velocity term appearing in the Cn expansion,

Stability and Aerodynamic Work
As is common with single degree of freedom systems such as that postulated above,
the question of ampliﬁcation or subsidence of the amplitude of the initial motion
can easily be decided on the basis of the work done by this force acting on the
displacement. Thus

zero. Restricting the series expansions for −Cn and α to their leading terms such

Bending Stall Flutter
The analytical expression for the aerodynamic power in a sinusoidal bending vibra-
tion is too cumbersome for easy physical interpretation. However, for very small
amplitudes of motion, as might be triggered by turbulence in the ﬂuid, or other
‘noise’ in the system, it is clear that the sign of the work ﬂow will be governed by

the coefﬁcient of (ωh0/V )2. Assuming a small to moderate positive mean incidence,
αss, the coefﬁcient α0 will be positive. With cos  near unity, a positive power can
only occur if α1 is sufﬁciently negative, i.e., if the −Cn versus α characteristic has
a negative slope at the static operating incidence. More precisely, if |ψ| < 90◦and
a1 < −2a0 tan αss sec ψ
(4.1)
the small amplitude vibration is unstable and the work ﬂow will be such as to feed
energy into the vibration and increase its amplitude.
In the previous expression for the power, (3.3a),

coefﬁcients of the power series representation of the normal force characteristic. For

In the general case A, B and C individually may be either positive, zero or negative.
The several possible cases are of fundamental interest in describing possible bending
stall ﬂutter behavior. I. A < 0, B < 0, C < 0 No ﬂutter is possible.
II. A > 0, B > 0, C > 0 Flutter amplitude grows from zero to very large values.
III. A > 0, B < 0, C < 0 Flutter amplitude grows smoothly from zero to a ﬁnite

the ﬂutter will continue to grow beyond that amplitude up to very large values. At
the critical amplitude the power is zero.

VII. A > 0, B < 0, C > 0 This case has behavior similar to case II if B is very
small and similar to case III if C is very small and also very large amplitudes are
excluded from consideration.
VIII. A < 0. B > 0, C < 0 This case behavior is similar to case I if B is very
small and similar to case IV if C is very small and also very large amplitudes are
excluded from consideration.

Nonlinear Mechanics Description
A number of these variations of power dependency on amplitude have been sketched
in Fig.2. Case II is an example of what may be termed ‘soft ﬂutter’; given an airstream
velocity V , incidence αss and time delay ψ/ω such as produce values of A, B and
C according to case II, the vibratory amplitude of ﬂutter might be expected to grow
smoothly from zero.
Cases III and V similarly are examples of soft ﬂutter; in these cases however,
the amplitude of vibration reaches a steady value and does not increase further.
An equilibrium ﬂutter amplitude is attained after a period of time and maintained
thereafter. If, in either of these cases, one were to plot h versus ˙h/ω with time as a

parameter, it would be found that the ‘trajectory’ of the ‘characteristic point’ would
be a spiral around the origin, beginning at the origin at t = 0 and asymptotically
approaching a circle of radius h0 for very large time. In the parlance of nonlinear
mechanics the circular path is a ‘limit cycle’ and hence most instances of stall ﬂutter
may be termed limit cycle vibrations.
CaseIV,oralternativelycaseVI,describesatypeofbehaviorwhichmaybetermed
‘hard ﬂutter’. In this situation when ﬂutter appears as a self-sustaining oscillation, the
amplitude is immediately a large ﬁnite value. Here the motion spirals away from the
circular limit cycle to either large or smaller amplitudes in the phase plane (i.e., the
h, ˙h/ω plane). This example is an instance in which the limit cycle is unstable. The
slightest perturbation from an initially pure circular path, either to larger or smaller
radii, will result in monotonic spiralling away from the limit cycle. The previous
example of case III illustrated the case of a stable limit cycle.
The origin of the phase plane is also a degenerate limit cycle in the sense that the
limit of a circle is a point in which case only path radii larger than zero have physical
meaning. However, the origin may be an unstable limit cycle (soft ﬂutter) or a stable
limit cycle (hard ﬂutter).
It is clear from a consideration of cases VII and VIII that more than two limit
cycles may obtain; it is a theorem of mechanics that the concentric circles which are
limit cycles of a given system are alternately stable and unstable.

Torsional Stall Flutter
With pure twisting motion of the proﬁle, the analytical formulation is more complex
stemming from the fact that the dynamic angle of incidence is compounded of two
effects: the instantaneous angular displacement and the instantaneous linear velocity
inadirectionnormaltothechordposition;thesecondmagnitudeislinearlydependent
upon the distance along the chord from the elastic axis and upon the frequency of
vibration. Both components, of course, vary harmonically with the frequency ω.
Thus, assuming a displacement θ0 cos ωt the ‘local’ angle of attack becomes

(6.2)
Since the local incidence varies along the chord in the torsional case, it is not possible
to formulate the twisting problem in a simple and analogous manner to the bending
case unless a single ‘typical’ incidence is chosen. For incompressible potential ﬂow,

thin airfoil theory, it is known [2] that the three-quarter chord point is ‘most repre-
sentative’ in relating changes in incidence to changes in aerodynamic reaction for an
unstalled thin airfoil with parabolic camber. Replacing x −x0 by a constant, say eb,
for simplicity, one has by analogy with bending (Fig.3)

where α is, again, the departure in angle of attack from αss. The constant e will
normally be of order unity for an elastic axis location forward of midchord.
From this point onward, the illustrative analysis involves the substitution of α into
an analytical approximation for the aerodynamic moment coefﬁcient

and this expression, in turn inserted into the integrand of (6.7), will allow an analytical
expression to be derived by quadrature.
At this stage in the development of torsional stall ﬂutter, a key difference emerges
more clearly when compared to bending stall ﬂutter; a fundamental component of the
moment coefﬁcient appears (b1θ0 cos ωt) which is out of phase with the torsional
velocity ( ˙θ = −ωθ0 sin ωt). Noting that ˙θ is the second factor in the integrand, it
is seen that the ﬁnal integrated expression for the power will have terms similar in
nature to the expression derived for the bending case, and in addition may have terms
proportional to
b1θ0, b2θ2
0, b2θ0, b3θ3
0, b3θ2

It is not particularly instructive to set out this result in full detail.

We conclude from this equation that the work ﬂow again will be proportional to a
sum of terms in even powers of the vibratory amplitude, but in this instance, the low
frequency torsional stall ﬂutter is critically dependent on the time lag ψ/ω between
the oscillatory motion and the response of the periodic aerodynamic moment.
Torsional stall ﬂutter is thus seen to be a much more complex phenomenon, with a
greater dependence on time lag and exhibiting very strong dependence on the location
of the elastic axis. For example, if the elastic axis were artiﬁcially moved rearward
on an airfoil such as to reduce the effective value of the parameter e to zero, the airfoil

ﬂutter behavior would be governed by exactly the same specialization of the analysis
as was just termed ‘low frequency’. Exactly the same terms would be eliminated from
consideration. In qualitative terms one may also conclude that the actual behavior in
torsional ﬂutter in the general case (with e ̸= 0) is some intermediate state between
the low frequency behavior (critical dependence on sin ψ) and a type of behavior
characteristic of bending stall ﬂutter (critical dependence on the slope of a dynamic
characteristic at the mean incidence).

General Comments
An interesting by-product of the nonlinear nature of stall ﬂutter is the ability, in prin-
ciple, to predict the ﬁnal equilibrium amplitude of the vibration. This is in contradis-
tinction to classical ﬂutter in which only the stability boundary is usually determined.
The condition for constant ﬁnite ﬂutter amplitude is that the work, or power ﬂow,
again be zero. As we have seen this can be discerned when the power equation is
set equal to zero; the resulting quadratic equation is solved for the squared ﬂutter
amplitude, either (h0/b)2 or θ2
0 as the case may be. Since all the an or bn coefﬁcients
are functions of αss, the two types of ﬂutter are displayed in Fig. 4 as presumed func-
tions of this parameter. Hard ﬂutter displays a sudden jump to ﬁnite amplitude as a
critical parameter is varied and a lower ‘quench’ value of that parameter where the
vibration suddenly disappears. The two effects conspire to produce the characteristic
hysteresis loop indicated by arrows in Fig.4.
In summary then, stall ﬂutter is associated with nonlinearity in the aerodynamic
characteristic; the phenomenon may occur in a single degree of freedom and the
amplitude of vibratory motion will often be limited by the aerodynamic nonlinear-
ities. Although structural material damping has not been considered explicitly, it is
clear that since damping is an absorber of energy its presence will serve to limit the
ﬂutter amplitudes to smaller values; damping limited amplitudes will obtain when
Fig. 4 Flutter amplitude versus steady state angle of attack

F. Sisto
the positive power ﬂow from airstream to airfoil equals the power conversion to heat
in the mechanical forms of damping.
It is also clear that motion in a third degree of freedom is possible. Oscillatory
surging of the airfoil in the chordwise direction can be related to a nonlinear behavior
in the drag acting on the proﬁle. However, airfoils are usually very stiff structurally
in the chordwise direction and the drag/surging mechanism would normally be of
importance only for bluff structural shapes such as bundles of electric power con-
ductors suspended between towers, etc.
Under certain circumstances such as the example noted directly above, stall ﬂutter
in more than one degree of freedom may occur. In these cases, the dynamic charac-
teristics of normal force, aerodynamic moment (and drag) become functions of an
effective incidence compounded of many sources: plunging velocity, torsional dis-
placement, torsional velocity and surging velocity. The resultant power equation will
also contain cross-product terms in the various displacement amplitudes, and hence
the equation cannot be used to predict stability or equilibrium ﬂutter amplitudes
without additional information concerning the vibration modes.
Perhaps the greatest deﬁciency in the theory, however, is the fact that even in
pure bending motion or pure torsional motion, the dynamic force and moment are
in fact frequency dependent: an = an(αss, k) and bn = bn(αss, k). And in general
a0 ̸= −Cnss and b0 ̸= −Cmss. In analogy with classical ﬂutter it may be shown that
even this dependence is deﬁcient in that the characteristics in practice may be double
valued. That is, for the same value of effective incidence α, the characteristic may
have different values depending upon whether α is decreasing or increasing with
time. Such a hysteretic characteristic is usually more pronounced at high frequencies
of oscillation; an airfoil may have two lift or moment coefﬁcients at a particular
angle of attack even in the static case, depending upon how the operating point was
approached.
It is for these reasons that practical stall ﬂutter prediction has been at best a semi-
empirical process, and often entirely empirical. A model is oscillated in torsion, or
bending, in a wind tunnel under controlled conditions with parametric variation of
reduced frequency, mean incidence and oscillatory amplitude. Various elastic axis
locations also may be studied. Data which are taken may vary from instantaneous
normal force and moment down to the actual time-dependent pressure distribution
on the proﬁle. Data reduction consists essentially of cross-plotting the various data
so that ﬂutter prediction for prototype application is largely a matter of interpolation
in model data using dimensionless groups. Speciﬁc representative data will be taken
up in subsequent chapters where stall ﬂutter applications are studied.
An exception to the previous reliance on experimental data is a theory [3] which
postulates that the departure of the normal force and/or aerodynamic moment from
the classical (attached ﬂow) values can be modelled by considering a ﬂat plate with
separated ﬂow on the suction side. As the plate oscillates harmonically in time, the
position of the separation point (from which emanates a free streamline) is also
considered to move periodically with the same frequency as the oscillation. The
movement of the separation point along the suction surface is between two arbitrarily

Stall Flutter
271

speciﬁed upstream and downstream limits and with an arbitrarily speciﬁed phase
angle with respect to the oscillatory motion.
Under these circumstances, it is possible to solve the unsteady ﬂow problem (anal-
ogous to the classical Theodorsen solution for attached ﬂow) with separation present.
In effect the appropriate dynamic force and moment characteristics are generated for
each function specifying the separation point movement and airfoil motion. The
empirical part of the ﬂutter prediction technique then resides in correlation of the
separation point behavior as a function of the airfoil attitude and oscillatory motion.
To illustrate the potential of the technique, two moment loops from the reference
are shown in Fig.5. The one on the left is from an experimental program [4], the
one on the right is from [3]. Although the variation of moment with torsional dis-
placement is remarkably similar, it must be emphasized that the particular choice of
elastic axis location is different in experiment and theory, and the assumed separation
point behavior in the theory was reasonable, but quite arbitrary and unrelated to the
unknown separation point behavior in the experiment.
The method of modelling the separation region on the suction surface of the
airfoil by a free streamline issuing from the ‘separation’ point has been generalized
subsequently [5]. The method employs simultaneous integral equations and may be
applied to subsonic, small perturbation ﬂows of aeroelastic signiﬁcance. In particular,
for cascades of airfoils of interest in axial-ﬂow compressors [6], the method has
shown promise of improved stall ﬂutter prediction. A type of stall resulting in a
leading edge ‘bubble’ is also amenable to this type of small perturbation analysis
[7] and is more appropriate for sharp leading edges with onset ﬂows that result in
reattachment of the separation streamline.
These free-streamline methods are useful when the reattachment point and/or
separation point behavior can be predicted beforehand and the mean incidence is
not excessive. An example is the thin airfoil with small leading edge radius at mod-
erate incidence where the separation point is ‘anchored’ at the leading edge and
reattachment does not occur.

Reduced Order Models
As noted in chapter ‘Nonlinear Aeroelasticity’, Nonlinear Aeroelasticity, reduced
order models have been developed to help account for the effect of airfoil vibratory
displacement, velocity and acceleration on the associated aerodynamic responses.
Since the theoretical underpinning for these models is not ﬁrmly established for
conditions of massive ﬂow separation, the characteristics must be developed by
model ﬁtting from experimental data. For this reason these models have also been
termed “semi-empirical”.
In fact, a low order model is the quasisteady development presented in Sect.2
for the nonlinear normal force and moment characteristics. The linear quasisteady
development in chapter ‘Dynamic Aeroelasticity’ is another low order model. The
steady ﬂow aerodynamics example of that same chapter is of course the model of
lowest possible order.
Reduced order modelling for stall ﬂutter and bluff body aeroelasticity has been
studied by a number of investigators. Some of these studies are described in chapter
‘Nonlinear Aeroelasticity’ and references to much of the recent literature may be
found there. One important and representative study is that by Tang and Dowell
[16] in which many of the characteristics attributable to aerodynamic nonlinearities
appear. Example are the asymptotic approach to limit cycles and the development of
chaotic pitch displacement and moment coefﬁcient histories for particular values of
the advance ratio.

Computational Stalled Flow
In recent years the so-called vortex method has begun to be used to model periodically
separated ﬂow from bluff bodies [8, 9] as well as streamlined shapes [10] such as
airfoils. The vortex method is essentially a computational algorithm which tracks a
large collection of discrete vortices in time. Since it is a time-marching procedure,
the aerodynamic reactions are obtained with an evolving ﬂow and the aeroelastic
response of the structure must evolve in like manner. Hence stability of a speciﬁc
structure oriented in a speciﬁc ﬂow cannot be discriminated ab initio. The aeroelastic
vibration develops in the course of time; hence the method might equally be termed
computational ﬂuid elasticity (CFE). The power of the method may be appreciated
when it is realized that highly nonlinear aerodynamics (and structure as well) may
be modelled and ﬁnite amplitudes of the ﬂutter vibration may be predicted. The cost
of computation is high since fairly long runs on supercomputers are required for
acceptable accuracy.
The vortex method for modelling unsteady separated ﬂow as initiated in [10] and
modiﬁed in [11, 12] for oscillating airfoils, is based upon the following ﬂuid dynamic
system of equations.

For two-dimensional, viscous, incompressible ﬂow past an inﬁnite linear cascade
of airfoils at high Reynolds number, the basic aerodynamic equations that govern
the vorticity ﬁeld derived in [8] are as follows. (For a single airfoil the formulation
may be simpliﬁed from what is shown here).
Conservation of vorticity in the ﬂuid requires
Dω
Dt = v∇2ω
(9.1)
where the vorticity in the ﬂuid ﬁeld is
ω = ∂v
∂x −∂u
∂y
(9.2)
Vorticity within the solid is a continuation of the ﬂuid ﬁeld and represents the motion
(vibration) of the solid
ω = 2m
(9.3)
The boundary conditions in terms of vorticity can be written as [8]
 
v ∂ω
∂n

ds = −2Rm

(9.4)
The system of equations governing the vorticity and the system governing the
velocity and pressure are equivalent. A stream function ψ can be deﬁned to satisfy
the continuity equation
u = −∂ψ
∂y
and
v = ∂ψ
∂x
(9.5)
Combining (9.2) and (9.5) results in the Poisson equation
∇2ψ = ω
(9.6)
The vortex method represents the vorticity ﬁeld as the sum of a large number (N)
of vortex blobs
ω =

(9.7)
and the stream function induced by a collection of vortices is ψk, where
ψk = (k/4π)ln| sin[(2π/p)(z −zk)]|2
(9.8)

Here i = √−1 and the complex variable notation z = x + iy is used.
The instantaneous coordinates of the mth airfoil surface [x(t), y(t)] under coupled
bending-torsion with a frequency of f Hertz are given by
x(t) = x0 −h sin(2π f t + μ + mσ) sin β −y0 θ sin(2π f t + mσ)
(9.9a)
y(t) = y0 + h sin(2π f t + μ + mσ) cos β + x0 θ sin(2π f t + mσ)
(9.9b)
where (x0, y0) are coordinates for each airfoil without vibration and are measured
from its centroid, assumed here for simplicity to coincide with the center of twist. The
quantity μ refers to the intrablade phase angle which is the phase difference between
the bending and torsional modes. On the other hand, the interblade phase angle, σ,
represents the phase shift between neighboring blades. To obtain the corresponding
boundary conditions, the nonpenetration condition is imposed as expressed by (1.32).
With the deﬁnition of the stream function ∂ψ/∂s = Vn where s and n are local
coordinates parallel and normal to the wall, respectively, the incremental value of
stream function along each airfoil surface can be determined by
dψ|s =
	 s0+s
s0
Vnds =
	 s0+s
s0
(˙xbnx + ˙ybny)ds
(9.10)
This equation is used to determine the distribution of the values of the stream function
along the boundary points of the airfoils, and then to solve the vorticity-stream
function equations. As a consequence of the airfoil motion the values of the stream
functionarenot constant alongtheboundaryof theairfoil. It shouldalsobementioned
that the no-slip condition reﬂecting the nonzero viscosity of the ﬂuid is satisﬁed in a
weak sense, as discussed in [8].
Computations based on this system of equations have shown [12] that the two-
dimensional unsteady ﬂow, as exempliﬁed in a linear cascade of oscillating airfoils, is
properlypredictedforarangeofreducedfrequenciesatlowincidence.Resultssimilar
to those derivable analytically by the methods of Sect. 3 in chapter ‘Nonsteady Aero-
dynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’, and also in chapter ‘Aeroelasticity
in Turbomachines’ for cascades, are conﬁrmed by these computational procedures.
With this validation in hand it is possible then to consider larger values of the mean
incidence until stall is encountered, and compute the aerodynamic response under
intermittent separation, and ﬁnally, under complete or ‘deep’ stall. The rapid change
in amplitude and phase for lift due to plunging motion as the mean incidence is
increased in steps is shown in the following table, along with streamline pattern at
one instant for the highest incidence case, Fig.6.
The presence of strong vortices in the ﬂow illustrates an important stability mod-
iﬁcation mechanism present in stalled ﬂow. These coherent structures are subject to
a nonlinear eigenfunction/eigenfrequency interpretation associated entirely with the
ﬂow. A completely rigid airfoil (cascade of airfoils) is (are) subject to a ﬂow instabil-
ity identiﬁed as Karman vortex shedding [13] (propagating stall phenomenon). This
unsteady periodic behavior has a characteristic frequency and the associated ﬂow

patten is in the guise of an eigenfunction. Thus stall ﬂutter, in a modern interpreta-
tion, may be thought of as the aeroelastic coupling of ﬂuid and structure through the
vortex shedding and convection mechanism. If an airfoil natural frequency lies close
to a natural frequency of the ﬂow instability (either Karman vortex or propagating
stall), the vibration of the blade can ‘entrain’ the stall frequency, resulting in the shift
from a forced excitation at the ‘stall natural frequency’ to a self-excitation at the
ﬂutter frequency. This duality of frequencies may be observed in the lift response
spectrum during the ﬁrst few instants of the prescribed motion, Fig.7, for several
bending amplitudes.
In this ﬁgure two distinct frequencies are evident, one associated with the propa-
gating stall that would be present in the absence of any vibration, and the other at the
same frequency as the impressed vibration. At a later time the propagating frequency
has shifted and is essentially equal to the vibration frequency (which is always taken
to include the effect of apparent mass). Frequency synchronization has taken place.
Results of this nature have led to further modelling and computation with the
conclusion that stall ﬂutter can be predicted by a computational algorithm in which
the airfoil motion is not prescribed beforehand. In [14, 15] the vortex method aerody-

namic subprogram is executed in parallel and interactively with a structural dynamics
subprogram, theentirecomputationbeingcarriedforwardinatimemarchingfashion.
Figure8 from [14] is a computational conﬁrmation of the frequency entrainment
phenomenon previously hypothesized to occur for free vibrations. The temporal evo-
lution of the streamline pattern and the accompanying blade vibratory motion for one
datum point of Fig.8 is shown in Fig.9. The propagating stall frequency of a cascade
of blade s with ﬁxed geometry and onset ﬂow is seen to be relatively unaffected by the
presence of ﬂexible blades except in the neighborhood of those blades having natural
frequency near the intrinsic stall frequency. Within the interval of entrainment, how-
ever, the stall frequency is physically modiﬁed so as to synchronize with the blade

natural frequency. Within the entrainment interval stall ﬂutter may be said to occur.
In chapter ‘Aeroelasticity in Civil Engineering’ the synchronization phenomenon as
applied to bluff bodies is discussed in greater detail. Further studies are underway
to deﬁne the interval of synchronization as a function of the governing aeroelastic
parameters and to further deﬁne the stall ﬂutter behavior within this interval.
The vortex method possesses inherent limitations which are related to the two-
dimensionality of the assumed ﬂow and the necessity for a separation criterion
embedded in a boundary layer subroutine. These limitations would be removed with
the alternative development of Navier–Stokes solvers for full three-dimensional,
unsteady, compressible ﬂows. The principal difﬁculty to be overcome is the provi-
sion of an accurate turbulence model that will result in the necessary resolution of
the scale of turbulence for typical cascade geometry. And the much greater number
of computations required for this computational model, stemming from the multi-
plicity of blade passages, makes the forthcoming increase in computational speed
a necessary adjunct. Supercomputers, probably involving parallel processing, are a
necessity for reliable large scale Navier–Stokes solutions.

Abstract Fluid-structureinteractionoccursincivilengineeringapplicationstoﬂexi-
ble long span bridges and tall slender buildings. This chapter provides an authoritative
account of current best practices and modeling methods.
Certain types of civil engineering structures can be subjected to aerodynamic forces
generated by structural motions. These motions, called self-excited, are in turn
affected by the aerodynamic forces they generate. Behavior associated with self-
excited motions is called aeroelastic. The ﬂutter of the Brighton Chain Pier Bridge
(Fig.1) and, more than one century later, the original Tacoma-Narrows Bridge (Fig.2)
are notorious examples of aeroelastic behavior. Tall chimneys and buildings may
also respond aeroelastically and need to be designed accordingly. The John Hancock
building in Boston, which has a relatively ﬂat shape in plan (Fig.3), has experienced
across-wind and torsional motions of sufﬁcient severity to warrant the installation
of a large tuned-mass damper system at its top. These motions may have been due
to aeroelastic effects.1 Under certain conditions power lines experience aeroelastic
behavior referred to as galloping.
Aeroelastic phenomena of interest in civil engineering differ from those studied
in aeronautical engineering in two important ways. First, civil engineering structures
are typically bluff, although in modern suspended-span2 bridge design streamlined
box-like deck shapes are increasingly being used. Second, unlike ﬂows typically con-
sidered in aeronautical engineering, the ﬂows in which civil engineering structures
are immersed are in most cases turbulent. Atmospheric turbulence depends upon the
thermal stratiﬁcation of the ﬂow. At very high wind speeds mechanical turbulence
is dominant and the air ﬂow may therefore be assumed to be neutrally stratiﬁed.
1Recent research on tall buildings with relatively large ratio between depth and width suggests that
this was indeed the case—see Sect.2.2.2. To the writers’ knowledge, for legal or other reasons,
detailed technical reports on the wind-induced behavior of the John Hancock building are not
available in the public domain.

Standard atmospheric models commonly used in wind engineering are applicable
in this case. However, atmospheric ﬂows are not necessarily neutrally stratiﬁed—
even at relatively high wind speeds. The actual ﬂow turbulence may therefore differ
substantially from, and in some cases be considerably weaker than, the turbulence
inherent in standard models.
To estimate the effects of the interaction between aerodynamic forces and struc-
tural motions it is in principle necessary to solve the Navier–Stokes equations for
turbulent ﬂow with time-dependent boundary conditions dependent on the solutions
themselves. This problem deﬁes analytical capabilities. It is also difﬁcult to solve
dependably by computational ﬂuid dynamic (CFD) methods, although continual
progress is being made in this ﬁeld, especially for non-turbulent ﬂows.
Given the limitations of analytical and numerical procedures, the aeroelastic char-
acterization of civil engineering structures relies largely on laboratory testing and
empirical modeling. Such testing is not always without its problems, however, and for
certain conditions it is necessary to assess carefully the applicability to the prototype
of laboratory test results and the associated empirical models. There are two reasons
for this. First, wind tunnels that achieve Reynolds numbers comparable to those typi-
cal of most types of civil engineering structures (e.g., high-pressure wind tunnels) are
currently not capable of simulating atmospheric turbulence, which can signiﬁcantly

affect bluff body aerodynamic and aeroelastic behavior. Second, wind tunnels that
simulate the features of atmospheric turbulence usually violate Reynolds number
similarity requirements by factors of the order of 100–1,000. Nevertheless, for most
structures with sharp edges at which ﬂow separation must occur both in the prototype
and the model, and for properly modeled structures with rounded shapes and rough
or ribbed surfaces, it is assumed in most cases that the violation of Reynolds number
similarity is relatively inconsequential, and that prudent use of laboratory test results
is warranted.
This chapter is divided into two main parts. The ﬁrst part is devoted to bluff
body aeroelasticity fundamentals pertaining to vortex-shedding related phenom-
ena (Sect.1.1), galloping (Sect.1.2), divergence (Sect.1.3), ﬂutter, and buffeting in
the presence of aeroelastic effects (Sect.1.4). The second part is concerned with
applications to suspended-span bridges (Sect.2.1), and tall chimneys and buildings
(Sect.2.2).

Vortex-Induced Oscillation
1.1.1
Vortex Shedding
The aeolian harp (named after Aeolus, the Greek god of winds) consists of a set of
parallel strings which, when exposed to wind, experience vibrations that produce
acoustical tones. The vibrations are caused by periodic lift forces associated with
vortex shedding, and were studied by Strouhal in 1878 [1]. The shedding of vortices
in the wake of circular cylinders was studied in 1908 by Bénard [2], after whom the
vortices are named in France. A few years later it was also studied by von Kármán [3].
The orderly array of vortices that forms in the wake of a cylinder is known as a von
Kármánstreet.3 ThecharacterofthevortexsheddingdependsuponReynoldsnumber,
the turbulence present in the oncoming ﬂow, and the turbulence in the boundary layer
that develops on the circular cylinder’s surface. These factors control the interplay
between viscous and inertial forces that determines the position of the boundary
layer’s separation point. Vortex shedding is not limited to circular cylinders; it also
occurs in the wake of prismatic bodies (Fig.4), and of non-cylindrical elongated
bodies such as tapered chimneys.
For long rigid cylindrical bodies in ﬂow with uniform mean speed, around which
the ﬂow may be assumed to be two-dimensional, the vortex shedding frequency fs
satisﬁes the relation
S = fs D/U
(1.1)
where D is the across-ﬂow dimension of the cylinder, U is the mean speed of the
oncoming ﬂow, and the Strouhal number S depends upon the cross-section of the
cylinder. (The assumption that the ﬂow is two-dimensional means that end effects
are assumed to affect negligibly the overall model behavior.) For smooth circular
cylinders S changes drastically at certain critical values of the Reynolds number
(see, e.g., [4]). However, for circular cylinders with rough surfaces no such critical
phenomena appear to have been observed [5, 6, p. 151]. The Strouhal number is
listed in [6] for a variety of shapes of interest in structural engineering under uniform,
smooth ﬂow conditions.
The shedding of vortices in the wake of a body gives rise to an asymmetric ﬂow
(Fig.4) and, therefore, to an asymmetric pressure ﬁeld which induces on the body
ﬂuctuating lift forces, as well as relatively small drag force ﬂuctuations. In air ﬂow
the latter may in most applications be assumed to be negligibly small. Various aspects
of vortex shedding, including the dependence of the ﬂuctuating lift force acting on a
square cylinder upon the turbulence in the oncoming ﬂow, are discussed, for example,
in [6, 7].

If the body is not perfectly rigid, or if it has elastic supports, it will experience
motions due to the aerodynamic forces and, in particular, to the ﬂuctuating lift force.
As long as the motions are sufﬁciently small they do not affect the vortex shedding,
and Eq.1.1 remains valid. If the vortex-shedding frequency fs, and therefore the
frequency of the associated lift force, is equal to the natural frequency of vibration of
the body fn, then a relatively large motion ampliﬁcation occurs. Experiments show
that this is the case not only at the ﬂow speed fn D/S, but also at any ﬂow speed
U within an interval fn D/S −U < U < fn D/S + U, where U/U depends
upon cross-sectional shape and the mechanical damping, and is usually of the order of
few percent. Within that interval the vortex shedding frequency no longer conforms
to Eq.1.1; rather, it aligns itself to the frequency of vibration of the body.
This is an aeroelastic effect: while the ﬂow affects the body motion, the body
motion in turn affects the ﬂow insofar as it produces a synchronization of the vortex-
shedding frequency with the frequency of vibration of the body. Synchronization
occurs in a wide variety of physical, biological, and mathematical non-linear systems,
including clocks attached to the same deformable wall, which tick in unison, women
sleeping in the same room, who according to [8] tend to have their menses on the
same day, and the famous van der Pol equation, among other nonlinear equations. In
the vortex-shedding case the synchronization is referred to as lock-in.
Figure5 shows measurements of the across-ﬂow oscillations of an elastically
supported circular cylinder in smooth ﬂow and their spectral densities, and of ﬂow
velocity ﬂuctuations and their spectral densities at 2.5 diameters downstream of and

one diameter above the cylinder axis [9]. Note the signiﬁcant increase in amplitude
for fs = fn. However, even for fs = fn the ratio of the amplitude to the diameter of
the cylinder remains relatively small. This is typical of vortex-induced oscillations.
Up to a certain magnitude of the displacement the body motion results in a transfer
of energy from the ﬂow to the body. This transfer may be viewed as equivalent to
a ﬂow-induced negative aerodynamic damping. For larger displacements, however,
there occurs a transfer of energy from the body to the ﬂow. This helps to limit the
amplitude of the motion and may be viewed as equivalent to a ﬂow-induced positive
damping.
Figure6 reﬂects another aeroelastic phenomenon of interest in practice: the
increased along-span correlation of the pressures acting on a circular cylinder as
the oscillation amplitudes increase.
1.1.2
Modeling of Vortex-Induced Oscillations
The aeroelastic behavior of an oscillator is described by its equation of motion, in
which the excitation term is the resultant of the ﬂow-induced pressures. As was
mentioned earlier, the latter can in principle be obtained from the solution of the
Navier–Stokes equation with boundary conditions dependent upon the solution itself.
For many years mathematicians and engineers have tried to develop simpliﬁed
empirical models. One justiﬁcation for such models is that the collective behavior of
a wide variety of systems with large numbers of degrees of freedom can be similar to

the behavior of simple low-degree-of-freedom systems representing them. (A ﬂow
interacting with a body is a system with an inﬁnity of degrees of freedom.) The
various empirical vortex-induced oscillation models contain adjustable parameters
ﬁtted to match experimental results. By construction, the solutions of the model
equations with parameters ﬁtted to those results provide a reasonable description
of the observed aeroelastic motions. The user must be aware that the empirical
model may not be valid as a motion predictor for conditions that differ signiﬁcantly
from the experimental conditions in which the ﬁtted parameters were obtained. For
long elastically-supported cylinders in uniform smooth ﬂow we review a number of
two-degree-of-freedom models, and a simpler but useful single-degree-of-freedom
model.
1.1.3
Coupled Two-Degree-of-Freedom Equations: Wake Oscillator
Models
Two-degree-of-freedom models entail two coupled equations, one describing the
body motion, and one describing the wake motion. Various models, all derived from
a generic model, were reviewed by Scanlan [10], whom we follow in the sequel. The
generic model includes the equation of body motion

The constants ai, bi, ci must be identiﬁed by a combination of physical reasoning
and experimental work. The system 1.2–1.5 is autonomous. Various models differ
according to the meaning ascribed to the variable φ and the choice of non-zero
constants a, b, and c.
The ﬁrst wake oscillator model was proposed in 1955 by the great American
mathematician Birkhoff4 [11]. In the Birkhoff model the variable φ is the angle,
denoted by α, between the axis of the vortex street and a ﬁctitious lamellar mass,
“something like the tail of a swimming ﬁsh,” that extends a distance L aft of the
cylinder, and oscillates at the Strouhal frequency from side to side across the wake.
Funakawa [12] pursued Birkhoff’s basic idea by attributing to the wake oscillator a
physical meaning associated with the mass of the “dead ﬂuid” region in the near wake
of the cylinder. He conducted experiments in uniform smooth ﬂow in which a circular
cylinder was subjected to harmonic oscillations at the Strouhal frequency. Details on
the behavior of the “dead ﬂuid” region were inferred from ﬂow visualizations under
lock-in conditions. The wake oscillator was assumed to act as a horizontal pendulum
coupled to the cylinder motion and described by the equation
I ¨α + c ˙α + k(α + ˙y

2ρU 2(2π)L(D + L)/2 is the oscillator’s moment stiffness,
and ¯α = 2y0/(D + L). Equation(1.6) was used by Funakawa to calculate drag and

Poincaré, with whom he had close and fruitful scientiﬁc interactions.

lift forces induced by the wake oscillator on the cylinder through Magnus effects, and
dependent on y, ˙y, and ˙y3. There results from this model a van der Pol-type equation
of motion of the body that contains two terms of aerodynamic origin. The ﬁrst term is
oftheformc1,aero ˙y andreﬂectsthetransmissionofenergyfromtheﬂowintothebody.
Unlike a mechanical damping coefﬁcient—which is associated with loss of energy
by the system,—the aerodynamic damping coefﬁcient c1,aero < 0. The second term
has the form c2,aero ˙y3, where the aerodynamic damping coefﬁcient c2,aero > 0. For
small ˙y the net aerodynamic damping due to the linear and nonlinear terms in ˙y
is negative, so that the displacement increases. For large ˙y the net aerodynamic
damping becomes positive, thereby limiting the amplitude of the body motion. A
critique of Funakawa’s model work led Nakamura [13] to propose a modiﬁed form
of the Magnus lift force. A further modiﬁcation was proposed by Tamura and Matsui
[14].
In another family of circular cylinder vortex-induced oscillation models the
parameter φ of Eq.(1.2) is taken to be the lift coefﬁcient CL. Hartlen and Currie
[15] proposed the following model:
M ¨y + C ˙y + K y = 1
2ρU 2DCL(t)
(1.7)
¨CL −aωs ˙CL + γ
ωs
˙C3
L + ωsCL = b ˙y
(1.8)
where b is an adjustable parameter, α = ρD2/8π2S2M, y = 4α/3CL0, and CL0 is
the measured amplitude of the ﬂuctuating lift coefﬁcient on the stationary cylinder.
Hartlen and Currie’s model was subsequently modiﬁed by Skop [16] and Grifﬁn
[17], Landl [18], Wood [19], and Wood and Parkinson [20].
Dowell [21] developed a model in which CL was also used as the wake oscillator
variable. The model is based on four requirements:
1. At high frequencies a virtual mass relationship is preserved between lift and
cylinder acceleration, that is,
8CL = −B1ρD2 ¨y2
2 (ω →∞)
(1.9)
where B1 is a constant.
2. At low frequencies quasi-steady conditions hold between CL and y, that is, for
∞→0
CL = f ( ˙y
U ) = A1( ˙y
U ) −A3( ˙y
U )3 + · · ·
(1.10)
where A1, A3 . . . are constants.
3. For small CL and y ≡0 the ﬂuid oscillation has the Strouhal frequency, that is,
¨CL + ω2
sCL = 0.

tures of Dowell’s model are that it contains a fourth order coupling of y to CL,
and that the model can describe oscillations in a broader frequency range than
is the case for other models. For details and comparisons with experiments see

1.1.4
Single-Degree-of-Freedom Model of Vortex-Induced Response
The following simple single-degree-of-freedom model proposed by Scanlan [22]
exhibits features of a van der Pol oscillator:

(1.13)
In Eq.(1.13) K = Dω/U, and the circular frequency ω satisﬁes the Strouhal relation
ω = 2π SU/D; Y1, Y2, ϵ, and CL, a measure of the lift force that would occur in
the absence of lock-in, must be ﬁtted to experimental results. This model allows for
negative and positive aerodynamic damping at low and high body displacements,
respectively, that is, for the aeroelastic transfer of energy from the ﬂow to the body
or from the body to the ﬂow according as the displacements are small or large.
At lock-in ω ≈ωn, and Y2(ωn) = 0, CL(ωn) = 0, since the last two terms within
the square bracket of Eq.(1.13) are much smaller than the term—dominant by far—
reﬂecting the aerodynamic damping effects. At steady amplitudes the average energy
dissipation per cycle is zero, so that

The parameters Y1 and ϵ may be evaluated from model tests. At the lock-in velocity
the body is displaced to an initial amplitude A0 > y0 and then released. The body

Galloping
In this section we study two types of galloping. Across-wind galloping is a large-
amplitude oscillation (one to ten or more across-wind dimensions of the body) exhib-
ited in a plane normal to the oncoming ﬂow velocity by slender structures with certain
types of cross-section. For example, ice-laden cables subjected to winds approxi-
mately normal to their span exhibit galloping oscillations in a vertical plane. For
brevity we will refer to across-wind galloping simply as galloping. Wake gallop-
ing refers to oscillations of a downstream cylinder induced by the wake ﬂow of an
upstream cylinder, and has been observed in bundled power transmission-line cables.

Equation of Motion of Galloping Bodies: The Glauert-Den
Hartog Necessary Condition for Galloping instability
Pioneering contributions to the galloping problem are due to Glauert [29] and Den
Hartog [30, 31]. Experience has shown that knowledge of the mean lift and drag
coefﬁcients obtained under static conditions as functions of angle of attack is sufﬁ-
cient for building a satisfactory analytical description of the galloping phenomenon;
that is, galloping is governed primarily by quasi-steady forces. Deviations of the
actual drag and lift forces from their mean static counterparts that occur during the
galloping motion have a second-order effect, unless the oscillator can experience
chaotic transitions, as suggested in Sect.6.1.2.3.
We assume that the problem is two-dimensional, and consider the cross-section of
a prismatic body in smooth ﬂow (Fig.8). Assume the body is ﬁxed and that the angle
of attack of the ﬂow velocity Ur is α. The mean drag (mean force in the direction of
Ur) and the mean lift (mean force in the direction normal to Ur) are, respectively,
D(α) = 1
2U 2
r BCD(α)
(1.25)
L(α) = 1
2U 2
r BCL(α)
(1.26)
Their projection on the direction y is
Fy(α) = −D(α) sin α −L(α) cos α
(1.27)
We write Fy(α) in the alternative form
Fy(α) = 1
2U 2BCFy(α)
(1.28)
where
U = Ur cos α.

It follows from Eqs.(1.27) and (1.28) that
CFy = −[CL(α) + CD(α) tan α] sec α.
(1.30)
We now consider the case in which the same body oscillates in the across-wind
direction y in ﬂow with velocity U (Fig.9).
The magnitude of the relative velocity of the ﬂow with respect to the moving body
is denoted by Ur and can be written as
Ur = (U 2 + ˙y2)

(1.31)
The angle of attack, denoted by α, is
α = arctan ˙y
U .
(1.32)
If the body has mass m per unit length, elastic supports, and linear viscous damp-
ing, its equation of motion is
m[¨y + 2ζωn ˙y + ˙ω2
ny] = Fy
(1.33)
where ζ is the damping ratio, ωn is the circular natural frequency, and Fy is the
aerodynamic force acting on the body. It is assumed that the mean aerodynamic drag
and lift coefﬁcients CD(α) and CL(α) for the oscillating body and for the ﬁxed body
are the same, so Fy(α) is given by Eqs.(1.28)–(1.32).
For incipient motion, where a may be assumed to be small,
α ∼= ˙y

∼= 0,
Fy(α)|α=0 ∼= ∂Fy

If d > 0 the ﬁxed point y = 0, ˙y = 0 is stable, that is, small oscillations from the
position of equilibrium y = 0 due to a small initial deviation from that position will
decay in time, and the body will revert to its position of equilibrium. The body is
then said to be aerodynamically stable. However, if d < 0, the ﬁxed point y = 0,
˙y = 0 is unstable, and the body is said to be aerodynamically unstable.
A necessary condition for the occurrence of galloping motion is then
dCL
dα + CD

0
< 0.
(1.38)
The inequality (1.38) is known as the Glauert-Den Hartog criterion. (A sufﬁcient
condition for the occurrence of galloping is d < 0.) Note, however, that Eq.(1.38)
is applicable to galloping motion that starts from rest; a large triggering disturbance
can in certain instances cause the occurrence of galloping even if Eq.(1.38) is not
satisﬁed.
For reasons of symmetry circular cylinders cannot gallop: since the quasi-static
mean lift force is identically zero for any angle of attack, dCL/dα ≡0. For an
octagonal prism the lift and drag coefﬁcients measured under static conditions are
depicted in Fig.10. It can be seen that for angles of attack −5◦< α < 5◦, where α
is deﬁned in Fig.10, the Glauert-Den Hartog criterion is satisﬁed.
1.2.2
Description of Galloping Motion
In Sect.1.3 we were concerned with obtaining a necessary condition for the occur-
rence of galloping. In this section we consider bodies for which the total aerodynamic
coefﬁcient d < 0, and discuss the evolution in time of their galloping motion.

the identiﬁcation of three basic types of curves CFy as functions of α, and of the
corresponding curves α as functions of the reduced velocity U/Dωn. The observable

in physical experiments. For A1 > 0, if the speed increases from U1 to U2 a jump
occurs from the lower to the upper curve; if the speed decreases from U2 to U0 the
jump occurs from the upper to the lower curve.
The effect upon the galloping of non-uniform deﬂections along the span and of
turbulence in the oncoming ﬂow is discussed in [32]. Turbulence helps to render the
oscillations unsteady and, depending upon its scale and intensity, it can reduce the
magnitude of the aerodynamic damping to a degree that will prevent the occurrence
of galloping. For additional studies of galloping see [35–37].
1.2.3
Chaotic Galloping of Two Elastically Coupled Square Bars
Experiments on a double galloping oscillator consisting of two elastically supported
and coupled square prisms (Fig.12) are described in [38]. The bars were observed to
gallop in phase, but except for relatively low ﬂow speedsU this oscillatory form alter-
nated irregularly with a second oscillatory form wherein the two bars galloped with
higher frequency in opposite phases (Fig.13). The mean time between transitions
from the ﬁrst to the second oscillatory form decreased as the ﬂow speed increased.

A similar simple galloping oscillator is shown in Fig.14. Observations show that
its motion exhibits small deviations from periodicity (Fig.15) that may be attributed
to irregular ﬂow ﬂuctuations in the wake ﬂow and to turbulence caused by exper-
imental appurtenances. It follows that the actual aerodynamic forces acting on the
oscillator deviate from the quasi-static model assumed in Sect.6.1.2.1. Numerical
simulations of the double galloping oscillator in which small random excitations
were superimposed on the quasi-static aerodynamic forces yielded results similar to
the experimental results of Fig.13 [38].
It has been conjectured that galloping motions of the type shown in Fig.13 are
chaotic. The experimental results just reviewed have led to the development of a
theory of chaotic dynamics occurring in a wide class of stochastic systems that can
exhibit transitions between distinct oscillatory forms [39].

galloping that is galloping induced by the wake of the upstream cylinder. Wake
galloping arises in power transmission lines grouped in bundles as for example in
Fig.16. Since it occurs between spacers, it is referred to as subspan galloping.
We noted earlier that circular cylinders cannot experience across-wind galloping
in uniform oncoming ﬂow. However, the ﬂow in the wake of an upstream cylinder is

sheared (i.e., non-uniform). If the distance between the upstream and the downstream
cylinder is a few cylinder diameters, and the downstream cylinder is displaced into
approximately the outer quarter of the wake, a galloping motion will begin from
that displaced position, which grows in amplitude until it reaches a steady state
elliptical orbit—a limit cycle—with the long axis oriented approximately along the
ﬂow velocity. An oscillograph trace of the galloping motion of a downstream cylinder
supported elastically in both the ﬂow direction and the direction normal to the ﬂow
is shown in Fig.17. The direction of the motion on that orbit is downstream near the
outer portion of the wake and upstream near the center of the wake, or clockwise in
Fig.17.
Wake galloping is analyzed by assuming two-dimensionality (i.e., uniform
upstream ﬂow and large ratio of subspan to cylinder diameter). The downstream
cylinder is assumed to be elastically supported in both the horizontal and vertical
direction about a position (X, Y), where X, Y are along-ﬂow and across-ﬂow coor-
dinates centered on the upstream cylinder (Fig.18). The equations of motion of the
downward cylinder are written in terms of its excursions (x, y) away from the posi-
tion (X, Y):

force components in the X and Y direction, written as

where U is the free upstream ﬂow velocity, Uw is the average wake velocity in the

Eq.1.42a were ﬁrst developed in [41, 42]. Cx, Cy are aerodynamic drag and lift
coefﬁcients. They, and their derivatives, are obtained by direct measurements of
time-averaged values in the wind tunnel. The corresponding forces are self-excited:
they vanish if the excursions x, y and their derivatives vanish. Cases of interest have
included smooth circular cylinders and stranded wire cables.
An analytical solution of the problem can be obtained by assuming in Eqs.1.41a
and1.42a
x = x0eλt
(1.43a)
y = y0eλt
(1.43b)
and using the condition that the determinant of the coefﬁcients of Eq.1.41a vanishes.
The motions are unstable if the real part of the eigenvalue λ is smaller than zero.
Stability boundaries can be obtained by seeking the vanishing real part of λ for a
number of points X, Y. The agreement between theory and experiment was found
to be reasonably good (Fig.19) [43]. The corresponding orbits [x(t), y(t)] may be
calculated by using Eqs.1.42a and1.43a. For applications to cables see [40, 44, 45].
1.3
Torsional Divergence
Torsional divergence is an aeroelastic phenomenon that, like galloping, can be
described by using aerodynamic properties measured on the body at rest. It can
occur in bodies with relatively ﬂat shapes, such as airfoils and lifting surfaces (see
Sccts.2.1–2.2) or bridge decks. It is also referred to as lateral buckling, and represents
the condition wherein, given a slight deck twist, the drag load and the self-excited
aerodynamic moment will precipitate a torsional instability.

We illustrate the divergence phenomenon by considering the bridge deck section
of Fig.20, in which U is the horizontal wind velocity, α is the angle of rotation about
the bridge section’s elastic center, and kα is the torsional stiffness. The aerodynamic
moment per unit span may be written as
M(α) = 1
2ρU 2B2CM(α)
(1.44)
where CM(α) is the aerodynamic moment coefﬁcient about the torsional axis and
B is the bridge deck width. Typically CM(α) is a monotonically increasing function
of α. We denote CM(0) by CM0. For small angles α, M(α) may be approximated to
ﬁrst order as
M(α) = 1

1.4
Flutter and Buffeting in the Presence of Aeroelastic
Effects
Flutter is the term applied to aeroelastic phenomena occurring in ﬂexible bodies
with relatively ﬂat shapes in plan (e.g., airfoils, rotor blades, turbomachinery blades,
bridge decks) and involving oscillations with amplitudes that grow in time and can
result in catastrophic structural failure. The term ﬂutter is relatively recent and was
ﬁrst introduced in an aeronautical context; note that in Fig.6.1 ﬂutter is referred to as
“undulation.” As late as 1971 it has also been used to designate the wake galloping
of conductor cables [42, 44], a usage that now appears to be obsolete. Like other
aeroelastic phenomena, ﬂutter entails the solution of equations of motion involving
inertial, structural damping, restoring, and aerodynamic forces dependent upon the
ambient ﬂow and the shape and motion of the body.
For phenomena of interest in civil engineering the body motion is said to be stable
from a ﬂutter point of view if, assuming the absence of forcing terms, and given a
sufﬁcientlysmalldisturbancefromthebody’spositionofequilibrium,theoscillations
initiated by that disturbance will gradually die out, that is, the body will revert to its
position of equilibrium. In dynamical systems theory that position is referred to as
a stable ﬁxed point (or a sink). In the presence of small forcing, solutions near the
ﬁxed point stay nearby, and the system is referred to as linearly stable. As the ﬂow
velocity increases, the aerodynamic forces acting on the body will also increase, and
for a certain value of the ﬂow velocity, called critical ﬂutter velocity, or simply ﬂutter

306
E. Simiu
velocity, the stable ﬁxed point in the dynamical system representing the body motion
becomes neutrally stable—a center. At that velocity, in the absence of forcing, an
initial small disturbance from equilibrium will result in steady harmonic, rather than
decaying, oscillations. For velocities larger than the critical velocity the center turns
into an unstable ﬁxed point, also known as a source, and the oscillations initiated by
a small disturbance will grow in time. The nonlinear dependence upon the motion
of the aerodynamic forces and/or the body restoring force can result in a dynamical
system in which the oscillations reach a periodic steady state by evolving on a stable
limit cycle. In general, for ﬂow velocities in excess of the critical velocity, the body
will perform unacceptably from a service point of view, or can experience structural
damage or collapse during the growing transient motion, that is, before its motion
reaches a steady state.
The greatest difﬁculty in solving the ﬂutter problem for bridges is the development
of appropriate expressions for the aerodynamic forces due to the bridge deck motion.
For thin airfoil ﬂutter in incompressible ﬂow it has been shown by Theodorsen [46]
that the aerodynamic forces due to small oscillations can be derived from basic
potential ﬂow theory. To date perhaps the most inﬂuential contribution to solving the
bridge ﬂutter problem is a simple conceptual framework developed by Scanlan, who
noted that the aerodynamic forces due to relatively small bridge deck oscillations can
be characterized by fundamental quantities—aerodynamic derivatives or transforms
thereof—obtained from measurements performed on the oscillating, rather than the
ﬁxed, body [47].
Computational ﬂuid dynamics approaches currently being developed rest on the
same basic idea. For some bridge decks it is possible to perform numerical compu-
tations of the motion-dependent aerodynamic forces, at least for smooth oncoming
ﬂow [48]. The latter restriction is not trivial, since turbulence, like the Reynolds
number, can affect the aerodynamics and therefore aeroelastic behavior.
Althoughﬂutterisaccompaniedatalltimesbysheddingofvorticeswithfrequency
equal to the ﬂutter frequency, it is a phenomenon distinct from vortex-induced oscilla-
tion. The latter entails aeroelastic ﬂow-structure interactions only for ﬂow velocities
at which the vortex-shedding frequency is close or equal to the structure’s natural
frequency. For velocities higher than those at which lock-in occurs the oscillations
are signiﬁcantly weaker than at lock-in (see Sect.2.1). In contrast, for velocities
higher than the critical ﬂutter velocity the strength of ﬂutter oscillations increases
monotonically with ﬂow velocity. As was pointed out by Scanlan and Billah [49],
the statement made in some physics textbooks that the ﬂutter of the original Tacoma
Narrows bridge was a vortex-induced resonant oscillation conﬂates two distinct phe-
nomena, and is therefore incorrect.
In Sect.6.1.4.1 we consider the case of two-dimensional bridge deck behavior in
smooth ﬂow. Section6.1.4.2 is concerned, in a two-dimensional context, with bridge
deck ﬂutter and buffeting in the presence of aeroelastic phenomena.

1.4.1
Formulation and Analytical Solution of the Two- Dimensional
Bridge Flutter Problem in Smooth Flow
The equations of motion of a thin airfoil with linear restoring forces are written as
m ¨h + S ¨α + ch ˙h + Chh = Lh
(1.49a)
S ˙h + I ¨α + cα ˙α + Cαα = Mα
(1.49b)
where h and α are the displacement due to vertical bending and the torsional angle,
respectively. A unit span is acted upon by the aerodynamic lift Lh and moment Mα,
and has mass m, mass moment of inertia I, static imbalance S (equal to m times the
distance a between the center of mass and the elastic center), vertical and torsional
restoring forces characterized by the stiffness Ch and Cα, respectively, and viscous
damping coefﬁcients ch and cα. Theodorsen showed that for small oscillations the
expressions for Lh and Mα are linear in h and α and their ﬁrst and second derivatives
[46]. The coefﬁcients in these expressions are referred to as aerodynamic coefﬁcients
or, more commonly, ﬂutter derivatives, and are functions of the reduced frequency
bω/U, where b is the half-chord of the airfoil, ω denotes circular frequency, and U
is the smooth ﬂow velocity.
Bridge decks are typically symmetrical, so the distance a and the imbalance S
are zero. Scanlan and Tomko proposed expressions applicable to small oscillations
that, like Theodorsen’s expressions, are linear in h and α and their ﬁrst and sec-
ond derivatives [47]. However, as was noted earlier, the ﬂutter derivatives must be
obtained from laboratory measurements (or, if possible, by using computational ﬂuid
dynamics to solve the Navier–Stokes equation numerically). Tests showed that, just
as for airfoils, the ﬂutter derivatives are functions of the reduced frequency. In bridge
engineering the reduced frequency is customarily deﬁned as Bω/U, where B is the
whole width of the deck (unlike in aeronautical engineering, in which the half-chord
is used), and U is the mean wind ﬂow velocity; in addition, it is customary to write
the expressions for the lift and moment in terms of real parameters and variables,
rather than complex ones, as is common in aeronautical engineering. If the horizontal
displacement p is also taken into account—which was not done in Scanlan’s original
formulation—the equations of motion of a two-dimensional section of a symmetrical
bridge deck with linear viscous damping and restoring forces in smooth ﬂow can be
written as
m ¨h + ch ˙h + Chh = Lh
I ¨α + cα ˙α + Cαα = Mα
m ¨p + cp ˙p + C p p = Dp
(1.49c)
where h, α, and p are the displacement due to vertical bending, torsion, and horizontal
bending, respectively. A unit span is acted upon by the aerodynamic lift Lh, moment
Mα, and drag Dp, respectively, has mass m, mass moment of inertia I, vertical,
torsional and horizontal restoring forces with stiffness Ch, Cα, and C p, respectively,
and viscous damping coefﬁcients ch, cα, and cp. The expressions for the aeroelastic

forces, including those induced by the horizontal bridge deck displacements p, are

Equations(1.50a)–(1.50c) do not explicitly include terms in ¨h, ¨α and ¨p (i.e., added
mass terms) which are negligible in wind engineering applications; however, they
include terms in h and p whose function is to account for changes in the frequency
of vibration of the body due to aeroelastic effects. Since these terms are out of phase
with their ﬁrst derivatives but in phase with added mass terms, the latter are in practice
absorbed in the terms in h and p. The quantities α, ˙h/U and B ˙α/U are effective
angles of attack and are therefore nondimensional, as are the coefﬁcients H ∗
i , A∗
i and
P∗
i , to which the designation “ﬂutter derivatives” or “Scanlan derivatives” is usually
applied. Each term in Eqs.(1.50a)–(1.50c) can be viewed as similar in form to terms
of the type
L = 1
2ρU 2BCL = 1
2ρU 2B dCL
dα α
(1.51)
for small angle of attack α. Terms such as K H ∗
i and K 2 A∗
i are thus analogous to lift
coefﬁcient derivatives dCL/dα. These terms are motional aerodynamic derivatives,
which go over into steady-state aerodynamic derivatives such as dCL/dα for K →0
(zero frequency), meaning that they are obtained for the oscillating body, rather than
under static conditions. The terms K H ∗
i , K 2 A∗
i , and so forth, could be denoted by
single symbols. Also, the asterisks could be omitted from the coefﬁcients H ∗
i and
A∗
i . However, for historical reasons the notation that has gained currency is that of
Eqs.(1.50a)–(1.50c). There is no fundamental reason why this could not change, as
was suggested for example by Starossek, an advocate of complex, as opposed to real,
notation [50]. The perception by some bridge engineers that real notation is more
intuitive and transparent undoubtedly accounts for its current wider acceptance.
If plots of the ﬂutter derivatives H ∗
i , A∗
i and P∗
i are available from measurements
as functions of reduced frequency K, the solution of the ﬂutter equations can be
obtained as follows. It is assumed that the expressions for h, α and p are proportional
to eiωt. These expressions are inserted in the equations of motion
m ¨h + ch ˙h + Chh = Lh
(1.52a)

309
I ¨α + cα ˙α + Cαα = Mα
(1.52b)
m ¨p + cp ˙p + C p p = Dp
(1.52c)
The determinant of the amplitudes of h, α, and p is then set to zero. For each value
of K a complex equation in ω is obtained. For the lowest value of K denoted by Kc
the corresponding equation yields a real (or nearly real) solution denoted by ωc. The
ﬂutter velocity is
Uc = Bωc
Kc
.
(1.53)
In Eqs.(1.50a)–(1.50c) the terms containing ﬁrst derivatives of the displacements
are measures of the aerodynamic damping. If, among these terms, only those asso-
ciated with the coefﬁcients H ∗
1 , A∗
2, and P∗
1 are signiﬁcant, the total (structural plus
aerodynamic) damping can be written as

for the vertical, torsional, and horizontal degree of freedom, respectively. For the
airfoil case horizontal displacements are negligible, and H ∗
1 and A∗
2 are both negative
for all K [6, 46]. The total damping is therefore positive for both h and α. It follows
that, in incompressible ﬂow, the airfoil is not capable of experiencing ﬂutter in a
single—vertical or torsional—mode. The mechanism for the occurrence of ﬂutter in
airfoils therefore always involves coupling between the vertical and torsional modes.
However,underthetwo-dimensionalityassumption,anddependinguponthecoef-
ﬁcients H ∗
1 and A∗
2, such coupling is not always involved in the ﬂutter of bridge decks.
The original Tacoma Narrows bridge, which collapsed in November 1940, had neg-
ligible H ∗
1 values for all K, meaning that ﬂutter in the vertical degree of freedom
was not possible. However, A∗
2 was positive for K > 0.16 or so. Assuming that the
effect of horizontal deck motions was negligible, it is easy to see that, for sufﬁciently
high ﬂow velocity, the total damping given by Eq.(1.54b) is negative, and ﬂutter
involving only the torsional degree of freedom would occur. Torsional ﬂutter has in
fact occurred (Fig.6.2) in wind with mean velocity of about 20m/s. The bridge’s sus-
ceptibility to ﬂutter was due to the use of a section with an “H” shape (the horizontal
line in the “H” representing the deck, and the vertical lines representing the girders
supporting it). Owing to its inherent instability this type of bridge section should no
longer be used.

E. Simiu
An alternative approach to the assessment of a bridge’s stability with respect to
ﬂutter involves aerodynamic indicial functions of a bridge deck section, representing
the aerodynamic response of the section to a step change in angle of attack. These
functions are derivable from the aerodynamic derivatives. Under the assumption that
linear superposition is permissible they allow estimates of transient response. For
basic material concerning aerodynamic indicial functions as applied to bridge decks
see [51].
1.4.2
Bridge Section Response to Excitation by Turbulent Wind in the
Presence of Aeroelastic Effects
The aerodynamic forces induced on a bridge by turbulent wind are due to
1. Aeroelastic forces associated with ﬂutter derivatives
2. Vortex-induced forces
3. Randomly ﬂuctuating forces induced by turbulent ﬂow (buffeting forces).
The expressions for the aeroelastic forces have the same form as for the smooth
ﬂow case [Eqs.(1.50a)–(1.50c)]. However, the aerodynamic coefﬁcients H ∗
i , A∗
i , P∗
i
should be obtained from measurements in turbulent ﬂow, since turbulence may affect
the aerodynamics of the bridge deck by changing the conﬁguration of the separation
layersandthepositionofreattachmentpoints.AsasimpleexampleweshowinFig.21

and turbulent ﬂow. Nearer the body the turbulence transports particles with higher

momentum from the outer ﬂow, thus bringing the separation layers closer to the body
and causing reattachment of the ﬂow. This change affects the aerodynamic response;
in this particular example the turbulence results in a decreased drag force. Through
more complex aerodynamic mechanisms, turbulence can affect the ﬂutter derivatives
and, therefore, the ﬂutter velocity—in many instances favorably but possibly also
unfavorably. Vortex-induced forces may be neglected unless lock-in occurs. The
buffeting forces per unit span may be written as follows:

(1.55c)
For example, Eq.(1.55c) is derived from the expression for the total (mean plus

D = ¯D + Db = 1
2ρCD B[U + u(t)]2,
(1.56a)
U is the mean ﬂow velocity, u(t) is the horizontal component of the turbulent velocity
ﬂuctuation at time t, the mean drag force is deﬁned as
¯D = 1
2ρCD BU 2,
(1.57a)
and the drag coefﬁcient CD is measured under turbulent ﬂow conditions. For the two-
dimensional case the solution of the buffeting problem in the presence of aeroelastic
effects is obtained from Eqs.(1.52a)–(1.52c) in which the right-hand sides consist
of the sums Lh + Lb, Mα + Mb, Dp + Db, respectively. However, even though the
two-dimensional case can in some instances provide useful insights into the behav-
ior of a bridge, to be useful in applications to actual bridges the solution must be
obtained for the three-dimensional case where the bridge deformation and the aero-
dynamic forces are functions of position along the span. Such a solution is presented
in Sect.6.2.1.4.

Applications
2.1
Suspension-Span Bridges
This section is devoted to practical methods and results applicable to bridge design
for wind. Section6.2.1.1 is a brief overview of current wind tunnel testing methods.
It includes examples of mean drag, lift, and moment coefﬁcients measured on a
ﬁxed section model for various angles of inclination of the deck with respect to the
horizontal, and examples of ﬂutter derivatives obtained from an oscillating section
model. Section6.2.1.2 discusses the three-dimensional torsional divergence analysis
of a full bridge. Section 6.2.1.3 is concerned with bridge response to vortex shedding.
Section6.2.1.4 is devoted to the ﬂutter and buffeting analysis of a full-span bridge.
Section6.2.1.5 discusses factors that affect, and methods used to enhance, stability
against ﬂutter. Cables in cable-stayed bridges can exhibit severe vibrations due to
the combined action of wind and rain. The excitation mechanism of the dynamic
wind-water-cable interaction is discussed in [52]. The vibrations can be reduced by
using various types of vibration mitigation devices, or by the mechanical processing
of the cable surfaces (e.g., the creation on those surfaces of dimples or various
protuberances) to prevent the formation of water rivulets on the cables [52–57].
2.1.1
Wind Tunnel Testing of Suspended-Span Bridges
Three types of wind tunnel tests are commonly used for suspended-span bridges:
1. Tests on models of the full bridge. Usual model scales are about 1:300–1:500.
An example is shown in Fig.22.
2. Three-dimensional partial bridge models. The supports for such partial models
may consist of taut wires, and the tests are usually designed to mimic motion in
the fundamental vibration mode of the bridge.
3. Tests on section models. Such tests are relatively inexpensive and yield basic
information usable in parametric studies. They afford more ﬂexibility than tests
on models of the full bridge, which may be used to verify results of analyses
based on section model tests. Also, they can be conducted in conventional wind
tunnels at relatively large model scales (1:50 or even 1:25), thus allowing a better
modeling of possibly important details and reducing possible distortions due to
Reynolds number effects (Fig.23).
Such distortions can be signiﬁcant. Figure24a, b show results of tests conducted
in smooth ﬂow in the high-pressure wind tunnel at Göttingen on a section model of
the bridge over the Great Belt, Denmark [58]. It may be surmised that the presence
of turbulence in the oncoming ﬂow—which was not simulated in the high-pressure
wind tunnel—would reduce those distortions by entraining ﬂuid particles with higher
momentumfromtheouterﬂowintotheseparationregion,thusbringingtheseparation
layers of Fig.24a closer to those of Fig.24b. It was concluded in [58] that the drag

Aeroelasticity in Civil Engineering

University, and M. Kitagawa, Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Authority, Tokyo)
coefﬁcient obtained at the lower Reynolds numbers typical of conventional wind
tunnels was in this case conservative for bridge design. From measurements reported
for a series of deck shapes it was stated in [59] that, for those shapes, results obtained
in conventional wind tunnel tests were conservative from the overall point of view of
bridge design for wind. Whether or not such statements can be made in more general
terms is not clear at this time.

Laboratory, University of Western Ontario)
The information sought in section model tests consists of mean drag, lift, and
moment coefﬁcients measured under static conditions as functions of angle α, and of
ﬂutter derivatives. For some bridge decks ﬂutter derivatives obtained under turbulent
wind conditions yield higher critical ﬂutter velocities than their smooth ﬂow coun-
terparts (e.g., [60]), but there are instances where this is not the case. For example,
based on section model tests, the prototype ﬂutter velocity for the renovated Lion’s
Gate Bridge was the same, to within about 2%, for both smooth and turbulent ﬂow
[61]. For important bridges it is prudent to perform tests under low or no turbulence
conditions and under standard turbulence conditions.
For a section model of the New Burrard Inlet Crossing measured mean drag, lift,
and moment coefﬁcients plotted against the angle α are shown in Fig.25 [62]. For a
study of the Golden Gate Bridge measured ﬂutter derivatives at a 0◦mean angle of
attack (angle of inclination between the mean position of the deck and the horizontal)
are shown in Figs.26 and 27 [6, 63]. Flutter derivatives measured at a 5◦mean angle
of attack are shown in Fig.28 [63].
Measurements of ﬂutter derivatives can be made with the section model being
subjectedtoforcedoscillations,orwiththesectionmodelundergoingfreeoscillations
[63]. Note that for an adequate modeling of the ﬂutter of very long bridges (e.g., the
Akashi-Kaikyo bridge, whose main span is 1,990m long) all 18 ﬂutter derivatives
[see Eqs.(1.50a)–(1.50c)] are needed in the calculations [79].

Torsional Divergence Analysis for a Full Bridge
A linear torsional divergence analysis requires knowledge of the moment coefﬁcient
CM(α) measured under static conditions and of the torsional ﬂexibility matrix CT ,
whose elements ci j represent the torsional angles αi at x = xi induced by a unit
torsional moment acting at x = x j. Let the torsional moments acting at x = x j be
denoted by M j. We de/note by {α} and {M}, respectively, the column vectors of the
torsional angles αi and of the moments
M j = 1
2ρU 2B2L jCM(αJ)

where L j is the length of the span element associated with x j, and CM(α j) is the
moment coefﬁcient corresponding to the angle α j. The following matrix equation
holds:

In Eq.(2.2) the variables are torsional angles along the span. The velocity Uc for

The largest eigenvalue of Eq.(2.7) yields the critical torsional divergence velocity
through Eq.(2.4).
Note that if the moment induced by the mean wind speed is negative (i.e., if the
bridge deck subjected to the action of the mean wind speed twists so that the wind
approaches the upper side of the deck), according to the linear analysis torsional
divergence will not occur. The case of the nonlinear dependence of CM upon α can
be dealt with by solving Eq.(2.2) in which CM is expressed in terms of a power series
in α.
2.1.3
Locked-In Vortex-Induced Response
Bridge decks supported by open trusses usually do not experience vortex-induced
oscillations, owing to the shredding of the vorticity by the truss members. However,

Aeroelasticity in Civil Engineering
319
vortex-induced response can be a problem for bluff bridge decks with a box or open-
box shape. Aerodynamic design can help to reduce signiﬁcantly or even eliminate
this problem, as is seen in Fig.29 [69], which shows the measured amplitudes of
vortex-induced deﬂections for alternative shapes of the bridge section. The largest
deﬂections occurred for the open-box section. A closed box fared better, possibly
owing to its greater stiffness, rather than for aerodynamic reasons. However, the
provision of fairings is advantageous from an aerodynamic viewpoint, as is, more
generally, the extent to which the bridge section is streamlined. Flow visualizations
showed that added fairings are effective in streamlining the ﬂow when the deck
is in a twisted position. This can be seen in Fig.30b in which, owing in part to
Fig. 29 Vertical amplitudes of vortex-induced deﬂections for various bridge deck sections of the
proposed Long Creek’s bridge [65] (courtesy of the National Aeronautical Establishment, National
Research Council of Canada)

those fairings, the turbulence zone above the upper part of the deck is considerably
smaller than for the section shown in Fig.30a. For the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark
vortex-induced response suppression was achieved with remarkable effectiveness by
appending guide vanes to the bridge [70]. The steady-state amplitude h0 of the vortex-
induced response may be calculated by using Eq.(1.20), in which we substitute the
notation K H ∗

(2.10)
where φ(x) is the dimensionless mode with frequency ωn that responds to the locked-
in vortex shedding, and the corresponding generalized coordinate is
ξ(t) = ξ0 cos ωht.
(2.11)
Inserting h from Eq.(2.10) into (2.9) and multiplying the result by Bφ(x), the
motion of a segment of length dx associated with the spanwise coordinate x is
described by the equation
m(x)B2 φ2(x)[¨ξ(t) + 2ζωh ˙ξ(t) + ω2

(2.12)
in which we introduced a function f (x) to account for the spanwise loss of
coherence of the vortex-related forces. It is suggested in [6] that it may be appropriate
to model the function f (x) by the mode shape φ(x), normalized to unit value at its
maximum ordinate. For example, if φ(x) is a half-sinusoid over a span l, it would
be assumed
f (x) = sin πx/l.

B = 11.9 m, ρ = 1.23 kg/m3, m = 4250 kg/m,

K= Bω/U = 3.13,U = 15.7 m/s, H ∗
1 = 1.19, ϵ = 4170 [6]. Inserting these val-
ues into Eq.(2.16), and remembering that C2 = 0.42 and C4 = 0.34, we obtain
ξ0 = 0.03. Equation(2.10) yields a peak-to-peak amplitude 2ξ0B = 0.71m. This
is reasonably consistent with observations at the site, according to which for the
mode of the type considered in our calculations the double amplitude did not exceed
0.9m.
According to [75], the vortex-induced response of a bridge in ﬂow with low-
frequency ﬂuctuations is smaller than would be the case in smooth ﬂow; this is
attributed to the weakening effect on the vorticity shed in the bridge’s wake of
phase differences between the low-frequency ﬂow ﬂuctuations on the one hand and
the bridge oscillations on the other. Wind tunnels tend to reproduce atmospheric
turbulence scales inadequately. Therefore low-frequency ﬂow ﬂuctuations tend also
to be reproduced inadequately, as are the inhibiting effects of those ﬂuctuations on the
vortex-induced oscillations. The latter may therefore be overestimated by laboratory
test results.
2.1.4
Flutter and Buffeting of a Full-Span Bridge
In this section we extend to a full bridge the methods developed in Sect.6.1.4.2 for the
two-dimensional analysis of ﬂutter and buffeting for bridge sections. We assume that
the deformations are small so that the behavior of the bridge and of the aeroelastic
and buffeting forces is linear.
Let h(x, t), p(x, t), and α(x, t) denote, respectively, the vertical, horizontal
(sway), and torsional (twist) displacements of the spanwise station deﬁned by the

The aerodynamic coefﬁcients and derivatives in Eqs.(2.21a)–(2.21c) should be based
on measurements performed in turbulent ﬂow, unless the ﬂow is assumed to be
smooth, in which case there is no buffeting by oncoming ﬂow turbulence. Effects
of turbulence created by the ﬂow-structure interaction (signature turbulence) are
assumed to be negligible. This assumption needs to be veriﬁed, and may not be
acceptable (for example in the case of Fig.30a). Effects of vortices shed in the wake
of the deck may be assumed to be negligible unless the ﬂow speed being considered
is close to the speeds associated with lock-in.
The multimodal system of equations of motion of the bridge can be written in
matrix notation:
Iξ ′′ + Aξ ′ + Bξ = Qb(s)

where ξ is the generalized coordinate vector, s = Ut/B, and I is an identity matrix. A
and B are the damping and stiffness matrices of the system, respectively, and include
terms associated with both structural and aerodynamic damping and stiffness. Qb is
the generalized buffeting force vector. The terms of the matrices A, B, and Qb are

The coordinate x indexes information on the deck cross-section (which may vary
along the span) and the mean angle of attack induced by the mean ﬂow speed. For each
vibration mode that angle of attack varies along the span. The ﬂutter derivatives are
therefore included under the integral sign [as in Eq.(2.24)] even if the cross-section
of the deck is uniform along the span. Expressions of the type (2.24) imply that the
aeroelastic forces are perfectly correlated along the span. This is not truly the case,
but some measurements suggest that the error inherent in this assumption is small
[76]. The equations of motion obtained by taking into account only diagonal terms
(i = j) in the matrices A and B represent the single-degree-of-freedom, uncoupled

The ﬂutter condition is identiﬁed by solving the eigenvalue problem

Equation (2.28) has nontrivial solutions if the real and imaginary parts of the deter-
minant of E vanish. The solutions of interest are sought as follows. For a ﬁxed value
of K seek the value of ω in the frequency range of interest until the real part of the
determinant of E vanishes. Repeat the process for successive values of K until both
the real part and the imaginary part of the determinant of E vanish for the same value
of ω. That value of ω is the ﬂutter frequency. The ﬂutter speed is equal to ωB/K,
where K has the value that yielded the ﬂutter frequency ω. For a multi-modal prob-
lem the same procedure must be carried out a number of times equal to the number
of modes. The largest solution of K corresponds to the critical ﬂutter condition. The
mode corresponding to that solution is the dominant mode in the ﬂutter condition.
The eigenvector ξ yields the shape of the ﬂutter oscillatory motion, that is, the rela-
tive participation in the ﬂutter motion of each vibration mode [Eqs.(2.17a)–(2.17c)].
Note that in the linear formulation just described the ﬂutter condition is independent
of the buffeting excitation.

density of the vertical wind speed ﬂuctuations w at xA and xB, Cuw(xA, xB, K) is
the co-spectrum of u at xA and w at xB. It is assumed in Eq.(2.36) that the quadra-
ture spectrum of u and w is negligible. Aerodynamic admittances are assumed to
be equal to unity; in other words the dependence upon frequency of the relation
between wind speed ﬂuctuations and the ﬂuctuating forces they induce is neglected.
This may lead to a slight but likely negligible overestimation of the response. The

length is z0 = 0.003–0.01m, say. If the bridge span is over ground, rather than

over water, z0 depends upon the terrain roughness, see, e.g., [6]. If topographic
effects are signiﬁcant, models such as Eqs.(2.43a)–(2.43c) and (2.44) may not be
appropriate, and micrometeorological measurements should be performed (see, e.g.,
[78]). However it should be kept in mind that measurements conducted at low wind
speeds, at which stable or unstable stratiﬁcation effects could be signiﬁcant, may
not be representative of conditions occurring at the relatively high speeds for which
aeroelastic and buffeting responses are signiﬁcant.
To perform and validate calculations pertaining to a full bridge model tested in
the wind tunnel it is necessary to use turbulence models consistent with the mea-
sured properties of the wind tunnel ﬂow [78, 79]. It is noted in [76] that the large
uncertainties associated with the spatial structure of low-frequency turbulence result
in similarly large uncertainties in the estimation of buffeting response to which low-
frequency vibration modes contribute signiﬁcantly.
Details of the implementation of the ﬂutter and buffeting analysis based on
Eq.(2.26) are reported for the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge (1,990m main span) in [84].
One conclusion of the Akashi-Kaikyo ﬂutter analyses was that disregarding cross-
modal effects (off-diagonal terms in the matrix E) yielded incorrect estimates of the
ﬂutter velocity. This conclusion was veriﬁed by observations on the full-scale model
of the bridge. For a full model of the Straits of Messina Bridge calculations and wind
tunnel measurements are reported in [80].
Analyses can be conducted by taking into account the buffeting response not only
of the deck, but also that of a dynamic model of the entire bridge, including the
cables and the bridge towers. Buffeting response calculations indicated that, for the
Tsing Ma bridge in Hong Kong (1,377m main span), the effect of including the cable
and tower dynamics in the modeling was relatively small [109]. However, the longer
the bridge, the more the effect of the tower dynamics becomes signiﬁcant from an
aeroelastic point of view. For example, according to calculations for a three-span
bridge with a 3,000m main span and 1,500m side spans, replacing ﬂexible steel
pylons by stiffer, reinforced concrete pylons resulted in an increase of the critical
ﬂutter speed of about 25%, while for a bridge with a 2,000m main span and 1,000m
side spans the increase was about 10% [81]. For the latter bridge replacing cables
with allowable stress of about 1,000MPa or less by cables with allowable stress of
about 1,200MPa or more (and a correspondingly lower moment of inertia) resulted
in a decrease of the critical ﬂutter speed of about 25%.
A case study: The Golden Gate Bridge
The Golden Gate bridge has a 1,280m center span and two 343m side spans. The
elevation of the deck above water is 67m. The calculated vibration modes, the modal
frequencies, and the modal integrals (Eqs.2.14) are given in Table1 for the ﬁrst eleven
modes, ranked by order of increasing frequencies. Static force coefﬁcients are listed
in Table2. A surface roughness length of 0.009m was used in the calculations. The
ﬂutter derivatives were assumed to be independent of position along the span. How-
ever, the ﬂutter velocities were calculated for ﬁve distinct sets of ﬂutter derivatives,
corresponding to −5◦, −2.5◦, 0◦, 2.5◦, and 5◦mean angles of attack. Figures26, 27

i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) obtained in smooth ﬂow
from a 1:50 section model of the Golden Gate bridge for a zero-degree mean angle

i , A∗
i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), and P∗

(given by Eq.2.30) were accounted for in the calculations.
Buffeting calculations were carried out using ﬂutter derivatives for the bridge at
0◦mean angle of attack under a 22.2m/s mean velocity. The largest values along the
deck calculated for 2 % modal damping ratios and a mean wind speed of 34m/s at
the deck elevation were σhh = 0.31m and σαα = 0.77 × 10−3 rad. Smaller assumed
damping ratios would result in larger buffeting response (Tables1 and 2).
For ﬂutter calculations it was assumed that the damping ratios were 0.5 %. Calcu-
lations showed that, under the assumptions used, no ﬂutter occurred for combinations
including only the ﬁrst six modes. Inclusion of the seventh mode, and of the seventh
and eighth modes, yielded the reduced frequencies K, the circular frequencies ω,
and the critical ﬂutter velocities Uc listed in Table3 for each of the ﬁve mean angles
of attack. If a 1 % modal damping was assumed in the calculations, the multimodal
ﬂutter analysis yielded a ﬂutter velocity of 44.6m/s, rather than 22.0m/s, as was the
case for the assumption of a 0.5 % modal damping.
In addition to a multimodal analysis, a single-mode analysis was performed. Mode
7 yielded the lowest ﬂutter velocity in all cases. The single-mode ﬂutter velocities
obtained were almost identical to those obtained by a multimodal analysis based on
a combination of seven modes. This result, as well as the calculated shape of the

oscillatory ﬂutter motion, suggests that the ﬂutter is dominated by mode 7, which is
the ﬁrst torsional asymmetric mode (i.e., the type of mode in which the ﬂutter of the
Tacoma Narrows bridge occurred—see Fig.6.2).
In addition to section model tests in smooth ﬂow, tests in ﬂow with turbulence
intensities 7.4 and 11 % were conducted for a 1:150 scale model of half the central
span. Depending upon turbulence intensity, mean ﬂutter velocities were about 10–
20% higher than the ﬂutter velocity for smooth ﬂow conditions [69, 83] (Table3).
Before concluding this section we mention the development in [110] of a time
domain approach for full bridges. The approach uses aerodynamic impulse response
functions obtained from ﬂutter derivatives by Fourier transformation. Unlike calcu-
lations in the frequency domain, which assume that the aeroelastic forces depend
upon the mean deformation of the bridge, the time domain calculations use models
of the aeroelastic forces that depend upon the instantaneous deformation induced by
the buffeting. A numerical example included in [110] indicates that, for a 2,000m
span bridge with speciﬁed aeroelastic properties, the effect of this reﬁnement on the
ﬂutter velocity and the buffeting response was relatively small.
We also refer the reader to research on the behavior of suspended-span bridges
during construction [84–86], and on the effects of winds skewed with respect to the
direction normal to the bridge span [69, 83].
2.1.5
Reduction of Bridge Susceptibility to Flutter
It has already been noted that “H-section” decks are prone to ﬂutter. This is due both to
their weak torsional stiffness and to their unfavorable aerodynamic properties. Road-
ways with slots, vents, or grills can signiﬁcantly improve aeroelastic performance
[91]. Even minor details such as deck railings can affect structural performance [92].
The design of long bridges to achieve satisfactory performance economically
requires efﬁcient aeroelastic design both through the selection of cross-sectional deck
shapes with favorable ﬂow patterns, and through aeroelastically effective structural
design resulting in a reduction of modal and cross-modal integrals [see Eqs.(2.23a)–
(2.23c) and (2.24)], particularly for torsional motions. Modal shapes consistent with
such reduction can be achieved through the selection of a favorable ratio of side
spans to main span, cross-sections stiffer near the supports and along the side spans
than in the central part of the main span, stiff pylon towers, and stiff cables. For the

deck shape. From [71]
Akashi-Kiokyo Bridge the decks were of equal width throughout the bridge but had
torsionally stronger and more bluff shapes near the supports and along the side spans
(Fig.31). The spindle-type suspension bridge concept depicted in Fig.32 is aimed at
achieving similar features more elegantly [92].
As an example of the role of aerodynamic reﬁnements we brieﬂy consider the
“π-section” deck (Fig.33). It was found that a ratio C/D′ = 2.0 was optimal aero-
dynamically [73] (C = deck ﬂoor overhang, D′ = girder depth). In addition the
aeroelastic performance depends on the ratio r of solid trafﬁc barrier height to outer
Fig. 32 Spindle-type suspension bridge concept. From [72]

pedestrian trafﬁc strip width. For θ = tan−1r = 30◦the torsional aerodynamic damp-
ing was found to be almost negligible in comparison with the case θ = 90◦[93]. For
this value of θ ﬂow separation patterns result in aeroelastically beneﬁcial reductions
of unsteady pressures on the upper surface of the deck. It would be of interest to
determine whether the reductions observed in the wind tunnel are Reynolds-number
independent.
According to tests and calculations reported in [74], the slotted box girder shown
in Fig.34 is effective aerodynamically, as well as being efﬁcient structurally, for a
hypothetical suspension bridge with a 2,800m main span and 1,100m side spans.
For a similar study of a suspension bridge with 2,500m main span and 1,250m side
spans, with a deck consisting of a two-box girder over the mid-1,230m of the central
span and a box girder over the rest of the bridge, see [96].

number, and T is a sufﬁciently long time interval. If (2.45) is equated to the product
−2mζaωn, where ζα denotes the aerodynamic damping ratio, we may deﬁne a total
damping ratio

If ηrms = λ, then ζa = 0. The response, including the effects of the aeroelastic forces,
is obtained simply by substituting the total damping ratio ζt for the structural damp-
ing ratio ζ in the homogeneous equation of motion of the body. If ηrms < λ, then
ζa < 0, and the body extracts energy from the ﬂow, that is, it can experience self-
excited oscillations. If ηrms > λ, then ζa > 0, and the body experiences no destabi-
lizing aeroelastic effects. The approximate validity of the approach just described
was veriﬁed against wind tunnel measurements of chimney response conducted at
Reynolds numbers Re ≈600, 000 [97]. For reinforced concrete chimneys [98] sug-
gests λ ≈0.4.
It may be inferred from some measurements conducted in smooth ﬂow that the
largest value of the aerodynamic coefﬁcient Kα0, denoted by Kα0 max, is of the order
of unity (about 1.0 for Re ≤104, about 1.4 for 104 < Re < 105, and about 0.8 for

Re ≥105—see [98]). Ratios Kα0/Kα0 max proposed in [98] as functions of the ratio
U/Ucr and of turbulence intensity are shown in Fig.(35). More elaborate models
of Kα0, applicable to chimneys with non-negligible end effects, are proposed in
[98]; see also [6]. For response involving more than one mode of vibration [97]
proposes, for each mode, expressions for the total damping similar to Eq.(2.48). In

336
E. Simiu
these expressions modal aerodynamic damping ratios are derived by assuming that
aeroelastic effects are linearly superposable.
The calculation of the total response of a chimney or stack to wind loading requires
information or assumptions on the drag coefﬁcient, Strouhal number, spectral den-
sity of the lift coefﬁcient, spanwise wind loading correlation parameter, and aeroe-
lastic parameter Kα0. The aerodynamic and aeroelastic information depends upon
Reynolds number, chimney surface roughness, chimney aspect ratio and taper, and
terrain roughness. For details see [6, 98, 99].
To reduce the vortex-induced response chimneys may be provided with hydraulic
dampers or tuned mass dampers [100], or with aerodynamic devices referred to as
spoilers. The latter are aimed at reducing or destroying the shed vortices’ coherence
along the height. A spoiler commonly used in the past for steel stacks with very light
damping was developed on the basis of wind tunnel tests. It consists of three thin
helical strakes applied over the top 33–40 % of the chimney (Fig.35) [6, 101]. The
strakes in use are rectangular in cross-section, with a height of 0.1–0.13 diameters,
and a pitch of one revolution in 5 diameters. They increase signiﬁcantly the drag
force acting on the stacks. According to full-scale observations reported in [102],
for large vibration amplitudes (e.g., 3–5 % of the diameter) the vortices re-establish
themselves and the strakes become ineffective. An alternative type of spoiler device
is a perforated shroud placed over the top 25 % of the stack [6, 103].
2.2.2
Tall Buildings
The response of tall (high-rise) buildings to wind loading may be divided into three
categories:
• along-wind response, which consists of (a) the static response induced by the
mean ﬂow speed, and (b) the dynamic (buffeting) response induced mainly by
longitudinal turbulent ﬂuctuations in the oncoming ﬂow (contributions by along-
wind components of the signature turbulence, that is, of ﬂow ﬂuctuations due to
the ﬂow-structure interaction, are typically small)
• across-wind response due to signature turbulence, including vorticity shed in the
building wake (contributions by lateral turbulent ﬂuctuations in the oncoming ﬂow
are typically small)
• torsional response, due to the non-zero distance between the building’s elastic
center and the instantaneous point of application of the resultant wind loading.
This terminology pertains to the case where the mean wind speed is parallel to a
principal axis of the building’s horizontal cross section.
For isolated buildings in horizontal terrain with speciﬁed roughness simple pro-
cedures are available for relating the along-wind response to the oncoming turbulent
ﬂow (see, e.g., [6]). Expressions based on ﬁrst principles are not available, how-
ever, for the estimation of the across-wind and torsional response. Nevertheless,
some tentative empirical criteria have been developed from wind tunnel measure-
ments. Let hrms denote the rms value of the across-wind oscillations at the top of

Aeroelasticity in Civil Engineering
337
the building. According to those criteria aeroelastic effects become signiﬁcant if
hrms > hrms cr, where hrms cr is a critical value. For buildings with a square shape
in plan experiments reported in [104, 105] suggest that, if B denotes the side of
the horizontal cross-section, it is conservative to assume hrms cr/B = 0.015 for open
terrain, hrms cr/B = 0.025 for suburban terrain and, under the assumption that no
neighboring building affects signiﬁcantly the turbulent wind ﬁeld, hrms cr/B = 0.045
for centers of cities. For a variety of shapes tentative, crude empirical expressions
and attendant data are available to describe the across-wind and torsional response
for hrms < hrms cr [6, 106]. According to [107], for some building shapes estimates
based on those expressions appear to be signiﬁcantly at variance with results based
on [94].
Figure36 [94] shows results of wind tunnel experiments obtained for four pris-
matic building shapes in smooth ﬂow, ﬂow over open terrain, and ﬂow over urban
terrain. Results for each case are given for three values of the structural damping
ratio. The model scale was estimated to be about 1/600, and for all models the height
H, the sectional area BD, and the speciﬁc mass were 0.5m, 0.0025m2, and 120kg/
m3, respectively. In Fig.36, f0,U, and hrms denote, respectively, natural frequency
of vibration in the fundamental mode, wind speed at building top, and rms of across-
wind response at the building top. Additional results are reported in [108] for winds
acting from various directions on the models described in [94] and on a model with
a triangular shape in plan.
For tall buildings higher vibration modes typically do not make major contribu-
tions to the total response. In engineering practice information provided by sources
such as [94, 104–108] is seldom if at all used for design purposes. Rather, each
important tall structure is subjected to an ad-hoc aeroelastic wind tunnel test that
reproduces the structure’s main mechanical characteristics and built environment
and allows testing for a sufﬁcient number of wind speeds and directions. Recently,
however, efforts have been made to develop for tall buildings an approach similar to
the approach used for suspended-span bridges. Those efforts are still in the incipient
stage. They entail primarily measurements used to estimate aerodynamic damping.
For a tall building with a depth-to-width ratio of 2, H/(BD)
1
2 = 5, and a linear
fundamental modal shape, measurements of wind forces induced by across-wind
harmonic forcing as well as by torsional harmonic forcing in smooth and turbulent
ﬂows were reported in [94], the wind direction being parallel to the long dimen-
sion of the rectangle. As is the case for chimneys (Eq.2.47), the total damping ratio
may be written as a sum of structural damping and aerodynamic damping. For ﬂow
over suburban terrain and for four values of the structural damping, Fig.37 shows,
for various structural across-wind and torsional damping ratios, denoted by hsx and
hsθ, nondimensional across-wind and torsional rms responses based on direct wind
tunnel measurements and on analyses in which the measured aerodynamic damping
ratios were used. In Fig.37 UH denotes the mean velocity at elevation H, B is the
short dimension of the horizontal cross-section of the building, and nx, nθ denote the
across-wind and torsional natural frequencies. Similar studies conducted on models
with ratios D/B = 1 and D/B = 3 are reported in [111]. The framework developed
in [95, 111] provides a useful basic understanding of aeroelastic effects on tall build-

serve as a substitute for individual, ad-hoc wind tunnel tests, the more so as lock-in
or galloping effects not accounted for in [95, 111] can play an important role in the
response for reduced velocities larger than 5 or so [108].

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
David A. Peters
Abstract Rotorcraft have particularly complex and often nonlinear aeroelastic phe-
nomena. This chapter deals with those challenges including ground resonance, air
resonance and various forms of aeromechanical instabilities.
In this chapter we will examine a number of aeroelastic phenomena associated with
helicopters and other rotor or propeller driven aircraft. Certain areas have been
selected for treatment to illustrate some signiﬁcant stability problems which are
associated with the design of helicopters. The approach to be followed employs sim-
pliﬁed modelling of various problems such that physical insight into the nature of
the phenomena can be obtained. In general, a complete and precise formulation of
many of the problem areas discussed is highly complex and the reader is referred to
the literature for these more detailed formulations.
A basic introduction to the mechanics and aerodynamics of helicopters may be
found in [1, 2]. Extensive reviews of helicopter aeroelasticity may be found in [3,
4]. Reference [4] provides an excellent discussion of the considerations necessary
in modelling helicopter aeroelasticity and illustrates the complexity of a general
formulation as well as the care required to obtain a complete and precise analytical
model.
Helicopter rotors in use may be broadly classiﬁed in four types, semi-articulated
or teetering, fully-articulated, hingeless and bearingless. This classiﬁcation is based
on the manner in which the blades are mechanically connected to the rotor hub. The
teetering rotor is typically a two-bladed rotor with the blades connected together and
attached to the shaft by a pin which allows the two-blade assembly to rotate such
that tips of the blades may freely move up and down with respect to the plane of
rotation (ﬂapping motion). In the fully-articulated rotor, each blade is individually
attached to the hub through two perpendicular hinges allowing rigid motion of the
blade in two directions, out of the plane of rotation (ﬂapping motion) and in the plane
of rotation (lag motion). The third type is the hingeless rotor in which the rotor blade

is a cantilever beam, but with soft ﬂexures near the root, simulating hinges. Fourth,
bearingless rotors further replace the pitch bearing by the softness in torsion of the
root of the blade. Thus, pitch changes are introduced through torsional deformations.
Because of their greater ﬂexibility, elastic deformations of hingeless and bearing-
less rotors are signiﬁcant in the analysis of the dynamics of the vehicle. Bending out
of the plane of rotation is referred to as ﬂap bending and in-plane as lag bending.
These three rotor conﬁgurations are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Rotation of the
blade about its long axis is controlled by a pitch change mechanism suitably con-
nected to the pilot’s stick. For further details see [1] for articulated rotors and [5] for
hingeless rotors. Other variations in rotor hub geometry are found such as the gim-
balled rotor described in [6]. We will concentrate our discussion on the aeroelastic
behavior of fully-articulated and hingeless rotors. However, it is important to realize
that, for the aeroelastic analysis of rotors, the precise details of the hub and blade
geometry must be carefully modelled.
Phenomena in helicopter aeroelasticity may be classiﬁed by the degrees-of-
freedom which are signiﬁcantly coupled. Typically, the dynamics of a single blade are
of interest although coupling among blades can be present through the elasticity of
the blade pitch control system or the aerodynamic wake [7]. The degrees-of-freedom
of a single blade include rigid body motion in the case of the articulated system as
well as elastic motion. Elastic motions of interest include bending in two directions
and twisting or torsion. These elastic deformations are coupled in general. In addition
to individual blade aeroelastic problems, the blade degrees-of-freedom can couple
with the rigid body degrees-of-freedom of the fuselage in ﬂight as well as the elastic
deformations of the fuselage [8–10] or with the fuselage/landing gear system on the
ground [10]. In fact, a complete aeroelastic model of the helicopter typically involves
a dynamic model with a large number of degrees-of-freedom. We do not propose to
examine these very complex models, but rather will consider simple formulations of
certain signiﬁcant stability problems which will give some insight into the importance
of aeroelasticity in helicopter design. Avoiding resonances is also of considerable
signiﬁcance, but is not discussed here. First, aeroelastic phenomena associated with
an individual blade are described and then those associated with blade/body coupling
are examined. Finally, we will consider phenomena associated with the dynamics of
the wake.

Blade Dynamics
Classical ﬂutter and divergence of a rotor blade involving coupling of ﬂap bending
and torsion have not been particularly signiﬁcant due to the fact that, in the past, rotor
blades have been designed with their elastic axis, aerodynamic center, and center of
mass coincident at the quarter chord.
In addition, blades are often torsionally stiff (a typical torsional frequency of a
modern rotor blade is about 5–8 per revolution) which minimizes coupling between
elastic ﬂap bending and torsion. It is important to note that torsional stiffness con-

trol system ﬂexibility is included as well as blade ﬂexibility. Rotor systems with
low torsional stiffness [11] have experienced ﬂutter problems; and on hingeless and
bearingless rotors, the blade section center of mass and elastic axis position can be
moved from the quarter chord to provide a favorable effect on the overall ﬂight sta-
bility [12] which may mean that these classical phenomena will have to be reviewed
more carefully in the future. Sweep has also been employed on rotor blades [13]
and this couples ﬂap bending with torsion. However, we will not consider ﬂutter
and divergence here, but will instead concentrate on phenomena more frequently
encountered in practice. Further discussion of classical bending-torsion ﬂutter and
divergence of rotor blade may be found in [3, 14].
1.1
Articulated, Rigid Blade Motion
In order to introduce the nature of rotor blade motion we ﬁrst develop the equations
of motion for the ﬂapping and lagging of a fully articulated blade assuming that the
blade is rigid. Consider a single blade which has only a ﬂapping hinge located on
the axis of rotation as shown in Fig. 2. The blade ﬂapping angle is denoted by βs
and the blade rotational speed by . We proceed to derive the equation of motion
of the blade about the ﬂapping axis. We assume that the rotor is in a hovering state
with no translational velocity. It is most convenient to use a Newtonian approach to
this problem. Since the ﬂapping pin is at rest in space, we may write the equation of
motion for the blade as follows [15]
¯˙HP + ¯
B × ¯HP =
 R
0
¯ϒ × d ¯FA
(1.1)
A blade-body axis system denoted by the subscriptB is employed and ¯HP is the
moment of momentum of the blade with respect to the ﬂapping pin. d ¯FA is the
aerodynamic force acting on the blade at the radial station ¯r. The gravity force on
the blade is neglected owing to the comparatively high centripetal acceleration.
Figure 2 also shows the coordinate system and variables involved. The blade is
modelled as a very slender rod, and the body axes are principal axes such that the
inertia characteristics of the blade are
IB ∼= Iy ∼= Iz;
Ix ∼= 0
Therefore
¯H = (IBqB) ¯jB + (IBrB)¯kB
(1.2)
where
¯ = pB¯iB + qB ¯jB + rB ¯kB
(1.3)

Now we must express the angular body rates in terms of the variables of interest in
the problem,  the angular velocity, and βs the ﬂap angle. The angular velocity must
be resolved into the blade axis system by rotation through βs, and then the ﬂapping
velocity ˙βs added.

The ﬁrst term on the left hand side is the angular acceleration of the blade about
the yB axis and the second term is the angular acceleration of the blade about the
zB axis (i.e., in the lag direction), which arises as a result of out-of-plane (ﬂapping)
motion of the blade. The aerodynamic force on the blade element is comprised of
the lift and drag and is formulated from strip theory (usually called blade-element
theory) [1, 2]. Also, see the discussion in Sect. 4 in Chap. ‘Dynamic Aeroelasticity’.
Three-dimensional effects are obtained by including the induced velocity which, for
our purposes, may be calculated by momentum theory [1]. Thus from Fig. 2.

the inplane motion.

then the ﬂapping equation becomes linear.

Fig. 3 Direction of
centrifugal force for ﬂap and
lag motion
The linearized blade ﬂapping equation may be recognized as a second order system
with a natural frequency equal to the rotor angular velocity and a damping ratio
equal to γ/16 which arises from the aerodynamic moment about the ﬂapping pin.
This motion is well damped as γ is between 5 and 15 for typical rotor blades. It is good
that the system is well damped since the aerodynamic inputs characteristically occur
in forward ﬂight at , and thus the blade ﬂapping motion is forced at resonance.
The spring or displacement term can be interpreted as arising from the centrifugal
force [1]. This same stiffening effect will appear in the ﬂexible blade analysis and
will increase the natural frequency as rotational speed is increased.
If the more general case of ﬂapping in forward ﬂight is considered, then the
equation of motion for ﬂapping (1.12) will contain periodic coefﬁcients which can
lead to instabilities [16]. However, the ﬂight speed at which such instabilities occur
is well beyond the performance range of conventional helicopters, unless they have
positive pitch-ﬂap coupling.
Now we include the lag degree-of-freedom to obtain a complete description of
rigid motion of a fully-articulated rotor blade . The complete development of this
two-degree-of-freedom problem is quite lengthy and will not be reproduced here
[17].
Following the approach given above, assuming that the ﬂap angle and lag angle
are small and that the lag hinge and ﬂap hinge are coincident and located a small
distance e (hinge offset) from the axis of rotation as shown in Fig. 3, and further
accounting for the effect of lag velocity on the aerodynamics forces acting on the
blade, the lift is given by
dL = 1

θ −(r ˙βs + υ)
( + ˙ζs)r

(1.14)

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft

where the effect of the small distance e on the aerodynamics is neglected. The lag
angle is deﬁned as positive in the direction of rotor rotation. Care must be taken in
formulating the inertial terms since we have noted above that a term like ˙βs sin(βs)
is of signiﬁcance in the equations of motion, and thus the small angle assumption
must not be made until after the expressions for the acceleration have been obtained.
Rotating by the ﬂap angle ﬁrst and then by the lag angle, the angular rates in the
blade body axis system are given by

We must also account for the fact that the hinge point of the blade is no longer at rest
but is accelerating [15]. Since the hinge point is located at a distance e from the axis
of rotation, the equation of motion, (1.1), must be modiﬁed to read
˙¯HP + ¯B × ¯HP =
 R
0
¯r × d ¯FA + ¯E × MB ¯aP
(1.16)
where ¯aP is the acceleration of the hinge point
¯aP = ¯ × ( ¯ × ¯E) + ˙¯ × ¯E
(1.17)
¯E is the offset distance and MB is the blade mass.
Accounting for all of these factors, and assuming that the ﬂapping and lagging
motion amplitudes are small, the equations of motion for this two-degree-of-freedom
system may be expressed [17, 18] as

These equations describe the coupled ﬂap-lag motion of a rotor blade. A number of
features can be noted. The effect of the blade angular velocity on the lag frequency
is much weaker than on ﬂap frequency. The uncoupled natural frequency in ﬂap
expressed as a fraction of the blade angular velocity is
ωβ

and the coupled frequency in lag is

For a typical hinge offset of ¯e = 0.05, the rigid ﬂap frequency is
ωβ
 = 1.04
and the rigid lag frequency is
ωζ
 = 0.27

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
355
The ﬂap natural frequency is thus somewhat higher than the rotational speed, and
the lag frequency is roughly one-quarter of the rotational speed. This difference is
due to the weaker effect of the restoring moment due to centrifugal force in the lag
direction as indicated in Fig. 3.
The uncoupled lag damping arises primarily from the blade drag and is equal to
DL ≡2 δ
a
γ
8

(1.24)
The lift curve slope of the blade, a, is the order of 6 per radian and the drag coefﬁcient,
δ, is the order of 0.015 giving a physical lag damping which is 0.005 times the ﬂap
damping or characteristically negligible. The damping ratio of the uncoupled lag
motion for a Lock number of 8 is
ζL = 0.009
This low value of aerodynamic damping indicates that structural damping will be of
signiﬁcance in estimating the lag damping. Any coupling between these equations
which reduces the lag damping tends to result in an instability. Equation (1.21) can
be rewritten

where the equilibrium relationship for β0 has been introduced (1.20) with the effect
of hinge offset on coning neglected. It can be shown that the coupling present in this
two-degree-of-freedom system arising from inertial and aerodynamic forces will not
lead to an instability. However, the hinge offset or changes in minor features of the
hub geometry can lead to instability. The equilibrium lag angle is proportional to
rotor torque (Eq. (1.20)); and, consequently, it varies over a wide range from high
power ﬂight to autorotation as a result of the weak centrifugal stiffening. Thus, the
simple pitch link geometry shown in Fig. 4 will produce a pitch change with lag
depending upon the equilibrium lag angle. The blade pitch angle variation with lag
angle can be expressed as

The root locus shown in Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of this geometric coupling,
indicating that the critical case where instability occurs corresponds to the 180◦locus
(θζ is positive). Recall that λ is negative. Thus, if forward lag produces an increase
in pitch, an instability is likely to occur for a soft-inplane rotor. The effect is also
proportional to thrust coefﬁcient indicating that the instability is more likely to occur
as the thrust is increased [18, 19]. Increasing thrust also increases the steady-state lag
angle, hence increasing the geometric coupling for the geometry shown. In general,
this instability tends to be of a rather mild nature, but it has destroyed tail rotors.
Mechanical dampers are often installed about the lag axes for reasons to be discussed
and these also provide additional lag damping and thus can alleviate the instability.
This example serves to illustrate that great care must be taken in the geomet-
ric design of the articulated rotor hub to avoid undesirable couplings and possible
instabilities. We now turn to the elastic hingeless blade.
1.2
Elastic Motion of Hingeless Blades
The dynamics of a single hingeless blade will now be examined. Again we will use
a simpliﬁed analysis which yields the essential features of the dynamic motion, and
the reader is referred to the literature for a more detailed approach. In general, the
ﬂap and lag elastic deformations (as referred to a shaft axis system) are coupled as
a result of the fact that the principal elastic axes of the blade will be inclined with

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
357
Fig. 5 Effect of pitch-lag coupling on ﬂap-lag stability
respect to the shaft due to pitch angle. In fact, the term ﬂexible “blade”, as used here,
includes the hub as well as the blade itself. “Hub” is used to refer to the portion of
the blade structure inboard of the radial location where the pitch change takes place.
The rotation of the blade principal elastic axes with blade pitch will depend upon
the relative stiffness of the hub and the blade. It can be seen physically that, if the
hub is soft in comparison to the blade, then the principal axes of this ﬂexible system
tend to remain ﬁxed as the pitch of the blade is changed. However, if the hub is stiff
and the blade is soft, the principal elastic axes rotate in a 1:1 relationship with blade
pitch. An additional source of elastic coupling between ﬂap and lag deﬂections arises
from the built-in blade twist. A third source of elastic coupling between ﬂap and lag
arises from inclusion of torsion as a degree-of-freedom. For the typical rotor blade
with a high torsional frequency, the effect of torsional ﬂexibility on ﬂap-lag coupling
can be obtained through a quasistatic approximation to the torsional motion. That
is, for a ﬁrst-order estimate, the torsional inertia and damping can be neglected; and
the coupling effects of torsional ﬂexibility can be expressed in terms of geometric
coupling similar in form to the hub geometry effects described in connection with
the fully-articulated rotor. A detailed analysis of the ﬂap-lag-torsion motion of a
hingeless rotor blade may be found in [20, 21], and the complete equations of motion
for elastic bending and torsion of rotor blades may be found in [22].
We now proceed to examine the ﬂap-lag motion of a hingeless rotor blade from
a simpliﬁed viewpoint.

If it is assumed that the rotor blade is untwisted, has zero pitch, and is torsionally
rigid; the natural frequencies of the rotating blade can be expressed in terms of its
mode shapes, φ, and derivatives with respect to radial distance φ′ and φ′′ as [23–25]

the nonrotating natural frequency and the second term gives the effect of centrifugal

expression for ﬂapping frequency is usually referred to as the Southwell coefﬁcient.
Note that the effect of the centrifugal stiffening is considerably weaker in the lag
direction than in the ﬂap direction as would be expected from the previous discussion
of the articulated rotor.

reducing to the results for the rigid blade. For typical blade mass and stiffness dis-
tributions, the Southwell coefﬁcient is of the order of 1.2 [24].
A simpliﬁed model for the elastic rotor blade follows. The elastic blade is mod-
elled as a rigid blade with hinge offset ¯e and two orthogonal springs (Kβ and Kζ)
located at the hinge to represent the ﬂap and lag stiffness characteristics. The natural
frequencies for this model of the blade are

The spring constants Kβ and Kζ can be chosen to match the nonrotating frequencies
of the actual elastic blade, and the offset is chosen to match the Southwell coefﬁcient.
In this way the dependence of frequency on rotor angular velocity is matched. Owing
to the fact that the Southwell coefﬁcient is close to unity (i.e., the equivalent offset,
¯e is small), in many investigations the dependence of the Southwell coefﬁcient on ¯e
is neglected [17] giving

Thus, with this approximation there is no centrifugal stiffening in the lag direction.
We will use this approximation in the analysis which follows. Recall that these
frequencies are assumed to be uncoupled and therefore are deﬁned with respect to
the blade axes. Thus, they will appear coupled in a shaft oriented axis system. In
order to include the effect of hub ﬂexibility in the analysis, the hub (the portion of
the blade system which does not rotate with pitch) is modelled by a second pair of
orthogonal springs which are oriented parallel and perpendicular to the shaft and do
not rotate when the blade pith is changed [17]. These spring constants are denoted
KβH and KζH . The springs representing blade stiffness, ζB, are also located at the

360

Fig. 6 Spring model for elastic blade and hub
root since offset has been neglected. However, this pair of springs rotate with the
blade as pitch is changed. Figure 6 shows the geometry.
This model for the hub and blade gives rise to elastic coupling between ﬂap
and lag motion. Essentially, a mode shape φ = x is being employed to describe
the elastic deﬂection of the blade in both directions such that the aerodynamic and
inertial coupling terms developed for the articulated blade model (Eq. (1.21)) apply
directly to this approximate model of the hingeless blade. The equations of motion
for ﬂap-lag dynamics are therefore

where the difference between these equations of motion and those presented for the
articulated blade (1.21) arise from the terms p, q, and z. p and q are the ratios of the
noncoupled natural frequencies (i.e., those at zero pitch) to the rotor rpm, and z is
the elastic coupling effect. For the spring model described above these terms can be

R is referred to as the elastic coupling parameter. The physical signiﬁcance of this
parameter can be understood by examining the relationship between the rotation of
the principal axes of the blade-hub system, η, and the blade pitch angle, θ, [26]
tan 2η =
R sin 2θ
R cos 2θ + (1 −R)
(1.39)
It can be seen from this expression that if R = 0 the principal axes remain ﬁxed as
blade pitch is changed and consequently there is no elastic coupling. The ﬂap and
lag natural frequencies are
p2 = ¯ω2
β + 1
q2 = ¯ω2
ζ
where ¯ω2
β and ¯ω2
ζ are the dimensionless nonrotating frequencies. This is the case in
which the hub is ﬂexible and the blade is rigid. At the other limit R = 1, Eq. (1.39)
indicates that the principal axes rotate in a 1:1 relationship with the blade pitch
(η = θ). In this case elastic coupling is present, and expressions for the natural
frequencies (1.38) simply represent the fact that, as the blade is rotated through
90◦pitch, the nonrotating frequencies must interchange. In addition to the case
R = 0 where the elastic coupling between ﬂap and lag vanishes, another interesting
case exists in which no elastic coupling is present. This is the case referred to as
matched stiffness, i.e., when the nonrotating frequencies of the blade are equal in
both directions ( ¯ωζ = ¯ωβ). Various advantages accrue from this particular design
choice as will be discussed below.
In principle, the designer has at his or her disposal the selection of the nonrotating
frequencies of the blade. Consider some of the options in this regard. For simplicity,
only the behavior of the rotor at zero pitch is examined. One choice is the matter of
the hub stiffness relative to the blade stiffness which has an important impact on the
ﬂap-lag behavior of the rotor through the parameter R as will be discussed below.
The ﬂap frequency is largely chosen on the basis of the designed helicopter stability
and control characteristics [5, 12]. Since the rotor blade is, in general, a long slender

362
D. A. Peters
member, the ﬂap frequency will tend to be relatively near to the rotor rpm. Typical
ratios of ﬂap frequency to blade angular velocity for hingeless rotor helicopters are
of the order of p = 1.05 −1.15 [25] although at least one helicopter has ﬂown with
a ﬂap frequency ratio of 1.4 [27]. The second major design decision is the choice
of the lag frequency. Characteristically, the nonrotating lag frequency will tend to
be considerably higher than the ﬂap frequency owing to the larger dimensions of
the blade and hub in the chordwise direction compared to the ﬂapwise direction. As
mentioned above, lag hinges are provided on articulated rotors to relieve lag stresses
arising from ﬂapping. Owing to the fact that the ﬂap frequency is only slightly larger
than once per revolution on a typical hingeless blade there will be considerable ﬂap
bending of the rotor blades. In fact, the amplitude of the vertical displacement of
the blade tip on a hingeless blade will be quite similar to the ﬂapping amplitude of
the fully articulated rotor. The relationship between amplitude of tip motion of the
hingeless blade and the ﬂapping amplitude of the articulated blade is given by [28]

Therefore, the inplane forces due to ﬂap bending will cause the signiﬁcant root
stresses on a hingeless rotor. The dependence of these stresses on the selection of lag
frequency can be seen by assuming that the ﬂap and lag bending are loosely coupled
(z = 0). The lag bending amplitude arising from sinusoidal ﬂap bending at one per
rev can be expressed from the Eq. (1.37), neglecting the lag damping, as

(1.40)
The lag bending moment at the blade root, Kζζ, thus varies as q2/(q2 −1) as shown
in Fig. 7. It can be seen that if the lag frequency is selected above one per rev,
large root bending stresses occur. The bending moment is reduced by choosing a lag
frequency well below one per rev. A lag frequency below one per rev incidentally
would be characteristic of a matched stiffness blade. For example, if
p2 = 1.2 = ¯ω2
β + 1
and
¯ω2
ζ = ¯ω2

then
¯ωζ = 0.45
Rotor blades are usually characterized by their lag frequency as soft inplane ( ¯ωζ < 1)
or stiff inplane ( ¯ωζ > 1). Thus, rotor blade lag stresses an be reduced by choosing a

soft inplane blade design and it should be kept in mind in the discussion that follows
that there is a signiﬁcant variation in the root bending stress with lag frequency. In
the following, the inﬂuence of lag frequency on the dynamics of a hingeless blade is
examined. Also it may be noted at this point that in contrast to the articulated rotor, in
which large mechanical motion in lag allows mechanical lag dampers to be effective,
this is usually more difﬁcult with the hingeless rotor. Nevertheless, hingeless rotor
helicopters have been equipped with lag dampers [10, 29].
Note also that if the lag frequency is selected such that the operating condition of
the rotor is less than one per rev, then resonance in the lag mode will be encountered
as the rotor is run up to operating speed.
Flap-lag stability characteristics as predicted by the equations of motion given by
Eq. (1.37) are now examined. First consider the case in which the hub is considerably
more ﬂexible than the blade (R = 0). In Fig. 8 the stability boundaries given by
Eq. (1.37) are shown as a function of ﬂap and lag frequency and blade pitch angle
for a typical rotor blade. This ﬁgure was obtained by determining the conditions
under which Routh’s discriminant equals zero. It can be seen that an approximately
elliptical region of instability occurs which increases in extent as blade pitch is
increased. It is centered around a lag bending frequency of 1.15 and ﬂap frequency
of 1.15 indicating that, in this particular case, ﬂap-lag instability is more likely
to be a problem for stiff inplane rotors. It can be seen that the stiff inplane blade
(1.1 < ¯ωζ < 1.2) is destabilized with increasing pitch. Figure 9 shows root location
of blade damping versus pitch angle (which relates to thrust coefﬁcient). Clearly, the
instabilities occur at high thrust. A family of plots can be seen for various values wζ.
One can see that the stiff inplane rotors are more likely to be unstable. Figure 10
shows the effect of various ratios of hub stiffness to blade stiffness (different values
of R) indicating the importance of careful modelling of the blade and hub in the

study of ﬂap-lag stability. This theory has been correlated with experiment in [30].
At large pitch angles where the blade encounters stall, wider ranges of instability
occur as shown in [30]. This increase in the region of instability is primarily a result
of the loss in ﬂap damping owing to reduction in blade lift curve slope, a.
Various other conﬁguration details have an impact on the ﬂap-lag stability such
as precone (the inclination of the blade feathering or pitch change axis with respect
to a plane perpendicular to the hub). Precone is usually employed to relieve the root
bending stresses that arise from the steady ﬂap bending moment due to average blade
lift. The blade may also have droop and sweep [21] (the inclinations of the blade axis
with respect to the pitch change axis in the ﬂap and lag directions respectively) which
will also have an impact on the ﬂap-lag stability. The presence of kinematic pitch-
lag coupling will have important effects on hingeless blade stability which depend
strongly on the lag stiffness and the elastic coupling parameter R [17]. Reference [31]
provides a closed-form damping expression with a physical exploration of the effect
of each parameter.
If torsional ﬂexibility is included, elastic coupling between pitch, lag and ﬂap will
exist. This can be most readily understood by extending the simple spring model of
blade ﬂexibility to include a torsion spring. Consider a blade hub system as shown
in Fig. 11 with a ﬂap angle β and a lag angle ζ. Owing to the root spring orientation,
there will be torques exerted about the torsion axis which depend on the respective
stiffnesses in the two directions. Representing the torsional stiffness of the blade and
control system by Kθ, the equation for torsional equilibrium is (neglecting torsional
inertia and damping )
Kθθ = (Kβ −Kζ)βζ
(1.41)

These couplings depend both on the relative stiffness of the blade in the ﬂap and lag
directions and on the equilibrium values of the ﬂap deﬂection and the lag deﬂection.
A matched stiffness blade (Kβ = Kζ) eliminates these couplings which is perhaps the
primary reason for interest in a matched stiffness blade. For typical blade frequencies,
Kζ is larger than Kβ and therefore θζ tends to be negative and θβ positive. θβ is
equivalent to what is usually referred to as a δ3 hinge on an articulated blade. In
powered ﬂight ζ0 is negative (1.20), and the sign of the effect is equivalent to negative
ζ3 [32]. This pitch change arising from ﬂapping is statically destabilizing in the
sense that an upward ﬂapping produces an increase in pitch. If this term becomes
sufﬁciently large, ﬂapping divergence can occur. In autorotation, this coupling would
change sign, as the equilibrium lag angle is positive. The characteristically negative
value of pitch-lag coupling θζ tends to produce a stabilizing effect in most cases
as may be seen from the articulated rotor example. Negative values of θζ can be
destabilizing for a stiff inplane rotor with small values of R [17]. Precone, that is
rotation of the pitch change axis in the ﬂap direction, has a signiﬁcant effect on
the pitch-lag coupling. The coning angle β0, in Eq. (1.43) refers only to the elastic
deﬂection of the blade. Consequently, with perfect precone, that is, when the precone
angle is equal to the equilibrium steady ﬂap angle given by Eq. (1.20), the elastic
deﬂection is zero and the pitch-lag coupling is zero. For excessive precone (i.e., if
the rotor is operated well below its design thrust), β0 is negative and a destabilizing

368

pitch-lag coupling occurs. It should be noted that hub ﬂexibility will also have an
important impact on these kinematic couplings since it will determine the deﬂection
of the pitch change axis. A precise formulation of ﬂap-lag-torsion coupling as well as
furtherdiscussionofitsinﬂuenceonbladestabilitycanbefoundin[12].Comparisons
of theory and experiment can be found in [33].
In summary, a soft-inplane rotor blade tends to be less susceptible to isolated
blade instabilities while the stiff-inplane blade tends to exhibit instabilities along
with a considerably more complex behavior with changes in parameters. Figure 12
contrasts the effect of pitch-lag coupling on these two rotor blade types illustrating
the complexity of the stability boundaries for the stiff inplane case in contrast to the
soft inplane case which is quite similar to the articulated rotor.

Stall Flutter
A single degree-of-freedom instability encountered by helicopter blades which also
occurs in gas turbines is referred to as stall ﬂutter. The reader should consult
Chap. ‘Stall Flutter’ for a discussion of stall ﬂutter on a nonrotating airfoil. Stall ﬂut-
ter is primarily associated with high speed ﬂight and maneuvering of a helicopter and
arises from the fact that stalling of the rotor blade is encountered at various locations
on the rotor disc. For a rotor blade, stall ﬂutter does not constitute a destructive insta-
bility but rather produces a limit cycle behavior owing to the varying aerodynamic
conditions encountered by the blade as it rotates in forward ﬂight.
Consider the aerodynamic conditions existing on a rotor blade in high speed ﬂight.
On the advancing side of the rotor disc, the dynamic pressure depends on the sum
of the translation velocity of the helicopter and the rotational velocity, while on the
retreating side of the disc it depends on the difference between these two velocities.
Consequently, if the rolling moment produced by the rotor is equal to zero, as required
for equilibrium ﬂight, the angle-of-attack of the blade is considerably smaller on the

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
369
Fig. 13 Angle of attack distribution of helicopter rotor at 140 knots (advance ratio = 0.33) [34]
advancing side than on the retreating side. A typical angle-of-attack distribution at
an advance ratio of 0.33 (140 kts) is shown in Fig. 13. This resulting distribution is
produced by a combination of ﬂapping or ﬂap bending motion and the pilot’s control
input.
Note that on the advancing side the angle-of-attack is small and varies compara-
tively slowly with azimuth angle. On the retreating side the angle-of-attack is large
and changes rapidly with azimuth angle. Consequently, prediction of the airload
on the blade requires a model for the aerodynamics of the blade element which
includes unsteady effects both in the potential ﬂow region as well as in the stalled
region. The source of the stall ﬂutter instability is related to the unsteady aerodynamic
characteristics of an airfoil under stalled conditions. Since the stalled region is only
encountered by the blade over a portion of the rotor disc, however, if an instability of
the aerodynamics at stall, it will not give rise to continuing unstable motion since a
short time later the blade element will be at a low angle-of-attack, well below stall.
Owing to the complexity of the ﬂow ﬁeld around a stalled airfoil, we must have
recourse to experimental data in order to determine the unsteady aerodynamic charac-
teristics of an airfoil oscillating a high angle-of-attack. Experimental data are avail-
able in recent years on typical helicopter airfoil sections [34–36], which make it
possible to characterize the aerodynamics of an airfoil oscillating about stall . In
addition, a number of investigations have been conducted which give insight into
the nature and complexity of the aerodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld under stalled conditions
[37–39].
For a simpliﬁed treatment of stall ﬂutter, it is assumed that the blade motion
can be adequately described by a model involving only the blade torsional degree-
of-freedom. The inﬂuence of ﬂapping or heave motion of the section is neglected
such that θ = α. The equation of motion for this single degree-of-freedom system is

where aerodynamic strip theory analysis is employed. Since the aerodynamic damp-

The left hand side of Eq. (2.2) expresses the change in energy over one cycle which
is produced by the dependence of aerodynamic pitching moment on angle-of-attack
rate as given by the right hand side. Figure 14 shows the time history of the pitching
moment and normal force coefﬁcients as a function of angle-of-attack for an airfoil
oscillating at a reduced frequency typical of one per rev motion at three mean angles-
of-attack. The arrows on the ﬁgure denote the direction of change of CN and CM. Note
the large hysteresis loop which occurs in the normal force in the dynamic case when
the mean angle-of-attack is near stall. In the potential ﬂow region the effects are rather
small and are predicted by Theodorsen’s aerodynamic theory (see Chap. ‘Nonsteady
Aerodynamics of Lifting and Non-lifting Surfaces’). Proper representation of the
unsteady lift behavior does have an important bearing on the prediction of rotor

performance, but will not be discussed further. The pitching moment characteristics
are of primary interest here.
The pitching moment is well behaved in the potential ﬂow region, and well above
stall, resulting in small elliptically shaped loops over one cycle. In the vicinity of lift
stall, two interesting effects occur; the average pitching moment increases markedly
in a nose down sense, a phenomenon that is referred to as moment stall [35], and the
moment time history looks like a ﬁgure eight. The change in energy over one cycle
given by Eq. (2.2) is proportional to

CM( ˙α)dα
The value of this integral is qual to the area enclosed by the loop, and its sign is
given by the direction in which the loop is traversed. If the loop is traversed in a
counter clockwise direction, then this integral will have a negative value indicating
that energy is being removed from the structure or that there is positive damping.
Thus the low and high angle-of-attack traces indicate positive damping. Near the
angle-of-attack at which moment stall occurs statically, however, the ﬁgure-eight-
like behavior indicates that there is essentially no net dissipation of energy over a
cycle or possibly that energy is being fed into the structure (the integral on the right
hand side of Eq. (2.2) is positive). This pitching moment characteristic gives rise to
the phenomenon referred to as stall ﬂutter. To actually encounter stall ﬂutter, this
behavior must occur over some appreciable span of the blade [40]. Reference [40]
also discusses the importance of the rate of change of angle-of-attack with time on the
dynamics of this process and concludes that delay in the development of dynamic stall
depending upon ˙α is responsible for stall occurring over a signiﬁcant radius of the
blade with consequent effects on the rotor loads and vibrations. Of course, the rotor
blade only encounters this instability over a small azimuth range and, consequently,
the complete motion is essentially a limit cycle. The loss in damping at stall coupled
with the marked change in the average pitching moment gives rise to large torsional
motion with perhaps 2 or 3 cycles of the torsion excited before being damped by the
low angle-of-attack aerodynamics. A typical time history of blade torsional motion
and angle-of-attack when stall ﬂutter is encountered is shown in Fig. 15. The domi-
nant effect of the occurrence of stall ﬂutter on a helicopter is to give rise to a marked
increase in the vibratory loads in the blade pitch control system [40]. Reference [40]
discusses approximate methods for incorporating unsteady stall aerodynamics into
the rotor blade equations of motion. The most signiﬁcant assumption in the analy-
sis of rotor blade stall ﬂutter relates to the applicability of two-dimensional data on
airfoils oscillating sinusoidally to a highly three-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeld in which the
motions are nonsinusoidal.
Further understanding of the aerodynamics of stall
may make it possible to
design airfoil sections that would minimize the occurrence of stall ﬂutter and the
associated control loads. Blade section design, however, has many constraints owing
to the wide range in aerodynamic conditions encountered in one revolution; and the
aerodynamic phenomena described appear to be characteristic of airfoils oscillating

been formulated to predict dynamic stall [43].

Rotor-Body Coupling
Another important topic is the aeroelastic instability of helicopters associated with
coupling of blade motion and body motion. This problem is of considerable signiﬁ-
cance in articulated and hingeless rotor helicopter design, and was ﬁrst encountered
on autogiros. This violent instability was at ﬁrst attributed to rotor blade ﬂutter until
a theory was developed during the period 1942–1947 showing it to be a new phe-
nomenon. The instability is called ground resonance, and was ﬁrst analyzed and
explained by Coleman [44] who modelled the essential features of the instability
for articulated rotor helicopters. The name ground “resonance” is somewhat confus-
ing since, in fact, the dynamic system of the helicopter and blades is unstable. The
instability occurs at a particular rotor angular velocity; and therefore it appears in
some sense like a resonance, but it is not. Further, the ground enters the problem
owing to the mechanical support provided the helicopter fuselage by the landing
gear. The particularly interesting result obtained by Coleman is that the instability
can be predicted neglecting the rotor aerodynamics; that is, ground resonance is
purely a mechanical instability, the energy source being the rotor angular velocity. In
the discussion below, Coleman’s development is followed. Then there is qualitative
discussion of the more complex formulation of this problem as applied to hingeless
rotors. For an articulated rotor, the aerodynamics tend to be unimportant and only
the lag degree-of-freedom needs to be included. For hingeless rotors, the ﬂapping
degree-of-freedom is important as well and aerodynamic forces play a signiﬁcant role
[10]. The addition of the ﬂapping degrees-of-freedom leads to a similar instability
in ﬂight referred to as air resonance.

Following Coleman’s analysis we consider a simpliﬁed model of a helicopter
resting on the ground. The degrees-of-freedom assumed are: pitch and roll of the
rotor shaft or pylon which arise from the landing gear oleo strut ﬂexibility, and
the lag degree-of-freedom of each rotor blade. Discussion is restricted to the case in
which the rotor has three or more rotor blades and thus has polar symmetry. The two-
bladed rotor is a somewhat more complex problem, and a few remarks on this special
case are made at the end of this section. A four-bladed rotor system is used as the
example since the approach is most easily visualized in this case. The generalization
to three or more blades is described at the end of this section.
Consider the helicopter shown in Fig. 16. The system has six degrees-of-freedom:
the lag motion of each of the four rotor blades and the two pylon deﬂections. Each
rotor blade is modelled as an articulated blade with hinge offset ¯e. A spring is included
at the root since a centering spring may be employed about the lag hinge.
A coordinate system is chosen that is ﬁxed in space in order to allow the sim-
plest mathematical treatment of the asymmetric stiffness and inertia characteristics
associated with pitch and roll motion of the fuselage on the landing gear. If a rotat-
ing coordinate system is employed, then the differential equations describing the
dynamics would involve periodic coefﬁcients with attendant problems in unravel-
ling the solution. In fact, it is this difference in the form of the equations of motion
in ﬁxed and rotating coordinate systems which gives rise to difﬁculties in analyzing
the two-bladed rotor system with asymmetric pylon characteristics. The two-bladed
rotor lacks polar symmetry; and, therefore, a ﬁxed coordinate system approach will
give rise to periodic coefﬁcients from the rotor, while a rotating coordinate system
analysis will give rise to periodic coefﬁcients arising from the asymmetric pylon
characteristics. Thus, periodic coefﬁcients cannot be eliminated in the two-bladed
case unless the pylon frequencies are equal. For a rotor with three or more blades, the
use of a ﬁxed coordinate system allows treatment of asymmetric pylon characteristics
without encountering the problem of solving equations with periodic coefﬁcients.
First we consider the equations of motion describing blade lag dynamics in a
ﬁxed coordinate system to illustrate the inﬂuence of coordinate system motion. All
of our previous examples have used a coordinate system rotating with the blade.
Simpliﬁcation of this problem can be effected by deﬁning new coordinates to describe
the rotor lag motion. These new coordinates are linear combination of the lag motion
of the individual blades. They usually are referred to as multi-blade coordinates [45]
and are deﬁned for a four-bladed rotor as
γ0 = ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3 + ζ4
4
γ1 = ζ1 −ζ3
2
γ2 = ζ2 −ζ4

γ3 = (ζ1 + ζ3) −(ζ2 + ζ4)

The new coordinates, γ1 and γ2, describe the motion of the center of mass of the rotor
system with respect to the axis of rotation and thus are responsible for coupling of
rotor motion to pylon motion, while γ0 and γ3 describe motions of the rotor in which
the center of mass of the rotor system remains on the axis of rotation. If γ1 = γ2 = 0,
then motions corresponding to γ0 and γ3 are such that opposite blades move as though
rigidly attached together with a vertical pin at the root. These motion variables, γ0
and γ3, are uncoupled for the dynamic problem of interest; and, consequently, the
system is reduced to four degrees-of-freedom by introducing these coordinates as
will be shown.
Now the equations of motion for γ1 and γ2 are developed in a moving coordinate
system and then transformed to a stationary coordinate system. With the hub ﬁxed,
the lag motion of each blade without aerodynamics is, as shown earlier,
¨ζi + 2( ¯ω2
ζ)ζi = 0
i = (1, 2, 3, 4)
(3.2)
The natural frequency, ¯ω2
ζ arises from a mechanical spring on the hinge and the offset
or centrifugal stiffening effect and is given by Eq. (1.35). The equations of motion
for γ1 and γ2 are from (3.1) and (3.2)
¨γ1 + 2( ¯ω2
ζ)γ1 = 0
¨γ2 + 2( ¯ω2
ζ)γ2 = 0
(3.3)
These equations may be thought of as describing the motion of the center of mass
of the rotor system in two directions with respect to the coordinate system rotating
at the rotor angular velocity . Resolving to a ﬁxed coordinate system as shown in
Fig. 17,
γ1 = 1 cos t + 2 sin t
γ2 = −1 sin t + 2 cos t
(3.4)
Differentiating and substitution (3.4) into (3.3) we obtain the equations

The second equation appears similar to the ﬁrst with the coefﬁcients of the sine and
cosine terms reversed. Although the variables have been transformed to a ﬁxed sys-
tem, the equations of motion are still referred to a moving frame which accounts for
the presence of the cosine and sine terms. To complete the transformation, multi-
ply the ﬁrst equation by cos(t) and add to the second equation multiplied by sin(t)
to obtain one ﬁxed-axis equation. Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by sin(t) and sub-
tracting from the second multiplied by cos(t) yields the second equation. The two
equations of motion are
¨1 + 2 ˙2 + {2( ¯ω2
ζ −1)}1 = 0
¨2 −2 ˙1 + {2( ¯ω2
ζ −1)}2 = 0
(3.6)
These are the equations of motion for the new lag coordinates (or CM motion) in the
nonrotating coordinate system. Note that the variables are coupled due to the effects
of rotation. The characteristic equation for the dynamics of the lag motion is now
obtained from Eq. (3.6) as
{s2 + 2( ¯ω2
ζ −1)}2 + 42s2 = 0
(3.7)
The roots of this characteristic equation are
s1,2. = ±i( ¯ωζ + 1)
s3,4. = ±i( ¯ωζ −1)
(3.8)
Thus, the coordinate transformation has resulted in natural frequencies in the ﬁxed
coordinate system which are equal to the natural frequencies in the rotating system
given by Eq. (3.3) ( ¯ωζ) plus or minus the rotational speed (the angular velocity of
the coordinate system). This is a basic characteristic of natural frequencies when
calculated in rotating and ﬁxed coordinate systems which must be kept in mind
in analyzing rotating systems. At this point we consider one other aspect of the
dynamics of this type of system which is helpful in visualizing the motion. Consider
the eigenvectors describing the amplitude and phase of the two variables in transient
motion. These ratios are obtained from the equations of motion and the characteristic
roots.

The upper sign corresponds to the upper sign in the roots (3.8).
In either of these characteristic motions, 1 and 2 are of equal amplitude and
1 either leads or lags 2 by 90◦. Thus the transient motion of the rotor system
center of mass is a circular motion. This symmetry which occurs in many rotating
systems permits an elegant formulation using complex coordinates [28, 44]. The
two variables 1 and 2 can be combined into one single complex variable, as will
be discussed below. Further, since the transient motion is circular, these modes are
referred to as whirling modes; and the whirling may be described as either advancing
or regressing depending upon whether the mode of motion corresponds to transient
motion in the direction of rotor rotation or against the direction of rotation. Consider
the root
s1 = +i( ¯ωζ + 1)
corresponding to a counter clockwise rotation of the variables 1 and 2 in Fig. 17.
From the eigenvectors (3.9), we see that 1 leads 2 by 90◦. Thus 1 reaches a maxi-
mum and then 2 reaches a maximum and so the oscillation proceeds in the direction
of rotation and is an advancing mode. Similarly, s2 = −( ¯ωζ + 1), corresponds to
the two vectors rotating in a clockwise direction, but now 1 lags 2 and so this is also
an advancing mode. Hence, the mode with frequency ( ¯ωζ) is an advancing mode.
Following a similar argument for the mode ( ¯ωζ −1) we ﬁnd that it is a regressing
mode, when ¯ωζ is greater than 1. One must be careful of this terminology, since in
a rotating coordinate system modes are also described as advancing and regressing
modes, but because of the change in coordinate system angular velocity, modes may
be regressing in the rotating system and advancing in the stationary system. From
a geometric point of view, there are two whirling modes corresponding to the four
characteristic roots. Use of complex coordinates helps to visualize the direction of
rotation of the modes simply [28].
Thus, the transient motion of the center of mass of the rotor system may be
described in terms of two circular or whirling modes. When viewed in the ﬁxed
frame of reference, one is an advancing whirl (in the same direction as the rotation
of the rotor) and one is a regressing whirl at low rotor angular velocity (ωζ > )
and a slow advancing whirl at larger angular velocities (ωζ < ). Recall that the
frequencies as seen in the rotating frame are simply equal to ±ωζ and one is an
advancing mode while the other is always a regressing mode.
Now the effect of the pylon motion is added. It is assumed that the pylon is
sufﬁciently long and the angular deﬂections are sufﬁciently small such that the hub
motion lies in a horizontal plane. The equations of motion are developed using a
Newtonian approach. First, a single blade is considered; and then the effects of the
other blades are added. It is most convenient to derive the equations with the pylon

or fuselage motion referred to a ﬁxed axis system and the lag angle referred to a
moving axis system and then to transform the lag angle to a ﬁxed coordinate system.
This will illustrate the manner in which periodic coefﬁcients enter the equations. The
equations of motion for the blade ad fuselage system may be written from the free
body diagram shown in Fig. 18, as
¯HB + ¯B × ¯HB = ¯PC M × ¯R
MB ¯aC M = −¯R
˙¯HF = ¯H × ¯R
(3.10)
where ¯R is the reaction force at the hinge, ¯HB is the moment of momentum of the
blade about its center of mass and ¯HF is the moment of momentum of the fuselage
about its center of mass which is assumed ﬁxed in space. ¯B is the angular velocity
of the blade, ¯PC M is the distance from the hinge to the blade center of mass and ¯H
is the height of the rotor hub above the C M. The acceleration of the blade enter of
mass in terms of the acceleration at the hinge point is
¯aC M = ¯aE + ¯B × ( ¯B × ¯PC M) + ˙B × ¯PC M
(3.11)
and the acceleration of the hinge in terms of the acceleration of the hub, ¯a0, and the
rotational velocity of the hub is
¯aE = ¯a0 + ¯ × ( ¯ × ¯e) + ˙¯ × ¯e
(3.12)
The angular velocity of the hub is assumed constant. Three sets of unit vectors are
deﬁned. The subscript B refers to the set of unit vectors ﬁxed to the blade, the subscript
H to the set ﬁxed in the hub and the subscript F refers to a set ﬁxed in space. The lag

We thus see as discussed earlier that γ0 and γ3 are not coupled to the hub motion
and thus do not need to be considered further. Note that the equations of motion for
γ1 and γ2 have periodic coefﬁcients since ψ1 = t. The inﬂuence of the other three
blades must be added to the fuselage equations. The ﬁrst equation becomes

(3.19)
and a similar form is obtained for the other fuselage equation. Using trigonometric
identities and the deﬁnitions of the multi-blade coordinates (3.1) the two fuselage
equations become, retaining only linear terms,
(Iy + 4MBh2) ¨φ =2MBrC Mh{(¨γ1 −2˙γ2 −2γ1) sin ψ1

(3.20)
Again we see that the coordinates γ0 and γ3 do not appear.
These equations involve periodic coefﬁcients. The periodic coefﬁcients are a con-
sequence of deﬁning the lag motion in a rotating system and the fuselage motion
in a ﬁxed system as noted earlier. The periodic coefﬁcients can eliminated by trans-
forming the lag motion to ﬁxed coordinates as described above. This transformation
involves the relationships given by Eq. (3.4). A centering spring about the lag hinge
is incorporated in the lag equations such that the lag frequency is given by

This is equivalent to Eq. (1.35) without the assumption of a uniform blade mass

Note that the periodic coefﬁcients will not be eliminated if we attempt to transform
the body motion into rotating coordinates except in the special case where fuselage
inertias and springs are identical about both axes. The procedure followed above for
four blades will produce identical results for three or more blades. A generalized
description of this procedure may be found in [6].
If the rotor has two blades, the only way to eliminate the periodic coefﬁcients is
to convert the pylon motion to rotating coordinates. Only in the special case of equal
inertia and stiffness will the periodic coefﬁcients be eliminated [44]. In general, if
there is polar symmetry in one frame of reference and a lack of symmetry in the
other frame, expressing the equation of motion in this latter frame will eliminate the
necessity of dealing with periodic coefﬁcients. With a two bladed rotor, the rotor
lacks polar symmetry. If the support system also lacks polar symmetry, the periodic
coefﬁcients cannot be eliminated, and Floquet theory must be employed to analyze
the stability of the system. The simplest case (equal support stiffness) of the two-
bladed rotor is analyzed in the rotating system and the three or more bladed rotor in
the ﬁxed frame. Recall from the previous discussion that this will give quite a different
picture of the variation of system natural frequencies with rpm. For simplicity, only
the multibladed rotor with pylon symmetry is discussed which may be treated in
either reference frame. The pylon characteristics are assumed to be
MFx = MFy = MF
kx = ky = kF
The important parameter governing the coupling between the blade motion and the
fuselage motion is the ratio of the total blade mass to the total system mass deﬁned
by μ,
μ =

MF + 4MB
It is convenient to nondimensionalize the time by the support frequency with the
blade mass concentrated at the hub

F =

since rotor angular velocity is considered to be the variable parameter. The frequen-
cies nondimensionalized in this fashion are denoted by ˆωζ and ˆ. Introducing these
deﬁnitions, Eq. (3.23) becomes,

The stability of the system deﬁned by Eq. (3.24) is examined as a function of the
various physical parameters of the problem. First, consider the limiting case in which
the blade mass is zero (μ = 0). This eliminates the coupling between the fuselage
motion and the blade motion. The natural frequencies of the system are composed
of the uncoupled blade dynamics and the fuselage dynamics. The roots of the char-
acteristic equation are therefore
±i( ˆ + ˆωζ),
±i( ˆ −ˆωζ),
±i,
±i
The latter two pairs correspond to the fuselage motion and the former to the blade
motion. The modes of motion are whirling or circular modes owing to polar sym-
metry. Figure 19 shows the whirling modes, i.e., only the four frequencies with
signs that correspond to the direction of whirling, positive being an advancing mode.
The frequencies are shown as a function of rotor angular velocity. In the numerical
example shown, a centering spring (Kζ) is included such that ˆω = 0.3 when the
rotor is not rotating ( ˆ = 0) and the hinge offset ¯e = 0.05. ( ˆ −ˆωζ) is a regressing
mode when negative, ( ˆ + ˆωζ) is an advancing mode. The fuselage modes (±i) are
advancing and regressing modes respectively. These four whirling modes constitute
the dynamics of the system in the limiting case of no hub mass. For comparison
purposes, if the system is analyzed in the rotating frame, the result will be equivalent
to subtracting the angular velocity ˆ from the frequencies shown in Fig. 19 resulting
in the diagram shown in Fig. 20. Thus, the appearance of the ﬁgure depends upon
the coordinate system. For two bladed rotors, one is likely to see a graph similar to
Fig. 20; while, for multibladed rotor analysis, one usually sees the ﬁxed coordinate
plot shown in Fig. 19. It may be noted that at two rotor angular velocities ( ˆ = 0.65
and ˆ = 1.51) the frequency of one of the blade modes is equal to a pylon mode. It
would be expected that the coupling effects due to blade mass are most signiﬁcant
in these regions.
Next the inﬂuence of the mass ratio μ on the dynamics of the system is examined.
It would be most convenient if root locus techniques could be used. This is not
possible directly with Eq. (3.24) since μ does not appear linearly in the characteristic
equation. Through introduction of complex coordinates, root locus techniques can
be employed [28]. Deﬁne

and the roots of this system are the whirling modes only, i.e.,

i( ˆ −ˆωζ)

The characteristic equation of this system can now be written as

Equation (3.26) is in root locus form with μ as the variable parameter and a zero
degree locus is indicated. The usual root locus rules apply to equations with complex
coefﬁcients as well as to those with real coefﬁcients. Figure 21 shows root loci for
increasing μ for two values of ˆ (0.2 and 1.3) and indicates that the inﬂuence of
μ on the dynamics is quite different depending upon the sign of ( ˆ −ˆωζ)1. When
( ˆ −ˆω) is negative, it can be seen from Fig. 21 that the coupling effect of increasing
μ is to separate the system frequencies. However, when ( ˆ −ˆωζ) is positive, the
two intermediate frequencies come together; and, if μ is sufﬁciently large, instability
occurs. The most critical case occurs at intersection B of Fig. 19 (i.e., when the

Fig. 21 Root locus for increasing blade mass ratio (μ) for two operating conditions
regressing mode frequency ( ˆ −ˆωζ) = 1 such that the two intermediate frequencies
are equal). At this operating condition, any value of μ causes instability. Intersection
A is not critical because of the large separation of the two intermediate frequencies
( ˆ + ˆωζ and ˆ −ˆωζ). In the typical case, for an articulated rotor ˆωζ is the order 1.0
and ˆ at the operating condition ( ˆO P) is the order of 3.0, so that intersection B
occurs below operating rpm. That is
ˆC R = 1 + ˆωζ ≡2
Thus, to completely eliminate the possibility of this instability which is called ground
resonance, one must have ˆC R > ˆωO P = 3, and a very large offset is required since
ˆωζ > 2 and therefore, ¯ωζ = 0.67 which corresponds to a hinge offset of 0.3 (1.35)
without a centering spring. Note that this ratio ˆO P is largely determined by con-
siderations other than rotor stability, such as the rotor operating rpm and the shock
absorbing character of the landing gear. Since this large hinge offset is not practical,
a centering spring may be employed to increase ¯ωζ; however this will increase the
root bending moment, the reason for which the lag hinge was installed.

Fig. 22 Extent of unstable
region for various mass ratios
The unstable region extends below and above this intersection to an extent depend-
ing upon the mass ratio as well as the other geometric parameters. Various criteria
can be found in the literature as to the size of the unstable region as a function of
mass ratio. A typical graph of the frequencies as well as the extent of the unstable
region as a function of μ is shown in Fig. 22 taken from [10]. This result applies to
the case where the pylon has only one degree-of-freedom in contrast to the example
here where the pylon has two degrees-of-freedom.
Next we examine the inﬂuence of mechanical damping on the stability of the
system. Damping in the rotating system (lag damping ) and in the nonrotating system
(pylon damping ) are considered separately. Consider ﬁrst the inﬂuence of damping
on the pylon. This leads to terms CF ˙φ and CF ˙θ in Eq. (3.22). Adding this in complex
form to the second of Eq. (3.25) and expressing the characteristic equation in root
locus form yields
ˆCFs[s2 −2i ˆs + ( ˆω2
ζ −ˆ2)]
(s2 + 1)(s2 −2i ˆs + ( ˆω2
ζ −ˆ2)) −3
8μs4 = −1
(3.27)
where
ˆCF = CFωF
k f h2
This root locus has two zeros at the uncoupled lag-mode frequencies. Figure 23
shows the inﬂuence of increasing damping for two cases. In the ﬁrst, μ is small so
that the basic system is neutrally stable. Adding only ﬁxed axis damping destabilizes
the system. In the second case, where μ is large enough such that the basic system
is unstable, no amount of damping will stabilize the system.
Now consider adding damping to the lag motion of the blades. It must be noted that
this damping will be in the rotating coordinate system (about the blade hinge); and so,
to directly add damping terms to the equations of motion, the rotating frame equations
must be used. The damping then appears as CR ˙γ1 and CR ˙γ2. If the transformations
are followed, this will ultimately result (in the rotating frame with complex notation)
in the damping appearing in the ﬁrst of Eq. (3.25) as

The i ˆ term appears because rotating coordinate system damping is expressed with
respect to a ﬁxed frame. Adding this damping to the ﬁrst of the two equations and

the root locus shown in Fig. 24 is obtained. Again it is interesting to note that adding
damping only in the rotating frame results in destabilizing one of the fuselage modes
when the system is initially neutrally stable (small μ). For large μ the situation is
similar to the ﬁxed axis damping case. These rather surprising effects of damping
in a rotating system indicate that damping must be handled with considerable care.
Owing to the order of the system, it is rather difﬁcult to obtain physical insight
into the source of these effects. A combination of damping in the rotating frame

Fig. 24 Root locus for increasing lag (rotating axis) damping on ground resonance stability
(blades) and stationary frame (pylon) is required to stabilize the system; although,
as can be seen from the root locus sketches, there will always be one zero near to the
fuselage blade lag mode making it difﬁcult to provide a large amount of damping
in one of the modes. There would, of course, generally be damping in the pylons.
Particularly on articulated rotors, blade lag dampers are added since, as noted, this
region of instability must be traversed in bringing the rotor speed to operating rpm.
Reference [44] presents boundaries showing the damping required to eliminate the
instability region for articulated rotor helicopters.
The treatment of more general problems, including the blade ﬂapping degrees of
freedom and discussion of its importance in the hingeless rotor case, may be found
in [8–10]. The two-bladed rotor is treated in [44].
Flapping motion of articulated rotors with small hinge offset does not produce
appreciable hub moments; and, consequently, there is only weak coupling between
the ﬂapping motion and the pylon motion. The hingeless rotor, however, produces
large hub moments; and, consequently, the ﬂapping motion coupled into the pylon

and lag dynamics [10]. Figure 25 shows the inﬂuence of the ﬂapping frequency on
the stability boundaries for μ = 0.1.
There are now three frequencies involved in the problem: the pylon frequency, ωF,
the lag frequency, ˆ −ˆωζ and the ﬂap frequency p (p - 1 in the stationary frame). In
addition to the destructive instability which occurs when the coupled pylon frequency
is equal to the lag frequency ( ˆ −ˆωζ), a mild instability occurs when the coupled
ﬂap frequency is equal to the lag frequency ( ˆ −ˆωζ) as shown by Fig. 26. Note that
pylon and ﬂap frequencies are signiﬁcantly changed by the coupling. The ground
resonance problem for hingeless rotors thus becomes quite complex and difﬁcult to
generalize. The reader is referred to [10] for further details. It may be noted that
a more detailed model of the rotor blades must be employed for hingeless rotors.
Since both ﬂap and lag degrees-of-freedom are involved, it is important to model the

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
391
coupling between these motions, which occurs as a result of hub and blade geometry.
Aerodynamic forces and structural damping are also signiﬁcant.
Air resonance refers to the form this dynamic problem takes with the landing
gear restraint absent, that is, with the vehicle in the air. Coupling of ﬂapping motion,
body motion and lag motion is involved. Fuselage inertia and damping characteristics
can have a signiﬁcant impact on the stability. The air resonance problem is clearly
asymmetrical; and, characteristically, the roll axis is more critical owing to its low
inertia and small aerodynamic damping [8]. Furthermore, air resonance generally
involves the unsteady ﬂow ﬁeld [46].
Since the primary source of damping in this physical system arises from ﬂap
bending, it is possible that the nature of the ﬂight control system can have an impact
on air resonance stability as shown in [47]. Essentially an attitude feedback from the
body to cyclic pitch tends to maintain the rotor in a horizontal plane thus effectively
removing the aerodynamic damping from the ﬂapping/body dynamics. There are also
other indications that the ﬂight control system feedbacks have an impact on rotor
system stability [48]; however, this problem does not appear to be well understood.
Another problem associated with propeller and prop/rotor driven aircraft which
involves a blade motion-support coupling is whirl ﬂutter which has been experienced
on conventional aircraft [49] as well as on V/STOL aircraft [6]. This instability in the
case of the conventional aircraft can be explained by considering only the wing as
ﬂexible (i.e., the propeller blades may be assumed to be rigid). For the tilt prop/rotor
aircraft, where blade ﬂexibility is important, the primary source of the instability is
the same as in the rigid propeller case. It is a result of the aerodynamics characteristics
of propellers and prop rotors at high inﬂows typical of cruising ﬂight. It can be shown
that the source of the whirl ﬂutter instability is primarily associated with the fact that
an angle-of-attack change on a propeller produces a yawing moment, and a sideslip
angle produces a pitching moment. Further, the magnitude of this moment change
grows with the square of the tangent of the inﬂow angle [6] and results in a rapid
onset of the instability.
For the prop/rotor, a complex model with a large number of degrees-of-freedom
is required to predict the dynamics of the system accurately [6]. The whirl ﬂutter
instability can occur on articulated rotors as well as hingeless rotors although for
somewhat different physical reasons [50]. Here inplane force dependence on angular
rate produces unstable damping moments acting on the support. The hingeless rotor
which produces signiﬁcant hub moments is similar to the rigid propeller. Young [51]
has shown by a simpliﬁed analysis that, under certain circumstances, the occurrence
of this instability can be minimized by a suitable selection of the ﬂapping frequency.
Reference [6] contains an excellent discussion of these various problem areas.
A typical predicted variation of damping with ﬂight speed for a tilt-prop-rotor
aircraft is shown in Fig. 27. As mentioned earlier, it is important in modelling this
dynamic system to insure that the structural details of the hub, blade and pitch control
system are precisely modelled. Reference [52] indicates the impact that relatively
small modelling details can have on the ﬂutter speed, as well as describing in detail
the modelling requirements for prop-rotor whirl ﬂutter.

Aeroelastic analysis of two-bladed rotors requires special considerations since the

Unsteady Aerodynamics
Thusfarinthischapter,wehaveutilizedonlythesimplestquasi-steady,blade-element
aerodynamics. However, it is well-known that the unsteady dynamics of the rotor
ﬂow ﬁeld can have a profound effect on rotorcraft. This effect is routinely included in
rotor vibration and performance codes through vortex-lattice waking modelling [55].
However, in rotor aeroelastic computations, which involve eigenvalue computations,
the vortex wake is usually frozen in time. When not frozen in time, the eigenvalue
computation can take hours of computing time [56]. Therefore, more approximate
methods have been developed to include the important effects of wake dynamics in
rotorcraft aeroelasticity. Some of the more useful ones are explained below.

4.1
Dynamic Inﬂow
Amer [57] analyzed the problem of rotor damping in roll and correlated the predicted
data with ﬂight test measurements in hover and forward ﬂight. Amer observes that
a discrepancy in damping is “due primarily to changes in induced velocity which
occur during rolling (or pitching) because of changes in the distribution of thrust
around the rotor disk”. This observation more or less forms the stimulus for most of
the subsequent dynamic inﬂow work. It fell to Sissingh [58], however, to explain this
discrepancy by quantifying Amer’s observation with the inclusion of variable inﬂow
or, more precisely, of changes in induced velocities caused by transient changes in
rotor disk loading. Starting from Glauert’s classical momentum theory postulate, he
gives the formula
k(δλ/λ) = δCT /CT
(4.1)
where k = 2 in hovering and k = 1 in forward ﬂight with V > 40 mph (μ ≪λ). For
transitional ﬂight conditions when induced ﬂow λ cannot be neglected in comparison
to μ, Sissingh suggests an “appropriate” value for k(1 < k < 2) on an ad hoc basis.
It is easily seen that Eq. (4.1) follows from the classical results
λ = −
!
CT /2,
μ = 0
(4.2)
λ = −CT /2μ,
μ ≫λ
(4.3)
Sissingh was probably the ﬁrst to initiate a systematic exposition that established a
relation between instantaneous perturbations (or transients) in thrust δT , and per-
turbations in induced ﬂow, δλ. The induced ﬂow λ is an involved function of both
radius, r, and spatial azimuth position, ψ. To arrive at a tractable model, he uses ﬁrst
harmonic inﬂow and lift distributions, without radial variation,
λ = λo + λs sin ψ + λc cos ψ
(4.4)
Here, λ0 is the uniform inﬂow, while λs and λc are side-to-side and fore-to-aft inﬂow
variations. His analysis convincingly shows that the inclusion of induced velocity
perturbations, as typiﬁed in Eq. (4.4), improves correlation of predicted damping
values with those of the ﬂight test data of Amer. (Sissingh’s distribution has been used
by several other investigators [59–61].) As seen from this equation, the distribution
has two disadvantages. ﬁrst, it neglects the effects of radial variation completely.
Second, it exhibits a discontinuity at r = 0. As a means of improving the inﬂow
distribution to account for radial variation to some degree and to avoid discontinuity,
Peters [62] approximates dynamic inﬂow perturbations in induced ﬂow by a truncated
fourier series with a prescribed radial distribution. The dynamic ﬂow ν is perturbed
with respect to the steady inﬂow λ such that the total inﬂow is
−λ = ¯λ + ν
(4.5)

and dynamic inﬂow is

"

(4.8)
where ¯ν is the part of ¯λ due to thrust (the remainder is due to climb) and 4μ is the
ratio of forward speed to tip speed.
The preceding development from Eq. (4.7) implies that perturbations in disk
loading (δCT , δCL, δCM) create instantaneous perturbations in inﬂow (λ0, λs, λc).
In other words, the feedback between changes in disk loading and inﬂow takes place
without time lag. However, in transient downwash dynamics, a large mass of air
is involved; and it is natural to expect that mass effects will have an inﬂuence on
the complete build up of inﬂow perturbations due to disk-loading perturbations and
vice versa. That is, the feedback will have some form of time delay due to mass
effects. This aspect of the problem was investigated by Carpenter and Fridovich [63]
during the early 1950s. The inclusion of the mass effects forms an integral part of the
development of unsteady inﬂow models as an extension of the quasi-steady inﬂow
treated in the preceding paragraph. Substantial data-correlation experience with the
quasi-steady momentum model clearly demonstrates that unsteady wake effects (not
quasi-steady alone) play a dominant role in hover, in transitional ﬂight, and at low
collective pitch [61, 62]. We will bypass the mathematical details [64] and include
the rate terms, [M], in the quasi-steady equation:

(4.10)
When premultiplied by [L], Eq. (4.10) takes the form

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
395
[τ]{ ˙U} + {U} = [L]{δF}
(4.11)
where [τ] = [L][M]/.
In Eq. (4.11), [r] and [L] have the physical signiﬁcance of time constants and
gains, respectively. The elements of [τ] can also be treated as ﬁlter constants. This
means, unsteady inﬂow can be simulated by passing the quasi-steady inﬂow through
a low-pass ﬁlter.
We now turn to the problem of evaluating these rate (or apparent mass) terms.
This problem has been the subject matter of extensive studies. In [63], apparent mass
terms are identiﬁed in terms of reaction forces (or moments) of an impermeable disk
which undergoes instantaneously acceleration (or rotation) in still air. The problem of
ﬁnding reactions on an impermeable disk basically leads to the solution of a potential
ﬂow problem in terms of elliptic integrals. The values for the apparent mass of air
m A and apparent inertia of air IA are [64]:
m A = 8
3ρR3
and
IA = 16
45ρR5
(4.12)
In other words, these values represent 64 per cent of the mass and 57 percent of the
rotary inertia of a sphere of air or radius R; and we have a diagonal [M] matrix with
m11 = m AρπR3 = 8/(3π)
(4.13)
m22 = m33 = IAρπR5 = 16/(45π)
(4.14)
which give time constants of 0.4244/V for δCT and 0.2264/V for δCL or δCM. Given
the complexity of the actual apparent mass terms of a lifting rotor, it would seem that
the methodology adopted to arrive at the time constants is at best a crude approx-
imation. Surprisingly, tests of Hohenemser et al. [59], and more recent analytical
studies of Pitt and Peters [64] arrive at time constants or mass terms which are within
a few percent of those given by Eq. (4.12). From the symmetry of the ﬂow problem
in hover, it is clearly seen that M is a diagonal matrix with m22 = m33. Therefore,
we have
[M] =

Equation (4.9) with [M] and [L]−1 from Eqs. (4.15) and (4.7) forms the theory
of dynamic inﬂow in hover. Numerous correlations with experimental data have
shown the model accurate and crucial in rotor aeroelastic modelling. This includes
frequency response [59, 62], control derivatives [62], and air and ground resonance
[65]. Figures 28 and 29, taken from [65], show measured and computed frequencies
of a ground-resonance model versus rotor speed. Figure 28 has no dynamic inﬂow
modelling, and Fig. 29 includes modelling of the type of Eq. (4.9). We are particularly
interested in the range 300 <  < 1000 in which ground resonance can occur. The

396

Fig. 28 Inﬂuence of unsteady aerodynamics on hingeless rotor ground resonance. Comparison of
measured modal frequencies, and calculations without dynamic inﬂow
modes, labelled on the basis of theoretical eigenvectors are: regressing inplane (ζR),
regressing ﬂapping (βR), roll (φ), pitch (θ). Note that in Fig. 28, the regressing inplane
mode shows good frequency correlation; but all other modes are signiﬁcantly off of
the correct frequency. In Fig. 29, a new mode appears (due to the added inﬂow degrees
of freedom). It is labelled λ and is a mode dominated by inﬂow motions. The new
results show excellent correlation of all frequencies with the exception of a roll-
pitch coupling for 200 <  < 400. The results show that the regressing ﬂap mode
becomes critically damped at  = 750, and that the measured modes are crucially
impacted by the dynamic inﬂow.
One of the interesting aspects of the dynamic inﬂow theory refers to the for-
mulation of equivalent Lock number and drag coefﬁcient (γ∗and C∗
d) [66]. This
formulation reveals that there is an intrinsic correlation between downwash dynam-
ics and unsteady airfoil aerodynamics. After all, any three-dimensional automatically
includes induced ﬂow theory as a local approximation to transient downwash dynam-
ics. Further,dynamic inﬂow decreases lift and increases proﬁle drag. Therefore, we
should expect an equivalent γ (or γ∗) that is lower than γ, and an equivalent Cd
(or C∗
d) that is higher than Cd. Thus, the γ∗−C∗
d concept leads to one of the sim-
plest methods of crudely accounting for dynamic inﬂow in conventional “no-inﬂow”-

Fig. 29 Inﬂuence of unsteady aerodynamics on hingeless rotor ground resonance. Comparison of
measured modal frequencies, and calculations including dynamic inﬂow
programs. One simply must change γ to γ∗and Cd to C∗
d. Furthermore, the concept
brings out the physics of dynamic inﬂow in a simple and visible manner.
In quasi-steady inﬂow theory, apparent mass effects are neglected. Therefore, the
inﬂow differential equations reduce to algebraic equations without increasing the
system dimension. If we stipulate the condition of axial ﬂow (e.g., μ = 0) in the
quasi-steady formulation, we may obtain γ∗and C∗
d, directly as detailed in [66].

In forward ﬂight, the model of Eq. (4.9) can be used but with alterations to the
[L] matrix. In [64], a general [L] matrix is deﬁned based on potential ﬂow theory.
A new parameter, X, is introduced which is deﬁned as the tangent of one-half of the
wake skew angle. In hover or axial ﬂight, X = tan(0) = 0 and, in edgewise ﬂight, X

398

= tan(π/4) = 1. Thus, S varies from zero to one as we transition from axial ﬂight to
edgewise ﬂight. The corresponding [L] matrix is

(4.18)
In axial ﬂow, X = 0; and this matrix reduces to the momentum-theory values in
Eq. (4.7). In edgewise ﬂow, signiﬁcant couplings develop between thrust and the fore-
to-aft gradient in ﬂow (and between pitch moment and uniform ﬂow). Equation (4.18)
has been proven accurate by exhaustive correlations with forward-ﬂight data [67].
4.2
Frequency Domain
The theory of dynamic inﬂow treats low-frequency inﬂow effects in the range of
0/rev to 2/rev. For high-frequency effects, investigators traditionally have relied upon
frequency-domain aerodynamics such as the Theodorsen function [68]. However, the
wake model for Theodorsen theory is ﬂat two-dimensional for rotor work. A very
useful alternative is Loewy theory [69]. The model for the Loewy theory is similar to
that for the Theodorsen theory except that the wake is assumed to return in an inﬁnite
number of layers spaced apart by a ﬁxed distance, h semi-chords. The resultant lift-
deﬁciency function (the Loewy function) takes the following form
C′(k) =
1
1 + A(k)
(4.19)
A(k) = Y0(k) + i J0(k)(1 + 2W)
J1(k)(1 + 2W) −iY1(k)
(4.20)
W = [exp(kh + 2πiω/Q) −1]−1
(4.21)
where k is the rotating-system reduced frequency, Yn and Jn are Bessel Functions,
ω is the frequency per revolution as seen in the non-rotating system, and Q is the
number of blades.
W is called the wake-spacing function. For inﬁnite wake spacing (h →∞), W →
0;andconsequently,Eq.(4.19)reducestoTheodorsentheory.Forﬁnitewakespacing,
W becomes largest when ω is an integer multiple of Q, and the resulting C′(k) is low.
Thus, lift is lost when the shed vorticity of successive layers is aligned. For small k,
the near-wake approximation for A(k) is [71]
A(k) ≈πk
1
2 + W

(4.22)

Aeroelastic Response of Rotorcraft
399
The above theory has a connection to dynamic inﬂow theory (although the latter
is in the time-domain). In particular, when ω is an integer multiple of Q and k is
small, we can write
A(k) ≈πk
 1
kh

= π
h
(4.23)
Now, if we note that a = 2π for Loewy theory and that h = 4v/σ, where σ =
2bQ/πR (where b = semi-chord). Then
A = σa
8V , C′(k) =
1
1 + σa
8V
(4.24)
which is the quasi-steady approximation for dynamic inﬂow, γ∗/γ.
Thus, C′(k) tends to oscillate between
1
1+σa/8V and 1 (as ω is varied). The lowest
points are at integer multiple of Q, and the highest points are at odd multiples of
Q/2.
An alternative theory for C′(k) is given by Miller [70], which neglects the W in
the denominator of A/(k). Both theories have the same near-wake approximation.
In order to apply a lift deﬁciency function to rotor problems, one must also account
for the effect of C′(k) on lift and drag. This can be accomplished through the C∗
D
approach.

(4.26)
Despite the elegance and power of lift-deﬁciency functions, their use in rotor prob-
lems has been limited by several shortcomings. First, the theories are limited to a two-
dimensional approximation in axial ﬂow. Second, they are in the frequency domain,
which is inconvenient for periodic-coefﬁcient eigen-analysis (although ﬁnite-state
approximations can be obtained) [72]. Third, Loewy theory exhibits a singularity as
ω and k approach zero simultaneously. Due to these drawbacks, investigators often
use dynamic inﬂow for the low-frequency effects (since it is a three-dimensional
neglect wake effects in other frequency ranges.
4.3
Finite-State Wake Modelling
More recently, a complete three-dimensional wake model has been developed that
includes dynamic inﬂow and the Loewy function implicitly [73]. In this theory,
the induced ﬂow on the rotor disk is expressed as an expansion in a Fourier series
(azimuthally) and in special polynomials (radially) in powers of ¯r = r/R.

are proportional to CT , CM, and CL

from any lifting theory. When they are taken from blade element theory (and when
the radial direction is neglected), one can prove that the system of Eqs. (4.29)–(4.30)

Summary
In recent years, rotor aeroelasticity has relied more heavily on unsteady aerodynamic
modelling to improve predictive capabilities. The major modelling tools are dynamic
inﬂow, lift-deﬁciency functions, and ﬁnite-state modelling. The last of these includes
the other two as special cases.

Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines
Fernando Sisto
Abstract Turbomachines also prone to various types of dynamic instabilities and
responses that in some respects are similar to those of classical aeroelasticity as
described in earlier chapters. However the complications of rotating ﬂows and struc-
tures provide new challenges as described in this chapter, also see the related discus-
sion in chapters“Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction and Modern Analysis for
Complex” and “Nonlinear Unsteady Flows in Turbomachinery”.
The advent of the jet engine and the high performance axial-ﬂow compressor toward
the end of World War II focussed attention on certain aeroelastic problems in turbo-
machines.
The concern for very light weight in the aircraft propulsion application, and the
desire to achieve the highest possible isentropic efﬁciency by minimizing parasitic
losses led inevitably to axial-ﬂow compressors with cantilever airfoils of high respect
ratio. Very early in their development history these machines were found to experi-
ence severe vibration of the rotor blades at part speed operation; diagnosis revealed
that these were in fact stall ﬂutter (see chapter“Stall Flutter”) oscillations. The seri-
ousness of the problem was underlined by the fact that the engine operating regime
was more precisely termed the ‘part corrected speed’ condition, and that in addition
to passing through this regime at ground start up, the regime could be reentered dur-
ing high ﬂight speed conditions at low altitude. In either ﬂight condition destructive
behavior of the turbojet engine could not be tolerated.
In retrospect it is probable that ﬂutter had occurred previously in some axial
ﬂow compressors of more robust construction and in the later stages of low pres-
sure axial-ﬂow stream turbines as well. Subsequently a variety of signiﬁcant forced
and self-excited vibration phenomena have been detected and studied in axial-ﬂow
turbomachinery blades.
In 1987 and 1988 two volumes of the AGARD Manual on Aeroelasticity in Tur-
bomachines [1, 2] were published with 22 chapters in all. The sometimes disparate
topics contributed by nineteen different authors and/or co-authors form a detailed
and extensive reference base related to the subject material of the present chapter.

Aeroelastic Environment in Turbomachines
Consider an airfoil or blade in an axial ﬂow turbine or compressor which is running
at some constant rotational speed. For reasons of steady aerodynamic and structural
performance the blade has certain geometric properties deﬁned by its length, root and
tip ﬁxation, possible mechanical attachment to other blades and by the chord, camber,
thickness, stagger and proﬁle shape which are functions of the radial coordinate.
Furthermore, the blade may be constructed in such a manner that the line of centroids
andthelineofshearcentersareneitherradialnorstraight,butaredeﬁnedbyschedules
of axial and tangential coordinates as functions of radius. In fact, in certain cases,
it may not be possible to deﬁne the elastic axis (i.e., the line of shear centers). The
possibility of a built-up sheet metal and spar construction, a laid-up plastic laminate
construction, movable or articulated ﬁxations and/or supplemental damping devices
attached to the blade would complicate the picture even further.
The blade under consideration, which may now be assumed to be completely
deﬁned from a geometrical and kinematical point of view, is capable of deforming1
in an inﬁnite variety of ways depending upon the loading to which it is subjected.
In general, the elastic axis (if such can be deﬁned) will assume some position given
by axial and tangential coordinates which will be continuous functions of the radius
(ﬂapwise and chordwise bending). About this axis a certain schedule of twisting
deformations may occur (deﬁned, say by the angular displacement of a straight
line between leading and trailing edges). Finally, a schedule of plate type bending
deformations may occur as functions of radius and the chordwise coordinate. (Radial
extensions summoned by centrifugal forces may further complicate the situation).
Although divergence is not a signiﬁcant problem in turbomachines, an alternative
static aeroelastic problem, possibly resulting in the measurable untwist and uncamber
of the blades, can have important consequences with respect to the steady perfor-
mance and with respect to the occurrence of blade stall and surge.
One has now to distinguish between steady and oscillatory phenomena. If the
ﬂow through the machine is completely steady in time and there are no mechanical
disturbances affecting the blade through its connections to other parts of the machine,
the blade will assume some deformed position as described above (and as compared
to its manufactured shape) which is also steady in time. This shape or position will
depend on the elastic and structural properties of the blade and upon the steady
aerodynamic and centrifugal loading. (The centrifugal contribution naturally does
not apply to a stator vane.)
1 Deformations are reckoned relative to a steadily rotating coordinate system in the case of a rotor
blade.

Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines

Consider the situation, however, where dynamic disturbances may exist in the
airstream, or may be transmitted through mechanical attachments from other parts o
the structure. Due to the unsteadiness of the aerodynamic and/or the external forces
the blade will assume a series of time-dependent positions. If there is a certain
repetitive nature with time of the displacements relative to the equilibrium position,
the blade is said to be executing vibrations, the term being taken to include those
cases where the amplitude of the time-dependent displacements is either increasing,
decreasing or remaining constant as time progresses.
It is the prediction and control of these vibrations with which the turbomachine
aeroelasticianisconcerned.Oncetheblade isvibratingtheaerodynamicforcesareno
longer a function only of the airstream characteristics and the blade’s angular position
and velocity in the disturbance ﬁeld, but depend in general upon the blade’s vibratory
position, velocity and acceleration as well. There is a strong interaction between the
blade’s time-dependent motion and the time-dependent aerodynamic forces which it
experiences. It is appropriate at this point to note that in certain cases the disturbances
may be exceedingly small, serving only to ‘trigger’ the unsteady motion, and that the
vibration may be sustained or ampliﬁed purely by the interdependence or feedback
between the harmonic variation with time of the blade’s position and the harmonic
variation with time of the aerodynamic forces (the ﬂutter condition).
A further complication is that a blade cannot be considered as an isolated struc-
ture. There exist aerodynamic and possibly structural coupling between neighboring
blades which dictate a modal description of the entire vibrating bladed-disk assem-
bly. Thus an interblade phase angle, σ, is deﬁned and found to play a crucial role in
turbomachine aeroelasticity . Nonuniformities among nominally ‘identical’ blades
in a row, or stage, are found to be extremely important in turbomachine aeroelas-
ticity; stemming from manufacturing and assembly tolerances every blade row is
‘mistuned’ to a certain extent, i.e., the nominally identical blades in fact are not
identical.

The Compressor Performance Map
The axial ﬂow compressor, and its aeroelastic problems, are typical; the other major
important turbomachine variant being the axial ﬂow turbine (gas or steam). In the
compressor the angle of attack of each rotor airfoil at each radius r is compounded
of the tangential velocity of the airfoil section due to rotor rotation and the through
ﬂow velocity as modiﬁed in direction by the upstream stator row. Denoting the axial
component by Vx and the angular velocity by  as in Fig.1, it is clear that the angle
of attack will increase inversely with the ratio φ = Vx/(r). In the compressor, an
increase in angle of attack (or an increase in ‘loading’) results in more work being
done on the ﬂuid and a greater stagnation pressure increment p0 being imparted
to it. Hence the general aspects of the single ‘stage’ (i.e., pair of ﬁxed and moving
blade rows) characteristics in Fig.2 are not without rational explanation. Note that

410
F. Sisto

Fig. 2 Work and pressure ratio relationships
the massﬂow through the stage equals the integral over the ﬂow annulus of the product
of Vx and ﬂuid density.
When the various parameters are expressed in dimensionless terms, and the com-
plete multistage compressor is compounded of a number of states, the overall com-
pressor ‘map’, or graphical representation of multistage characteristics, appears as in

Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines
411
Fig. 3 Compressor map
Fig.3, where ˙m is massﬂow, γ and R are the ratio of speciﬁed heats and gas constant,
respectively; T0 is stagnation temperature and A is a reference ﬂow area in the com-
pressor. Conventionally the constants γ and R are omitted where the identity of the
working ﬂuid is understood (e.g., air). The quantity A is a scaling parameter relating
the absolute massﬂow of geometrically similar machines and is also convention-
ally omitted. The tangential velocity of the rotor blade tip, rtip, is conventionally
replaced by the rotational speed in rpm. The latter omission and replacement are
justiﬁed when discussing a particular compressor.
An important property of the compressor map is the fact that to each point there
corresponds theoretically a unique value for angle of attack (or incidence) at any
reference airfoil section in the compressor. For example, taking a station near the tip
of the ﬁrst rotor blade as a reference, contours of incidence may be superposed on
the map coordinates. In Fig.4 such angle contours have been shown for a speciﬁc
machine. As deﬁned here, ai is the angle between the relative approach velocity W
and the chord of the airfoil. Here again axial velocity Vx (or massﬂow) is seen to dis-
play an inverse variation with respect to angle of attack as a line of constant rotational
speed is traversed. The basic reason such incidence contours can be established is
that the two parameters which locate a point on the map, ˙m√T0/p0 and r/√T0, are
effectively a Mach number in the latter case and a unique function of Mach number
in the former case. Thus the ‘Mach number triangles’ are established which yield
the same ‘angle of attack’ as the velocity triangles to which they are similar, Fig.5.
As a matter for later reference, contours of V/(vω) for a particular stator airfoil,
or else W/(bω) for a particular rotor airfoil, can be superimposed on the same map,
provided the environmental stagnation temperature, T0, is speciﬁed. These contours
are roughly parallel, though not exactly, to the constant rotational speed lines. The
natural frequency of vibration, ω, tends to be constant for a rotor blade at a given
rotational speed; and of course a stator blade’s frequency does not depend directly on
rotation. However, upon viewing the velocity triangles in Fig.5, it is clear that if r

412
F. Sisto

is kept constant and the direction of V is kept constant, the size of W may increase
or decrease as Vx (or massﬂow) is changed. In fact, if the angle between V and W is
initially close to 90 degrees, a not uncommon situation, the change in the magnitude
of W will be minimal. For computing the stator parameter, V/(bω), the direction
of W leaving a rotor is considered to be virtually constant, and the corresponding
changes in V (length and direction) as Vx is varied lead to similar conclusions with
regard to angle of attack and magnitude of V experienced y the following stator. The
values of W/(bω) increase with increasing value of rtip, since the changes in W

(or V ) will dominate the somewhat smaller changes in the appropriate frequency ω,
at least in the ﬁrst few stages of the compressor. Compressibility phenomena, when
they become signiﬁcant will sometimes alter these general conclusions.

Blade Mode Shapes and Materials of Construction
Flutterandvibrationofturbomachinerybladescananddooccurwithawidevarietyof
these beam -like structures and their degrees of end restraint. Rotor blades in use vary
from cantilever with perfect root ﬁxity all the way to a single pinned attachment such
that the blade behaves in bending like a pendulum ‘ﬂying out’ and being maintained
in a more or less radial orientation by the centrifugal (rather than a gravity) ﬁeld.
Stator vanes may be cantilevered from the outer housing or may be attached at both
ends, with degrees of ﬁxity ranging from ‘encastred’ to ‘pinned’.
Thenaturalmodesandfrequenciesoftheseblades,orblade-discsystemswhenthe

If plate-type deformations are signiﬁcant, the beam representation must be replaced
bymoresophisticatedplateorshellelementswhichrecognizestatictwistandvariable
thickness.
In predicting the ﬁrst several natural modes and frequencies of rotor blades it
is essential to take into account the effect of rotor rotational speed. Although the
description is not analytically precise in all respects, the effect of rotational speed
can be approximately described by stating ω2
n = ω2
0n + Kn2 where ω0n is the static
(nonrotating) frequency of the rotor blade and the Southwell coefﬁcient Kn is a pro-
portionality constant for any particular blade in the nth mode. The effect is most pro-
nounced in the natural modes which exhibit predominantly bending displacements;
the modes associated with the two gravest frequencies are usually of this type, and it
is here that the effect is most important. A positive Southwell coefﬁcient represents
a centrifugal stiffening of the blade, increasing the natural frequency. Disk rotation
rate also produces a softening effect that can reduce the Southwell coefﬁcient. This
softening effect is typically signiﬁcant for only the ﬁrst mode. High temperatures
in high pressure turbines operating at high power levels can reduce the modulus of
elasticity of the blades, reducing the static natural frequency ω0n. As high engine
power tends to occur at high rotor speeds, thermal effects can cause the frequency
of some blade modes to decrease with increasing speed. Other factors also need to
be considered, such as blade ﬁxity boundary condition (ﬁxed-ﬁxed in stators versus
ﬁxed-free in rotors), and disk ﬂexibility.
Materials of construction are conventionally aluminum alloys, steel or stainless
steel (high nickel and/or chromium content). However, in recent applications titanium
and later beryllium have become signiﬁcant. In all these examples, considering ﬂutter
or forced vibration in air as the surrounding ﬂuid, the ﬂuid/structural mass ratios are
such that the critical mode and frequency may be taken to be one or a combination
of the modes calculated, or measured, in a vacuum.

More recently there has been a reconsideration of using blades and vanes made of
laminated materials such as glass cloth, graphite or metal oxide ﬁbers laid up in poly-
meric or metal matrix materials and molded under pressure to ﬁnal airfoil contours.
Determining the modes and frequencies of these composite beams is more exacting.
However, once determined, these data may be used in the same manner as with con-
ventional metal blades. It should also be noted that aeroelastic programs related to
turbomachinery often make a great deal of practical use out of mode and frequency
data determined experimentally from prototype and development hardware.
A major consideration in all material and mode of construction studies is the
determination of mechanical damping characteristics. Brieﬂy stated the damping
may be categorized as material or structural. The former is taken to describe a
volume-distributed property in which the rate of energy dissipation into heat (and
thus removed from the mechanical system) is locally proportional to a small power
of the amplitude of the local cyclical strain. The proportionality constant is deter-
mined by many factors, including the type of material, state of mean or steady strain,
temperature and other minor determinants.
The structural damping will usually be related to interfacial effects, for example in
the blade attachment to the disk or drum, and will depend on normal pressure across
the interface, coefﬁcient of friction between the surfaces, mode shape of vibration,
and modiﬁcation of these determinants by previous fretting or wear. Detailed knowl-
edge about damping is usually not known with precision, and damping information
is usually determined and used in ‘lumped’ or averaged fashion. Comparative calcu-
lations may be use to predict such gross damping parameters for a new conﬁguration,
basing the prediction on the known information for an existing and somewhat similar
conﬁguration. By this statement it is not meant to imply that this is a satisfactory
state of affairs. More precise damping prediction capabilities would be very welcome
in modern aeroelastic studies of turbomachines, and some studies of this nature are
reported in Refs. [1, 2].
The aeroelastic response is central to the analysis of fatigue and fracture of turbo-
machinery blades. The question of crack initiation, crack propagation and destructive
failure cannot be addressed without due attention being given to the type of exci-
tation (forced or self-excited) and the parametric dependencies on the nonsteady
aerodynamic forces. This may be appreciated when it is noted that the modal shape
functions, frequencies and structural damping of a blade change with the crack
growth of the specimen. This concatenation of aeroelasticity and blade failure pre-
diction is presently an active area of research and development.

Nonsteady Potential Flow in Cascades
Unwrapping an annulus of differential height dr from the blade row ﬂow passage
of an axial turbomachine results in a two-dimensional representation of a cascade of
airfoils and the ﬂow about them. The airfoils are identical in shape, equally spaced,
mutually congruent and inﬁnite in number.

Fig. 6 Cascade camberlines modelled by vortex sheets
When a cascade is considered, as opposed to a single airfoil, the fact that the
ﬂexible blades may be vibrating means that the relative pitch and stagger may be
functions of time and also position in the cascade. The steady ﬂow, instead of being
a uniform stream, will now undergo turning; large velocity gradients may occur in
the vicinity of the blades and in the passages between them. These complications
imply that the blade thickness and steady lift distribution must be taken into account
for more complete ﬁdelity in formulating the nonsteady aerodynamic reactions. See
chapters by Whitehead and Verdon in Ref. [1].
A fundamental complication which occurs is the necessity for treating the wakes
of shed vorticity from all the blades in the cascade.
Assume the ﬂow is incompressible. Standard methods of analyzing steady cas-
cade performance provide the steady vorticity distribution common to all the blades,
γs(x), and its dependence on W1 and β1. As a simple example of cascading effects
consider only this steady lift distribution on each blade in the cascade and compute
the disturbance velocity produced at the reference blade by a vibration of al the blades
in the cascade.
In what follows the imaginary index j for geometry and the imaginary index i
for time variation (i.e., complex exponential) cannot be ‘mixed’. That is i j ̸= −1.
Furthermore, it is convenient to replace the coordinate normal to the chord, z, by y
and the upwash on the reference airfoil wa by υ. The velocities induced by an inﬁnite
column of vortices of equal strength, τ, are given by (Fig.6)

2 This so-called ‘periodicity assumption’ of unsteady cascade aerodynamics lends order, in principle
and often in practice, to the processes of cascade aeroelasticity. The mode of every blade is assumed
to be identical, with the same amplitude and frequency but with the indicated blade-to-blade phase
shift. Such a blade row, would be termed ‘perfectly tuned’. Absent this assumption, the cascade
representing a rotor of n blades could have n distinct components (type of mode, modal amplitude,
frequency).

Similar disturbance velocity ﬁelds can be derived for torsional motion, pure chord-
wise motion, etc. Another separate set of disturbance ﬁelds may be generated to take
account of the blade thickness effects by augmenting the steady vorticity distribution
γ (x) by, say −jϵ(x), the steady source distribution, in the above development.
The net input to the computation of oscillatory aerodynamic coefﬁcients is then
obtained by adding the ˜υ of all the effects so described to the LHS of the integral

In this formulation υ1 may be identiﬁed with the unsteady upwash, if any, convected
as a gust with the mean ﬂow and υ2 is the unsteady upwash attributable to vibratory
displacement of all the blades in the cascade, where each blade is represented by
steady vortex and source/sink distribution. It is υ2 that was described for one special
component (pure bending) in the derivation of ˜υ leading to (4.15b).
The component υ3 may be identiﬁed with the unsteady upwash elative to the
zeroth airfoil occasioned by its harmonic vibration.
Since we are dealing here with a linear problem each of the subscripted sub-
problems may be solved separately and independently of the others. It is also impor-
tant to note that since the vortex distributions γ1, γ2 and γ3 representing the lift
distributions on the cascade chordlines are unsteady they must give rise to distribu-
tions of free vortices in the wake of each airfoil of the cascade. In other words vortex
wakes emanate from the trailing edge of each airfoil and are convected downstream:
at a point with ﬁxed coordinates in the wake, the strength of the vortex element instan-
taneously occupying that point will vary with time. Hence, the integral equation will
in general contain a term that is an integral over the wake (c < ξ < ∞) to account
for the additional induced velocities from the inﬁnite number of semi-inﬁnite vortex
wakes. The kernel 1
2π K(ξ −x) accounts in every case for the velocity induced at
(x, 0) by a vortex element at the point (π, 0) on the chord or wake of the reference,
or zeroth, airfoil plus an element of equal strength located at the congruent point
(π + ns sin β, ns cos β) of every other proﬁle of the cascade or its wake. The form
of K may in fact be derived by returning to the previous derivation for ˜υ in (4.9) and

which is the kernel for the isolated airfoil. Hence, the added complexity of solving
the cascaded airfoil problem is attributed to the additional terms giving the more

In contradistinction to the isolated airfoil case, solutions of the unsteady aerody-
namics integral equation cannot be solved in closed form, or in terms of tabulated
functions, for arbitrary geometry (β and s/c) and arbitrary interblade phase angle, σ.
In fact, as noted previously, the thickness distribution of the proﬁles and the steady
lift distribution become important when cascades of small space/chord ratio are con-
sidered to vibrate with nonzero interblade phasing. Consequently, solutions to the
equation are always obtained numerically. It is found that the new parameters β,
s/c and σ are strong determinants of the unsteady aerodynamic reactions. A tabular
comparison of the effect of these variables on the lift due to bending taken from
the data in [3] appears below. In this chart, the central stencil gives the lift coefﬁ-
cient for the reference values of s/c = 1.0, β = 45◦, σ = 0.4pi. Other values in the
matrix give the coefﬁcient resulting from changing one and only one of the governing
parameters.

Compressible Flow
The linearized problem of unsteady cascade ﬂow in a compressible ﬂuid may be
conveniently formulated in terms of the acceleration potential, −p/ρ, where p is the
perturbation pressure, i.e., the small unsteady component of ﬂuid pressure. Using
the acceleration potential as the primary dependent variable, a number of compact
solutions have been obtained for the ﬂat plate cascade at zero incidence. The most
reliable in subsonic ﬂow is that due to Smith [4], and in supersonic ﬂow the solutions
of Verdon [5] and Adamczyk [6] are representative.
Supersonic ﬂow relative to the blades of a turbomachine is of practical importance
in steam turbines and near the tips of transonic compressor blades. In these cases
the axial component of the velocity remains subsonic; hence analytic solutions in
this ﬂow regime (the so-called subsonic leading edge locus) are of the most interest.
It may be that in future applications the axial component will be supersonic. In
this event the theory actually becomes simper so that the present concentration on
subsonic values of Maxial represents the most difﬁcult problem. Currently efforts
are underway to account for such complicating effects as changing back-pressure on
the stage, ﬂow turning, shock waves, etc.
To illustrate the effect of varying the Mach number from incompressible on up to
supersonic, a particular unsteady aerodynamic coefﬁcient has been graphed in Fig.7
as a function of the relative Mach number. It is seen that the variation of the coefﬁcient

Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines
421
Fig. 7 The aerodynamic resonance phenomenon
in the subsonic regime is not great except in the immediate neighborhood of the
so-called ‘resonant’ Mach number, or the Mach number at which ‘aerodynamic
resonance’ occurs.
It is possible to generalize the situation with respect to compressibility by indi-
cating that the small disturbance approximations are retained, but the velocities,
velocity potential, acceleration potential, or pressure (in every case the disturbance
component of these quantities) no longer satisfy the Laplace equation, but rather an
equation of the following type.
(1 −M2)φxx + φyy = 1
a2 φtt −2 M
a φxt = 0
(5.1)
Here M is the relative Mach number and a is the sound speed. Note that the presence
of time derivatives make this partial differential equation hyperbolic whatever the
magnitude of M, a situation quite different from the steady ﬂow equation.
Although the above equation is appropriate to either subsonic or supersonic ﬂow,
the resonance phenomenon occurs in the regime of subsonic axial component of the
relative velocity when geometric and ﬂow conditions satisfy a certain relationship.
Equating the time of propagation of a disturbance along the cascade to the time
for an integral number of oscillations to take place plus the time lag associated with

resonances of the variety described above may be dangerous because they account for

the vanishing, or near vanishing, of all nonsteady aerodynamic reactions including
therefore the important aerodynamic damping. Although it is difﬁcult to establish
with certainty, several cases of large vibratory stresses have been correlated with
the onset of acoustic resonance. It should be recognized that the effects of blade
thickness and nonconstant Mach number throughout the ﬁeld are such as to render
the foregoing formulation somewhat approximate.

and the acoustic resonance manifests itself by a singularity appearing in the kernel K
for special values of k, s, c, τ and β of which K is a function. Under this circumstance
the downwash υa can only remain ﬁnite, as it must physically, by a vanishing of
pa as noted above. The previous development shows why the compressible ﬂow
solutions have received such an impetus from, and are so closely related to, the
acoustic properties of compressor and fan cascades.
Thus the ﬁeld of aeroacoustics, as exempliﬁed in the text of Goldstein [7], and the
ﬁeld of turbomachine aeroelasticity are in a synergistic relationship. This is discussed
more fully in [1].
The acoustic resonance phenomenon, as just described results from standing
waves in blade-ﬁxed coordinates, albeit with impressed throughﬂow velocity, of
the ﬂuid occupying the interblade passages.

Periodically Stalled Flow in Turbomachines
Rotating, or propagating, stall are terms which describe a phenomenon of circum-
ferentially asymmetric ﬂow in axial compressors. Such a ﬂow usually appears at
rotationally part-speed conditions and manifests itself as one or more regions of
reduced (or even reversed) throughﬂow which rotate about the compressor axis at a
speed somewhat less than rotor speed, albeit in the same direction.
A major distinction between propagating stall and surge is that in the former case
the integrated massﬂow over the entire annulus remains steady with time whereas
in the latter case this is not true. The absolute propagation rate can be brought to
zero or even made slightly negative by choosing pathological compressor design
parameters.
If the instigation of this phenomenon can be attributed to a single blade row (as
it obviously must in a single-stage compressor) then insofar as this blade row is
concerned, it represents a periodic stall ing and unstall ing of each blade in the row.
Later or preceding blade rows (i.e., half-stage) may or may not experience individual

424
F. Sisto
blade stall periodically, depending on the magnitude of the ﬂow ﬂuctuation at that
stage, as well as the cascade stall limits in that stage.
The regions of stall ed ﬂow may extend across the ﬂow annulus (full span) or may
be conﬁned either to the root or tip regions of the blades (partial-span stall ) The
number of such regions which may exist in the annulus at any one time varies from
perhaps 1 to 10 with greater numbers possible in special types of apparatus.
The periodic loading and unloading of the blades may prove to be extremely
harmful if a resonant condition of vibration obtains. Unfortunately the frequency of
excitation cannot be accurately predicted at the present time so that avoidance of
resonance is extremely difﬁcult.
The results of various theories concerning propagating stall are all moderately
successfulinpredictingthepropagationalspeed.Howeverthenumberofstall patches
which occur (i.e., the circumferential wavelength of the disturbance) seems to be ana-
lytically unpredictable so that the frequency of excitation remains uncertain. Further-
more, the identiﬁcation of the particular stage which is controlling the propagating
stall , in the sense noted above, is often uncertain or impossible.
This situation with regard to propagating stall has recently been impacted by a
CFD approach using the vortex method of description. In chapter“Stall Flutter” the
vortex method was applied to the analysis of stall ﬂutter. The earlier application,
however, was to propagating (or rotating) stall, i.e. for the ﬂow instability which
can occur with completely rigid blades. The vortex method has been intensively
developed for propagating stall prediction and results [9] indicate that success in
the long sought objective of wavelength prediction is at hand. Improvements that are
required for more useful results are in the boundary layer subroutine executed at each
time step for each blade) and in the enlargement of computing capacity to handle
the number of blades in realistic annular cascades. A further improvement that is
desirable is in the vortex merging algorithm. The vortex method is a time-marching
CFD routine in which the location of a large number of individual vortices are tracked
on the computational domain. New vortices are created at each time step to satisfy
the boundary conditions and separation criteria. Hence, to limit the total number of
vortices in the ﬁeld after many time steps, it is necessary to merge individual vortices,
preferably downstream of the cascade. Many merging criteria may be considered,
related to the strength and position of the candidate vortices.
Although the precise classiﬁcation of vibratory phenomena of an aeromechanical
nature is often somewhat difﬁcult in turbomachines because of the complication due
to cascading and multistaging, it is nevertheless necessary to make such distinctions
as are implied by an attempt at classiﬁcation. The manifestation of stall ﬂutter in
turbomachines is a good example of what is meant. When a given blade row, or
cascade, approaches the install ing incidence in some sense (i.e., stall ing deﬁned by
rapid increase of relative total pressure loss, or deﬁned by rapid increase in deviation
angle, or deﬁned by the appearance of ﬂow separation from the suction surface of the
blades, etc.) it is found experimentally that a variety of phenomena may exist. Thus
the region of reduced throughﬂow may partially coalesce into discrete patches which
propagate relative to the cascade giving rise to the type of ﬂow instability previously
discussed under rotating stall. There is no dependence on blade ﬂexibility.

Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines
425
Under certain other overall operating conditions it is found that in the absence
of, or even coexistent with, the previous manifestation, the blades vibrate somewhat
sporadically at or near their individual natural frequencies. There is no immediately
obvious correlation between the motions of adjacent blades, and the amplitudes of
vibrations change with time in an apparently random manner. (We exclude here all
vibration attributable to resonance with the propagating stall frequency, should the
propagation phenomenon also be present.) This behavior is termed stall ﬂutter or stall
ing ﬂutter and the motion is often in the fundamental bending mode. Another term is
random vibration. Since the phenomenon may be explained on the basis of nonlinear
mechanics, (see the chapter on Stall Flutter) the sporadicity of the vibration can be
attributed provisionally to the fact that the excitation has not been strong enough
to cause ‘entrainment of frequency’, a characteristic of many nonlinear systems.
Hence, each blade vibrates, on the average, as if the adjacent blades were not also
vibrating. However, a careful analysis demonstrates that the instantaneous amplitude
of a particular blade is effected somewhat by the ‘instantaneous phase difference’
between its motion and the motion of the adjacent blade(s). One must also speak
of ‘instantaneous’ frequency since a frequency modulation is also apparent. As a
general statement it must be said that the frequency, amplitude and phase of adjacent
blades are functionally linked in some complicated aeromechanical manner which
results in modulations of all three qualities as functions of time. While the frequency
modulation will normally be small (perhaps less than 1 or 2%) the amplitude and the
phase modulations can be quite large. Here the term phase difference has been used
rather loosely to describe the relationship between two motions of slightly different
frequency. Since this aerodynamic coupling would also depend on the instantaneous
amplitude of the adjacent blade(s), it is not surprising that the vibration gives a
certain appearance of randomness. On the linear theory for identically tuned blades
one would not expect to ﬁnd sporadic behavior as described above. However, it is
just precisely the failure to satisfy these two conditions that accounts for the observed
motion; the average blade system consists of an assembly of slightly detuned blades
(nonidentical frequencies ) and furthermore the oscillation mechanism is nonlinear.
Application of vortex method aerodynamics to a cascade of elastically supported
blades recently has demonstrated [12], in a computational sense, the features of
randomness and sporadicity as described above.
When the relative magnitudes of the nonsteady aerodynamic forces increase it
may be expected that entrainment of frequency will occur. In certain nonlinear sys-
tems it can be shown that the ‘normalized’ frequency interval (ω −ω0)/ω (where ω
is the impressed frequency and ω0 is the frequency of self-excitation) within which
one observes entrainment, is proportional to h/h0, where h is the amplitude of the
impressed motion and h0 is the amplitude of the self-excited oscillation. In case of
entrainment one would expect to ﬁnd a common phase difference between the motion
of adjacent blades which implies also motion with a common ﬂutter frequency. This
latter phenomenon is also termed stalling ﬂutter, although the term limit-cycle vibra-
tion is sometimes used to emphasize the constant-amplitude nature of the motion,
which is often in the fundamental torsional mode.

426
F. Sisto
Finally it should be noted that the distinction between blade instability (ﬂutter)
and ﬂow instability (rotating stall ) is not always perfectly distinct. When the sporadic
stall ﬂutter occurs it is clear that there is no steady tangentially propagating feature of
theinstability.Similarly,whenpropagatingstalloccurswithlittleornovibration(stiff
blades away from resonance) it is apparent that the instability is not associated with
vibratory motion of the blade. However, the limit cycle type of behavior can be looked
upon (due to the simultaneously observed constant interblade phase relationship) as
the propagation of a disturbance along the cascade. Furthermore, the vorticity shed
downstream of the blade row would have every aspect of a propagation stall region.
For instance if the interblade phasing was 180 degrees the apparent stall region
would be on one blade pitch in tangential extent and each would be separated by one
blade pitch of unstall ed throughﬂow. The tangential wavelength is two blade pitches.
Because of the large number of such regions, and the small tangential extent of each,
this situation is still properly termed stall ﬂutter since the blades are controlling and
the blade amplitudes are constant. At the other extreme when one or two stall patches
appear in the annulus it is obvious that the ﬂow instability is controlling and then
the phase relationships between adjacent blade’s motions may appear to be rather
sporadic. At any rate, in the middle ground between these extremes it is probable
that a strong interaction between ﬂow stability and blade stability exists and the two
phenomena cannot be easily separated.
Another distinction may be attempted to assist in understanding the operative
phenomena. When a single airfoil is subjected to an increasing angle of attack an
instability of the ﬂuid may arise, related to the Karman vortex frequency or the
extension of this concept to a distributed frequency spectrum. If the frequency of
this ﬂuid instability coincides with the natural frequency of the blade in any mode
the phenomenon is termed buffeting. If the dynamic moment coefﬁcient (or force
coefﬁcient) attains a negative slope a self-excited vibration known as stall ﬂutter
occurs. The two phenomena may merge when airfoil vibration exerts some inﬂuence
on the vortex shedding frequency. Stall -ﬂutter is usually observed in the torsional
mode and buffeting in the bending mode, but this distinction is not always possible.
These concepts cannot be carried over directly to the cascade where steady bending
amplitudes of the limit cycle variety have been observed. The explanation rests on
the additional degrees of freedom present in the cascaded conﬁguration.

Stall Flutter in Turbomachines
On account of the foregoing complications and the very recent emergence of quanti-
tative CFD-based theories noted in chapter“Stall Flutter” it is not surprising that past
prediction for turbomachines has rested almost entirely on correlation of experimen-
tal data. The single most important parameter governing stall ing is the incidence,
and the reduced frequency has been seen in all aeroelastic formulations to exert a
profound inﬂuence. Hence it is not surprising that these variables have been used to
correlate the data.

Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines
427
Fig. 9 Experimental stall ﬂutter correlation
Typically stall ﬂutter will occur at part-speed operation and will be conﬁned to
those rotor stages operating at higher than average incidence. With luck the region
of ﬂutter will be above the operating line on a compressor map and extend up to
the surge line. Under less fortunate circumstances the operating line will penetrate
the ﬂutter region. The ﬂutter boundary will have the appearance shown on Fig.9.
Contours of constant ﬂutter (or limit cycle oscillation) stress (or tip amplitude) will
run more or less parallel to, and within, the boundary. Traditional parameters for
this typical experimental correlation are reduced velocity, W/bω, (the inverse of
reduced frequency) and incidence, at some characteristic radius such as 75% or 80%
of the blade span for a cantilever blade. The curve is typical of data obtained in
turbomachines or cascades; essentially a new correlation is required for each major
change of any aerodynamic variable (Mach number, stagger, blade contour, etc.). The
structural mode shape will usually be ﬁrst torsion. The single contour shown in the
previous ﬁgure is for that level of cyclic stress (or strain) in the blade material that is
arbitrarily taken to represent some distinct and repeatable measurement attributable
to the ﬂutter vibration and discernible above the ‘noise’ in the strain measuring
system. A typical number might be a stress of 10,000 kPa used to deﬁne the ﬂutter
boundary. However, small changes in relative airspeed, W, may increase the ﬂutter
stress substantially, or, in the case of ‘hard’ ﬂutter, a small increase in incidence
might have a similar effect. Hence, in keeping with the nonlinear behavior described
in chapter“Stall Flutter”, the contours of constant ﬂutter stress may be quite closely
spaced in some regions of the correlation diagram.
Naturally, when considering three-dimensional effects it is the net energy passing
from airstream to airfoil that determines whether ﬂutter will occur, or not. The stall
ed tip of a rotor blade, for example, must extract more energy from the airstream than

428

is put back into the airstream by airfoil sections at smaller radii and that is dissipated
from the system by damping.
This total description of stall ﬂutter in turbomachine rotor blades is consistent
with the appearance of the stall ﬂutter boundary as it appears on the following typical
compressor performance map (Fig.10), the vibrations are usually conﬁned to the ﬁrst
two or three stages. This ﬁgure may be viewed in conjunction with the performance

of a compressor. Keeping in mind that the mass ﬂow parameter ˙m√T0/p0 is virtually
proportional to the throughﬂow velocity in the ﬁrst few stages of a compressor, it is
clear that any typical operating line as shown on the compressor map will traverse
the ﬂutter boundary somewhat as the dotted line on Fig.9.
This explains the general shape and location of the region of occurrence of stall
ﬂutter. Experimental determinations conﬁrm increasing stresses as the region is pen-
etrated from below and the speciﬁc behavior is a function of the aeroelastic properties
of the individual machine, consistent with the broad principles enunciated here.

Choking Flutter
In the middle stages of a multistage compressor it may be possible to discern another
region on the compressor map wherein so-called choking ﬂutter will appear. This
will normally occur at part-speed operation and will be conﬁned to those rotor stages
operatingatlowerthanaverageincidence(probablynegativevaluesareencountered).
The region of ﬂutter will normally lie below the usual operating line on a compressor
map, but individual stages may encounter this type of instability without greatly
affecting operating line; this is particularly true when the design setting angle of
a particular row of rotor blades has been arbitrarily changed from the average of
adjacent stages through inadvertence or by a sequence of aerodynamic redesigns.
The physical manifestation of choking ﬂutter is usually discriminated by a plot
of a stage’s operating line on coordinates of relative Mach number vs. incidence, as

correlation
in Fig.11. On these same coordinates the choke boundaries are shown; a coincidence
or intersection of these graphs indicate the possible presence of choking ﬂutter and
is usually conﬁned to a very small range of incidence values. The mechanism of
choking ﬂutter is not fully understood. It is related to compressibility phenomena
in the ﬂuid and separation of the ﬂow is probably also involved. The graph labelled
‘2 × Loss′
min is a locus of constant aerothermodynamic loss coefﬁcient (closely
related to the drag coefﬁcient of an airfoil); the interior of the nose-shaped region
representing low values of loss, or efﬁcient operation of the compressor stage. The
curve labelled ‘choke boundary’ represents the combination of relative Mach number
and ﬂow angle at which the minimum ﬂow area between adjacent blades (the throat)
is passing the ﬂow with the local sonic velocity. Presumably separation of the ﬂow
at the nose of each airfoil on the pressure surface, and the relative motion between
adjacent blades as they vibrate, conspire to change the effective throat location in
a time dependent manner. These oscillatory changes effect the pressure distribution
on each blade in such a fashion (including a phase angle) as to pump energy from
the airstream into the vibration and thus sustain the presumed motion.
Experimental results [13, 14] bear out the general description of choking ﬂutter
described above. The analytically-based predictions [15, 16] lend further credence
to the mechanism, although the aerodynamic formulation is conﬁned to quasisteady
time dependence. Ultimately a satisfactory explanation and prediction technique will
be likely attained with a time marching computational capability using the compress-
ible Navier-Stokes equations.
Choking ﬂutter occurs in practice with sufﬁcient frequency and destructive poten-
tial as to be an important area for current research efforts as noted above.

Aeroelastic Eigenvalues
Traditionally the analytical prediction of ﬂutter has been conducted by computa-
tion of the aeroelastic eigenvalues for the particular system under investigation. In
turbomachines the eigenvalue determinations have been conducted in the frequency

430
F. Sisto
domain, and the unsteady aerodynamics, excluding separated or choked ﬂow, have
been based on the solutions of the small disturbance equations as described in [3–6]
and elsewhere, and as reviewed effectively in the AGARD Manual [1]. A repre-
sentative sample analysis for the steady loading effect in an inﬁnite cascade was
introduced in Sect.4. In the literature a large number of additional effects are treated,
including compressibility, ﬁnite ﬂow deﬂection, three-dimensionality, ﬁnite shock
strength and shock movement, section thickness and turbine-type geometry.
In every case, however, the initial formulation of the eigenvalue problem for an N-
bladed annular cascade results in a system of mN equations, where m is the number
of degrees of freedom (or else structural modes) assigned to each blade. Since the
disc on which the turbomachine blades are attached will not be completely rigid,
these modeshapes will be ‘system’ modes in which nodal circles and diameters may
be discerned on the disc proper (and its extension into the ﬂow annulus).

n(1 + ign)]{qn} = πb3ω2[F]{qn}
(9.1)
In (9.1) the aeroelastic equation has been specialized for one degree of freedom
per blade (m = 1); hence n ranges from 0 to N-1. This equation, adapted from
Crawley’s Chap.19 in [2], assumes harmonic time dependence at frequency ω and
the nth blade has its individual mass, Mn, natural frequency, ωn, and the structural
damping coefﬁcient, gn. The development leading to (9.1) parallels that for (3.7.32)
for a single foil. (The principal result of considering m > 1 is to replace each matrix
element by a submatrix and enlarge the displacement vector, {qn}).
When the blades on the disc are structurally uncoupled (rigid disc and no inter-
connecting shrouds or lacing wires) the square matrices on the LHS are diagonal and
the equations are coupled only through the aerodynamic force matrix

(9.2)
The matrix is completely populated and each element is an aerodynamic inﬂu-
encecoefﬁcient: the force effect on the row-identiﬁed blade due to the motion of the
column-identiﬁed blade. These are the terms derivable from the previously described
analytical theories under the assumption of constant interblade phase angle, σ, and
harmonic displacement given by
qn = Re[¯qn exp(iωt)]
(9.3)
although Fourier decomposition of the aerodynamic force is necessary to obtain the
form implied by (9.1) and (9.2).
For a ‘tuned’ stage the mass, natural frequency and damping coefﬁcient for every
blade are the same so that the N equations are identical ([F] is circulant) and the

complex eigenvalues

(9.4)
may be obtained from any one of the individual blade equations. Since there are N
possible tuned values of σ, there are N possible [F] matrices and N corresponding
eigenvalues. The particular eigenvalue that obtains in practice will be for those values
of airspeed W (embedded in F) and gn that just produce ωI = 0. That is, the typical
V , g plot is replaced by a family of contours with σ as the parameter. The critical
ﬂutter speed is then obtained by minimizing W with respect to σ, see [10]. In this
sense the aeroelastic behavior of tuned cascades is a straightforward extension of
the single airfoil procedure, to include an additional parameter, the interblade phase
angle.
One of the most intensive recent efforts in turbomachine aeroelastic studies has
been in the area of ‘mistuned’ blade rows. When the mass and/or stiffness of all
airfoils are not identical, or the coupling through the discs or shrouds is not uniform,
then structural mistuning is present. Analogous aerodynamic mistuning results from
nonuniform blade spacing, setting angle of section proﬁle. Such mistuned stages are
inevitably manufactured, subject in degree to inspection and tolerance acceptance
procedures at assembly. The general effect of mistuning is to reduce the symmetry
and cyclical nature of the matrices in the ﬂutter equation, (8.9.1). The character of
the eigenvalue plots and the eigenfunctions become more varied. Thus, at ﬂutter, all
blades are found to vibrate with the same frequency; the relative blade amplitudes
and phase angles are constant with respect to time, but not with respect to location
in the blade row. For each of the eigensolutions, however, there may be associated
a ‘tuned’ interblade phase angle [2]. The most signiﬁcant effect of mistuning is to
change the value of ωI. If the shift of the least stable eigenvalue is in the direction
of increased stability, the proclivity to ﬂutter is reduced and it is for this reason
that mistuning is considered to be a powerful design tool for improving aeroelastic
stability in cascaded airfoils. Figures12a and 12b adapted from [11] show the effect
of mistuning on the position of the eigenvalues (actually iω rather than ω) for a
14-blade cascade.
It is demonstrated that a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for aeroelastic sta-
bility is that the blades be self-damped; the effect of a blade’s motion upon itself must
be to contribute positive aerodynamic damping. The unsteady interactions amongst
or between blades in the cascade are destabilizing for at least one possible σ. This
blade-to-blade destabilizing interference is reduced by mistuning and is hence desir-
able. Mistuning, however, can never produce stability when self-damping is negative.
With nonzero structural damping, blades of larger (blade to air) mass ratio are rela-
tively more stable.
The effect of kinematic coupling (e.g. the presence of some bending displacements
in a predominantly torsional mode) may be quite important in determining stability
whereas dynamic coupling (e.g. through the aerodynamic reactions) is usually not
strong enough to be of signiﬁcance. The effect of mean loading is speculated as being
a possible source of ﬂutter near stall, and stability trends with reduced velocity are

discussed qualitatively in [2], noting both structural and aerodynamic implications
of the reduced frequency parameter.
Optimal mistuning as an intentional manufacturing procedure at assembly is an
important concept, although it must be tempered with the knowledge that, under
forced aerodynamic resonance, so-called ‘rogue’ blades may be identiﬁed which
will vibrate at dangerously high amplitude. More research on mistuning may be
expected to yield increasingly practical results for the turbomachine aeroelastician
to apply beneﬁcially, see [17–19].

Recent Trends
A number of supersonic ﬂutter regimes have been encountered in practice, see
Regions III, IV and V in Fig.13. Only Region III ﬂutter, in either pitching or plung-
ing, will usually be encountered along a normal operating line, and then only at
corrected overspeed conditions. Supersonic aerodynamic theories have been devel-
oped to explain and conﬁrm Region III ﬂutter. Low incidence formulations were
reported by a number of investigators, with greatest interest being attached to the
onset ﬂows having a subsonic axial component. The survey papers by Platzer [21–
24] give an excellent summary of the early aerodynamics literature and experience

Union.
Regions IV and V in Fig.13 are at higher compressor pressure ratio, above the
normal equilibrium operating line, and, in Region V, may involve stall ing at super-
sonic blade relative Mach number. Unsteady aerodynamic analyses appropriate to
this regime have been presented [25, 26]. For the ﬁrst time account was taken of the
effect of shock waves which may appear when the surface Mach number exceeds
unity. Flutter observed in these regions have been mostly ﬂexural, although not exclu-
sively. In Region V stall ing of the ﬂow has been implicated since the region is in
the neighborhood of the surge or stall limit line. Hence Region V is provisionally
termed ‘supersonic bending stall ﬂutter’ and it is assumed that there is a detached
bow shock at each blade passage entrance; i.e., the passage is unstarted. By contrast,
the ﬂutter mechanism in Region IV is thought to involve an in-passage shock wave
whose oscillatory movement is essential for the instability mechanism.
A counterclockwise continuation around Fig.13 returns one to Region I, divided
earlier in Fig.10 and which, it now appears, should be divided into more than one
subregion. The so-called system mode instability seems to be associated with the
upper end of this region, and although the blade loading is high, ﬂutter may not
involve ﬂow separation as an essential part of the mechanism. Instead it has been
hypothesized [27] that even with a subsonic onset ﬂow the surface Mach number
can exceed unity locally and oscillating shocks may help explain the appearance

435
of negative aerodynamic damping. It seems that these instability mechanisms (sep-
aration, oscillating shocks) may both appear in this general region of the fan or
compressor map, although not both at the same time in a particular machine. Thus
the non-aerodynamic factors, which are not revealed by the map parameters and are
discussed in Sect.1, may determine which, if any, of these ﬂutter types will manifest
itself in any particular instance. The clariﬁcation of this matter is still required so that
Region I is now provisionally labelled Subsonic/Transonic Stall Flutter and System
Mode Instability. Region II, discussed in Sect.8 and of relatively lesser importance,
is associated with choking of the passage and is labelled Choke Flutter. As such
the role of oscillatory shock waves is again indicated to be important. Hence for
relatively low negative incidence and high enough subsonic relative Mach numbers,
appropriate to a middle stage of a multistage compressor, the mechanism of choke
ﬂutter has many similarities to the transonic stall ﬂutter of Region I. In addition,
some authors [28] add a second sub-region at a larger negative incidence and lower
relative Mach number, and term it negative incidence stall ﬂutter. The choke ﬂutter
mechanism is still controversial; it may involve the type of machine (fan, compressor
or turbine), type of stage (front, middle, or rear) and structural details (shrouded vs
unshrouded, disc vs drum, etc.).
Three-dimensional unsteady cascade ﬂow was ﬁrst formulated in the 1970s [29,
30]. In order to apply two-dimensional theory to the aeroelastic problems of real blade
systems one must either use a representative section analysis or else apply the strip
hypothesis; i.e., the aerodynamics at one radius is uncoupled from the aerodynamics
at any other radius. In particular, it is known that at ‘aerodynamic resonance’ the
strip theory breaks down and the acoustic modes are strongly coupled radially.
Along with aerodynamic advances the structural description of the blade d-disc
assembly [31, 32], has received a great impetus, and the importance of forward and
backward travelling waves has been ﬁrmly established. Within a particular number
of nodal diameters, coupling between modes has been shown to be signiﬁcant [33]
and the role of the ‘twin modes’ (i.e. sin nφ and cos nφ) in determining propagation
has been clariﬁed. Ford and Foord [34] have used the twin mode concept in both
analysis and ﬂutter measurement. Furthermore, the number of nodal diameters affects
the fundamental natural frequencies slightly so that they cluster together. Coupling
of modes with closely spaced frequencies by aerodynamic means therefore becomes
appreciable and the resulting ﬂutter mode may contain signiﬁcant content from two
or three modes with consecutive numbers of diametral nodes.
A great concentration of studies recently has been in the area of Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupled with a Finite Element Method (FEM) description of
the blade and disk structure. Typically these sets of governing equations are solved
interactively in a time marching fashion to yield the developing ﬂutter amplitudes.
Stability limits are not determined directly per se. For nonlinear systems the limit
cycle amplitudes are predicted while for linear systems the temporal growth of ampli-
tude identiﬁes those values of the operating variables that lie within the instability
boundary.
Usually in these models only spanwise displacements in plunging, pitching and
surging are allowed, leading to beam -type ﬁnite elements for representing a tapered,

436
F. Sisto
twisted blade of variable cross-section [35, 36]. Consequently, when plate- or shell-
type elements are necessitated by airfoil thicknesses on the order of 4 or 5%, the
chordwise deformations cannot be neglected and full three-dimensional FEM pack-
ages must be utilized. Essentially the camber schedule of the blade proﬁles change
with time in these cases.
The FEM-based structural analysis is also essential for static aeroelastic studies
in the nascent ﬁeld of compliant blade performance modiﬁcation. The compliance
of the blade in an annular cascade represents a passive means of controlling the
aerothermodynamic performance of the turbomachine by aeroelastic tailoring. This
topic comes under the overarching subject of aeroservoelasticity, the application of
automaticcontroltheorytofundamentalaeroelasticproblems.Inthebladingofturbo-
machinery the enhanced compliance, and its chordwise distribution, are introduced
intentionally by design. The resulting conﬁguration must be checked for freedom
from dynamic aeroelastic instability, or ﬂutter, over the entire operating range of the
compressor map such as that appearing in Fig.4. It may be remarked that the concept
of performance “map” will have to be extended to include the parametric ependence
of performance on a representative value of a new dimensionless quantity: the ratio
of the dynamic pressure of the ﬂuid to the Young’s modulus of the structure. In effect
the augmentation of compliance introduces variable geometry into the turbomachine
blading.
The small compliance, or conversely great rigidity, of conventional blades is
responsible for only slight amounts of untwist and uncambering. In the design and
development of traditional turbomachines these effects, in turn, have been reﬂected
in very slight corrections to the aerothermodynamic performance as compared to
assuming complete rigidity of the airfoils. This situation will be changed with the
application of static aeroservoelasticity to the design of turbomachines with compli-
ant blades.
Applications of unsteady Navier-Stokes codes to cascaded airfoils appear in refer-
ences [37][38] and [39]. These early studies using Navier-Stokes solvers for unsteady
ﬂows with moving boundaries are chieﬂy of interest for computational prediction.
At present the needed conﬁdence and accuracy are not being obtained because of the
inadequacy of the turbulence model in the CFD code and the extreme requirements
on computer capacity alluded to above.
Subjects receiving attention recently that have not been treated fully include such
topics as ﬁnite shock motion, variable shock strength, thick and highly cambered
blades in a compressible ﬂow, and the effects of curvilinear wakes and vorticity
transport. These and other large amplitude and therefore nonlinear perturbations,
which prevent the linear super-position implicit in classical modal analysis, have
certain implications relative to the traditional solutions of the aeroelastic eigenvalue
problem. The ﬁeld of aeroelasticity in turbomachines continues to be under active
investigation,drivenbytheneedsofaircraftpowerplant,gasturbineandsteamturbine

Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction
Earl H. Dowell and Kenneth Hall
Abstract Modeling of aerodynamic forces has now moved beyond the classical
potential ﬂow theory at least in the research community and to some degree in
engineering practice. These more sophisticated ﬂuid models are based upon the Euler
or Navier- Stokes equations and require substantial computer resources. This has led
to the search for reduced order models that retain the higher physical ﬁdelity of such
ﬂow models while still permitting computationally feasible solutions as described in
this chapter.
In the course of preparing this chapter, a bibliography of over 500 references was
prepared and is available from the authors in electronic form upon request.

The Range of Physical Models
1.1
The Classical Models
The physical models used in treating ﬂuid-structure interaction phenomena vary
enormously in their complexity and range of applicability. The simplest model is the
very popular “piston theory,” which may be thought of as the limit of potential-ﬂow
models as the frequency of an oscillating body in a ﬂuid becomes large. It also may
be thought of as the double limit as the Mach number becomes large, but the product
of the Mach number and amplitude of oscillation normalized by body chord remains
small compared with unity. This simplest theory expresses the ﬂuid pressure p on
the oscillating body at some point x,y and some time t as a simple linear function of
the motion at that same point and instant in time. That is,
p = (ρU/M)

where w is a function of x, y and t and is the instantaneous deﬂection of the body
in the ﬂuid stream, p,U, and M are the free-stream density, velocity, and Mach
number, respectively. This simple ﬂuid mechanics model has been very popular with
structural engineers because it allows the ﬂuid pressure to be incorporated into a
standard structural dynamic with a minimum of additional complexity. But this ﬂuid
modelisphysicallyusefuloveronlyalimitedrangeofﬂowconditions,anditsprimary
value is in checking the results from more complex ﬂuid models in the appropriate
limit. There is a nonlinear version of the piston theory, but it still is limited in the
frequency or Mach number range where it is useful. Lighthill [29], in a classic paper
on the subject, notes the analogy with the pressure on a piston face with a certain
oscillating velocity.
The full-potential theory is a much more formidable model to consider, however.
Even if one assumes the ﬂow is inviscid and irrotational, the full potential-ﬂow theory
requires the solution of a nonlinear wave equation for the velocity potential whose
gradient gives the local ﬂuid velocity components and from which the ﬂuid pressure
may be determined via Bernoulli’s equation. See, for example, Dowell et al. [8]. A
well-known simpliﬁcation is to assume that the motion of the body is small and the
body proﬁle is thin and thus derive a small-perturbation form of the potential-ﬂow
theory that leads to the celebrated linear convected-wave equation for the velocity
potential ; that is,
∇2 −D2
Dt2 = 0.
(2)
where ∇2 is the Laplacian operation and D/Dt is the substantial derivative, which
is, in turn,
D
Dt ≡∂
∂t + U ∂
∂x ,
(3)
The solution of the linear convected-wave equation forms the basis for many of
the ﬂuid-structure interaction models that have been used for ﬂuid-structure interac-
tion stability and response analyses of aircraft. These are termed “ﬂutter” or “gust
response” analyses. See for example the texts by Bisplinghoff et al. (1955) and
Fung [16]. Note that, in deriving Eq. 2, the steady ﬂow about which dynamic per-
turbations are taken is a simple, uniform-constant-velocity ﬂow. While a great deal
of understand of unsteady ﬂows has been gained from the study of Eq. 2, for some
ﬂows of interest, a more complex steady ﬂow must be considered, as is discussed
below.
Solving the convected-wave equation per se is not the primary difﬁculty in deter-
mining the pressure on a wing; rather it is the satisfaction of appropriate boundary
conditions. For example, for a thin wing undergoing bending structural oscillations,
it is required that the (small-perturbation) pressure be zero in the plane of the wing
off the wing surface, but that the ﬂuid velocity normal to the wing surface be equal
to the body or structural velocity on the body surface. Note that, from symmetry and
antisymmetry considerations, one need only consider the ﬂuid in the region above (or
below) the plane deﬁned by the wing (which is treated as a planar body undergoing

oscillations normal to its surface within the small-perturbation approximation). This
gives rise to a mixed-boundary value problem since the boundary conditions involve
both the unknown velocity potential and its gradient over different portions of the
ﬂuid boundary or solution domain.
The solution to this mixed-boundary problem can be obtained by invoking Green’s
theorem or Fourier transforms methods to reduce the convected-wave equation, a
partial differential equation in three spatial dimensions with suitable boundary con-
ditions, to an integral equation that relates the downwash created by the body oscil-
lations (the bracketed term in Eq. 1) to the pressure on the wing. In some contexts
this would be called a boundary element approach. Formally,

the standpoint of the ﬂuid mechanician, to determine a solution to Eq. 4 is to ﬁnd
the unknown pressure p for a prescribed downwash. Of course the structural analyst
thinks of solving a companion structural model to determine the body motion and
hencethedownwashforaprescribedpressure.Theﬂuid-structureinteractionsolution
requires that we solve the ﬂuid and structural models simultaneously for the unknown
pressure and body motion. Normally the solution of Eq. 4 is the more difﬁcult part of
the ﬂuid-structure interaction analysis, not least because the Green’s function K is a
highly singular function that varies as (y −y∗)−2 as y approaches y∗. Nevertheless,
successful numerical techniques have been devised to effect solutions to Eq. 13.4.
Most such solutions are for the special but important case of simple harmonic motion
in time. Of course, from Fourier theory one can in principle determine solutions
for arbitrary time-dependent motion by superposition of the solutions for harmonic
motion. For a thorough elaboration of solution techniques for Eq. 4 for both subsonic
and supersonic ﬂow, see the well-known text by Fung [16], Bisplinghoff et al. (1955),
and Dowell et al. [8]. These solutions today remain the most commonly used in the
design aircraft and are still important for turbomachinery applications as well. Even
so, it has been known for many years that the classical small-perturbation theory has
some substantial limitations. For example, when the ﬂow is transonic with the Mach
number near unity, then shock waves may form, and these must be taken into account
for a physically faithful analysis. Also, in turbomachinery ﬂows, the turning angles
are often so large as to require a nonlinear modeling of the steady ﬂow at the very
least.

1.2
The Distinction Between Linear and Nonlinear Models
There are two distinct approaches here. The simplest, although still more complex
than the classical theory of the linear convected-wave equation, is to ﬁrst determine a
fully nonlinear solution for the steady (time-independent) ﬂow about the body when
the body is not in motion. Thus, the steady-ﬂow solution varies with spatial position
unlike the assumed uniform steady ﬂow of the classical theory. For a transonic ﬂow,
the nonlinear static solution may include a shock wave. Then one considers a small
dynamic perturbation about this steady ﬂow or static solution and assumes that the
subsequent shock motion and all other ﬂow variable vary in a linear fashion with
the body motion. This is usually called a time-linearized or dynamically linear (but
statically linear) model. Such models are discussed in more depth later, in the section
entitled Time-Linearized Models. The governing equation for the dynamically per-
turbed ﬂow is still a linear convected-wave equation, but now the coefﬁcients in the
partial differential equation depend on the steady ﬂow and hence vary with the spatial
coordinates throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld. For subsonic ﬂow or supersonic ﬂow or super-
sonic ﬂow with a Mach Number well removed from unity, this steady ﬂow may be
approximated by a uniform steady ﬂow with a constant ﬂow velocity U everywhere
in the ﬂow ﬁeld as in the classical theory for airfoils and wings. Again, for ﬂows in
turbomachinery, one may ﬁnd the classical approximation less useful.
The solution of the time-linearized equations rather than the full nonlinear equa-
tions usually leads to at least an order of magnitude reduction in computer costs and is
often sufﬁcient for describing accurately many interesting physical phenomena, for
example, the onset of instabilities of the ﬂuid-structure system or even of the ﬂuid
alone. The concept of time linearization may be used not only for potential-ﬂow
models, but also in the context of the more elaborate and general Euler equations for
an inviscid rotational ﬂow or even the Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous ﬂow.
As an example of a time-linearized analysis for the Navier-Stokes equations, one
may recall the much studied hydrodynamic stability theory; for example, see the
well-known text by Lin [30].
The other approach is of course to attempt to determine a fully dynamically
nonlinear solution. This approach is discussed in more depth in the section entitled
Nonlinear Dynamical Models and involves the numerical solution of a nonlinear
convected-wave equation for potential ﬂow and more elaborate equations for the
Euler or Navier-Stokes models. Once one is committed to determining nonlinear
solutions, be they steady (static) or unsteady, then normally a ﬁnite-difference scheme
in the spatial variable will be required that converts the nonlinear partial differential
equation model in space and time to a very large system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) in time only. The size of the system is often very large indeed,
involving 104 to ≥106 ODEs. This is the ﬁeld of computational ﬂuid dynamics
(CFD). See, for example, various review articles on the CFD approach to unsteady
aerodynamics by Tijdeman and Seebass [45], McCroskey [32], Seebass et al. (1986)
and Nixon [34] and Edwards et al. [10].

Computational Fluid Dynamics Models
With a CFD approach, one can in principle consider not only the potential-ﬂow mod-
els of irrotational ﬂow, but also the inviscid rotational models of the Euler equations
and indeed the viscous models of the Navier-Stokes equations. As is well known,
however, the computational resources required to treat the Navier-Stokes equations
de novo even today are beyond our capabilities, and therefore various empirical
models of turbulence have been developed so that solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations can be made computationally tractable. Such empirical models of tur-
bulence effectively allow one to construct a mathematical model that avoids the
nonlinear dynamics of the transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow. In this review,
we discuss only brieﬂy the basic elements of the CFD approach. However, as will
be emphasized, the important work that has been done over many years by the CFD
community is now beginning to bear fruit for ﬂuid-structure interaction analysis with
the advent of what is usually called reduced-order modeling.
1.4
The Computational Challenge of Fluid Structure
Interaction Modeling
The ﬂuid-structure interaction analyst has a special challenge. If one wished to obtain
solutions for many difference combinations of structural and ﬂuid parameters, then
the solutions to the CFD and other ﬂuid models must be made as computationally
efﬁcient as possible. Typically a design team may wish to evaluate thousands of
parameter variations as various structural elements are changed in the design process.
For many years, in the analysis of complex structures, the ﬁnite-element model
for a structural body undergoing oscillations has been “reduced” in size by ﬁrst
ﬁnding the natural or eigenmodes of the structure and then recasting the ﬁnite-
element structural model in terms of these modes, using, for example, Lagrange’s
equations from classical dynamics. Typically a ﬁnite-element structural model of a
few thousand degrees of freedom has been reduced to a modal model with a few
tens of degrees of freedom. See, for example, Dowell et al. [8]. This reduces not
only the size of the model but also the computational cost by orders of magnitude,
while providing new insights into the physical phenomena through a consideration
of the structural modal behavior. Such an approach has only recently been proposed
and successfully pursued for ﬂuid models. However in the last few years it has been
shown that such an approach gives remarkable beneﬁts in terms of computational cost
savings and also in terms of increasing our insight into the dynamics of ﬂuid models
by considering their modal structure. Hence, in this review considerable attention is
given to these new developments. See the section entitled Reduced-Order Models
below. Now, we turn to a more thorough exposition of some of the issues we have
touched upon so far.

Time-Linearized Models
Time-linearized models are a broad and very interesting class of ﬂuid models that are
extremely powerful and useful in dealing with ﬂuid-structure interaction phenomena.
First, a few special cases that are well known in the literature are considered, and
then the general case is treated. For the reader who prefers deductive to inductive
reasoning, the general case is treated at the end of this section and may be consulted
ﬁrst. The basic notion is that a steady-ﬂow ﬁeld is ﬁrst determined that is the base ﬂow
about which a dynamic, small perturbation is considered. Only linear terms in the
dynamic perturbation are retained, and thus the governing equations for the dynamic
perturbation are linear in the dynamic or time-dependent unknowns with coefﬁcients
that depend on the (nonlinear) base steady-ﬂow or static-equilibrium solution.
2.1
Classical Aerodynamic Theory
In classical aerodynamics, the base ﬂow is taken to be the simplest imaginable, that
is, a uniform steady ﬂow. Physically this may be thought of as the ﬂow around an
inﬁnitesimally thin, ﬂat plate aligned with a uniform oncoming ﬂow velocity. Or
to say it another way, any thickness or proﬁle deviation from a thin ﬂat plate gives
rise to a small perturbation to the uniform ﬂow itself so that the effects of ﬁnite
thickness, airfoil or wing proﬁle (camber or curvature), and airfoil or wing motion
can be treated separately as linear perturbations to the uniform steady ﬂow, and
therefore their effects may simply be added together or superimposed. Hence, the
governing equation for a potential ﬂow is Eq. 13.2, as previously discussed. Much
of the literature on ﬂuid-structure interaction uses this model. And it is perhaps the
simplest model that is based on time linearization. However there are others.
2.2
Classical Hydrodynamic Stability Theory
One of the most fascinating issues in unsteady ﬂuid mechanics is the transition from
laminar to turbulent ﬂow. Some of the most famous investigators in the ﬁeld of
ﬂuid mechanics have addressed this issue, for example, Werner Heisenberg, G.I.
Taylor, and Theodore Von Karman (see Lin [30]). A central question is under what
circumstances a laminar ﬂow loses its stability and begins the process of transition to
turbulence. Hydrodynamic-stability theory examines the small dynamic perturbation
of a laminar ﬂow ﬁeld and determines the condition for the loss of stability. The theory
is a subtle one, and a connected and authoritative account is provided by Lin [30]
in his celebrated book. The best known aspect of this theory is that which considers
the stability of a parallel shear ﬂow. In this model the underlying steady ﬂow is a
nonlinear viscous solution to Navier-Stokes equations, but to simplify the model and

Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction
445
subsequent calculations, the steady ﬂow is often assumed to vary only normal to a
ﬂat plate of inﬁnite extent, but not to vary in the ﬂow direction or in the spanwise
direction. Hence, the steady ﬂow is a function of only one spatial variable in the
direction transverse to the plate and the ﬂow. Therefore, in the dynamic perturbation
analysis, the governing equation is a linear one show coefﬁcients depend only on
the transverse spatial variable. This allows a Fourier decomposition in both time
and the spatial direction aligned with the ﬂow (and in the spanwise direction as
well). This leads then to the famous Orr-Sommerfeld equation which has challenged
ﬂuid mechanicians for many years. The assumption of a parallel shear ﬂow over
an inﬁnite plate may or may not model all the interesting physics of a spatially
evolving viscous steady ﬂow on an airfoil, of course. The invocation of this severe
assumption is a measure of the complexity of considering the spatially developing,
steady-boundarylayeranditsdynamicperturbationwhenthehydrodynamic-stability
theory was ﬁrst being developed more than 50 years ago. This restrictive assumption
has been attacked by subsequent investigators, but the range of geometries considered
to date has still been somewhat limited.
2.3
Parallel Shear Flow with An Inviscid Dynamic
Perturbation
A further simpliﬁcation to hydrodynamic-stability theory that is sometimes useful
is to neglect the viscous terms in the dynamic perturbation per se, but still include
their effect in determining the steady ﬂow. This may be thought of as an inviscid
perturbation about the viscous steady ﬂow. While such a model clearly cannot treat
the stability of the viscous steady-ﬂow ﬁeld per se, it may be useful in computing
the pressure on a wall over which the boundary layer thickness does not vary greatly.
By scaling arguments, one may deduce when the neglect of the viscous terms in
the dynamic perturbations may be justiﬁed. Such a model has been proposed by
Miles [33] and Anderson and Fung [1] in the context of ﬂuid-structure interaction and
has been applied successfully by Dowell [6] to the determination of the stability of an
elasticplateinteractingwithaﬂowstream,theso-calledpanelﬂutterproblem.Dowell
has shown that the boundary layer effect on the unsteady aerodynamic pressure is
most pronounced for transonic ﬂows and is relatively less important for subsonic
and supersonic ﬂows, in agreement with the experimental evidence.
Formally, for a slowly varying boundary layer thickness, one may also determine
the solution for the pressure on an airfoil or wing, using the shear ﬂow model.
Speciﬁcally, one may derive a new Kernel or Green’s function so that the solution
techniques of classical aerodynamics may be applied. But this model has not been
widely used, although it may have some utility for treating the effect of a boundary
layer on a wing control surface, for example (see Chi and Dowell [4]).

2.4
General Time-Linearized Analysis
To consider the most general case, we consider a generic form of a CFD model
in which, for example, a ﬁnite-difference technique is used to convert the partial
differential equations of a nonlinear ﬂow model, whether potential, Euler, or Navier-
Stokes, to a large system of ODEs in time. Thus, formally, one has
∂
∂t {q} = {Q(q)} + {B(x, y, z, t)}.
(5)
Here q is a vector of unknown variable to be determined throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld,
Q is a known function of the q (i.e. for a given q, one knows Q), and B is some
known function that expresses the motion of a structure or body in the ﬂuid. Of
course there are additional parameters determined by the far upstream conditions
and the properties of the ﬂuid, for example, the upstream Mach number. Formally, a
dynamic-perturbation analysis may proceed as follows: one sets
B = B0 + ˆB(t),
q = q0 + ˆq(t).
(6)
Where B0 and q0 depend only on x, y, z, but not on t, that is, they form a steady-ﬂow
solution to Eq. 13.5. Substituting Eq. 13.6 into Eq. 13.5 and retaining only linear
terms in ˆq, one has the governing linear small-perturbation equations for ˆq which
have coefﬁcients that depend on the steady-ﬂow solution, q0 , as follows:
∂
∂t {q} =
∂Q
∂q

q=q0

{ˆq} + {ˆq}.
(7)
Standard and novel means for solving large systems of such equations have been
developed.
Note that if ˆB = 0 in Eq. 7, then one has a eigenvalue problem. This can be
exploited effectively by ﬁrst solving the eigenvalue/eigenvector problem and recon-
stituting Eq. 7 in terms of a small number of eigenvectors or eigenmodes. This leads
to one class of so-called reduced-order models (ROMs). All such ROMs, which are
discussed in more detail below, are based on this notion of a few dominant modes
that may be represented by some relatively small linear combination of eigenmodes.
However, even without appealing to eigenmodes per se, the solution of Eq. 7 offers
an attractive and powerful way of describing unsteady ﬂows. This is especially the
case if we consider simple harmonic motion and use a Fourier series (for periodic
motion) or Fourier integral (for arbitrary time-dependent motion) to construct the
solution for any time dependence from the basic solution of harmonic motion.
Here we emphasize the physical effects that such time-linearized models may
include. For example, the steady ﬂow may include shock waves and also separated
ﬂows. The dynamic perturbation ansatz does require that the oscillations of shocks

Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction
447
or separated ﬂow regions be sufﬁciently small, but there are many ﬂow conditions
in which that is true. For example, if a small dynamic perturbation is assumed, it is
required that shock wave motions be small compared with the airfoil or wing chord
and that the dynamic variation in shock strength, for example, the jump in pressure
through the shock, be small compared with that of the steady shock. Similar restric-
tions apply to separated ﬂow regions. Also, of course, limit cycle oscillations due to
ﬂuid nonlinearities are not modeled when time linearization is assumed. Note, how-
ever, that the effects of turbulence can be included formally within the framework of
the empirical turbulence models frequently used in CFD application, e.g. Baldwin-
Lomax models, k −ϵ models, etc. In this regard it is worth noting that to construct
a dynamical perturbation model one needs to be able to differentiate Q with respect
to q. Doing this for the original ﬂuid equations, e.g. Euler or Navier-Stokes, is not
a problem, at least formally. However some empirical turbulence models introduce
nondifferentiable functions that can pose practical computational difﬁculties in con-
structing dynamic-perturbation models. Of course, if one has an exact steady-ﬂow
solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations, then a dynamic-perturbation anal-
ysis follows without any especial difﬁculty. In particular it may be noted that such
models allow, in principle, a hydrodynamic-stability analysis that fully accounts for
the spatial distribution of a laminar steady ﬂow prior to its becoming unstable.
2.5
Some Numerical Examples
As a typical example, we show results from a computation by Florea et al. [14] for a
separated ﬂow over a cascade of airfoils. One purpose of this example is to show that
one can calculate quantities such as the time variation of boundary layer thickness
and skin friction as well as pressure or pitching moment on an airfoil with such
models. Here an empirical turbulence model has been used in the CFD code, and a
time-linearized solution has been developed. See Figs. 1 and 2.
3
Nonlinear Dynamical Models
A nonlinear dynamical model is almost invariably cast in the form of a CFD model
with spatial discretization by ﬁnite-difference techniques or other methods. Thus one
starts with a system of ODEs such as those of Eq. 13.5. The most popular form of
solution for such equations has been a time-marching technique. However, there are
severe practical computational difﬁculties associated with the size of such system of
equations, which may be on the order of 106, and equally important, with the small
step in time that one must take with such equations because of numerical stability
considerations. In the language of numerical analysis, these equations are “stiff.”
The end result has been that such models have been infrequently used beyond the
research community. Even for research purposes, when such CFD models are used

in combination with structural models, the range of the parameter space that can
be explored has been relatively modest. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been
made and some techniques have been developed to make such models more attractive

techniques, which effect a solution in the frequency domain. Second are system
identiﬁcation techniques that allow the nonlinear (and linear) models to be expressed
more compactly. The latter, used in combination with the third approach, i.e. reduced-
order-modeling techniques, offers considerable promise for future development, as
does the harmonic-balance methodology.

Harmonic Balance Method
In the harmonic-balance method, one takes the time dependence of the solution to
be a Fourier series in time, for example,

Lan and his coworkers (Greco et al. [17, 18] and Hwang and Lan [26]) have used a
single term in such a Fourier expansion and investigated the nonlinear potential-ﬂow
model in a series of interesting papers. Of course for sufﬁciently small amplitudes
of airfoil or wing motion (and therefore ﬂuid motion), a single-term approximation
may sufﬁce. In the limit of inﬁnitesimal motion, such an analysis becomes a time-
linearized model. More recently, Hall and his coworkers (2000) have considered
multipleharmonictermsintheFourierseriesanddevelopedcomputationallyefﬁcient
methods for extracting the nonlinear solution to the Euler equations. Lan and his
coworkers (Greco et al. [17, 18] and Hwang and Lan [26]) have applied his method
to airfoils and wings, while Hall developed his methodology for turbomachinery
applications to cascades of airfoils. Hall et al. [19] have shown that a few harmonics
are normally sufﬁcient to describe the ﬂow ﬁeld accurately, even for rather large

airfoil and ﬂuid motions. Both Lan and Hall note that a harmonic balance approach
allows the analyst to take advantage of the many computational-solution techniques
that have been developed for steady-ﬂow solvers over the years.
3.2
System Identiﬁcation Methods
Several authors have considered system identiﬁcation methods. Among these,
Silva [40, 41] has suggested the adaptation of the Volterra/Wiener approach that
has been developed in the ﬁeld of signal processing. Formally, by considering a
small number of inputs (structural motions) and outputs (e.g. lift and moment on
an airfoil), the nonlinear input/output relationships can be modeled with a relatively
small number of equations. This approach has considerable promise; however, if the
inputs or outputs of interest change, then the model must be reconstructed. Also the
dynamics of the system are essentially treated as a “black box”, and the internal
dynamics of the total governing equations and hence the ﬂuid are to some degree
masked by this approach.
Silva chooses the integral formulation for the input/output model and deﬁnes a
hierarchy of impulse or temporal Green’s functions. For example, if y(t) is a typical
output and u an input, then following Volterra and Wiener, one may postulate a form
of input/output relationship as follows:
y(t) =

n
 ∞
−∞
hn(σ ∗
1 , σ ∗
2 , .....)u(t −σ ∗
1 )u(t −σ ∗
2 )....dσ ∗
1 dσ ∗
2 ...
(9)
The corresponding differential equation form is
∂y
∂t = A0 + A1y + A2y2 + ...... + Anyn + Bu
(10)
Silva suggests techniques for deducing hn in Eq. 9, and there are also methods in the
literature for deducing the coefﬁcients, A0, A1, .....An, etc, in Eq. 10, given u and
with y determined by a numerical simulation. Please note that, formally, Eq. 10 may
be obtained from Eq. 5 by expanding Q(q) in a Taylor series and noting that there
exists a linear transformation between y and q. Note that, while Eqs. 9 and 10 are
written here as scalar equations for simplicity, there are generalizations to a vector
form available.
3.3
Nonlinear Reduced-Order Models
Of course formally one may determine a modal representation for q from a time-
linearized analysis and use these modes to reduce the full nonlinear dynamical model

Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction
451
(see Eq. 5). Such a technique has been used for structural models of relatively high
dimension for some years, (e.g. see Dowell [7]), but it is only now being explored
for CFD models. The nonlinear dynamic models are a subject of current research,
but it does appear that there are several promising alternatives that may lead to
advances in our ability to deduce more compact models, which will lead to a greater
understanding of such models and improve their computational efﬁciency.
3.4
Reduced-Order Models
The use of CFD models for systematically investigating unsteady aerodynamic ﬂows
has been a goal since the advent of the computer age. Many investigators have
demonstrated the potential utility of CFD for improving the physical modeling of
complex unsteady ﬂows. However, until recently the computational cost associated
with the high dimensionality of these models has precluded their use in routine
applications for studying aeroelastic phenomena. Thus the research literature has
been voluminous, but the applications in industry have been relatively few in number.
Recent work on a conceptually novel and computationally efﬁcient technique for
computing unsteady ﬂows based on the modal character of such ﬂows is described
below. Eigenmode-based, reduced-order models (ROMs) are given prominence
although other related modal descriptions also prove useful and are discussed as
well.
Why study the eigenmodes of unsteady aerodynamic ﬂows? This is perhaps the
fundamental question most often asked, although occasionally someone will express
surprise that eigenmodes even exist for these ﬂows. The reason are several:
1. Eigenvalues and eigenmodes for these ﬂows do exist! So perhaps they can tell us
something about the basic physical behavior of the ﬂow ﬁeld.
2. Indeed, if a relatively small number of eigenmodes are dominant, this immediately
suggests a way to construct an efﬁcient computational aerodynamic model using
these dominant modes.
3. Constructing the aerodynamic model in eigenmodal form is a particularly attrac-
tive way to combine the eigenmode aerodynamic model with a number of degrees
of freedom for a given desired level of accuracy. These aeroelastic models will be
especially useful for design studies, including the active control of such systems.
4. Finally, as will be seen, alternative modal descriptions are available. While their
usefulness is predicated on the existence of eigenmodes, these other modal
descriptions seek to induce more information on the ﬂow response to enhance the
accuracy of a reduced model of a given dimension or reduce the dimension for
a required accuracy compared with a standard eigenmode representation. More-
over, for one descriptor, the so-called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
modes, one may avoid the necessity of a tedious direct eigenvalue evaluation of
the CFD equations, a major advantage of using these modes.

For a more in depth discussion of this work, see, for example, Hall [21], Dowell
et al. [5, 9]; earlier work is noted in those references.
3.5
Constructing Reduced Order Models
There are two distinct ways of going about constructing ROMs, although there are
many variations on the basic themes. One approach is to characterize the aerodynamic
ﬂow ﬁeld in terms of a relatively small number of global modes. By a mode we mean
a distribution of ﬂow ﬁeld variables that characterizes a gross motion of the ﬂow.
The conceptually simplest way of choosing such a set of modes is to consider the
eigenmodes of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Of course, such modes form a complete set, and any
ﬂow ﬁeld distribution can be expressed in terms of such eigenmodes. Formally,
the eigenvectors are used to effect a linear transformation from the original set of
(local) ﬂow variables used in the CFD model, such as pressure, density, and velocity
components at a spatial grid point, to a new modal set of global coordinates. The
new modal equations are uncoupled due to the orthogonality of the eigenvectors. In
particular any alternative modal selection, and we consider several, can always be
expressed in terms of such eigenmodes.
Indeed, it is the existence of eigenmodes that underpins any modal description of
the ﬂow. As with other simpler mechanical systems, it is the hope and expectation,
borne out in the results to be shown later, that a relatively small number of modes
will prove adequate to describe the ﬂow. Thus, a typical CFD model, which may
have 104 to 106 or more degrees of freedom, may be reduced to a model containing
only 101 to 102 modes, which is capable of accurately describing the pressure on an
oscillating aerodynamic surface.
The second category of ROMs does not explicitly rely on a modal description per
se, but rather appeals to the idea that only a small number of inputs, that is, structural
motions or modes, and a correspondingly small number of outputs, that is, general-
ized forces or speciﬁc integrals of the aerodynamic pressure distribution weighted
by the structural mode shapes, are of interest. Hence one may construct, for example,
a transfer function matrix whose size is determined by the number of inputs and out-
puts. Typically the size of this matrix will be on the order of the number of structural
modes. The transfer functions are determined numerically using a systems identi-
ﬁcation technique from time simulations calculated by using the CFD code. If the
number or type of inputs, that is, the structural modes, changes during an aeroelastic
simulation, then the aerodynamic-transfer functions may need to be recalculated. On
the other hand, the CFD code does not require deconstruction to determine aerody-
namic modal information, thereby saving this additional effort but also foregoing
the additional insight and ﬂexibility gained by knowing the aerodynamic modes.
Changes in the structural modes do not change the aerodynamic eigenmodes, of
course, but changes in the structural modes may require recalculation of the transfer
functions of aerodynamic input/output models.

3.6
Linear and Nonlinear Fluid Models
Two points that arise in the use of a model representation are worthy of mention. For
nonlinear dynamical systems, it is possible to extend the idea of a linear eigenmode
itself to nonlinear eigenmodes. See, for example, the book by Troger and Steindl [46]
and Chap. 7 of the present book for a readable account of these ideas. This point has
some theoretical interest. However, these nonlinear eigenmodes still lead to coupled
modal equations, so their value in practice is often not substantially greater than
that of linear eigenmodes for ROM systems of several (say 10 or more) degrees of
freedom.
The second noteworthy point is that, if one determines the linear eigenmodes for
say one airfoil-Mach number combination and then uses an eigenvector transforma-
tion for another airfoil-Mach number combination, then the corresponding modal
equations will also be coupled even in the linear terms. This, of course, is because
we have used the eigenmodes of one ﬂuid system to represent the dynamics of a dif-
ferent ﬂuid system. That is, orthogonality of the modes only holds for eigenmodes
used for the same dynamical system from which they are derived. Nevertheless, if
the eigenvectors do not change appreciably with, for instance, Mach number, these
coupled modal equations may still be adequate, and thus one may avoid recomputing
the eigenvector for each change in Mach number.

Eigenmode Computational Methodology
For the simpler (lower dimensional) ﬂuid models, for example, a two-dimensional
vortex lattice model of unsteady ﬂow about an airfoil, the size of the eigenvalue
matrix is on the order of 100 × 100. For such matrices, standard eigenvalue extraction
numerical procedures may be used. We have used EISPACK, a standard algorithm
and computer code available in most computational centers in the United States.
For morecomplicatedﬂuidmodels (e.g. thefull potential models or Euler models),
the order of the eigenvalue matrix may be in the range of 1000–10,000 squared or
greater. For matrices of this size, new developments in eigenvalue extraction have
been required. We have used methods based on the Lanczos algorithm. For the full-
potential equation (1000 × 1000), an efﬁcient and effective algorithm is described
by Hall et al. [22]. For the Euler equations (104 × 104 ), the paper by Romanowski
and Dowell [37] will be of interest. The discussion by Mahajan et al. [31] is also
recommended to the reader. As the extensions to three-dimensional and viscous
ﬂows are made, further developments in eigenvalue and eigenmode determination
will likely be required or desired.
To improve the convergence of the eigenmode ROM representation, that is, to
reduce the number of eigenvectors retained, a so-called static-correction method is
useful, as was ﬁrst noted by Hall. In this approach, Eq. 7 is ﬁrst solved by setting the

454
E. H. Dowell and K. Hall
left-hand side to zero, and then a correction is determined by expanding the difference
between this solution and the full solution of Eq. 7 in terms of eigenmodes.
However an alternative method may be preferable, as described below.
3.8
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Modes
Given the difﬁculty of extracting eigenmodes for very high-dimensional systems (e.g.
> 104 ), it is of great interest to note that a simpler modal approach is available, as
recently developed by Romanowski [36]. This approach adapts a methodology from
the ﬁelds of nonlinear dynamics and signal processing, that is, the POD or Karhunen-
Loeve (KL) modal representation. See Romanowski [36] for an introduction to the
relevant literature in this ﬁeld.
Here we quote Romanowski’s account of the essence of the method.
Karhunen-LoeveDecomposition(KLDecomposition)[alsocalledproperorthogonaldecom-
position (POD)] has been used for a broad range of dynamic system characterization and
data compression applications. The procedure, which is brieﬂy summarized below, results
in an optimal basis for representing the given data ensemble.
The instantaneous ﬂow ﬁeld vector, q j, is retained at J discrete times, such that j =
1, 2, 3, ....J. A caricature ﬂow ﬁeld, ¯q j , is deﬁned as the deviation of each instantaneous
ﬂow ﬁeld from the mean ﬂow ﬁeld, ¯q j, of the ensemble:
˜q j = q j −¯q j.
(9)∗
(11)
A1 matrix  is formed as the ensemble of the two-point correlation of the caricature ﬂow
ﬁelds, such that
 jk = ˜qT
j ˜qT
k .
(10)
(12)
References (10) and (12) [of Romanowski 1996] show that solving the eigenvalue problem
[]{v} = λ{v}
(11)
(13)
produces an optimal set of basis vectors, [V] = [{v1}, {v2}, ....{v j}] for representing the
ﬂow ﬁeld ensemble. Additionally, the magnitude of the eigenvalue, λ j gives a measure of
the participation of the jth KL [or POD] eigenvector in the ensemble. Therefore, a reduced
set of basis vectors can easily be found by limiting the set to only those KL eigenvectors
corresponding to sufﬁciently large eigenvalue.
Since the number of time steps and thus the order of matrix needed to compute
a reasonable and useful set of KL or POD modes is typically on the order of 1000,
the determination of POD modes is computationally very inexpensive, especially
as compared to determining the eigenmodes of the original ﬂuid dynamics model.
In the subsequent section, results using POD modes are shown to be in excellent
agreement with those obtained from the full-order model and also the ROM based
on eigenmodes. It also might be noted that one can ﬁrst use the POD decomposition
to reduce the order of the original model and then do a further eigenmode analysis
of the ROM, a technique that may be useful for some applications.

As a ﬁnal comment on the POD or KL methodology, it is important to note that
a similar calculation may be done in the frequency domain by assuming simple
harmonic solutions and replacing the data at discrete time steps with data at dis-
crete frequencies over a frequency internal of interest. Kim [28] has used the POD
frequency domain method for a vortex lattice ﬂuid model and Hall et al. [20] and
Thomas et al. [44] have done so for an Euler ﬂuid model, including shock waves at
transonic conditions.
3.9
Balanced Modes
Baker et al. [2] have used this methodology originally developed in the controls
community to develop reduced-order aerodynamic models. Rule et al. [38] have
explored this method as well. This basic notion is that balanced modes are in some
sense an optimal descriptor within the framework of POD modes for a given family
of inputs or structural motions and the aerodynamic outputs of interest. See also the
discussion of balanced modes in the Appendix.
3.10
Synergy Among the Modal Methods
In light of the above discussion, the following methodology appears to be a practical
andperhapsevenanoptimumapproach.WithagivenCFDmodel,asetofPODmodes
can be constructed with on the order of 102 −103 degrees of freedom. Then, using the
POD modes and the corresponding ROM (POD/ROM), a further reduction may be
obtained by extracting eigenmodes or balanced modes from the POD/ROM. For some
applications in which the smallest possible model is desired, for example, design
for active control of an aeroelastic system, this further reduction will be desirable
and perhaps essential. However, for validation studies where the identiﬁcation and
understanding of the most critical modes for stability are the primary issue, one may
prefer to retain a POD/ROM or an eigenmode ROM.
3.11
Input/Output Models
There is a long tradition of developing aerodynamic transfer function representations
from numerical data for simple harmonic motion dating from the time of Jones’s
approximation to the Theordorsen function. Much of the relevant literature is sum-
marized by Karpel [27], whose own contribution was to develop a state-space or
transfer function representation of minimum order for a given level of accuracy
by using transfer function ideas based on data for simple harmonic motion. Hall et
al. [20] have recently discussed such models in light of the more recent developments

456
E. H. Dowell and K. Hall
in aerodynamic modal representations. Their discussion follows. See Bisplinghoff
et al. (1955) and Karpel [27] for references to the original literature.
Investigators have developed a number of techniques to reduce the complexity of unsteady
aerodynamic models. R.T. Jones approximated indicial lift functions with series of exponen-
tials in time. Such series have particularly simple Laplace transforms, i.e., rational polynomi-
alsintheLaplacevariables,makingthemespeciallyusefulforaeroelasticcomputations.Pade
approximants are rational polynomials whose coefﬁcients are found by least-squares curve
ﬁtting the aerodynamic loads computed over a range of frequencies. Vepa [48], Edwards [11],
and Karpel [27] developed various forms of the matrix Pade approximant technique. Their
approach reduces the number of so-called augmented states needed to model the various
unsteady aerodynamic transfer functions (lift due to pitching, pitching moment due to pitch-
ing, etc.) by requiring that all the transfer functions share common poles.
. . . [A POD or eigenmode model] is similar in form to that obtained using a matrix Pade
approximate for the unsteady aerodynamics...and has some of the same advantages of the
Pade approach. Both methods produce low degree-of-freedom models. Furthermore, both
require the aerodynamic lift and moment transfer functions to share common eigenval-
ues (although the zeros are obviously different). This is appealing because physically the
poles should be independent of the type of transfer function. However, the present (modal)
approach has several advantages over the matrix Pade approximate method. The present
method attempts to compute the actual aerodynamic poles, or at least the poles of a rational
CFD model. The Pade approach, on the other hand, selects pole locations by some form of
curve ﬁtting (of aerodynamic data for simple harmonic motion). In fact, some Pade tech-
niques can produce unstable aerodynamic poles, even for stable aerodynamic systems.
It is interesting that the notion of a transfer function can be extended to nonlinear
dynamical systems where the counterpart is usually called a describing function.
Ueda and Dowell [47] pioneered and discussed this approach. The describing func-
tion may be considered a single harmonic-balance method.
In the time domain transfer functions can be inverted to form convolution inte-
grals. Silva [40, 41] has recently pioneered the extension of these ideas to nonlinear
aerodynamic models, using the concept of a Volterra integral.
3.12
Structural, Aerodynamic, and Aeroelastic Modes
Structural modes have a long and rich tradition. The novelty of much that is being
discussed here is to extend such ideas to aerodynamic ﬂows that also possess a modal
character, albeit a more complex one. And ﬁnally there are aeroelastic modes one
may consider.
For the determination of structural modes, one normally neglects dissipation or
damping and thus only models kinetic energy (or inertia) and potential strain energy
(or stiffness) of the structure. The eigenvalues are real (the natural frequencies
squared) as are the corresponding eigenmodes. Physically, if one excites the structure
with a simple harmonic oscillation at a frequency near that of an eigenvalue, the
structure will perform a simple harmonic oscillation at that same frequency, whose
spatial distribution is given by the corresponding eigenvector.

Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction
457
For aerodynamic modes (and also for aeroelastic modes), the physical interpreta-
tion as well as the mathematical determination of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
or eigenmodes is more subtle and difﬁcult, but still rewarding. First of all, the eigen-
values are complex, with the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalue giving the
oscillation frequency and rate of growth or decay (damping ) of the eigenmode. As
for a structural modes, if one is clever enough to excite only a single aerodynamic
eigenmode, then an oscillation will occur whose spatial distribution is given by the
corresponding eigenvector. However, the eigenvalues of an aerodynamic ﬂow are
closely spaced together, typically much more closely than the eigenvalues for struc-
tural modes. Indeed, if the aerodynamic computational domain were extended to
inﬁnity, then the eigenvalues would no longer be discrete but rather would form a
continuous distribution for most aerodynamic ﬂows. Thus, exciting only a single
aerodynamic mode experimentally is a difﬁcult feat. For some turbomachinery ﬂows
with bounded ﬂows between blades in a cascade, discrete well-spaced eigenvalues
are possible that have a resonant character (see Hall et al. [22]). This is also true for
some aerodynamic eigenmodes in a wind tunnel, of course. And these have been
observed experimentally (see Parker [35]).
Aeroelastic modes are those that exist when the structural and aerodynamic modes
are fully coupled; that is, oscillations of a ﬂuid mode excite all structural modes and
vice verse. In general, these aeroelastic modes also have complex eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. At low speeds (well below the ﬂutter speed, for example) one may usu-
ally identify the structural and aerodynamic eigenvalues separately, because struc-
tural/aerodynamic coupling is weak. However, as the ﬂutter speed if approached, the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors may change substantially, and the ﬂuid and structural
modes become more strongly coupled. It is even possible for a mode that is aerody-
namic in origin at low speeds to become the critical ﬂutter mode at higher speeds,
although normally it is one or more of the structural modes that become unstable as
the ﬂow velocity approaches the ﬂutter speed.
Winther et al. [49] have suggested using aeroelastic modes to reduce the total
number of modes to be used in a simulation of overall aircraft motion. This seems
like an idea worth exploring, although aeroelastic modes by deﬁnition vary with
ﬂow condition, that is, dynamic pressure and Mach number, and thus the aeroelastic
modes at one ﬂight condition will not be the aeroelastic modes at another. Of course,
if one uses a sufﬁcient number of aeroelastic modes, they will be able to describe
accurately the system dynamics at any ﬂight condition, but that tends to defeat the
purpose of minimizing the number of modes in the representation.
Also it should be noted that the particular implementation of aeroelastic modes
in Winther et al. [49] does not include aerodynamic states or modes per se, which
limits that particular approach when the aerodynamic modes themselves are active
and couple strongly with the structural modes. This is probably the exceptional case,
but one which can occur.

Representative Results
Dowell et al. [9] have discussed (a) comparisons of the ROM to classical unsteady,
incompressible aerodynamic theory, (b) reduced-order calculations of compressible
unsteady aerodynamics based on the full-potential equation, (c) reduced-order cal-
culations of unsteady ﬂow about an isolated airfoil based on the Euler equations, (d)
reduced-order calculations of unsteady viscous ﬂows associated with cascade stall
ﬂutter, and (e) linear ﬂutter analyses using ROMs.
In the present discussion, recent results for transonic ﬂows with shock waves,
including viscous and nonlinear effects, are emphasized. Before turning to these,
however, we consider some fundamental results concerning the effects of spatial
discretization and a ﬁnite computational domain.
3.13.1
The Effects of Spatial Discretization and A Finite
Computational Domain
For simplicity, we use a classical numerical model, the vortex lattice method, for an
incompressible potential ﬂuid, to illustrate the points we wish to make. Compressible
potential-ﬂow models and Euler ﬂow CFD models have provided numerical results
consistent with those obtained from the vortex lattice models in this regard. The
results discussed here are from Heeg and Dowell [24].
In CFD there are two approximations that are nearly universal to all such models.
One is the construction of a computational grid that determines the limits of spatial
resolution of the computational model. The second is the approximation of an inﬁ-
nite ﬂuid domain by a ﬁnite spatial domain. It is a principal purpose of the present
discussion to note that the computational grid determines not only the spatial reso-
lution obtainable by the CFD model, but also the frequency or temporal resolution
that can be obtained. Further, as is shown, the ﬁniteness of computational domain
determines the resolution of the eigenvalue distribution for a CFD model. Both of
these observations have important ramiﬁcations for assessing the CFD model and its
ability to provide an adequate approximation to the original ﬂuid model on which it
is founded, as well as being helpful in constructing and understanding ROMs.
In the following discussion, we consider both discrete-time and continuous-time
eigenvalues. Even in a high dimensional system such as usually encountered with
CFD,therelationshipbetweenanydynamicalvariable,suchasvortexstrength,veloc-
ity potential, ﬂow velocity, density, pressure, etc, and its time evolution as expressed
for the determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is a simple one. For a given
dynamic variable ˆq, which changes with time t, the eigenvalue relationship from a
time-linearized model is
ˆq = Aeλt,
(14)
where λ is the continuous-time eigenvalue. For a discrete time representation in
which the time step is 
t, we deﬁne the discrete-time eigenvalue z as the ratio of ˆq
to its value one time step earlier. It is easily seen then that

It will be useful in our discussion to consider both λ and z.
Here we use the vortex lattice model, because (a) it is one of the simplest CFD
models, (b) it has been widely used, and (c) among practitioners, it is thought to be
well understood in terms of its capability and limitations. As noted earlier, similar
results are obtained from more elaborate CFD models, which include the effects of
ﬂow compressibility, rotationality, and/or viscosity.
As an example, we consider the ﬂow over an airfoil with a certain number of
vortex elements on the airfoil and in the wake. Initially, we select 20 elements on
the airfoil and 360 elements in the wake. The length of the ﬁnite wake extends 18
chord lengths. The eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the ﬂow can be computed by
now well-established methods for a relatively small eigenvalue system, for example,
< 1000.
The eigenvalue distribution for λ is shown in Fig. 3. Note that the real part of the
eigenvalue is the damping and the imaginary part is the frequency of the eigenvalue.
We now study the effects of (a) reﬁning the vortex lattice grid and (b) changing the

extent of the wake length. Note that, In Fig. 3, the baseline conﬁguration’s eigenvalue
with the largest imaginary part has the value of 10π. When we next halve the element
size while maintaining the same number of wake elements, thus shortening the wake,
the total number of eigenvalues remains constant. However, the frequency range of
the original eigenvalues has doubled. Thus we see that reﬁning the grid has led to
increasing the frequency range of the eigenvalue distribution. The spacing of the
eigenvalues has also increased by about a factor of two. As is seen in the next
paragraph, the latter result is because the computational domain has been reduced
by nearly half, that is, the wake length is shorter.
Now consider what happens as the extent of the wake length is decreased while
the grid spacing is held constant. In Fig. 4, the baseline conﬁguration is compared
to an aerodynamic model that has half as many aerodynamic elements in the wake.
Now we see that the spacing between eigenvalues has increased by about a factor
of two, but the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue distribution (frequency) is
unchanged. Hence, the effect of extending the wake length (for a ﬁxed-grid resolu-
tion) is to reﬁne the resolution of the eigenvalue distribution, but not to change the
maximum frequency of the eigenvalue distribution. A more in-depth interpretation
of this behavior is given by Heeg and Dowell [24] along with further details and
numerical examples.

The Effects of Mach Number and Steady Angle of Attack:
Subsonic and Transonic Flows
Here we examine some recent results from Hall et al. [20] and Thomas et al. [44]
and also Florea et al. [15]. Hall et al. used an Euler equation ﬂow model with a
frequency domain POD method, and Thomas et al. used a transonic potential-ﬂow
model with a now standard eigenvalue, eigenmode formulation. Although different
ﬂow models and modal representations were used, the results of these two studies
lead to similar conclusions regarding the nature of the ﬂow and the efﬁcacy of a
modal representation of the aerodynamic ﬂow.
In Fig. 5, the full eigenvalue spectrum for a ﬂat plate airfoil using a coarse com-
putational grid is shown to elucidate the effects of Mach number from M = 0 to
M = 1.1. These results are from Thomas et al. [44]. Interestingly, the eigenvalue
spectrum changes notably over this range. For M = 0 , all of the eigenvalues are
real and negative. Hence none of the eigenmodes have an oscillatory character. For
any M > 0, however, eigenvalues that are complex conjugates appear along with
real eigenvalues. The eigenvalue pattern continues to evolve as the Mach number
increases, with another signiﬁcant change in character occurring in the transonic

range from M = 0.9 to M = 1.1. The corresponding eigenmodes have also been
determined, including the characteristic pressure distributions on the airfoil. Typi-
cally, the eigenmode that corresponds to the smallest negative real eigenvalue has a
pressure distribution similar to that for steady ﬂow at a constant angle of attack.
As an aside, it is very interesting that the eigenvalues for M = 0 are distributed
along the real axis in Fig. 5, whereas in Fig. 3 they are distributed along the imaginary
axis. In both cases these represent discrete approximation to a branch cut. It is well
known from Theordorsen’s theory for that the branch cut can be placed along a line
emanating from near the origin of the complex plane (see Dowell et al. [8]). The
results of Figs. 3 and 5 indicate that different CFD models for the same physical ﬂow
may place this branch cut along distinctly different rays from the origin. In Fig. 6,
results are shown for a ﬂat plate M = 0.2 and 0.9 and an NACA 0008 airfoil at
M = 0.85. For the latter, a shock is present. Results are shown for a ﬁner mesh that
is typical of CFD calculations, and results are shown from the full eigenspectrum and
those eigenvalues of the ﬂow obtained by using 100 POD modes to construct a ROM.

The POD modes were determined using solutions at discrete values, often called
snapshots in the POD literature, computed at uniformly distributed frequencies in
the range −1.0 < Im[λ] < 1.0. The dominant eigenmodes are well approximated by
the POD/ROM model. Note the characteristic distribution pattern of the eigenvalues
as a function of Mach number, including with and without shock. Further results
have been obtained for an NACA 64A006 airfoil (see Florea et al. [15]). The CFD
grid is shown in Fig. 7, and the steady-ﬂow pressure distribution is shown in Fig. 8.

Note that a shock is distinctly present for M > 0.86. For this airfoil, a bending/torsion
ﬂutter analysis is conducted over the Mach number range M = 0.5 −0.9. The ﬂutter
boundary is shown in Fig. 9. Root loci for the two dominant aeroelastic modes (which
originate in the plunging and pitching structural modes at low Mach number) are
shown in Fig. 10 for Mach numbers in the range M = 0.8 −0.9. These root loci
show that in the Mach number range where the position of the shock on the airfoil
moves appreciably, the critical eigenmode for ﬂutter changes from the plunging
mode to the pitching mode. There is a corresponding and sharp change in the ﬂutter
boundary (cf Fig. 9). One of the beneﬁts of a reduced-order-modal representation
of the aerodynamic ﬂow is the capability and ease of constructing such root loci,
which provide a signiﬁcantly improved understanding of transonic ﬂutter over other
methods of stability analysis, for example, time-marching solutions.

We now turn to some complementary results from Florea et al. [15], who have
studied an NACA 0012 airfoil and an MBB A3 airfoil. We present results only for
the former airfoil here. The grids used for the CFD models are shown in Fig. 11. In
addition to the basic grid, a reﬁned grid in the vicinity of the shock wave was also
considered. In Fig. 12, the steady ﬂow pressure distribution is shown form M = 0.75
and several steady angles of attack. The corresponding eigenvalue distributions are
shown in Fig. 13. Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, the eigenvalue distribution does
not change radically with angle of attack changes, even though the ﬂow at zero angle
of attack is shockless, while that at a 20 angle of attack has a strong shock.
Another comparison of eigenvalue distributions is shown in Fig. 14 where the
angle of attack is held at 0, but a range of Mach numbers is considered. Although
over the full range of Mach numbers the eigenvalue distribution does change, there
is not radical change in the high subsonic, transonic range per se.
Finally, in Fig. 15, a comparison is shown between the results of the full CFD
model (> 5000 degrees of freedom) and those from a ROM. Two different versions of
the ROM are used with 67 and 160 degrees of freedom, respectively. Good correlation
is obtained between the full CFD model and the ROM for lift and moment on an
oscillating airfoil over a wide range of reduced frequencies.
The Effects of Viscosity
Epureanu et al. (2000) have considered the effects of viscosity by using the POD
methodology in the frequency domain. Also see the earlier results by Florea et al. [13]
using the direct eigenvalue approach. The results of Epureanu et al. (2000) are for
a cascade of airfoils. The basic ﬂow model uses a potential description in the outer

inviscid region and a simpliﬁed integral boundary layer model in the inner region.
The solution domain is shown in Figs. 16 and 17. A comparison of results from this
model wit a Navier-Stokes solver has shown reasonable agreement. Comparisons
have also been made with experimental data showing reasonable correlation.
Representative comparisons are shown between the full CFD model and a
POD/ROM in Fig. 18 for a pressure distribution at ﬁxed interblade phase angle
and frequency, in Fig. 19 for lift versus interblade phase angle for a ﬁxed frequency,
and in Fig. 20 for lift versus reduced frequency for a ﬁxed interblade phase angle. The
results are in generally good agreement given the complexity of the ﬂow. A reduc-
tion in degrees of freedom by two orders of magnitude or more is realized for this
example. Note that no more degrees of freedom are required to model viscous ﬂows
than those required for inviscid ﬂows, when considering aerodynamic pressures on
a airfoil.
3.13.3
Nonlinear Aeroelastic Reduced-Order Models
One of the remaining challenges is to construct nonlinear aerodynamic ROMs. An
example of a shock wave undergoing large oscillations in a one-dimensional channel
has been treated by Hall in an as yet unpublished work (KC Hall, unpublished
observations). However, no results from ROMs for ﬂows about an airfoil undergoing
large motions have yet been reported in the literature.

On the other hand, an example wing problem has been examined with a linear
ROM vortex lattice aerodynamic model and a nonlinear structural model for a delta
wing. The details are presented by Tang et al. [43]. Physically, a low Mach number
and small angle of attack ﬂow about a platelike structure undergoing oscillations
on the order of the plate thickness are considered. For a plate, oscillations of this
magnitude give rise to strong geometric structural nonlinearity. The consequence
of this structural nonlinearity is that, once the ﬂutter speed is exceeded, the wing
goes into a limit cycle oscillation (LCO) of bounded amplitude. Of course, a purely
linear aeroelastic model would predict exponentially growing oscillations for ﬂow
conditions beyond the ﬂutter boundary. The use of ROMs for the ﬂuid and structure
makes calculations of this type of LCO practical.

Concluding Remarks and Directions for Future Research
With the construction of ROMs based on rigorous ﬂuid dynamical theory, it is now
possible to (a) provide a practical approach for constructing highly efﬁcient, accurate,
unsteady aerodynamic models suitable for ﬂuid/structure modeling, (b) calculate
true damping and frequency for all coupled ﬂuid/structural (aeroelastic) modes at

What more might the future bring?
Using fully (dynamically) nonlinear models, one should be able to develop rigor-
ous ROMs that will accurately model large and violent aircraft motions, for exam-
ple. For aeroacoustics phenomena in which the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern is of prime
interest, the eigenmode-ROM concept should work well also, but far-ﬁeld boundary
conditions will need special attention for this (or any other) approach. See Hardin
and Hussaini [23] for a discussion of the present state-of-the-art in computational
aeroacoustics. Finally, regarding turbulence and turbulence models, if we use a stan-
dard turbulence model, for example, κ- ϵ, etc, then the present method formally goes
through. However, it is possible that the real value of the eigenmodal ROM approach
will be to encourage the development of better turbulence models.
Is it possible that one could attack the full Navier-Stokes equations using the
eigenmode-ROM methodology? The answer is that in some sense such work
has already begun. The classical hydrodynamic-stability theory is an eigenmode

approach based on the boundary layer approximation combined with a highly sim-
pliﬁed geometry, a ﬂat plate of inﬁnite extent. However, the work per se, now some
50–70 years ago in its origins, did not lead to advances much beyond the limitations
of the classical inﬁnite geometry. Already, models with an outer inviscid model com-
bined with viscous boundary layer theory have been developed, and some encourag-
ing preliminary results are emerging. See Florea et al. [13] and Epureanu et al. 2000.
Thus, one might hope to overcome that classical geometrical limitation and treat the
larger-scale viscous motions about an airfoil or wing with a modern ROM. With these
large-scale motions determined, it might even be possible to reﬁne the eigenmode
representation to determine local ﬂow behavior. Clearly this is only a hypothesis,
but a very intriguing one. It is certainly an open question as to the resolutions of tur-
bulence length scales one may achieve with a given eigenmode or POD expansion.

E. H. Dowell and K. Hall
The recent work of K.Y. Tang et al. [42] on ROMs in low-Reynolds-number ﬂows
using KL or POD modes is interesting in this regard. Also, see the pioneering work
of Holmes et al. [25] discussed in their stimulating book.
Appendix: Singular-Value Decomposition, Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition, and Balanced Modes
Let qn
j be the nth ﬂow variable at some spatial point at some time j where n =
1, 2, ....N and j = 1, 2, ....J. Now from the matrix, ˜Q, as
[ ˜Q] =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
q1
1 . . . q1
J
.
.
.
.
.
.
q N
1 . . . q N
J
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
.
(16)
Again note that total number of time step is J, and the total number of ﬂow
variables is N. For a typical CFD calculation, J might be 1000, and N might be
10000 or more. Hence N is much greater than J.
Now assume a singular value decomposition of ˜Q; that is
˜Q = UVT ,
(17)
where U is a unitary matrix of dimension N × n and V is also a unitary matrix of
dimension J × n. We may select n and typically n will be less than J. Note that
[UT U] = [I]n×n
,
[VT V] = [I]n×n,
(18)
and  is a diagonal matrix of singular values; that is,
[] =
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
σ1
σ2
.
σn
⎤
⎥⎥⎦.
(19)
We order these singular values such that
σ1 ≥σ2 ≥..... ≥σn.
(20)
Now form , the correlation matrix for the POD method:
 = ˜QT ˜Q = VT UT UVT = VT VT .
(21)

Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction
475
Equation 21 implies that V is the eigenvector of the correlation matrix and the cor-
responding eigenvalues are the squares of the singular values.
From Eq. 17, one may computer (assuming that V is normalized so that the
magnitude of each eigenvector is unity),
˜QV = UVT V = U.
(22)
One may also compute U from Eq. 22, and further one may compute ˜Q from a
knowledge of U, V, and the singular values using Eq. 17. Usually it is easier to
compute ˜Q directly from Eq. 16, however. The representation of Eq. 17 may be
useful if we choose to decompose ˜Q such that
˜Q(U
1
2 )(
1
2 VT ).
(23)
With this decomposition the POD modes are said to be “balanced,” and these are
often put forth as an optimum choice for mode selection.
If there is a truncation in the singular values, that is, if we choose n to be less than
J which is much less than N, then Eq. 17 may be written in a reduced form. The
corresponding reduced form for ˜Q approaches the original ˜Q if the neglected singular
values or POD eigenvalues are sufﬁciently small compared with those retained.
Denoting V as the eigenvector matrix for the correlation matrix of dimension
J × n, noting that ˜Q is a matrix N × J, and deﬁning a as the new unknowns to be
determined, which are the n modal amplitudes of the POD modes, then one may
write the original ﬂow variables, q, as
{q(t)}N×1 = [ ˜Q]N×J[V]J×n{a}n×1.
(24)
Substituting this expression into Eq. 5 of the main text, that is,
∂
∂t {q} = {Q(q)} + {B}u,
(25)
and premultiplying by the transpose of ˜Q [ V ] gives a ROM in terms of the new
unknowns a, where the dimension of the vector a is n × 1 with n chosen to be less than
J. For simplicity, in Eq. 25, only a single scalar input, u, is shown. The generalization
to multiple inputs is clear. If Q(q) in Eq. 25 is expanded in a Taylor series about a
steady-ﬂow solution (the time-linearized model corresponds to retaining only linear
terms in q in the Taylor series), then a particularly simple and attractive form of the
ROM is obtained.
There is another interesting case to consider which may arise when experimental
data rather than numerical data from a CFD code are used to construct a ROM. In this
case the number of low variables that are observed or measured, N, will be relatively
small and typically N will be less than J, the total number of time steps for which

data are obtained. Formally the calculation still goes through, but now the number
of ﬂow variables modeled is much smaller than for a CFD code. Ideally these ﬂow
variables would be related to the amplitudes of the dominant modes of the ﬂow.

Experimental Aeroelasticity
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract This is a brief account of the basic elements underlying experiments in
Aeroelasticity.
Much of this text has been devoted to mathematical modeling of physical phenomena
in the ﬁeld of aeroelasticity. Yet one of the most challenging and important aspects
of the subject is the conduct of physical experiments. Experiments are useful for
many purposes, e.g. to assess the accuracy and validity of theoretical models, to
study phenomena beyond the current reach of theory, and/or to verify the safety and
integrity of aeroelastic systems through wind tunnel tests or ﬂight tests. A thorough
expositionofthistopicwouldrequireavolumeinitself.Hereafewofthefundamental
aspects of experimental aeroelasticity are discussed. The focus is on aeroelastic tests
per se rather than structural dynamic tests or unsteady aerodynamic measurements.
However the latter will be touched on as well insofar as they are relevant to our
principal topic.
For authoritative treatment of this subject the discussion by Ricketts [1] is highly
recommended.
Before an aeroelastic experiment is conducted, it is usual to make measurements
of the natural modes and frequencies of the structural model. Hence our discussion
begins there.

Review of Structural Dynamics Experiments
In the jargon of the practitioners, these are referred to as ground vibration tests or
GVT. The basic requirements are a means for exciting (forcing) the structure into
its resonant, natural modes and also a means for measuring the response of the
structure. For excitation systems a variety of devices have been used including those
that provide mechanical forces, electromagnetic forces and acoustical excitation.

The choice of excitation depends primarily upon the level of force required and the
range of frequency to be covered. For lightly damped systems excited in a resonant
mode, the force level needed can be estimated as the mass of the structure times the
frequency squared times (twice) the critical damping ratio times the amplitude of
response required, i.e. the inertial and stiffness terms nearly cancel and the excit-
ing force is balanced by structural dissipation or damping. The response amplitude
required is typically determined by the sensitivity of available response measurement
instrumentation or perhaps the need for the response to be in a certain linear (or less
usually, nonlinear) range of response.
In practical terms mechanical excitation systems are used for low frequencies (say
1–100 Hz), electromagnetic exciters (shakers) are used for moderate frequencies (say
10–1000 Hz) and acoustic excitation at high frequencies (say 100–10000 Hz).
The response measurement systems may be either mechanical (strain gauges or
accelerometers), electromagnetic (some electromagnetic devices may be used as
either exciters or response measurement devices) or, more recently piezoelectric
devices1 that may be used to either serve as exciter or responder.
Thebasicmeasurementtechniqueistoexcitethesystematitsresonantfrequencies
(usually having theoretical calculations as a guide) with the excitation and response
devices placed at locations on the structure expected to have large response. Multi-
ple exciters are used to distinguish between symmetric and anti-symmetric natural
modes or to excite modes with complex shapes. In principle, a continuous distribu-
tion of excitation with a distribution of force amplitude proportional to the expected
(mass weighted) natural mode (and therefore orthogonal to all other natural modes)
is optimum. Rarely can so many exciters be used in practice to approach this ideal.
If a pure frequency excitation is used, then a transient decay time history or a half-
power frequency response plot may be used to estimate modal natural frequency and
damping (e.g. see Thomson2 or any standard text on vibration theory).
Also a random excitation over the range of relevant frequencies may be used
to identify multiple modes with one excitation. This is used only when test time
is limited. Another possibility is pulse excitation in the time domain and the use
of Fast Fourier transform theory to extract information on multiple natural modes.
Commercial hardware and software is now widely available to perform the latter
measurement.3 However for precise work the old fashioned methods may still be
preferred.
Of course, if any signiﬁcant nonlinearities are present, nonlinear theory must be
used to guide the form of excitation, measurement and data interpretation. The range
of possibilities is too extensive to be easily summarized. But the presence of higher
harmonics in the response measurement is often a key observation that suggests
nonlinearities are present and important.

Wind Tunnel Experiments
With the presence of ﬂow the environment for excitation and measurement of
response is more complex, but the basic devices for creating, measuring and inter-
preting the responses remain the same as for the simpler structural dynamics exper-
iments. Sometimes the aerodynamic turbulence in the tunnel is used to provide a
random excitation and, of course, for self-excited instabilities (e.g. ﬂutter) no special
requirements are (in principle) necessary to excite the aeroelastic system. Never-
theless, where practicable, it is desirable to have an excitation system available of
the conventional sort, e.g. mechanical, electromagnetic, acoustic, or perhaps, piezo-
electric. Such excitations allow one to conduct sub-critical response experiments(i.e.
experiments conducted below the ﬂutter boundary). One of the principal challenges
in ﬂutter testing is to be able to extrapolate to ﬂutter (critical) conditions from sub-
critical measurements.
2.1
Sub-critical Flutter Testing
By monitoring the change of modal damping with change in ﬂow dynamic pressure,
for example, one may try to anticipate the value of dynamic pressure for which
the modal damping will become zero and then negative. However, because of the
sometimes complicated and rapid variation of damping with dynamic pressure and
the necessity to monitor several potentially critical modes, it is often difﬁcult to
extrapolate to this ﬂutter condition. Indeed extrapolation techniques for this purpose
remain an active area of research.4
For certain types of ﬂutter, monitoring the changes in modal frequencies may also
be a useful guide to help predict the onset of ﬂutter.
2.2
Approaching the Flutter Boundary
For low speed (incompressible ﬂow) ﬂutter tests, the ﬂutter boundary is normally
approached by increasing the ﬂow velocity in suitable increments. For high speed
(compressible ﬂow) ﬂutter tests, the Mach number is normally ﬁxed, and the ﬂutter
boundary is approached by increasing the wind tunnel stagnation pressure, and hence
dynamic pressure, in suitable increments. Then the Mach number is changed and the
process repeated. At very high Mach numbers, a blow-down (transient ﬂow) wind
tunnel may be the only ﬂow facility available. However, a continuous ﬂow, closed
return tunnel is to be preferred when available in order to assure well deﬁned ﬂow
conditions and give adequate time for accurate response measurements.
4 See Matsuzaki [4].

482
E. H. Dowell
2.3
Safety Devices
Normally some provision will be made for suppression of the ﬂutter response by
a rapidly applied restraint to the ﬂutter model, in order to protect the model from
damage due to ﬂutter.
2.4
Research Tests Versus Clearance Tests
Research tests are normally conducted to provide experimental data for comparison
with theory and hence usually rather detailed data sets are obtained over a wide
range of ﬂow and/or structural parameters. Clearance tests are designed simply to
show a particular ﬂutter model is unlikely to encounter an instability over a range of
anticipated operational conditions.
2.5
Scaling Laws
By expressing the aeroelastic equations of motion in non-dimensional form or by
simply using dimensional analyses, it is possible to relate the behavior of the small
scale models typically tested in wind tunnels so that of full-scale aircraft in ﬂight.5
Often not all relevant non-dimensional parameters can be matched between tunnel
scale and ﬂight scale due to the imitations of modal fabrication and wind tunnel
ﬂow conditions. Selecting an appropriate set of scaling parameters is a matter of
intelligent application of theory (i.e. matching those non-dimensional parameters
that are most important and sensitive as predicted by analysis) and judgement based
uponexperience.Normallymodalfrequencyratios,reducedfrequency,Machnumber
and a non-dimensional ratio of dynamic pressure to model stiffness are matched.
Frequently ﬂuid/structural mass ratio is not.
Wind tunnel tests are extraordinarily valuable and often ﬁll in gaps in our knowl-
edge where theory is unavailable or unreliable.
3
Flight Experiments
Virtually all the previous comments for wind tunnel tests apply to ﬂight tests as
well. However the need for safety is now paramount and the challenges of providing
a well deﬁned excitation force are considerably higher. Also the test procedure is
necessarily different.
5 See Dugundji and Calligeros for a particularly valuable discussion [5].

3.1
Approaching the Flutter Boundary
Normally the ﬂutter boundary has been estimated from a suitable combination of
analysis and wind tunnel experiment prior to the ﬂight test and presented in terms
of altitude (corresponding to a certain static or dynamic pressure) vs Mach number.
Usually the Mach number at which ﬂutter will occur increases with increasing alti-
tude. Hence ﬂutter testing normally begins at high altitude (this also provides more
margin for emergency procedures including the pilot leaving the aircraft). At ﬁxed
altitude the Mach number is increased in small increments until ﬂutter occurs or the
maximum Mach number capability of the aircraft is reached.
When is ﬂight ﬂutter testing required?
For new aircraft, for substantial modiﬁcations of existing aircraft and for new uses
of an existing aircraft, ﬂutter testing is usually required.
3.2
Excitation
Several excitation methods have been proposed and used. None are clearly superior.
Use of existing hardware, e.g. control stick raps, electronic inputs to the control
system, or atmospheric turbulence, obviously minimize cost. On the other hand, add-
ondevices,suchasoscillatingvanes,inertialmassoscillations,orpyrotechnicdevices
presumably give greater control and range to the excitation. The rotating slotted
cylinder device proposed by Reed6 shows promise of being a good compromise
between cost and performance. Examples of excitation systems that have been used
in practice are shown in Fig.1.7
3.3
Examples of Recent Flight Flutter Test Programs
To remind the reader of the danger inherent in such tests, Fig.2 shows the loss of a
substantial portion of the tail surface from the recent ﬂutter testing of the F-117A

The Role of Experimentation and Theory in Design
In designing a new aircraft with acceptable aeroelastic behavior, a synergistic com-
bination of theory, wind tunnel tests and ﬂight tests is normally employed. Here a
brief overview is presented of how this is usually done.
One measure of the relative importance of each of these synergistic elements is
their cost. Baird8 has estimated these for the F-14 aircraft. See Table II (Fig.4).
In Table III (Fig.5) a ﬂow chart is shown that indicates the interaction among
these elements. Note that each element normally inﬂuences another. For example,
analysis and wind tunnel tests help deﬁne the ﬂight ﬂutter test program. Conversely
any anomalies determined during ﬂight test will almost assuredly lead to additional
analysis and wind tunnel tests.

Finally, although the emphasis here has been on ﬂutter experiments, gust response
experiments or static aeroelastic behavior may be the subject of tests as well. The
techniques employed are similar to those for ﬂutter, with pilot and aircraft safety
usually not as much a critical concern as with ﬂutter tests.

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract This is an introduction and overview of the work that has been done in
nonlinear aeroelasticity prior to the last decade. Many of the issues discussed here are
still under active investigation. Of particular interest are the limit cycle oscillations
that may occur once the dynamic stability (ﬂutter) boundary has been exceeded.

Introduction
Nonlinear aeroelasticity has been a subject of high interest for the last decade and
the literature is now extensive.1 An account of the state of the art is provided as
of this writing with an emphasis on key ideas and results. These demonstrate our
current theoretical, computational and experimental capabilities and the degree to
which correlation among results from these several approaches agree or disagree.
An exhaustive literature survey is not attempted here; however a bibliography of
over eight hundred citations is available in electronic form from the ﬁrst author upon
request. The particular results and methods described must inevitably reﬂect the
authors’ knowledge and experience, but we have made an effort to be comprehensive
in terms of ideas and representative with respect to results.
The chapter begins with a discussion of generic nonlinear aeroelastic behavior
especially as it relates to Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO); then the important studies
that come from ﬂight experience with LCO are noted which have stimulated much of
the other research on the subject. Next a summary is provided of the primary physical
sources of ﬂuid and structural nonlinearities that can lead to nonlinear aeroelastic
response in general and LCO more particularly.
A broad overview of unsteady aerodynamic models, both linear and nonlinear,
is then given before turning to the heart of the chapter that provides a critique of

the results obtained to date via various methods, using as a framework correlations
between theory and experiment or alternative theoretical models. For these correla-
tions unsteady aerodynamic forces per se, ﬂutter boundaries and limit cycle oscilla-
tions are each considered in turn. For limit cycle oscillations (1) airfoils with stiffness
nonlinearities, (2) delta wings with geometrical plate nonlinearities, (3) very high
aspect ratio wings with both structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities, (4) nonlinear
structural damping and (5) aerodynamic ﬂows with large shock motions and ﬂow
separation are each discussed. A brief mention is also made of recent studies of active
control of nonlinear aeroelastic systems.
The chapter concludes with a summary of major lessons learned by the research
and development community to date and offers suggestions for future work that
appear particularly attractive at this time.

Generic Nonlinear Aeroelastic Behavior
There are several basic concepts that will be helpful for the reader to keep in mind
throughout the discussion to follow. The ﬁrst is the distinction between a static non-
linearity and a dynamic one. In the aeroelasticity literature the term “linear system”
may either mean a (mathematical or wind tunnel) model or ﬂight vehicle that is both
statically and dynamically linear in its response or one that is nonlinear in its static
response, but linear in its dynamic response. So we will usually qualify the term
“linear model” further by noting whether the system is dynamically linear or both
statically and dynamically, i.e. wholly, linear.
An example of a system which is wholly linear is a structure whose deformation to
either static or dynamic forces is (linearly) proportional to those forces. An aerody-
namic ﬂow is wholly linear when the response (say change in pressure) is (linearly)
proportional to changes in downwash or ﬂuid velocities induced by shape or motion
of a solid body in the ﬂow. This is the domain of classical small perturbation aerody-
namic theory and leads to a linear mathematical model (convected wave equation)
for the ﬂuid pressure perturbation or velocity potential. Shock waves and separated
ﬂow are excluded from such ﬂow models that are both statically and dynamically
linear. A wholly linear aeroelastic model is of course one composed of wholly linear
structural and aerodynamic models.
A statically nonlinear, but dynamically linear structure is one where the static
deformations are sufﬁciently large that the static response is no longer proportional
to the static forces and the responses to the static and dynamic forces cannot be simply
be added to give meaningful results. Buckled skin panels (buckling is a nonlinear
static equilibrium that arises from a static instability) that dynamically respond to (not
too large) acoustic loads or the prediction of the onset of their dynamic aeroelastic
instability (ﬂutter) are examples where a statically nonlinear, but dynamically linear
model may be useful.
In aerodynamic ﬂows, shock waves and separated ﬂows are themselves the result
of a dynamically nonlinear process. But once formed they may often be treated in

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
491
the aeroelastic context as part of a nonlinear static equilibrium state (steady ﬂow).
Then the question of the dynamic stability of the statically nonlinear ﬂuid-structural
(aeroelastic) system may be addressed by a linear dynamic perturbation analysis
about this nonlinear static equilibrium. Sometime such aerodynamic ﬂow models
are call time linearized.
Of course if one wishes to model nonlinear limit cycle oscillations and the growth
of their amplitude as ﬂow parameters are changed, then either or both the struc-
tural and the aerodynamic model must be treated as dynamically nonlinear. Often a
single nonlinear mechanism is primarily responsible for the limit cycle oscillation.
However, one may not know a priori which nonlinearity is dominant unless one has
designed a mathematical model, wind tunnel model or ﬂight vehicle with the chosen
nonlinearity. Not the least reason why limit cycle oscillations are more difﬁcult to
understand in ﬂight vehicles (compared to say mathematical models) is that rarely
has a nonlinearity been chosen and designed into the vehicle. More often one is deal-
ing with an unanticipated and possibly unwanted nonlinearity. Yet sometimes that
nonlinearity is welcome because without it the limit cycle oscillation would instead
be replaced by catastrophic ﬂutter leading to loss of the ﬂight vehicle.
It must be emphasized that the variety of possible nonlinear aeroelastic response
behaviors is not limited to ‘Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO)’ per se. In the context of
nonlinear system theory [1], an LCO is one of the simplest dynamic bifurcations, a
‘ﬁrst stopontheroadtochaos,’ sotospeak. Other commonpossiblebehaviors include
higher harmonic and subharmonic resonances, jump-resonances, entrainment, beat-
ing (which can be due to either linear or nonlinear coupling), and period doubling to
name only a few. These behaviors have been delineated and studied using low order
model problems in the nonlinear dynamics literature; however in aeroelastic wind
tunnel and ﬂight testing, the detailed knowledge required to identify these nonlinear
behaviors has rarely been available. Also, experience indicates that the concept of
LCO is a good general description for many nonlinear aeroelastic behaviors. Thus,
we will limit ourselves herein to the use of the generic term, LCO, acknowledging
that this is an oversimpliﬁcation.
Now let us turn to the generic types of nonlinear dynamic response that may occur,
i.e. limit cycle oscillations and the variation of their amplitude with ﬂight speed (or
wind tunnel velocity). Of course the frequency of the LCO may vary with ﬂight
parameters as well, but usually the frequency is near that predicted by a classical
linear dynamic stability (ﬂutter) analysis.
The generic possibilities are indicated in Fig.1 where the limit cycle amplitude
is plotted verses some system parameter, e.g. ﬂight speed. In Fig.1a, an aeroelastic
system is depicted that is stable to small or large disturbances (perturbations) below
the ﬂutter (instability) boundary predicted by a linear dynamical model. Beyond the
ﬂutter boundary, LCO arise due to some nonlinear effect and typically the amplitude
of the LCO increases as the ﬂight speed increases beyond the ﬂutter speed. In Fig.1b,
the other generic possibility is shown. While again LCO exist beyond the ﬂutter
boundary, now LCO may also exist below the ﬂutter boundary, if the disturbances
to the system are sufﬁciently large. Moreover both stable (solid line) and unstable
(dotted line) LCO now are present. Stable LCO exist when for any sufﬁciently small

492

Fig. 1 Schematic of Limit Cycle Oscillation response
disturbance, the motion returns to the same LCO at large time. Unstable LCO are
those for which any small perturbation will cause the motion to move away from the
unstable LCO and move toward a stable LCO. Theoretically, in the absence of any
disturbance both stable and unstable LCO are possible dynamic, steady state motions
of the system. Information about the size of the disturbance required to move from
one stable LCO to another can also be obtained from data such as shown in Fig.1b.
Note also the hysteretic response as ﬂight speed increases and then decreases.

Flight Experience with Nonlinear Aeroelastic Effects
Much of the ﬂight experience with aircraft has been documented by the Air Force
Flight Test Center at Eglin AFB and is described in several publications by Denegri
and his colleagues, [3–6]. Most of this work has been in the context of the F-16 air-
craft. Denegri distinguishes among three types of LCO based upon the phenomeno-
logical observations in ﬂight and as informed by classical linear ﬂutter analysis.
“Typical LCO” is when the LCO begins at a certain ﬂight condition and then with
say an increase in Mach number at constant altitude the LCO response smoothly
increases. “Flutter”, as distinct from LCO, is said to occur when the increase in LCO
amplitude with change in Mach number is so rapid that the safety of the vehicle is in
question. And ﬁnally “atypical LCO” is said to occur when the LCO amplitude ﬁrst
increases and then decreases and perhaps disappears with changes in Mach number.
Often changes in ﬂight vehicle angle of attack lead to similar generic LCO responses
to those observed with changes in Mach number.
It has long been recognized [7] that the addition of external stores to aircraft
changes the dynamic characteristics and may adversely affect ﬂutter boundaries.
Limit cycle oscillations (LCO) remain a persistent problem on high performance
ﬁghter aircraft with multiple store conﬁgurations. Using measurements obtained

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
493
from ﬂight tests, Bunton and Denegri [8] describe LCO characteristics of the F-16
and F/A-18 aircraft. While LCO can be present in any sort of nonlinear system, in
the context of aeroelasticity, LCO typically is exhibited as an oscillatory torsional
response of the wing, the amplitude of which is limited, but dependent on the nature
of the nonlinearity as well as ﬂight conditions, such as speed, altitude, and Mach
number. The LCO motion is often dominated by antisymmetric modes. LCO are
not described by standard linear aeroelastic analysis, and they may occur at ﬂight
conditions below those at which linear instabilities such as ﬂutter are predicted.
Although the amplitude of the LCO may be above structural failure limits, more
typically the presence of LCOs results in a reduction in vehicle performance, leads to
airframe-limiting structural fatigue, and compromises the ability of pilots to perform
critical mission-related tasks. When LCO are unacceptable for ﬂight performance,
extensive and costly ﬂight tests for aircraft/store certiﬁcation are required.
Denegri [3, 4] suggests that for the F-16, the frequencies of LCO might be identi-
ﬁed by linear ﬂutter analysis; however, linear analysis fails to predict the oscillation
amplitude or the onset velocity for LCO. No deﬁnitive theory has been forwarded to
explain completely the mechanisms responsible for F-16 LCO. Denegri notes that
while linear techniques have been used to predict the frequency of LCOs, linear
analysis cannot consistently predict where within the ﬂight envelope the onset of
the oscillations will occur. Thus, nonlinear analysis will be necessary to predict the
onset of the LCO and their amplitudes with changing ﬂight conditions. Such non-
linear analysis would be a useful and valuable tool for reducing the amount of ﬂight
testing necessary for aircraft/store certiﬁcation.
3.1
Nonlinear Aerodynamic Effects
There are several other ﬂight experiences with limit cycle oscillations in addition to
the F-16 including those for example with the F-18, the B-1 and B-2. Most of these
LCO have been attributed by a majority of investigators to nonlinear aerodynamic
effects due to shock wave motion and/or separated ﬂow. However, there is the possi-
bility that nonlinear structural effects involving stiffness, damping or freeplay may
play a role as well. Indeed, much of the present day research and development effort
is devoted to clarifying the basic mechanisms responsible for nonlinear ﬂutter and
LCO. For an authoritative discussion of these issues see Cunningham et al., [9–11];
Denegri et al. [3–6] on the F-16 and F-18, Dobbs et al. [12]; Hartwich et al. [13] on
the B-1 and Dreim et al., [14] on the B-2. Recent experimental evidence from wind
tunnel tests is beginning to shed further light on these matters as are advances in
mathematical and computational modeling.
In addition to the above studies, many aircraft with freeplay in their control sur-
faces have experienced LCO as well.

There have been any number of aircraft that have experienced ﬂutter induced limit
cycle oscillations as a result of control surface freeplay. Not surprisingly perhaps
these are not well documented in the public literature, but are more known by word
of mouth among practitioners and perhaps documented in internal company reports
and/or restricted government ﬁles.
A recent and notable exception is the account in Aviation Week and Space Tech-
nology [15] of a ﬂutter/limit cycle oscillation as a result of freeplay. In many ways
this account is typical. The oscillation is of limited amplitude and there was a reported
disagreement between the manufacturer and the regulating governmental agency as
to whether this oscillation was or was not sufﬁciently large as to be a threat to the
structural integrity of the aircraft structure.
3.3
Geometric Structural Nonlinearities
Another not infrequently encountered and documented case is the limit cycle oscil-
lation that follows the onset of ﬂutter in plate-like structures. The structure has a
nonlinear stiffening as a result of the tension induced by mid-plane stretching of
the plate that arises from its lateral bending. This is most commonly encountered in
what is often called panel ﬂutter where a local element of a wing or fuselage skin
encounters ﬂutter and then a limit cycle oscillation. There have been many incidents
reported in the literature dating back to the V-2 rocket of World War II, the X-15,
the Saturn Launch Vehicle of the Apollo program and continuing on to the present
day. Some of these are discussed in a monograph by Dowell [16] and also a NASA
Special Publication Dowell [17].
It has been recently recognized that low aspect ratio wings may behave as struc-
tural plates and the entire wing may undergo a form of plate-like ﬂutter and limit
cycle oscillations. This has been seen in both wind tunnel models and computations.
However there is not yet a clearly documented case of such behavior in ﬂight.
4
Physical Sources of Nonlinearities
These have been identiﬁed through mathematical models (in almost all cases), wind
tunnel tests (in several cases) and ﬂight tests (less often). Among those most com-
monly studied and thought to be among the more important are the following. Large
shock motions may lead to a nonlinear relationship between the motion of the struc-
ture and the resulting aerodynamic pressures and forces that act on the structure. If the
ﬂow is separated (perhaps in part induced by the shock motion) this may also create

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
495
a nonlinear relationship between structural motion and the consequent aerodynamic
ﬂow ﬁeld.
Structural nonlinearities can also be important and are the result of a given (aero-
dynamic) force on the structure creating a response that is no longer (linearly) propor-
tional to the applied force. Freeplay and geometric nonlinearities are prime examples
(already mentioned). But the internal damping forces in a structure may also have a
nonlinear relationship to structural motion, with dry friction being an example that
has received some attention. Because the structural damping is usually represented
empirically even within the framework of linear aeroelastic mathematical models,
not much is known about the fundamental mechanisms of damping and their impact
on ﬂutter and LCO.
All of these nonlinear mechanisms have nevertheless received attention by the
mathematical modeling community and several have been the subject of wind tunnel
tests as well. In some cases good correlation between theory and experiment has
been obtained for limit cycle oscillation response.

Efﬁcient Computation of Unsteady Aerodynamic Forces:
Linear and Nonlinear
The literature on unsteady aerodynamic forces alone is quite extensive. A compre-
hensive assessment of current practice in industry is given by Yurkovich, Liu and
Chen [18]. An article that focuses on recent developments is that of Dowell and Hall
[19]. They also developed a bibliography of some ﬁve hundred items available in
electronic form from the authors. Other recent and notable discussions include those
of Bennett and Edwards [20] and Beran and Silva [21]. Much of the present focus
of work on unsteady aerodynamics is on developing accurate and efﬁcient compu-
tational models. Standard computational ﬂuid dynamic [CFD] models that include
the relevant ﬂuid nonlinearities are simply too expensive now and for some time to
come for most aeroelastic analyses. Thus there has been much interest in reducing
computational costs while retaining the essence of the nonlinear ﬂow phenomena.
There are three basic ideas that are currently being pursued with some success in
retaining the accuracy associated with state-of-the-art CFD models while reducing
aerodynamic model size and computational cost, [19, 21]. One is to consider a small
(linear) dynamic perturbation about a (nonlinear) mean steady ﬂow. The steady ﬂow
may include both the effects of a shock wave and ﬂow separation, but any shock or
ﬂow separation region motion is considered in the dynamically linear approximation.
That is, it is assumed that the shock motion or the separation point motion, for
example, is linearly proportional to the motion of the structure. This is sufﬁcient
to assess the linear stability of the aeroelastic system, but not to determine LCO
amplitudes due to nonlinear aerodynamic effects. Of course in those cases where
the structural nonlinearities are dominant, this simpler aerodynamic model is all one
needs to determine LCO. This approach has enormous computational advantages as

496
E. H. Dowell
the computational cost is comparable to that of a steady ﬂow CFD model since the
unsteady calculation per se uses a linear model. And if a structural parameter study
is conducted to determine the ﬂutter boundary, the computational cost is no more
than for classical aerodynamic methods.
Moreover this approach can be extended to NONLINEAR unsteady ﬂows by
expanding the ﬂow solution in terms of a Fourier series in time. This assumes the
ﬂow motion is periodic in time of course and is most effective if the number of
important harmonics needed in the Fourier Series is small. However this is true of
many (but not all) ﬂows of interest. Here the computational cost is a small multiple
(say a factor of three) of the cost of a steady ﬂow solution. This is the second major
idea, and the harmonic balance method is much faster for determining the LCO than
a time marching methods typically by one to two orders of magnitude.
The third major idea is to determine the dominant spatial modes of the ﬂow ﬁeld
and use these, rather than many local grid points, to represent the ﬂow. This is a class
of so called Reduced Order Models. The reduction is from the very large number
of local grid points (on the order of a million or more) to a small number of spatial
modes (typically less than one hundred). The reduction in computational cost for
aeroelastic analysis is several orders of magnitude, i.e., a factor of one thousand or
more. This approach has been used for potential ﬂow, Euler ﬂow and Navier-Stokes
ﬂows (with a turbulence model) for small dynamic perturbations about a nonlinear
mean steady ﬂow (recall the ﬁrst major idea discussed above). Current research
is underway to consider nonlinear unsteady ﬂows. Kim and Bussoletti [22] have
discussed how one can construct an optimal reduced-order aeroelastic model within
the framework of time linearized CFD models. While in principle ﬂuid eigenmodes
can be used, and indeed they provide the underlying framework for reduced order
modeling, the technique known as proper orthogonal decomposition has proven to be
the most computationally attractive method for constructing a set of global modes for
the reduced order model. With a reduced order model, the aeroelastic computations
are no more expensive than using classical aerodynamics. Moreover one can compute
the true aeroelastic damping and frequency of each system mode.
A parallel approach to the last idea is to use the ideas of transfer functions (some-
times called describing function s in the nonlinear case) in the frequency domain or
Volterra series in the time domain to create small computational models from large
CFD codes [19, 21]. In this approach the form of the transfer function or describing
function (or its time series equivalent) is assumed and the coefﬁcients of the reduced
order model are determined from data generated by the CFD code in a time simu-
lation. A good discussion of this approach is contained in Beran and Silva [21] and
in a series of papers by Silva [23–28]. Again this approach is most fully developed
for the dynamically linear case and the dynamically nonlinear case is currently a
subject of active research. Raveh, Levy and Karpel [29] have offered a recent and
useful discussion of how these ideas can be implemented within the framework of
an Euler based, CFD model and provided an example of the well studied AGARD
445.6 wing. Also see Raveh [30].
All of these ideas, individually or in combination, provide the promise of dramatic
reductions in computational costs for unsteady transonic ﬂows including the effects

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
497
of shock motion and ﬂow separation. In addition progress continues to be made in
improving the computational efﬁciency of time marching simulations Farhat et al.
[31, 32]. And the ideas of dynamic (time) linearization and reduced order modeling
can be used in either the time or frequency domains. For a more thorough discussion
of these ideas, see chapter“Modeling of Fluid-Structure Interaction”.

Correlations of Experiment/Theory and Theory/Theory
Much of what we know about the state of the art with respect to nonlinear aeroe-
lasticity comes from the study of correlations between experiment and theory and
between various levels of theoretical models. Hence the remainder of this chapter
is largely devoted to such correlations and the lessons learned from them. The cor-
relations selected are to the best of our knowledge representative of the state of the
art. We shall consider correlations for aerodynamic forces per se, transonic ﬂutter
boundaries, and limit cycle oscillations.
6.1
Aerodynamic Forces
Roughen, Baker and Fogarty [33] have compared the results of several theoretical
models with the experimental data from the Benchmark Active Controls Technology
(BACT) wing. The BACT wing is a rectangular planform with a NACA 0012 airfoil
proﬁle. The model has a trailing edge control surface extending from 45–75% span.
PreviouslySchusteretal.[34]hadcomparedresultsfromaNavier-StokesCFDmodel
(ENS3DAE) to these experimental data. Roughen et al. used an alternative Navier-
Stokes CFD model (CFL3D) and also a classical potential ﬂow model (Doublet
Lattice). Correlations were made at several subsonic to transonic Mach numbers. As
they note.
“Forthepurelysubsoniccondition(M=0.65)....thereisrelativelygoodagreement
between the doublet-lattice results, the Navier-Stokes results and the test data. This
is not surprising because the ﬂow is entirely subsonic and well behaved (there is no
shockwaveandnoﬂowseparation).”HoweveratM=0.77“transoniceffectsbeginto
become apparent in these results. For the most part, the observations about the results
and the qualitative correlation between doublet lattice, Navier-Stokes, and experi-
mental results are similar to the subsonic results. However, there are some important
differences that appear in the neighborhood of the supersonic pocket (near the mild
and relatively weak shock wave).....There is clearly a bump in the unsteady pressure
magnitude (near the shock wave position).....Little nonlinear amplitude dependence
is seen (however) except near the trailing edge.”
For M = 0.82 there is a strong shock near 40% chord. “The presence of the shock
is also clearly evident in the steady-state pressure distribution shown in Fig.2. The
effects of the shock are also quite obvious in the unsteady pressure results. See Fig.3.

498
E. H. Dowell
Fig. 2 Steady state pressure distribution for BACT odel
In the unsteady pressure magnitudes, there is a clear peak in the unsteady pressure at
approximately 35% local chord in the experimental results and at 40% local chord
in the Navier-Stokes results. The peak, which represents the shock doublet Ashley
[35] caused by the unsteady motion of the shock, is absent in the linear doublet
lattice results [N5K code]. Quantitatively, the correlation of the shock doublet peak
between experimental and Navier-Stokes results is disappointing. The CFD results
predict a shock doublet of approximately double the amplitude of that seen in the
experimental results.... possible contributors to this inaccuracy (in the theory) are the
chordwise grid resolution and the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model. Correlation
between CFD solutions and the experiment is excellent away from ...the shock.”
More recent calculations for this conﬁguration have improved the quantitative
results from the CFD mathematical models, but not wholly resolved the differences
between theory and experiment at the highest Mach number, M = 0.82. See the valu-
able and insightful discussion of results using the CFL3D and ENS3DAE computer
models by Bartels and Schuster [36].
Another valuable correlation among several theoretical results and that of exper-
iment is based upon the experimental work of Davis and Malcolm [37]. Several
investigators have compared the results of transonic potential ﬂow and Euler ﬂow
models with these experimental data. A NACA 64A010A airfoil was studied, again
in the high subsonic/transonic Mach number range.
See Fig.4 for a comparison
of lift and moment magnitude and phase for a pitching airfoil. As can be seen the
general trends are well predicted by all theories with the Euler model being in some-
what better agreement with the experimental data overall. The most recent Euler
results were obtained using the Harmonic Balance method and the number of data
points calculated were correspondingly more numerous. For this comparison the
mean angle of attack of the airfoil was a 0 degrees. However Davis and Malcolm
also considered a mean angle of attack of 4 degrees for which the ﬂow is separated
and results for the magnitude of the unsteady lift are shown in Fig.5 for both mean
angles of attack as a function of the amplitude of the oscillating or unsteady angle of

attack. What is immediately clear is that for the mean angle of attack of zero there
is a signiﬁcant range of unsteady angle of attack for which the aerodynamic ﬂow
is dynamically linear. However that range is much smaller when the mean angle of
attack is increased to 4 degrees and the ﬂow is separated. Results from both potential
ﬂow and Euler ﬂow models correlate well with the experiment for a mean angle
of attack of 0 degrees when the ﬂow is attached, but not for the case of a mean
angle of attack of 4 degrees when the ﬂow is separated. It would be very valuable

to have results from a Navier-Stokes model for the latter case. McMullen, Jameson
and Alonso [38] have also done calculations for this set of experimental data using
the harmonic balance method and obtained similar results. They have done a careful
grid convergence study as well.
Finally the valuable study of Krieiselmaieer and Laschka [39] is noted. In this
work they develop a time linearized Euler model and compare the results obtained
to those from a fully dynamically nonlinear Euler model. The cases considered are
a NACA 0012 airfoil in subsonic ﬂow, the NACA 64A010 in transonic ﬂow and a
3% parabolic arc airfoil in supersonic ﬂow, as well as the three-dimensional ﬂow
about the LANN wing. Their principal conclusions are that the computational cost
of the time linearized code is about an order of magnitude less than that of the fully
nonlinear code (consistent with the ﬁndings of other investigators) and that the results
from the two theoretical models are in good agreement for the cases and parameter
ranges investigated. As already noted previously, a time linearized ﬂow model is
sufﬁcient to predict the ﬂutter boundary per se, but of course cannot predict LCO
amplitudes.
A recent NATO report by a Research and Technology Organization Working
Group Ruiz-Calavera [40] provides a comprehensive experimental data base drawn
from many sources in the literature for the veriﬁcation and validation of computa-
tional unsteady aerodynamic computational codes. Comparisons of the experimental
data with selected aerodynamic computer models and codes are also provided. Addi-
tional such theoretical/experimental correlations may be expected using this unique
collection of data. See especially the paper 8C by Schuster and Bartels in [40].

Flutter Boundaries in Transonic Flow
7.1
AGARD 445.6 Wing
Bennett and Edwards [20] have discussed the state of the art of Computational Aeroe-
lasticity (CAE) in a relatively recent paper and made several insightful comments
about various correlation studies. The NASA Langley team pioneered in providing
correlations for the AGARD 445.6 wing in the transonic ﬂow region. In Fig.6 a
comparison of ﬂutter speed index (FSI) and ﬂutter frequency is shown as a function
of Mach number between the results from experiment and theory. The theoretical
results are for transonic nonlinear potential ﬂow theory without (CAP-TSD) and
with (CAP-TSDV) a boundary layer model to account for viscous ﬂow effects; and
also for an Euler (CFL3D-Euler) and Navier-Stokes (CFL3D-NS) ﬂow model. For
this thin wing, there are no signiﬁcant transonic effects in the steady ﬂow over the
wing surface at the Mach numbers with experimental results except for M = 0.96
where there is a very weak shock on the surface. For the subsonic conditions, all
computational results are in very good agreement with experiment. The two low
supersonic test conditions have been problematic for CAE. Inviscid computations
have produced high ﬂutter speed index values relative to the experimental FSI and
viscous computations have accounted for about one half the difference between the-
ory and experiment. Several investigators have now done similar Euler calculations
and obtained similar results Farhat and Lesoinne [41–43]; Ravfeh, Levy and Karpel
[44]; Thomas, Dowell and Hall [45, 46]. The excellent agreement of the wholly lin-
ear theory results with experiment should probably be regarded as fortuitous. Also

and interestingly, Gupta [47], who also used an Euler based CFD model, obtains
results in better agreement with experiment at the low supersonic conditions, though
in less good agreement with experiment than the other Euler based results at subsonic
conditions. Thus, CAE computations for this low supersonic region have unresolved
issues which probably involve details such as wind tunnel wall interference effects
and ﬂutter test procedures, as well as CAE modeling issues.
7.2
HSCT Rigid and Flexible Semispan Models
Two semispan models representative of High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) con-
ﬁgurations were tested in the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics
Tunnel (TDT) in heavy gas. A Rigid Semispan Model (RSM) was tested mounted on
an Oscillating Turn Table (OTT) and on a Pitch And Plunge Apparatus (PAPA). The
RSM/OTT test Scott et al. [48] acquired unsteady pressure data due to pitching oscil-
lations and the RSM/PAPA test acquired ﬂutter boundary data for simple pitching and
plunging motions. The FSM test Silva et al. [49] involved an aeroelastically-scaled
model and was mounted to the TDT sidewall. The test acquired unsteady pressure
data and ﬂutter boundary data. Figure7 Scott et al. [48] shows the unexpectedly large
effect of mean angle of attack upon the ﬂutter boundaries for the RSM/PAPA model.
Flutter of thin wings at subsonic conditions is typically independent of angle-of-
attack within the linear ﬂow region. Figure8 Silva et al. [49] shows a summary of the
ﬂutter and high dynamic response regions for the RSM. Squares indicate conditions
where forced response measurements due to trailing edge control surface oscillations
were made. The ‘analysis’ ﬂutter boundary is from an early ﬁnite element model.

Updated modeling places the (linear) ﬂutter boundary slightly above the indicated
‘hard ﬂutter’ point. A region of increased response in ﬁrst wing bending (8.5Hz.)
was encountered in the Mach number range of 0.90–0.98. Finally, an narrow region
of LCO behavior, labelled ’chimney’, was encountered for M = 0.98–1.00 and over a
wide range of dynamic pressures. Response frequency ranged from 11.9 to 14.0Hz.
And the region was traversed a number of times prior to encountering the hard ﬂutter
point at M = 0.979 and q = 246 pounds per square foot where the model was lost.
7.3
Benchmark Active Control Technology (BACT) Model
This rectangular wing model had a panel aspect ratio of two and a NACA 0012 airfoil
section. See Bennett et al. [50, 51] and Ruiz-Calavera [40, 52]. It was mounted on
a pitching and plunging apparatus which allowed ﬂutter testing with two simple
degrees of freedom. It was extensively instrumented with unsteady pressure sensors
and accelerometers and it could be held ﬁxed (static) for forced oscillation testing or
free for dynamic response measurements. Data sets for trailing-edge control surface
oscillations and upper-surface spoiler oscillations for a range of Mach numbers, angle
of attack, and static control deﬂections are available. The model exhibited three types
of ﬂutter instability illustrated in Fig.9.
A classical ﬂutter boundary is shown, for α = 2 deg as a conventional boundary
versus Mach number with a minimum, the transonic ‘dip’, near M = 0.77 and a
subsequent rise. Stall ﬂutter was found, for α > 4 deg near the minimum of the
ﬂutter boundary (and at most tunnel conditions where high angles of attack could
be attained). Finally, a narrow region of instability occurs near M = 0.92 consisting
of plunging motion at the plunge mode wind-off frequency. This type of transonic

506

instability has sometimes been termed single-degree-of-freedom ﬂutter. It is caused
by the fore and aft motion of symmetric shocks on the upper and lower surfaces
for this wing. It was very sensitive to any biases and does not occur with nonzero
control surface bias or nonzero alpha. Such a stability boundary feature is often
termed a ‘chimney’ since the oscillations are typically slowly diverging or constant
amplitude (LCO) and it is found, sometimes, that safe conditions can be attained
with small further increases in Mach number. Note that the Mach number for the
plunge instability decreases slightly with increasing pressure.
7.4
Isogai Case a Model
Another benchmark case often used for theoretical/theoretical comparisons is the
famous Isogai Case A, again for a NACA 64A010 airfoil with certain structural
parameters that lead to a complex transonic ﬂutter boundary for a plunging and
pitching airfoil. A recent study is that by Hall, Thomas and Dowell [53, 54] that
includes comparisons with the earlier results of Isogai [55], Ehlers and Weatherill
[56] and Edwards et al. [57]. The latter results were all obtained using nonlinear
potentialﬂowmodels(insomecasestheyweretimelinearized,whichshouldmakeno
difference for determining the ﬂutter boundary per se), while the results of Hall et al.
were obtained using a time linearized Euler model. There is encouraging agreement
among all models for this complex transonic ﬂutter boundary as seen in Fig.10. Note

therapidchangeinﬂutterspeedindexastheMachnumberisvaried.Thisisassociated
with a change in the critical ﬂutter mode (eigenvector). Two additional studies by
Prananta et al. [58] and Bohbot and Darracq [59] have included turbulence modeling
for this case. Their results show that viscosity reduces the extent of the transonic dip
in the ﬂutter boundary signiﬁcantly and eliminates the double valued FSI that are
seen over a portion of the Mach number range in the inviscid calculations. Bohbot
and Darracq also show a signiﬁcant decrease in LCO amplitude due to viscosity at
M = 0.9025.
Bendiksen[60–62] has made two important observations about transonic ﬂutter
boundaries. One is with respect to an experimental study done some years ago at
NASA Langley to consider the effects of airfoil thickness ratio Dogget, Rainey and
Morgan [63] for the same airfoil proﬁle. Bendiksen notes that the family of results
for the variation of ﬂutter speed index with Mach number for the several thickness
ratios can be reduced to a single curve when the data are replotted using (nonlinear
potential ﬂow) transonic steady ﬂow similarity variables. These similarity parameters
rescale the aerodynamic pressure using non-dimensional parameters that combine
the Mach number and thickness ratio. Essentially this rescaling shows an equivalence
between changes in Mach number and thickness ratio in the transonic range. As the
rescaling is based upon steady ﬂow similarity variables, it presumably works best
when the reduced frequency is small as might be the case for bending/torsion ﬂutter,
but perhaps not for single degree of freedom ﬂutter due to negative damping. See, for
example, Dowell et al. [64] for a discussion of various types of ﬂutter that may occur.
Implicitly the success of this rescaling also supports the more general observation
that for transonic ﬂow it is important to model accurately the position and strength of

508
E. H. Dowell
the shock wave for steady ﬂow conditions before attempting unsteady aerodynamic
or aeroelastic calculations.
The other important point made by Bendiksen is that in the transonic range the
ﬂutter speed index may vary rapidly, not only because of a change in ﬂutter type or
mode (as has been noted by several investigators), but also because of the substantial
changes in mass ratio that may occur in wind tunnel test trajectories. This may explain
in part the so called “chimneys” in ﬂutter boundaries that have been observed in
transonic ﬂutter wind tunnel test data.
In this regard it is interesting to note that Denegri [3] presents ﬂight test data
showing LCO at nearly constant Mach number over large variations of altitude.
Many “typical LCO” encounters result in termination of testing due to increasing
response levels with each increase in Mach number because of concern for aircraft
safety. Some “non-typical LCO” encounters are reminiscent of the “chimney” feature
in that response levels increased to a maximum and then decreased with increasing
Mach number.

Limit Cycle Oscillations
8.1
Airfoils with Stiffness Nonlinearities
Many investigators have considered such a conﬁguration with a variety of nonlinear
stiffness modes. For a description of the work on freeplay nonlinearities including a
discussion of the literature, see the article by Dowell and Tang [65] which focuses on
correlations between theory and experiment. In general good quantitative correlation
is found for simple wind tunnel models and the basic physical mechanism that leads
to LCO appears well understood. Among the important insights developed include
the demonstration that the LCO amplitude and the effect of mean angle of attack on
LCO amplitude both simply scale in proportion to the range of freeplay present in
the aeroelastic system.
Here we consider in more depth the valuable and recent work of the Texas A&M
team [66–71]. They have conducted experiments with their Nonlinear Aeroelastic
Test Apparatus (NATA) in a low speed wind tunnel, and these investigations of
typical section models provided validation of their theoretical models. See Fig.11.
The NATA testbed has been used to investigate both linear and nonlinear responses
of wing sections as well as the development of active control methods. Three wing
sections have been used in their research: a NACA 0015 wing section without a
control surface; a NACA 0015 wing section with a 20% chord full span trailing
edge control surface; and, a NACA 0012 wing section with a 15% chord, full span
leading edge and a 20% chord, full span trailing edge control surfaces. The pitch
and plunge stiffness of the NATA is provided by springs attached to cams with
shapes prescribed to impart speciﬁc response. For example, a parabolic pitch cam
yields a spring hardening response tailored to mimic the response of interest. With

such a nonlinear pitch cam in place, the system will experience LCO response. It is
noteworthy that similar nonlinear spring hardening behavior has been observed in
static measurements of the F/A-18 wing Thompson and Strganac [71]. A polynomial
representation of the spring hardening behavior provides a quite effective model of
the response. Encoders are use to measure all motions.
The experimental and analytical efforts of O’Neil, et al. used a model with a non-
linear structural stiffness. In these studies, the stiffness grew (i.e., spring-hardened)
in a smooth, continuous manner with amplitude of motion. The effect on ﬂutter of a
structure with stiffness that grew in a cubic manner was investigated, and the results
showed that LCOs occurred and the stability boundary was insensitive to initial con-
ditions. As the freestream velocity was increased, the amplitude of the LCO increased
and less time was required to reach the LCO. A representative result for LCO shown
as phase plane diagrams is presented in Fig.12.
8.2
Nonlinear Internal Resonance Behavior
Unusual ﬁndings from a wind tunnel experiment have been a motivation for stud-
ies of the possible presence of internal resonance’s in aeroelastic systems. Internal
resonance (IR) occurs as a result of nonlinearities present in the system, and leads
to an exchange of energy between the system modes. The amount of energy that
is exchanged depends on the type of nonlinearity and the relationship of the linear
natural frequencies. IR exists when the linear natural frequencies of a system are
commensurable, or nearly so, and the nonlinearities of the system provide a source

510
E. H. Dowell
Fig. 12 Large amplitude LCO’s, induced by a hardening in structural stiffness, as measured with
the NATA
of coupling. Commensurability is deﬁned as
m1ω1 + m2ω2 + . . . + mnωn ≈0
where mn are positive or negative integers, and ωn are the natural frequencies of the
system. Although an integer natural frequency ratio does not guarantee IR, it does
form a necessary condition for IR. IR has been shown to exist in many systems, and
its presence depends on the geometry, composition of nonlinearities and boundary
conditions.
During wind tunnel tests by Cole [72] intended to verify the aeroelastic stability of
anewwingdesign,anunexpectedﬂutter-typeresponseoccurredatdynamicpressures
much lower than analysis had predicted. It is important to note that predictive tools
based upon linear theory were used. For the physical structure, the natural frequency
of the second bending mode of the wind tunnel model was slightly more than twice
the natural frequency of the ﬁrst torsional mode. However, since frequencies in an
aeroelastic system depend on the aerodynamic loads, a system’s frequencies may be
tuned as the velocity changes. In Cole’s experiments, a resonance-type condition may
have been reached before linear ﬂutter conditions. Consequently, it was considered
that the inaccurate predictions were due to the limitations presented by the use of
linear theory.
In an attempt to explain the unexpected experimental results, Oh, Nayfeh and
Mook [73] developed an experiment to examine the structural dynamic behavior
of Cole’s experiments. These experiments were conducted in the absence of any
aerodynamic loads. They determined, theoretically and experimentally, the linear
natural frequencies and the mode shapes, and also experimentally showed that an
antisymmetric vibration mode of a cantilever metallic plate was indirectly excited by
a2:1internalresonancemechanism.Toexplaintheexperimentalresults,theyreferred

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
511
to the study of Pai and Nayfeh [74] in which they considered nonlinear beam theory.
The two-to-one IR was present since the natural frequency of the second bending
mode being nearly twice the natural frequency of the ﬁrst torsional mode. Their
experiment consisted of a base excitation being applied to a cantilevered plate with
the same aspect ratio as Cole’s wing. However, in this study the second bending
mode was excited by a shaker rather than by aerodynamic forces.
Internal resonance has been used to suppress the vibrations of ﬂexible structures.
Studies show that during the resonance, the nonlinear modal amplitudes exchanged
energy back and forth over time, even in the presence of damping. It was also shown
that in the presence of an external excitation, the internal resonances give rise to
coupling between the modes, leading to several motions including nonlinear periodic,
almost periodic, and chaos.
Although many researchers have investigated IR in various types of mechanical
systems, relatively little attention has been given to the study of IR in aeroelastic
systems. Stearman, et al. [75] studied resonances in aeroelastic systems, and showed
that both combination-type and parametric resonances can occur. These resonances
occurred if
 f ≈2ωn/k
and
 f ≈|ωi ± ω j|/k
where k is an integer,  f is the frequency of the external forcing function, ωi, ω j
and ωn are normal mode frequencies. Their study explored the use of statistical
techniques to analyze ﬂight test data.
Gilliatt et al. [76] and Chang et al. [77] both studied the possible presence and
effects of internal resonances in aeroelastic systems. Gilliatt, in particular, was moti-
vated by the experimental ﬁndings of Cole. The two degree-of-freedom model of
O’Neil’s research was a basis for the study, and a quasi-steady aerodynamic model
was extended to include stall effects which introduced strong cubic nonlinearities
into the equations of motion. The system parameters were selected to permit the
aeroelastic frequencies to pass through a 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 ratio as the ﬂowﬁeld
velocity was increased. Gilliatt found that the presence of cubic nonlinearities in the
aeroelastic system led to a 3:1 internal resonance.

Delta Wings with Geometrical Plate Nonlinearities
At low Mach numbers, see for example Tang and Dowell [78], good correlation has
been demonstrated between theory and experiment for LCO amplitudes and frequen-
cies. Since these results are well documented elsewhere, see also Dowell and Tang
[65], here the recent work of Gordnier et al. [79, 80] that has extended these correla-
tions into the transonic range is emphasized. In Fig.13 a cropped delta wing planform
is shown. This conﬁguration had been investigated experimentally by Schairer and
Hand [81] and the theoretical calculations were done by Gordnier et al. using both
Euler and Navier-Stokes ﬂow models. Initially the theoretical calculations were done
using a linear structural model, which gave predicted LCO amplitudes much greater

than those observed experimentally. This led Gordnier to include nonlinearities in
the structural model (tension induced by bending) via Von Karman’s nonlinear plate
theory that provided much improved correlation between theory and experiment.
See Fig.14 which shows a plot of LCO amplitude versus ﬂow dynamic pressure at
a ﬁxed transonic Mach number. Note that the effects of viscosity are modest based
upon the comparisons of results using the Euler verses Navier-Stokes models. Also
the much improved agreement obtained with the nonlinear structural model suggests
that aerodynamic nonlinearities per se are not as signiﬁcant for this conﬁguration
as are the structural nonlinearities as Gordnier notes in his conclusions. Perhaps the
most signiﬁcant impact of this example is to illustrate that even for a transonic ﬂow,
there are cases where structural nonlinearities may be dominant.

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
513
It is also interesting to note that for this example that the most signiﬁcant aero-
dynamic nonlinearity was associated with leading edge vortices rather than shock
motion. This nonlinear aerodynamic ﬂow mechanism has also been studied by Mook
and colleagues, e.g. Preidikman et al. [82] at low Mach numbers in a series of papers.
As Gordnier and Mook note nonlinear vortex ﬂow phenomena may be important
when structural nonlinearities are weaker and the corresponding structural motions
greater. Of course if the mean angle of attack is sufﬁciently large (say 10 degrees or
more) then vortex formation may be important for even smaller wing oscillations.
8.4
Very High Aspect Ratio Wings with Both Structural and
Aerodynamic Nonlinearities
Notable contributions have been made by Patil, Hodges and Cesnik [83, 84] and
Tang and Dowell [85]. This case has been discussed in some depth by Dowell and
Tang [65] and that discussion will not be repeated here. In summary, however, both
structural geometrical nonlinearities (associated with torsional motion and bending
both transverse and parallel to the beam /rod chord) and aerodynamic nonlinearities
(associated with ﬂow separation and wing stall ) have been shown to be important.
Also wing stall has been shown to lead to hysteretic LCO response with increases
and decreases in ﬂow velocity. The correlation of theory and experiment is good,
albeit the extant theory uses a semi-empirical model to account for wing stall. Again
it would be highly desirable to use a Navier-Stokes ﬂow model for correlation with
this experiment and indeed this case is a good benchmark for such ﬂow models.
Further recent work has been done by Kim and Strganac [86] who used the equa-
tions of Crespo da Silva [87] to examine store-induced LCOs for the cantilevered
wing-with-store conﬁguration. These equations contain structural coupling terms
and quadratic and cubic nonlinearities due to curvature and inertia. Several pos-
sible nonlinearities, including aerodynamic, structural, and store-induced sources,
were considered. Structural nonlinearities were derived from large deformations.
Aerodynamic nonlinearities were introduced through a stall model. Store-induced
nonlinearities were introduced by kinematics of a suspended store. All of these non-
linearities retained cubic nonlinear terms. To examine systematically the response
characteristics, phase plane analysis was performed and the effect of each nonlin-
earity, as well as combinations of the nonlinearities were studied. Although various
forms of nonlinear responses were found, of interest was the ﬁnding of LCO response
at speeds below the ﬂutter velocity. Furthermore, an unstable boundary was found,
above which responses were attracted to the LCO and below which the responses
were attracted to the nominal static equilibria. Of special importance, such subcritical
response was found for only the case in which complete consideration of structural,
aerodynamic, and store-induced nonlinearities was given. This suggested that studies
of nonlinear aeroelasticity must sometimes consider a full aircraft conﬁguration. A
representative result is shown in Fig.15.

matic nonlinearities might be considered negligible in practice, they may introduce
atypical behavior that would not be predicted by linear system analysis.
8.5
Nonlinear Structural Damping
Even linear aeroelastic models often use empirical models of structural damping; thus
little is known fundamentally about how to model structural damping for LCO. How-
ever an interesting and insightful hypothesis has been offered by Chen, Saarhaddi
and Liu [88]. If one assumes that the structural damping increases with amplitude
of structural motion (there is some experimental evidence to suggest this may be
the case), and if the negative aerodynamic damping associated with ﬂutter remains
sufﬁciently small beyond the ﬂutter boundary, then the nonlinear increase in struc-
tural damping may offset the negative aerodynamic damping and this will lead to a
nonlinear, neutrally stable motion, i.e., LCO. Liu et al. have performed calculations
based upon this hypothesis that appear consistent with some of the LCO observed in
the F-16 aircraft.
8.6
Large Shock Motions and Flow Separation
These aerodynamic nonlinearities are both the most difﬁcult to model theoretically
and also to investigate experimentally. Hence it is perhaps not surprising that our
correlations between theory and experiment are not yet what we might like them to

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
515
be. As a corollary one might observe that it will in all likelihood be easier to design a
favorable nonlinear structural element to produce a benign LCO, than to assure that
ﬂow nonlinearities will always be beneﬁcial with respect to LCO.
8.6.1
NACA 64A010A Conventional Airfoil Models
In Fig.16 recent results are shown for the LCO of a NACA 64A010 airfoil in plunge
and pitch as predicted by an Euler ﬂow model Kholodar, Thomas, Dowell and Hall
[89]. Here the LCO amplitude is plotted versus the ﬂutter speed index (FSI) for a
range of Mach number. As can be seen the LCO is relatively weak (the curves of
the ﬁgure are nearly vertical) for most Mach numbers. And for those Mach numbers
where the LCO is relatively strong, it can be either benign (the curves bend to the
right) or detrimental (the curves bend to the left) leading to LCO below the ﬂutter
boundary. This example also points out the substantial amount of data needed to
assess LCO under these circumstances. A Navier-Stokes model has also been used
to assess LCO of this conﬁguration for a more limited range of parameters. The
results (not shown) indicate a modest effect of viscosity provided the mean angle of
attack is sufﬁciently small and no ﬂow separation occurs.
8.6.2
NLR 7301 Supercritical Airfoil Models
Another conﬁguration of interest is the supercritical airfoil, NLR 7301, which has
been studied experimentally by Schewe and his colleagues [90–93]. This has in turn

inspired several theoretical studies using either an Euler or Navier-Stokes ﬂow model.
A correlation among several theoretical models and the result of experiment is shown
in Fig.17. This ﬁgure is drawn from the paper by Thomas, Dowell and Hall [94] who
used a harmonic balance LCO solution method. Results are also shown from Weber et
al. [95] and Tang et al. [96] both of whom used the more computationally demanding
time marching technique. Note that there is only a single data point from the latter as
is the case from the experiment. However it is clear that to have a more meaningful
correlation it is highly desirable to provide results for LCO amplitude over a range
of FSI and Mach number. Hence it is not yet clear what the conclusion should be
with respect to correlation between theory and experiment. It does appear that the
several theoretical results are in reasonable agreement. More correlations with the
experimental data are needed.
Computational conditions are sensitive and care must be taken to achieve rea-
sonable steady initial pressure distributions for this conﬁguration. Also, the LCO
conditions appear to be very sensitive to details of the computations. Tang et al. give
results from the CFL3D-NS code illustrating effects of turbulence models, single-
block and multi-block (parallel), multigrid subiterations, and time step. Agreement
for the LCO motion amplitudes has been difﬁcult to achieve for this case even includ-
ing the effects of wind tunnel wall interference. Castro et al. [97].
8.6.3
AGARD 445.6 Wing Models
The AGARD 445.6 wing has been discussed earlier in terms of its ﬂutter boundary;
now we turn to very recent results from Thomas, Dowell and Hall [9i8] for LCO. The
correlation between theory and experiment for the ﬂutter boundary is again shown
in Fig.18 where the Euler ﬂow model is that of Thomas et al. The ﬂutter boundary
correlation is consistent with that discussed earlier relative to Fig.6. But now we
have in additional results for LCO amplitude versus FSI for various Mach number.

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
517
Fig. 18 Flutter speed index verses mach number for AGARD wing 445.6: comparison of theory
and experiment
See Fig.19. Note that a value of ﬁrst mode non-dimensional modal amplitude of
ξ = .012 as shown in this ﬁgure corresponds to a wing tip deﬂection equal to one
fourth of the wing half-span. Note also that in general the LCO is predicted to be
weak and there is no Mach number for which a benign LCO is predicted. Indeed the
strongest LCO is detrimental and occurs at the low supersonic Mach numbers, i.e.
M = 1.141 and 1.072. This means that LCO may occur below the ﬂutter boundary
at these two Mach numbers and perhaps this explains at least in part why ﬂutter (or
LCO) in the experiment occurs below the predicted ﬂutter boundary.
Small amplitude LCO behavior for the AGARD 445.6 wing has also been calcu-
lated by Edwards [99]. The majority of published calculations for this wing model
(actually a series of models with similar planforms) are for the “weakened model
♯3” tested in air, since this test covered the largest transonic Mach number range and
showed a signiﬁcant transonic dip in the ﬂutter boundary. The focus on this partic-
ular conﬁguration may be in some ways unfortunate, in that the model tested in air
resulted in unrealistically large mass ratios and small reduced frequencies. Weakened
models ♯5 and ♯6 were tested in heavy gas and had smaller mass ratios and higher
reduced frequencies. Very good agreement was obtained with experiment for ﬂutter
speed index using the CAP-TSDV code over the Mach number range tested. For the
highest Mach number tested, M = 0.96, it was noted that damping levels extracted
from the computed transients were amplitude dependent, an indicator of nonlinear
behavior. It was also found that small amplitude divergent (in time) responses used

to infer the ﬂutter boundary would transition to LCO when the calculation was con-
tinued further in time. The wing tip amplitude of the LCO was approximately 0.12
inches peak-to-peak, a level that is unlikely to be detected in wind tunnel tests given
the levels of model response to normal wind tunnel turbulence.
8.6.4
MAVRIC Wing Flutter Model
This business jet wing-fuselage model Edwards [99, 100] was chosen by NASA Lan-
gley Research Center’s Models For Aeroelastic Validation Involving Computation
(MAVRIC) project with the goal of obtaining experimental wind-tunnel data suitable
for Computational Aeroelasticity (CAE) code validation at transonic separationonset
conditions. LCO behavior was a primary target. An inexpensive construction method
of stepped-thickness aluminum plate covered with end-grain balsa wood and con-
toured to the desired wing proﬁle was used. A signiﬁcant beneﬁt of this method
was the additional strength of the plate that enabled the model to withstand large
amplitude LCO motions without damage.
The model was instrumented with three chords of unsteady pressure transduc-
ers and eight accelerometers. It was tested in air and in heavy gas and with three
wingtip conﬁgurations: clean, winglet, and pencil tipstore. Figure20 shows the Flut-
ter Speed Index (FSI) boundary versus Mach number from an earlier test of this model
Edwards [101], including computed CAE code comparisons. The experimental ﬂut-
ter boundary shows a gradual decrease in dynamic pressure, reaching a minimum

519

verses mach number for

at M = 0.89. The structural modiﬁcations and added instrumentation resulting in
the MAVRIC model had very little effect upon the ﬂutter boundary. Both the Tran-
sonic Small Disturbance CAP-TSDV and the higher level CFL3D codes are in good
agreement with experiment at the lower Mach numbers. Both inviscid codes, CAP-
TSD and CFL3D-Euler, increasingly depart from experimental values approaching
the minimum FSI value. This emphasizes the necessity of the inclusion of viscous
shock-boundary layer interaction effects for LCO-like motions. Both viscous codes,
CAP-TSDV and CFL3D-NS, are in good agreement with experiment at M = 0.89
where small amplitude, time-marching responses were used to identify the ﬂutter
boundary.
The behavior of the MAVRIC model as ﬂutter was approached during the wind
tunnel test indicated that wing motions tended to settle to a large amplitude LCO
condition, especially in the Mach number range near the minimum FSI conditions.
Figure21 [Edwards [102]] indicates the ability of the CAP-TSDV code to simulate
these large amplitude LCO motions. Large and small initial condition disturbance
transient responses clearly show the six inch peak-to-peak wingtip motions observed
in the tests. Such large amplitude aeroelastic motions have not been demonstrated
by RANS codes which have difﬁculty maintaining grid cell structure for signiﬁcant
grid deformations. Figure22 Edwards et al. [100] shows the map of the regions of
LCO found in the MAVRIC test in the vicinity of the minimum FSI (clean wingtip,
deg.). Numbers for the several contours in the ﬁgure give the half-amplitude of
wingtip LCO motions, in g’s, in the indicated regions. Two regions, signiﬁed by ‘B’,
are regions where ‘beating’ vibrations were observed. For this test condition, wing

motions are predominantly of the wing ﬁrst bending mode at a frequency of 7–8Hz.
(wind-off modal frequency is 4.07Hz.). Two chimney features are seen, at M = 0.91
and at M = 0.94. Edwards discusses ﬂutter model responses which are indicative
of more complex nonlinear behaviors than are commonly attributed to LCO. Thus,
ﬂutter test engineers are familiar with responses such as ‘bursting’ and ‘beating,’
commonly used as indicators of the approach to ﬂutter (and LCO).
8.6.5
Clipped-Tip Delta Wing Control Surface Buzz Model
Parker et al. [103] describe a test of a clipped-tip delta wing model with a full span
control surface. The leading-edge sweep was 60◦, the biconvex wing proﬁle had
thickness of 3% of local chord, and the constant chord control surface length was
approximately 13% of the root chord. The control surface was mounted on two
ﬂexure springs. The tests were conducted in air which is of concern since there
are known to be severe Reynolds number and/or transition effects for this tunnel at
dynamic pressures below 50–75 pounds per square foot Edwards et al. [100]. Pak and
Baker [104] have performed computational studies of this case. They compare the
experimental buzz boundary with time-marching transient responses calculated with
the CFL3D-NS code and the CAP-TSDV code, respectively. Both codes capture
LCO behavior near the experimental buzz conditions with the higher level code
appearing to have better agreement for the experimental trend versus Mach number.
The responses offer excellent insight into issues and problems of the use of CAE
time-marching codes for LCO-like studies. The record lengths of a number of the
responses, which are extremely expensive to compute, are not sufﬁcient for clear
determination of the response ﬁnal status. Also, LCO behaviors can result from very
delicate force balances and settling times to ﬁnal LCO states can require many cycles
of oscillation.
8.6.6
Residual Pitch Oscillations on the B-2
The B-2 bomber encountered a nonlinear aeroelastic Residual Pitch Oscillation
(RPO) during low altitude high speed ﬂight. See Dreim et al. [14]. Neither the RPO
or any tendency of lightly damped response had been predicted by wholly linear
aeroelastic design methods. The RPO involved symmetric wing bending modes and
rigid body degrees of freedom. It was possible to augment the CAP-TSDV aeroelastic
analysis code with capability for the longitudinal short-period rigid body motions,
vehicle trim, and the full-time active ﬂight control system including actuator dynam-
ics. This computational capability enabled the analysis of the heavyweight, forward
center of gravity ﬂight condition. The simulation predicts open loop instability at M
= 0.775 and closed loop instability at M = 0.81 in agreement with ﬂight test. In order
to capture the limit cycle behavior of the RPO it was necessary to include modeling
of the nonlinear hysteretic response characteristic of the B-2 control surfaces for
small amplitude motions. This is caused by the small overlap of the servohydraulic

522
E. H. Dowell
control valve spool ﬂanges with their mating hydraulic ﬂuid oriﬁces. With this realis-
tic actuator modeling also included, limited amplitude RPO motions similar to those
measured in ﬂight were simulated as shown. A lighter weight ﬂight test conﬁgura-
tion exhibited very light damping near M = 0.82 but did not exhibit fully developed
RPO. Instead damping increased with slight further increase in speed, typical of
hump mode behavior. The CAP-TSDV simulations did not capture this hump mode
behavior.
8.6.7
Rectangular Goland Wing Model with Tip Store
We conclude this section with a discussion of the recent and valuable papers by
Beran et al. [105] and Huttsell et al. [106]. In the paper by Beran et al. comparisons
were made between the predictions of a fully nonlinear potential ﬂow plus boundary
layer model (CAP-TSDV) and the results from classical fully linear theory (doublet
lattice). The Goland wing was used for this study which is a rectangular planform
with a 4% parabolic arc airfoil. In Fig.23 ﬂutter boundaries and what is termed a LCO
boundary are shown for the two theoretical methods. Results for the wing alone and
for a wing with a tip store are given. Beran et al. note that for this conﬁguration the

Fig. 24 LCO response verses ﬂow velocity. An example of hysteresis for goland wing
is important as seen in the ﬁgure. Note also that the two ﬂow models give results in
good agreement for the subsonic Mach number range, but differ substantially in the
transonic range. Beran et al. distinguish between the ﬂutter boundary (for the wing
plus tip store) and the LCO boundary. However based upon the work of others that
show that rapid changes in ﬂutter (and LCO) modes may occur, it seems likely that
these are both ﬂutter boundaries per se. At the subsonic Mach number it is likely
that no LCO was observed in these time simulations because the LCO is very weak.
That is at subsonic Mach numbers the time simulation shows a rapidly exponentially
diverging oscillation typical of a linear dynamical system. LCO was observed over a
narrow range of transonic Mach number (again consistent with the ﬁndings of other
investigators for other conﬁgurations) where the aerodynamic nonlinearity is strong
enough that a time simulation will reach a ﬁnite steady state LCO amplitude in a
reasonable amount of computational time. However if the initial disturbance to the
system is small enough or there is little hysteresis in the dependence of LCO steady
state amplitude on speed index, then the boundary for the onset of LCO should be
essentially the same as the ﬂutter boundary. There is some mild hysteretic LCO
behavior for this conﬁguration as is discussed further in the paragraph after next.
In Fig.24a the LCO amplitude is shown as a function of ﬂow velocity for various
theoretical models. Results are shown with and without store aerodynamics (again
the differences are small) and with and without the effects of viscosity. As can be
seen there is little effect of viscosity on the ﬂow velocity at the onset of ﬂutter and
LCO, but the effect on LCO amplitude per se is substantial. (The abrupt increase in
LCO response for the inviscid model may be indicative of unrealistic shock motions.)
Recall the results of Thomas, Dowell and Hall [94] for the NLR 7301 airfoil which
showed similar behavior when comparing LCO response from inviscid and viscous
ﬂow models. And also recall the results of Bohbot and Darracq [59] for the Isogai
Case A.

524
E. H. Dowell
Fig. 25 LCO response verses ﬂow velocity for goland wing
In Fig.24b inviscid ﬂow results are shown for various mean angles of attack.
The results are qualitatively similar, but the effect of increased angle of attack is to
increase the ﬂow velocity at which ﬂutter and LCO occur.
In Fig.25, the results of Fig.24 are shown again for increasing ﬂow velocity
(Perturbed Rigid IC) and decreasing ﬂow velocity (Path Following IC). The results
display hysteresis with the LCO amplitude observed being path dependent. As the
ﬂow velocity is increased and given a sufﬁciently small initial condition (IC) distur-
bance, no ﬂutter or LCO is seen until a velocity of about 390ft/s; but when the airfoil
is then allowed to oscillate in the LCO and the ﬂow velocity is now decreased, LCO
continues until a lower velocity is reached of about 385ft/s. Although the range of
ﬂow velocity over which hysteresis is observed is relatively small in this example,
there is every reason to expect that for other parameter choices the range of hysteresis
can be greater.

Time Marching Codes Compared to Various Experimental
Results
In the paper by Huttsell et al. [106] several state of the art time marching CFD
codes are used to investigate ﬂutter and LCO for challenging cases drawn from ﬂight

or wind tunnel tests. The CAP-TSD, CAP-TSDV, CFL3D and ENS3DAE codes
are all used. The results are extremely helpful in providing a realistic assessment
of the state of the art of these codes and they are also indicative of future needs
for improvements. For the F-15 example, difﬁculty was encountered in producing
a computational grid with negative ﬂuid volumes being encountered. For the AV8-
B a steady state ﬂow ﬁeld could not be found due to oscillations in the numerical
solver from one iteration to the next. These difﬁculties are not unusual for CFD
codes in the present authors’ experience. Sometimes the difﬁculty in achieving a
steady ﬂow solution is attributed to shedding in the ﬂow ﬁeld, but in the absence of
a full nonlinear dynamic CFD calculation, that must remain a speculation. For the
B-2 example encouraging agreement was obtained for the frequency and damping
variation of the critical ﬂutter (and LCO) mode as a function of ﬂight speed using
the CAP-TSDV code. For the B-1 estimates of the damping associated with LCO
were favorably compared to those found in wing tunnel tests using the CFL3DAE
code. It is not entirely clear what the “damping” of an LCO means, however, since by
deﬁnition LCO is a neutrally stable motion. Two control surface “buzz” cases were
considered and CFL3DAE had some success in predicting the behavior observed in
the wind tunnel for a NASP like conﬁguration.
As Huttsell et al. note, additional work is needed to improve CFD model robust-
ness, computational efﬁciency and grid generation deformation strategies.
8.7
Abrupt Wing Stall
Although not usually classiﬁed as a nonlinear aeroelastic response or LCO, abrupt
wing stall (AWS) appears to share some of the same basic characteristics. A joint
Navy/NASA/ Air Force program over the last several years has addressed this class
of phenomena Woodson [107]. Chambers [108] has presented a valuable historical
account of AWS and drawn lessons learned from a number of aircraft programs.
Much of the recent work on AWS has been motivated by experiences with the F-18.
Brieﬂy AWS is encountered when the aircraft is at a sufﬁciently high angle of
attack for ﬂow separation to occur and the ﬂow then begins to oscillate including
shock oscillations if the local Mach number is large enough. For large angles of
attack sonic conditions may be reached locally even for relatively low free stream
Mach numbers. This oscillating ﬂow may be asymmetric from one wing to the other
and therefore the aircraft will roll. If this rolling motion is a transient the motion
is usually called “wing drop” while if it is periodic in the roll angle it is called
“wing rock”. Wing rock has been modeled Nayfeh, Elzebda, Mook [109], Ericcson
[110] as a limit cycle oscillation due to nonlinear self-excited coupling between
the aerodynamic ﬂow and the rolling motion of the aircraft. Wing drop has been
modeled by including this effect Kokolios and Cook [111] and also the oscillating
aerodynamic rolling moment that may occur even in the absence of aircraft motion.
This oscillating aerodynamic moment is due to a nonlinear self-excitation of the ﬂow

526
E. H. Dowell
in the absence of aircraft motion and thus this moment is an “external” excitation as
far as the vehicle motion is concerned.
Since the dominant aircraft motion is rigid body roll rather than the an elastic
structural mode of the wing, for example, abrupt wing stall is not usually thought
of as being an aeroelastic issue per se. Yet from a dynamics perspective many of
the issues with respect to aerodynamic modeling and aircraft motion are similar to
those nonlinear phenomena discussed previously in this paper. Valuable free-to-roll
wind tunnel model studies have been performed at NASA Langley Research Center
by Lamar et al. [112] as have some CFD simulations of AWS. Several sessions and
papers devoted to this topic have been presented at the recent 2003 AIAA Aerospace
Sciences Meeting.
8.8
Uncertainty Due to Nonlinearity
Therehasbeenrecentandrenewedinterestintheimpactofuncertaintiesonaerospace
system response. Here two scenarios that have been reported by operators of current
aerospace systems are discussed and the relationship of uncertainty to nonlinearity
is noted.
8.8.1
Scenario I
One scenario that has been reported is the following. An aircraft in straight and level
ﬂight does not experience ﬂutter or LCO; however when the aircraft is maneuvered
LCO does occur and then when the aircraft is returned to straight and level ﬂight the
LCO persists. The question is, how has the maneuver generated LCO that persists in
straight and level ﬂight when LCO did not occur before the maneuver?
Withtheframeworkofalinearaeroelasticmodel,suchbehaviorisnotpossible,but
an explanation is possible for a nonlinear aeroelastic system as a result of hysteresis.
That is, if the disturbance to a nonlinear system is sufﬁciently small, LCO will
not occur, but if a sufﬁciently large disturbance is applied to the system, e.g., a
maneuver, then LCO may be induced. And once LCO exists, it may persist even if
one returns to the nominal original ﬂight condition. Such behavior has been observed
inbothmathematicalandexperimentalwindtunnelmodelswherethenonlineareffect
producing the LCO and hysteretic response is due to either structural freeplay or ﬂow
separation.
In this scenario the uncertainty is because two different nonlinear response states
are possible at the same parameter condition (ﬂight speed and altitude) and the prior
history of the system is critical in determining its response.

Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
527
8.8.2
Scenario II
In another scenario that has been observed, two distinct, but nominally identical
systems (aircraft) are ﬂown through the same trajectory and one encounters LCO
but the other does not. The question is, how is this possible? Again insights obtained
from nonlinear aeroelastic models may offer an explanation.
Consider an aircraft with freeplay as an example. Now it is very difﬁcult to main-
tain the same amount of freeplay in each and every aircraft. So what might happen
if two otherwise identical aircraft have different amounts of freeplay? For the air-
craft with the smaller freeplay, the LCO amplitude (which scales in proportion to the
magnitude of freeplay) might not be noticeable because it is too small. However for
the aircraft with the larger freeplay the LCO may be detectable. From recent theo-
retical and experimental studies of freeplay as discussed by Dowell and Tang [65],
not only is it known that LCO amplitudes increase in proportion to the magnitude of
the freeplay, but also that the magnitude of the angle of attack required to suppress
LCO due to freeplay scales in proportion to the magnitude of the freeplay. Thus the
aircraft with the larger freeplay will not only have a LCO of larger amplitude, but it
will also experience freeplay over a larger range of angle of attack, again making it
more likely that LCO will be observed.
These two scenarios and their possible explanation point up the importance of
developing a fundamental understanding of the underlying structural and ﬂuid non-
linearities that may occur in aeroelastic systems in dealing with the uncertainties and
apparent paradoxes that have been observed in practice.

Concluding Remarks
Substantial progress has been made in modeling and understanding nonlinear aeroe-
lastic phenomena. Experimental and theoretical investigations have shown good cor-
relation for a number of nonlinear physical mechanisms. As a broad generalization,
one may say that our understanding of and correlation among alternative theoretical
models and experiment is further advanced for nonlinear structural mechanisms such
as freeplay and large deﬂection geometric nonlinearities of beam s and plates, than it
is for nonlinear ﬂuid mechanisms such as large shock motions and separated ﬂows.
Nevertheless accurate and much more computationally efﬁcient theoretical models
are now becoming available for nonlinear aerodynamic ﬂows and there is cause for
optimism in addressing these issues going forward.
As has been emphasized throughout this chapter, a number of physical mecha-
nisms can lead to nonlinear aeroelastic response including the impact of steady ﬂow
ﬂuid or static structural nonlinearities in changing the ﬂutter boundary of an aeroelas-
tic system. Of course dynamic nonlinearities play a critical role in the development
of limit cycle oscillations, hysteresis in ﬂutter and LCO response, and the sensitivity
of both to initial and external disturbances.

The good news for the ﬂight vehicle designer is that because of nonlinear aeroelas-
tic effects, ﬁnite amplitude oscillations can in some cases replace what would other-
wise be the rapidly growing and destructive oscillations of classical ﬂutter behavior.
A careful consideration and design of favorable nonlinearities offers a new oppor-
tunity for improved performance and safety of valuable wind tunnel models, ﬂight
vehicles, their operators and passengers. And once nonlinear aeroelastic models have
reached a state of maturity sufﬁcient for their consideration in the design process,
then active and adaptive control can potentially provide for even greater ﬂight vehicle
performance. The discussion of active and adaptive control is beyond the scope of
this paper, but the reader may wish to consult the work of Heeg [113], Lazarus, et
al. [114, 115], Ko, et al. [68–70], Block and Strganac [67], Vipperman, et al. [116],

Aeroelastic Control
Robert Clark
Abstract Active control of aeroelastic systems is a subject of continuing interest
and this chapter provides an introduction to this fascinating topic.

Introduction
Aeroelastic phenomena, as described throughout this text, occur due to a feedback
effect between the unsteady aerodynamics and the structural dynamics of an airfoil or
vehicle. This two-way exchange of energy is what distinguishes aeroelastic phenom-
ena from driven vibration problems in structural dynamics. The presence of feedback
also provides much common ground between the disciplines of control theory and
aeroelasticity. In particular, the concept of stability is central to both ﬁelds, and the
accuracy of models are judged largely on the ability to predict the conditions under
which an instability will occur.
In control theory, linear time invariant (LTI) models form the basis for most types
of analysis and design. Models of this form, and extensions to linear parameter
varying systems, will be assumed for the methods discussed in this chapter. The
dynamics of lightly damped structures are well described by this type of model.
Using spatial expansions based on orthogonal functions [1], low order models can
be constructed that predict vibration accurately, particularly for small displacements.
Fluid dynamics, however, exhibit behavior on a wide range of scales and often are
sensitive to nonlinearities present in the physics. Nevertheless, as was discussed in
Chap. 9, many important cases of aeroelastic phenomena can be predicted with time-
linearized aerodynamic models. These models can account for effects such as shock,
separation and even turbulence in the steady solution, and the dynamic behavior is
treated as a linear perturbation about this solution. With this linear dynamic simpliﬁ-

cation, tools such as eigenvector analysis or singular value analysis become possible,
and aerodynamic models may be reduced in order similar to what is commonly done
with ﬁnite element structural models.

state-space modeling, balanced realization theory, and extensions to linear parameter
varying models. This is a relatively narrow presentation of control theory, and the
content is in no way meant to be comprehensive. Rather the intent is to introduce
the reader to possibilities with simple examples serving as vehicles for the concepts
presented. The broader area of controlling aeroelastic vehicles is described in the
work on aeroservoelasticity from Noll [2], the literature survey of Livne [3], and a
series of results from NASA sponsored research programs [4, 5].
Speciﬁcally, active ﬂutter suppression is developed for two example systems, a
typical section model andaﬂexibledeltawing. Experimental results arepresentedfor
both with feedback control based upon ﬁxed as well as gain-scheduled compensators.
A unifying theme to the presentation is the applicability of Hankel singular values
from the initial model reduction stage, aerodynamic, structural, or aeroelastic, to the
design of actuator and sensor systems for selectively targeting modes of the system.
Thus, we have chosen to provide an integrated design perspective for the presentation
of aeroelastic control.

Linear System Theory
The design of feedback control systems is dominated by the use of linear time invari-
ant (LTI) input/output models. The concepts described below are detailed in standard
linear systems texts including [6–9], and are provided here largely to introduce the
notation and terminology, which are also standard but may vary somewhat from
previous notation in this book.

where A ∈Rn×n, B ∈Rn×p, C ∈Rq×n, and D ∈Rq×p. This complete model is
often denoted by a single symbol, G, that can be either the transfer function matrix

State-space models can be developed at a subsystem level and combined by various
interconnections into full system models. Several important interconnections are
shown in the block diagrams of Fig. 1. Note that outputs appear on the left in these
block diagrams, consistent with the equations they represent. The series connection
of two systems G1 and G2, as shown in Fig. 1a, is

⎡
⎣

and the parallel connection, as shown in Fig. 1b, is

⎡
⎣

Finally the feedback connection of systems G1 and G2 as shown in Fig. 1c is,

where
Ru = (I −D2D1)−1,
Ry = (I −D1D2)−1
(7)
and simpliﬁes considerably if either system is strictly proper (i.e., D1 or D2 is zero).
The feedback connection is often deﬁned in terms of a linear fractional trans-
formation (LFT) on the systems involved. The LFT is a convenient formalism for
feedback effects and is commonly used in robust control design. It provides the abil-
ity to view uncertainty in a model as an unknown feedback effect and in so doing

z and w is given by the lower LFT,

w

Similarly, the upper LFT results if  relates w and z as shown in Fig. 2b, and this
is given by,
q =

M22 + M21(I −M11)−1M12
	
v
= Fu(M, )v
(10)
A useful property of the LFT is that algebraic combinations of LFTs which occur
due to parallel, series, or feedback connections preserve the LFT structure. There-
fore, systems with multiple LFTs can be represented by a single LFT of augmented
dimensions. The general linear robust control problem is represented by the block
diagram of Fig. 3, where  represents the effect of uncertainty on the system model,
and K represents a feedback control law. The closed-loop transfer function of interest
is
Tzw = Fl(Fu(T, ), K).
(11)
The linear optimal control problem involves ﬁnding K to minimize Tzw with  = 0,
while robust control seeks the same objective with only limited knowledge of the
uncertainty model .
In principle the uncertainty  can be made large enough to contain all the feed-
back effects of aerodynamics on a system. Then the aeroelastic control problem is
just regulation of the structural model while retaining stability in the presence of the
uncertainty. Such a design is a ﬁrst pass at including aerodynamics in a structural

Sect. 3.
2.2
Controllability and Observability
The LTI system of (1) is said to be controllable if for any initial condition, x(0), any
target state, x1, and any ﬁnal time, t f , there exists an input signal, u(t), deﬁned in
the interval t ∈[0, t f ] that will cause the system to satisfy x(t f ) = x1. In fact this
control signal can be explicitly calculated as,
u(τ) = −BT eAT (t f −τ)Wc(t f )−1(eAt f x(0) −x1);
(12)
where Wc, the controllability Gramian, is
Wc(t f ) =

 t f
o
eAτ BBT eAT τdτ.
(13)
The condition for existence of this signal is the invertibility of the matrix Wc(t f ) for
any ﬁnal time t f . For stable systems, only the inﬁnite time Gramian, Wc(∞) need be
calculated. The solution to (13) with inﬁnite ﬁnal time can be found from the positive
deﬁnite solution to the Lyapunov equation,
AWc + Wc AT + BBT = 0
(14)

540
R. Clark
If the matrix Wc is full rank, and therefore invertible, the system is said to be con-
trollable. Otherwise the system has at least some states which are not controllable
from the input.
A dual problem to that of system controllability is observability. A system is said
to be observable if for any time t f > 0, the initial state x(0) can be determined from
the output history y(t) over the interval t ∈[0, t f ]. The inﬁnite time observability
Gramian can be found as the solution to,
AT Wo + Wo A + CT C = 0.
(15)
and the system is observable if Wo is full rank.
Controllability and observability of a system is a standard assumption for many
problems involving the design of optimal control laws. In practice it is rare to
ﬁnd models built from physical principles that contain non-obvious unobservable
or uncontrollable subspaces. However these Gramians can provide more informa-
tion about a system than just a discrete test of controllability or observability. The
numerical conditioning of Wc (Wo) provides measure of the relative degree of con-
trollability (observability). For example if the singular values of Wc are spread over a
wide range, then the inverse will be ill-conditioned and from (12) one would expect
large control forces to reach a nominal x1, say on the unit ball, ∥x1∥= 1.
Clearly the conditioning of this matrix depends upon the units, and more generally
on the coordinates, of the internal state vector x. These coordinates are not unique
and an LTI system will have a family of equivalent models related by similarity
transformations. Transforming the state vector by any nonsingular matrix T as ˆx =
T x, yields equivalent realizations with the same input/output properties.
G(s) = C(sI −A)−1B + D :=
 T −1AT T −1B

D

.
(16)
A particularly useful coordinate system is called balanced coordinates, and is
deﬁnedas thecoordinatesysteminwhichtheobservabilityandcontrollabilityGrami-
ans are diagonal and equal, Wc = Wo. For a stable, observable and controllable sys-
tem such a realization always exists and is, by convention, ordered in such a way as
to relate the ﬁrst state of the model to the largest singular value of Wc, the second
state to the second largest singular value of Wc, and so forth. These singular values
are called the Hankel singular values (HSV) and they play an important role in model
reduction as well as system realization theory [11, 12]. The technique for calculating
transformations to balanced coordinates was ﬁrst introduced in [13] and is described
in detail in several textbooks, including [7, 9, 10].
It should also be noted that the absence of controllability and/or observability
isn’t always a negative thing. Control system design can be accomplished as long
as one can control or observe the modes of the system that are important for the
desired performance. As will be discussed later in Sect. 4, we can use the concept of
Hankelsingularvaluesinthecontextofcontrollabilityandobservabilitytoselectively

couple to some modes and intentionally minimize coupling to others. This leads to
the incorporation of control concepts in the physical design of a system.

Aeroelasticity: Aerodynamic Feedback
From spacecraft pointing to automotive ride quality many problems in structural
dynamics involve the response of a system to external disturbances. Aeroelastic
responses differ from these in that the source of the disturbance is strongly inﬂu-
enced by the structural response. This coupling is itself a feedback effect with the
aerodynamics providing a ﬂow-dependent feedback that can destabilize the system
either through divergence or ﬂutter. To study the aeroelastic problem as a feedback
interconnection it is convenient to develop approximate LTI models in state-space
form.
In this section state-space LTI models are constructed for two simple aeroelastic
systems. The ﬁrst is a typical section airfoil coupled with reduced order 2D potential
ﬂow. The combined system is shown to match standard results in the prediction of
ﬂutter, and also to match published results in the prediction of limit cycle oscillations.
The second system is a uniform delta wing coupled to a reduced-order 3D potential
ﬂow model. Both these models are sized with consideration to available experimental
hardware.

Development of a Typical Section Model

aeroelastic ﬂutter [14, 15] and was covered in some detail in Chap. 3 of this book. The

Aerodynamic Model, 2D
The structural model above must be coupled to an aerodynamic model to form the
complete system. Analytic aerodynamic models, such as those of Theodorsen [14],
have been used to study harmonic oscillations of the aeroelastic structure and used
to predict important features, such as the ﬂutter boundary. Approximations to these
solutions are possible, both in the frequency and time domain [16–18], and have been
used to study a variety of aeroelastic problems, including the typical section model
[19–21].
In this work a vortex lattice formulation is used to represent the aerodynamics,
and balanced model reduction is applied to generate a reduced-order model. The
vortex-lattice approach admits general non-harmonic motions, as well as harmonic
oscillations and can be extended to airfoils with more complex geometries. Balanced
model reduction retains ﬁdelity in the aerodynamic model with respect to external
effects on the structure. Extensions of this type of model reduction to larger and more
complex ﬂuid dynamic models is an active area of research [22–24].

The ﬂuid is assumed to be incompressible, irrotational, and inviscid. Following the
development in [25] the 2D airfoil and a ﬁnite portion of the wake behind the airfoil
is divided into N equal length elements, as shown in Fig. 5. Each panel element has
a point vortex of strength γ at the quarter chord and a collocation point at the three-
quarter-chord. The 2D wash at the collocation points on the airfoil can be described
by the potential equation,

(28)
where the wash, wi is described at M points on the airfoil, and inﬂuenced by vortex
strength γ j both on the airfoil (1 ≤j ≤M) and in the wake (M + 1 ≤j ≤N). For
a 2D system the kernel function Ki j is given by,
Ki j =
1
2π(xi −ζ j)
(29)
where xi and ζ j are the ith wash collocation and jth point vortex locations, respec-
tively.
The ﬁrst wake term, γ n
M+1, is given by the time rate of change of the circulation
about the airfoil, as shown in (30). The vorticity simply convects along the wake
with the freestream, as in (31). Since the wake is ﬁnite, vorticity on the ﬁnal wake
element is allowed to accumulate with a relaxation factor ˆα < 1, as given in (32).

along with (28) constitute N linear equations in the N unknowns γi. The set of N

(33)
where A ∈RN×N, B ∈RN×M are constants,  = [γ1, γ2, . . . γn]T is a state vector.
The input to this system is the normal wash and is fully deﬁned by the airfoil motion.
Enforcing a non-penetration condition on the airfoil, for the geometry of Fig. 4 and
small angle conditions, the wash is given by,
w j =

for x j < c
(α + β)U + (˙α + ˙β)(x j −e) + ˙h

(34)
Finally, outputs from the aerodynamic model relevant to the coupled system are the
moment about the elastic axis, moment about the ﬂap hinge, and the lift. These can
be calculated as,

The discretization of these integrals yields the expression of lift and moments as
linear sums of γi and so forms an output equation for the state model,
y = Cn + Dwn
(37)
where the outputs are lift and moments, y =
Mα, Mβ, LT .
3.3
Balanced Model Reduction
The model described by (33) and (37) is conveniently in the form of a discrete-time
state-space system. This model can be converted to continuous-time, and coupled
directly with (25) for aeroelastic analysis. However the vortex lattice model can be
quite large, with a state for each discrete vortex. For efﬁcient control design this
model needs to be reduced to one of lower order.

546
R. Clark
One method of model reduction is to transform the aerodynamic model into a
new coordinate system where the new states are orthogonal distributions of vorticity,
ordered by their coupling to the input/output mapping. Such an ordering is achieved
by transformation of the model into balanced coordinates. Model reduction then
involves simply truncating the less important states.
For the reduced model to be applicable to the widest range of conditions it is
useful to non-dimensionalize the inputs and outputs before balancing. Here we take
non-dimensional time to be s = tU/b and the non-dimensional input from the airfoil
to be,
ˆu =

α, β, h

To illustrate the level of model reduction possible, a vortex lattice model was
constructed for a simple ﬂat plate airfoil with 20 vortices along the plate, and an
additional 160 vortices in the wake. Figure 6 shows the Hankel singular values for
each state in the balanced system. Since the states are ordered, simply truncating the
model will yield a reduced order model whose magnitude error is, at worst, twice

the sum of the truncated Hankel singular values [9]. Therefore, if a system Ga is a

(40)
where σi is the ith Hankel singular value. For practical purposes states whose con-
tribution to the input/output map is three or four orders of magnitude below the
dominant state may be truncated without signiﬁcant errors. For the simple ﬂat-plate
airfoil a 5th order model was realized, corresponding to truncating all states whose
contribution was three orders of magnitude down from the dominant state. The error
bound for this case, calculated as twice the sum of the truncated singular values,
is 1.6%. This is an upper bound on magnitude error (over all frequencies) in the
prediction of lift and moment outputs, from harmonic plunge and pitch inputs.

Combined Aeroelastic Model
The structural and aerodynamic models developed above can be coupled to form a
model for the aeroelastic system. At a given ﬂowspeed the dynamics are linear, and
we can use eigenvalues of the system to assess stability properties. Figure 8 shows
a root locus type plot of the system’s eigenvalues as ﬂowspeed is varied. The two
oscillatory poles are related to the pitch and plunge dynamics of the typical section
model. The real poles, and others outside the range of the plot, are related to ﬂap
dynamics and to the 5th order reduced-order aerodynamic model. For this example,
the typical section has an elastic axis at 0.4 semichords forward of the center, and
ﬂap hinge 0.6 semichords aft of the center. Mass and inertial properties are also
chosen as in reference [19], where a similar analysis is done using both an analytic
solution to the aerodynamics and an approximation using rational functions. The
results here, which are based on the reduced order vortex lattice code, compare well
with these previous results. This root locus plot shows a behavior typical of bending-
torsion ﬂutter. From an undamped structural model, the initial effect of ﬂow is to
add damping to the all the modes. As the frequencies of pitch and plunge dominated
motions coalesce the lower frequency becomes undamped, eventually destabilizing
at the ﬂutter boundary.
Finally, although the dynamics predicted by this model are linear it is possible to
incorporate structural non-linearities into the model without dramatically changing
the formulation. Previous studies on a typical section model [20, 21, 26] have shown
a nonlinear spring response in the ﬂap will produce limit-cycle behavior at ﬂowspeeds
well below the linear ﬂutter boundary. To incorporate such an effect into the model it

is useful to isolate the nonlinearity as a feedback effect. This corresponds to having a
nominal linear model in an LFT conﬁguration with the nonlinearity. In the structural
model of (25) the ﬂap spring stiffness, Kβ, can be set to zero, and its effect replaced
with an outer feedback loop between ﬂap position and the moment applied to the
ﬂap. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 9, where the nonlinearity is deadband in
the response of the ﬂap spring.
This system has two distinct linear regions. Within the deadband region it appears
that there is no physical restoring spring in the ﬂap position, and outside the region
it has the a nominal stiffness Kβ. The switching between these systems, however, is
discontinuous and occurs twice per ﬂap oscillation. The dynamics, therefore, exhibit
a variety of nonlinear behavior. The work here uses physical parameters as in Table 1,
consistent with those used in [20] and a 5th order aerodynamic model as described
above. The simulations were executed directly from the diagram of Fig. 9 using inte-
gration routines within the commercially available (Mathworks, Inc.) Simulink
software. With the deadband set to zero, the system was linear and had a predicted

Development of a Delta Wing Model
True ﬂutter phenomena occur due to distributed ﬂexibility in an aircraft wing, condi-
tions which are only coarsely approximated by the rigid body dynamics of the typical
section model. A more realistic system, that still lends itself to analytic study, is a
uniform and ﬂexible delta wing [27, 28]. Here a delta wing model is developed which
incorporates piezoelectric sensors and actuators to allow for aeroelastic control. The
model also serves as a basic design platform for shaping the open-loop dynamics of
the structure through optimal actuator and sensor placement, as detailed in the next
section.
Basic physics of the delta wing model include the structural and transduction
device dynamics, and their interaction with the unsteady aerodynamic loads. The
structural model is readily developed through ﬁnite element analysis or an assumed
modes approach as outlined by Richard et al. [29]. For the purpose of this example,
the structural model is formed using the assumed modes method outlined in [30]. This
general approach follows the work of Anderson et al. [31] by ﬁnding the assumed
mode shapes applicable to a clamped-free-free-free (C F F F) rectangular plate and
transforming these functions into a trapezoidal domain. A one-hundred mode (two-

Aeroelastic Control
551
hundred state) model is generated with Lagrange’s equations (the products of ten
assumed chordwise and ten assumed spanwise beam modes), and the model is later
reduced to include ﬁfty states.
Initially, the out-of-plane assumed modal displacements of a rectangular C F F F
plate are represented as the product of clamped-free (η) and free-free (μ) beam
modes for a given assumed plate mode (i) as in Eq. 42, where the i indice extends
over all combinations of j and k. These beam mode products are used for simplicity
since they satisfy the geometric (and natural) boundary conditions for the C F F F
plate.
i(x, y) = η j(x)μk(y)
(42)
The beam modes are deﬁned based upon the general beam solution Eq. (43) with
boundary conditions speciﬁc to the problem.
W(x) = A1sin(γix) + A2cos(γix) + A3sinh(γix) + A4cosh(γix)
(43)
The free-free case requires: W ′′(0) = 0, W ′′′(0) = 0, W ′′(L) = 0, and W ′′′(L) = 0,
giving the mode shapes described in Eq. (44). The clamped-free case requires the
conditions: W(0) = 0, W ′(0) = 0, W ′′(L) = 0, and W ′′′(L) = 0, which yields the
mode shapes described by Eq. (45). The eigenvalues are represented by parameters
α j and βk, and Lx and L y are the x and y dimensions of the plate.
η j(x) = cos(α jx) + cosh(α jx) + A[sin(α jx) + sinh(α j y)]
A =
cos(α j Lx) −cosh(α j Lx)
sin(α j Lx) −sinh(α j Lx)

(44)
μk(y) = cos(βk y) + cosh(βk y) + B [−sin(βk y) + sinh(βk y)]
B =
 sin(βkL y) −sinh(βkL y)
cos(βkL y) + cosh(βkL y)

(45)
Using the assumed mode shapes developed for the rectangular plate, a coordinate
transformation is performed to map them into non-dimensional trapezoidal coordi-
nates. The transformation is shown in Fig. 11. The transformation is normalized by
span (Sp) and root chord (C) dimensions to yield a unit square, and the taper ratio
(T R) is deﬁned as the tip chord dimension divided by the root chord. By this deﬁ-
nition, the delta wing would have a taper ratio of zero but numerical considerations
limit this value to a ﬁnite taper ratio: T R = ϵ > 0. In addition to this transformation,
the Jacobian is required due to integration of the shape functions necessary in the
model development. Allowing for the intermediate step of non-dimensionalizing x
and y by C and Sp respectively (yielding ˆx and ˆy), the Jacobian is deﬁned as follows:

These transformations along with the Jacobian allow for the integration of assumed

tions used to develop the equations of motion.
Upon developing expressions for the kinetic and potential energy, Lagrange’s
equations Eq. (24) can be applied to obtain the structural equations of motion, which
upon solving the discrete eigenvalue problem resulting from the assumed-modes
approach, can be expressed in the following well recognized form:

with r and R representing modal states and forces. The ζ matrix is a diagonal rep-
resentation of approximate proportional modal damping coefﬁcients, introduced to
bound the response at resonance, and ω is the matrix of system natural frequencies.
For the example presented, the geometric and material parameters were selected
to model a wing of appropriate mass and stiffness to facilitate experimental imple-
mentation in the low-speed wind tunnel located at Duke University (Table 2). These
parameters correspond to a model of appropriate dimensions and sufﬁcient ﬂexibil-
ity to produce ﬂutter within the operating range of the wind tunnel. The material
properties were obtained from [32] as average properties for acrylic.

Transducer Effects
To complete the design model, one must incorporate the dynamics of the transduc-
tion devices. Here, induced-strain, surface-mounted, piezoelectric transducers were
selected for actuators and sensors.
A technique for incorporating the electro-mechanical coupling effects of surface
mounted piezostructures was developed in [33]. A brief presentation of the model
is discussed herein; however greater details of the modeling speciﬁc to the example
here can be found in [34]. The piezoelectric patches relate to the structure through
the  and C p matrices shown in Eqs. (48) and (49).

The general deﬁnitions of the  and C p matrices are shown in Eqs. (50) and (51),
with the ﬁrst part of the integrand in Eq. (50) representing the mechanical portion
and the later electrical part being coupled to it through the piezoelectric material
constant matrix, eT . The Mp and K p terms in Eqs. (48) and (49) represent the mass
and stiffness characteristics of the patches and are generally small compared to the
corresponding terms for the wing structure. The details of Eqs. (50) and (51) can be
found in [33] or [30].

These equations can be substantially simpliﬁed for cases involving thin patches
with symmetric strain constants (d31 = d32), which are part of the eT and εS terms.
The simpliﬁed equations are taken from [30] and are shown in Eqs. (52) and (53) for
mode j. In the simpliﬁed  equation, the electro-mechanical coupling constant is
composed of the piezoelectric strain constant for the x and y directions, the piezo-
electric modulus of elasticity and the Poisson’s ratio (d31, E p, νp). The integrated
potential distribution term consists of the plate and patch thicknesses, (hs, h p), and
the chord length, (C). The integrand involves only the jth mode shape function for
the plate with the limits of integration corresponding to the x and y domains of the
patch. The full matrix has rows corresponding to particular modes ( j) and columns
corresponding to patches (m). For this simpliﬁed case, the capacitance function (C p)
forms a diagonal matrix whose entries consist of the piezoelectric-dielectric con-
stants, area, and thicknesses (εS
m, Apm, h pm). The diagonal nature of Eq. (53) reﬂects
the fact that capacitance is only relevant for the collocated sensoriactuator case (i.e.,
when the transducer is used for both sensing and actuation [35].)

These equations are used to model the effect of piezoelectric patches (sensors or
actuators) mounted on the delta wing structure. The computational difﬁculties in this
approach result from the integral in Eq. (52). As long as the patches are rectangu-
lar and orthogonal to the base, simple numerical integration schemes can be used.
However, for calculating odd-shaped, rotated, or numerous patches, straightforward
use of this method is too computationally intensive.
To address this issue, a contiguous grid was developed over the entire surface
of the wing [36]. A compromise between computational efﬁciency and accuracy
determines the resolution of the grid. The general idea is to save, in advance, the
calculated electromechanical coupling characteristics of very small piezoelectric
elements, which can be used later, through numerical integration, to compute the
electromechanical coupling coefﬁcient for individual actuator or sensor patches.
The size of these elements allow for further simpliﬁcation of Eq. (52) as shown in
Eq. (54). The justiﬁcation for this is quite straightforward. If the individual elements
used to represent a distributed sensor or actuator are sufﬁciently small compared to
the wavelengths of the modes of interest, a zero-order approximation to the integral
can be used. Therefore, by taking the value of the shape function at the center of an

element (xc, yc) and multiplying by the area (AE), the integral can be approximated
as follows:

Due to the linear nature of the electro-mechanical coupling effects of the patches,
large patches can be constructed by summing the effects of elements within the
large patch boundaries as illustrated in Eq. (55) with the variables m and E
corresponding to an overall patch and its component elements respectively, and N
being the number of constituent elements. Similarly, the capacitance effects can be
determined by summing the component element capacitance effects. Since all of the
elements are of constant dimensions, the capacitance is the same for all elements and
the summation reduces to the simple expression of Eq. (56).
m =

Using this approach allows for the necessary element characteristics to be cal-
culated once for a given wing geometry. The process requires that the E and C pE
vectors be calculated for all of the elements and saved for later patch construction.
The computational advantages gained from this approach result from the fact that
much of the required computations are performed outside of the optimization routine
- apriori. Thus, the cost of calculating the elements’ coupling does not factor into
the efﬁciency needs of the algorithm. Computational gains and modeling errors that
result from this approach can be found in the work of Richard [34] (Fig. 13).

Aerodynamic Model, 3D
A reduced order aerodynamic model was developed based upon the vortex lattice
approach. Thus, assumptions include subsonic, inviscid, incompressible, and irrota-
tional ﬂow as has been previously discussed in this chapter and book. The ﬁrst step
in the process is to develop a grid for the wing and wake as illustrated in Fig. 14
with vorticity points at the quarter chord, and downwash observation points at the
three-quarter chord of each grid block. The grid is structured such that the grid blocks
are of like size and shape in the unit square computational domain consistent with the
structural model. The grid used in this example has 8 chordwise blocks, 15 spanwise
blocks, and 4 chords of wake leading to a model with 600 vorticity states.
As detailed in the previous section, the order of this model can be readily reduced
using balanced realization theory. Applying this model reduction technique, it was
possible to reduce the number of states included in the aerodynamic model from 600
to 50. The relative magnitudes of the balanced system Gramians (i.e., the HSVs) are
illustrated in Fig. 15. The sum of all of the truncated Gramians totals less than 5%
of the non-truncated Gramian sum.

Coupled System
The aeroelastic system is developed by coupling the structural and aerodynamic
models through feedback. The two systems were constructed with this goal in mind
and their input/output requirements were modeled so as to facilitate this step. Once
coupled, the model can be used to predict characteristics such as ﬂutter speed, ﬂutter
frequency, mode shape progression with ﬂow, and general system response traits for
any ﬂow speed below the linear instability boundary. It is now possible to use this
model to predict the onset of ﬂutter (based on the assumption of linear instability
being the driving mechanism). By plotting the aeroelastic system roots at progres-
sively increasing ﬂow speeds, trends of root migration can be followed that clearly
show the roots of the second mode moving into the right half plane (Fig. 16). In
contrast, each of the other modes show substantially increased damping, and thus,
reducedresponse. Theinstabilitytakes placeat aﬂowspeedof 31.5m/s for thesystem
parameters outlined in Table 2. Although the non-linear effects involved with ﬂutter
can be expected to somewhat alter the frequency of oscillation, it can be expected to
be in the vicinity of the 18 Hz prediction of the linear model.
The aeroelastic model can also be used to predict the progression of mode shapes
with increasing ﬂow speed. Since the root migration identiﬁes the second mode as the
mode of interest, the emphasis here is placed on how that mode shape changes as the
system approaches ﬂutter. The areas of lowest average maximum displacements are
shown in Fig. 17 with respect to increasing ﬂow speed. This ﬁgure clearly shows the
nodal centers moving toward the interior of the wing as the ﬂow speed is increased.

This pre-ﬂutter, combined torsional/bending mode, in addition to the clear trend
shown in Fig. 16, points to the fact that ﬂutter results from a coalescence of the
ﬁrst structural mode (primarily bending) and the second structural mode (primarily
torsional). This is consistent with the concept of modal coalescence described in this
text. There is also the implication that the ideal placement of sensors and actuators
for control of this mode should change between the no-ﬂow case and the pre-ﬂutter
case.

Open-Loop Design Considerations
In a feedback control system, the actuator input signals are created by modifying the
temporal response of the sensor signals with a compensator. The optimum controller
- temporal compensator, is usually realized by frequency-shaping the system open-
and closed-loop transfer functions [30]. Although much can be accomplished with
the optimization (and in practice the iterative tuning) of a control law, the ﬁnal
performance of a system depends very much on how difﬁcult the problem is to begin
with. Previous work in adaptive structures has also shown that optimum compensator
design may be augmented by considering the design of the spatial compensator of
the control system [30]. Spatial compensation is deﬁned as the inﬂuence of the type,
placement, size, and shape of the transducers on the open-loop response and, as a
result, the closed-loop temporal compensator design. When combined, the temporal
and spatial compensator’s form the complete control system for any structure.

Aeroelastic Control
559
While much of an airframe design may be ﬁxed by other criteria, the choice
of actuator and sensor locations is often determined by a combination of physical
restraints and requirements of the control system. These choices frame the dynamics,
and if possible, it is best to make those decisions an integral part of the design, with
an eye toward the ﬁnal control objectives. The Hankel Singular Values (HSVs) that
play a key role in model reduction can also be utilized early in the design to facilitate
the choice of actuator and sensor locations.
HSVs and the Modal Model
In models with lightly damped dynamics the HSVs can be related directly to modal
parameters through a very simple expression. For the purpose of development, cast
the structural model from the actuator input, u(t), to the measured output of the
sensor, y(t), in modal form such that
¨q + diag(2ζiωi)˙q + diag(ω2
i )q = ˆBu
y = ˆCq
(57)
where ωi and ζi are the natural frequency and damping ratio of the ith mode,
respectively. Deﬁning the state vector as
x = [˙q1, ω1q1, . . . , ˙qNm, ωNmqNm]T
(58)
produces a state space representation such that
˙x = Ax + Bu
y = Cx
(59)
where A = diag(Ai), B = [BT

where bT

Williams [37] demonstrated that the square of the ith HSV of a lightly damped
structure can be approximated by the following expression:

where σi is the approximation of the ith HSV. As indicated in Eq. (63), the ith HSV
is proportional to the time constant (τi = 1/(ζiωi)) of the ith structural mode and
the modal participation coefﬁcients for each actuator and sensor. The numerator of
Eq. (63) thus provides a measure of the degree of coupling between the actuator
inputs and measured outputs relative to the structural modes. Physically, the HSV is
a measure of the amount of energy that can be stored in the system from the inputs
and the amount of energy that can be retrieved by the outputs [38]. Thus, the HSV can
be used to measure the effectiveness of a particular actuator/sensor pair for coupling,
or not coupling, to structural modes.
Fromapracticalperspective,itshouldbenotedthatnotallmodelscanbedescribed
purely in modal form, and in fact, most experimental models, obtained from system
identiﬁcation, will often incorporate ﬁrst-order dynamics as well with real poles.
However, when optimizing actuator/sensor designs, one usually targets the lightly
damped modes of the system since the actuator/sensor design is an integral part of
the structural dynamics. Thus, one can effectively ignore the ﬁrst order dynamics in
this portion of the design, but certainly not in the design of the temporal compensator.
4.1
Optimization Strategy
There are numerous means for optimization; however, the one thing common to all
schemes is the choice of the cost function, which effectively deﬁnes the problem.
Since the Hankel singular values provide a measure of the degree of coupling for a
chosen path, one must decide how to use this information in design.
The design metric for frequency-shaping with spatial compensators is developed
from the work presented by Smith and Clark [39], Clark and Cox [40], Lim [41], and
Lim and Gawronski [42]. As detailed in these references, methods for optimizing or
selecting the appropriate spatial aperture (i.e, size and location) of actuators and sen-
sors using Hankel singular values of the open-loop controllability and observability
Gramians are developed.
The ﬁrst step in developing any compensator design metric is to cast the control
problem into proper form. Figure 18 shows a block diagram of the two-port or two-
input, two-output (TITO) closed-loop system. The system T (s) is composed of the
generalized plant, P(s), with controller, K(s). The transfer matrix P(s) in Fig. 18
represents the dynamics of the adaptive structure and transducer coupling, and is
written in equation form as:
 z(s)

(64)

Aeroelastic Control
561
Fig. 18 Block diagram of generalized plant with feedback controller
As shown by Fig. 18 and Eq. (64), P(s) is partitioned according to the input-output
variables, and four sub-matrices are identiﬁed. The upper-left transfer matrix, Pzw,
represents the path from the input disturbance signals to the measured performance.
The lower-right transfer matrix, Pyu, is the path from the input actuator signal to
the response of the sensor, and is determined by the selection of transducer type,
placement, size, and/or shape. The cross transfer matrices Pzu and Pyw show that
the design of the control transducers also affects system performance and that the
disturbance signals affect the measured outputs, respectively.
Each transfer matrix is formed from the states of the system and the respective
input-output characteristics. When optimized, the design of the spatial compensators
ideally alters the coupling characteristics of the system for increased performance
and robustness.
The Hankel singular values (HSVs) from the input actuator signal to the sensor
output are written as
σyu = diag(σyu1, . . . , σyun, . . . , σyuNm).
(65)
The HSVs deﬁned by Eq. (65) provide a measure of the degree of coupling between
each of the Nm modes associated with the transducer path of the control problem.
A spatial compensator design metric based entirely upon evaluating Eq. (65) was
presented by Lim and Gawronski [42]. In this case, the HSVs deﬁned by Eq. (65)
were computed from a predetermined set of candidate transducer locations and the
optimum location is deﬁned by the path which provided the greatest HSV measure-
ment. The conclusion being that selecting transducer locations with the largest degree
of coupling increases control system efﬁciency and, thus, performance.
Lim [41] recognized that the purpose of the control problem deﬁned in Fig. 18 is to
reduce/control the measure of performance, z(s), and that Eq. (65) could be weighted
by a measure of the system performance to provide for spatial compensator designs
that are efﬁcient at coupling the modes with the greatest effect on the measured
performance.

562
R. Clark
Again using HSVs, a measure of the degree of coupling of each mode associated
with the performance-disturbance path, Pzw, is
zw = diag(σzw1, . . . , σzwn, . . . , σzwNm)
(66)
and the design metric deﬁned by Lim [41] is written as
Jqp ≡

i=1
σ 2
ypuqi
¯σ 2

(67)
where Jqp is the metric for the q-th candidate sensor and p-th candidate actuator.
The value ¯σ 2
yui is the squared HSVs of the system where all possible actuators and
sensors are considered; it is used to normalize the HSV calculations. As shown in
[41], Eq. (67) is a computationally efﬁcient means of determining transducer designs
that increase system performance.
Based upon Eq. (67), Clark and Cox [40] developed a design metric which also
provided for system robustness. This metric emphasizes coupling to modes within the
bandwidth of control, but de-emphasizes coupling to modes outside the performance
bandwidth. This metric was later reﬁned by Smith and Clark [39] as well as Richard
and Clark [34]. Deﬁning a binary selection vector with 1’s corresponding to the tar-
geted modes of the system and 0’s elsewhere, a metric can be developed to emphasize
actuator/sensor selection that provides desired coupling to select modes and effec-
tively penalizes coupling to modes unimportant in the control system design. Thus,
one can effectively impose a level of roll-off in the frequency response by penalizing
coupling to higher-order modes. This can be readily implemented by constructing
binary selection vectors related to modes desired for performance, per f (with unity
on-switches and zeros as off-switches), and a binary selection vector to identify
modes unimportant for performance, identiﬁed as robust here. It should be noted
that an ideal actuator/sensor choice would be one that coupled only to the modes
desired for enhanced control system performance. This would lead to an identiﬁed
system model with very few modes in the identiﬁed path and thus a low-order com-
pensator – an inherently simpler design problem. The two metrics (desirable and
undesirable) can be expressed in terms of the HSVs as follows:
Jper f =

(69)
These two metrics yield scores for a given actuator/sensor pair that correspond to
their beneﬁcial and detrimental modal coupling. Note that each metric is normalized
by ¯σyui, which as detailed by Lim, represents the root-mean-square of the sum of

Aeroelastic Control
563
the HSVs over all possible actuator-sensor paths for a given mode. This approach
works well when one is trying to select an actuator and sensor from a ﬁxed array
of candidate sensors and actuators (i.e., when all possible actuator-sensor paths are
known in advance). However, when designing without such constraints, one must
provide a normalizing estimate, and the simplest estimate is to use the maximum for
each mode over a given set of actuator-sensor candidates. This does not guarantee
that the normalized metric will be less than unity, but it will be of order unity for
scaling purposes. The performance metric used in the delta wing model presented
can be expressed as follows:
J = Jper f
Jrobust
(70)
Thus, J is maximized when Jper f is large and Jrobust is small, indicating that the
actuator-sensor path maximizes coupling to the desired modes and minimizes cou-
pling to modes that are not important for controlling the desired dynamic response
of the structure.
4.2
Optimization Results
A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the design of the actuator and sensor
concurrently so as to achieve the desired coupling and decoupling to modes within
the bandwidth of interest. Details of the optimization can be found in the work of
Richard [34]. However, the primary mode targeted for coupling is the second mode
since this mode is observed to destabilize as the ﬂutter boundary is approached. Cou-
pling to higher order modes (greater than the sixth mode) is penalized to impose a
level of roll-off in the frequency response from input to output and reduce coupling
to modes unimportant for control. Coupling to other structural modes (below mode
seven) is neither emphasized or penalized so as not to overly constrain the design.
Thus per f = [0 1 0 0 . . . ] and robust = [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 . . . ]. A genetic algo-
rithm was structured so as to allow for optimization of the angle of orientation and
dimensions of the actuator and sensor. For the case presented, the dimensions of the
actuator were constrained to a maximum of 2 inches in both x and y.
The initial conditions for actuator and sensor dimensions and orientation were
selected arbitrarily, and hundreds of cases were executed to determine if the opti-
mization would lead to similar results. The design results are presented in Fig. 19.
Several design results are depicted in this ﬁgure, and it should be noted that the
results emphasized in bold are representative of the design used for the experimental
test system. The optimal actuators are located closest to the leading edge of the delta
wing and the sensors are depicted near the trailing edge. The dominant peak in the
frequency response corresponds to the second structural mode, and the diminished
coupling at higher frequency is readily noted, which is a form of “loop-shaping”
by design. A plot of the performance metric as a function of the number of itera-

Control Law Design
The general diagram of Fig. 3 provides a basis for understanding much of modern
and robust control design. The control objectives are best viewed in terms of the
transfer function path through the system Tzw. This path is deﬁned by the control
designer and not limited by physical inputs or outputs of the system. Through the
application of static, or possibly dynamic, weighting functions on this path a wide
variety of possible performance objectives may be deﬁned.
With  = 0 the problem of ﬁnding a K that minimizes the performance path
∥Tzw∥is a linear optimal control problem. With appropriately chosen inputs, w, and
outputs, z, minimizing the H2 norm is equivalent to the linear quadratic regulator
problem with optimal estimation (LQR/LQG) [43]. In addition to minimizing ∥Tzw∥
when  = 0, requiring stability for the interconnection Fl(Fu(T, ), K) for non-
zero  is the robust control problem. Typically,  is an unknown but norm bounded
and the problem is scaled such that ∥∥∞< 1. Then the stability requirement can be

Aeroelastic Control
565
enforced (with some conservatism) by the small-gain condition ∥Tqv∥∞< 1. This
forms the basis of robust control design via H∞methods [9].
In both the case of quadratic regulation and robust control the optimization prob-
lem is to ﬁnd a state-space system K that will minimize ∥Tzw∥. With the controller K
an LTI model of the same order as the augmented plant matrix T , this optimization
problem reduces to the solution of two coupled second order algebraic equations,
called Riccati equations. Although the algebraic Riccati equations must be evalu-
ated numerically, efﬁcient procedures exist to do this and the time required to solve
the problem depends on the order of the system, and not the problem data. This
avoids some of the pitfalls of nonlinear optimization, and helps account for the wide
generality of modern control theory.
In this section quadratic optimal control laws (the H2 problem) are posed for both
the typical section and delta wing models. Rationale for the system augmentation
and control weightings are detailed and predicted extension of the ﬂutter boundary
under active control is shown for both models.
5.1
Control of the Typical Section Model
Consider the typical section model deﬁned above with the trailing edge ﬂap as the
control surface and position measurements available from each axis.
The control design includes weights typical of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
control laws, including a trade-off between performance and control effort and
between sensor noise and process noise. This basic design technique has been suc-
cessfullyappliedtoatypicalsection airfoilunderavarietyofexperimentalconditions
[44–46].
Pitch-plunge coupling is known to be the ﬂutter mechanism in this system, with
the system destabilizing quickly (with respect to variations in ﬂow speed) after the
frequencies of these motions coalesce. With the goal of extending the ﬂutter boundary
areasonablecontrolobjectivewouldbetoreducecouplinginthesystemforthemodel
just below the ﬂutter boundary. To achieve this an objective function, Tzw, is deﬁned
as the transfer function from a disturbance in plunge to the response in pitch. This
will cause the control action to try and alter dynamics of the closed-loop system such
that the coupling between these motions is reduced. Without further augmentation,
however, the optimization problem is not well posed. The coupling can be made very
small, but this will require control authority exceeding that available from the ﬂap.
To limit control effort, outputs of the the objective path, Tzw, are augmented with the
control signal. In a similar fashion the plunge disturbance input is augmented with
additive inputs at the sensors, and this is used to reduce the sensitivity of the control
action to sensor noise.
Figure 20 shows the problem in block diagram form, with the design weights
shown as triangular signal gain blocks. Without loss of generality the performance
weight, Q, and the level of disturbance input Qw can be set to unity, as these weights
are trade-offs in the optimization problem with the control effort R and sensor noise

Qv, respectively. The sensor noise level Qv was set independently for each channel,
and at a level which gives a physically appropriate sensor/noise ratio. Here, given
the resonate response near the ﬂutter boundary, the sensor noise is scaled to be two
orders of magnitude below the peak harmonic response at the sensors from a unit
disturbance input. The only remaining design freedom is the level of the control
effort penalty. This was determined through iterative design, checking closed-loop
response to ensure the system does not saturate the control surface, in either harmonic
or transient response.
In Fig. 21 the open and closed loop transfer functions are shown from the distur-
bance (a force in plunge) to the change in angle of attack. Although the closed loop
response is still lightly damped, it is signiﬁcantly attenuated due to the action of con-
trol. Therefore, although this model may not have signiﬁcantly more damping than
the open-loop model, the attenuated coupling should allow for an increased ﬂutter
boundary. The root loci of Fig. 22 conﬁrms that this is the case. Under closed loop
control the ﬂutter boundary is extended by 19% to 27.8 m/s, and the locus is altered
such that ﬂowspeed variations cause a change in frequency, rather than damping, in
the region near the design condition.
There are, however, some obvious limitations to this approach. In the design only
the performance of the control law at a single ﬂowspeed is considered. By choosing
an open-loop model near the ﬂutter boundary we have operated on a critical region,
however, at points off of this ﬂow condition the performance is not optimized. From
the loci in Fig. 22 it can be seen that the closed loop system is actually unstable for all
ﬂowspeeds up to 11.2 m/s. Also, although the ﬂutter boundary is extended damping
is actually decreased at most ﬂowspeeds in the closed-loop response. In practice
this may lead to unacceptably large vibrations, or show a sensitivity to model errors.
Some of this could be addressed by tuning the control weights and by including
additional transfer functions in the performance path. However, as will be seen in a
later section, by using linear parameter varying models and convex optimization for
the control design it is possible to incorporate eigenvalue constraints directly and to
optimize performance over a range of ﬂow conditions.

Control of the Delta Wing Model
Through H2-synthesis, a temporal compensator can be designed so as to minimize
the response of the second mode in order to extend the ﬂutter boundary. Since the
dynamics of the system vary as a function of ﬂow-speed, one must select a ﬂow
speed for design unless gain scheduling is incorporated. For the example presented,
the pre-ﬂutter condition of 30 m/s was selected for design.
Figure 20 shows the H2 design problem in block diagram form as detailed in the
previous section. Control design for the delta wing is consistent with the approach
outlined for the typical section model, and uses the same system augmentation in

deﬁning the optimization path Tzw. The performance weight, Q, and the level of
disturbance input Qw are again set to unity. The sensor noise level Qv was set at
a level which gives a physically appropriate sensor/noise ratio, approximately two
orders of magnitude below the peak response.
Given that the actuator-sensor path was designed so as to provide roll-off at higher
frequencies, this results in a control design that effectively precludes any signiﬁcant
emphasis on high-frequency dynamics since the signal to noise ratio is poor by design
at higher frequencies . The remaining degree of freedom in design is the level of the
control effort penalty. An iterative design process was conducted, checking closed-
loop response to ensure the system does not saturate the piezoelectric transducer.
Results illustrating the migration of the closed-loop poles as a function of ﬂow-
speed are depicted in Fig. 23 along with the migration of the open-loop poles. As
indicated, the predicted instability of the closed-loop system occurs at a ﬂow-speed
of 39 m/s, yielding a 20% extension of the ﬂutter boundary.

Parameter Varying Models
Gain scheduling of control laws is a technique for overcoming some of the limitations
of single-point designs, and has been successfully applied in a variety of aerospace
and industrial systems [47]. Of relatively recent interest in control theory is the use
of Linear Matrix Inequalities to design gain-scheduled controllers [48, 49] using an

Aeroelastic Control
569
extension of linear models to systems with linear or afﬁne parametric dependence.
Such models are called Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) and take the form,
S(θ) =
 A(θ) B(θ)
C(θ) D(θ)

(71)
for a parameter vector θ ∈RN. Since the dependence of the state matrices on θ is
afﬁne we can write,
S(θ) = S0 +
N

i=1

(72)
This structure includes a much wider range of dynamic models than LTI systems,
and provides acceptable approximations to many nonlinear problems of engineering

6.1
Linear Matrix Inequalities
The design of LPV gain-scheduled control laws follows a similar development as
linear optimal control, but the optimization problem results in a series of linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs) as constraints, with an objective function that is linear
or afﬁne in the problem’s unknowns. With constraints posed as an LMI, or combi-
nations of LMIs, the resulting optimization problems are convex, and very efﬁcient
numerical techniques exist for their solution [50, 51]. The development of control
synthesis methods using LMIs is an active area of research and will be summa-
rized only brieﬂy here. The interested reader is referred to the references for back-
ground on the use of LMIs in system theory [52–54], the formulation of LMI control
objectives [55–58], and the design of gain-scheduled controllers for LPV systems
[48, 49, 59, 60].
ALinearMatrixInequality(LMI)isasystemofequationsinwhichsomeunknown
or decision variable is written as an afﬁne function of symmetric matrix quantities.
The equation is satisﬁed if the matrix function is either strictly positive (or negative)
deﬁnite. The canonical form for such an equation is,

where x ∈Rm, and Fi = F T
i ∈Rn×n. The greater-than symbol implies that F(x) is
positive deﬁnite, that is,
qT F(x)q > 0,
∀q ∈Rn
(74)
Individual LMIs can be combined in a straightforward manner by diagonally aug-
menting the equations into a larger LMI. For example, the pair of conditions that
F(x) > 0 and G(x) < 0 can be written as the single LMI,
F(x)
0
0
−G(x)


(75)
All LMIs can be written in the canonical form of (73), however, sometimes these
equations arise more naturally in matrix form with the unknowns appearing as ele-
ments of a symmetric matrix. So long as products of unknowns do not appear in
these equations, the LMIs still have a convex solution and can be transformed into
the form of (73) by ﬁnding the terms Fi as a basis for F(x) corresponding to the ith
variable [52].
6.2
LMI Controller Speciﬁcations
In this section two useful controller speciﬁcations, the H2 norm of a transfer function
and a regional pole placement condition, are developed in terms of linear matrix
inequalities involving the state-space models. With these criteria deﬁned in terms
of LMIs, it will be possible to pose convex optimization problems for control laws
which address the issues of control design for various ﬂow conditions and allow
direct control over system eigenvalues.
The H2 norm of a system is the sum of the root-mean-square (RMS) responses to
unit impulses and can be written,
∥G∥2 =

where ˆyi is the response to a unit impulse δ(t) on the ith input. For a ﬁnite H2 norm
the system’s feed through matrix D must be zero, and the output is given by,
ˆyi(t) = CeAt Biδ(t).
(77)
Substituting ˆy into (76) yields,

(78)
where Wo, the observability Gramian, is calculated as the solution to the following
Lyapunov equation,
AT Wo + Wo A + CT C = 0.
(79)
Therefore, a system’s H2 norm will be below a level, γ , if a solution P > 0 exists
such that,
AT P + P A + CT C < 0
(80)
trace BT P B < γ 2
(81)
Making the variable substitution Q = P−1 and introducing a free variable Z > 0
this condition can be written,
Q AT + AQ + QCT C Q < 0
BT Q−1B −Z < 0
trace Z < γ 2
(82)
Finally, the Schur complement (see e.g. [52]) of (82) yields the following LMIs,
AQ + Q AT QCT
C Q
−I


Z BT
B Q

> 0,
trace Z < γ 2
(83)
which are jointly convex in the unknowns Q, Z, and γ 2.
Existence of Q > 0 and Z > 0 that satisfy the inequalities in (83) establish that
the system’s H2 norm is below γ . Determination of such solutions can be found
numerically as a convex feasibility problem. Furthermore, a convex optimization
problem may be posed that exploits the freedom in Q and Z to ﬁnd a minimal value
γ 2. This value of γ is the system H2 norm.
In order to address system damping directly it is desirable to specify in the con-
troller design that closed loop poles are contained in regions of the left-half plane.
Pole-placement is a traditional technique in control design, but it is seldom used
in high order systems because uniquely specifying all the eigenvalue locations pro-
duces a highly constrained problem, and can require large amounts of control effort.
Regional pole placement deﬁnes regions of the left half plane where closed loop
poles may reside, and unlike exact pole-placement allows additional design freedom
for minimizing the control effort required.

Following the development in [57, 61], let a region of the complex plane, D be
deﬁned by the symmetric matrix L, square matrix M, and the condition,
D = {z ∈C | L + Mz + MT ¯z < 0},
(84)
where ¯z is the complex conjugate of z. The matrix A will have its eigenvalues in the
region D if there exists a matrix X > 0 such that,
L ⊗X + M ⊗(AX) + MT ⊗(X AT ) < 0
(85)
where ⊗is the Kronecker product. The Kronecker product of two matrices creates
a block matrix, whose (ith, jth) block is the second operand scaled by an element of
the ﬁrst. Speciﬁcally for C = A ⊗B we have,
C =
⎡
⎢⎣
A11B · · · A1m B
...
...
...
An1B · · · Anm B
⎤
⎥⎦
(86)
Several important regions can be described by (84), for example with
L = α, M = 0
(87)
the region is deﬁned by z + ¯z < −α which requires eigenvalues to have a real com-
ponent more negative then −α/2. In this case of L = 0 the region is just the left-half
plane and the LMI condition of (85) reduces to the familiar Lyapunov equation for
stability of state-space systems,
AX + X AT < 0,
X > 0
(88)
A condition of minimum damping, ζ = cos(θ), is a region of the left half plane
bounded by cones of angle θ off the real axis. This region is described by (84) with
L = 0 and
M =

cos(θ)
−sin(θ)
−sin(θ)
cos(θ)

,
(89)
and the LMI constraint is the existence of a matrix X > 0 that solves,
sin(θ)(AX + X AT ) cos(θ)(AX −X AT )
cos(θ)(X AT −AX) sin(θ)(AX + X AT )

< 0
(90)
More complex geometries are possible with other choices for L and M, and
arbitrary convex regions can be deﬁned by looking at the intersection of the regions
outlined above. Since in all cases the constraint equation is an LMI, the solutions to
multiple constraints remains convex and numerically tractable.

6.3
An LMI Design for the Typical Section
It is possible to use these LMI equations to pose convex optimization problems and
solve for Lyapunov matrices that verify if a system’s H2 norm is below a certain
bound or its eigenvalues exist within a speciﬁed region. However, the power in
this method is not in the analysis of systems, but it is in the ability to work directly
from a set of analysis equations to pose a control synthesis problem, and to extend
this to the synthesis of controllers for parameter varying plants. There are several
additional steps which must be taken to achieve this end. Speciﬁcally these steps
are: the assumption of a common Lyapunov function for all constraints, a nonlinear
substitution of variables to restore convexity to the synthesis problem, and a ﬁnite
parameter expansion on which to gain schedule the resulting controller. We treat
these conditions only brieﬂy here, and refer the reader to the references for a more
complete development.
The synthesis of a controller requires that a single common Lyapunov function
be used to enforce the design constraints. This means that the term Q in the H2
norm bound of (83) and the term X in the pole placement criteria of (90) must be
equal. This is the primary source of conservatism in the control law synthesis. It is
possible for a system to meet both criteria, but this may not be provable with a single
Lyapunov function. Although it is difﬁcult to quantify the conservatism in general, in
practice many problems allow sufﬁcient freedom that this process, sometimes called
Lyapunov shaping, yields suitable results.
In the control synthesis problem, the system of interest for the LMI conditions is
the closed-loop model after feedback has been applied. With the controller model
unknown, this introduces additional unknowns into the LMI conditions as can be
seen from substituting (6) for the system in (83) and (90). These unknowns appear
in the equations in products with one another, and therefore the resulting matrix
inequality is not linear in the unknowns and cannot be solved by convex optimization.
However, as was developed in [58], a combination of congruence transformation and
substitutionofvariablesexistswhichconvertsthisproblemintoonewhichhasalinear
dependence on a new set of unknowns. Once solved this variable substitution can be
inverted to yield a state-space model for the controller.
The extension of the control synthesis problem to LPV models is straightforward.
Since changes in ﬂowspeed will be slow compared to the dynamics of the system
the dynamic effects due to the rate of change in ﬂowspeed can be safely ignored.
The aerodynamic model depends on ﬂowspeed and dynamic pressure, and it can be
written in state-space form in terms of an expansion with U and U 2,

The design constraints are then written for systems over a grid of speeds throughout
the range of interest. Solving the optimization problem over the grid of constraints
will yield a ﬁxed control law that can operate over this range. However, the proposed
control structure may be given the same functional dependence as the plant model,
and performance greatly improved through gain scheduling. That is, each unknown
of the optimization problem is written as a quadratic function of ﬂowspeed. This
triples the number of unknowns, but gives rise to a resulting control law that is
gain-scheduled as a function of the aerodynamics.
The procedure outlined above was followed for the typical section model, pro-
ducing a gain-scheduled controller for ﬂutter suppression, see Cox [70]. For the H2
norm condition the system was given the same performance weights as the previous
example, except now the H2 norm optimization is carried out over grid of ﬂowspeeds
extending to 30 m/s, approximately 27% past the open loop ﬂutter boundary. Fur-
thermore, the pole placement condition was also part of the constraint set and this
required that all the system’s eigenvalues have at least 5% damping throughout the
ﬂow range.
Performance of the resulting gain-scheduled controller is shown in the root locus
plot of Fig. 24 for a ﬂowspeed range of 5 m/s to 30 m/s. The ﬂowspeed range here does
not extend to zero speed, as it was too difﬁcult for the system to achieve the damping
speciﬁcation at these low ﬂowspeeds with only an inertial response from the ﬂap
actuator. The transfer function of the path from a disturbance force in plunge to the
response in pitch at a ﬂowspeed of 23 m/s is shown in Fig. 25. The peak attenuation of
this path is less than for the single objective, single-point design shown in Fig. 21. The
response, however, is much more damped due to the inclusion of the pole placement
constraint and, unlike the single-point design, well damped responses occur over the
entire range of ﬂow conditions.

Experimental Results
In this section experimental results are presented for aeroelastic control of both
the typical section and delta wing models. Physical parameters for these models
correspond to those detailed in Tables 1 and 2. The delta wing results are based
on a system with sensor and actuator placement designed for optimal coupling to
the destabilizing ﬂutter mode. The control law design is based on an identiﬁed LTI
model for a ﬂow condition just below the ﬂutter speed. The typical section design is
also based upon identiﬁed models, however, these models have an LPV form and the
design criteria includes performance speciﬁcations over a range of ﬂow conditions.
The resulting typical section control law is also in LPV form, and therefore operates
as a gain scheduled controller.
7.1
Typical Section Experiment
The typical section model provides a convenient analytic tool due to its relatively
tractable modeling, yet it exhibits may of the dynamic features of more complex
systems. Experimental investigations based on a typical section rig can also be infor-
mative, if for nothing else, in order to verify the practicality of control designs and to
expose any sensitivity in the methods to more realistic conditions. The model shown
in the photographs of Fig. 26 is a rigid airfoil with a NACA-0012 proﬁle with an

vious studies in both active control of ﬂutter [44] and in experimental investigations
of limit cycle oscillations [20, 21, 26, 62–64]. The model was mounted in the Duke
University wind tunnel in a support system that provides ﬂexible and lightly damped
response to motions in both pitch and plunge. The ﬂap was also held with a restor-
ing spring and connected to a linear induction motor for control. The model was
instrumented with variable differential transformers (RVDTs) that provide position
measurements in each axis. Physical properties for the model are similar to those
provided in Table 1, with the addition of a 0.32 Kg motor mounted near the elastic
axis.
7.2
LPV System Identiﬁcation
Under different ﬂow conditions the typical section model varies dramatically. In
order to apply system identiﬁcation, data was taken at a number of ﬂowspeeds below
the ﬂutter boundary. The system’s ﬂap actuator was driven by white noise and outputs
from the three position sensors were recorded. Independently each of these data sets
could be ﬁt quite accurately with a low order model using subspace identiﬁcation
algorithms [11, 12, 65]. However, the coordinate system used for these realizations

Aeroelastic Control
577
is not consistent and it cannot be made consistent without full measurement of the
state. Here full measurement is clearly not possible since the state includes dynamics
associated with modes of the unsteady ﬂow.
Theambiguityofcoordinatesmakesthiscollectionofidentiﬁedmodelsunsuitable
for LPV control. Solving for a parameter dependent Lyapunov function over a grid
of models is not meaningful if the internal state vector is not consistent among
these different grid points. One method to determine an LPV model that reﬂects
the experimental data is to use the identiﬁed model of the system at zero ﬂowspeed
and couple this to an analytic model for the aerodynamics. In order to couple this
model to the aerodynamic model, however, inputs are required for forces in the pitch
and plunge directions. To obtain these experimentally would require calibrated force
transducers in these directions that did not impart mass or stiffness loading to the
structure.
Here an alternative approach was taken using optimization codes designed for
tuning of speciﬁc parameters in a model [70]. The model at zero ﬂowspeed was
identiﬁed using a subspace identiﬁcation algorithm. This was reduced to 8 states with
little loss of ﬁdelity. The missing information in coupling the identiﬁed structural
model and the analytic aerodynamic model is the inﬂuence matrix, B, that deﬁnes
the effect of moment and force inputs on the identiﬁed state. Moments in the ﬂap
should closely follow inputs to the ﬂap actuator, however there is no guidance in
choosing inﬂuence coefﬁcients for forces in pitch and plunge. With the pitch and
plunge inﬂuence coefﬁcients free and the ﬂap constrained to be a scaled version of
the actuator input, the problem has 17 unknown parameters. A key to improving
the solvability of this problem was to choose a decoupled coordinate system for the
structural model. In modal coordinates the A matrix is block diagonal and the effect
of perturbations in elements of the B matrix is more clearly delineated, improving
convergence of the nonlinear optimization.
With the structural model in modal canonical form a set of parameters was found
that allowed the model to ﬁt well at a ﬂowspeed of 21 m/s. This is a condition
where the inﬂuence of aerodynamics is signiﬁcant but far enough below the ﬂutter
point where the response is not dominated by a single resonance. The model was
most accurate at this condition, however, it was still fairly accurate at other ﬂow
conditions indicating that the optimization problem was not over-parameterized. A
comparison of the experimentally determined spectra and the frequency responses
of the LPV identiﬁed model is shown in Fig. 29, at the end of this section.
Another measure of the models accuracy is is ability to predict the transition to
ﬂutter. The LPV model can be evaluated at any ﬂowspeed, and used to determine
the systems eigenvalues. Figure 27a shows a root locus for the identiﬁed model as
a function of increasing ﬂowspeed. The locus starts with lightly damped motion in
pitch, plunge and ﬂap. As ﬂow increases both initially gain damping, then the plunge
mode starts to lose damping, and eventually becomes unstable. This is similar to the
behavior of the analytic typical section model shown in Fig. 22a. The most notable
difference being the lower ﬂap frequency (due to loading from the control actuator),

model revealed that ﬂutter occurred at 25.1 m/s, slightly below the predicted ﬂutter

Closed-Loop Results
A controller was designed using the identiﬁed LPV model and following the same
multiobjective procedure described in Sect. 5. The goal was a reduced H2 transfer
function from a plunge disturbance to an output that included both pitch and plunge.
The regional pole-placement conditions were set to 5% damping in all the modes,
over a ﬂow range that extended from 8 m/s to 30 m/s. The solution to this problem
was found through convex optimization of the resulting LMIs, using semideﬁnite
programming software described in [66]. The resulting continuous controller was
discretized through a Tustin transformation, and implemented digitally at a sample
rate of 250 Hz.
A series of manual disturbance tests were performed for the open and closed loop
system at several ﬂowspeeds below the ﬂutter boundary. These results, presented in
Fig. 30, show the increase in damping of plunge motion in the closed loop system. The
damping increase is greatest at the intermediate ﬂowspeed of 16 m/s, and decreases
again at higher ﬂowspeeds. There is also an increase in the frequency of the response
with ﬂowspeed. This is consistent with the location of the dominant poles in the
predicted closed-loop root locus of Fig. 27b. The system remains stable and relatively
well damped past the open-loop ﬂutter boundary as shown in the response plots of
Fig. 28.

Finally, a white noise dither signal was added at the ﬂap for both open and closed
loop operation. This provided a calibrated input from which full bandwidth responses
could be computed from the signals auto and cross spectra. The open and closed-
loop frequency responses below the ﬂutter boundary are shown in Fig. 31. Above the
ﬂutter boundary only closed loop response is available, and this is shown in Fig. 32
(Fig. 29).

Delta Wing Experiment
Material properties for the experimental test-rig were provided in Table 2. In order
to test the no-ﬂow simulation results against experimental measurements, the test rig
is driven by an acoustic disturbance, and point velocities are measured with a laser
vibrometer (VPI 4000 scanning laser). The ﬁrst step in the process is to measure
the frequency response between the band-limited random acoustic disturbance and
point velocity measurements. From these measurements, the resonant frequencies of
the structure are easily identiﬁed. The structure is then driven with a harmonic input
corresponding to each of the measured resonant frequencies, with velocity measure-
ments being obtained over a grid covering the entire wing. These grid measurements
yield an RMS velocity magnitude map over the entire surface for a given frequency,
providing a graphical image of the mode shape. A comparison of these simulated
and measured structural mode shapes for the wing without transducers can be seen
in Fig. 33.
The frequencies of these modes, and the analytic predictions, are listed in Table 3.
Thesefrequencies provetobesomewhatsensitivetocertainparametermodiﬁcations,
most notably thickness. Tests showed a variation of nearly ±3% over the entire wing
structure which may contribute to the observed errors.

The actuator for the active wing is constructed from 0.015 inch nominally thick
PZT material with silver electrode layers. The sensor is made from two layers of
0.003 inch polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) material. These dual sensor layers are
wired in parallel and oriented orthogonal to each other in order to eliminate the
directional bias typically associated with this material.
For control system design, system identiﬁcation was employed to obtain an esti-
mate of the transfer function from actuator to sensor. Since the structural response
of the wing is modiﬁed upon attaching the actuator and sensor, system identiﬁcation
is important to the successful implementation of a compensator. Although analytic
models are critical to understating a physical system and its dynamic behavior, there
is no substitute for an experimentally identiﬁed model of the system when designing
a controller. Factors such as damping, actuator dynamics, and phase effects from
signal conditioning circuitry are often omitted or ignored in analytical models, but
are critical to the accurate prediction of the system response.
Subspace system identiﬁcation techniques, such as the Eigensystem Realization
Algorithm (ERA) [67], and the N4SID algorithm [68], allow for the generation
of state-space models from multivariable input/output data sets generated with a
frequency rich input signal. Order for the identiﬁed model can be prescribed, or

determined by over-ﬁtting the data and choosing a reasonable truncation point by
looked at the Hankel singular values. The later approach was taken for this work.
Wind tunnel testing of the non-active wing demonstrates a ﬂutter boundary of
35 m/s at 19 Hz showing a 10% variation in the observed ﬂutter boundary from the
predicted response of 31.5 m/s at 18.5 Hz. Here, the ﬂutter boundary is considered
to be the point at which clear harmonics appear in the measured frequency response.
The analysis and design presented is restricted to linear modeling techniques. As was
shown in [69], structural non-linearities can lead to limit cycle oscillations (LCOs)
consistent with those observed in this experiment. However, as will be shown, the
LCO can be eliminated and the onset of ﬂutter delayed by designing a compensator
based on a pre-ﬂutter, linear model of the system.
As predicted by the analytical model, the wing response is dominated by the
second mode as the ﬂow speed progresses toward the ﬂutter boundary. Additionally,
a gradual reduction in the frequency of the second mode from a no-ﬂow frequency
of 25 Hz toward a ﬂutter frequency in the vicinity of 18 Hz is also observed and
consistent with the predicted response.
To demonstrate the progression of the mode shape as a function of ﬂow speed,
the second mode was driven harmonically, and the laser vibrometer was used to
measure point-velocities over a grid sufﬁcient for generating a contour plot of the
mode shape. These plots are generated for ﬂow speeds varying from 0 m/s to the pre-
ﬂutter condition of 31 m/s. A comparison of the experimentally determined mode
shape progression with the predicted progression can be seen in Fig. 34. The inferred
nodal regions in the experimental plots demonstrate a tendency in low velocity areas
similar to that found in the analytical model. The experimental results are limited
by noise due to turbulence as well as nonlinearities in the response associated with
LCO that dominates at the onset of ﬂutter.
Given the observed correlation between the experimental and analytical model,
the ﬁnal test involves the design and implementation of a dynamic compensator
using the optimally designed actuator and sensor. The compensator is designed from
an identiﬁed model of the experimental test structure. However, the chosen inputs
and outputs for the design are consistent with that of the analytical model, and the
compensator is designed through H2 synthesis. The controller is implemented on a
digital signal processor and interfaced through analog to digital and digital to analog
converters with the hardware.
Experimental results from the closed-loop response are presented in Fig. 35. The
ﬂutter boundary is increased from 33.5 m/s to 37.8 m/s – a 13% increase. The
magnitude of both the open-loop frequency response (measured at 33.5 m/s) and
the closed-loop frequency response (measured at 37.5 m/s) from the actuator to the
measured velocity at the tip of the wing is illustrated in Fig. 35. The harmonics used
to deﬁne the onset of ﬂutter are clearly observed as evidenced by the dramatic spikes
in frequency intervals of approximately 18 Hz in the open-loop response. The lack
of harmonics in the closed-loop response, in addition to the substantial reduction in
magnitude of the second mode, shows signiﬁcant control effect.

Closing Comments on Aeroelastic Control
Within this chapter, we have presented a uniﬁed approach to aeroelastic system
modeling and control based upon linear analysis tools. These models capture the
basic physics (structural, aerodynamic, or aeroelastic) and are often suitable for
designpurposes,eveninsystemswherenonlinearconsiderationsarerequiredforﬁnal
veriﬁcation analysis. Model reduction was shown to enable signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation,
without a critical loss of accuracy, by focusing on physically relevant input/output
paths and a bandwidth of interest. Such model reduction was shown to be not only
useful in the design of compensators, but also in the physical design of systems to
determine optimal actuator and sensor placement. These models were also extended
to encompass parameter varying systems, and shown to permit explicit design of
gain scheduled control laws.
Although the models presented within this chapter are relatively simple, the basic
tools used are applicable to more complex aeroelastic systems and afford the same
advantages to designers. The “great divide” in design frequently occurs when the
design of the structure and that of the control system are separated. When properly
integrated, one can effectively design the structure to be controlled, which can greatly
reduce the order of the compensator required to achieve the desired objective and
further improve robustness with respect to performance and stability.
There are a number of frontiers yet to be addressed if we are to transition these
tools to modern day design practice. Reduced-order aerodynamic models which
incorporate the effects of compressibility, viscosity, and/or nonlinearity are critical
to extending the applicability of the approach presented to a wider range of missions
and models. Furthermore, one must also address the impact of model uncertainty in
such systems and develop design philosophies which minimize the effect of uncer-
tainties on closed-loop performance. Finally, although gain scheduling overcomes
some of the pitfalls of single-point control designs, the ﬁnal answer may be in adap-
tive control systems that combine both the identiﬁcation of parameter dependent
models and the design of control laws. Each of these are topics of active research
interest, and exploiting the progress in these areas in the multidisciplinary ﬁeld of
aeroservoelasticity will provide opportunities to improve radically the design and
performance of future aircraft.

Modern Analysis for Complex and
Nonlinear Unsteady Flows in
Turbomachinery
Kenneth Hall
Abstract The ﬁeld of turbomachinery is undergoing major advances in aeroelas-
ticity and this chapter provides an overview of these new developments in the key
enabling methodology of unsteady aerodynamic modeling. Also see the earlier dis-
cussions in chapters “Aeroelasticity in Turbomachines” and “Modeling of Fluid-
Structure Interaction.”
In this chapter, we review the state of the ﬁeld of computational unsteady aerodynam-
ics, particularly frequency domain methods used for the calculation of the unsteady
aerodynamic forces arising in turbomachinery aeroelasticity problems 1. While the
emphasis here is on turbomachinery aerodynamics, the methods described in this
chapter have analogues for the analysis of isolated airfoils, wings, and even whole
aircraft, as well as rotorcraft.
The two main aeromechanics problems in turbomachinery are ﬂutter and gust
response. In the ﬂutter problem, the unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on a cascade
of turbomachinery airfoils arise from the motion of the airfoils themselves. In the
gust response problem, the original excitation arises away from the blade row in
question. Typical sources of excitation are wakes or potential ﬁelds from neighboring
blade rows or support structures (struts), inlet distortions, and hot streaks from the
combustor.
More recently, a third class of aeromechanical problems has been identiﬁed [1].
This class of problems is akin to galloping of power lines or buffeting of aircraft
wings. Examples include so-called separated ﬂow vibrations and non-synchronous
vibrations. In separated ﬂow vibrations, the ﬂow over a row of airfoils is separated, or
nearly so. The ﬂow itself is unstable, producing unsteady air loads with broadband
frequency distributions that excite the airfoil at all frequencies producing a large
response at the natural structural frequencies of the airfoil. Non-synchronous ﬂow

vibrations, on the other hand, are similar to separated ﬂow vibrations in that the
source of the excitation is thought to be a ﬂuid dynamics instability (rather than an
aeroelastic instability), except that non-synchronous vibrations can also occur well
away from a stalled condition and the response tends to be at a single frequency.
If this ﬂuid dynamic natural frequency happens to be close to a structural natural
frequency, then the ﬂuid dynamic instability frequency can “lock on” to the structural
frequency of the airfoils resulting in a large-amplitude vibration.
Most unsteady ﬂows of interest in turbomachinery aeromechanics are periodic
in time, and for many of these ﬂows, the unsteadiness in the ﬂow is also relatively
small compared to the mean steady ﬂow. Thus, the ﬂow may be decomposed into two
parts: a nonlinear steady or mean ﬂow, plus a dynamically linear small perturbation
unsteady ﬂow. In general, the steady ﬂow is described by a set of nonlinear partial
differential equation, whereas the unsteady small-perturbation ﬂow is described by
a set of linear variable coefﬁcient partial differential equations that are hyperbolic in
time. Because the unsteady perturbation ﬂow is periodic in time, we may, without loss
of generality, represent the unsteady ﬂow as a Fourier series in time with coefﬁcients
that vary spatially. Each Fourier coefﬁcient is described by a set of partial differential
equations in which time does not appear explicitly. Such equations are called “time-
linearized” equations, and their solution is one of the main topics of this chapter.
Working in the frequency domain rather than the time domain has a number of
distinct advantages. The available frequency solution techniques tend to be much
more computationally efﬁcient than the equivalent time domain techniques. Addi-
tionally, certain parts of the unsteady ﬂow problem—for instance, the description
of the behavior of acoustic, vortical, and entropic waves—are simpliﬁed in the fre-
quency domain.
Inthecasewheretheunsteadinessintheﬂowislarge,thetime-linearizedequations
are not valid. Fortunately, however, the unsteady ﬂow may still be calculated in the
frequency domain using a recently developed harmonic balance technique.
Finally, although the emphasis in this chapter is on unsteady aerodynamics asso-
ciated with aeromechanical problems, frequency domain techniques can be used to
solve of wide variety of problems, including performance, unsteady heat transfer,
aeroacoustic, and ﬂow stability problems.

Linearized Analysis of Unsteady Flows
Recently, a number of investigators have developed linearized Euler and Navier–
Stokes solvers to predict unsteady ﬂows in turbomachinery. To motivate these meth-
ods, consider the two-dimensional Euler equations, given by
∂ˆU
∂t + ∂ˆF
∂x + ∂ˆG
∂y = 0
(1.1)

Modern Analysis for Complex and Nonlinear …
593
where ˆU is the vector of conservation variables, and ˆF and ˆG are so-called ﬂux
vectors. These are given by
ˆU =
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
ˆρ
ˆρˆu
ˆρˆv
ˆe
⎤
⎥⎥⎦,
ˆF =
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
ˆρˆu
ˆρˆu2 + ˆp
ˆρˆu ˆv
ˆρˆu ˆh0
⎤
⎥⎥⎦,
ˆG =
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
ˆρˆv
ˆρˆu ˆv
ˆρˆv2 + ˆp
ˆρˆv ˆh0
⎤
⎥⎥⎦
(1.2)
where ˆρ is the density, ˆu and ˆv are the x and y components of velocity, ˆp is the static
pressure, ˆe is the total internal energy, and ˆh0 is the total enthalpy. The pressure,
energy, and total enthalpy can in turn be expressed in terms of the conservation
variables.
The ﬂow is assumed to be composed of a mean ﬂow plus an unsteady perturbation
ﬂow that is harmonic in time, so that
ˆU(x, y, t) = U(x, y) + u(x, y)e jωt
(1.3)
wheretheperturbationamplitudeu(x, y)issmallcomparedtothemeanﬂowU(x, y),
and ω is the frequency of the unsteadiness. This assumption is substituted into the
Euler equations, Eq.(1.1), and the result is expressed as a perturbation series in the
smallparameter.Thecollectedzeroth-ordertermsresultinthesteadyEulerequations,
which are solved using now conventional computational ﬂuid dynamic techniques.
The collected ﬁrst-order terms give the linearized Euler equations, i.e.,
jωu + ∂
∂x
 ∂F
∂Uu
	
+ ∂
∂y
∂G
∂U u

(1.4)
where ∂F/∂U and ∂G/∂U are steady ﬂow Jacobians. These equations are solved
subject to appropriate “upwash” boundary conditions at the airfoil surface, far-ﬁeld
boundary conditions, and periodicity conditions that allow the computational domain
to be reduced to a single blade passage.
One of the earliest linearized Euler solvers was developed by Ni and Sisto [2]. So
that they could make use of more traditional time marching CFD algorithms, Ni and
Sisto introduced a pseudo-time term τ into the linearized Euler equations, i.e.,
∂u
∂τ + jωu + ∂
∂x
 ∂F
∂Uu
	
+ ∂
∂y
∂G
∂U u
	
= 0
(1.5)
where now u = u(x, y, τ). This additional term makes the equations hyperbolic
in pseudo time, and hence they may be marched in pseudo time using traditional
CFD techniques. As time advances, the solution reaches a steady state and the addi-
tional term goes to zero. Thus the solution to the original linearized Euler equations
[Eq.(1.4)] is obtained. The results of this early analysis, however, were limited to
ﬂat plate cascades with homentropic ﬂows.

594
K. Hall
Hall and Crawley [3] discretized the linearized Euler equations using a ﬁnite
volume scheme, and assembled the resulting equations into a large sparse set of
matrix equations which were then solved using LU decomposition. Shock ﬁtting
and shock capturing were used to explicitly model the motion of wakes and shocks.
However, due to the complexity of the shock ﬁtting algorithm, only a few model
transonic ﬂows problems were computed. Nevertheless, this work demonstrated the
feasibility of using the linearized Euler equations to model transonic ﬂows, at least
for cases where the motion of the shock is not too large.
In recent years, a number of investigators [4–8] have continued to develop the
linearized Euler technique using pseudo time marching.
The time-linearized technique has been extended to three-dimensional inviscid
(Euler) ﬂows [9, 10] and to two and three-dimensional viscous (Navier–Stokes)
ﬂows [11–13] in turbomachinery.
The time-linearized frequency-domain approach has a number of distinct advan-
tages over a conventional time-domain approach. By using pseudo time marching,
conventional steady CFD techniques may be used to solve the time-linearized equa-
tions. Thus, acceleration techniques such as local time stepping and multiple grid
acceleration techniques may be used to accelerate convergence. Furthermore, by
using complex periodicity conditions, the computational domain can be reduced to
a single blade passage. The result is that time-linearized solutions can be obtained in
computational times comparable to the time required to obtain a steady ﬂow solution.
One feature of most linearized Euler and Navier–Stokes solvers is the use of
harmonically deforming computational meshes [7]. The use of the deforming grid
eliminates the need for a troublesome extrapolation term appearing in the upwash
boundary condition applied at the airfoil surface, but also produces an inhomoge-
neous term in the linearized Euler equation, Eq.(1.4), that depends on the mean ﬂow
and the prescribed grid motion.
One important aspect of a linearized Euler analysis is how shocks are treated. Two
approaches have been used. Hall and Crawley [3] used shock ﬁtting to model shocks
within a linearized framework. Shock ﬁtting, while providing explicit descriptions
of the shock motion, is somewhat difﬁcult to implement for general cascade ﬂows
which may have rather complicated shock features. For this reason, shock capturing is
favored. However, until recently it was not known whether shock capturing correctly
predicts the unsteady aerodynamic loads induced by the unsteady shock motion.
The situation is shown graphically in Fig.1. Shown are the mean and unsteady
shock trajectories on the surface of an airfoil or channel. Also shown are typical
unsteady ﬂow quantities, e.g., pressure. In a linearized analysis, the motion of the
shock appears as an impulse in pressure. At this impulse, the pressure is not small
(in fact it is of the same order as the mean ﬂow pressure), and therefore, one might
conclude that the linearization would break down at this point. Lindquist and Giles
[14] argued that to obtain the proper shock impulse, one must faithfully linearize a
conservative discretization of the Euler equations. Hall et al. [8] demonstrated that
the correct shock impulse is produced if a conservative discretization of the Euler
equations is used, and further, that the shock is smoothed so that it is smeared over
several grid points.

of the shock impulse differ between the two solutions, the integrated force is very
nearly equal. The integrated unsteady lift differs by just 2%.
The time-linearized approach can also be applied equally well viscous ﬂows using
the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations and/or three-dimensional ﬂows. As
an example, consider the case of the front stage of a modern front stage transonic
compressor rotor shown in Fig.4. Shown are the blades of the rotor together with
the computed streamlines associated with the steady ﬂow at a particular operating
condition. These results were computed using a steady Navier–Stokes ﬂow solver
that uses the Spalart–Allmaras [18] turbulence model to predict turbulent viscosity.
Note the clearly visible tip vortex due to leakage ﬂow through the tip clearance.
Next, the rotor blades are assumed to vibrate in their ﬁrst bending mode (and
at the natural frequency of that mode) with zero interblade phase angle. Figure5
shows the computed steady and unsteady pressure distributions for this compressor
rotor near the midspan of the blade computed using the time-linearized technique.

Analysis of Unsteady Flows in Multistage Machines
2Unsteady ﬂuid motion is essential to gas turbine engine operation. Only through
unsteadyﬂowprocessescanamachinedoworkonaﬂuidtoincreaseitstotalenthalpy.
This unsteadiness is provided in compressors and turbines by relative motion of
adjacent stators and rotors. Unfortunately, this motion also produces undesirable
aeroacoustic and aeroelastic phenomena, i.e., tonal noise and forced blade vibrations
induced by rotor/stator interactions. Furthermore, the aeroelastic (ﬂutter) stability of
a rotor can be profoundly inﬂuenced by the presence of nearby stators and rotors.
Most current unsteady aerodynamic theories model a single blade row in an
inﬁnitely long duct, ignoring potentially important multistage effects. However,
unsteady ﬂows are made up of acoustic, vortical, and entropic waves. These waves
provide a mechanism for the rotors and stators of multistage machines to commu-
nicate with one another. For example, consider the case of a row of vibrating rotor
blades (see Fig.6).
The blades will respond aerodynamically, producing acoustic, vortical, and
entropic waves which propagate away from the rotor. Some of these waves will then
impinge on the neighboring stators. The stators will in turn respond aerodynami-
cally, again producing waves, some of which will impinge upon the original rotor,
and so on. In other words, wave behavior makes unsteady ﬂow in turbomachinery
fundamentally a multistage phenomenon.
The basic time-linearized Euler and Navier–Stokes approach can be extended to
the case of multistage ﬂows [19]. For a given multistage fan or compressor, one ﬁrst
generates a computational mesh for each blade row. Unlike time-domain multistage

analyses, the computational mesh for each blade row need only include a single
passage.
Having generated a computational mesh, the steady ﬂow is computed using
the steady Euler or Navier–Stokes equations and conventional computational ﬂuid
dynamic (CFD) techniques, with so-called “mixing planes” (the inter-row compu-
tational boundaries of the computational grid) used to couple together the solutions
computed in the individual blade rows. The solution in each blade row is computed
independently, except that at each time step in the pseudo time marching, the ﬂow at
the inter-row computational boundaries between two blades rows is updated so that
the circumferentially averaged ﬂow at the inlet (or exit) of one blade row is matched
the circumferentially averaged ﬂow at the exit (or inlet) of the neighboring blade
row.
For the unsteady ﬂow solution, the process is similar. However, instead of a single
solution in each passage, several linearized unsteady ﬂow calculations are performed
simultaneously in each blade row, one corresponding to each spinning mode retained
in the model. Each spinning mode is identiﬁed by a set of integers that describe the
scattering process that creates the mode (n and k in Fig.6). These integers, along
with the frequency and interblade phase angle of the initial disturbance and the blade
counts in each blade row, determine the interblade phase angle and frequency of
the mode. The only coupling among the various spinning modes is at the inter-row
boundaries.
The advantages of this approach are several. First, unlike time-domain techniques
where many blade passages are required to model each blade row, only a single
passage is required for each row. Second, as in the single blade row computations,
a pseudo time marching technique is used to march the solution to steady state, and
acceleration techniques such as multigrid may be used. Finally, as a practical matter,
only a handful of spinning modes are usually needed to obtain accurate solutions.
These three factors mean that memory requirements and computational time required
to compute the unsteady multistage solution are greatly reduced compared to time
domain solvers. A typical unsteady multistage ﬂow calculation might take on the
order of just ten times the computational time required for a single steady blade row
ﬂow computation.
As an example, consider the case of the front stage of a modern compressor.
This three-dimensional conﬁguration consists of three blade rows (IGV/rotor/stator).
Figure7 shows the static pressure distribution near the midspan location computed
using a steady Euler multistage ﬂow solver. Note, that the contours at the inter-row
boundaries are not continuous since only the circumferential averages of the ﬂows
in each blade row match at the boundaries.
Next, the middle blade row (rotor) is assumed to vibrate in its ﬁrst bending mode
and frequency. Figure8 shows the real and the imaginary parts of the unsteady pres-
sure on the rotor row for an interblade phase angle of −30. deg. The multistage
solution was computed using one and eight spinning modes in the coupling proce-
dure. One can see that there is signiﬁcant difference between the isolated and coupled
(multistage) computations.

The unsteady pressure distribution can be integrated to obtain the unsteady modal
force acting on the rotor blades due to their vibration. Figure9 shows the real and
imaginary parts of the computed generalized forces on the rotor blades as a func-
tion of interblade phase angle. Note the signiﬁcant difference between the forces
computed using a single blade row (the rotor) and three blade rows (the rotor and
the upstream IGV and downstream stator). Clearly, multistage effects are important.
However, the generalized force computed using just one spinning mode is in very
good agreement with the force computed using eight spinning modes, indicating the
dominant coupling is in the fundamental mode.
These results, and earlier two-dimensional results produced by Hall and Silkowski
[20–22], conﬁrm that the aerodynamic damping of a blade row that is part of a mul-
tistage machine can be signiﬁcantly different than that predicted using an isolated
blade row model. This is an important result since most unsteady aerodynamic theo-
ries currently used in industry assume that the blade row can be modeled as isolated
in an inﬁnitely long duct. However, a good estimate of the aerodynamic damping
can be obtained using just a few spinning modes in the model. In fact, most of
the unsteady aerodynamic coupling between blade rows occurs in the fundamental
spinning mode, that is, the spinning mode associated with the original disturbance.
Scattered modes are relatively less important.
Although not shown here, Hall and Silkowski [20–22] have shown that the two
neighboring stator blade rows adjacent to a rotor have the strongest inﬂuence on the
unsteady aerodynamic response of the rotor. The next nearest blade rows are less
important, but can have a modest inﬂuence. As a practical matter, this means that
only three blade rows need to be included in most unsteady ﬂow computations.
Finally, we note that while the frequency domain multistage analysis presented
here is for small disturbance (linearized) ﬂows, the method has been extended to

The Harmonic Balance Method for Nonlinear Unsteady
Aerodynamics
A number of investigators have developed frequency domain analyses of nonlinear
unsteady ﬂows [25–33]. While the methods differ somewhat in detail, most can be
viewed as a form of harmonic balance. To motivate the development of the harmonic
balance analysis, and for simplicity, we assume for the moment that the ﬂow in a blade
row is two-dimensional, inviscid, and non-heat-conducting, with constant speciﬁc

heats. Thus, the ﬂow may be modeled by the two-dimensional Euler equations,
Eq.(1.1).
In this section, we consider unsteady ﬂows that are temporally and spatially peri-
odic. In particular, temporal periodicity requires that
U(x, y, t) = U(x, y, t + T )
(3.1)
where T is the temporal period of the unsteadiness. Similarly, for cascade ﬂow
problems arising from vibration of the airfoils with ﬁxed interblade phase angles σ,
or incident gusts that are spatially periodic, spatial periodicity requires that
U(x, y + G, t) = U(x, y, t + T )
(3.2)
where G is the blade-to-blade gap, and T is the time lag associated with the
interblade phase lag. As an example, consider a cascade of airfoils where the source
of aerodynamic excitation is blade vibration with a prescribed interblade phase angle
σ and frequency ω. Then T = 2π/ω and T = σ/ω.
Because the ﬂow is temporally periodic, the ﬂow variables may be represented as
a Fourier series in time with spatially varying coefﬁcients. For example, the conser-
vation variables may be expressed as
ρ(x, y, t) =

n

(3.3)
where in principle the summations are taken over all integer values of n. In practice,
these series are truncated to a ﬁnite number of terms, −N ≤n ≤+N.
Next, at least conceptually, we substitute the series expansions for ρ, ρu, ρv, and
ρe into the Euler equations, Eq.(1.1). The result is expanded in a Fourier series,
with terms grouped by frequency. Using a traditional harmonic balance approach,
each frequency component must vanish. Collecting the resulting harmonic balance
equations together into one vector equation gives

The vectors ˜F and ˜G are much more complicated, but can be written as a nonlinear
functions of the vector of Fourier coefﬁcients of the conservation variables ˜U.
Finally, we note the conservation variables are real quantities, so that
U−n = U n
(3.6)
where U n is the complex conjugate of Un. Thus, we only need to store Fourier
coefﬁcients for non-negative n. If N harmonics are retained in the Fourier series
representation of the ﬂow, then 2N + 1 coefﬁcients are stored for each ﬂow variable
(one for the zeroth harmonic or mean ﬂow, and 2N for the real and imaginary parts
of the remaining harmonics).
Computation of the harmonic ﬂuxes is difﬁcult and computationally expensive;
on the order of N 3 operations are required, so that the cost of the harmonic bal-
ance analysis grows rapidly with the number of harmonics. Also, this approach is
not readily applicable to viscous ﬂows, because turbulence models tend to be quite
complex, and not readily expressed in simple algebraic forms.

To alleviate these problems, we note that alternatively, one can reconstruct the
Fourier coefﬁcients of the conservation variables ˜U and the ﬂux vectors ˜F and ˜G
from a knowledge of the temporal behavior of U, F, and G at 2N + 1 equally spaced
points over one temporal period. In other words,
˜U = EU∗
(3.7)
where U∗is the vector of conservation variables at 2N + 1 equally spaced points in
time over one temporal period, and E is matrix that is the discrete Fourier transform
operator. Conversely,
U∗= E−1 ˜U
(3.8)
where E−1 is the corresponding inverse Fourier transform operator. Similar expres-
sions hold for the ﬂux vectors.
Substitution of Eq.(3.7) into Eq.(3.3) gives
∂EF∗
∂x
+ ∂EG∗
∂y
+ jωNEU∗= 0
(3.9)
where N is a diagonal matrix with n in the entries corresponding to the nth harmonic.
Pre-multiplying Eq.(3.9) by E−1 gives
∂F∗
∂x + ∂G∗
∂y + S∗= 0
(3.10)
where
S∗= jωE−1NEU∗≈∂U∗
∂t
(3.11)
The product jωE−1NE is just the spectral operator that approximates ∂/∂t. The
advantage of Eq.(3.10) over the original form of the harmonic balance equations,
Eq.(3.4), is that the ﬂuxes in Eq.(3.10) are much easier to compute. The ﬂuxes are
simply computed at each of the 2N + 1 time levels in the usual way, using Eq.(1.2).
Also, the alternate form of the harmonic balance equations can easily be applied
to more complex ﬂow equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, whereas the
original form, Eq.(3.4), cannot.
To solve the harmonic balance equations, we introduce a “pseudo-time” term so
that the equations may be marched to a steady state condition using a conventional
computational ﬂuid dynamic scheme. Using the harmonic balance form of the Euler
equations as an example, we let
∂U∗
∂τ + ∂F∗
∂x + ∂G∗
∂y + S∗= 0
(3.12)

K. Hall
where τ is a ﬁctitious time, used only to march Eq.(3.12) to steady state, driving
the pseudo time term to zero. Note that pseudo-time harmonic balance equations,
Eq.(3.12),aresimilarinformtotheoriginaltime-domainformoftheEulerequations,
Eq.(3.7). However, the conservation variable vector, U∗and ﬂux vectors F∗and
G∗are now 2N + 1 larger than the original vectors U, F, and G. Furthermore, the
physical time derivative term is replaced by the time spectral term S∗, and the pseudo
time term is added.
The time spectral term S∗requires O(N 2) operations to compute (or O(N log(N))
if an FFT is used). However, the calculation of the ﬂux vector terms is greatly simpli-
ﬁed, requiring only O(N) computations. As a practical matter, the ﬂux calculations,
and other calculations requiring O(N) computations, require much more computa-
tional time than the relatively simple time derivative term. Thus, the computational
time scales like the number of Fourier terms retained in the solution, at least for
modest sized N.
Although the harmonic balance technique has been described using the Euler
equations, the method can be readily applied to the Reynolds averaged Navier–
Stokes equations. As an example, we apply the harmonic balance technique to a
representative ﬂutter problem. We consider a two-dimensional section near the tip
of the front stage transonic rotor of a modern high pressure compressor.
At this spanwise station, the inﬂow Mach number M is 1.27, the inﬂow angle
, measured from the axial direction, is 59.3◦, and the Reynolds number Re is
about 1.35×106. The computational grid used is an H-O-H grid, which has good
resolution near the airfoil surface for resolving viscous boundary layers, as well as
good resolution in the far ﬁeld for modeling outgoing waves.
Shown in Fig.10 is the steady ﬂow (i.e., no unsteady disturbances) in the blade
row computed using a grid with 193×33 nodes in the O-grid section. Note the
fairly complex shock structure, with a shock extending from the leading edge both
above and below the airfoil. This shock impinges on the suction surface of the airfoil,
causing a local strong adverse pressure gradient, which causes the boundary layer to
separate. The rapid growth of the boundary layer results in an oblique shock forming
just upstream of the separation point. Also, the ﬂow accelerates over the front portion
of the pressure surface resulting in a weak normal shock at about 40% of the chord
on the pressure surface.
Next, we consider the unsteady aerodynamic response of the rotor for the case
where the airfoils vibrate harmonically in pitch about their midchords with a reduced
frequency ω equal to 1.0 (based on chord and upstream velocity), an interblade
phase angle σ equal to 30◦, and amplitude α. Shown in Fig.11 is the mean pressure
distribution (the zeroth Fourier component) computed for a pitching amplitude α =
1.0◦. The harmonic balance solution was computed using one, three, ﬁve, and seven
harmonics (N = 1, 3, 5, and 7). Note that the mean pressure distributions computed
with various numbers of harmonics are different. However, the solutions converge
rapidly as the number of harmonics is increased.
Next, we consider the ﬁrst harmonic of the unsteady pressure distribution on the
airfoil surface. This component is important, because it is the only component that
contributes to aerodynamic damping for harmonic pitching motion of the airfoil.

Shown in Fig.12 is the ﬁrst harmonic of the unsteady pressure on the airfoil surface,
scaled by the amplitude of the pitching amplitude. As in the case of the mean ﬂow,
the unsteady pressure distributions computed with various numbers of harmonics
are different, but again the solutions converge rapidly as the number of harmonics is
increased.
To demonstrate the inﬂuence of nonlinearities on the unsteady ﬂow, we again
plot the zeroth and ﬁrst harmonics of the unsteady ﬂow in Fig.13. In these results,
the larger amplitude motion solutions are computed using ﬁve harmonics so that the
results are converged in the harmonic balance sense. The pressure distributions are
plotted for several pitching amplitudes. The pressure distributions associated with
the larger amplitude pitching motion is seen to be substantially different from the
small amplitude case. In the small-amplitude case, the mean pressure distribution
shows signs of very sharp shocks. For the larger amplitude motion, the shocks get
“smeared” out. Physically, this is because the shocks oscillate, and when temporally
averaged, the shocks appear smeared. Of course, when viewed at any instant in time,
the shocks are sharp. Also shown are the real and imaginary parts of the ﬁrst harmonic
of the unsteady pressure. In the small-amplitude case, very large and narrow peaks
of pressure are seen. These are the so-called “shock impulses” associated with the
unsteady motion of the shock. As the amplitude of the pitching vibration is increased,
these peaks are reduced and spread out, because the shock motion is larger and the
resulting shock impulse is spread over a larger chordwise extent.
By appropriate integration of the ﬁrst harmonic of the unsteady pressure distri-
bution, one can obtain the ﬁrst harmonic of the pitching moment. The imaginary
part determines the aeroelastic stability of the rotor. In the absence of mechanical
damping, the rotor is stable only if the imaginary moment is less than zero for all
interblade phase angles. Shown in Fig.14 is the pitching moment as a function of
interblade phase angle for several pitching amplitudes. For small amplitude motions,
the rotor is unstable for interblade phase angles σ between −10◦and +60◦. Thus, the

amplitude of an initially inﬁnitesimal motion will grow. As the motion grows, how-
ever, the aerodynamic damping of the least stable interblade phase angle goes to zero.
This is seen more clearly in Fig.15. Shown is the pitching moment for σ = +30◦as
a function of pitch amplitude computed using one, three, ﬁve and seven harmonics.
Clearly, the solution computed with just one harmonic is not converged (except at
very small amplitudes), and gives erroneous results. However, with three or ﬁve har-
monics, the solution is converged to engineering accuracy. Note that the imaginary
moment is positive (unstable) for small amplitude motions, but goes to zero at a
pitching amplitude of about 0.7◦. Thus, the blade will vibrate in a stable limit cycle
with with this pitch amplitude. It is also remarkable that the nonlinear ﬂuid dynamics
effects are important at such a small geometric displacement.

We next consider the computational efﬁciency of the present method. Shown
in Fig.16 are the convergence histories for the steady ﬂow and harmonic balance
calculations. Note that except for N = 7, the steady ﬂow solver and harmonic balance
ﬂow solver converge in about the same number of iterations. For the N = 7 case,
the harmonic balance solution does not converge. Fortunately, we have found that
three to ﬁve harmonics are more than adequate to obtain mode converged solutions
of the zeroth and ﬁrst harmonic components of the unsteady ﬂow, and the harmonic
balance solver usually converges for this number of harmonics.
Finally, the CPU time per iteration of the harmonic balance ﬂow solver for one,
three, ﬁve, and seven harmonics was found to be 2.15, 4.62, 7.45, and 10.29 times

the cost per iteration of the steady ﬂow solver. Even using seven harmonics, the cost
to compute the fully nonlinear, viscous, transonic ﬂow about a vibrating blade row
is only about ten times the cost of a comparable steady ﬂow calculation.
The instability found in the example shown in Fig.16 merits further discus-
sion. The computational scheme used to compute the solution in this case used
an explicit Lax–Wendroff scheme. For a conventional time-marching analysis, the
Lax–Wendroff scheme is stable for CFL numbers less than some ﬁnite number. In
one-dimensional inviscid problems, for example, the CFL number on a cartesian grid
is deﬁnes as

where |umax| is the largest characteristic speed of the ﬂow. For a conventional
time-domain analysis, one ﬁnds that the Lax–Wendroff scheme is stable so long as
C ≤1. For CFL numbers greater than unity, the unstable modes are short wavelength
“sawtooth” modes.
For the harmonic balance analysis, however, the source term S∗in Eq.(3.12)
renders the Lax–Wendroff scheme unconditionally unstable on very large grids, and
conditionally stable on grids of ﬁnite extent. A Fourier stability analysis (which is

valid on large grids) shows that the unstable modes for the harmonic balance method
are long wavelength modes, and the boundary conditions help stabilize the scheme.
In general, the stability computational schemes applied to the harmonic balance
equations depends on two non-dimensional numbers, the CFL number and the grid
reduced frequency, deﬁned by

 is the smallest characteristic speed. Large values of ω tend to make
explicit schemes unstable, even with the stabilizing inﬂuence of boundary condi-
tions, which explains the non-convergence seen in Fig.16 for the N = 7 case. More
recently, a number of researchers have developed implicit schemes to improve the
stability of the method [35–38].

Conclusions
Frequency domain techniques for computing unsteady ﬂows in turbomachinery have
evolved considerably over the past several decades. These techniques are capa-
ble of computing both small-disturbance unsteady ﬂows (using the time-linearized
approach) and large amplitude ﬂows (using the harmonic balance approach). In addi-
tion, the frequency domain approaches have been applied to the difﬁcult but important
problem of computing unsteady ﬂows in multistage machines. In all cases, the fre-
quency domain solvers have a number of distinct advantages over their time-domain
equivalents. Using complex periodicity conditions, the computational domain can be
reduced to a single blade passage (in each row). Furthermore, using the pseudo time
marching technique, the governing Euler and Navier–Stokes equations can be solved
using steady-state acceleration techniques such as local time stepping and multigrid
acceleration. The result is that computing these very complex unsteady ﬂows in
turbomachinery—and other problems involving temporally and spatially periodic
ﬂows—is only modestly more expensive than solving a steady ﬂow problem.

Some Recent Advances in Nonlinear
Aeroelasticity
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract This brings the discussion of nonlinear aeroelasticity up to date. See the
earlier discussion in Chap. 11. Much of the recent advances are based on new under-
standing of such subjects as limit cycle oscillations due to structural non-linearities,
including freeplay, and ﬂuid nonlinearities associated with unsteady separated ﬂow
including self excited ﬂow oscillations variously called buffet or non-synchronous
vibration.
As the reader now knows, aeroelasticity is the ﬁeld that examines, models and seeks
to understand the interaction of the forces from an aerodynamic ﬂow and the defor-
mation of an elastic structure. The forces produce deformation, but the structural
deformation in turn changes the aerodynamic forces. This feedback between force
and deformation leads to a variety of dynamic responses of the ﬂuid and the structure

Introduction
Some twenty plus years ago I had the pleasure of giving the SDM lecture in Mobile,
Alabama and am happy to have the opportunity to do so again here in Orlando.
When asked to give this SDM lecture, I mentioned my previous experience and
suggested that being asked to do so again might be considered double jeopardy. But
I was assured that no one would remember my earlier talk! However, I do recall
that twenty years ago a then radical idea was discussed in the lecture, i.e. that one
could use the eigenmodes of an aerodynamic ﬂow to construct a modal model of the
ﬂow much as has been done for many years for structures. Whether that suggestion
inspired anyone other than our group at Duke, I cannot be sure. But in any event,
reduced order modeling of ﬂow ﬁelds and their interaction with structural response
is today a ﬂourishing topic. Indeed reduced order modeling is now pervasive in many
ﬁelds of engineering and science, no doubt having been discovered and rediscovered
many times by many investigators. And the topic has been generalized in at least three
signiﬁcant ways that I will discuss in this lecture. Given the title of this lecture you
will not be surprised that one of the generalizations is to treat the nonlinear as well
as linear dynamics of aeroelastic or ﬂuid-structural systems. Thus the major theme
of this talk is the modeling of nonlinear aeroelastic systems both mathematically and
computationally as well as experimentally.
2
Motivation and Goals
The motives for pursuing research and developing methods that are useful in practice
are many. But to provide a context and rationale for much of the work to be described
in this lecture, perhaps a few words about goals will be helpful.
When my contemporaries and I ﬁrst began the study and practice of aeroelasticity,
and for a number of years thereafter, any difference between theory and experiment of
design and reality was often attributed to nonlinear effects. However, it was generally
understood that trying to model such nonlinear effects was not to be expected or
attempted. Since then many studies of nonlinear effects have been undertaken and
today the subject is treated in review articles [1–4] and indeed in textbooks [5,
6]. An engineer today no longer has the luxury of simply ignoring such effects
and one of my predictions is that some years from now an SDM Lecturer will be
discussing the favorable effects that can be created by a judicious analysis and design
of nonlinearities in aeroelastic systems. Of course there are unfavorable and indeed
potentially catastrophic consequences of nonlinearities in aeroelastic systems as well,
as is also the case when an aeroelastic system is analyzed and designed with linear
models.
The motivation for reduced order modeling is much the same for ﬂuid systems as
for structural systems. In either case, a relative small number of modes is often (but
not always!) sufﬁcient to describe the dynamics of a structural or ﬂuid system. In

the case of a structure an initial mathematical/computational model may consist of
a ﬁnite element representation with several thousand degrees of freedom while for
a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) model there may be millions of degrees of
freedom. If one can use say one hundred modes or less to describe the structure or the
ﬂuid, then clearly there is a great potential for savings in the cost of the computation.
Indeed at any given point in time of the state of the art in computer hardware and
software, there will be computations that are only feasible if one uses a reduced order
model.
But here it is worth noting that another very important advantage of reduced order
models is the greater physical insight they may give to the investigator. While a
dynamical system with one hundred degrees of freedom or less may be still one of
considerable complexity, it pales in complexity compared to a system with thousands
not to mention millions of degrees of freedom. Moreover it is often the case that
the response of the aeroelastic system is governed by an even smaller number of
modes than the structural or ﬂuid system individually. This is because the ﬂuid and
structural modes of greatest interest will be those that match most closely in both the
spatial (wavelength) and temporal (frequency) domains. In the ﬁeld of acoustics this
matching of frequency and wavelength is called “coincidence”. Lest one think this
means that reduced order models may be smaller than in fact they reasonably can
be, it is well to point out two important facts. First, it cannot always be anticipated
which ﬂuid and structural modes will be most important for an aeroelastic system and
thus more modes must be retained than would otherwise be the case (once the most
dominant aeroelastic modes are determined!). Secondly, if one wishes to control or
modify the aeroelastic system, some of the ﬂuid, structural, and/or aeroelastic or
coupled ﬂuid-structural modes that may not have been important before can now
become important. Therefore and again, more modes must be retained as control of
the system is considered.
It is sometimes said that the use of modes is only possible for a linear system.
It is now widely, though not universally, appreciated that modes can be used for
nonlinear systems as well. Having said that, for linear systems the use of eigenmodes
is almost always the preferred choice for constructing a reduced order model. But
for nonlinear systems other choices of modes may be preferred, e.g. the modes that
can be constructed from Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, so called POD modes.
These modes have been used very successfully by Dowell and colleagues at Duke,
Beran and colleagues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and by Farhat
and colleagues at Stanford.
Finally, one can think of modes as a form of generalized Fourier series in the
spatial domain. Therefore it is perhaps not surprising that a Fourier Series in time
can also be very useful if the temporal response is periodic. As was the case for
eigenmodes versus POD modes for the representation of the spatial domain of non-
linear systems, for nonlinear systems a standard Fourier Series or classical Harmonic
Balance method may not be the best choice for describing the temporal response.
The Higher Order Harmonic Balance method developed by Hall and his colleagues
at Duke has proven to be a very effective method and it has now also been adopted
and exploited by Jameson and colleagues at Stanford and Badcock and colleagues

at Liverpool. A related method has also been developed by Beran and colleagues at
AFRL.
The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. In Sect.3. A transonic
panel ﬂutter and the effect of a viscous boundary layer is treated, in Sect.3. B the
structural nonlinearity of freeplay and its effect on ﬂutter and limit cycle oscilla-
tions (LCO) is discussed, in Sect.3. C reduced order modeling is summarized, in
Sect.4 transonic ﬂutter and LCO of lifting surfaces is reviewed and, ﬁnally, in Sect.5
aerodynamic limit cycle oscillations are discussed, e.g. buffet, abrupt wing stall and
non-synchronous vibration. The present discussion is not meant to be exhaustive
of the study of either nonlinear aeroelasticity or the reduced order modeling. For
example, the nonlinear aeroelasticity of very high aspect ratio, ﬂexible wings is not
treated here (for an introduction to that topic, see [2]) or the use of Volterra series
for reduced order modeling (for an introduction to that topic see [4]). Also rotorcraft
and turbomachinery aeroelasticity, morphing aircraft and other important topics are
not treated here, but are nonetheless active areas of research as seen in papers in the
literature. The topics that have been chosen for this chapter are representative of the
active and productive work underway and are those for which the present authors
can claim some personal experience.

Current Examples of Recent Advances
3.1
Transonic and Subsonic Panel Flutter
Although the vast majority of the literature on panel ﬂutter analysis is devoted to high
supersonic/hypersonic ﬂow, many of the ﬂutter incidents in practice have occurred
in the low supersonic/transonic Mach number regime. A recent paper by Hashimoto,
Aoyama and Nakamura [7] provides new insight into the importance of a viscous
ﬂuid boundary layer on the transonic ﬂutter boundary. Previous work by Dowell [8]
had shown this effect as well. But whereas Dowell used what is sometimes called
a shear ﬂow model that dates back to work of Lighthill and others, the more recent
work of Hashimoto et al. uses a modern CFD code that solves the Navier-Stokes
equations within the framework of a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes model. The
shear ﬂow model by contrast uses a mean ﬂow that represents the boundary layer, but
neglects the viscosity in the small perturbation equations of the ﬂuid that arise from
the panel oscillation. The more rigorous ﬂuid model shows improved agreement with
the excellent experiments of Muhlstein, Gaspers and Riddle [9].
Figure 1 is a schematic of the panel and ﬂow geometry. Figure 2 shows the
comparison between theory and experiment where the experimental data have been
extrapolated to zero boundary layer thickness, δ/a = 0, where δ is the boundary
layer thickness and a is the panel length. The theoretical results from Dowell are for
transonic potential ﬂow and those from Hashimoto et al. are for inviscid Euler ﬂow.
The plot is of a non-dimensional dynamic pressure versus Mach number. The good

agreement among all results is encouraging. Turning now to the case for a boundary
layer thickness of δ/a = 0.1, a similar comparison is shown in Fig.3. Note that
the ﬂutter boundary predicted by theory and that determined experimentally has
been very substantially changed from that for δ/a = 0, especially in the lower Mach
number range. The dynamic pressure for ﬂutter at M = 1.1 has been increased by
a factor of 2–3 due to the viscous boundary layer. While the shear ﬂow model used
by Dowell is a substantial improvement over an inviscid analysis that neglects the
boundary layer effect, the RANS ﬂow model of Hashimoto et al. is a notable further
improvement and agrees better with experiment.
Moreover, as Hashimoto et al. note this is an excellent test case for new develop-
ments in CFD methodology for aeroelastic analysis in general and gives considerable
conﬁdence in the basic theory. They have also shown that in this particular case the
results are not sensitive to the empirical turbulence model used in the RANS ﬂow
model.

While subsonic panel ﬂutter is unusual in aerospace applications it has been
known for many years that panel ﬂutter may occur at subsonic conditions under
some circumstances [10]. Most notably if the trailing edge of the panel is free, then
ﬂutter will occur in subsonic ﬂow. But, if the trailing edge, as well as the leading
edge, of the panel is ﬁxed then divergence (a static aeroelastic instability) will occur
rather than ﬂutter. Panel divergence is a form of aeroelastic buckling and, when the
panel is in a buckled state, then oscillations in the ﬂow due for example to engine or
boundary layer noise may cause a buckled panel to “oil can” from one buckled state to
another. This is sometimes referred to as “dynamic buckling” [10]. In experiments as
well as in nonlinear numerical simulations it may be difﬁcult to distinguish between
limit cycle oscillations due to ﬂutter and oil canning due to dynamic buckling.
The classical example of subsonic panel ﬂutter was described in the paper by
Dugundji and colleagues [11] who considered a panel on an elastic foundation that
can lead to a form of traveling wave ﬂutter. Here recent work on subsonic ﬂutter is
emphasized. See [12, 13]. The work of Tang, Yamamoto and Dowell [12] is for a
panel clamped at its leading edge, but free on both side edges and, most importantly,
freeonitstrailingedge.Boththeoreticalandexperimentalworkhasbeendoneandthe
agreement between theory and experiment is very good for the prediction of ﬂutter
ﬂow velocity and frequency. However, in the experiments, hysteresis is observed
that this is not predicted by the theory which includes a nonlinear structural model
and a nonlinear vortex lattice aerodynamic model [12, 13]. Moreover the amplitude
of the limit cycle oscillation (LCO) that is observed in the experiment after the
onset of ﬂutter and indeed at lower ﬂow velocities due to hysteresis is some two
to three times greater than that predicted by the theoretical model. Currently the
most plausible hypothesis for the differences between theory and experiment is that
vortex shedding and ﬂow separation may occur at the large amplitudes of the LCO.
These effects are not included in the vortex lattice aerodynamic model, but would be
included in a viscous ﬂow model based upon the Navier-Stokes equations.
Because the LCO amplitudes are on the order of the panel chord (LCO amplitudes
of panels which are ﬁxed on two opposing edges are typically much smaller and on
the order of the panel thickness [11]), Tang, Paidoussis and Jiang [13] have suggested
such a LCO is a prime candidate for energy harvesting. And they have analyzed this
conﬁguration inter alia using a similar theoretical model and obtained similar results.
Figure 4 shows a stroboscopic picture of the panel in LCO during a wind tunnel
test [12]. Note the amplitude of the LCO relative to the panel chord.
This conﬁguration is also an example of what is sometimes referred to as “ﬂag
ﬂutter”, but here the bending stiffness of the panel is dominant over the ten-
sion/membrane stiffness of the panel where the latter might be induced by gravity
or shear stresses produced by a viscous ﬂow. So this is a rather stiff “ﬂag”. Current
applications to micro airvehicles and coverings for gaps in conventional wing/control
surfaces during landing may give rise to renewed interest in subsonic panel ﬂutter
for panels and/or thin membranes where both the bending stiffness and membrane
stiffness may be important.

3.2
Freeplay Induced Flutter and Limit Cycle Oscillations
Freeplay is a concern with respect to control surface attachments, but it has also been
suggested as a possible source of ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations in wing/store
attachments. The latter is still an open area of investigation, but recent progress for
freeplay in control surfaces offers an opportunity to enhance both analysis and design
methods and may lead to a paradigm shift in design criteria.
Here a brief review of history is provided, the results of recent advances in under-
standing based upon computations and wind tunnel testing are summarized and the
current design criteria and the data on which they are based are reinterpreted in light
of recent advances.
Figure 5 is taken from one of a series of early reports [14] on the effect of freeplay
on control surface ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations (LCO) conducted at the Wright
Air Development Center, the predecessor to the Air Force Research Laboratory. It is
plot of the putative ﬂutter velocity versus the total angular freeplay in an all movable
control surface. The relevant conclusions drawn at that time from these data were
the following.
The test data also show the variation in ﬂutter speed as a function of free-play....
Fig. 5 Flutter velocity versus freeplay

Free-play in all movable controls should be limited to + or −1/64◦unless it can be shown
by means of experimental ﬂutter model data that reasonable deviations from this free-play
limit can be tolerated for the particular all-movable control design being considered.
This limit of + or −1/64◦remains today more than ﬁfty years later as the basic
design criterion to preclude freeplay induced ﬂutter (and limit cycle oscillations).
Recent computational and experimental work [15–18] has shed new light on these
earlier results. It is now understood that in fact, for an unloaded control surface, the
ﬂow velocity at which limit cycle oscillations (LCO) begins is independent of the
degree of freeplay. Note that even in Fig.5 the early tests concluded that the ﬂutter
velocity was independent of the freeplay angle as this angle became large.
However, it is now known that the amplitude of the LCO and the amount of
loading required to preclude LCO is strongly dependent on the degree of freeplay.
In fact the LCO amplitude scales in proportion to the degree of freeplay and the
amount of loading required to suppress ﬂutter/LCO does as well. For example, the
LCO amplitude will be of the order of the degree of freeplay and if the loading is
due to placing the airfoil at an angle of attack, the angle of attack required to totally
eliminate freeplay is about ﬁve times the degree of freeplay. Thus for a freeplay
of 1/64◦the LCO amplitude will be about 1/64◦and an angle of attack of 5/64◦
is sufﬁcient to suppress the LCO altogether. This then likely explains the apparent
variation of the ﬂutter speed with freeplay angle shown in Fig.5 from the earlier tests.
For small freeplay angles, it is likely the LCO amplitude was undetectable and/or
unavoidable small amounts of angle of attack were sufﬁcient to load the wing so that
LCO was suppressed.
More recent investigations by Tang and Dowell [15, 16], Lee et al. [17] and
Schlomach [18] have conﬁrmed the effect of freeplay and loading on LCO. Figures

Fig. 7 Close-Up of freeplay mechanism
6 (full model view) and 7 (close up of the wire beam that moves between two rigid
stops to produce freeplay) show the wind tunnel model from [11–13]. Figure 8
shows the LCO amplitude of the model versus ﬂow velocity for plunge, pitch and
ﬂap (control surface) degrees of freedom of this model as well as the LCO frequency.
Note the computational results are in very good agreement with the wind tunnel test
data. These results are for zero angle of attack and a freeplay angle of 2.12◦. If the
angle of attack is increased to 8◦, as shown in Fig.9 the range of ﬂow velocity for
which LCO exists is much decreased and a further increase in angle of attack to 10◦
suppresses the LCO altogether. Note however that the ﬂow velocity at which the
LCO begins is not much changed by the angle of attack change. Results (not shown)
also show that varying the degree of freeplay simply changes the LCO amplitude in
proportion while the LCO frequency is unchanged [15–17].
Current work is underway to include the effect of a feedback control system in
this model.
The excellent work of Schlomach [18] for the F-35 program has provided inde-
pendent veriﬁcation of the above results and extended them into the high sub-
sonic/transonic ﬂow regime. As expected the quantitative agreement between theory
and experiment is less satisfactory in the transonic regime because of the challeng-
ing environment for modeling the aerodynamic forces. However, even so, the same
scaling laws for the effect of freeplay and loading were also found in this study.

Reduced Order Modeling of Unsteady Aerodynamics
For an expanded discussion and reviews of this topic, see [1–6].
3.3.1
Eigenmodes and POD Modes
The original impetus for such models was the thought that by using the eigenmodes
of a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) model, one might construct a modal model
of the ﬂuid that is the counterpart for the modal model of a structure obtained from
a ﬁnite element model (FEM). [1–6] And this turns out to be possible with some
notable caveats. First of all, ﬁnding the eigenmodes of a CFD model is itself a
formidable task because of the very large number of degrees of freedom in a typical
CFD model. And indeed the use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to ﬁnd
a suitable set of ﬂuid modes proves to be far more practical. However it is worth
noting in passing that using POD modes one may ﬁnd a good approximation to the

pitch angles of α = 8◦and δ = 2.12◦
dominant eigenmodes of a CFD model. Normally however one uses the POD modes
themselves in an aeroelastic analysis. [3]
Also it is worth noting that the ﬂuid modal model is non-self adjoint and thus
the ﬂuid eigenvalues are complex with each ﬂuid mode eigenvalue having both a
frequency and a damping. Thus both the system and its adjoint must be considered
when constructing the orthogonality relations for the complex eigenmodes. And
perhaps most importantly, the eigenmodes and the POD modes can be very sensitive
to small changes in system parameters, most notably there is a sensitivity to Mach
number. Thus when using POD modes it is most convenient to ﬁx the Mach number
and vary the altitude or ﬂow density for example. However Farhat [19–21] and
his colleagues have made very good progress in showing how one may interpolate
POD modes obtained at two different Mach numbers to obtain a good ROM model
at intermediate Mach numbers thereby expanding the range of application of such
ROMs. This interpolation proves to be surprisingly subtle.

630
E. H. Dowell
For a chronological development of this approach including the seminal paper
by Romanowski [22], the reader may consult [22–29]. There is a discussion of the
eigenmode and/or POD mathematical technique in most of these papers and readily
accessible accounts are available in [3–6].
3.3.2
High Dimensional Harmonic Balance
Here the essential idea is that most aeroelastic responses of interest are periodic in
time. As those who have tried to compute the periodic in time limit cycle oscillation
(LCO) using a time marching CFD code have observed, it takes a very long time to
do so while waiting for the transient oscillation to decay in order to reach the steady
state LCO. Indeed at the ﬂutter point in parameter space which is usually the point
at which LCO also begins, the damping in the critical aeroelastic mode is strictly
speaking zero and the transient never decays. But even near the ﬂutter point, the
transients are usually very long.
Thus it is natural to ask can one avoid computing the transient solution and com-
putei the LCO directly. Classical Harmonic Balance has been used successfully in
pursuit of this goal for low dimensional systems, e.g. the Dufﬁng and Van der Pol
oscillators. However for the high dimensional systems of interest using a nonlinear
CFD model, the classical method becomes practically impossible. Thus Hall and
colleagues [3] developed a signiﬁcant extension to the classical Harmonic Balance
method that is particularly useful for high dimensional dynamical systems such as
those arising from CFD models. Other investigators have found this approach useful
as well. See the work of Jameson et al. [30, 31] and Badcock [32].
For a chronological development of this approach including the seminal paper
by Hall, Thomas and Clark [33], see [33–39]. For an accessible account of the
mathematical formulation of the High Dimensional Harmonic Balance method, see
[34, 40]. Beran and Lucia [35] have developed a related approach that has some
interesting alternative ideas.
For systems that are not strictly periodic in time, but have two fundamental periods
or frequencies, the classical and Higher Order Harmonic Balance Methods can also
be useful if a Fourier Series for each period is constructed. If the system is nonlinear
then the coupling between the (as well as within each of the) components of the two
Fourier Series must be taken into account. While a system with only two fundamental
periods may be thought to be rather limited from a mathematical point of view, in
point of fact it includes systems of interest to aeroelasticians, e.g. an aeroelastic
system undergoing a limit cycle oscillation of a certain period or frequency which is
then excited by an external dynamic force such as a gust with its own characteristic
frequency.

3.3.3
Nonlinear Reduced Order Models Based Upon POD Modes and
High Dimensional Harmonic Balance
Thomas, Dowell and Hall [40] have recently combined the advantages of POD modes
and High Dimensional Harmonic Balance to construct nonlinear reduced order mod-
els. In this approach, the solution is expanded in a Taylor Series with respect to CFD
code parameters including variables such as Mach and the amplitude of the structural
motion. If this expansion were done for each of the many ﬂuid variable degrees of
freedom that may number in the millions or more, the computation would quickly
get out of hand. However if one relates the many ﬂow variables through a coordi-
nate transformation to the modal amplitudes of a relatively small number of POD
modes, then the computational model can be made very efﬁcient. The key then is
to be able to differentiate the CFD code and its ﬂow variables with respect to the
POD modal amplitudes and this can be accomplished using adjoint automatic dif-
ferentiation software that is now widely available [40]. In [40] this reduced order
model is constructed in combination with a High Dimensional Harmonic Balance
(HDHB) solver. In principle this POD approach could also be combined with a time
marching solution algorithm, but that would not exploit the considerable advantages
of the HDHB method.
A representative result [40] is shown in Fig.10 where the results of the full CFD
model and the reduced order model (ROM) are compared in a plot of LCO amplitude
versus a reduced (non-dimensional) velocity. Results are shown for both a ﬁrst and
second order ROM. As can be seen the second order ROM is a distinct improvement

over the ﬁrst order ROM. Of course in principal one can go to a third order ROM
etc. However in practice a better strategy is to choose a small number of full order
solutions and expand in a Taylor Series up to say second order about each of them.
Referring to Fig.10, it is seen that the common point on the three curves is the point
about which the Taylor Series has been expanded. By choosing a few more such
points, the several Taylor Series can be blended to produce the entire LCO response
with sufﬁcient accuracy.

Transonic Flutter and LCO of Lifting Surfaces
This section2 begins with a discussion of generic nonlinear aeroelastic behavior of
wings especially as it relates to Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO); then the important
studies that come from ﬂight experience with LCO are noted which have stimulated
much of the other research on the subject. Next a summary is provided of the pri-
mary physical sources of ﬂuid and structural nonlinearities that can lead to nonlinear
aeroelastic response in general and LCO more particularly.
A brief summary of unsteady aerodynamic models, both linear and nonlinear,
is then given before turning to the heart of the section that provides a critique of
the results obtained to date via various methods using as a framework correlations
between theory and experiment.
4.1
Generic Nonlinear Aeroelastic Behavior
There are several basic concepts that will be helpful for the reader to keep in mind
throughout the discussion to follow. The ﬁrst is the distinction between a static non-
linearity and a dynamic one. In the aeroelasticity literature the term “linear system”
may either mean a (mathematical or wind tunnel) model or ﬂight vehicle that is both
statically and dynamically linear in its response or one that is nonlinear in its static
response, but linear in its dynamic response. So we will usually qualify the term
“linear model” further by noting whether the system is dynamically linear or both
statically and dynamically, i.e. wholly linear.
An example of a system which is wholly linear is a structure whose deformation in
response to either static or dynamic forces is (linearly) proportional to those forces.
An aerodynamic ﬂow is wholly linear when the response (say change in pressure)
is (linearly) proportional to changes in downwash or ﬂuid velocities induced by the
shape or motion of a solid body in the ﬂow. This is the domain of classical small
perturbationaerodynamictheoryandleadstoalinearmathematicalmodel(convected
wave equation) for the ﬂuid pressure perturbation or velocity potential. Shock waves
and separated ﬂow are excluded from such ﬂow models that are both statically and

dynamically linear. A wholly linear aeroelastic model is of course one composed of
wholly linear structural and aerodynamic models.
A statically nonlinear, but dynamically linear structure is one where the static
deformations are sufﬁciently large that the static response is no longer proportional
to the static forces and the responses to the static and dynamic forces cannot simply
be added to give meaningful results. Buckled skin panels (buckling is a nonlinear
static equilibrium that arises from a static instability) that dynamically respond to (not
too large) acoustic loads or the prediction of the onset of their dynamic aeroelastic
instability (ﬂutter) are examples where a statically nonlinear, but dynamically linear
model may be useful.
In aerodynamic ﬂows, shock waves and separated ﬂows are themselves the result
of a dynamically nonlinear process. But once formed they may often be treated in
the aeroelastic context as part of a nonlinear static equilibrium state (steady ﬂow).
Then the question of the dynamic stability of the statically nonlinear ﬂuid-structural
(aeroelastic) system may be addressed by a linear dynamic perturbation analysis
about this nonlinear static equilibrium. Sometime such aerodynamic ﬂow models
are call time linearized.
Of course if one wishes to model limit cycle oscillations and the growth of their
amplitude as ﬂow parameters are changed, then either or both the structural and the
aerodynamic model must be treated as dynamically nonlinear. Often a single non-
linear mechanism is primarily responsible for the limit cycle oscillation. However,
one may not know apriori which nonlinearity is dominant unless one has designed a
mathematical model, wind tunnel model or ﬂight vehicle with the chosen nonlinear-
ity. Not the least reason why limit cycle oscillations are more difﬁcult to understand
in ﬂight vehicles (compared to say mathematical models) is that rarely has a nonlin-
earity been chosen and designed into the vehicle. More often one is dealing with an
unanticipated and possibly unwanted nonlinearity. Yet sometimes that nonlinearity
is welcome because without it the limit cycle oscillation would instead be replaced
by catastrophic ﬂutter leading to loss of the ﬂight vehicle.
It must be emphasized that the variety of possible nonlinear aeroelastic responses
is not limited to ’Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO)’ per se. In the context of nonlinear
system theory [41], an LCO is one of the simplest dynamic bifurcations. Other
common possible nonlinear responses includei higher harmonic and subharmonic
resonances, jump-resonances, entrainment, beating and period doubling to name
only a few. These responses have been studied using low order model problems
in the nonlinear dynamics literature; however in aeroelastic wind tunnel and ﬂight
testing the detailed knowledge required to identify these nonlinear responses has
rarely been available.
Now consider the generic types of nonlinear dynamic response that may occur,
i.e. limit cycle oscillations and the variation of their amplitude with ﬂight speed (or
wind tunnel velocity). Of course the frequency of the LCO may vary with ﬂight
parameters as well, but usually the frequency is near that predicted by a classical
linear dynamic stability (ﬂutter) analysis.

tions) below the ﬂutter (instability) boundary predicted by a linear dynamical model.
Beyond the ﬂutter boundary, LCO arise due to some nonlinear effect and typically
the amplitude of the LCO increases as the ﬂight speed increases beyond the ﬂutter
speed. In Fig.11b, the other generic possibility is shown. While again LCO exist

beyond the ﬂutter boundary, now LCO may also exist below the ﬂutter boundary,
if the disturbances to the system are sufﬁciently large. Moreover both stable (solid
line) and unstable (dotted line) LCO now are present. Stable LCO exist when for
any sufﬁciently small disturbance, the motion returns to the same LCO at large time.
Unstable LCO are those for which any small perturbation will cause the motion to
move away from the unstable LCO and move toward a stable LCO. Theoretically, in
the absence of any disturbance both stable and unstable LCO are possible dynamic,
steady state motions of the system. Information about the size of the disturbance
required to move from one stable LCO to another can also be obtained from data
such as shown in Fig.11b. Note also the hysteretic response as ﬂight speed increases
and then decreases.
4.2
Flight Experience with Nonlinear Aeroelastic Effects
Much of the ﬂight experience with aircraft LCO has been documented by the Air
Force SEEK EAGLE Ofﬁce at Eglin AFB and is described in several publications
by Denegri and his colleagues [42–45]. Most of this work has been in the context of
the F-16 aircraft. Denegri distinguishes among three types of LCO based upon the
phenomenological observations in ﬂight and as informed by classical linear ﬂutter
analysis. “Typical LCO” is when the LCO begins at a certain ﬂight condition and then
with say an increase in Mach number at constant altitude the LCO response smoothly
increases. “Flutter”, as distinct from LCO, is said to occur when the increase in LCO
amplitude with change in Mach number is so rapid that the safety of the vehicle is in
question.i And ﬁnally “atypical LCO” is said to occur when the LCO amplitude ﬁrst
increases and then decreases and perhaps disappears with changes in Mach number.
This is also sometimes called a “hump” mode. Often changes in ﬂight vehicle angle
of attack lead to similar generic LCO responses to those observed with changes in
Mach number.
It has long been recognized [46] that the addition of external stores to aircraft
changes the dynamic characteristics and may adversely affect ﬂutter boundaries.
Limit cycle oscillations (LCO) remain a persistent problem on high performance
ﬁghter aircraft with multiple store conﬁgurations. Using measurements obtained
from ﬂight tests, Bunton and Denegri [47] describe LCO characteristics of the F-16
and F/A-18 aircraft. While LCO can be present in any sort of nonlinear system, in
the context of aeroelasticity, LCO typically is exhibited as an oscillatory response
of the wing, the amplitude of which is limited, but dependent on the nature of the
nonlinearity as well as ﬂight conditions, such as speed, altitude, and Mach num-
ber. The LCO motion is often dominated by antisymmetric modes. LCO are not
described by standard linear aeroelastic analysis, and they may occur at ﬂight condi-
tions below those at which linear instabilities such as ﬂutter are predicted. Although
the amplitude of the LCO may rise above structural failure limits, more typically the
presence of LCOs results in a reduction in vehicle performance, leads to airframe-
limiting structural fatigue, and compromises the ability of pilots to perform critical

636

mission-related tasks. When LCO are unacceptable, extensive and costly ﬂight tests
for aircraft/store certiﬁcation are required.
Denegri [42, 43] suggests that for the F-16, the frequencies of LCO might be iden-
tiﬁed by linear ﬂutter analysis; however, linear analysis fails to predict the oscillation
amplitude or the onset velocity for LCO. Thus, nonlinear analysis will be necessary
to predict the onset of the LCO and their amplitudes with changing ﬂight conditions.
4.2.1
Nonlinear Aerodynamic Effects
There are several other ﬂight experiences with limit cycle oscillations in addition
to the F-16 including those for example with the F-18, the B-1 and B-2. Most of
these LCO have been attributed by investigators to nonlinear aerodynamic effects
due to shock wave motion and/or separated ﬂow. However, there is the possibility
that nonlinear structural effects involving stiffness, damping or freeplay may play
a role as well. Indeed, much of the present day research and development effort
is devoted to clarifying the basic mechanisms responsible for nonlinear ﬂutter and
LCO. For an authoritative discussion of these issues see Cunningham et al. [48–50],
Denegri [41–45] on the F-16 and F-18, Dobbs [51], Hartwich [52] on the B-1 and
Britt, Jacobsen and Dreim [53] on the B-2. Recent experimental evidence from wind
tunnel tests is beginning to shed further light on these matters as are advances in
mathematical and computational modeling.
4.2.2
Freeplay
There have been any number of aircraft that have experienced ﬂutter induced limit
cycle oscillationsi as a result of control surface freeplay. These are not well doc-
umented in the public literature, but are more known by word of mouth among
practitioners and perhaps documented in internal company reports and/or restricted
government ﬁles.
A recent and notable exception is the account in Aviation Week and Space Tech-
nology by Croft [54] of a ﬂutter/limit cycle oscillation as a result of freeplay. In many
ways this account is typical. The oscillation is of limited amplitude and there was
a reported disagreement between the manufacturer and the regulating governmental
agency as to whether this oscillation was or was not sufﬁciently large as to be a threat
to the structural integrity of the aircraft structure. See also Sect.3 of this paper.
4.2.3
Geometric Structural Nonlinearities
Another not infrequently encountered and documented case is the limit cycle oscil-
lation that follows the onset of ﬂutter in plate-like structures. The structure has a
nonlinear stiffening as a result of the tension induced by mid-plane stretching of
the plate that arises from its lateral bending. This is most commonly encountered in

Some Recent Advances in Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
637
what is often called panel ﬂutter where a local element of a wing or fuselage skin
encounters ﬂutter and then a limit cycle oscillation.i There have been many incidents
reported in the literature dating back to the V-2 rocket of World War II, the X-15,
the Saturn Launch Vehicle of the Apollo program and continuing on to the present
day. Some of these are discussed in a monograph by Dowell [55] and also a NASA
Special Publication by Dowell [56]. See also Sect.3 of this paper.
Ithasbeenrecentlyrecognizedthatlowaspectratiowingsmaybehaveasstructural
plates and thus the entire wing may undergo a form of plate-like ﬂutter and limit cycle
oscillations. This has been seen in both wind tunnel models and computations to be
discussed later. However there is not yet a clearly documented case of such behavior
in ﬂight.
4.3
Physical Sources of Nonlinearities
Several physical sources of nonlinearities have been identiﬁed through mathematical
models (in almost all cases), wind tunnel tests (in several cases) and ﬂight tests (less
often). Among those most commonly studied and thought to be important are the
following. Large shock motions may lead to a nonlinear relationship between the
motion of the structure and the resulting aerodynamic pressures and forces that
act on the structure. If the ﬂow is separated (perhaps in part induced by the shock
motion) this may also create a nonlinear relationship between structural motion and
the consequent aerodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld.
Structural nonlinearities can also be important and are the result of a given (aero-
dynamic) force on the structure creating a response that is no longer (linearly) propor-
tional to the applied force. Freeplay and geometric nonlinearities are prime examples
(already mentioned). But the internal damping forces in a structure may also have a
nonlinear relationship to structural motion, with dry friction being an example that
has received limited attention to date. Because the structural damping is usually rep-
resented empirically even within the framework of linear aeroelastic mathematical
models, not much is known about the fundamental mechanisms of damping and their
impact on ﬂutter and LCO.
All of these nonlinear mechanisms have nevertheless been considered by the
mathematical modeling community and several have been the subject of wind tunnel
tests as well. In some cases good correlation between theory and experiment has
been obtained for limit cycle oscillation response.

Efﬁcient and Accurate Computation of Unsteady
Aerodynamic Forces: Linear and Nonlinear
The literature on unsteady aerodynamic forces alone is quite extensive. A compre-
hensive assessment of current practice in industry is given by Yurkovich, Liu and
Chen [57]. An article that focuses on recent developments is that of Dowell and
Hall [3]. Other recent and notable discussions include those of Bennett and Edwards
[58] and Lucia, Beran and Silva [4]. Much of the present focus of work on unsteady
aerodynamics is on developing accurate and efﬁcient computational models. Stan-
dard computational ﬂuid dynamic [CFD] models and solution methods that include
the relevant ﬂuid nonlinearities are simply too expensive now and for some time to
come for most aeroelastic analyses. Thus there has been much interest in reducing
computational costs while retaining the essence of the nonlinear ﬂow phenomena.
See Sect.3 of this paper.
4.5
Experimental/Theoretical Correlations
Much of what we know about the state of the art with respect to nonlinear aeroe-
lasticity comes from the study of correlations between experiment and theory and
between various levels of theoretical models. Hence the remainder of this discus-
sion is largely devoted to such correlations and the lessons learned from them. The
correlations selected are representative of the state of the art for transonic ﬂutter
boundaries and limit cycle oscillations.
4.5.1
Flutter Boundaries in Transonic Flow
AGARD 445.6 WING MODELS
Bennett and Edwards [58] have discussed the state of the art of Computational Aeroe-
lasticity (CAE) in a relatively recent paper and made several insightful comments
about various correlation studies. The NASA Langley team pioneered in providing
correlations for the AGARD 445.6 wing in the transonic ﬂow region. For this thin
wing, there are no signiﬁcant transonic effects in the steady ﬂow over the wing sur-
face at the Mach numbers with experimental results except for M = 0.96 where there
is a very weak shock on the surface. For the subsonic conditions, all computational
results are in very good agreement with experiment. However, the two low supersonic
test conditions have been problematic for CAE. Inviscid ﬂow (Euler) computations
have produced high ﬂutter speed index (FSI) values relative to the experimental FSI
and viscous ﬂow (Navier-Stokes) computations have accounted for about one half
the difference between theory and experiment. Several investigators have now done
similar Euler calculations and obtained similar results [59–61]. The excellent agree-
ment of the wholly linear theory results with experiment should probably be regarded

Some Recent Advances in Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
639
as fortuitous. Interestingly, Gupta [62], who also used an Euler based CFD model,
obtains results in better agreement with experiment at the low supersonic conditions,
though in less good agreement with experiment than the other Euler based results at
subsonic conditions. Thus, CAE computations for this low supersonic region have
unresolved issues which probably involve details such as wind tunnel wall interfer-
ence effects and ﬂutter test procedures, as well as CAE modeling issues.
HSCT Rigid and Flexible Semispan Models
Two semispan models representative of High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) con-
ﬁgurations were tested in the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics
Tunnel (TDT) in heavy gas. A Rigid Semispan Model (RSM) was tested mounted
on an Oscillating Turn Table (OTT) and on a Pitch And Plunge Apparatus (PAPA).
The RSM/OTT test [63] acquired unsteady pressure data due to pitching oscilla-
tions and the RSM/PAPA test acquired ﬂutter boundary data for simple pitching
and plunging motions. The RSM test [64] involved an aeroelastically-scaled model
and was mounted to the TDT sidewall. The test acquired unsteady pressure data
and ﬂutter boundary data. The results show the unexpectedly large effect of mean
angle of attack upon the ﬂutter boundaries for the RSM/PAPA model. Flutter of thin
wings at subsonic conditions is typically independent of angle-of-attack within the
linear ﬂow region. A region of increased response in ﬁrst wing bending (8.5 Hz.)
was encountered in the Mach number range of 0.90–0.98. Finally, a narrow region of
LCO behavior, labeled ‘chimney’, was encountered for M = 0.98 −1.00 and over
a wide range of dynamic pressures.
Benchmark Active Control Technology (BACT)
This rectangular wing model had an aspect ratio of two and a NACA 0012 airfoil
section [65, 66]. It was mounted on a pitching and plunging apparatus which allowed
ﬂutter testing with two structural degrees of freedom. It was extensively instrumented
with unsteady pressure sensors and accelerometers and it could be held ﬁxed (static)
for forced oscillation testing or free for dynamic response measurements. Data sets
for trailing-edge control surface oscillations and upper-surface spoiler oscillations
for a range of Mach numbers, angle of attack, α, and static control deﬂections are
available. The model exhibited three types of ﬂutter instability.
A classical ﬂutter boundary was found for α = 2◦, as a conventional boundary
of ﬂow density versus Mach number with a minimum, the transonic ‘dip’, near M
= 0.77 and a subsequent rise. Stall ﬂutter was found, for near the minimum of the
ﬂutter boundary (and at most tunnel conditions where high angles of attack could be
attained). Finally, a narrow region of instability occurred near M = 0.92 consisting
of plunging motion at the plunge mode wind-off frequency. This type of transonic
instability has sometimes been termed single-degree-of-freedom ﬂutter. It is caused
by the fore and aft motion of symmetric shocks on the upper and lower surfaces for
this wing. It was very sensitive to any biases and did not occur with nonzero control
surfacebias or nonzeroalpha. Suchastabilityboundaryfeatureis sometimes termeda
’chimney’ since the oscillations are typically slowly diverging or constant amplitude
(LCO) and it is found, sometimes, that safe conditions can be attained with small
further increases in Mach number.

E. H. Dowell
Computational studies by Kholodar et al. [67] were conducted to correlate with the
ﬂutter boundary obtained experimentally by Rivera et al. [67]. Kholodar’s inviscid
calculation agreed very well with the experimental ﬁndings except for M ≈0.88 to
M ≈0.95 where a “plunge instability region” occurred.
Experimental data for the ﬂutter boundary were not obtained at Mach numbers
just below the plunge instability region. Using an inviscid aerodynamic model in
the ﬂutter calculations, no ﬂutter solutions could be obtained for 0.82 < M < 0.92
except at very low ﬂow densities (inverse mass ratios). This is approximately the
same region for which experimental results were unavailable. Kholodar conjectured
this indicated that in this region, the ﬂutter mass ratio (inversely proportional to ﬂow
density or dynamic pressure) rose precipitously as the airfoil entered a single degree-
of-freedom ﬂutter mode. Conversely, ﬂow density (or inverse mass ratio) dropped
precipitously.
Viscous CFD results obtained by Schwarz et al. [68] revealed a number of sur-
prising characteristics. First, whereas inviscid aerodynamics made ﬂutter solutions
difﬁcult to ﬁnd in the region 0.82 ≤M ≤0.91 due to the sharp increase in ﬂutter
mass ratio, µ; by contrast, viscous results on a 193 x 49 CFD grid yielded readily
detectable solutions. However, these viscous solutions showed some sensitivity to
Mach number.
A grid reﬁnement study was performed by Schwarz et al. [68] to verify the results
obtained on the nominal 193 x 49 grid. The ﬂutter condition was recomputed on a
coarser 97 x 25 grid and also a ﬁne 385 x 97 grid at select Mach numbers, chosen
to be representative of the range of Mach numbers examined. This study showed
that the coarse 97 x 25 grid had insufﬁcient resolution and produced results in poor
agreement with experiment at low subsonic as well as transonic Mach numbers.
Results on the 385 x 97 computational mesh agreed with those on the nominal 193
x 49 mesh except for a narrow range of transonic Mach numbers. For M ≈0.84–0.86,
computations on this mesh showed ﬂow shedding to be occurring, a phenomenon
not seen on the coarser meshes (shedding or buffeting is an LCO of the ﬂow alone,
even in the absence of structural motion). The range in which this shedding occurred
agrees very closely with the Mach number range for which experimental results were
not obtained, approximately 0.82 < M < 0.88. As seen in Fig.12, predictions on the
193 x 49 and 385 x 97 viscous grids largely agreed outside of this shedding region.
Shedding or buffeting prohibits a linear ﬂutter analysis at the Mach numbers
for which it occurs, because it violates the assumption that the ﬂow behaves in a
dynamically linear way for small motions of the airfoil. Still, the present calculation
provides an insight into the ﬂutter experiment. The occurrence of shedding correlates
with the range of Mach numbers for which airfoil motions became erratic in the
experiments, indicating that shedding may have led to this unusual behavior.
F-16
The computed ﬂutter boundaries for eight F-16 wing/store conﬁgurations are shown
in Fig.13 in terms of altitude versus Mach number based upon standard atmospheric
conditions. Note the Mach number range over which ﬂutter may occur varies substan-
tially from one conﬁguration to the next. In these calculations, the viscous Reynolds

Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) version of the Duke University harmonic balance
solver was used [69]. Calculations for some of these conﬁgurations were also done
using an Euler version of the CFD code. In general, the Euler code provides similar
trends for the ﬂutter onset boundary, but there are some quantitative differences, i.e.
as much as 25
Note that in Fig.13 there are no results for Conﬁguration #7. This is because no
ﬂutter or LCO was found in the Mach number range shown which is in agreement
with the ﬂight test results. Also for conﬁguration #6, ﬂight tests were stopped at Mach
numbers less than the highest shown in Fig.13. Again no ﬂutter or LCO was found
in the ﬂight test in agreement with the computations. Moreover the computed ﬂutter
boundariesshowninFig.13generallyagreereasonablywellwiththeﬂighttestresults
as seen in Fig.14. Note that a range of Mach number is shown for conﬁguration #5
for both computed and ﬂight test results in Fig.14. This is because ﬂutter and LCO
occur over a range of Mach number for conﬁguration #5 with ﬂutter/LCO starting
at the lowest Mach number shown and ending at the highest Mach number shown.
Recall Fig.13. This is sometimes called a “hump” ﬂutter/LCO mode.
A comparison between measured and computed frequencies at Mach numbers just
beyond the onset of LCO for the several conﬁgurations where LCO was observed
shows the agreement is generally quite good and it is noted that the LCO frequency
does not vary rapidly with Mach number [69].

Limit Cycle Oscillations
Airfoils with structural stiffness and freeplay nonlinearities
Some investigators have considered conﬁgurations with a variety of nonlinear stiff-
ness and freeplay structural nonlinearities. For a description of the work on freeplay
nonlinearities, see the article by Dowell and Tang [70] which focuses on correlations
between theory and experiment as well as Sect.3.2 of the present paper. In general
good quantitative correlation is found for simple wind tunnel models and the basic
physical mechanism that leads to LCO appears well understood. Among the impor-
tant insights developed include the demonstration that the LCO amplitude and the
effect of mean angle of attack on LCO amplitude both simply scale in proportion
to the range of freeplay present in the aeroelastic system. This result has received
further conﬁrmation from the excellent study of Schlomach for the F-35 aircraft
program [18]. An example of another stiffness nonlinearity is described next.
Delta wings with geometrical plate nonlinearities
At low Mach numbers good correlation has been demonstrated between theory and
experiment for LCO amplitudes and frequencies. Since these results are well docu-
mented elsewhere, see Dowell and Tang [70], here the recent work of Gordnier et al.
[71, 72] that has extended these correlations into the transonic range for a cropped
delta wing planform is emphasized. This conﬁguration had been investigated exper-
imentally by Schairer and Hand [73] and the theoretical calculations were done by
Gordnier et al. using both Euler and Navier-Stokes ﬂow models. Initially the theoreti-
cal calculations were done using a linear structural model, which gave predicted LCO
amplitudes much greater than those observed experimentally. This led Gordnier to

includenonlinearities inthestructural model viaVonKarman’s nonlinear platetheory
that provided much improved correlation between theory and experiment. Note that
the effects of viscosity are modest based upon the good agreement of results using
the Euler vs Navier-Stokes models. Also the much improved agreement obtained
with the nonlinear structural model suggests that aerodynamic nonlinearities per se
are not as signiﬁcant for this conﬁguration as are the structural nonlinearities.
Large shock motions and ﬂow separation
These aerodynamic nonlinearities are both the most difﬁcult to model theoretically
and also to investigate experimentally. Hence it is not surprising that our correlations
between theory and experiment are not yet what we might like them to be. As
a corollary one might observe that it will in all likelihood be easier to design a
favorable nonlinear structural element to produce a benign LCO, than to assure that
ﬂow nonlinearities will always be beneﬁcial with respect to LCO.
4.5.3
AGARD 445.6 Wing Models
The AGARD 445.6 wing has been discussed earlier in terms of its ﬂutter boundary;
now we turn to results from Thomas, Dowell and Hall [74] for LCO. The correlation
between theory and experiment for the ﬂutter boundary is shown in Fig.15 where
the Euler ﬂow model is that of Thomas et al. But now we have in addition results
for LCO amplitude versus FSI for various Mach number. See Fig.16. Note that a
value of ﬁrst mode non-dimensional modal amplitude of ξ = 0.012 as shown in this

ﬁgure corresponds to a wing tip deﬂection equal to one fourth of the wing half-span.
Note there is no Mach number for which a benign LCO is predicted and subcritical
LCO is predicted at M = 1.141 and 1.072. This means that LCO may occur below
the ﬂutter boundary at these two Mach numbers and perhaps this explains at least in
part why ﬂutter (or really an unstable LCO) occurred in the experiment below the
predicted ﬂutter boundary.
Small amplitude LCO behavior for the AGARD 445.6 wing has also been calcu-
lated by Edwards [75]. The majority of published calculations for this wing model
(actually a series of models with similar planforms) are for the “weakened model
#3” tested in air, since this test covered the largest transonic Mach number range and
showed a signiﬁcant transonic dip in the ﬂutter boundary. The focus on this partic-
ular conﬁguration may be in some ways unfortunate, in that the model tested in air
resulted in unrealistically large mass ratios and small reduced frequencies. Weakened

Some Recent Advances in Nonlinear Aeroelasticity
645
models #5 and #6 were tested in heavy gas and had smaller mass ratios and higher
reduced frequencies. Very good agreement was obtained with experiment for ﬂutter
speed index using the CAP-TSDV code over the Mach number range tested. For the
highest Mach number tested, M = 0.96, it was noted that damping levels extracted
from the computed transients were amplitude dependent, an indicator of nonlinear
behavior. It was also found that small amplitude divergent (in time) responses used
to infer the ﬂutter boundary would transition to LCO when the calculation was con-
tinued further in time. The wing tip amplitude of the LCO was approximately 0.12
inches peak-to-peak, a level that is unlikely to be detected in wind tunnel tests given
the levels of model response to normal wind tunnel turbulence.
4.5.4
MAVRIC Wing Flutter Model
This business jet wing-fuselage model (see Edwards [76, 77]) was chosen by NASA
Langley Research Center’s Models For Aeroelastic Validation Involving Computa-
tion (MAVRIC) project with the goal of obtaining experimental wind-tunnel data
suitable for Computational Aeroelasticity (CAE) code validation at transonic sep-
aration onset conditions. LCO behavior was a primary target. An inexpensive con-
struction method of stepped-thickness aluminum plate covered with end-grain balsa
wood and contoured to the desired wing proﬁle was used. A signiﬁcant beneﬁt of this
method was the additional strength of the plate that enabled the model to withstand
large amplitude LCO motions without damage.
The behavior of the MAVRIC model as ﬂutter was approached during the wind
tunnel test indicated that wing motions tended to settle to a large amplitude LCO
condition, especially in the Mach number range near the minimum FSI conditions.
Figure 17 demonstrates [77] the ability of the CAP-TSDV code to simulate these
large amplitude LCO motions. Large and small initial condition disturbance transient
responses clearly show the six inch peak-to-peak wingtip motions observed in the
tests. Such large amplitude aeroelastic motions have not been demonstrated by RANS
CFD codes which have difﬁculty maintaining grid cell structure for signiﬁcant grid
deformations. Figure 18 shows the map of the regions of LCO found in the MAVRIC
test in the vicinity of the minimum FSI (clean wingtip, α = 6◦) [77]. Numbers for the
several contours in the ﬁgure give the half-amplitude of wingtip LCO motions, in g’s,
in the indicated regions. Two regions, signiﬁed by ’B’, are regions where ’beating’
vibrations were observed. For this test condition, wing motions are predominantly
of the wing ﬁrst bending mode at a frequency of 7–8 Hz. (wind-off modal frequency
is 4.07 Hz.). Two chimney features are seen, at M ∼0.91 and at M ∼0.94. Edwards
discusses ﬂutter model responses which are indicative of more complex nonlinear
behaviors than are commonly attributed to LCO. Thus, ﬂutter test engineers are
familiar with responses such as ’bursting’ and ’beating’, commonly used as indicators
of the approach to ﬂutter (and LCO).

Clipped-Tip Delta Wing Control Surface Buzz Model
Parker et al. [78] describe a test of a clipped-tip delta wing model with a full span
control surface. The tests were conducted in air which is of concern since there
are known to be severe Reynolds number and/or transition effects for this tunnel at
dynamic pressures below 50–75 pounds per square foot. Pak and Baker [79] have
performed computational studies of this case. They compare the experimental buzz
boundary with time-marching transient responses calculated with the CFL3D-NS
code and the CAP-TSDV code, respectively. Both codes capture LCO behavior near
the experimental buzz conditions with the higher level code appearing to have better
agreement for the experimental trend versus Mach number. The record lengths of a
numberoftheresponses,whichareextremelyexpensivetocompute,arenotsufﬁcient
for clear determination of the response ﬁnal status. Also, LCO behaviors can result
from very delicate force balances and settling times to ﬁnal LCO states can require
many cycles of oscillation.

Residual Pitch Oscillations on the B-2
The B-2 bomber encountered a nonlinear aeroelastic Residual Pitch Oscillation
(RPO) during low altitude high speed ﬂight [53]. Neither the RPO nor any tendency
of lightly damped response had been predicted by wholly linear aeroelastic design
methods. The RPO involved symmetric wing bending modes and rigid body degrees
of freedom. It was possible to augment the CAP-TSDV aeroelastic analysis code with
capability for the longitudinal short-period rigid body motions, vehicle trim, and the
full-time active ﬂight control system including actuator dynamics. This computa-
tional capability enabled the analysis of the heavyweight, forward center of gravity
ﬂight condition [53]. The simulation predicts open loop instability at M = 0.775 and
closed loop instability at M = 0.81 in agreement with ﬂight test. In order to capture
thelimitcyclebehavioroftheRPOitwasnecessarytoincludemodelingofthenonlin-
ear hysteretic response characteristic of the B-2 control surfaces for small amplitude
motions. This is caused by the small overlap of the servohydraulic control valve
spool ﬂanges with their mating hydraulic ﬂuid oriﬁces. With this realistic actuator
modeling also included, limited amplitude RPO motions similar to those measured
in ﬂight were simulated. A lighter weight ﬂight test conﬁguration exhibited very light
damping near M = 0.82 but did not exhibit fully developed RPO. Instead damping
increased with slight further increase in speed, typical of hump mode behavior. The
CAP-TSDV simulations did not capture this hump mode behavior.

In Fig.19, a comparison of computational and ﬂight test results is shown for Con-
ﬁguration #1 for both the ﬂutter boundary and also for LCO response [69]. This is a
plot of wing tip acceleration response versus Mach number at a ﬁxed altitude of 2000
feet. The ﬂight test results are shown by the curve with open circles. Three different
computational results are shown. The curve with open squares shows the results for
the nominal conﬁguration with the aerodynamics of the stores neglected. The curve
with open triangles includes the effects of the aerodynamics of the wing tip launcher
using slender body aerodynamic theory. Note this curve is in better agreement with
the ﬂight test data. Finally the curve with open diamonds is for a one percent change
in one of the structural frequencies. Here the computational model has been “tuned”
to the experiment to give better agreement with the measured LCO frequency. That in
turn has led to better agreement between computation and measurement for the LCO
amplitude. Of course if a change in structural frequency in the opposite direction is
made, this leads to poorer agreement between computations and ﬂight test with the
LCO response curve moving a similar amount from the nominal response but in the
opposite direction. So what has been shown by the “tuning” is that the results for this
conﬁguration are sensitive to small plausible changes in the structural frequencies.

Fig. 20 Buffet boundary: angle of attack versus mach number
A ﬁnal word about the correlation between computations and ﬂight test is war-
ranted. Note that the computations show a precise Mach number at which ﬂutter and
the onset of LCO occurs, i.e. when the wing tip acceleration is zero. This is because
we have neglected the gust response of the aircraft to atmospheric turbulence as is
traditional in ﬂutter and LCO calculations. Of course in the ﬂight test there is always
some (small) response even when there is no ﬂutter or LCO due to atmospheric tur-
bulence. Thus it is impossible to deﬁne a precise Mach number at which ﬂutter begins
from the ﬂight test data shown in Fig.20. Indeed inferring a ﬂutter Mach number
from ﬂight test data is a difﬁcult art and requires a deeper study of the test data than
simply a plot such as shown in Fig.19. On the other hand, for the present purpose,
this is not crucial. From Fig.19, it is clear that neither ﬂutter nor LCO is occurring
for Mach numbers less than M∞= 0.8, but ﬂutter onset and LCO do occur for Mach
numbers greats than M∞= 0.85. And thus one can compare the computed ﬂutter
Mach number to this range from the test data. For LCO per se, the major goals are
predicting the maximum LCO response level and the frequency and structural modal
content of the LCO. The frequency and modal content are well predicted by the
computational model [69], and the maximum response is reasonably well predicted
as well for this conﬁguration. See Fig.19. Note in particular that both ﬂight test and
computations show the ﬂutter and LCO motion is anti-symmetric.

Time Marching Codes Compared to Various Experimental
Results
In the paper by Huttsell et al. [80] several state of the art time marching CFD codes are
used to investigate ﬂutter and LCO for challenging cases drawn from ﬂight or wind
tunnel tests. The CAP-TSD, CAP-TSDV, CFL3D and ENS3DAE codes are all used.

E. H. Dowell
The results are extremely helpful in providing a realistic assessment of the state of the
art of these codes and they are also indicative future needs and improvements. For the
F-15 aircraft example, difﬁculty was encountered in producing a computational grid
with negative volumes being encountered. For the AV8-B aircraft a steady state ﬂow
ﬁeld could not be found due to oscillations in the numerical solver from one iteration
to the next. These difﬁculties are not unusual for CFD codes in the present authors’
experience. Sometimes the difﬁculty in achieving a steady ﬂow solution is attributed
to shedding in the ﬂow ﬁeld, but in the absence of a full nonlinear dynamic CFD
calculation, that must remain a speculation. For the B-2 aircraft example encouraging
agreement was obtained for the frequency and damping variation of the critical ﬂutter
(and LCO) mode as a function of ﬂight speed using the CAP-TSDV code. For the B-1
estimates of the damping associated with LCO were computed using the CFL3DAE
code and favorably compared to those found in wind tunnel tests. It is not entirely
clear what the “damping” of an LCO means, however, since by deﬁnition LCO is
a neutrally stable motion. Two control surface “buzz” cases were considered and
CFL3DAE had some success in predicting the behavior observed in the wind tunnel
for a NASP like conﬁguration.
As Huttsell et al. [80] note, additional work is needed to improve CFD model
robustness, computational efﬁciency and grid deformation strategies.

Aerodynamic LCO: Buffet, AWS and NSV
The aerodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld itself can become unstable even in the absence of any
structural motion. Of course, once the ﬂow ﬁeld becomes unstable, then oscillations
in the ﬂow will begin and due to aerodynamic nonlinearities such as shock motion
and/ﬂow separation a limit cycle oscillation may (and usually will) occur. This purely
aerodynamically generated LCO may then drive the structure into motion and the
structural motion may in turn modify the LCO. Often in practice it is difﬁcult to
distinguish this type of LCO from one that occurs because of an inherent aeroelas-
tically generated LCO in which the aerodynamic ﬂow per se is stable. Of course in
mathematical models this distinction can be (but is not always) made clear. But in a
wind tunnel or ﬂight test it is more difﬁcult to distinguish between these two different
LCO scenarios.
Even so, in recent years considerable progress has been made in understanding
aerodynamically generated LCO and subsequent aeroelastic effects. This progress
is brieﬂy summarized here and the promise of greater progress in the future is sub-
stantial.
In classical aerodynamics the transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow is one of
the most important examples of a steady (laminar) ﬂuid ﬂow becoming unstable
and thus leading to a (turbulent) ﬂuid ﬂow LCO. Determining the properties of this
LCO of turbulence remains one of the great unresolved issues of all of science and
engineering. However there are also other examples of ﬂow instabilities which go by
such names as buffet, abrupt wing stall (AWS) and non synchronous vibration (NSV),

that have received much attention in aerospace (and other) research and engineering
applications. Typically, in these examples the ﬂow is already turbulent, but a further
dynamic instability occurs whose intensity is far greater than typical turbulence (e.g.
the oscillating lift coefﬁcient is of order unity) and whose length scale is of the order
of the airfoil or wing dimensions. By contrast, turbulence per se occurs over a great
range of length scales including length scales much smaller than a wing chord or
span and the intensity is a small fraction of the mean ﬂow values.
Here we discuss the work of Edwards [81], Barakos [82] and Raveh [83–85] on
buffet and are content to cite some of the key literature on AWS and NSV.
There is a well known experiment by McDevitt and Okuno [86] that considers
the dynamic instability of the ﬂow about a NACA 0012 airfoil in transonic ﬂow
conditions at certain prescribed angles of attack. The airfoil itself does not move,
but the ﬂow oscillates in what today might be called a limit cycle oscillation (LCO),
but is more commonly referred to as a buffeting ﬂow. Several investigators have
undertaken computations to compare with these experiments. Edwards [77] has con-
sidered a potential ﬂow model for the outer ﬂow coupled to an integral boundary
layer model and shown excellent agreement with the measured data for the buffet
(LCO) boundary. This boundary is expressed in terms of angle of attack versus Mach
number and separates the no buffet (no LCO) region from the buffet (LCO) region.
Barakos [78] has also done an interesting study where various turbulence models are
used in a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computation and shown that
the k-omega and Spalart-Allmaras turbulence models also give good correlation for
the buffet (LCO) boundary and the buffet (LCO) frequency. Figure 20 is a compar-
ison of the computed and measured buffet boundary from Barakos [78], who also
shows that other commonly used turbulence models such as k-epsilon fail altogether
to predict the buffet boundary. Hence buffet experiments [82] and correlations with
computational models may give essential and fundamental insights into the required
computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) models for unsteady aerodynamic ﬂows.
Very recently Raveh et al. [83–85] have studied the effect of a prescribed airfoil
motion on a buffeting ﬂow. Many interesting ﬁndings have been uncovered including
the possibility of “lock-in”. Lock-in occurs when response at the inherent ﬂow buffet
frequency is suppressed and the ﬂow as well as the airfoil oscillates at the frequency
of the prescribed airfoil motion. This occurs for certain combinations of the airfoil
motion amplitude and frequency. The larger the airfoil motion, the wider the range
of structural frequency (near the buffet ﬂow frequency) for which lock-in will occur.
Recently Raveh et al. [84] have considered the case of an elastically mounted airfoil
which is free to move, but for which there is no prescribed motion. Again lock in is
found under certain conditions. It is an open question of how often this may occur
in wind tunnel tests or ﬂight tests of aeroelastic systems. However the BACT wind
tunnel model discussed earlier [65–68], an elastically mounted rigid wing with a
NACA 0012 airfoil proﬁle, is an intriguing example of where such oscillations may
have occurred.
Figure21 is from [85] and shows the time histories of lift on the NACA 0012
airfoil as the angle of attack is increased in prescribed steps of 0.5◦from 4.5◦and
then decreased in steps starting from 8.5◦. Outside the range of angle of attack for

which buffet occurs, a transient decay of the lift illustrates the approach to a time
independent steady ﬂow. By contrast, inside the range of angle of attack for which
buffet occurs, the long time response is a periodic oscillation of the lift (and other
ﬂow variables).

Fig. 22 Frequency content of lift coefﬁcient response to prescribed airfoil motion of various ampli-
tudes and frequencies: αm = 6◦, Mach 0.72, Re 1E7
Then a prescribed airfoil motion is added and the effect of this motion on the
buffet limit cycle oscillation is found. Figure 22 is also from [85] and shows the
lift response on the airfoil for various cases of prescribed airfoil motion amplitudes
and frequencies. This illustrates the approach to lock in when the frequency and
amplitude of the prescribed motion are in the appropriate ranges. Figure 23 shows
the range for which lock-in occurs in a plot of motion amplitude versus frequency.
The study of buffeting (and its counterparts of abrupt wing stall and non-
synchronous vibration) appears ripe for even more signiﬁcant advances and also
suggests the need for further experiments building on the earlier wind tunnel tests
of McDevitt and Okuno and the NASA Langley team with the BACT wind tunnel
model. In particular the computational results suggest that one can exit the buffet
region by continuing to increase the angle of attack at a given Mach number. Also
the computational models are now capable of predicting the buffeting (LCO) ampli-
tudes. Neither of these predictions have yet been validated by experiments, but these
important issues could be addressed in new experiments that extend the earlier test
results.

Abrupt Wing Stall (AWS) appears to be a particular form of buffet, but with two
possible caveats. First of all, the instability of the aircraft ﬂow ﬁeld appears to be
asymmetric and/or anti-symmetric with respect to the fuselage and thus gives rise to
an oscillating rolling moment that leads to what is sometimes called “wing drop”.
At least a dozen distinct aircraft have encountered this phenomenon over several
decades, but the ability to predict when it will occur is still beyond current com-
putational modeling methods. Nevertheless there is real hope that this will become
possible with a suitable CFD model in the near to mid-term future. Also it is still
uncertain to what degree aeroelastic feedback is an issue including the rigid body
motions in roll. Much of the recent work on AWS has been done in the context of the
F-18 program which devoted very substantial effort to resolving this issue for that
aircraft. For a summary and citation to recent literature, see for example [1].
Non-Synchronous Vibration (NSV) appears to be in substantial part a form of
buffet encountered in turbomachinery. For an introduction to the literature on NSV,
see [87]. It has also been called “Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV)”. This ﬁrst attempt
by Duke University to investigate NSV was in 2003 by Kielb, Hall, Barter and
Thomas. This study presented experimental evidence of NSV in the form of strain
gaugedataonacompressortestrigaswellasunsteadycasingpressuremeasurements.
Using computational ﬂuid dynamics, the NSV frequency was determined, and was
within 9 percent of the experimental frequency. Other results from this study include
identifying NSV as arising from an unsteady suction side vortex and a tip ﬂow
instability.
While a large-scale computational ﬂuid dynamic simulation was a good way to
search for NSV, Sanders points out in 2005 that the underlying ﬂow physics must

ﬁrst be understood, then increasingly complex conﬁgurations can be studied [88]. As
a result, several works focused on cylinders, symmetric airfoils, and cascades, rather
than full annulus compressors and turbines. In addition, advanced computational
methods such as the Harmonic Balance method and Reduced Order Modeling (see
chaps.13 and 9 respectively) replace traditional time-marching simulations when
applicable.
Spiker analyzed a cylinder under enforced motion near the lock-in region [89].
Lock-in occurs when the shedding frequency jumps onto the enforced frequency.
This behavior was validated experimentally as well. Results agreed very well for
a two-dimensional cylinder, moderately well for a two-dimensional airfoil, yet not
so well for the three-dimensional case. In addition, the harmonic balance method
was used to analyze the behavior of ﬂow through cascades. The design methods
resembled those of linear ﬂutter analyses, but for the nonlinear behavior of LCO
associated with NSV.
Clark’s work primarily focused on coupled mode ﬂutter; however, work was
also completed on NSV [90]. He proposed a Reduced Order Model to study NSV
around a cylinder. It was a coupled model, one degree of freedom captured the
motion of a cylinder with mass, stiffness, and damping while the other captured
the oscillatory motion of the wake. The latter utilized a Van der Pol Oscillator to
capture the lock-in behavior of a cylinder experiencing NSV as well as a stable limit
cycle oscillation (LCO). Clark later expanded on the model, incorporating Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD).
To further explore cylinders, Besem expanded on the work using POD to study
cylinders vibrating transversely and in line with the ﬂow [91]. It was concluded that
transverse oscillations lead to alternating shedding while inline oscillations lead to
symmetric shedding. These conclusions came from utilizing POD methods to create
a ROM, which can predict results faster and as accurate as full computational models,
requiring at least two degrees of freedom and two harmonics. In addition, Besem
and Tang performed experimental studies on the lock-in region for a NACA 0012
airfoil [92]. They found that the lock-in region to experiments is wider, capturing the
chaotic edge region between locked and unlocked. In addition, the locked-in region
can be split into two groups: positive and negative equivalent aerodynamic damping.
Current work includes extending the van der Pol based ROM, further experimen-
tal studies, and more complex CFD simulations. Results by Hollenbach [93] show
greater agreement to experimental LCO lock-in data using a 2 DOF ROM for a cylin-
der in transverse ﬂow, utilizing system identiﬁcation methods to tune the coefﬁcients
and including nonlinear stiffness terms. Figure 24 shows the improved results, which
can be compared to those found in [94]. In addition, further studies on lock-in for the
ﬂow around a NACA 0012 airfoil are being conducted to develop an understanding
of the behavior of the unsteady pressures for increasing oscillation amplitude.
One of the most interesting aspects of buffet is the relatively benign time signatures
of the lift (and moment) oscillations on an airfoil or wing. See Fig.21. The lift
oscillation is not only periodic, but nearly simple harmonic. Yet this is a result of a
nonlinearlimitcycleoscillationoftheﬂuidandinvolvessubstantialshockoscillations
and in at least some cases separated ﬂow. How can this be?

Reynold’s number
Some years ago, Williams [95] showed using transonic potential ﬂow theory that
as the motion of an airfoil or wing becomes small, the shock displacement is linearly
proportional to the airfoil or wing motion and the lift and moment (and indeed
all generalized forces) are linearly proportional to the airfoil or wing motion. This
is a remarkable result because the pressure distribution along the airfoil is highly
nonlinear even for small motions if one examines a position on the airfoil over which
the shock moves. Williams was able to show these results analytically for the potential
ﬂow model and subsequent numerical computations using Euler and Navier-Stokes
ﬂuid models have conﬁrmed a similar result.
A recent paper by Woodgate and Badcock [96] has a nice result that graphically
illustrates this point for an Euler ﬂow model. At the many points along the airfoil
that are not traversed by the shock motion, the pressure is nearly harmonic in time
as illustrated by the nearly elliptical phase plane plot of pressure versus angle of
oscillating motion of the airfoil (not shown here). On the other hand at the points
along the airfoil that are traversed by the shock motion, the pressure time history
although periodic has many higher harmonics as well. These computations were
done using a harmonic balance method [3, 4] and Woodgate and Badcock show that
many higher harmonics are indeed needed to resolve the local pressure time history
when the point on the airfoil is traversed by the shock. In Fig.25 results are shown
for one, two, four, eight and sixteen harmonics. The good news for the modeling of
aeroelastic systems is that the generalized forces including lift and moment do not
usually have this higher harmonic content unless the airfoil or wing motions are very
large (an effective angle of attack near the stall angle) because of the spatial ﬁltering
that occurs due to integration over the airfoil chord or wing area when computing
lift, moment and other generalized forces.

Concluding Remarks
Substantial progress has been made in modeling and understanding nonlinear aeroe-
lastic phenomena. Experimental and theoretical investigations have shown good cor-
relation for a number of nonlinear physical mechanisms. As a broad generalization,
one may say that our understanding of and correlation among alternative theoreti-

cal models and experiment is further advanced for nonlinear structural mechanisms
such as freeplay and large deﬂection geometric nonlinearities of beams and plates,
than it is for nonlinear ﬂuid mechanisms such as large shock motions and separated
ﬂows. Nevertheless more accurate and much more computationally efﬁcient theoret-
ical models are now becoming available for nonlinear aerodynamic ﬂows and there
is cause for optimism in addressing these issues going forward.
As has been emphasized throughout this paper, a number of physical mechanisms
can lead to nonlinear aeroelastic response including the impact of static (steady ﬂow)
ﬂuid or static structural nonlinearities in changing the ﬂutter boundary of an aeroelas-
tic system. Of course dynamic nonlinearities play a critical role in the development
of limit cycle oscillations, hysteresis in ﬂutter and LCO response, and the sensitivity
of both to initial and external disturbances.
The good news for the ﬂight vehicle designer is that because of nonlinear aeroelas-
tic effects, ﬁnite amplitude oscillations can in some cases replace what would other-
wise be the rapidly growing and destructive oscillations of classical ﬂutter behavior.
A careful consideration and design of favorable nonlinearities offers a new oppor-
tunity for improved performance and safety of valuable wind tunnel models, ﬂight
vehicles, their operators and passengers.
Finally and inevitably some important topics have been omitted due to space
and time limitations. The insightful article on rotorcraft aeroelasticity by Friedmann
[97] is highly recommended; for turbomachinery aeroelasticity, see the authoritative
volume edited by Hall, Kielb and Thomas [98] and for an entrée to the literature
on morphing aircraft such as the folding wing concept see the paper by Attar et al.
[99]. The work of Batina [100] on advanced concepts in transonic small disturbance
potential ﬂow theory and computation also reminds us that there are still valuable
opportunities for signiﬁcant advances in that ﬁeld as well.

Aeroelastic Models Design/Experiment
and Correlation with New Theory
Deman Tang and Earl H. Dowell
Abstract Several examples of experimental model designs, wind tunnel tests and
correlation with new theory are presented in this chapter. The goal is not only to
evaluate a new theory, new computational method or new aeroelastic phonomenon,
but also to provide new insights into nonlinear aeroelastic phenomena, ﬂutter, limit
cycle oscillation (LCO), gust response and energy harvesting from a large ﬂapping
ﬂag response. The experiments are conducted in a standard low speed wind tunnel.
Similar experiments in a high speed wind tunnel would be very valuable.

Introduction
A very important function of wind tunnel models and testing is to verify a new
aeroelastic theory or a new computational method. For this purpose, experimental
aeroelastic model design and manufacturing of scaled models, model ground vibra-
tion test and wind tunnel testing are essential to success. In the past 20 years, the
Duke aeroelastic group has designed many aeroelastic models and conducted wind
tunnel tests to evaluate new theoretical aeroelastic theories and new computations
methods. They include:
1. A high aspect ratio wing model. Several correlation studies for ﬂutter and limit
cycle oscillation [1], limit cycle hysteresis response [2], gust response for clamped
and ﬂexibly suspended models [3, 4] and Flutter/LCO suppression [5] were per-
formed.
2. Wing like plate models, delta wing-store, ﬂapping ﬂag, yawed plate and folding
wing. The wind tunnel tests were used to evaluate the von Karman nonlinear plate
theory and a new nonlinear inextensible beam and plate theory and also some high

for ﬂutter/LCO [6–16] and gust response studies [17–19] were performed.
3. Airfoil section with control surface freeplay. The wing tunnel tests were used to
evaluate new approachs for the freeplay nonlinear and gust responses including
Duke computational codes using the Peter’s ﬁnite state airload aerodynamic the-
ory, harmonic balance method and the time marching integration based on state
space equations [20–24] and the ZAERO code [25] based on the computational
ﬂuid dynamic (CFD) theory conducted by ZONA Technology, Inc.

a computational code has been developed and evaluated.
5. A free-to-roll fuselage ﬂutter model [28]. From measured wind tunnel data, one
evaluates the predicted symmetric and anti-symmetric ﬂutter/LCO theory.
6. A experimental oscillating airfoil model at high angles of attack for measuring
aerodynamic response. A frequency “Lock-in” phenomenon is found in buffeting
ﬂow and compared to the theoretical results [29]. Also a experimental airfoil

7. The structural design of RSC/airfoil gust generator that is used to create a lateral
gust in the Duke University low speed wind tunnel has been developed. The
design principle of this generator has been veriﬁed by the coorelation between the
experimental and numerical simulation when the RSC rotating angle is statically
rotated from 0◦to 180◦, see [59, 60]. Using this gust generator, the theoretical
and experimental correlation study of gust response for a high-aspect-ratio wing
modelwasusedtoevaluatethegustﬂowﬁeldandnonlinearbeamstructuraltheory.
8. Two experimental models are constructed, i.e. partially covered and fully covered,
cantilevered plates with piezoelectric patch and ﬁlm sensor that are used to study
energy harvesting from a large ﬂapping ﬂag response, see [63–65]. Two different
experimental methods are used to obtain large ﬂapping vibrations, a mechanically
forced vibration and a limit cycle oscillation from an aeroelastic responses. AC
voltage outputs from the piezo patch or ﬁlm sensors and a DC power extraction
through a AC/DC convert circuit are obtained. These experiments are used to
evaluate a new computational model and code for an aero-electromechanical
interaction system.
Several examples of model designs, wind tunnel tests and experimental/theoretical
correlation studies with the theory are presented in this chapter. The goal is not only to
evaluate a new theory, new computational method or new aeroelactic phonomenon,
but also to provide new insights into nonlinear aeroelastic phenomena, ﬂutter/LCO
and gust response and energy harvesting.

Experimental Models for Measuring Flutter/Limit Cycle
Oscillation (LCO) Response to Evaluate A Nonlinear
Structural Theory
Theoretical and experimental correlation study for the aeroelastic stability and
response of an aircraft with a high-aspect-ratio wing and low-aspect-ratio wing have
been studied for many years from subsonic to supersonic ﬂow. Most investigators
have used linear beam and plate theories to simplify the wing structural model. How-
ever, a geometric structural nonlinearity may arise from the coupling between elastic
ﬂap or vertical bending, chordwise or edgewise bending and torsion for very high
aspect ratio wings typical of Uninhabited Air Vehicles (UAV) and also for the low
aspect ratio wings. Here, two kinds of experimental wing models, a high altitude long
endurance (HALE) model and a wing-like (plate) model are considered to evaluate
the new nonlinear structural theories.
2.1
High Altitude Long Endurance Models (Nonlinear Beam
Structural Theory and ONERA Aerodynamic Model)
An experimental high-aspect ratio wing aeroelastic model with a tip mass has been
constructed and a wind tunnel test conducted to measure the static aeroelastic
response, ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations. The goal is to assess experimentally
the theoretical results using nonlinear structural and aerodynamic theories. The the-
oretical structural equations of motion are based on nonlinear beam theory by Hodges
and Dowell [31] and the ONERA aerodynamic stall model [32].
Theexperimentalmodelincludestwoparts:ahigh-aspectratiowingwithaslender
body at the tip and a root support mechanism. The wing is rectangular, untwisted
and ﬂexible in the ﬂap, lag and torsional directions. The wing is constructed from
a precision ground ﬂat steel spar with mass uniformly distributed along the wing
span. The spar is 45.72cm in length, 1.27cm in width and 0.127cm in thickness. It is
inserted tightly into the wing root mechanism. In order to reduce torsional stiffness,
the spar has multiple thin ﬂanges along the span. The ﬂange width is 0.127cm and it is
0.318cm in deep. There are 2 × 33 ﬂanges uniformly and symmetrically distributed
along the wing span and center line of the spar. There are 18 pieces of NACA 0012
airfoil plate uniformly distributed along the span. The pieces of the airfoil plate are
made of aluminum alloy with 0.254cm thickness. A precision aerodynamic contour
of the wing model is obtained. Each airfoil plate has a slot 1.27cm in width and
0.127cm in thickness at the symmetry line. The spar is inserted through these airfoil
plate slots and they are permanently bonded together. Each space between two airfoil
plates is ﬁlled with a light wood (bass) covering the entire chord and span which
provides the aerodynamic contour of the wing. This wood provides a slight additional
mass and a small addition to the bending and torsion stiffness.

A slender body is attached to the elastic axis of the wing tip. The slender body is an
aluminum bar, 0.95cm in diameter and 10.16cm in length. A paraboloidal forebody
and an aftbody with 1.14cm length are ﬁxed to two ends of the bar. The forebody
and aftbody are made of brass.
The slender body is symmetrical and is designed to provide enough torsional
inertia to reduce the natural torsional frequency sufﬁciently to induce ﬂutter in the
velocity range of the wind tunnel.
The root support mechanism is a socket that allows a change of the steady angle
of attack at the root. The root socket is mounted to the mid point of side-wall of the
wind tunnel
Figure1a shows a photograph of the aeroelastic wing model in the wind tunnel.
Axial strain gages for bending modes and a 45◦oriented strain gage for torsional
modes were glued to the root spar to measure the bending-torsional deﬂections of
the wing. Signals from the strain gages were conditioned and ampliﬁed before their

A Helium-Neon Laser with 0.8mw randomly polarized and wavelength 633 (nm)

wing. A “mirror” deﬂection technique is used to determine the geometric twist angle
and the vertical or ﬂapwise bending slope at the wing tip.
All static, ﬂutter and LCO response tests were performed in the Duke University
low speed wind tunnel. The wind tunnel is a closed circuit tunnel with a test section of
0.7 × 0.53m2 and a length of 1.52 m. The maximum air speed attainable is 89.3m/s.

The reﬂected light source point with wing deﬂection as marked on the readout paper
is then determined as the ﬂow velocity is varied.
Figure1b shows the the theoretical and experimental results of the tip ﬂapwise
deﬂection for a steady angle of attack, θ0 = 1◦. The solid line indicates the theoretical
results and the bar indicates the measured data. The experimental data appear have
some scatter due to the turbulent aerodynamic noise, although the noise is small.
A very high measurement sensitivity is obtained from the mirror technique. We
use a bar in the ﬁgure to indicate the magnitude of the response uncertainty. As
shown Fig.1b, the tip deﬂection increase with increasing ﬂow velocity, but the tip
deﬂection is always negative until the ﬂow velocity reaches 34.5m/s. At that velocity
the aerodynamic forces provide sufﬁcient lift to overcome the effect of gravity. At
U = 34.5m/s, the system enters into the ﬂutter instability range. The consequent
LCO has a certain non-zero mean or temporal average and this is shown by a dashed
line in Fig.1b. Also with LCO, aerodynamic stall occurs and the lift coefﬁcient Cl
suddenly decreases. The measured data in Fig.1b are acquired before the onset of
ﬂutter and LCO. The experimental data fall near the theoretical curves in Fig.1b. In
general, the agreement is good except for some points at U = 10 and 15m/s. In the
higher ﬂow velocity range, the data ﬂuctuation increases due to greater aerodynamic
turbulence.
A typical LCO amplitude and LCO frequency versus ﬂow velocity for θ0 = 1◦
and at the mid span position are shown in Fig.1c and d, respectively. The theoretical
and experimental amplitudes are taken as rms average values from a 50s sampling
interval. The symbols, ◦and •, indicate the experimental results for increasing and
decreasing ﬂow velocity, respectively. The solid and broken lines (without symbols)
indicate the theoretical results for increasing and decreasing ﬂow velocity, respec-
tively. The symbol, △, indicates the linear ﬂutter velocity which is calculated from the
perturbation eigenvalue solution. For the increasing ﬂow velocity case, the theoretical
limit cycle oscillation occurs when the ﬂow velocity is larger than the perturbation
ﬂutter velocity and the amplitude has a jump from almost rest to a larger value.
Once the onset of LCO occurs, the amplitude increases smoothly with increasing the
ﬂow velocity. When U > 38.6m/s, a numerical or possibly a physical divergence is
found in the theoretical model. For the case of decreasing ﬂow velocity, as shown
by the broken line, the LCO amplitude decreases, but does not exactly coincide with
those for the increasing velocity case. Also there is a jump in the LCO response at
U = 33.5 m/s which is a distinctly lower velocity than that found for the increasing
velocity case (i.e. U = 34.5m/s).
The present experimental and theoretical results provide new insights into non-
linear aeroelastic phenomena of LCO beyond the linear ﬂutter speed for high aspect
ratio wings. Also these results show the nonlinear equations and stall aerodynamic
equations provided by Hodges and Dowell and ONERA, respectively, provide useful
and accurate results for HALE vehicles.

Flapping Flag and Yawed Plate Models (Nonlinear
Inextensible Beam and Plate Theory)
There is a substantial literature on inextensible beam theory, but relatively little on
inextensible plate theory. A notable exception is the work of J. G. Simmonds and
colleagues [33–36] on inextensible plate theory. His approach is quite different from
the present one and ultimately leads to a system of ordinary differential equations
for the plate deformation for a one dimensional generator curve from which the
entire plate deformation may then be deduced. In the present new inextensible theory
of beam and plate deformation as described in [37], the formulation is based upon
Hamilton’s Principle in terms of a single unknown, i.e. the beam or plate deformation
normal to its surface. The present approach has some substantial computational
advantages, but certainly the work of Simmonds is elegant and pioneering.
The interaction between a cantilevered elastic plate and a uniform axial ﬂow
is a canonical ﬂuid-structure interaction problem. If the ﬂow is oriented parallel
to the clamped leading edge the system is described as a wing-like conﬁguration.
If the ﬂow is oriented normal to the clamped edge then the system is referred to
as ﬂag-like. There is extensive research on the aeroelastic response of the wing-
like conﬁguration due to the similarities between the simple cantilevered beam and
aircraft wings. The present study differs from the classic explorations of the swept
wing due to the application of the clamped boundary condition. For a traditional
swept wing conﬁguration the clamp is applied parallel to the ﬂow, changing the
shape of the structure for every angle (it is called the yaw angle, β, in the present
paper). For the current study the clamped edge is rotated with the structure. In this
case the second classic ﬂuid structure interaction problem for a clamped-free elastic
plate will be considered, i.e. the ﬂag-like conﬁguration.
References [12, 13] focus on exploring the transition of the limit cycle oscillation
(LCO) response from a small yaw angle (ﬂapping ﬂag response for β = 0) to a large
yaw angle (wing-like response, β = 90◦) of a cantilever plate as the angle between
the clamped edge and free stream velocity changes. In particular, [37] presents a
nonlinear structural model for the rotated aeroelastic system. One creates the aeroe-
lastic model by coupling this newly developed inextensible nonlinear plate struc-
tural model with a rotated vortex lattice aerodynamic model. The theoretical pre-
dictions were validated with aeroelastic experiments. Three distinct conﬁgurations,
β = 0◦, 45◦and 90◦were explored that show markedly different LCO transition
behaviors.
Table2 contains the material properties and geometry of the conﬁguration. Table3
shows the results of the ground vibration experiments in bending and torsion. The
ﬁrst column has the theoretical predictions using a ANSYS structural model with
the parameters listed in Table2. There is very good agreement between the theory
(ANSYS code) and the experiment for all of the bending and torsion modes.
The goal of the aeroelastic experiments was to quantify the LCO amplitude of the
ﬂapping ﬂag (β = 0◦) as shown in Fig. 2a. To capture the LCO amplitude, a Light
Emitting Diode, LED, was placed at the tip and mid-span of the structure. Using 3D

RPS video the path of the LED can be traced. Additionally the color coherence of the
LED light, made it easier to use automated ﬁltering in Matlab to track the path. To
determine the amplitude of the oscillation, the code averages the snapshots from a full
second of the video (30 frames) to get the average path. The script then automatically
identiﬁes the pixel of the far left and far right portion of the path and calls this the
LCO amplitude. This amplitude is then synchronized with the wind tunnel velocity
data to get the amplitude as a function of the velocity. The amplitude is converted
to a real length using the camera calibration conducted before the experiment that
calculates the pixels per centimeter in the plane of the LED. This method is able to
provide the LCO amplitude to +/−1cm. This could be improved by using a camera
with a higher resolution. For the detail experimental measurement, see Ref. [12].
The experimental data are presented as the measured nondimensional peak dis-
placement from the panel tip. Figure2b shows the nondimensional rms ﬂap amplitude
versus the ﬂow velocity. The theoretical results include two nonlinear cases: a full
stiffness nonlinearity only and a full stiffness nonlinearity plus an inertia nonlinearity.
The experimental results contain the LCO amplitude data for all of three different
runs. The theoretical LCO responses are bursts or intermittent motion while the
experimental results are primarily a single harmonic oscillation.
The experimental linear ﬂutter speed can be estimated using an extrapolation
method (this method is also used for other yaw angles), i.e. an extrapolation of LCO
response to zero amplitude. The experimental ﬂutter speed is U f = 21.35m/s and
the theoretical ﬂutter speed is U f = 20.45m/s for β = 0◦.
It is interesting that the theoretical results for the full nonlinearities (inertia plus
stiffness) agree best with experiment for the LCO amplitude. However when only

For β = 45◦and β = 90◦yawed plates, to capture the LCO amplitude, a micro-
accelerometer was placed at the trailing edge of these plate structuries. Even though
the micro-accelerometer is only 2.6g, we include this weight in the computational
model.

Figure2c, d show the computational and experimental correlations of the LCO
displacement response rms amplitude versus the ﬂow velocity for the yaw angle of
β = 45◦. The correlation between the computations and experiments is reasonably
good beyond the ﬂutter speed. There are some smaller response amplitudes at lower
ﬂow velocities (U < 15.75m/s) in the experiment. From the experimental curve
of the LCO amplitude versus the ﬂow velocity, the experimental ﬂutter speed is
U f = 15.6m/s and the theoretical ﬂutter speed is U f = 16.2m/s for β = 45◦.
For β = 90◦, the plate is a wing-like. Figure2e, f show the computational and
experimental correlations of the LCO displacement response rms amplitude and
corresponding LCO frequency versus the ﬂow velocity for the yawed angle of β =
90◦. The correlation between the computations and experiments is fair beyond the
ﬂutter speed. There are some smaller response amplitudes at lower ﬂow velocities
(U < 19m/s) in the experiment due to ﬂow turbulence. The experimental ﬂutter
speed is U f = 19.3m/s and theoretical ﬂutter speed is U f = 18.7m/s for β = 90◦.
By comparing computations and experiments for the LCO response of the several
yawed plate conﬁgurations, it is shown that the present inextensible beam or plate
theory as provided by Dowell and Tang [37] produces results in good agreement
with the measured rms LCO amplitude. These theories have only a single unknown
variable, i.e. the transverse deﬂection of the beam or plate structure. This is very
attractive for computations.

Free-to Roll Fuselage Flutter Model (Symmetric and
Anti-symmetric Flutter/LCO Theory)
A ﬂutter model is often made using a semi-span wind-tunnel model with the root
of the semi-span wing model clamped on the tunnel side wall. The experimental
data obtained from such a model is suitable for computational aeroelasticity code
validation. References [38–41] are studies with typical subsonic and transonic ﬂutter
semi-span models. The boundary conditions of these experimental ﬂutter modes are
different from those of an actual aircraft, but the experimental data from the wind
tunnel test may still be useful for evaluating the theory.
A fuselage which is free to roll is designed, but the vertical rigid body translation
(plunge) and rotation (pitch) of the fuselage are constrained.The full span wing is
a cropped delta wing plate for simplicity. The right and left wings are structurally
symmetric. The full span wing dynamics are modeled using a linear plate wing
structure theory. A three-dimensional time domain vortex lattice aerodynamic model
is also used to investigate ﬂutter of the linear aeroelastic system and results are
correlated with experiment. See Ref. [28] for more detail.
The experimental model consists of a right and left wing and a fuselage (slender
body). For simplicity, the wing model is a cropped delta wing conﬁguration which is
constructed from a aluminum plate of thickness 0.0127cm and has 40◦leading edge
sweep and 0◦trailing edge sweep. The root chord is 12.7cm and the halfspan length

Aeroelastic Models Design/Experiment and Correlation …
673
is 11.68cm. The material properties of the wing are: mass density of 0.00284kg/cm2,
Young’s modulus of 720000kg/cm2 and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3.The right and left
wing model is assumed to be rigidly clamped along the full root chord of the wing.
The total rolling inertia about the fuselage center axis for the right and left wings is
Jw = 3.859e−5 kgm2. A photograph of the aeroelastic model in the wind tunnel is
shown in Fig.3a.
The fuselage has a circular cross-section with a diameter of 2.54 cm. It includes
two parts. The front part is a slender body with a parabolic forebody which can rotate
about the fuselage center axis and supports the wings. The rear part is a non-rotating
slender body with a parabolic aftbody which is used to support the front portion of
the slender body and is connected to the wind tunnel ﬂoor by a support or sting rod.
The rolling inertia about the fuselage center axis for the rotating slender body is
J f = 11.19e−5 kgm2.
The wings are allowed to rotate (roll) about the center axis of the fuselage. The
free or clamped mechanism for the rotation is provided by an electrical magnet brake
that is used to provide rolling free or rolling clamped boundary conditions. Two strain
gauges attached near the root of the two wings are used to measure the wing elastic
deﬂections.
Because the experimental structural model has nonlinear behavior, the self-excited
aeroelastic response represents a limit cycle oscillation(LCO) when the ﬂow velocity
is higher than the linear ﬂutter speed. The linear critical ﬂutter boundary is estimated
from the LCO responses. The structural nonlinearity arises from a nonlinear strain-
displacement relationship due to large structural deformations of the plate-like wings.
Figure3b shows the measured rms LCO amplitude (microstrain) from the strain
guage at the wing root versus the ﬂow velocity from U = 14m/s to 18m/s for three
cases. One is for the symmetric mode, i.e. in the rolling ﬁxed case. The other two cases
are for the anti-symmetric mode with J f /Jw = 2.9 and 13.5. The data are acquired
whentheresponseachievesasteadystatelimitcycleoscillation.Theresponseisgiven
by a rms value over the total sampling length. For the rolling ﬁxed case, there are
very small rms amplitudes from U = 14 to 17m/s. It is believed that these responses
are induced by the randomly ﬂuctuating ﬂow of the wind tunnel. At U = 17.1m/s,
the LCO rms amplitude jumps to a high amplitude response with a certain oscillating
frequency. As the ﬂow velocity continues to increase from U = 17.1m/s, the LCO
rms amplitude increases. An intersection between the extrapolated LCO amplitude
curve and the ﬂow velocity axis is deﬁned as the linear critical ﬂutter speed. This
estimated value is aboutU f = 17.05m/s. Similar to the symmetric mode case, for the
anti-symmetric mode ﬂutter at J f /Jw = 2.9 and 13.5, the experimentally estimated
linear critical ﬂutter speeds are U f = 16.6m/s and 16.7m/s, respectively.
Figure3cshowsthetheoreticalandexperimental(estimated)criticalﬂutterbound-
ary versus J f /Jw from J f /Jw = 0 to 50. For the theoretical anti-symmetric mode
ﬂutter, the ﬂutter speed increases as J f /Jw increases but the increase is small. For
the theoretical symmetric mode ﬂutter, the ﬂutter boundary does not change with
J f /Jw as expected. When J f /Jw becomes large, the linear ﬂutter speed for the anti-
symmetric mode approaches that for the symmetric mode. The experimental results
for the anti-symmetric mode at J f /Jw = 2.9, 13.5 and 38 are plotted in this ﬁgure as

Experimental Models for Measuring Flutter/LCO
Response to Evaluate Nonlinear Freeplay Theory
The freeplay nonlinearity usually occurs in the following components of an air-
craft: (a) between the main wing and the control surface actuating mechanism; (b)
between the all-movable horizontal or vertical tail and the stabilizer or control actuat-

ing mechanism. In this section, two typical experimental models have been designed
and constructed to simulate these freeplay nonlinearities. 1. an airfoil section with
control surface freeplay and 2. all-movable tail with stabilizer freeplay.
3.1
Airfoil Section with Control Surface Freeplay
Early theoretical studies of aeroelastic systems with structural freeplay were car-
ried out on analog computers by linearizing the system about the nonlinearity via
describing functions or harmonic balance or by time marching integration based on
the state-space model. One of the compelling advantages of using harmonic balance
or describing functions for aeroelastic systems is that traditional linear analytical
tools, such as eigenanalysis, can be used for the determination of system stability
while still allowing for the prediction of some nonlinear behavior. However, the
response of a true nonlinear system may be dependent on the initial conditions, and
the describing function approach does not permit a full exploration of this effect. The
dependence on initial conditions and the wide variety of nonlinear behavior exhib-
ited by systems with freeplay show the importance of incorporating this common
physical nonlinearity into the theoretical model. In addition, the freeplay nonlinear-
ity will likely have a signiﬁcant effect on the response of the system to a control law
designed for the nominal linear system.
In the present correlation study, a new nonlinear aerodynamic model, a ﬁnite
state incompressible airloads model, developed by Peters [42] called “Duke code”
and a ZAERO code based on CFD technology and nonlinear structural dynamics
developed by ZONAT Technology, Inc [25] have been used.
3.1.1
Experimental Model and Measurement System
The two-dimensional NACA 0012 rectangular wing model includes two parts: a main
wing with a 19cm chord and 52cm span; and a ﬂap with a 6.35cm chord and 52cm
span, which is mounted at the trailing edge of the main wing using two pairs of micro-
bearing with a pin. The main wing is constructed from an aluminum alloy circular
spar beam with a diameter of 2.54cm and a wall thickness of 0.32cm. The beam
runs through 14 pieces of NACA 0012 aluminum airfoil plate and serves as the pitch
axis, located at the quarter-chord location from the leading edge. A 0.254 mm thick
aluminum sheet covers the entire chord and span, providing the aerodynamic contour
of the wing. In addition, an aluminum tube with 1.27cm diameter is mounted from
wing tip to wing tip at a location of 3.175cm from the leading edge. The chordwise
center of gravity can be adjusted by adding or subtracting a balance weight from this
tube.
The ﬂap is constructed in a similar manner with an aluminum alloy tube spar beam
(1.27cm diameter and 0.158cm wall-thickness) passed through the leading edge of
14 pieces of NACA 0012 wood airfoil plate. The ﬂap is also covered with the same

type of aluminum sheet. Figure4a shows the photograph of the experimental model
including the ground vibration test.
A rotational axis comprised of the micro-bearings and pin allows the ﬂap to have a
rotational degree of freedom relative to the main wing. A steel leaf-spring is inserted
tightly into a slot of the tube spar beam at one end of the ﬂap. The free end of the leaf
spring is inserted into a support block mounted on the main wing. The schematic
of freeplay mechanism and restoring moment with a symmetric freeplay region,
see Fig.4b. The amount of structural stiffness that the leaf-spring provides can be
adjusted by moving the support block toward or away from the rotational axis of the
ﬂap or by changing the diameter of the leaf-spring. Freeplay is incorporated by using
a support block that allows the free end of the leaf-spring to move through a given
range of motion before encountering resistance.
The support mechanisms for the entire model are mounted outside of the wind
tunnel, at the top and bottom. The support mechanism at each end is a bi-cantilever
beam made of two steel leaf-spring which are 20.32cm long, 2.86cm wide, and

Aeroelastic Models Design/Experiment and Correlation …
677
0.102cm thick. The distance between the two cantilever beams is 15.24cm. A support
block joins the free ends of the bi-cantilevered beams on both the top and the bottom
and is free to move in the plunge direction. Figure4a shows the plunging motion
of the support structure. An identical structure is located on the bottom side of the
wind tunnel. The two support blocks are the only parts of the support mechanism that
move with the model, and this motion is restricted to the plunge degree of freedom.
The pitch axis of the main wing is mounted to the upper and lower support blocks
through a pair of precision bearings which have small amount of dry friction in the
ball. This design allows the model to have a plunge motion that is independent of the
pitch degree of freedom. At the upper bracket, there is a spring wire inserted tightly
into the pitch axis of the wing. The ends of the spring wire are simply supported on
the bracket, which provides an adjustable pitch stiffness. The bracket is mounted on
the upper support mechanism by three screws. The bracket allows rotation around
the pitch axis when the screws are used to adjust the initial pitch angle.
The pitch angle of the main wing is measured by a rotational velocity displace-
ment transducer, R30, which is ﬁxed at the upper end of the pitch axis. The angular
displacement transducer was calibrated and showed excellent linear response charac-
teristic and high sensitivity. The plunge displacement is measured using another R30
which determines the motion of the upper support block. The ﬂap rotational motion
relative to the main wing is measured by a micro-RVDT which is mounted on the
ﬂap axis outside of the main wing. These three measurement signals are independent
of one another.
The output from these transducers is ampliﬁed and directly recorded by data
acquisition system, LabView 8.0 version in the computer. The digitized response data
can be graphically displayed either on-line or off-line as a time history, phase plane
plot, FFT, PSD, or Poincare map. In order to make a comparison of the theoretical
and experimental data, a measurement system calibration was completed before
the wing tunnel test. The dynamic calibration coefﬁcients were determined by a
ground vibration test. The system parameters for the experimental model are shown
in Table4.
From the experimental ground vibration results, a comparison of the structural
natural frequencies for the numerical and experimental systems is given in Table5.
3.1.2
Correlation Study α0 = 0◦
For the ﬂutter/LCO test, a freeplay gap, 2 × δ = 2 × 2.12◦, is used. A nondimen-
sional r.m.s amplitude normalized by the freeplay gap is introduced here for LCO
amplitude. The pitch and ﬂap motions are nondimensionalized by the freeplay gap,
i.e. by 2 × δ. For the plunge motion, it is nondimensionalized by 2 × πδb/180◦.
When the freeplay gap is set zero, the measured ﬂutter ﬂow velocity is 26.5m/s
for zero initial angle of attack. Because in this ﬂow velocity range the model motion
is very large we use an external device to limit the plunge motion amplitude. The
measured ﬂutter frequency is about 6.25Hz.

Figure5 shows the nondimensional plunge, pitch, ﬂap LCO amplitudes and LCO
frequency versus the ﬂow velocity for the initial pitch angle, α0 = 0. The motion
may be periodic or non-periodic or chaotic. Here we use r.m.s amplitude to present
the LCO motion versus the ﬂow velocity.
As shown Fig.5, when the ﬂow velocity, U, is less than 4.67m/s no LCO occurs
both for the theory and experiment. When U is between 4.67 and 13.26m/s for
the experiment and 4.55 and 14.1m/s for the theory, the motion is dominated by the
plunge degree of freedom and has an oscillation frequency of about 4.5–5Hz for both
the theory and experiment. When U is between 13.26 and 25.6m/s for the experiment
and 14.1 and 27.4m/s for the theory, the motion is dominated by the ﬂap degree of
freedom and has an oscillation frequency of about 10–10.5Hz for the experiment
and 9–9.5Hz for the theory. When U is greater than 25.6m/s, the experimental LCO
amplitude abruptly increases and the test is stopped to protect the model (this is called
the catastrophic ﬂutter speed). This ﬂow velocity is close to the experimental ﬂutter
speed (26.5m/s) of the linear structure without freeplay. However the theoretical
catastrophic ﬂutter speed is 27.4m/s and is slightly higher than the theoretical linear
ﬂutter speed (27.3m/s). For comparison, the computational results using CFD code,
ZAERO, provided by ZONA Technology, Inc, are also presented in this ﬁgure.

Correlation Study for α0 ̸= 0
Experimental measurement for the several initial pitch angles of attack from α0 = 2◦
to 8◦are made to study the correlation. Here only one case (α0 = 6◦) is shown
Fig.6. Summarizing the correlation results from α0 = 2◦, to α0 = 8◦, the following
observations may be made.
1. The ﬂow velocity corresponding to a change in the LCO behavior from a lower
frequency oscillation to a higher frequency oscillation changes modestly in the
experiments as α0 increases.
2. The ﬂow velocity corresponding to catastrophic ﬂutter (very large LCO ampli-
tude) also decreases as the initial pitch angle increases. The experimental results
are 25.6m/s for α0 = 0◦; 25.05m/s for α0 = 2◦; 23.96m/s for α0 = 4◦; 21.48m/s
for α0 = 6◦and 20.43m/s for α0 = 8◦.
3. When α0 equals 8◦, the ﬂow velocity range for the LCO becomes quite small and
when α0 is larger than 8◦the LCO disappears both for the theory and test.

All-Movable Tail Model with Freeplay
Experimental models have been constructed by previous investigators that had
freeplay nonlinearity in an all-movable tail in the actuating mechanism at the root,
see Ref. [43–45]. These early experiments were interpreted in terms of a reduction
in ﬂutter speed due to freeplay. However, the early works did not provide a LCO cor-
relation analysis induced by the freeplay nonlinearity. Inspired by the early WADC
(Wright Air Development Center) all-movable tail model, a similar experimental
model was designed and tested. A computational code based on the linear three-
dimensional time domain vortex lattice aerodynamic model and freeplay structural
nonlinerarity has been developed to study the ﬂutter and also nonlinear limit cycle
oscillations induced by a freeplay gap in the actuating mechanism at the root of the
tail as well as the effects of the root rotation angle (nominal angle of attack) on
LCO response. The tail model is mounted vertically in the wind tunnel. The effect
of the gravity load is not considered in the computations and experiment discussed
here although a later study included the effects of gravity by testing the model in a
horizontal mount.

A uniformly tapered wing from root to tip was designed to simulate a conventional

with free play gap in the root rotation mechanism is shown in Fig.7a. The experi-
mental model includes two parts: a tapered wing and an actuating mechanism with
torsional free play gap at the root. The tail wing is untwisted and ﬂexible in the ﬂap,
lag and torsional directions. The root chord is 24.7cm and tip chord is 13.2cm and
the span is 39.7cm. The sweep angle of the lead edge is 5.7◦.
The wing is constructed from a precision ground ﬂat steel spar with mass uni-
formly distributed along the wing span. The spar is 39.7cm in length, 1.905cm in
width and 0.127cm in thickness. It is inserted tightly into the wing root mechanism.
The spar elastic axis is located at 33% of the local chord aft of the leading edge which
is consistent with the location for the axis of rotation of the tail, see Fig.7b
There are 14 pieces of 2.6cm wide sections uniformly attached to the spar along
the span. Each section consists of a pair of ribs with NACA 0012 airfoil plate made of
plastic material with 0.15cm thickness. Each airfoil plate is fabricated using a Laser
Printer and CAD software. Each airfoil section is constructed from two plastic airfoil
plates and balsa wood. The wing is assembled by inserting the steel spar through
a small slot cut through each of the sections. An additional 0.2cm thick sheet of
balsa wood is placed between each section and the wing is permanently bonded. The
balsa wood placed between the airfoil sections provides some additional mass and
stiffness in the bending and in torsion.
The support mechanism for the entire tail model is mounted outside of the wind
tunnel at the top. The wing spar axis is mounted to support blocks through a pair of
precision bearings which have a small amount of dry friction in the ball, but this dry
friction is not accounted for in the computational code. There is a spring wire inserted
tightly into a rotational axis between two bearings. The free end of the spring wire is
simply supported on a bracket of the support block. The amount of rotational stiffness
that the spring wire provides can be adjusted by moving the support block toward
or away from the rotational axis of the wing. Each freeplay gap is incorporated by
using a support block with a different size hole that allows the free end of the spring
wire to move through a given range of motion before encountering resistance. A
photograph of the spring wire assembly for the rotation stiffness (with freeplay) is
shown in Fig.7c. The bracket is mounted on the support mechanism by screws. The
bracket allows rotation around the pitch axis when the screws are used to adjust the
nominal pitch angle.
The root pitch angle of the wing is measured by a rotational velocity displacement
transducer, R30, which is ﬁxed at free end of the support block. The angular displace-
ment transducer was calibrated and showed excellent linear response characteristic
and high sensitivity. A 45◦oriented strain gage for torsional modes were glued to
the root spar to measure the torsional elastic deﬂections of the tail. Signals from
the strain gages were conditioned and ampliﬁed before their measurement through
a gage conditioner and a low-pass ﬁlter. A micro-accelerometer is mounted at the

tip-span of the tail. The output signals from these transducers are directly recorded
on a computer with data-acquisition and analysis software, Lab-VIEW 7.1.
A ground vibration test of the model was used to determine the natural frequencies
and the modal damping. Figure7d shows the theoretical and experimental natural
frequencies at zero airspeed versus the uncoupled rotation frequency, ωφ. The ﬁrst
mode is dominated by the ﬁrst bending and the second is dominated by the ﬁrst
torsion. The third mode is dominated by the second bending. When the tail wing
is cantilevered, ωφ = ∞, the ﬁrst two theoretical bending frequencies 3.99, 23.1Hz
and the ﬁrst torsion frequency is 30.2Hz. The experimental results are 4.0, 25.1 for
bending and 27.75Hz for torsion. In this case the agreement between the theory and
experiment is good. Also it is found that the frequencies are close to the corresponding
ωφ = ∞values (as shown in Fig.7d) over the higher ωφ range. This means the
coupling between the bending and torsion modes is weak.
3.2.2
LCO Correlation Study for α0 = 0◦
Four typical freeplay gaps are selected. These are δ = 0.1◦, 0.25◦, 0.5◦and 1◦. The
militaryspeciﬁcation(MIL-SPEC)conﬁnesthefreeplaylimitofall-moveablecontrol
surfaces to be less than 0.034◦(peak-to peak value) to achieve the goal of no freeplay
induced LCO during normal operation of aircraft. In the present study, the maximum
freeplay gap is limited to ±1◦. The uncoupled rotation frequency, ωφ, is chosen to
be 7.5Hz, corresponding to root rotation stiffness, ks = 2.895N-m. Considering the
effects of ﬂight loads on tail freeplay induced LCO, the initial angles of attack vary
from α0 = 0◦to 6◦. The purpose of these computations is to determine the nominal
angles of attack for which when the freeplay induced LCO disappears.
Depending on the initial conditions and physical parameters, the response may be
either LCOs or chaotic oscillations, i.e. the oscillation is generally around one of two
equilibrium positions (±δ), and the particular equilibrium position depends upon
the initial conditions. Thus the oscillating displacement is essentially random with
respect to time. In this study, we used a velocity response for the bending motion and
a torsional rate for the torsional motion to present the LCO response behavior. A rms
amplitude for the bending displacement velocity at the tail tip and a rms amplitude
for the rotation angle at the root are calculated.
Figure8a and b show the rms LCO amplitude of the bending velocity and at the
tail tip (a) and the rms LCO amplitude of the root rotational angle motion (b) versus
the ﬂow velocity for the initial disturbance angle, +δ at the root. The ﬂow velocity
range is from 0 to 22m/s. Note that the linear ﬂutter speed without freeplay is 23m/s.
In these ﬁgures results are included for four freeplay gaps, δ = 0.1◦, 0.25◦, 0.5◦and
1◦. From Fig.8, the following observations may be made.

Summarizing the theoretical and experimental results for α0 = 1◦to 8◦, a dis-
appearance of the LCO boundary is listed in Table6. Note that the values in the
parenthesis show the results from the tests. Also as the nominal angles of attack
increases from 1◦to 8◦, the following observations may be made.
(1). The ﬂow velocity for LCO disappearing increases when the angle of attack
decreases for a given freeplay gap.
(2). The freeplay boundary for LCO disappearing increases when the angle of
attack increases for a given ﬂow velocity.
(3). As expected the LCO rms amplitude for both the bending and torsional
responses increases with increased freeplay gaps. These results are similar to those
for α0 = 0◦.
(4). Note that LCO also disappears for ﬂow velocities less than about 6.5m/s
which is attributed again to the presence of friction in the root support mechanism.
The quantitative agreement between the theory and experiment is reasonably
good for zero and non-zero angles of attack. The fair to good quantitative agree-
ment between theory and experiment veriﬁes that the present method has reasonable
accuracy and good computational efﬁciency for the ﬂutter/LCO analysis.

Experimental Models for Measuring Aerodynamic
Response Phenomenon in Buffeting Flow
In earlier computational work by Raveh and Dowell, Ref. [46, 47], large shock
oscillations (buffet oscillations) are observed for a certain combination of Mach
number and steady mean angle of attack even in the absence of structural motion.
Also in lower Reynolds number ﬂow, bluff bodies in cross ﬂow [48], and a ﬂat plate at
high angles of attack [49] are observed to have the nonlinear oscillations induced by
the buffeting ﬂow. In the buffeting ﬂow there is a very interesting phenomenon called
“frequency Lock-in”. Under certain ﬂow conditions, the shedding frequency can
lock into the natural frequency of the structure. In this Lock-in region, the structural

686
D. Tang and E. H. Dowell
response amplitude can reach a limit cycle oscillation that may cause high cycle
fatigue and eventually failure.
Two experimental models were constructed to observe the buffeting ﬂow oscil-
lation. One is to ﬁnd lock-in region by measuring the pressure variation on the
oscillating airfoil surface at high angles of attack. Another is to construct a partial-
span control surface (ﬂap) attached to near the mid-span of a NACA0012 airfoil
model with and without freeplay gaps at high angle of attack and to measure the ﬂap
response induced by the buffeting ﬂow.
4.1
An Oscillating Airfoil Section Model in Buffeting Flow
4.1.1
Experimental Model and Measurement System
In order to observe the dynamic and static pressure distribution and measure the
aerodynamic loading due to a high nominal angle of attack and a small pitching
oscillation through wind tunnel tests, a typical section wing model was constructed.
Design of the typical section took into account the fact that it must accommodate
a root pitching oscillation, mount 20 micro-pressure sensors, PCB model 103B01,
for dynamic pressure measurement and 20 oriﬁces for the static pressure taps at the
mid-span and also be mounted in the Duke University wind tunnel using an existing
pitch oscillating testing rig.
The proﬁle of the typical section is a NACA 0012 symmetrical airfoil, having a
chord length of 0.2554 m, which nicely accommodates 20 dynamic pressure sensors
and 20 static pressure taps. The span, l = 0.52m of the typical section was dictated
by the height of the wind tunnel, as the typical section is to be mounted vertically.
Eight pieces of NACA0012 airfoil ribs made of aluminum material with 0.64cm
thickness are used for high chordwise stiffness and for adequate housing for bearings
supporting the small strip hinge. In addition,a mid-span aluminum rib with 1.27cm
thickness provides support for 20 pressure sensors, see Fig.9a. The airfoil ribs are
placed on three spars that, in addition to being structural elements, have speciﬁc
functional roles.The spar placed at the quarter chord is an aluminum tube and serves
to mount the model on the testing rig that is connected to a pitch oscillating testing
rig to create an airfoil pitch oscillation.
The mid-span airfoil rib is specially made to measure the dynamic pressure dis-
tribution at mid-span and provide support for the 20 micro-pressure sensors. There
are 20 oriﬁces of 1.16 mm diameter for the pressure taps which are symmetrically
distributedover the upper and lower surfaces, respectively. The oriﬁce positions in
terms of percentage chord from the leading edge are 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, 0.3, 0.42, 0.49,
0.54, 0.61,0.74 and 0.92. The pressure sensor is bolted on the mid-span airfoil rib and
installed with an adhesive mounting ring to prevent a pressure leak between the pres-
sure surface of the sensor and the airfoil oriﬁce.The dimensions of the pressure sensor
are 9.5 mm diameter, 7 mm height. The weight is 3.26 g. The signal/noise is 60db,
i.e. the uncertainty is 0.1%. The dynamic range is 77db and the frequency range

Fig.9a. All the structural elements are held together by epoxy resin and mechanical
elements (bolts, pins etc). They are covered with 0.25 mm in thick aluminum foil
(called skin).
The root airfoil pitch excitation was performed by a pitch oscillatory shake table
which is mounted to a very heavy support frame that is attached to the ground. The
shake table is driven using a DC servo motor through a cam.The driving frequency is
controlled by a D/A NB-MIO-16 system. A nearly pure single harmonic excitation
is provided. A photograph of the wind tunnel model and the pressure measurement
system in the model is shown in Fig.9b.
For the dynamic pressure measurement, the output of each pressure sensor and
pitch oscillating displacement was directly recorded on a PC computer through signal
conditioners, PCB models481A02, 442C04 and a data acquisition package which

consisted of a 20-channel analog to digital (A/D) plug-in interface board, a BNC
termination box,and data acquisition and analysis software, LabVIEW version 9.0.
4.1.2
Correlation Analyses for Frequency Lock-in Region
In this section, for comparison with the experimental results, the computational ﬂuid
dynamic analyses of NACA0012 are conducted using a nonlinear, frequency domain,
harmonic balance (HB) code [50]. The viscous, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes
equations are solved for a 2D slice using a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. The
O-grid contains 385 points in the circumferential direction, 97 points in the radial
direction and extent approximatery 20 diameters from the airfoil.
Aerodynamic response at buffet ﬂow conditions with no pitch excitation were
measured for different ﬂow velocities from U = 5m/s to 27.5m/s and several nominal
angles of attack, α = 30◦to 60◦. The results are shown in Fig.9c in a plot of buffeting
frequency versus ﬂow velocity and corresponding Reynolds number for the “onset”
boundary of the buffet ﬂow.
For aerodynamic response to pitch exciton in the buffeting ﬂow, a pitch sinusoidal
excitation at the airfoil root is added. The pitch excitation amplitudes, θ0, are con-
sidered in the present experiment from θ0 = 0.8◦to 3.4◦. The excitation frequency,
fe (ωe = 2π fe) varies from 5 to 12.5Hz for the nominal angle of attack, α = 40◦
and the ﬂow velocity, U = 5.8m/s and Reynolds number Re = 100,000.
Figure9d shows the experimental lock-in region found by enforcing the airfoil
oscillations at a ﬁxed amplitude and frequency. The non-dimensionalized frequency
is deﬁned as fe/fb. The angle of attack is 40◦and the Reynolds number is 100000
(U = 5.8m/s). Figure9d and other comparable data may be found in Besem et al.
[51]. The diamond symbols represent conditions where the shedding and enforced
frequencies are unlocked, the circle symbols show lockin conditions, and the square
symbols have a chaotic behavior that can be attributed to the edge of the lock-in
region. The “V” shape is similar to the numerical results conducted by HB code
[50], though the lock-in region is narrower numerically, which can be attributed
to the chaotic behavior on the edges of the lock-in region. In the experiments, it is
difﬁcult to separate the frequencies due to the motion and due to the shedding because
of the noise in the measurements. However, the computational code solution will only
converge if the two frequencies are perfectly Locked-in. This explains why the edges
of the Lock-in region are difﬁcult to compare with the experiments.
From Fig.9c and 9d the following observations may be made.
(1). The buffeting frequency is almost directly proportional to the ﬂow velocity
or Reynolds number for any nominal angle of attack.
(2). The buffeting frequency (the starting points of the curves) depends on a
combination of nominal angle of attack and ﬂow velocity or Reynolds number.
(3). As the nominal angle of attack increases the buffeting frequency decreases
for a certain ﬂow velocity or Reynolds number.

An Airfoil with and without Freeplay Control Surface in
Buffeting Flow
4.2.1
Experimental Model and Measurement System
The airfoil experimental model and the pressure measurement system are the same
as described above. This model is mounted vertically to a very heavy support frame
that allows one to adjust the nominal angle of attack of this model. The rotation
center is at the one quarter chord of the airfoil. A photograph of the experimental
model is shown in Fig.10a.
Based on the above model, a partial span control surface (ﬂap) with 5.08cm chord
and 5.08cm span is mounted on the wing model at span location, y = 28cm and
chord location of x = 20cm. The ﬂap pitch rotation axis is placed at x = 20cm.
The rotation axis is comprised of two micro-bearings and allows the ﬂap to have a
rotational degree of freedom relative to the main wing. A steel leaf-spring is inserted
tightly into a slot of the rotation axis of the ﬂap.The free end of the leaf-spring is
inserted into a support block mounted on the main wing. The amount of structural
stiffness that the leaf-spring provides can be adjusted by moving the support block
toward or away from the rotational axis. Freeplay is incorporated by using a support
block that allows the free end of the leaf-spring to move through a given range of
motion before encountering resistance. A schematic of the leaf spring assembly for
the partial control surface (with freeplay) is shown in Fig.10b.
Two strain gauges are glued to both sides near the ﬁxed end of the leaf-spring
and are used to measure the ﬂap pitch angle. The pitch angle calibration has been
made from the strain gages. There is almost a linear relationship between the output
voltage and the input pitch angle within 15◦. The average sensitive coefﬁcient is
1.115 degree/voltage. For the dynamic pressure and ﬂap pitch angle measurements,
the output of each pressure sensor and pitch angle were directly recorded on a PC
computer through signal conditioners and a data acquisition package which consisted
of a 20-channel analog to digital (A/D) plug-in interface board, a BNC termination
box, and data acquisition and analysis software, LabVIEW version 9.0.
Because of unavoidable freestream and boundary layer turbulence irregularities,
the free stream turbulence levels are about 1% of the nominal velocity. In order to
remove this randomness from the pressure data, an ensemble averaging procedure
over a total of 20 records was carried out. The response is given by a rms value over
the total sampling length for the experimental data. For the FFT analysis of these
experimental data, an ensemble averaged FFT analysis has been used. Twenty (20)
test time samples are taken to do the FFT analysis and an averaged FFT amplitude
and frequency are determined.

Measured Aeroelastic Response of the Flap Induced by Buffeting

The experimental ﬂap pitch stiffness is kp = 0.0569Nm/rad and the ﬂap pitch
moment of inertia is Jp = 0.42155E−5 kgm2 and the corresponding ﬂap pitch nat-
ural frequency is f p = 18.25Hz. All aeroelastic ﬂap response tests were performed
for nominal angles of attack from α0 = 30◦to 50◦and the ﬂow velocity varies from
5m/s to 26m/s. Four freeplay gap ranges are considered in the wind tunnel tests,
δ = ±0.25◦, ±0.5◦, ±0.75◦and ±1.0◦.

Figure10c shows ﬂap rms pitch amplitude versus the buffeting frequency, for the
nominal angles of attack α0 = 30◦to 50◦without freeplay gap. There is a local peak
amplitude for each nominal angle of attack. Corresponding to these peak amplitudes,
the ﬂap is excited by a larger aerodynamic load with a certain excitation frequency,
i.e the buffet frequency, fb.1 At the peak response values, the buffeting frequencies
are close to the ﬂap natural frequency, f p. We use a dotted line to connect these peak
points in this ﬁgure. The rms dynamic ﬂap responses are created by two different
types of ﬂow separation: one is due to a randomly ﬂuctuating ﬂow as shown for
α0 < 28◦and the other is due to a von Karman street vortex ﬂow that has a dominant
frequency when α0 > 30◦. The ﬂuctuating ﬂow has a white noise characteristic and
the noise strength increases as the ﬂow velocity increases. This noise excitation
always leads to an increase in rms ﬂap amplitude with increased ﬂow velocity, but
the von Karman street vortex ﬂow or buffeting ﬂow signiﬁcantly increases the rms
ﬂap amplitude when the buffeting frequency is close to the ﬂap natural frequency.
Generally, the rms ﬂap response amplitude increases as the nominal angle of attack
increases. For example, when α0 = 30◦, the buffet ﬂow strength, i.e the peak value at
the buffeting frequency, is relatively weak. Indeed, for the range of 28◦< α0 < 30◦
it is difﬁcult to identify the dominant buffeting frequency from the measured ﬂap
response due to the weak buffeting ﬂow. When α0 > 40◦the buffet ﬂow strength is
stronger and the effect on the ﬂap response is signiﬁcant.
The dynamic rms amplitude of the ﬂap pitch angle versus the ﬂow velocity for four
freeplay gaps at nominal angle of attack, α0 = 40◦is shown in Fig.10d. The dynamic
rms amplitude does not increase monotonically with an increased ﬂow velocity.
There is a local peak amplitude for each freeplay gap. Corresponding to these peak
amplitudes, the ﬂap is excited by a larger aerodynamic load with a buffeting ﬂow
frequency, fb and these buffeting frequencies are close to the ﬂap natural frequency,
f p. Corresponding to the peak amplitude, the ﬂow velocity, Up−p = 13.1m/s and
frequency fb = 18.5Hz for no freeplay gap. The Up−p values for different freeplay
gaps are also very close to U = 13.1m/s. The corresponding f p−p values for different
freeplay gaps are very close to the buffeting frequency, fb. It is interesting to note
that the peak rms amplitude for different freeplay gaps are also close to the value for
no freeplay case. This means the effect of the freeplay gap on the dynamic response
of the ﬂap motion is small.
Due to the larger static preload of the aerodynamic forces, the ﬂap pitch motion
is always near to one side of the freeplay boundary. The ﬂow buffeting frequency
versus the ﬂow velocity can be determined from measured ﬂap motion. The results
show that the ﬂow buffeting frequency is almost independent of the freeplay gaps,
as expected.
The buffet ﬂow occurs at large angles of attack and leads to a larger preload
due to the aerodynamic forces and thus a larger static pitch equilibrium position. In
this case no limit cycle oscillations (LCO) of the ﬂap pitch motion induced by the
freeplay gap were found. The ﬂap pitch motions are around the upper boundary of

In recent years, various mechanisms for creating an oscillating ﬂow in a wind tunnel
have been developed for the purpose of studying the response of linear and nonlinear
structural modes to gust excitation. These methods include oscillating biplane vanes
mounted on the side walls of the test section entrance [52], a cascade of oscillating
airfoils [53], ﬁxed airfoils with oscillating ﬂaps [54], ﬁxed airfoils with oscillating
jet ﬂaps [55] and airfoils with circulation control [56]. These conventional gust
generators require mechanical complexity to achieve the required sinusoidal lateral
and longitudinal gust amplitude over a useful frequency range. Thus, there is a need
for a new concept for a gust generator with a high degree of mechanical simplicity,
controllability and reliability. A ﬂight ﬂutter excitation system invented by Reed
[57] has been employed successfully in aircraft aeroelastic response investigations.
This excitation system has a very simple conﬁguration and can produce high-force
aerodynamic excitation with minimal power and torque input.

Structural Design of RSC Gust Generator and
Measurement of Gust Angles
5.1.1
Structural Design of RSC Gust Generator
The design of the new gust generator is similar to that of two parallel airfoils with
circulation control or oscillating jet ﬂaps. The latter needs an air supply source and
a more complex airfoil conﬁguration to control the circutation or jet, and thus, the
gust magnitude. The former uses the local inﬂow airstream as an energy source.
The gust generator can induce a controlled gust ﬁeld in the test section by means
of a ﬁxed airfoil with a rotating slotted cylinder (RSC) at its trailing edge. Here the
lateral and longitudinal gust intensities are controlled by the RSC. The extremely
simple RSC/airfoil system combined with low cost is a major advantage of this gust
system. A gust generator based on the previous ﬂight ﬂutter excitation system was
designed by Dynamic Engineering Incorporated and made and installed by the Duke
aeroelastic group in the Duke University low speed wind tunnel.
The structural design of gust generator can be used to create a lateral gust or a
longitudinal gust that depends on RSC rotation direction. If two parallel RSC/airfoils
have the same rotating direction, it creates lateral gust else is longitudinal gust. Here
the structural design for lateral gust generator is described below.

The basic design of the gust generator consists of an aluminum frame as a drive
support system that is inserted at the bottom near the test section entrance of the wind
tunnel. The frame holds two SRC/airfoils and also a motor drive system. The photo-
graph of the gust generator is shown in Fig.11a. Each RSC/airfoil is a symmetrical
airfoil with a 2.54cm diam. RSC located at the trailing edge. The RSC/airﬁl is sim-
ply constructed using a ﬁne-grain wood over an aluminum spar, with a chord length
of 10.16cm, spar length of 52.6cm and a NACA 0015 airfoil proﬁle. The distance
between adjacent RSC/airfoil is 30.5cm. The cylinder is made from an aluminum
tube with an o.d. of 2.54cm and thickness of 0.32cm. The slot is symmetrical with
a 45◦center angle. The slot is divided into two spanwise segments, supported by
an intermediate ring with a diameter of 2.54cm and a width of 0.25cm. The gap
between the o.d. of RSC and the trailing edge of the airfoil is 0.32cm. A photograph
of the RSC/airfoil is shown in Fig.11c.
The RSC has two tip bearings that are centrally mounted on the ceiling plate of the
wind tunnel and the bottom plate of the frame. The frame is mounted to a very heavy
support table that is attached to the ground. A photograph of the frame is shown in
Fig.11d. The frame is 15.24cm in width and 10.16cm tall.
Rotation of the RSC is provided by a DC servomotor DM-326. The interface
between the motor and cylinder is located on the lower part of the frame through a
motor drive system of timing belts and lightweight pulleys.
There are two modes of gust excitation considered in this generator: sine dwell
with a single frequency and linear frequency sweep. These are controlled by a Mac-
intosh II-Ci personal computer. The control program is included so that the experi-
mentalist can stop the frequency sweep and dwell at any frequency during the test
run.
5.1.2
Gust Flowﬁeld Measurement
The lateral velocity w (or hence, αg, which is equal to w/U ), was measured with
a differential pressure probe mounted on a bar that is located a certain position in the
gust ﬂowﬁeld. The bar was attached to a stand ﬁxed on a support table that can be
adjusted to any position.
The pressure probe consisted of two tubes or claws, oriented at 90◦to one another
in the horizontal plane for measuring the lateral gust and a pitot tube at the center
of the probe for measuring the longitudinal gust. The photograph of probe is shown
in Fig.11b. The ends of the tubes protrude from a slender aerodynamic housing,
which is oriented in the wind tunnel such that the angle between the tubes is bisected
by the freesteam. The tubes are connected to two ±0.1804-psi differential pressure
transducers with a high level voltage output, which is located ourside of the wind
tunnel and measures the pressure difference in the lateral direction. The conﬁguration
of this probe is similar to a yaw meter of the ﬁve-hole probe. For the principle of
the gust ﬂowﬁeld measurement, see Ref. [58]. The relationship between the output
voltage from the differential pressure transducers and lateral gust angle was obtained
by using a statical or a dynamical calibration.

5.2
Veriﬁcation of Design Principle of RSC Gust Generator
The design principle is based on Biot–Savart law of the aerodynamic theory. The
lift generated by each RSC/airfoil can be considered as a linear segment vortex of
a circulation located at the quarter chord of the combinated RSC/airfoil. A static
equivalent lift coefﬁcient from both a numerical computation and an experiment
study can be used to verify the design principle of gust generator and obtain an
optimal design of this gust generator. The equivalent lift coefﬁcient is deﬁned as
CLeq = 2(Lair f oil + Lrsc)/[ρU 2(c + d)]
where Lair f oil is airfoil lift force per span length and Lrsc is RSC lift force per span
length, c and d is airfoil chord length and cylinder diameter.

5.2.1
Experimentally Measured Lift Forces of Arfoil and RSC
The experimental model and measurement technique are described below.
A two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil model measuring 30.48cm in chord and
53.3cm in span was mounted vertically across the test section from the tunnel ﬂoor.
The airfoil is set at zero angle of attack. A gap of approximately 0.16cm existed
between the ends of the model and the wind tunnel walls. There are 35 oriﬁces
0.12cm in diameter used for pressure taps that are symmetrically distributed over the
upper and lower surfaces of the midspan, respectively. These oriﬁces are connected
to a scanivalve system, a standard static pressure measurement system in the wind
tunnel.
The RSC is made by using a special manufacturing technique. The cylinder itself
is made from a special tube with an o.d. of 7.62cm and thickness of 0.95cm. The
slot is symmetrical with a 45◦center angle. A top plate with a thickness of 0.635cm
is mounted on the top end of the RSC and a root bracket ﬁxed on the bottom end of
RSC that is connected to a rotating support of a wind tunnel balance. The RSC is
mounted vertically and cantilevered from the rotating support behind the airfoil. The
gap between the top of RSC and the ceiling of tunnel is 0.16cm. The gap between
the o.d. of the RSC and the trailing edge of airfoil can be adjusted by moving the
airfoil root support.
The RSC is statically rotated from 0◦to 180◦and then the pressure distribution on
the airfoil surface and the lift force, Lair f oil, of the RSC are measured. The output of
the measured static pressure through the scanivalve system was directly recorded on
a Macintosh IIci computer through a data acquisition package. NB-MIO-16 board
and an analysis software, LabVIEW 2. The wind tunnel balance with a readout
instrument was used to measure directly the lift force, Lrsc, of the RSC system. A
rotating controller was used to control the rotational angle of the RSC from 0◦to
180◦.
5.2.2
Correlation Between Experiment and Numerical Simulation
Based on the experimental model, the ﬂowﬁeld around a combinated RSC/airfoil is
numerically simulated using the general purpose ﬁnite element program FIDAP. The
ﬂow is assumed to be quasisteady, turbulent, incompressible and two dimensional.
The turbulence is modeled far from the walls by a high Reynolds number κ −ϵ
model. In the near wall region, which includes the viscous sublayer, the mixing
length concept is used to model turbulence. The variation of lift as a function of the
rotation angle and as a function of the gap between the airfoil and RSC is calculated.
Three typical RSC/airfoil gaps are selected in the experiment and computation. A
nondimensional gap, ¯e is normalized by the airfoil chord length. There are ¯e = 0.03,
0.08 and 0.3. The ﬂow velocity is U = 20m/s. A typical theoretical and experimental
equivalent lift coefﬁcients CLeq versus statically rotational angle of RSC is shown in
Fig.12a for nondimensional gap ¯e = 0.08 and U = 20m/s. From the FFT analysis
of these data, the theoretical and experimental equivalent lift coefﬁcient are 0.31 and

696
D. Tang and E. H. Dowell
0.39, respectively, for the dominant periodic component. The maximum lift response
is located at a rotational angle, φs = 20◦and the minimum lift response is located
at φs = 70◦. At φs = 45◦and φs = 135◦the lift response are zero. These results are
physically plausible due to the RSC symmetry at a zero lift position. The agreement
between theory and experiment is good.
The purpose of these test and computation is not only to do veriﬁcation of design
principle of RSC gust generator, but also to observe the variation of the lift coefﬁcient
induced by rotating the RSC and the effects of the RSC position. As shown in
Fig.12b and c, it is found that the lift coefﬁcient decreases as the gap value increases.
It is believed that the lift coefﬁcient should be zero when the gap value is large
enough. Also note that the differences between the experimental and the numerically
simulated lift coefﬁcients increases as the gap decreases.
For more details of the experimental measurements and numerical simulation
method see Refs. [59, 60].

Gust Responses for High-Aspect-Ratio Wing
Theoretical and experimental correlation analyses of the static aeroelastic response,
ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations have been discussed in the Sect.2.1. The exper-
imental wing model and experimental measured system are also described in this
Sect.2.1 and also used in this gust response correlation analysis. The goal of this
section is to assess experimentally the theoretical correlation of gust responses to
a single harmonic and sweep frequency gust excitations using nonlinear structural
beam theory and linear gust aerodynamic theories. The experimental model is verti-
cally mounted on the ceiling of the wind tunnel and behind the RSC gust generator
that is described above. A photograph of the experimental model and gust generator
in the wind tunnel is shown Fig.13. Dur to the wing is in the vertical status, the
effects of wing gravity is neglected in the correlation study.
5.3.1
Responses to A Single Harmonic Gust Excitation
In order to obtain a more meaningful correlation between theory and experiment, the
gust angles of attack for a single harmonic are measured and quantitatively calibrated.
A typical time history and corresponding FFT analysis of the gust angle of attack
are shown in Fig.14a and b for U = 25m/s and gust frequency ω = 18.5Hz. As
shown in the FFT analysis of Fig.14b, the gust load is not a pure sinusoid. The
second harmonic component is small however. Similar results are found for other
gust frequencies. Figure14c shows the measured gust angle of attack (αG) versus gust
excitation frequency (Hz) for a ﬂow velocity of U = 25m/s. In this ﬁgure, a symbol,
◦, indicates the measured ﬁrst harmonic component and the symbol, •, indicates
the second harmonic component. The solid line is a least-square curve ﬁtting of the
experimental data. A formula based upon the measured experimental gust angle of
attack is constructed as

where φ is a possible phase difference between ﬁrst and second gust frequencies.
However, it is difﬁcult to determine φ due to the ﬂow ﬁeld created by the present
RSC gust generator. Thus we assume φ = 0 as an approximation in the theoretical
computations.
Using experimental gust angle versus gust frequency (Fig.14c), the correlation
analyses between the theoretical and experimental results for the mid-span velocity
response (rms) versus gust excitation frequency at the ﬂow velocity U = 25m/s is

near 22–23Hz, which corresponds to the ﬁrst torsional mode. The theoretical and
experimental results verify that the correlation is good.
5.3.2
Responses to A Frequency Sweep Gust Excitation
Before the test, the frequency sweep gust excitation values are measured and quan-
titatively calibrated. The measured point of the probe is located at the position of
the wing model. Figure15a shows a measured time of continuous linear frequency
sweep gust angle of attack for U = 25m/s. The gust strength (angle of attack) is
not constant with time as expected from theory. For the measured lateral gust, the
minimum and maximum frequencies are 0 and 40Hz, and the sweep duration T is
4s. For convenient application in the gust response analysis, a formula based upon
experimental gust angle of attack data is constructed,

and experiment is reasonably good. The peak frequencies of the PSD analysis are
very similar to Fig.14d. It further conﬁrms our previous conclusions for the single
harmonic excitation.
In addition to the high-aspect-ratio wing model [3], studies of gust response for
other linear and nonlinear structural models have been made. These are:
1. A ﬂexibly suspended high-aspect-ratio wing model [4];
2. A delta wing model [17, 18];
3. A wing-store model including a freeplay in the store support [19];
4. An airfoil section wing control surface freeplay [22, 23];
5. An airfoil with electro-magnetic dry friction damper [24];
6. An All-movable tail model including a freeplay in the control system [26].

Modeling of aero-electromechanical interaction in active ﬂutter suppression and
in energy harvesting extraction from a large nonlinear aeroelastic response has been
studiedanddevelopedtheoreticallyandexperimentallyintheDukeAeroelasticgroup
[63–65]. For the former, two typical example systems, a typical section model and
a ﬂexible delta wing have been described by David Cox in chapter “Aeroelastic
Control”. For the energy harvesting project, the inextensible beam and plate theory

702
D. Tang and E. H. Dowell
developed by this group has provided a strong theoretical foundation. This theoret-
ical approach has been applied to nonlinear aeroelastic response analysis and aero-
electromechanical coupling model analysis and also correlated with results from
wind tunnel experiments.
The studies of energy harvesting include experimentally aeroelastic model design
with partly and fully covered piezoelectric and piezo ﬁlm sensor attached to a beam
or plate, experimentally electromechanical model design and power energy measure-
ment from large structural response and also the theoretical and experimental corre-
lation both for the ﬂapping response from wind tunnel testing and energy harvesting.
Theoretically, the structural dynamic equation includes the effects of the mass and
stiffness of piezoelectric sheets and the stiffness nonlinearity form inextensible beam
and plate theory. Also the linear electric equation includes these nonlinear terms from
the above effects. To ﬁnd a optimal energy extraction, the fully covered piezoelectric
plate is rotated from a position with the clamped edge normal to the ﬂow (0◦) to where
the clamped edge is aligned with the ﬂow (90◦), i,e the yaw angle, β varies from
0◦to 180◦. Thus, this numerical simulation provides a better option of the yawed
plate. Two cases of the theoretical and experimental correlation are considered. One
is an experiment for a large ﬂapping response created by an external force vibration
excitation near the second bending natural frequency. This experiment not only eval-
uates the theoretical aero-electromechanical coupling model, but also the nonlinear
inextensible beam theory when the electric circuit is closed. Another experiment is
for a large ﬂapping response created by a limit cycle oscillation of a ﬂuttering ﬂag
providing an aeroelastic energy harvester created for piezoelectric power genera-
tion in an aerodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld. AC voltage outputs from the piezo patch or ﬁlm
sensors and a DC power extraction through a AC/DC convert circuit are obtained.
These experiments are used to evaluate a new computational model and code for an
aero-electromechanical system. These provide a good physical understanding of the
ﬂutter/LCO and the energy harvester characteristics of this aero-electromechanical
system.
There are several alternative strategies for energy harvesting including energy
harvesting from ﬂuid-structural interaction. Based upon the present and prior work
the following may stated with some conﬁdence. Self excited nonlinear oscillations
arising from the dynamic instability of the corresponding linear ﬂuid-structural sys-
tem will provide larger energy/power levels than alternative concepts based upon
stable dynamical systems excited into resonance. Most of the concepts previously
studied in the literature lead to milliwatts of power typically, with a few that might
reach a watt. As shown in Ref. [64] by the numerical simulation for a comparable
sized system, the tens of watts can be theoretically achieved and scaling laws have
been developed that allow one to to increase power levels to even greater levels
with systems of greater size and improved piezoelectric patches with larger coupling
coefﬁcient.

Experimental Model for Partly Covered Piezoelectric Patch and
Piezo Film Sensors
A 6061-T6 aluminum elastic plate was used as a substrate lamination. One end was
clamped to a heavy support that was ﬁxed on the ground and the other end is free.
The length, width and thickness are 513, 101.6 and 0.375 (mm) of the substrate plate
and the mass density and elastic modulus are 2840kg/m3 and 68.9GPa. Two kinds of
piezoelectric patches, P-876A12 and piezo ﬁlm sensors, DT2-028K/L, DT4-028K/L
were bonded to the substrate on both surfaces or only on one surface. A schematic

Fig.17a. The material properties and geometry of the substrate laminate and the
piezoelectric patches and piezo ﬁlm sensors are shown in Table7.

LCO aeroelastic response and energy harvesting from the wind tunnel test.
The cantilevered plate is placed inside the wind tunnel, with aluminum proﬁle cov-
ered with 3d printed plastic shroud to reduce vortex shedding. Air speed is measured
with a pitot tube sensor and acquired directly together with tip acceleration and volt-
age outputs in the DAQ unit. The air speed is increased manually with data recorded
constantly during the tests. The tip deﬂection was measured with an accelerome-
ter and the defection inferred from that. Given a dominant single frequency in the
response, this is straightforward. A photograph of the aeroelastic model (fully cov-
ered model) in the wind tunnel is shown in Fig.17b.

Dynamic Response and Power Extraction from Force Vibration
for Partly Covered Beam Model
Figure18a shows the stiffness and mass per length distribution for the partly covered
piezoelectric patch and piezo ﬁlm sensors. The piezoelectric patch of P-876A12
provides a large additional stiffness and mass near the root of the cantilever beam.
However the piezo ﬁlm sensors of DT2-028 K/L and DT4-028K/L provide very small
additional stiffness and mass. The weight of the accelerometers is accounted for in
the computational model. The weight of the wires was added as distributed mass in
the model. A ﬁnite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The ﬁrst ﬁve (5) natural frequencies of the beam are 1.74, 8.67, 22.85,
45.53 and 73.73Hz.
A standard hammer test was performed in order to identify the dynamic properties
of the experimental model. The ﬁrst two natural frequencies are 1.23 and 8.6Hz.
An experimental model to be subjected to a dynamic loading was constructed. A
periodic dynamic point force, f0 sin(ωt)δ(x f −L) is applied near the root of the
cantilever beam, where ω is the external frequency and is set close to the experimental
second natural frequency, 8.6Hz. Note that the theoretical second natural frequency
is 8.67Hz. The force driving point is at x = 60 mm. First ﬁve bending modes are
considered in the calculations and the modal damping is ξ = 0.015 for all modes.
The external force f0 varies from 0.4 N to 14.4 N.
Figure18b shows the nondimensional response amplitude, wtip/L at the tip for the
external force amplitude from 0.4 N to 14.4 N for the theoretical computations and
1.42 N to 13.2 N for the experiment. For comparison the results without the electric
coupled equations are also plotted in this ﬁgure. It is found that the nonlinear forces
are dominated by those of the structure. The linear and nonlinear electric forces
induced by the piezoelectric patch and piezo ﬁlm sensor are smaller. The correla-
tion is reasonably good, but there are some differences between the computations
and experiment. The source of the difference may come from both the computa-

tional model and the experimental measurement. The theoretical modal damping
does not exactly match the experimental model, because it varies when the excita-
tion frequency is equal to the second natural frequency. Also for the experimental
measurement it is difﬁcult to control the excitation frequency to be at exactly the
second natural frequency. Although there are some differences, these results still
provide a good experimental veriﬁcation of the inextensible beam theory.
The theoretical output sinusoidal voltage signal generated from the piezoelectric
patch converts to a DC voltage through an AC/DC convert circuit and is directly con-
nected with the capacitor. The algorithm of the conversion is based on the assumption
that the external electric circuit has a small effect on the voltage output of the piezo-
electric patch, and hence the amplitude of the voltage output on the patch remains
unchanged during the charging process. The DC amplitude remains the AC ampli-
tude. The experimental output voltage signal generated from the piezoelectric patch
converts to a DC voltage through an AC/DC convert circuit. The electric circuit is
shown in Fig.18c.

Fig. 19 Power extraction from a force vibration: output DC voltage (a) and power extraction (b)
from #4 piezo ﬁlm sensor
Figure19a shows the DC output voltage at #4 piezo ﬁlm sensor and the external
force amplitude from 0.4 N to 14.4 N. As expected the DC output voltage increases
as the external force increases. The correlation is reasonably good, but there are some
differences between the computations and experiments. The source of the error may
come from the determination of the piezoelectric properties such as the coupling
constants, ep
31, et
31 and permittivity constants, ϵp
33, ϵt
33. Here the piezo ﬁlm coupling
constant is obtained from the experimental tip response and the corresponding AC
output voltage using the linear electric equation. Also the differences may come
from the AC/DC conversion. The theoretical AC/DC conversion assumes that the
peak value of the generated AC voltage from the piezo ﬁlm sensor is close to the
converted DC voltage. The experimental AC/DC convert has difference in these
voltages of about 8–10
Corresponding to this output voltage of the #4 ﬁlm sensor, the power extraction
can be calculated as
PDC = V 2
DC/R
where R is an effective resistance, R = 430k Ohm.
The theoretical and experimental correlation of a typical element is shown in
Fig.19b for the power output for piezoelectric patch, P-876A12 at #4. The correlation
is good.

electric network equations the ﬁnite-difference method is used to calculate the non-
linear responses, peak output voltage and power extraction of this piezoelectric-
aeroelastic system.
Figure20a shows the acceleration peak amplitude in g at the tip for ﬂow speeds
from 18.8m/s to 25m/s for the theory and 10 to 29.7m/s for the experiment. The the-
oretical tip acceleration as indicated by solid line rapidly increases as ﬂow speed
increases. For the experimental measurement, two different LCO responses for
increasing and decreasing ﬂow velocity were observed. The symbols, ◦plus bro-
ken line and • plus solid line, indicate the experimental results for increasing and
decreasing ﬂow velocity, respectively. With increasing ﬂow velocity, we ﬁnd a jump
at U = 20.6m/s which is similar to the theoretical results at U = 18.8m/s as shown
by the solid line. As the ﬂow velocity increases further, the LCO amplitude that is
measured has a larger increase than that found from theory. When the ﬂow velocity
is decreased, we ﬁnd another jump at U = 18.87m/s as shown in Fig.21a and as
indicated by the symbol, • with a solid line. The experimental linear critical ﬂutter
boundary is estimated from this ﬁgure. An intersection between the extrapolated
LCO amplitude curve and the ﬂow velocity axis is deﬁned as the linear critical ﬂutter
boundary. The estimated experimental ﬂutter velocity is 20.36m/s and frequency is
6.4Hz. Corresponding to the experimental acceleration peak response, the measured
dominant LCO frequency are obtained. The theoretical and experimental LCO fre-
quencies are shown in Fig.20b. The experimental LCO frequency is similar to the
theoretical frequency. As shown in Fig.20a a hysteresis response was observed in
the experimental measurement but not in the theoretical response.
Corresponding to the DC voltage outputs of #3, P-876-A12 patch and the ﬁlm
sensors of #4 and 6, the DC power extraction can be calculated with the effective
resistance, R = 750k Ohm. Figure21a–c show the theoretical and experimental cor-
relation of power extraction versus increasing ﬂow velocity for patches #3, 4 and 6.

Fig. 21 Power extraction from a large aeroelastic response of partially covered model: power
extraction from piezoelectric patch at #3 (a) and piezo ﬁlm sensors at #4 (b) and #6 (c)
Considering the effect of experimental AC/DC converter on the power extraction, a
reference power, (PRef.) concept is introduced. This is deﬁned as
PRef. = V 2
AC,test/R
This means the AC/DC converter has zero voltage drop, i.e no energy loss in the con-
vert process. Thus, PDC = PRef.. Here VAC,test is the measured AC voltage output.
This reference power, “Ref. power”, is indicated in the ﬁgure. The electric power
extraction increases as the ﬂow velocity increases as expected. Film sensor #6 pro-
vides much lower power extraction than patch #4 although they are both ﬁlm sensors.

710
D. Tang and E. H. Dowell
This is because #6 patch is near the beam tip and the bending curvature velocity at #6
is smaller than those at #4 and also #3. Piezo patch #3 provides much larger power
extraction than patch #4. This is because #3 patch has a larger electric-mechanical
coupling coefﬁcient, e31, than those of ﬁlm sensor although the bending curvature
velocity at #3 is smaller than those at #4. It is also found that the theoretical results
are closer to the “Ref. power” results, i.e. the experimental results when the non-ideal
experimental AC/DC converter is neglected.
6.2.3
Aeroelastic Response and Power Extraction from Flag Flutter for
Fully Covered Model
As shown in Fig.17b of the fully covered model by the ﬁlm sensors, DT4-028 K/L,
the aeroelastic model is considered as a uniform ﬂag plate. The structural natural
frequencies and mode shapes can be calculated for a uniform cantilevered beam.
The experimental ﬁrst natural bending frequency is f1 = 1.44Hz. The theoretical
ﬁrst ﬁve (5) bending natural frequencies are 1.44, 9.02, 25.27, 49.5 and 81.86Hz. The
theoretical linear ﬂutter speed and frequency are U f = 21.25m/s and ω f = 6.24Hz.
The theoretical computations for the fully covered plate are similar to those for
the partly covered plate for the nonlinear structural modal and linear electric and
aerodynamic equations. The same algorithm and aerodynamic parameters are used.
Figure22a shows the acceleration peak amplitude in g at the beam tip for ﬂow
speeds from 19.27m/s to 28.15m/s. The theoretical tip acceleration as indicated by
solid line rapidly increases as the ﬂow speed increases. For the experimental mea-
surement, two different LCO responses for increasing and decreasing ﬂow velocity
were observed. The symbols, ◦plus broken line and • plus solid line, indicate the
experimental results for increasing and decreasing ﬂow velocity, respectively. With
increasing ﬂow velocity, we ﬁnd a jump at U = 23.03m/s which is similar to the
theoretical results at U = 23.03m/s as shown by the solid line. As the ﬂow velocity
increases further, the LCO amplitude measured has dropped down, but the theoretical
LCO amplitude continues to increase. This drop down phenomenon in the experi-
ment may be created by a effect similar to that of a nonlinear stalled airfoil because of
the large ﬂag motions. When the ﬂow velocity is decreased, another jump range from
U = 21.7m/s to 19.1m/s was found as shown in Fig.22a and as indicated by the
symbol, • with a solid line. The experimental linear critical ﬂutter boundary is esti-
mated from this ﬁgure. The experimental ﬂutter speed and frequency are 20.36m/s
and 7.25Hz. The correlation is reasonably good.
Figure22b show the theoretical and experimental AC output voltage from the
ﬁlm sensors, DT4-028K/L at #2. Due to different positions in the x axis, the output
voltages for #1 and #3 are different with #2. Near the root of the plate, #1 ﬁlm
provides a lower AC voltage output and #2 patch provides a higher AC voltage
output. This is because the bending curvature velocity at #2 is larger than those at #1
and also at #3. Due to hysteresis, the measured AC output voltage has two different
results for increasing and decreasing ﬂow velocity. The theoretical results are closer

Figure22c shows the theoretical and experimental correlation of power extraction
versus the increasing ﬂow velocity for the ﬁlm sensor of #2. Considering the effect of
experimental AC/DC converter on the power extraction, “Ref. power” is also plotted
in this ﬁgure. The electric power extraction increases as the ﬂow velocity increase
as expected. The ﬁlm sensor of #2 provides much higher power extraction than the
patches of #1 and 3. This is because #2 has the larger bending curvature velocity.
The theoretical results are reasonably close to both the “Ref. power” and the real
“Test” results.

extraction is based on a single ﬁlm sensor. The total power extraction should be and
is assumed to be the sum of each single ﬁlm sensor. The theoretical and experimental
correlation is reasonably good. In the total power extraction analysis, it found that
#2 ﬁlm sensor provides maximum contribution over the total power for both the
theoretical and experimental results. More than half of the total power extraction
comes from the ﬁlm sensors at #2 position. This means that it is very important to
consider the optimal position of the piezo patch or ﬁlm sensor.
Summarizing the correlation results, the following conclusion may be made.
1. The inextensible beam theory has been veriﬁed by the dynamic force vibra-
tion test with larger ﬂapping response. A good correlation between the theory and
experiment was obtained for the structural motion.
2. A large LCO response beyond the linear ﬂutter speed was observed from the
wind tunnel experiment and correlated with results from the computational model
for both experimental models. A good correlation for the linear ﬂutter speed veriﬁes
that the theoretical linear piezoelectric-aeroelastic model is accurate. A reasonably
good correlation for the LCO response shows the new computational code and the
nonlinear inextensible beam theory is useful. A hysteresis response of LCO in the
experimental measurement and amplitude drop down in the higher ﬂow velocity were
observed in the experiment, but not found in the computations.
3. The DC power extraction from the piezoelectric network equation depends on
the dynamic vibration amplitude or the LCO amplitude as well as the LCO mode and
the position of piezo patch or ﬁlm sensor along the ﬂow direction. This is because
the best position with a larger bending curvature velocity provides a larger power
extraction. Also the DC power extraction depends on AC/DC convert circuit and
there is an opportunity for improvement in the experimental model in this respect.
4. Given the complexity of the interaction among the structural deformation, the
aerodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld and the electrical ﬁeld, the agreement between experiment
and the computational model is in fact encouraging. The basic structural plus aerody-
namic model has been studied by the authors and others and reported separately. Not
surprisingly, the added complexity of the electrical ﬁeld leads to larger differences
in the results between the experiment and the computational model compared to that
of the aerodynamic plus structural model alone. However, it is clear that the basic
physics of the experiment is being captured by the theoretical/computational model.
But there is always room for improvement of course.

Conclusions
This overview of wind tunnel model design and testing conducted at Duke University
over the last twenty years has demonstrated that a standard low speed wind tunnel
may be used as a test bed for a wide range of models to investigate linear and
nonlinear phenomena in aeroelasticity. The data acquired have been used to validate
and improve theoretical/computational models that in turn have provided a basis for
high speed ﬂow prediction of comparable phenomena. Flutter, gust response, limit

cycle oscillations and energy harvesting have been among the fundamental physical
phenomena that have been studied for models with a range of nonlinear elements in
the structures (including freeplay and nonlinear geometric, i.e. strain-displacement
relations) or aerodynamic ﬂows (including ﬂow separation over bluff bodies and
airfoils at high angles of attack). Correlation between theory and experiment has
been encouraging and ever better as the state of the art has progressed.

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics
Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
Earl H. Dowell
Abstract Hypersonic ﬂight is a major technical challenge and substantial efforts
are currently underway to provide the understanding and technology required to
design and operate effectively and safely a hypersonic aircraft for commercial or
military purposes. Leyva [1] has recently described the essence of this challenge.
The present chapter provides a summary of the past, present and proposed work for
ﬂuid/structural/thermal dynamics interaction.
1
An Introduction and Overview
There are several key physical phenomena that can occur in hypersonic ﬂight that
involve ﬂuid/structural/thermal/dynamics interaction (FSTDI). This chapter is not
a review of the all the many papers that have been published that one might cite;
there are literally thousands. It is an effort to bring some order to this complex
multidisciplinary topic for the beneﬁt of current and future research teams. In the
beginning of the discussion, issues involving only two disciplines are identiﬁed that
need further work as well as issues that are relatively well understood. Then the
discussion moves to issues involving three disciplines (FSI) and ﬁnally to FSTDI in
its full four discipline form.
To bring some order to the complexity, the focus will be on (1) response of struc-
tures to known turbulent ﬂows, (2) global dynamic instability of the ﬂow ﬁeld due to
shock wave/boundary layer interaction, (3) dynamic instability of the combined ﬂuid
structural system (ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations), and (4) effects of the thermal
ﬁelds on the foregoing as well as vice versa.
The discussion is inspired by the notion of simpler “unit projects” that are impor-
tant components of the full FSTDI challenge. In any of these projects a close inter-
action of theory/computations and experiments is needed. Theory/computation can
be a great help in designing and interpreting the results of experiments and of course
experiments can help assess the validity of the theoretical/computational model as

well as uncover previously unknown physical phenomena. In thinking about the role
of theory/computation in designing and interpreting experiments, it is useful to con-
sider theory/computation as being a map to our ultimate destination. Even if the map
is imperfect (as it always is), we are more likely to have a more productive and less
costly journey when using a map to design and interpret the results of experiments.
As Peretz Friedmann [2] has pointed out, building on the seminal work of John
Dugundji and John Calligeros [3] on aerothermoelastic scaling, the total number
of signiﬁcant non-dimensional parameters relevant to FSTDI and which must be
accounted for in both theory and experiment is very large. Indeed it is not possible to
design a model scale experiment that has all of the same (and potentially important)
non-dimensional parameters as a full scale vehicle. Hence any experiment can at
most represent an idealization of what the full scale vehicle will experience; but
model scale experiments can be very valuable if all the relevant non-dimensional
parameters are taken into account in the design of the experiment and the results
correlated with current and future theoretical/computational models.
Thesenon-dimensionalparametersincludethefollowing:Machnumber,Reynolds
Number, the ratio of ﬂow dynamic pressure to structural stiffness, the ratio of ﬂuid
mass to structural mass, the ratio of static pressure loading to structural stiffness, and
the ratio of thermal stress induced by a temperature difference between the ﬂexible
structure and its surrounding structure to ﬂexible structure stiffness as well as the
geometry (e.g. length to width ratio) and boundary conditions of the structure. When
multiple disciplines are involved the number of relevant non-dimensional parameters
is indeed daunting.
Even for classical wing ﬂutter, in experimental models, usually only the Mach
number and ﬂow dynamic pressure to structural stiffness are the same at model scale
and full scale while the Reynolds number and the ratio of ﬂuid mass to structural
mass are not. This choice is dictated in part by necessity and in part by theory which
suggests that the results are usually less sensitive to these latter two parameters. For
the greater number of relevant parameters for FSTDI in hypersonic ﬂow, theory and
computations are even more valuable as a guide to the design and interpretation of
experiments.
1.1
Two Disciplines Interaction
These multidisciplinary interactions can be usefully depicted in the form of a matrix
as shown in Fig.1 where both the horizontal and vertical components are four dimen-
sional, i.e. representing the (F) ﬂuid, (S) structural, (T) thermal and (D) dynamics
disciplines.
The elements of this matrix have either XXX suggesting this two discipline inter-
action is very challenging and important to FSTDI; XX suggesting it is challenging
and may be important or X suggesting the interaction is not as challenging to model
and may usually be considered separately from FTSDI per se. Of course different
observers may have different views on this categorization of the several elements

719
Fig. 1 Two disciplines interaction
and indeed as advances or new discoveries are made, the assessment of the elements
of this matrix may change. Note that the matrix is symmetric.
Also note that there are only six unique elements in the matrix. The evaluation
of the six X, XX, or XXX elements (at least in the authors’ minds) are justiﬁed as
follows.
Fluid/Structural (FS) Interaction: This describes the static deﬂection of the struc-
ture under ﬂuid loading and also a possible change in the steady ﬂow over the
structure due to the static structural deformation. This is a well-studied issue and the
interaction is usually modest and well understood.
Fluid/Thermal (FT) Interaction: This is the heating due to ﬂuid ﬂow and is well
studied even without reference to FSTDI per se.
Fluid/Dynamics (FD): This name can be confusing because the study of ﬂuids in
general is often called ﬂuid dynamics. But here we are concerned with time depen-
dent phenomena and, in particular, the dynamics of turbulence due to the transition
from laminar to turbulent ﬂow as a consequences of the laminar ﬂow becoming
dynamically unstable. Note however that even when the ﬂow has become turbulent
a further dynamic instability may occur due to separated ﬂow arising from shock
wave-boundary layer interaction. Some would say that this interaction is the most
demanding to model in all of FSTDI both theoretically/computationally and exper-
imentally. The dynamics of turbulence and shock-wave boundary layer interaction
represent two of the great unsolved problems in engineering and science and both pro-
vide an important source of excitation that may lead to signiﬁcant structural response.
Given that both phenomena represent the nonlinear dynamics of a ﬂuid arising from
dynamic instabilities they may prove to share certain fundamental characteristics.
Thermal/Structural (TS): Buckling of the structure due to thermal stress is perhaps
the most important issue here and again this issue is well studied even without

720
E. H. Dowell
considerations of FSTDI. However there is a concern that a buckled structural may
increase the heat transfer to the structure from the ﬂuid and this is the theme of a
wind tunnel investigation by Michael Spottswood and his team at AFRL [4] that was
conducted in 2019.
Structural/Dynamics (SD): Determining the natural modes and frequencies of
a structure is an essential part of any FSDI or FSTDI investigation. However when
ﬂexible plates are clamped (or pinned or otherwise ﬁxed) on all edges or two opposite
edges, they will often have natural modes and frequencies that are sensitive to static
pressure and thermal loadings. Thus the SD investigation needs to be more extensive
when these two types of loadings are important, as they often are in high speed ﬂows.
Thermal/Dynamics (TD): Usually the dynamics of the thermal ﬁeld is not a major
concern on the time scale of interest for FSDI and FSTD, though one should always
check make sure that neglecting this effect is well founded in a given experiment or
ﬂight vehicle design.
1.2
Three Disciplines (FSD) Interaction
Next, interactions among three disciplines are considered. There are several distinct
physical phenomena that may be of interest and a brief summary of the state of the
art and the need for further investigation is provided. Later in the chapter a more
extended discussion of available theoretical/computational results and experimental
resultsandtheircorrelationwillbeprovided.Thisisthebasisforthebriefassessments
of the state of the art provided below.
Flutter And Limit Cycle Oscillations
There is a well characterized set of experimental data [5, 6] for ﬂutter in the Mach
number range of M = 1.1–5 for plates clamped on all edges that has been well corre-
lated with theoretical/computational models. Qualitative experimental data are also
available for limit cycle oscillations that are consistent with theory and computations.
However quantitative experimental data for limit cycle oscillations are lacking. For
cantilevered plates, ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillation data are available for low sub-
sonic ﬂow that agree well with theory/computation [7]. However experimental ﬂutter
data are lacking for all M > 1 for a cantilevered plate.
Plate Response To Turbulent Boundary Layer Pressure Oscillations And/Or
Engine Exhaust Flow Oscillations
A well-established theoretical/computational approach is available for determining
such responses given the oscillating pressures from measurements over rigid sur-
faces. It is thought that the aerodynamic damping due to structural motion can be
determined from a range of theoretical ﬂuid models, but experimental conﬁrmation
is lacking [6].

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
721
Buffet Or Flow Oscillations Due To Shock-Boundary Layer Interaction Lead-
ing To Separated Flow
It is now well established that such ﬂow oscillations are often due to a global dynamic
instability of the ﬂow (which may already be turbulent) and some success has been
obtained in correlating experiments and theoretical/computational model for airfoils
and wings. Most of the work has been in the transonic range where such phenomena
have been observed on high performance aircraft and in wind tunnel models. See
Gianellis et al. [8] for a recent review of the literature. The shock oscillations observed
in hypersonic ﬂow over ramps may have a similar character, but the theory is less
well developed and no successful correlation between theory and experiment has yet
been achieved [9–11].
Once the ﬂow oscillations are established then the structure may respond and
changes in the ﬂow pressure oscillations due to structural motion are thought to be
important. The ﬂow over a blunt cylinder that induces a Von Karman vortex street
is broadly analogous and successful correlations between theory and experiment
have been achieved for a cylinder supported on springs as an example of a ﬂexible
body. In this case, fully coupled ﬂuid structure dynamic interaction occurs. However
experiments are lacking for M > 1 for any structure including airfoils and wings [6].
Changes In The Flow Dynamics Due To Structural Motion
These changes are usually modeled theoretically by potential ﬂow theory or RANS
models for structural response investigations including ﬂutter. However a long sought
goal is to modify the dynamics of the ﬂow so that (1) the transition from laminar to
turbulent ﬂow is delayed or (2) the intensity level of turbulence is reduced. Despite
great efforts over many years at low speeds as well as higher speeds, this goal has
remained elusive. In a recent supersonic experiment over a ramp with a compliant
material (rubber) ahead of the ramp, Narayanaswamy [12] found that the pressure
oscillation on the ﬂexible wall near the shock location could be reduced. This is an
interesting result and provides a challenge to theoretical/computational models to
correlate with this experimental result.
1.3
Four Disciplines (FSTD) Interaction
The role of the thermal ﬁeld may be several fold. First of all the structure may buckle.
A buckled structure is more likely to ﬂutter if near the onset of the buckled condition
and the limit cycle oscillations may be larger than for an unbuckled plate. Indeed this
is true for any form of ﬂuid excitation of the structure, e.g. due to turbulent boundary
layer pressure oscillations or those due to an engine exhaust. For ﬂutter and limit
cycle oscillations there is a key experiment for a single elastic plate at M = 3 [5]
that has been well correlated with a theoretical/computational model. But additional
experimental data for a wider range of parameters is highly desirable.

722
E. H. Dowell
Some investigators are also concerned about material degradation due to high
temperatures, but this is a concern quite aside from FSTD interactions. As noted
previously there is concern that structural response may in turn increase the heat ﬂux
to the structure. Also, for some reentry vehicles, striations have been observed on
the nose cone that it is suggested are due to the interaction of the ﬂuid forces and
viscoelastic nature of the structure induced by high heating rates. However the data
in the open literature are not yet conclusive.
1.4
Distinction Between a Plate with All Fixed (Clamped)
Edges and a Cantilevered Plate (Clamped on One Edge
Only)
Much of the recent interest in FSTDI has been for plates that are clamped on all edges
or a cantilevered plate that is clamped only at its leading edge [13–23]. Within the
framework of linear structural theory, there is no fundamental distinction between
the two conﬁgurations with respect to the natural modes, the onset of ﬂutter or the
response to ﬂuid ﬂuctuations in the boundary layer (with or without shock waves and
ﬂow separation). However in experiments and within the framework of nonlinear
theory for plate response to boundary layer pressure oscillations or the onset of
ﬂutter and the nature of the limit cycle oscillations, there are important fundamental
differences between the two plate conﬁgurations as follows [5–7].
In a well-designed experiment for plates clamped on all edges, the static pressure
differential across the plate and the thermal stresses must be controlled as they can
substantially change the plate natural frequencies, the plate dynamic response to
turbulent pressure oscillations, the onset of ﬂutter and the amplitude of the limit
cycle oscillations. Also it is desirable to measure the natural modes and frequencies
for the anticipated range of static pressure differentials and thermal stresses.
By contrast for a cantilevered plate, with ﬂow on both sides of the plate the static
pressure differential need not be controlled to the same degree, provided the ﬂow is
unobstructed and ﬂows smoothly on both sides of the plate. However the ﬂows on
both sides of the panel may interact through the motion of the plate and this must be
taken into account in the theoretical/computational models. Also the thermal stresses
will be relieved because of the free edges of the cantilevered plate; thus the control
of thermal stresses is less of an issue for a cantilevered plate than a plate with more
restrained boundary conditions.
In the post ﬂutter/limit cycle regime the response of plates clamped on all sides
is also quite different from the response of a cantilevered plate. For an all clamped
panel the amplitude of the limit cycle oscillations (LCO) will be on the order of the
thickness of the plate if the plate is initially ﬂat. If the plate has curvature (either
due to its manufactured shape or due to plate buckling), then the amplitude of the
LCO will be on the order of the height of the plate above the plane formed by the
plate edges (rise height). By contrast, for a cantilevered plate, the amplitude of LCO

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
723
will be on the order of a signiﬁcant fraction of the plate chord. For subsonic ﬂows,
both theory and experiment show that the ﬂow over a cantilevered plate remains
attached and nonlinear ﬂuid effects are modest. The dominant nonlinearities are in
the plate. However if the ﬂow has shocks and/or the ﬂow is separated then nonlinear
aerodynamic effects may be expected as well. The cantilevered plate is relatively
unexplored both theoretically/computationally and experimentally for M > 1 [7].
Also it might be noted that in subsonic ﬂow, plates with various other edge support
conditions have been studied including plates with only side edges clamped and also
all edges clamped except for the trailing edge which is free. Also studied in subsonic
ﬂow is the case of a cantilevered plate at various yaw angles to the oncoming ﬂuid
ﬂow. It would be very valuable to extend these studies to M > 1.

Correlations of Theory and Experiment
2.1
Introduction
There are several physical phenomena of interest as described below. Usually in a
given experiment or computational model, only one of these is the principal focus.
However it has happened that more than one of these have occurred in a single
experiment, though not always planned.
2.2
Physical Phenomena of Interest
The principal physical phenomena of interest are the following:
1. A turbulent boundary layer or jet excites a ﬂexible structure (panel or control
surface) with random-like pressure ﬂuctuations possibly leading to short-time
or long-time (fatigue) failure. An open question is to what degree the structural
motion might in turn change the ﬂuid ﬂow.
2. A shock wave oscillates ahead of or on the ﬂexible structure. The basic physical
mechanism that causes the shock oscillations (even in the absence of structural
motion) is still unresolved. The two prime candidates are (1) the shock and ﬂow
ﬁeld are excited into a resonance due to the turbulent boundary layer pressure
ﬂuctuations as considered by Touber and Sandham [24] and/or (2) the ﬂow ﬁeld
becomes dynamically unstable and creates a limit cycle oscillation that is most
visible in the shock motion, e.g. see Crouch [25]. Both physical mechanisms
involve shock wave boundary layer interaction. There is a substantial literature
on the second physical mechanism at lower Mach numbers especially in the
transonic range, e.g. see the recent review paper by Giannellis [8].
3. A fully coupled ﬂuid structure interaction (FSI) may lead to a dynamic insta-
bility (ﬂutter) and subsequent limit cycle oscillation of the structure and ﬂow.

724
E. H. Dowell
This may include shock wave boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) as well, but
can occur even when SWBLI is not a major contributor. Structural failure is the
primary concern when ﬂutter and/or limit cycle oscillations occur.
4. Fluid ﬂow-structural-thermal coupling may lead to (1) buckled structures and (2)
possibly substantial increases in heat ﬂuxes. Often this issue can be treated as a
static (rather than a dynamic) phenomenon. However if oscillating ﬂuid forces
act on a buckled structure, the structural response may be substantially greater
than for an unbuckled structure, if near the onset of buckling. Conversely, if the
structure is well into the buckled regime, it may be stiffer than the unbuckled
structure.
2.3
Key Parameters for Experiments and Theory
One of the major challenges of ﬂuid structure interaction at any Mach number is the
large number of physical parameters that must be taken into account in designing an
experiment and must be included in a mathematical model that hopes to correlate
with experimental results. On the ﬂuid side there is the Mach number and Reynolds
Number, while on the structural side there are of course the geometrical and mate-
rials constants. But when ﬂuid structure interaction is important there are several
additional non-dimensional parameters that are of interest including the ratio of ﬂuid
to structural mass, the ratio of ﬂuid pressure to structural stiffness forces and also the
ratio of static pressure differential across the structure to stiffness forces and the ratio
of thermal stress forces to structural stiffness forces. Formally other non-dimensional
parameters appear as discussed in some depth by Dugungji and Calligeros [3] and
more recently by Friedmann [2]. But even the parameters mentioned above lead to
the following formidable list.
M: Mach number (almost always matched in a wind tunnel experiment or ﬂight
test program)
Re: Reynolds number (almost never matched in a wind tunnel experimental pro-
gram, unless there is substantial evidence that viscous effects are important)
μ: Ratio of ﬂuid to structural mass; typically this ﬂuid density multiplied by
a characteristic length (e.g. wing chord) divided by structural mass per unit
area or ﬂuid density multiplied by a characteristic length cubed divided by
the total mass of the structure (often not matched in wind tunnel experiments
and usually less important than the next parameter)
: Ratio of ﬂuid pressure forces (e.g. ﬂuid dynamic pressure) to structural stiff-
ness forces (e.g. mass per unit area multiplied by a natural frequency squared
multiplied by a characteristic length) (almost always matched in wind tunnel
experiments and ﬂight tests)
P: As above with dynamic pressure replaced by the static pressure differential
acting across the structure. (For thin panels this parameter is critical and in

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
725
early wind tunnel experiments this parameter was uncontrolled and unmea-
sured which often led to great scatter in the measured data.)
T : As above with pressure replaced by the temperature differential between the
ﬂexible structure and a connected ﬁxed structure multiplied by the thermal
expansion coefﬁcient and the modulus of elasticity. (Thin panels are easily
buckled due to thermal stresses in a high speed ﬂuid ﬂow and this parameter
is critical to modeling this effect.)
2.4
Representative Correlations of Theory and Experiment
Here several representative results are discussed for the various physical phenomena
of interest which will give insights into the state of the art for both computational
models and experiments.
Structural Response to Pressure Oscillations from a Turbulent Boundary Layer
or Jet Noise
The standard theoretical/computational model on this topic dates to early work of
Coe and colleagues at NASA Ames Research Center and Maestrello and colleagues
at NASA Langley Research Center. Readily accessible treatments of the standard
model are available in the books by Lin [26], Dowell [27] and Dowell and Tang
[28]. In the standard theoretical and computational models the pressure oscillations
are taken from measured data and simple scaling laws are used to make a universal
model for the pressure acting on the structure. The key parameters for expressing the
pressures, p, are the ﬂow dynamic pressure, q; Mach number; and reduced frequency,
k = ωc/U where c is a characteristic length which might be the boundary layer
thickness or the jet engine nozzle diameter.
This the following non-dimensional relationship is often assumed with a possible
(usually weaker) dependence on Reynolds number,
p/q = F(M, k)
Note the pressure is usually expressed in the frequency domain in terms of its power
spectra. With the pressure modeled, standard methods random vibration analysis are
then used to compute the structural response. A compact discussion of this approach
appears in Crandall and Mark [29] and Dowell [27].
A key uncertainty in such an analysis is the representation of the damping.
Although it is common to include a structural damping term in the model, usu-
ally the dominant physical source of the damping is the change in ﬂuid pressure due
to structural motion. This aerodynamic damping can be modeled and indeed often
requires the same model as that needed for dynamic stability (ﬂutter) analysis.
There are various comparisons between theory and experiment in literature, but
the uncertainties in the representation of the pressure loading and damping have often
led to at best only qualitative agreement between theory and experiment for structural

726

response levels. On the other hand, there is usually good agreement on the resonant
response frequencies and the theoretical models are often useful in comparing the
relative response of one structural conﬁguration to another. Also for intense noise
levels from a jet for example, the structure may respond well into the nonlinear range.
See the review of the literature by Clarkson [30].
Shock Wave Oscillations Arising from Interaction with a Boundary Layer
There are three relative recent overviews of this topic that are highly recommended
due to Dolling [9], Clement and Narayanaswamy [10] and Gaitonde [31]. The title
of the 2001 article by David Dolling, “Fifty Years of Shock Wave/Boundary Layer
Interaction Research: What Next?”, is a reminder that this is a long standing and chal-
lengingissue. Determiningthecauseof shockoscillationis important for applications
and still an open question. It is often perceived to be a low frequency phenomenon
since a reduced frequency based upon boundary layer thickness is much less than 1.
Or to say it another way, if we assume the proper scaling for frequency is in terms of
reduced frequency, then the characteristic length scale is much larger than a bound-
ary layer thickness. This is perhaps initially surprising, but recent work at transonic
Mach numbers has shown that in fact shock oscillations may occur due to interaction
of the shock with a separated ﬂow and the characteristic length scale is the airfoil or
wing chord. Thus the reduced frequency with this characteristic length is of order 1.
Note that it is now accepted that shock oscillations in ﬂow over ramps in hyper-
sonic ﬂow do involve interaction of the shock with ﬂow separation. See Clemens and
Narayanaswamy [10]. They present a reduced frequency based upon the amplitude of
the shock oscillation and it is also much less than 1; but is essentially and remarkably
constant for a wide range of ﬂow geometries. They also note the shock oscillation
when it occurs has an amplitude proportional to the separation length. Since the sep-
aration length is much larger than the shock oscillation amplitude, it may be that the
characteristic length scale might better be based upon the former rather than the latter.
However both shock oscillation amplitude and separation length are outputs (results)
rather than inputs (causes), so that still leaves open the question of what length scale
is best used to predict the onset of shock oscillations. Recent work suggests it may
be the distance from the leading edge to the shock location.
Dynamic Instability (Flutter) and Limit Cycle Oscillations
When ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations occur, the integrity and possible failure of the
structure is of great concern. A fuller discussion of some of these results is available
in Dowell [5] including citations to the original research articles.
As seen in Fig.2, there is good correlation between theory and experiment for the
Mach number range from 2 to 5. For the lower Mach number range the measured
dynamic pressure for ﬂutter was above that computed by an inviscid aerodynamic
model. Later it was discovered that the viscous boundary layer accounted for this
difference was associated with a change in the ﬂutter mechanism from coalescing
frequency ﬂutter for the higher the Mach numbers to single degree of freedom ﬂutter
in the ﬁrst panel mode at the lower (but still supersonic) Mach numbers.

The now classic experiment of Muhlstein and Gaspers [5] for the lower supersonic
Mach number range controlled the thickness of the boundary layer. Results are shown
in Fig.3a for zero boundary layer thickness (as extrapolated) and a boundary layer

a shear layer model (where viscosity is included in the mean steady ﬂow, but not in the
dynamic perturbation due to panel motion) and also from a full RANS computation
by Hashimoto et al. [32]. The agreement between experiment and the two theoretical
models is very satisfying and suggests a good fundamental understanding of the
ﬂutter phenomenon for M < 5. Later experiments and computations by Vedeneev
[33] suggested that single degree of freedom ﬂutter in higher panel modes may also
occur when great efforts are made to minimize the boundary layer thickness and the
structural damping as well.
It is now well established that a static pressure differential across the panel can
stiffen the panel. This nonlinear effect raises the natural frequencies of the panel and
also increases the dynamic pressure required for ﬂutter. Figure4 shows theoretical
results for completely clamped edges and for edges which are clamped with respect
to motion normal to the panel but free to move in the plane of the panel. Also shown
are experimental results which agree more closely with the free in plane motion
model. This was also found to be true when comparing theoretical and experimental
results for the panel natural frequencies [not shown]. Citations on Figs.3, 4 and 5
are to the original references as discussed in [5].
A key experiment was performed at NASA Langley Research Center [5] and the
results are shown in Fig.5 in a plot of [non-dimensional] dynamic pressure at which
ﬂutter (and thus limit cycle oscillations) were observed versus a [non-dimensional]
temperature difference between the panel and its support structure. Typically the

panel temperature is higher and thus a compressive thermal stress is induced into the
panel that may lead to buckling. For the range of temperatures shown buckling did
indeed occur and thus there is hysteresis in the ﬂutter boundary. For a given level
of ﬂow dynamic pressure ﬂutter occurs at a certain temperature differential and then
ﬂutter stops at a yet higher temperature. This is because a buckled panel stiffens at
sufﬁciently high temperatures and thus stops the ﬂutter. This was the experimental
protocol followed and produces the “large disturbance” ﬂutter boundary shown in
the ﬁgure for both theory and experiment. However the theory also predicts a small
disturbance ﬂutter boundary that might be seen if the panel was initially buckled at
some temperature and then the ﬂow dynamic pressure was increased to reach this
ﬂutter boundary.
Another example of the subtlety of the ﬂutter phenomenon is that a curved plate
which is stiffer than a ﬂat plate may in fact have a lower dynamic pressure for ﬂutter if
the curvature is in the direction of the ﬂow. This is because the effect of the curvature
on panel stiffness is selective in that it raises the ﬁrst mode frequency, but does
not change the second mode frequency. Thus the two modal frequencies are closer
together due to curvature and ﬂutter is more likely. The experimental results are due
to Anderson [5] and the theoretical results are due to Dowell [5] and Amirzadegan
and Dowell [34]. In Fig.6 the ﬂutter dynamic pressure is plotted versus H/h where
H is the maximum rise height of the curved plate and h is the plate thickness. Note
that there is a theoretically predicted change in ﬂutter mode for H/h near 8 and a
near jump in the dynamic pressure. However the ﬂutter frequency does not change
radically (not shown).
There is also an early literature on ﬂutter of cylindrical shells and it would now
seem timely to revisit that conﬁguration. A recent paper by Cesnik [35] et al. on this
topicsuggestsrenewedinterestinthisconﬁguration.AlsoGoldmanetal.havestudied

that was motivated by a wind tunnel experiment at NASA Langley which showed
ﬂutter oscillations [36].
Limit Cycle Oscillations
There are few measurements of limit cycle oscillation (LCO) amplitude for M > 1.
However it is generally found that for ﬂat plates the LCO amplitude is of the order
of the panel thickness, h, while for a streamwise curved plate the LCO amplitude is
of the order of the rise height, H, as predicted by theory. There are more detailed
and quantitative measurements for M < 1 for a cantilevered plate, as well as other
boundary conditions, and these agree well with the appropriate structural theory, [7].
Fluid Flow-Structural-Thermal Interaction
Thermal stresses can substantially decrease the stiffness of the structure and this in
turn reduces the natural frequencies and make the structure more prone to experience
ﬂutter and limit cycle oscillations. If one of the resonant frequencies goes to zero
as the thermal stress reaches a critical level, then buckling may occur. Buckling is
a static instability, as distinct from a dynamic instability, and in some cases may be
tolerated. Moreover a buckled structure may recover its stiffness in the post-buckled
region. However the large static deformations associated with buckling may lead to an
increase in the heat ﬂux due the “aerodynamic roughness” of the deformed structure.
This is an important issue that is not well explored in the open literature. However
there is experimental and theoretical/computational work underway to address this
concern [4]. This is discussed elsewhere in this chapter and it is to be expected that
correlations between measurements and computations will be available in the near
future. Also one may buckle a relatively stiff structure with mechanical forces (rather
than thermal stresses) and measure the increase in heat ﬂux. The current experiment
by Spottswood and colleagues at AFRL is a notable effort in this regard [4].

Summary of the State of the Art Based upon Correlations
of Theory and Experiment and Opportunities to Advance
the State of the Art
Structural Response to Pressure Oscillations from a Turbulent Boundary Layer
or Jet Noise
A standard computational approach is available that relies on measurement of ran-
dom pressures due to a turbulent boundary layer or jet noise and an empirical model
of damping. Opportunities exist to improve this approach by using computational
ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations to compute these random pressure ﬁelds and var-
ious levels of aerodynamic modeling (from potential ﬂow theory to a Navier-Stokes
model) to represent the ﬂuid damping due to structural motion.
Shock Wave Oscillations Arising from Interaction with a Boundary Layer
The basic physical mechanism that leads to shock oscillations is still uncertain.
There is an opportunity for both Navier-Stokes based computational models and for
experiments to determine whether the basic mechanism is a result of a global dynamic
instability of the ﬂow ﬁeld (bifurcation) or the resonant response of the global ﬂow
to pressure ﬂuctuations in the boundary layer or possibly some combination of the
two mechanisms.
For recent developments in the transonic ﬂow range, see [37–39].
Dynamic Instability (Flutter) and Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO)
There is a now a substantial body of theoretical-experimental correlation evidence
for M < 5 that gives a basis for future progress in investigating the hypersonic
Mach number range, M > 5. Experiments for M > 5 are needed and these will
be challenging. However using the best available theoretical/computational models
should provide a ﬁrm basis for design of these experiments and correlation with
measurements. Thermal stresses may and likely will be important.
For recent work on the effect of a shock standing on the panel for ﬂutter and LCO,
see [40–43]. For a computational design study in support of a proposed hypersonic
plate ﬂutter experiment, see [44].
Fluid Flow-Structural-Thermal Interaction
It is well established that buckling of ﬂexible structures may occur in high speed
ﬂows and considerable effort in structural design is devoted to avoiding buckling or
making sure that a buckled panel does not lead to plastic deformation of the material.
However even elastic buckling (buckling deformation that occurs below the yield
stress of the material) may be a concern if it leads to higher heat ﬂuxes. Current
experiments are exploring this important issue [4].

Current Experimental Programs and Complementary
Computational Results
There are several experiments underway in hypersonic FSTDI. A brief description of
each is provided including preliminary comparisons between theory/computations
and experiment.
3.1
Air Force Research Laboratory (SM Spottswood, R Perez,
T Berberniss) with Computational Support from Duke
University (M Freydin, EH Dowell)
Several experiments were conducted at the AFRL Research Cell 19 (RC-19) facility
between the years 2011 and 2017 and they are continuing. The RC-19 is a continuous
Mach 1.5–3 supersonic wind tunnel modiﬁed to test elastic plates with an optional
impinging shock. The most recent set of experiments is described in detail in [45]
including an overview of previous related work. The experimental campaign was
aimed at testing new measurement techniques and produce data for validation of
computational methods and theoretical models. Full-ﬁeld measurement techniques
(3D DIC, PSP, TSP) allowed measuring the deformation, static pressure, and temper-
ature across the plate at sufﬁciently high sampling rates to allow dynamic analysis
of the ﬂuid-structure system.
Notable experiments include a transient wind tunnel start-up where a 30s mea-
surement of the plate deformation showed the onset of ﬂutter, a sporadic limit cycle
oscillation, and the ﬁnal stabilization of the plate which is attributed to buckling due
to aerodynamic heating. In a recent theoretical computation by Freydin et al. [46] a
qualitative correlation with experiment was demonstrated and the stability transitions
were analyzed using stability maps in the freestream static pressure versus tempera-
ture differential plane. Figure7 shows the measured and computed displacement at
25% chord versus time during the transient, supersonic wind tunnel start where ﬂutter
starts around 5s and stops near 25s. Temperature differential was measured during
the experiment near the edge of the plate and used in the theoretical computations.
However because the thermocouple was installed near one of the edges of the plate,
the measurement is not likely representative of the mean (or maximum) temperature
on the plate. To address this issue, several temperature differential scaling values
were considered. Figure8 shows a stability map for static pressure differential of
3kPa, which remained approximately constant during the experiment. Three temper-
ature differential scaling values are considered and their respective trajectory in the
stability plane is plotted with ‘x’ marking 5s intervals. Note that for scaling of one
the trajectory ends inside the ﬂutter region and the plate does not stabilize during the
30s transient. Also note that the stability map includes instability regions attributed
to two coupled mode instability labelled ‘Flutter’ as well as a cavity-plate coupling
instability labelled ‘A’ and ‘B’. For more details on Figs.7 and 8 see [46].

In another experiment, the static pressure differential was decreased by modulat-
ing the pressure inside a cavity and the freestream conditions were held constant.
An increase in LCO amplitude was measured at ﬁrst, while subsequent decrease in
static pressure differential caused the plate to intermittently transition between large
and small amplitude response. A similar behavior was observed in the theoretical
computations [46]. At the end of the set of experiments a high-cycle fatigue crack
was identiﬁed near the trailing edge of the plate.

Several experiments [47] have been conducted in a heated Ludwieg (hypersonic
expansion) tube, a facility in which compressed gas in a tube is suddenly released
and forms a pressure wave as it travels the length of a tube to the test section apparatus.
In this system, test times are on the order of less than one second. In the experiments
of interest, plates have been studied with varying boundary conditions to represent
several structural components of aircraft.
One experiment tested a cantilevered plate clamped at its leading edge to represent
a ﬂexible control surface. The plate was positioned with an initial angle of attack of
20◦to the freestream ﬂow, and the ﬂow conditions were well below the predicted
ﬂutter boundary. A schematic is shown in Fig.9. As expected, the plate statically
deﬂected due to the pressure differential across the plate, and measured motion was
a damped oscillation with a frequency near the fundamental resonant frequency of
the plate. Shown in Fig.10 are Schlieren images of the deﬂected plate at select times,
which show several characteristics of the system. Firstly, the leading edge shock
can be clearly seen, and the static as well as dynamic deﬂection of the plate can be
discerned by comparing time points. For this case, the damping was well predicted
by aerodynamic theory. It is interesting to note that the aerodynamic theory used to
correlate with experiment was piston theory which is the correct limit of potential
ﬂowtheoryathighMachnumber.Thefreestreamconditionwasthatbehindtheshock
of course. The Euler equations would also be expected to provide good correlation

the entire test plate is within the core ﬂow. The thick solid line on the Side View represents the
compression shock and the dotted lines are the expansion fan
with experiment and agree with potential ﬂow theory for the relatively small motions
measured. The good correlation between theory and experiment also suggests that
viscous ﬂow effects were not signiﬁcant for predicting the damping of the model.
Another experiment tested a ﬂat plate clamped at its leading edge with zero angle
of attack, but with an oblique shock impinging upon it to create a pressure differential.
A schematic of this system is shown in Fig.11. Again, the freestream ﬂow was
below the ﬂutter boundary, the plate experienced a static deﬂection with dynamic
oscillations around this deﬂection, and piston theory predicted nicely the pressure

Fig. 12 Schlieren imagery of the deﬂected cantilevered plate ﬁxed at its leading edge with an
impinging shock. Note the labeled characteristics. The dark line (2) is the impinging shock, which
causes the recirculation zone marked by the dark region under the dividing shear layer (5). Shocks
(3) and (7) stem from the separation and reattachment points, respectively
on the plate due to the ﬂow ﬁeld. However, there was more of an offset in pressure—
i.e. the system was not quasi-steady—because the deﬂection of the plate altered the
effects of the impinging shock. In other words, the deﬂected plate resulted in a weaker
shock because it introduces expansion waves. Figure12 shows the Schlieren imagery
from this case. In this experiment, it was shown that the boundary layer transitions
from laminar to turbulent in the area of separation over the plate, and that RANS
calculations under-predicted the heat transfer to the plate.
Plans are currently underway for a ﬂat plate clamped on its leading and trailing
edges to be tested with a nominal freestream Mach number of M = 5.8 and a local
Mach number behind the shock of M = 4.27. The plate is mounted on a wedge and
the angle of inclination of the wedge can be varied to change the local ﬂow including
the Mach number. The plate is designed to encounter ﬂutter for the ﬂow conditions
expected, which include a static pressure differential across the panel and thermal
stress within the panel, which raises and lowers the ﬂutter boundary, respectively.
Experimental challenges include the relative short test time—less than 1s—due to the
nature of the hypersonic expansion tube constraints. Flutter frequencies of several
hundred Hz are predicted and ﬂutter and subsequent limit cycle oscillations will
occur if, as designed, the effects of static pressure differential and thermal stresses
are offsetting. Figure13 shows a schematic of the model and Fig.14 shows a predicted
time history of the plate in a ﬂutter/limit cycle oscillation [44].

A ﬂexible plate with spanwise curvature is ﬁxed at its edges and embedded in an
otherwise rigid cone structure. It was tested in a hypersonic ﬂow at M = 6 and 8
and was well below the ﬂutter boundary as computed by the Duke University team.
Limited correlations between measured and computed natural frequencies showed
good agreement. The panel was responding to the random pressure ﬂuctuations in
the turbulent boundary layer augmented by spark excitation. Figure15a, b shows a
picture of the experimental model.

A ﬂat ﬂexible plate clamped on all edges has been tested at M = 4 with a shock
impinging on the plate. The plate has been constructed and correlations between the-
ory and experiment have made for the plate natural frequencies and modes. A shallow
cavity beneath the panel allows the static pressure across the panel to be controlled.
The acoustic dynamics of this cavity can change the lowest natural frequency of the
plate. This change can be accounted for by a well established theoretical model. A
schematic of the experimental model is shown in Fig.16.
In recent experiments [48], natural frequencies of the plate were measured in
several conﬁgurations: mounted with/without cavity, with static pressure differen-
tial, and with a uniform temperature differential. The cavity was found to have a
small stiffening effect on the ﬁrst natural frequency and a negligible effect on higher
modes. Static pressure differentials of up to 10psi was also shown to have negligible
effect on the natural frequencies. The relative insensitivity of the plate to these effects
allows the isolation of other effects planned for the wind tunnel experiment (shock-
wave boundary-layer interaction, aerodynamic heating). Lastly, the plate was heated
uniformly and the variation of natural frequencies versus temperature was measured

retical model that allows setting the stiffness of the in-plane boundary support [54].
It was shown that the tested plate has relatively soft in plane edge supports and that a
uniform temperature difference of up to 35K is expected to reduce the leading natural
frequencies of the plate by less than 10%. Note that for the limiting case of rigidly
ﬁxed in-plane edges, the plate is expected to buckle at 35K.

A ﬂexible square plate clamped on all edges has been tested at M = 6 in a NASA
Langley Research Center wind tunnel with ﬂow conditions well below the com-
puted ﬂutter boundary. The plate was mounted on a compression corner (with its
leading edge at the corner) and deformation was measured using photogrammetry
in response to the ramp-induced shock-wave boundary layer interaction. A picture
of the experimental model is shown in Fig.18. Static deformation on the order of
the plate thickness was measured and correlated with theory. Good agreement was
obtained when the combined effects of static pressure and temperature differentials
were considered with the nonlinear plate model.

Preliminary correlations between computations and experiment show that the nat-
ural frequencies of the ﬂuid-structure system are changed due to the ﬂow with the
static pressure differential and thermal stresses being the major contributors to these
frequency changes. Figure19 shows frequency (normalized by value measured out-
side of the wind tunnel f (2,2)
Exp = 3 kHz) versus ramp angle measured in the experiment
and obtained using theory with and without the effects of static pressure and temper-
ature differentials. Two papers have been published [49, 50] describing this work.
Initial correlations between theory and experiment are encouraging and further wind
tunnel experiments are planned in which the temperature distribution across the plate
as well as ﬂow properties behind the corner will be measured. Also the cavity beneath
the panel will be sealed and the pressure measured there. These additional measure-
ments will allow for a more complete and accurate correlation between theory and
experiment.

Computational Models and Methods
4.1
Computational Models (Fluids)
Fluid models may be at one of several levels including:
Model 1: Potential ﬂow model (with piston theory as the limiting case when M ≫1)
Model 2: Euler ﬂow model (includes the effects of shocks but ignores viscosity)
Model 3. Navier-Stokes model (includes shocks and viscosity)

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
741
Fig. 19 Normalized frequency vs. θ for mode (2, 2) [45]
In principle the models are more physically accurate as one moves from Model 1
to Model 2 to Model 3. However because the computational challenges also increase,
it is not always the case that a more accurate answer is obtained because of theoretical
and computational limitations. In particular the use of empirical turbulence models
remains a source of fundamental concern with respect to Reynolds Average Navier-
Stokes (RANS) models. While Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models (still empirical
but said to be an improvement on RANS models) and even Direct Navier-Stokes
(DNS) models are in principle feasible, only now are such computations underway
which show promise. But these are not currently and routinely used for FSTDI work.
4.2
Computational Models (Structures)
Model 1: Plates with all edges ﬁxed
Here the primary nonlinear physical effect is nonlinear stiffness which is well
described by the Von Karman plate theory for ﬂat and curved plates for which the
deﬂections are small (enough) compared to the plate length and width. Typically the
deﬂections are on the order of the thickness for a ﬂat plate and on the order of the rise
height for a curved plate. Efﬁcient and accurate computational methods are available
using a modal expansion. For simple geometries these modes are known and can

742
E. H. Dowell
Fig. 20 Schematic of cantilevered plate ﬁxed at its leading edge with supersonic ﬂow moving over
both sides
be prescribed analytically. For more complex geometries these modes need to be
determined by ﬁnite element computations or by using a component mode model.
Model 2: Plates with only one edge ﬁxed
Here the nonlinear deﬂections are much larger than those on the fully clamped plate,
i.e. on the order of the plate length. See Fig.20 for a schematic of a plate ﬁxed at its
leading edge with the trialing edge free. Flow moves over both sides of the plate from
left to right at high Mach number. For the cases examined to date, an inextensible
beam or plate model has proven accurate and again a modal based computational
method is efﬁcient. The inextensibility condition states that the arclength of the beam
(or the arclength of the ﬁbers in the two planar dimensions of the plate) is constant.
This allows for a simpliﬁcation of the potential energy expression of the beam or
plate, which is advantageous for FSTDI computations.
Recent work at Duke University [51] has explored the post-critical behavior of
a cantilevered plate in supersonic and hypersonic ﬂow. Researchers used the inex-
tensible beam model as the structural model (because spanwise bending is small)
coupled with Piston Theory as the aerodynamic theory of choice for ﬂows between
2 < M < 6. It was found that the model was very sensitive to the inclusion of sev-
eral nonlinearities in the mathematical model. For deﬂections on the order of the
beam length, the geometric nonlinearities include third order nonlinear stiffness and
nonlinear inertia. For these large deﬂections, third order Piston Theory was shown
to be more accurate than ﬁrst order Piston Theory. In addition, because of the large
slope of the beam, a geometric modiﬁcation to Piston Theory was added to ensure
that the pressure always acted normal to the instantaneous slope of the plate. This
modiﬁcation is normally negligible for cases of fully clamped or fully pinned beams
and plates, but for these large deﬂections it was shown that its inclusion is necessary
to develop bounded limit cycle oscillation (LCO) solutions. In fact, the nonlinearity
introduced by this modiﬁcation is strong enough to produce bounded LCO behavior
even for modeling cases with linear ﬂuid and structural models.
Figure21 compares the plate’s LCO behavior at Mach 4 for various modeling
conditions, and illustrates the sensitivity of the models to various nonlinear terms. It
shows the root mean square (RMS) of the beam tip during LCO versus the nondi-

mensional ﬂuid dynamic pressure parameter lambda. For each case the nonlinear
modiﬁcation to Piston Theory is included to ensure that pressure always acts normal
to the plate surfaces. For the case of linear ﬁrst order Piston Theory (1st PT) and
linear structural theory (LIN) in purple, the structural response is the smallest of
the group. Including third order Piston Theory (3rd PT) but keeping linear structural
theory, the result is slightly larger. This is due to the higher order Piston Theory terms
adding more dynamic pressure to the structure. However even larger is the case with
ﬁrst order Piston Theory but a fully nonlinear structure (FNL), offering insight into
the considerable effect of the nonlinear structural inertia which increases deﬂection
levels. Finally, the case with the largest deﬂection is that which employs third order
Piston Theory and fully nonlinear structural modeling. This case includes the most
physical nonlinearities in the model and therefore is thought to be the most accurate
to model a potential experiment. Note that the RMS response of this case is more
than double that of the linear ﬂuid and structural model, and this result should be
considered when planning an experimental effort.
To assess the accuracy of Piston Theory for this conﬁguration, an Euler CFD
simulation was performed at Mach 4 using the structural motion computed from
the modal solution to calculate pressures on the plate. See Fig.22 for a pressure
contour plot from the Euler CFD solution and Fig.23 for the comparison between
aerodynamic theories at the plate’s largest deﬂection. It can be seen that third order
Piston Theory is very accurate compared to the Euler solution for the range of lambda
values considered, whereas ﬁrst order Piston Theory is only accurate at lower lambda
levels.

deﬂection
Because in this conﬁguration the plate is free on three sides, thermal expansion
is not a cause of instability. Therefore, for this computational study thermal effects
were not included.
4.3
Computational Models (Thermal)
If the computation of the thermal ﬁeld can be done prior to the modeling of the ﬂuid
and structure and if the structural motion does not signiﬁcantly change the thermal
ﬁeld, then the thermal ﬁeld can be taken as an input to the ﬂuid-structure-dynamic
interaction computation. This approach has often proved sufﬁciently accurate and is
computationally efﬁcient. Thus the thermal ﬁeld is said to be “uncoupled” from the
rest of the computational model.
However, in those cases where the thermal ﬁeld is changed by the FSTDI, then
a more complex approach must be pursued including the coupled interaction of the
thermal ﬁeld model with the ﬂuid and structural models. When coupling the heat
equation with the structure and ﬂuid dynamics there are two main questions. First,

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
745
Fig. 23 Maximum aerodynamic pressure versus Lambda ratio of ﬂuid dynamic pressure to struc-
tural stiffness for Euler CFD, 1st order Piston Theory, and 3rd order Piston Theory
there is the question of time scale differences between the thermal and ﬂuid-structure
dynamics which may affect how the dynamic coupling is implemented. Thermal time
scales are typically orders of magnitude larger than that of the ﬂuid-structure and thus
the possible thermal model change is usually held constant for several ﬂuid-structure
time steps. The sensitivity of the solution to this assumption should be investigated for
each problem separately. It is expected that problems with complicated geometries
and impinging shocks should be more sensitive to the coupling time step than simpler
geometries with uniform ﬂow and without shocks.
The second question is how one models the heat ﬂux from the boundary layer
to the structure in super/hypersonic ﬂow. A widely used semi-empirical model is
the Eckert’s reference enthalpy method [52]. See Anderson [53] for an insightful
discussion of this model. In a temperature range where the heat capacity can be
assumed constant, the method is simpliﬁed to the reference temperature method.
This approach provides a simple relation between the ﬂow conditions at the edge of
the boundary layer above a point on the elastic structure, the local temperature of the
structure, and the local heat ﬂux. The accuracy of this model is well established for
rigid structures, but for the coupled FSTI experimental data is lacking.
The enthalpy reference method can be thought of as the rough equivalent of
Piston Theory for the aerodynamic heat ﬂux. However, in contrast to Piston Theory,
it is not easily incorporated in a modal ﬂuid-structure solver due to complicated
dependency of the heat ﬂux on the motion of the structure. Two main approaches
were considered to address this problem. One is solving the heat equation in physical
coordinates. This increases computational complexity because it adds an additional
step of transforming the thermal ﬁeld to modal coordinates and the displacement
ﬁeld to physical coordinates to implement the coupling. However because the time

746
E. H. Dowell
scale of the thermal ﬁeld is substantially longer than that of the ﬂuid-structure, the
heat equation terms may be evaluated less often. A second approach that is currently
under investigation is to linearize the temperature reference method in terms of the
local transverse downwash and the structure temperature. In physical coordinates,
this will result in the following heat ﬂux term,
Qaero ≈Awa + BT w + C,
wa = ∂w
∂t + U1
∂w
∂x
And in modal coordinates
Qaero = Ank ˙wk + U1Ankwk + BnkT w
j + Cn
The coefﬁcients A, B, and C depend only on the chordwise coordinates x (due to
variation of the local Reynolds number) and can easily be incorporated in a modal
structural solver. The local downwash term can be used with (1st or higher order)
Piston Theory to evaluate the local pressure change at the edge of the boundary layer
(and compute all other parameters) to include the effect of structure motion on the
thermal ﬁeld.
More accurate models for aerodynamic heating include the boundary layer theory,
on which the semi-empirical method of reference enthalpy is based. And of course
the above discussed Navier-Stokes model can be used. When strong gradients in the
temperature ﬁeld of the ﬂuid are expected, for example due to shock-wave boundary-
layer interaction, only the latter ﬂow model is expected to provide accurate results
for the local heat ﬂux near the surface of the structure.

Concluding Remarks on the State of the Art and
Prospects for Future Work
A turbulent boundary layer or jet excites a ﬂexible structure
To predict the response of a ﬂexible structure one needs to know (1) the oscillating
pressures from the ﬂow ﬁeld even in the absence of structural motion and (2) then
also the ﬂuid pressures due to the structural motion. Computations and experiments
are underway to determine (1) and, if good correlations are obtained, this will give
important conﬁdence in the use of CFD models. Such models may be at the RANS,
LES or DNS level. For (2) the ﬂow model need not be the same as for (1). Indeed
what is sometimes called Enhanced Piston Theory (i.e. piston theory with the local
spatial ﬂow parameters such as Mach number and static pressure determined from
steady ﬂow CFD computations or experiment) may often be sufﬁcient.
Once the panel motion is determined, a CFD simulation with now known panel
motion may be used to assess the change in the ﬂow ﬁeld due to panel motion.

Fluid/Structural/Thermal/Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) in Hypersonic Flow
747
Studies to determine the elements of all of the above are underway by various
investigators.
A shock wave oscillates ahead of or on the ﬂexible structure
Determination of the physical source of the shock oscillations due to shock wave
boundary layer interaction is a challenge of long standing and still an active area of
research. As mentioned earlier there is still some uncertainty about the fundamental
physical mechanism. However recent work suggests that a global dynamic instability
of the ﬂow ﬁeld may occur under certain conditions, e.g. when a ramp angle reaches
a certain critical value. This fascinating subject is discussed in detail from a FSTDI
perspective in an Appendix C with citations to the relevant literature. An assessment
of the current state of the art and the identiﬁcation of tasks to advance the state of
the art are also provided in the appendix.
A fully coupled ﬂuid structure interaction leading to ﬂutter and limit cycle
oscillations (LCO)
The state of the art is generally satisfactory when the ﬂow is attached and Enhanced
Piston Theory may be used to describe the oscillating ﬂuid pressures due to structural
motion. But for separated ﬂows this is a topic of active research. Often the challenge
is to characterize fully all the many ﬂow and structural parameters that may inﬂuence
the onset of ﬂutter and LCO. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of in
plane as well as out of plane boundary conditions, curvature, and mechanical and
thermal loadings for the structure.
Fluid ﬂow-structural-thermal coupling may lead to (1) buckled structures and
(2) possible substantial increases in heat ﬂuxes
Experiments are underway and new computational models have been developed and
correlations of experimental and theoretical data are now possible. There is reason
for cautious optimism.

Appendix A
A Primer for Structural Response to Random
Pressure Fluctuations
A.1
Introduction
In this appendix1 we shall treat the response of a structure to a convecting - decaying
random pressure ﬁeld. The treatment follows along conventional lines after Powell
[1] and others. That is, the pressure ﬁeld is modelled as a random, stationary process
whose correlation function (and/or power spectra) is determined from experimental
measurements. Using this empirical description of the random pressure, the response
of the structure is determined using standard methods from the theory of linear
random processes [2,3]. The major purpose of the appendix is to provide a complete
and detailed account of this theory which is widely used in practice (in one or another
of its many variants). A second purpose is to consider systematic simpliﬁcations to
the complete theory. The theory presented here is most useful for obtaining analytical
results such as scaling laws or even, with enough simplifying assumptions, explicit
analytical formulae for structural response.
Itshouldbeemphasizedthat,ifforaparticularapplicationthesimplifyingassump-
tions which lead to analytical results must be abandoned, numerical simulation of
structural response time histories may be the method of choice [4,5]. Once one is
committed to any substantial amount of numerical work (e.g., computer work) then
the standard power spectral approach loses much of its attraction.
A.2
Excitation-Response Relation For The Structure
In the present section we derive the excitation-response relations for a ﬂat plate. It
will be clear, however, that such relations may be derived in a similar manner for any
linear system.

The equation of motion of the small (linear) deformation of a uniform isotropic
ﬂat plate is
D∇4w + m ∂2w
∂t2 = p
(A.1)
where w is the plate deﬂection, p the pressure loading and the other terms are deﬁned
in the Nomenclature. Associated with (I.1) are the natural modes and frequencies
of the plate which satisfy
D∇4ψn −ω2
nmψn = 0
(A.2)
where ωn is the frequency and ψn(x, y) the shape of the nth natural mode. In standard
texts it is shown that the ψn satisfy an orthogonality condition

ψnψmdxdy = 0 for m ̸= n
(A.3)
If we expand the plate deﬂection in terms of the natural modes
w =

n
qn(t)ψn(x, y)
(A.4)
then substituting (A.4) into (A.1), multiplying by ψm and integrating over the plate
area we obtain
Mm[¨qm + ω2
mqm] = Qm
m = 1, 2, . . .
(A.5)
where we have used (A.2) and (A.3) to simplify the result. Mm and Qm are deﬁned
as
Mm ≡

mψ2
mdxdy
Qm ≡

pψmdxdy
· ≡d/dt
(A.6)
For structures other than a plate the ﬁnal result would be unchanged, (A.5) and (A.6);
however, the natural modes and frequencies would be obtained by the appropriate
equation for the particular structure rather than (A.1) or (A.2). Hence, the subsequent
development, which depends upon (A.5) only, is quite general.
Before proceeding further we must consider the question of (structural) damping.
Restricting ourselves to structural damping only we shall include its effects in a gross
way by modifying (A.5) to read
Mm[¨qm + 2ζmωm ˙qm + ω2
mqm] ≡Qm
(A.7)
where ζm is a (nondimensional) damping coefﬁcient usually determined experimen-
tally. This is by no means the most general form of damping possible. However,

Appendix A: A Primer For Structural Response To Random Pressure Fluctuations
753
given the uncertainly in our knowledge of damping from a fundamental theoretical
viewpoint (see [6]) it is generally sufﬁcient to express our meager knowledge. If
damping is inherent in the material properties (stress-strain law) of the structure, the
theory of viscoelasticity may be useful for estimating the amount and nature of the
damping. However, often the damping is dominated by friction at joints, etc., which
is virtually impossible to estimate in any rational way.
Now let us turn to the principal aim of this section, the stochastic relations between

qmqn(ω) = Hm(ω)Hn(−ω)Qm Qn(ω)
(A.23)
Summarizing, the relations for correlation functions are (A.9), (A.15) and (A.22)
and for power spectra (A.13), (A.19) and (A.23). For example, substituting (A.19)

(A.24)
This is the desired ﬁnal result relating the physical excitation to the physical response
in stochastic terms.
A.3
Sharp Resonance or Low Damping Approximation
Often (I.24) is approximated further. Two approximations are particularly popular
and useful. The ﬁrst is the ‘neglect of off-diagonal coupling’. This means omitting
all terms in the double sum except those for which m = n. The second is the ‘white

756
Appendix A: A Primer For Structural Response To Random Pressure Fluctuations
noise’ approximation which assumes that p is essentially constant relative to the
rapidly varying transfer functions Hm(ω). Making both of these approximations in
(A.24) we may obtain the mean square response

· p(ωm; x, y, x∗, y∗)dxdy dx∗dy∗
(A.25)
Of course, only one or the other of these approximations may be made, rather than
both. However, both stem from the same basic physical idea: The damping is small
and hence, Hm has a sharp maximum near ω = ωm. That is
Hm(ωm)Hn(−ωm) ≪|Hm(ωm)|2
Hm(ωn)Hn(−ωn) ≪|Hn(ωn)|2
and the ‘neglect of off-diagonal coupling’ follows. Also

p|Hm(ω)|2dω ≈p(ωm)

|Hm(ω)|2dω
and (A.25) follows by simple integration.
Not that if we take the spatial mean square of (A.24) then using orthogonality
(for a uniform mass distribution)one may show that the off-diagonal terms do not
contribute (see Powell [1]).
Finally note that if we desire stress rather than deﬂection, then it may be shown
that analogous to (A.25)one obtains

as a function of K ′′ the right and left sides of this equation and note the points (if
any) of intersection. The ﬁrst intersection for K ′′ > 0 is the one of physical interest.
Knowing this particular K ′′, call it K ′′
D, one may compute

Questions
Sweptwing divergence
6. Derive the equations of equilibrium and associated boundary conditions, (2.6.1,
2.6.2, 2.6.11 and 2.6.12) from Hamilton’s Principle. Note that Hamilton’s Principle
is the same as the Principle of Virtual Work for the present static case.
For a constant property sweptwing undergoing bending only, use classical solution
techniques to compute the lowest eigenvalue corresponding to divergence. That is
from (2.6.10)–(2.6.12), show that λd = −6.33.

• Now use Galerkins method to compute an approximate λD. For h, assume that
h = a0 + a1 ˜y + a2 ˜y2 + a3 ˜y3 + a4˜4
From the boundary conditions (2.6.11), (2.6.12) show that
a0 = b0 = 0
a3 = −4a4
a2 = 6a4
and thus h = a4( ˜y3 −4 ˜y3 + 6 ˜y2). Using this representation for h, compute λD. How
does this compare to the exact solution?
• Now consider both bending and torsion for a constant property wing. Assume
α = b0 + b1 ˜y2 + b2 ˜y3
Determine the possible form of α from the boundary conditions.
Determine λD for G J/E I = 1, ¯e/¯c = 0.5, l/¯c = 10. Compare to the earlier
result for bending only. Plot your result in terms of ˜λD vs  where ˜λD ≡q(∂¯CL/∂α)
(¯cl3/E I).

ﬂutter is possible. This is similar to the ﬂutter behavior of the typical section at
incompressible speeds. At these low speeds mass ratios of this magnitude may occur
in hydrofoil applications. Although no such applications exist at high supersonic
speeds, it is of interest at least from a fundamental point of view that this somewhat
surprising behavior at small μ occurs there as well.

It is a useful and interesting exercise to determine pressure distributions, lift and

Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction in
Hypersonic Flow—A Fluid Structures Thermal
Dynamics Interaction (FSTDI) Perspective
The ﬁeld of ﬂuid dynamics has had many successes over the years in providing a
rigorous and practical framework for developing basic understanding of complex
physical phenomena of great interest. Yet some phenomena are still not well under-
stood fundamentally or in practice. Perhaps foremost of these is turbulence, but
surely not far behind in terms of importance and lack of understanding is shock
wave/boundary layer interaction in high speed ﬂows. Here a discussion of proposed
work to study the linear and nonlinear dynamics of shock wave/boundary interaction
is provided for a canonical geometry to test the hypothesis that the dangerous shock
oscillations and enhanced heating that has been observed in wind tunnel experiments
and in ﬂight are due to a global instability arising from a bifurcation of the steady
ﬂow ﬁeld when key parameters are changed including geometry, Mach number and
Reynolds number.
C.1
Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction in
Hypersonic Flow—A Brief Review of the Literature
and a Proposed Research Approach
Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction (SWBLI) has been studied for many years
and several excellent reviews of this challenging and still not well understood topic
have been published [1–4]. The ﬁrst of these was published in 2001 by David Dolling
with the title “Fifty Years of Shock-Wave Boundary Layer Interaction Research:
What Next?” That is still the question nearly 20years later. More recent reviews by
Clemens and Narayanaswamy [2] and Gaitone [3] and Girannelis, Vio and Levinski
[4] are informative, but the source of the basic physical mechanism that leads to
shock oscillations and hence enhanced heating and strong excitation of a ﬂexible
structure underneath the shock is still in question.
One hypothesis is that the shock oscillations arise from the pressure ﬂuctuations
in a turbulent boundary layer forcing the shock in a resonant ﬂuid mode [5]. Yet

Fig. C.1 a Incident impinging shock, after Robinet and b ramp, after Mallinson, Gai, and Mudford
a different hypothesis is that there is a global instability of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Recent
work in transonic ﬂow supports the latter hypothesis [4,6–8], but little has been done
in the hypersonic regime except for the study by Robinet [9]. Robinet has studied
a laminar boundary layer on ﬂat surface with an incident shock impinging on the
surface from above and found that indeed a global dynamic instability may occur
in his computational model. See Fig.C.1. Moreover in the ﬂow geometry that he
studied there is a leading edge and the ﬂow separation that occurs is a signiﬁcant
fraction of the distance from the leading edge to the point of shock impingement.
And using this same characteristic length the reduced frequency, i.e. frequency (in
radians per unit time) multiplied by the characteristic length and divided by the ﬂow
speed, is of order 1. This is consistent with a scaling analysis of the Navier-Stokes
equations, e.g. see [10].
It would be especially valuable and timely to study the possibility of a dynamic
global instability at hypersonic speeds for two geometries, a two-dimensional ﬂow
over a ﬂat plate with a leading edge and (1) an impinging shock [9] or (2) followed
by a ramp [11]. The three-dimensional counterpart of the ramp conﬁguration would
be an axi-symmetric ﬂow over cone followed by a ﬂare. Note that even though the
geometry is axi-symmetric, the bifurcation to a global instability may lead to an
oscillating ﬂow that is three-dimensional and no longer axi-symmetric.
C.2
Proposed Approach
The proposed work is mathematical and computational, but with a close eye on
creating a computational base that can be evaluated and validated by experiment.
Indeed one of the goals of the research is to inspire and help guide a new approach to
experimental studies. The incident impinging shock, ramp and cone/ﬂare geometries
have been often studied in experiments, but not yet from a dynamical bifurcation
global instability perspective.

Appendix C: Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction in Hypersonic …

There are basically two approaches that can be taken in computational studies.
One is to do time simulations and that is the approached suggested here. However
an eigenvalue and frequency domain, harmonic balance approach is currently being
undertaken by Professor Kenneth Hall. The two approaches are complementary and
mutually supporting and will provide greater conﬁdence in the results of each study.
C.2.1
Flat Plate with a Leading Edge Followed by a Ramp
For deﬁniteness and brevity the two dimensional ﬂow over a ﬂat (splitter) plate with
a leading edge followed by a ramp will be discussed here. See Fig.C.1.
To begin the study we plan to do time simulations with various levels of
ﬂuid modeling, i.e. Euler, RANS and Direct Navier-Stokes using the well-known
ANSYS/Fluent CFD code. It will be an advantage to use the same code for all three
ﬂuid models. Note this code has been used successfully recently to do transonic buffet
computations where the buffet arises due to shock wave boundary layer interactions
[8]. It is now established that buffet in transonic ﬂow is a limit cycle oscillation due
to a global dynamic instability of the ﬂow. Some investigators claim that the onset
of buffet (the onset of shock oscillations) can be approximately determined using a
Euler code, though this assertion remains controversial. We will explore that possi-
bility. However it is clear that to determine the ﬂow separation and the consequent
(limit cycle) oscillations of the shock require at least a RANS and possibly a DNS
computational model.
C.2.2
Computational Protocol
The ramp will be allowed to move. It will be given a motion that may include a
step change in ramp angle or an oscillating ramp angle about a mean ramp angle.
The purpose of the ramp motion is to excite the ﬂow ﬁeld including of course the
shock and the separated ﬂow region. By varying the motion of the ramp the dynamics
of ﬂow may be determined even in the absence of ﬂow separation as well as with
ﬂow separation. Speciﬁcally the frequency and damping of the dominant ﬂuid modes
well be determined. More particularly the damping in the ﬂuid mode that leads to
a bifurcation as the mean ramp angle is increased will be tracked as the damping
of the dominant modes tends to a zero as a parameter is changed, e.g. mean ramp
angle, Mach number or Reynolds number. Then once the dynamic instability occurs
when the damping goes to zero and then changes sign, the amplitude of the shock
motion and separation length (and other ﬂow variables that may prove to be of
interest) will be tracked with systematic variations in ramp angle, Mach number
and/or Reynolds number. Also the amplitude of the oscillating ramp can be varied
to examine whether there is hysteresis in the bifurcation (global dynamic instability)

800
Appendix C: Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interaction in Hypersonic …
boundary and subsequent limit cycle oscillations. A similar protocol may be used
for an incident shock with the shock angle allowed to move.
C.2.3
Expected Outcomes
A reduced frequency (2π times the Strouhal number) will be computed based upon
various length scales in the conﬁguration to see if it indeed is of order 1 when based
upon the length from the leading edge to the beginning of the ramp or location of
the incident shock.
A theoretical scaling analysis will be done [10] to provide a qualitative check on
the computational results with respect to reduced frequency and amplitude of the
shock oscillations.
Perhaps most importantly the basic physical mechanism for shock oscillations
due to a global instability will be established and the dependence of this physical
mechanism on key physical parameters such as geometrical lengths, Mach number
and Reynolds will be explored.
Also this work will naturally lead to a consideration of axi-symmetric conical
ﬂows and other geometries of interest in the future.
And ﬁnally and importantly, the computational/theoretical results will provide a
foundation for new and creative experiments.
